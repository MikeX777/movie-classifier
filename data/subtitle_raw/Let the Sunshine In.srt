1
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,360
Over there.

2
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Will you finish?

3
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,520
Come.

4
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,000
Are not you ready?

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,640
Then get ready.

6
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,320
It's good, I feel good.

7
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,320
Then, come on.

8
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,920
Continue.

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640
Come on...

10
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,960
Did you get ready quickly
with your previous friend?

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
Treasure?

12
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Please talk to me.

13
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,600
Forget me.

14
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Please, I'm sorry.

15
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,480
Come.

16
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,160
So I will speak to you tomorrow?

17
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,360
Do I see you Sunday?

18
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,560
BRIGHT SUNSHINE IN

19
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,160
Good day!

20
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,000
Shopping in the neighborhood?

21
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,480
Tasty fish, right?
- Very tasty.

22
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,560
Is everything all right?

23
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,920
No.

24
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,920
Not me either, the old story.

25
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,880
We are never satisfied.

26
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,680
Things never go well.

27
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
They never fall into place at the same time.

28
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,640
So we satisfy our desires
in various ways,

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,840
but it never actually works.

30
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,640
I'm glad I'm bumping into you.

31
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
I wanted to call you.

32
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,120
I wanted to introduce you to
something that would do you good.

33
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,760
My mother, who died last year,
left me a beautiful country house.

34
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,360
Come along if you want.

35
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,000
Anytime you want.
You can come and go...

36
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
and stay as long as you want.

37
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Not now. I do not feel
very well at the moment.

38
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,400
So how are you?

39
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,920
For me...

40
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
Mrs?
What can I do for you?

41
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,560
Just think... I want...

42
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,240
Would not you call me?

43
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,640
Sorry, it did not work.

44
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
But I've been waiting
all weekend.

45
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,400
I am in love with you.

46
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,400
Then also take care of me a bit.

47
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,400
I can not always do what I want.

48
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Listen, this is simply not possible.

49
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,520
If you say you are calling, do so.

50
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,560
Or our relationship does not last long.

51
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,800
Dictatorship of the proletariat!

52
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,880
Sorry what did you say?

53
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,640
What?

54
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,400
I said 'dictatorship
of the proletariat'.

55
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,440
Does that irritate you?

56
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,440
It is only annoying when you
can not laugh at it. Yet?

57
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,160
Can not you?

58
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,800
Beautiful chair.

59
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,760
Did you masturbate this weekend?

60
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,760
You?
- No.

61
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
You've done the 'love'...

62
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,920
I am married.

63
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,200
Why else would there be whores?

64
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
No ice.

65
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,000
Take it back and bring
two empty glasses.

66
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,520
No big Perrier, a small one.

67
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,920
Put it here.

68
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,880
I pour in and you can
take it with you again.

69
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
Now you have it.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
Fine.

71
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,840
I know Maxime well.

72
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Your new...

73
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
collaborator.

74
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,920
Of course, I know that.

75
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,320
We have merged the
two galleries.

76
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,000
I did not know that.

77
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,680
But oh...

78
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,400
Logically that you know her.
In this environment...

79
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,200
As a banker you probably know everyone.

80
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,520
I knew her before she
started with the gallery.

81
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,920
I have known her for centuries.

82
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,160
What you may not know, but she
had something with your... ex...

83
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,160
ex-spouse, ex-partner.

84
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,400
With Mandelbaum. They had something together.

85
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,680
What?
- Did not you know?

86
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,360
When?

87
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
Did not you know?

88
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,000
I do not know when.

89
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,600
Come on... did she have anything with FranÃ§ois?

90
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Who says that?
- They themselves.

91
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600
When did she say that?
- I do not know...

92
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,200
Two years ago or so.

93
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,960
At least. I do not know anymore.

94
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,960
When I was with him, or after that?

95
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,480
I do not know.
I think for that.

96
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,600
She would have told me that.
impossible.

97
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She said it very casually...

98
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,720
why would she lie?

99
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,240
Is it bothering you?

100
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,960
I have to work with her,
so it bothers me, yes.

101
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,800
Working with her is
a huge opportunity.

102
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,360
You can work internationally through her.
That's fantastic.

103
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
I do not know...

104
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,360
are you really sure?

105
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
Impossible... you are mistaken.

106
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,200
Impossible.

107
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,720
She said it and why would
not I believe her?

108
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
But it is now out.

109
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,800
I do not know...

110
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,480
Perhaps.

111
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,920
I do not get it.
It is strange.

112
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,160
It is almost bizarre if it is true.
Are you really sure?

113
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,560
I should not have told you.

114
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,520
It is no longer important now.

115
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,520
Put that bottle away.
- I will.

116
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,120
Put that bottle away.

117
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,800
Yes sir.

118
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,200
Do you also have gluten-free olives?

119
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,960
Gluten-free olives?
- Do you have that?

120
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
I have to check that out.

121
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,920
And give me a cup of hot water.

122
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,360
Without lemon.

123
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,400
Just boiling hot
water, you know?

124
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,040
Fine.

125
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,400
Why that tone?
He is polite.

126
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,280
Are you falling on him?

127
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,160
Does not seem like anything to you.

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
You are worth a lot more.

129
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,360
You may not know, but...

130
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,000
I admire you.

131
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,480
For real?

132
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Really.

133
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I think you are a remarkable woman.

134
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,000
There is a man in Paris who
even finds you extraordinary.

135
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,920
Simple, I wish I was you.

136
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,120
I would like to be you.

137
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,720
For real

138
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,880
You do not realize that you have the
most beautiful goal you can do.

139
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,760
There is nothing better.

140
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,360
Why? Do not you like your own work?

141
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,720
You never talk about your work.

142
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
Because it is unsatisfactory.

143
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
Banking work is not interesting?

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,200
My work is alienating.
Be glad that you are doing something else.

145
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,480
My fellow bankers...

146
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,520
never read a book, never go out.

147
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,000
Limited lives with boring weekends
in holiday homes with their family.

148
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,640
Uninteresting bourgeois types.

149
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,560
Unlike you.

150
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,400
Do you think that's funny?

151
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,240
What interests you in life?

152
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,000
The pleasures of life.

153
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
The beauties of this world.

154
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
The friendliness of this world.

155
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,320
Touch me.
He's a little excited.

156
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,000
The fabric is happily soft flannel.

157
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,360
I will answer the question
that you do not ask.

158
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,480
I will never leave my wife.

159
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,200
You are enchanting, but
my wife is extraordinary.

160
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,480
Difficult sometimes, exhausting
even, but extraordinary.

161
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,080
But you are very exciting.

162
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,480
If we play this smartly,
we can have a lot of fun.

163
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,920
Very much.

164
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,360
Your hot water.

165
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,560
I have to go through the office.

166
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,400
I feel like walking.
Take my car.

167
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
My driver can drop you anywhere.

168
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,600
Thank you very much.

169
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
Thank you very much.

170
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,000
Have A Nice Day.

171
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,560
Bye.

172
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It just does not work.

173
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,520
To be someone's secret
mistress is impossible.

174
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,680
Am I with him?

175
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,520
Am I with him? Or not?
I do not know.

176
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm tired.

177
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm tired.

178
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,120
Is this my life?

179
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,160
I want to find love.
One true love.

180
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,320
I am emptying a wall.

181
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Why can not it go differently?

182
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,960
Why why why?

183
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,160
I do not get it.

184
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Fantastic that you come
to the gallery with me.

185
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I will take good care of you.

186
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,440
I will do everything possible.

187
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,920
Whatever.
You will see it.

188
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
You're a great artist, you know.

189
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,280
Sorry, but can I ask you something?

190
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,200
Go ahead-

191
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,040
I find it pretty embarrassing, but...

192
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,840
Sorry...

193
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,520
Say it.

194
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,600
Then, if there is
something, say it.

195
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Please?

196
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,840
Go ahead.

197
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,200
Then I say it outright.

198
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,400
Sorry, it's very hard for me.
I find it terribly embarrassing.

199
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,360
Sorry.

200
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,640
Just say it.

201
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,360
Listen...

202
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
This is ridiculous.

203
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,400
It does not concern me either.

204
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,320
If I do not say anything,
the loops will stick to us.

205
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,040
That's just how it is.

206
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,040
Go ahead, say it.

207
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
I have to say...

208
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,240
otherwise it affects our work.

209
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,080
Sorry if I mention something
that does not concern me.

210
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,280
Listen...

211
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,760
I heard someone say...

212
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,280
that you ever had something...

213
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,600
with FranÃ§ois Mandelbaum.

214
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
No not at all.

215
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,720
Who knows in the future?

216
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,600
Weel who told me that?

217
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
Vincent Briot.

218
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,000
The banker?

219
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,200
I get sick of the daily routine.

220
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,960
That's part of the theater.

221
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,960
But that also makes it heavy.

222
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,280
The public on such an evening does not notice anything.

223
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,680
But it makes it heavy night after night.

224
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

225
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,080
Congratulations.
You were fantastic.

226
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,120
I saw it for the second
time and was still moved.

227
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Your interpretation of the role is...
so modern.

228
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,760
And personally, I think.

229
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,480
Thank you.
- I must thank you.

230
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,520
I'll look again.

231
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
He's good, is not he?

232
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
Maybe it is personal.

233
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,240
My own private problem.

234
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
Maybe I'm just tired
of the routine.

235
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,440
The same thing every night.

236
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,920
For personal reasons.

237
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,440
That daily routine
really gets me too much.

238
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,200
Your daily routine?

239
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,080
Yes, my daily routine.

240
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,120
In my life.

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,480
And that means?

242
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,160
In my current life.

243
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
In my current life I suffer
from that daily routine.

244
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,880
You say...

245
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,680
that you do not know what
to do during the day,

246
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,160
that your days are
empty and meaningless?

247
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,880
No, my life from day to
day, at this moment...

248
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
is just...

249
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,440
almost a burden for me.

250
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,120
My wife and I are separating...

251
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
my desire lacks in my life.

252
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,000
Ah, it will come back again.

253
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,960
I can also look for the desire
elsewhere, like the moel.

254
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,240
'Elsewhere? Where?

255
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,960
The unknown.

256
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,080
The unknown?

257
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,880
Does your life annoy you?

258
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,240
No, I never really get bored.

259
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,880
Put me behind the geraniums
and I'm not bored.

260
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,640
I drink a lot, and
that causes oblivion.

261
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,200
Unless I go too far.

262
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,320
Then one word can be too much.

263
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,880
Then I sometimes become somewhat...

264
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,920
violent.

265
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,040
How so?
- Home.

266
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,720
The truth is...

267
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,840
only I know that it
is over with my wife.

268
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,840
I'm leaving her,
but only I know.

269
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,440
I always let everything
escalate, out of cowardice.

270
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,840
I let everything escalate.

271
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,960
I do not dare to say that it is finished.

272
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Afraid of what it
can bring about.

273
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,760
But is it really over?

274
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
I do not know...

275
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,120
I just do not have everything in hand.

276
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,720
And that I meet you here
does not make it any easier.

277
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,880
Are we going to eat?
Are you hungry?

278
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,880
You decide.
Are you hungry? Do you want something to eat?

279
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,640
I like something.

280
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,240
We would go eat anyway?

281
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,200
To discuss our project?

282
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,280
I do not know anymore...
What you bring up now...

283
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,480
so personal, I am suddenly...

284
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,400
of the wise.
I did not expect this.

285
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,400
Me neither.

286
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,280
I just asked...

287
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:43,520
I just asked...

288
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,880
Let's go eat.

289
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,160
To talk.
Was that not the intention?

290
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,480
And we're already being praised.

291
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,520
I just wanted to say that
my private concerns...

292
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,920
not necessarily...

293
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,360
more important than
our meeting here.

294
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,360
All possibilities are
still open, but...

295
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,960
But?

296
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,160
What I want to say...

297
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,080
I suggest to go out for dinner.

298
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,240
With something to drink.

299
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,000
Can I drop you somewhere?

300
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,360
Best

301
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,440
So...

302
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
So...

303
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,480
It's as if we did not say
anything tonight. Nothing.

304
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm tired.

305
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,280
We said something...

306
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,000
and immediately
claimed the opposite.

307
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,440
I am free tomorrow.

308
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,400
We can watch a movie.

309
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,720
I'll call you.

310
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,240
So...

311
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,080
I see you tomorrow.

312
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,720
I'll call you when I wake up.
- I do not know.

313
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,400
I'll call you and we'll see.

314
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,480
I do not know if you should call.

315
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,080
Park a moment, then
we talk about it.

316
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,280
We do not have to
spend hours about it.

317
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
What you want.

318
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,920
Let's not do it.
It leads to nothing.

319
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,240
What are you looking at?

320
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,040
I feel rather rejected, hence.

321
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,280
But you do not understand that.

322
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,480
I really do not understand...

323
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,360
how you can feel rejected.

324
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,840
Serious...

325
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
I do not get that.

326
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,080
You just said 'it
leads to nothing'.

327
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,600
That's what I said, yes.

328
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,240
Do not you understand why?

329
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,360
That's what I said... but you should
not take everything so literally.

330
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,600
Oh no?

331
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,560
All right then.

332
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,320
Well...

333
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
Well... well...

334
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,920
It feels like you
want me to get out.

335
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm not in a hurry.

336
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,840
You do not have to leave me.

337
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,640
Sorry...

338
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,520
but I have the impression...

339
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,640
that you want me to get out.

340
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,920
Not true.

341
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,960
Do you want me to stay? Yes or no?

342
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,920
Stay.

343
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,600
Then come in.

344
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,200
But your daughter is inside.

345
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,200
She's with her father.
The whole week.

346
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,320
I like a drink.

347
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,560
I do not have much.

348
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,280
Nothing really.

349
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,920
Only this.
Is this good?

350
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,000
What do you want me to say?

351
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,000
No idea.

352
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,240
What do I feel like now?

353
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
Say it.

354
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,280
No...

355
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,960
Absolutely not.

356
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,600
Why should I?

357
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,440
No idea.

358
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,040
And what concerns you?

359
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,640
Could you do that?

360
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,160
Can you pronounce them?

361
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,520
Would you know what to say?

362
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,360
Probably.

363
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,520
But I would feel naked.

364
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,640
Reported to...

365
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Shall I go anyway?

366
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,000
That feels good.

367
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,200
Sometimes no words are needed.

368
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,480
What do you want?

369
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,440
Will I stay or go?

370
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,960
Stay.

371
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
I could not stand it anymore.

372
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,840
It feels good not
to talk anymore.

373
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,120
I thought there was no end to it.

374
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,280
Sometimes silence is more pleasant.

375
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,320
Let's just close the door.

376
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,000
Where to?

377
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,440
Do you mean which room?

378
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
Over there?

379
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Come.

380
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,200
Beautiful room, Isabelle.

381
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,960
So I will speak to you tomorrow?

382
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Fantastic...

383
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,480
If we see each other again,
will not we make love?

384
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,200
We did not have to go
to bed with each other.

385
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,720
We should have
listened to music.

386
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,040
This was not love.
Just a whim, no love.

387
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,320
Why did I start my private life?
Boaster? To decorate you?

388
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,080
But this is not love.

389
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,240
I have just returned from Brazil
and I wanted to catch you.

390
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,280
Sometimes I'm weird, is not it?

391
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,960
Can be, but I'm busy.

392
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,600
You are not funny and your
offer is not my goal.

393
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,680
You never said anything like that before.

394
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,200
Did you cry?

395
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,800
I'm tired.

396
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,520
You will not like it,
but I will tell you.

397
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,160
Crying is for little girls.
And sneue people.

398
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,320
Do you know what is happening now?

399
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,840
You open the door,

400
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,400
you leave and you
will never return.

401
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll open it for you myself.

402
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,560
Go away.
- I thought...

403
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,000
Stop thinking.
Never come back.

404
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,960
I decide what happens here!

405
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,080
And everything in bed
was a cheap farce?

406
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,880
You are a bastard!

407
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,000
Look!
Well, we meet again.

408
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,880
I hope everything goes well.

409
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Or better, or at
least good enough.

410
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,200
I thought of two things
since last time.

411
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,960
Two things.

412
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,040
I have two proposals,
both decent.

413
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,200
First, it would be good for me

414
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,440
if we can dine soon,
if it suits you.

415
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,680
Second,

416
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,800
I invite you back to the Lot.

417
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,200
Next weekend, or
the 24th - 25sle.

418
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,480
A wonderful art
festival in the region.

419
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,520
Now that the house has been adequately refurbished,

420
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,600
I have a chambermaid again

421
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,600
so that we do not have to
interfere with the household.

422
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,520
I am there all week, or partly.

423
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
You can stay as
long as you want.

424
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,800
That is really nice...

425
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,360
Mathieu.

426
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
Are you feeling better already?

427
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
Yes, it does.

428
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,800
And you?

429
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,400
Without going into
details, yes, yes...

430
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,360
Fortunately the weather is improving.
You mean a lot to me.

431
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,160
That's sweet.

432
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,040
Think about it for a moment.

433
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,080
Keep me informed!

434
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,680
Do not yellow, you know!

435
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
I promise!

436
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,680
What?

437
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,160
I'm not defeating you.
Bad reception.

438
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,800
I will call you back.

439
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,880
So...

440
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,040
You regret it.

441
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,160
Yes, I regret it.

442
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,680
But meeting you was wonderful.

443
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,720
I have never encountered
such a person.

444
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,720
And that will not happen anymore.

445
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,280
An exciting night and then
the next day regret...

446
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,720
that happens so often.

447
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,760
You're always over that
quickly, but not with you.

448
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,480
I'm sorry it went like this.

449
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,240
This has nothing to do with love.

450
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,840
I would not have
made it that far.

451
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,440
It would have gone badly.
Or not at all.

452
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,760
I felt bad afterwards.

453
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,640
I regretted it.

454
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,680
How did you feel afterwards?

455
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
What did you think?
- Was I happy?

456
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,560
Yes, how did you feel?

457
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,400
I felt good.

458
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,800
Listen...

459
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,680
you had bars and I did not.

460
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,160
AI imagine that it was not 'love'...

461
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,320
you can not pretend that
nothing has happened.

462
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,920
If you are sorry, you are sorry.

463
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,320
But we can not pretend
that nothing has happened.

464
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,280
We can not pretend like
nothing has happened.

465
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Then we'll only stop with it.

466
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,880
I liked it as it was before.

467
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,480
Ready.

468
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,800
It has happened.

469
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,040
Too fast.

470
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,200
I just did not see it coming.

471
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,480
Now we have ruined everything.

472
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,040
Now this has happened, while I found
our earlier Contact more pleasant.

473
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,600
Now that is no longer there.

474
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,640
Now that is no longer there.

475
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
Maybe not.

476
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,240
Maybe we can go back.

477
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,840
Just again.

478
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,320
And what has happened, we forget.

479
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,240
And so there is...

480
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,800
just another new beginning?

481
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,200
Done business do not
take time, right?

482
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,000
So there is still...

483
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,880
a future for us?

484
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,560
No, that's over.

485
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,520
There is no other solution.

486
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,440
Agree.

487
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,440
I thought you wanted to see me again.

488
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,480
I did not think you
would agree with it.

489
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,520
You're crazy. I
told you I agreed.

490
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,240
All right then!

491
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,200
By the way, there are
no other solutions.

492
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,640
I'm going again.

493
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,680
I promised to take a pizza home.

494
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,200
Long live the family.

495
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,560
Can I call you back?

496
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm busy.

497
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,200
When do you call him back?

498
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,080
About a few minutes.

499
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,400
'A couple of minutes?

500
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,200
What are you doing tonight?
"In a few minutes?

501
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,280
There is a play tonight.
But you are prevented.

502
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,480
'In a few minutes'.

503
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,840
I do not know.

504
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,120
Do I have to say anything else?

505
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,520
That's up to you.

506
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,440
To me.

507
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,880
Can I also say anything?
- Best.

508
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,120
How are you?

509
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,200
Good?

510
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,000
How so?

511
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,440
I'm not okay with me,

512
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,080
so I wondered how you're doing.

513
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,440
I do not feel like
kittens and calves.

514
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,160
I really want to talk...

515
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,840
know if you are happy.

516
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,520
It is not easy.

517
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,720
I'm going home.

518
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,200
I'm exhausted.
My day was...

519
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,320
very heavy.

520
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,240
Do you want a bit of music?

521
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Or rather silence?

522
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,160
What do you want?

523
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,560
We can set up some music.

524
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,440
I'll turn on the radio.
That will do us good.

525
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,400
I choose the moment.

526
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,480
I chose a moment every day.

527
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,280
One panel per day?
- Every day.

528
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,600
I think...

529
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,560
I look at the sky and
choose a moment.

530
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,280
Sometimes I only had...

531
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,200
10 minutes, because the
sky changed quickly.

532
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,000
10 minutes, because the
sky changed quickly.

533
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,920
The weather conditions.

534
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,280
I had 40 minutes maximum

535
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,120
with a calmer air that
did not move as fast.

536
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,760
So you did that every day?

537
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,160
It was important that
I did not miss a day.

538
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,800
Good evening, Isabelle.

539
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,600
Good evening, Isabelle.

540
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,240
Would you like to drink something?

541
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,040
Would you like to drink something?

542
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,520
Love.

543
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,600
What?

544
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,840
Perrier, if you can find that.

545
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,840
Good evening, Isabelle.

546
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,760
Isabelle, I'm sad.

547
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,640
Isabelle, I'm sad.

548
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,640
I can not talk.
I'm on the other line.

549
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,200
Can I call you tomorrow?
Are you free with lunch?

550
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:57,680
Can I call you tomorrow?
Are you free with lunch?

551
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,680
I am really sad.

552
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,240
We can not throw this away
as old dishwashing water.

553
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,640
We can not throw this away
as old dishwashing water.

554
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,880
I'll be right back.

555
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,120
With that banker, do you
know what made me cum?

556
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,280
Money?
- No money.

557
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,720
The thought that he was a bastard.

558
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,880
The thought that he was a bastard.

559
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,040
An old bastard.

560
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,720
I thought, "He's a bastard..."

561
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,280
and I finished.

562
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,200
Or I introduced him to a whore.

563
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,760
Or with his wife.

564
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,760
Or with his wife.

565
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,280
Ugly with her lifeless face.

566
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,720
Just a corpse.

567
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,480
Fucking him out of
pity made me cum.

568
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,720
That kind of filthy stuff.

569
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,920
That kind of filthy stuff.

570
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,120
"Tossing bastard" was enough.

571
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,720
At least in the beginning...

572
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,680
I concentrated and thought:
'What an asshole'...

573
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:45,960
I concentrated and thought:
'What an asshole'...

574
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,840
and then I got an orgasm.

575
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,760
I did not need more.
Easy to sit.

576
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,840
Fantasies always contain
an element of truth.

577
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,800
But I swear to you,
Ariane, it worked.

578
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,680
But I swear to you,
Ariane, it worked.

579
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,680
At least at the beginning.
Later...

580
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,960
much less.

581
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,560
I can not even tell
you some things.

582
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:09,840
It was a real bastard.

583
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,080
It was a real bastard.

584
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,920
It became unbearable.

585
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,640
I do not think I can
go on like this.

586
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:27,000
It is as if my love life is behind me.
All over.

587
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,480
It's all over.
There is nothing left.

588
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,760
That's nonsense...

589
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:33,960
That's nonsense...

590
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,800
Are not you in love with your actor?

591
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,520
I do not know.

592
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,880
There is a real problem.

593
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,720
Why did I leave FranÃ§ois?

594
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,720
FranÃ§ois was crazy about you.

595
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,000
You have a child. That counts.

596
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,080
He supported you in your work.
That also counts.

597
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,600
Do you know he called me?

598
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,120
He came along...

599
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,360
Did it go well?

600
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,960
Yes, he stayed overnight.

601
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,240
We had sex.

602
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,800
And it was...

603
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:22,200
And it was...

604
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,560
The next morning, I
thought I was so happy...

605
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:30,840
that I was so lucky that
my life was extraordinary!

606
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,760
The next day I realized
that it was the opposite.

607
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,880
The next day I realized
that it was the opposite.

608
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,720
We saw each other, we spoke...

609
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,960
but we spoke as two
depressed people

610
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,080
who once loved each other, but
could not do that anymore.

611
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,000
Not together, not separated...

612
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,880
They do not want to hurt each other.

613
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,600
They protect each other. They lie.

614
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,080
They play safely, in case
they never find anyone else.

615
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,840
And that is why they
only stay together.

616
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,960
And that is why they
only stay together.

617
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,120
He asked me to go on
holiday with him.

618
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,200
Come to Corsica.

619
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,760
We rented a house there.

620
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,640
I'm going to work this summer.

621
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,840
Besides...

622
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:22,120
Besides...

623
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,160
You let me talk, but you do
not say anything yourself.

624
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,200
As?

625
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,560
How are you?
Gaal it well?

626
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,440
Very well.

627
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,640
It is getting better between Pascal and me.
In every sight.

628
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,440
'In every sight'.

629
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,400
Do you think I do not
know what that means?

630
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,360
Probably.

631
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,240
Probably.

632
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,360
'In every sight'.

633
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,600
Isabelle?

634
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,880
I'm here.

635
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
FranÃ§ois?

636
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,800
What?

637
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,600
What was that?

638
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,680
That is not for you.

639
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,320
It is.

640
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,000
It is not natural.

641
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,680
It does not suit you.

642
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,080
As if you are a voyeur.

643
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,640
Not at all.

644
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,720
As if you are imitating
something you saw somewhere.

645
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,360
That's how it comes to me.

646
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,240
Of course not. Fake.

647
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,360
I want to be alone.

648
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,000
I want to be alone.

649
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,720
Sorry.

650
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,720
I can not do this.

651
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,560
CONTEMPORAINE ART FESTIVAL

652
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,120
Nice huh?

653
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,680
Superb.

654
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,720
Yet? It is beautiful.

655
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,440
The countryside is beautiful.
Look at that house.

656
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,920
The countryside is beautiful.
Look at that house.

657
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,880
True?

658
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,200
True?

659
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,560
My lawyer had a country house here.
Maybe you can see it from here.

660
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:10,440
When we still had our
house in the Gard,

661
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,960
When we still had our
house in the Gard,

662
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,120
my wife and I went to visit.

663
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,400
It is so peaceful here.

664
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,560
You're crazy when you lie
down on a busy beach.

665
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,600
I always love those
hilly landscapes.

666
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,880
We also want to buy something here.

667
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,520
It is also beautiful here.
Bravo!

668
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,720
We, on the other hand,
always enjoy sailing.

669
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,880
We rent a boat,

670
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,160
invite some friends
and we go out.

671
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,680
Then we stay at sea
for a few days.

672
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,080
Or we'll moor in a quiet bay.

673
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,520
Where no one is at all.

674
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,360
Only wild nature.

675
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,960
We have been doing that for years.

676
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,040
How delightful.
- Very pleasant, yes.

677
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,200
Look up there!
a group of wild geese!

678
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,240
They are falling.

679
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,600
What fascinates me is that the
landscape is actually nothing.

680
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,680
Shapes, colors, a sunbeam.

681
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,440
Yet it is part of us
and does us good.

682
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,520
It is completely intact.

683
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,480
Rare, nature that really
looks like 'nature'.

684
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,040
That is why I ask myself something.

685
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,560
Would a 17th-century farmer who
awoke in this environment,

686
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,320
just as captivated by
the beauty as we are?

687
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,640
I thoroughly disagree with it.

688
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,160
By which?
- The question is not right.

689
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,760
Your statement is wrong.

690
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,920
Yes, we know it now!

691
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,840
It is all yours!

692
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,040
Earth, sky, mountains!

693
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,600
Everything, including all knowledge!

694
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,480
No panic, we do not
steal anything.

695
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,200
Even the birds!
They are also yours.

696
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:17,480
They are gone now, but
they are coming back soon!

697
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,720
Do not panic,
everything is yours!

698
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,720
Everything is yours!

699
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,240
Everything!

700
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,600
Are you all right?

701
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,880
Even the landscapes are yours.

702
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,160
Are you still going hiking?

703
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,560
It was freezing cold.

704
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,200
Here he is also freezing cold.

705
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,600
You managed to escape.

706
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,480
I stayed in the hotel bar.

707
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,720
With the journalist from Limoges.

708
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,880
Ah, landscapes in
the countryside...

709
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,600
I like to look at people most.

710
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,840
Are you in love, are you?

711
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,520
If you are not, what do you do?

712
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,760
Then I do nothing.

713
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,840
No sex? Nothing at all?

714
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,200
Nothing.

715
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,440
That must be heavy.

716
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,280
It can sometimes take a long time.

717
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,200
I know.

718
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,240
During such a long break...

719
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,160
do you never do something wild?

720
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,720
Making love is better
when you are in love.

721
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,560
But it's good to
let yourself go,

722
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,280
before you pick up the routine again.

723
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,960
I never let myself go.

724
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,600
It would do you good.

725
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,920
You're not in love, so
get out of your roof,

726
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,520
you meet a waitress,

727
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,720
a scientist,

728
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,360
a dentist, a puppeteer,

729
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,240
or an artist!

730
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,960
I'm going.

731
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,600
I take the train from 07:00.

732
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,800
Are you going too?
- Yes.

733
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,920
He dances well.

734
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,200
I'm sorry if I last hurt you.

735
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,320
I'm going.

736
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:36,560
Listen...

737
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,160
We tried it...

738
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,760
The moment was probably not good.
I want to ask you something.

739
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,480
Can I return the keys?

740
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,800
Unbelievable.

741
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,520
I did not want to keep them.

742
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,440
And you gave them to me yourself.

743
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,400
I know that, FranÃ§ois.

744
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,080
Why do you have to have them?

745
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,880
For someone else?

746
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,760
Have you found the 'true'?

747
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,680
I hope it's a good guy.

748
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,800
I am worried about CÃ©cile.
- How so?

749
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,880
She sometimes tells me something.

750
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,240
For real?

751
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,960
So I refuse...

752
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,680
So I refuse...

753
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,320
I prefer to keep the keys.

754
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,720
Does my daughter not live here too?

755
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,560
And half of this house is mine.

756
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,400
Even more than half.

757
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,760
When CÃ©cile is with me,
she tells us everything.

758
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,000
She says that you cry almost every night.

759
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,560
And she sees you crying.

760
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,760
Is that healthy for a 10-year-old?

761
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:51,720
Your life does not concern
me, but its well-being does.

762
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,280
I keep the keys for certainty.

763
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,440
Give them to me.
- I do not have them with me.

764
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,240
Can you see that man again?

765
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,200
We traveled back
to Paris together.

766
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,240
So yes.
- And?

767
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,720
We came back together and
we are still together.

768
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,760
I'm jealous.
Do you live together?

769
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,800
We know each other for 3 weeks.
We do not live together.

770
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,600
But do you 'go' with each other?

771
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,840
I'm sorry to ask, but why did
he fall in love with you?

772
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,800
No idea. That is not me.

773
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,640
I understand that he fell in love.

774
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,520
But I do not understand the other way around.

775
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,400
How so?
- Come on.

776
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,960
Do you often talk?

777
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,120
Yes.

778
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,480
Much even.

779
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,800
Does he understand how it
works in our profession?

780
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,000
No idea... what does it matter?

781
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,080
Nothing.
Sorry, I do not mean anything with it.

782
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,560
What do you discuss?

783
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,040
Everything.

784
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,200
We just talk.

785
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:34,240
Do you also do things together?
Do you see each other's friends?

786
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,040
Never?
- It's not that far yet.

787
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,640
We're just at home with me.

788
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,160
We walk...

789
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,360
That does not hold.

790
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,360
A couple survives only
within a social environment.

791
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,040
Does he have friends?

792
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,600
Why does not he introduce
you to anyone?

793
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,920
Because he is afraid
that I have no interest?

794
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,840
Perhaps he does not
feel at ease then.

795
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:13,080
Or they feel uncomfortable.

796
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:18,600
Or does he think he is in two camps?
They are two different environments.

797
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,440
Sometimes you do not feel at ease.

798
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,440
I understand what
you have to offer.

799
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,040
Explain.

800
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,560
Why is it clear what
I have to offer?

801
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,680
It is obvious that you give him
an unprecedented legitimacy.

802
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,520
But apart from his
exotic person...

803
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,320
what you have fun with...

804
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,880
and that's nice of course...

805
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:45,040
Have fun with him...

806
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,840
but keep your distance, otherwise
you will certainly get hurt.

807
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,800
He can never offer
you what you need.

808
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,600
Why not?

809
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,440
Trust me.

810
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:02,000
Enjoy it. But he never
met your friends?

811
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,720
We have known each other for just 3 weeks.

812
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,920
Who will know if one of
us wants to continue?

813
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,520
What does he live from? A payment?

814
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,560
No idea. I did not ask.

815
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,920
Take someone from your own environment,
otherwise it will not work.

816
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,480
The old, familiar story.
You always have your own work.

817
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,600
But...

818
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,840
you want more.

819
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,600
You've looked for more.

820
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,440
You want to be happy?

821
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,320
Of course.

822
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,560
What is his name?

823
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,480
Sylvain.

824
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,120
Has he already met your daughter?

825
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,880
Your own environment, believe me.
It does not work...

826
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:01,520
I'm not happy with
those people, Fabrice.

827
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,040
You have a wrong picture of me.

828
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,800
Okay, you're looking for something new.

829
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,200
And I understand him.

830
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,920
But not you.

831
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,960
If you do not believe in it.

832
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:19,480
How can you live with
someone without any belief?

833
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,920
Do not get too involved.

834
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:27,080
I would not bet a cent
on that relationship.

835
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,680
Did he study?
High school?

836
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,640
He finished high school, yes.

837
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,120
You are unbelievable.

838
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,880
To love, I have to
admire someone.

839
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,680
I can be best at a hairdresser

840
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,920
but I'm not going to live with 'r.

841
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,280
I want to go to bed with her.

842
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,120
No more.

843
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,880
See you, thank you.

844
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,320
Beautiful coat. Saves you well.

845
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,480
Sylvain, where are you?

846
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,080
I really want to see you.

847
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,760
I have everything to tell.

848
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,080
Specific questions...

849
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,320
about our relationship.

850
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,040
Why do we never see
your friends together?

851
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,360
Why do we never see
my friends together?

852
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,880
Fabrice says I gave
you more respect.

853
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,880
He said that I should
enjoy you, but not more.

854
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,680
That I had to find someone
from my own 'environment'.

855
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,160
He asked if we saw friends
together and I said 'no'.

856
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,120
He said that this
would not hold.

857
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,640
Then we stop it.

858
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,320
I do not want that.

859
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,640
Then stop that criticism.

860
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,840
That is not very nice.

861
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,520
He is hurting you and now you are hurting me.

862
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,680
Not very smart.

863
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,960
Why aim a smart girl like you?

864
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,440
The truth is that you
are just like them.

865
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,800
I am different.
- Not true!

866
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,480
You are.

867
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,240
Stay with them.
I'll keep it with my friends.

868
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,240
So right?

869
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,800
He was right after all.

870
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,120
What did you answer when he said that?

871
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,640
Nothing.

872
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,080
Nothing?

873
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,560
No, I did not say anything.

874
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,120
Too bad for you.

875
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,560
What could I say?

876
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,080
Something along the lines of...

877
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,200
"Do not crack my beloved."

878
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,400
He said something terrible.

879
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,800
Do not say it.
- It said more about him.

880
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,720
He could go to bed
with a hairdresser...

881
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,840
Who is he? What does he do?

882
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,360
He has a gallery.

883
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,360
a gallery...

884
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,720
So he is smart and
should know better.

885
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,360
See how he upset you.

886
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,200
Look at it anyway.

887
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,960
Why would you deal with them?

888
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,240
Come with me, Isabelle.

889
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,120
Come with me.

890
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,360
I feel good with you.

891
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,720
Me too.
- For real?

892
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,320
Of course.

893
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,480
But I did not know if you...

894
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,840
That's my problem...

895
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,440
nobody knows what I think.

896
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,160
It is nice to hold your hand.

897
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,880
Glad you handed me that.

898
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,320
This is very important to me.

899
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,320
But I have to go.

900
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,480
Before I do something stupid.

901
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,000
Would you like to come in for 5 minutes?

902
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,360
I live nearby. 10 minutes.
Then I put tea.

903
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,160
It is not a good idea.

904
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,320
I do not walk so fast anymore.

905
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,360
Why did you kiss me then?
I do not get it.

906
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,520
You took my hand.

907
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,880
So I kiss you.

908
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,880
So it is courtesy.
- No...

909
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,240
How can you say that?

910
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,880
I do not want to rush anything.

911
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,480
Stay with me. Please...

912
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,440
Please, stay with me a little longer.

913
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,880
Otherwise it means nothing.

914
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,280
I understand your reaction.

915
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,200
But if you put me in front
of the block, I close.

916
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,800
Completely close.

917
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,600
I am going on holiday
with my children.

918
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,480
Then we see each other in a
month, if you're still here.

919
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,040
I like it, our contact.

920
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,400
We're going slowly from here...

921
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,960
to there.

922
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,400
I like it when you
talk like that...

923
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,880
gently, in my ear.

924
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,160
I'm feeling good.

925
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,560
I do not know what to say.

926
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,600
I would like...

927
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,040
And at the same time, no.
I mean, I do not...

928
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,760
Enough.

929
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,440
You're a good man, David.

930
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,240
What does that matter?

931
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,640
It is important.

932
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,200
See you.
- David!

933
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,880
Do we still see each other?

934
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,320
I do not think so.

935
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,120
How could I have been in here?

936
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,880
The only thing you have
to be careful with...

937
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,480
is that you do not get
involved emotionally.

938
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,720
Because you are
vulnerable in that area.

939
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,760
I also get the impression
that you recently...

940
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:43,640
a period of uncertainty.

941
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:46,280
Not an easy period.

942
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:52,640
Nevertheless, I think
that, gradually...

943
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,480
still make steps forward.

944
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,960
That's how I see the current situation.

945
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:04,920
At the same time...

946
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,160
I would just evoke manifestations
of an artistic nature...

947
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,600
full of creativity, et cetera.

948
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,040
You like my synthetic spirit.

949
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,520
As you feel things...

950
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,360
things see...

951
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,280
she analyzes deeply in yourself.

952
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:29,160
We can only watch
how he develops.

953
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,480
Painting is perhaps
very important to you.

954
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,760
At least that's what I feel about.

955
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,200
We will come back to that.

956
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,480
To begin with, I would
like to know...

957
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,200
whether these elements appeal to you...

958
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,000
in general.

959
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,280
That is important to me.

960
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,560
I hope so.

961
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
In which case I keep
investigating things...

962
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,720
in detail.

963
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:11,360
And do I have to respond now?

964
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,120
Indeed.

965
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,520
On what I just heard?
Yet?

966
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:18,080
That's right.

967
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,120
Exactly.

968
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,240
The most obvious, as a rescue...

969
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,000
You were talking about painting.

970
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,120
I am an artist.
That is my life.

971
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,440
That's how it is.

972
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,360
So you're right.

973
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,720
But I...

974
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,920
Honestly, the question is...

975
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,920
It is my emotional relationships...

976
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,200
who remain an obsession for me.

977
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,360
Last year I met
someone who really...

978
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,000
Last year I met
someone who really...

979
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,120
effect on me.

980
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:12,440
I even have photos with me.

981
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,520
I'll look at that.

982
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,120
And then there is also...

983
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,720
someone else that I
want to talk about.

984
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,760
No pictures. He just
popped up in my life.

985
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,560
I would like to know if...

986
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,520
So he is...

987
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,480
the one who came into
my life last year.

988
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,520
Good...

989
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,800
It must not have been easy...

990
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,320
Perhaps even slightly...

991
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,320
disruptive.

992
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,720
But it also gave satisfaction.

993
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,160
But I do not know if it's over.

994
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,200
How old is that other person?

995
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,240
50, but I do not have a picture.

996
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,960
And nothing happened to him.

997
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,320
I do not know...

998
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,920
You must help me,
because I do not know.

999
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,840
This will come back again.

1000
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,800
With a new way of thinking.

1001
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,040
He may see things differently...

1002
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,960
..with a newly
acquired maturity.

1003
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,480
That's how I feel it.

1004
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,560
He will try to make
contact again.

1005
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,640
Problem is that he
can sit on a border.

1006
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,040
He must be careful...

1007
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,760
do not lose themselves...

1008
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:51,240
I think he can bring
satisfaction.

1009
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,280
But you have to be careful
with his mood swings.

1010
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,880
Because that's...

1011
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,080
the impression I get from him.

1012
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,240
Because that can lead to his...

1013
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,240
departure.

1014
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,800
He quickly flees for things.

1015
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,960
It is true, yes...

1016
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,160
You will see him again.

1017
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,040
For real?

1018
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,240
You will see him again.
You get news about him.

1019
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,040
He pops up again.

1020
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,400
He will shine in his profession.

1021
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,840
He will do something
that is not wrong.

1022
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,360
You get news from him.
He wants to see you again.

1023
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:48,760
I suggest you do not close
your door that day.

1024
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,440
Look what he has to say.

1025
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,600
How he behaves.

1026
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,920
Sorry for the expression...

1027
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,880
but will he make
another approach?

1028
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,360
I would say... probably.

1029
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,880
But is he the perfect
person for you?

1030
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,640
No.

1031
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,360
Is he your future...

1032
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,320
who you want to go
through life with?

1033
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,400
I do not think so.

1034
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,240
Something else is coming.

1035
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,040
It will be a lot thicker...

1036
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,200
heavier.

1037
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,040
In fact, too.

1038
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,200
That is what I feel.

1039
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,240
Shall I tell about
that other person?

1040
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:48,160
You will see the person
in the picture again.

1041
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,600
And others will come.

1042
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,200
Others?

1043
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,040
Other people who will
stand on your doorstep.

1044
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:05,080
I wonder if you will
meet someone...

1045
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,880
who is an actor or something.

1046
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,480
You'll notice.

1047
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,200
You attract such people.

1048
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,280
Such people?

1049
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,160
Actors and stuff.

1050
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,320
There is one who will
feel attracted again.

1051
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,520
To begin with, I think
he has dark hair.

1052
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,400
And it will also...

1053
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,080
click.

1054
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,040
Less out of balance than this.

1055
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,840
This is somewhat incoherent.
uncomfortable.

1056
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,680
At a given moment...

1057
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,080
have you ever had enough...

1058
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,960
of that incoherence.

1059
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,720
That's why I say that something new is coming...

1060
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,160
to show you in...

1061
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,000
that your future might be...

1062
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,000
more in that direction
than with him.

1063
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,120
So...

1064
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,040
even if my future is elsewhere...

1065
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,680
with someone else...

1066
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:16,440
Then I will not completely drool him?

1067
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,280
He is not easy.

1068
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,280
He does not just
accept 'friendship'.

1069
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,160
Unless it develops further.

1070
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,280
That remains to be seen.

1071
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,040
So that other...

1072
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,520
Those of 50 years?

1073
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,360
Without toto.

1074
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,120
Do you want to know his name? Marc.

1075
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,600
He works in a museum.

1076
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,600
I met him...

1077
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,800
in a professional context.

1078
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,080
And I...

1079
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,000
That's what I meant.

1080
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,160
You need unusual people.

1081
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,520
Perhaps someone...

1082
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,440
that just a bit more...

1083
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,080
more adventurous...

1084
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,520
and that suddenly comes into your life.

1085
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,080
Or a messenger.

1086
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:14,600
Someone who experiences
things from a certain part.

1087
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,400
An authentic person.

1088
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,480
You need someone like that.

1089
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,480
I feel that you need
an authentic person.

1090
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,200
The one from the museum?

1091
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,800
This is fairly brilliant.

1092
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,400
In what I feel...

1093
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,680
without shortening him...

1094
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,320
he can abuse that.

1095
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,640
Use or abuse.

1096
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,800
And that means?

1097
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,960
I mean his brilliant side.

1098
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:47,600
He can abuse it.

1099
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,680
He is an important man.

1100
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,520
He represents something.

1101
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,200
But be careful...

1102
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,680
I think this man...

1103
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,080
... is in a period
of transition...

1104
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,200
... also emotionally.

1105
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,640
You're there...

1106
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,480
... but you are not a
woman who is used...

1107
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,200
... as a transition element...

1108
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,320
... to help him cross
over to the other shore.

1109
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:17,880
Therefor...

1110
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,800
you have to be careful.

1111
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,200
How?

1112
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,320
Do not let yourself be used.

1113
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,320
Because...

1114
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,200
I get the impression
that he is a man...

1115
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,600
that can be erratic.

1116
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,720
Attractive capricious.

1117
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:38,280
"Tics.

1118
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,120
You fall in love...

1119
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,800
Best...

1120
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,040
but what should I do?

1121
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,680
Fine, but I do not
want to be used.

1122
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,880
I am not just an individual...

1123
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,000
that is used as a
tool or step-up...

1124
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,040
to help someone else further.

1125
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,000
Impossible.

1126
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,320
Because...

1127
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,040
you can not get damaged here.

1128
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,600
Because he pays credit to you...

1129
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,720
he feels fine...

1130
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,640
And then, sorry...

1131
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,760
I am satisfied and what now?

1132
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,600
So those of 50...

1133
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,800
Certainly is not the
love of your life.

1134
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,360
I doubt it.

1135
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:45,680
I think...

1136
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:49,680
that someone else is
the love of your life.

1137
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,640
From now on you do not
close yourself anymore.

1138
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,280
Which is also better.

1139
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,760
You will still...

1140
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,000
other people can meet...

1141
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,160
that open themselves up.

1142
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,640
Be 'open'.

1143
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,480
But...

1144
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,200
By the way, he's going...

1145
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,280
I do not get him drooled?
He is coming back?

1146
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,120
Which does not mean that something
does not happen sooner.

1147
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,840
He is coming back...

1148
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,960
and that 50-year-old
wakes 'hello' at you.

1149
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,440
Let him come.
'Open'.

1150
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,760
Do not let yourself be stifled.

1151
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,360
That does not lead anywhere.

1152
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,880
Live your own life.

1153
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,280
Do not fall into the trap.

1154
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,760
More I do not ask of you.

1155
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:51,240
Because the 50-year-old...

1156
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,320
He is a trap.

1157
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,760
Because he is a chimera.

1158
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:01,040
Show me another picture
when it pops up again.

1159
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,400
We will not waste time...

1160
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,320
and beat two flies
with one stone.

1161
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:12,960
I know I'm right about
that 50-year-old.

1162
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:17,200
I imagine you with better
people than him...

1163
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:21,280
with more charisma,
more depth...

1164
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,800
And you have enough of that.

1165
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,160
You will see that
my actor reappears.

1166
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:32,000
If I were you, I would
not torture myself.

1167
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,560
Focus on the most
important: yourself.

1168
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:42,400
I, my work and my insights.

1169
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,320
I let things happen.

1170
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,640
I do not focus on the rest.

1171
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,680
I try to find a beautiful
sunlight inside.

1172
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,080
That is all I ask of you.

1173
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,200
Good...

1174
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:03,840
so the idea is that
I come back here...

1175
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:06,120
one day...

1176
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,760
if the other person ever comes back.

1177
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,360
Is that it?

1178
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,360
And you...

1179
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:15,880
are "open" in the meantime.

1180
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:17,920
Open.

1181
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:19,520
That is all I ask of you.

1182
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,280
Open.

1183
