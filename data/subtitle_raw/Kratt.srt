1
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,600
Give me work!

2
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Of war and loss you were aware,
Earth tremors from the bloodshed.

3
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,480
Why did you not prepare?

4
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:27,520
Children died without a home
a piece of bread was bought with gold.

5
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,840
Why did you not prepare?

6
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,360
The time of grace is over now
for Jesus came and you were left behind.

7
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Two are sleeping in their bed,
when one awakens the other one is dead.

8
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,480
Why did you not prepare?

9
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Two are walking side by side,
one taken up, one left behind.

10
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,480
Why did you not prepare?

11
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,400
The time of grace is over now,
for Jesus came and you were left behind.

12
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,920
Of war and loss you were aware,
Earth tremors from the bloodshed.

13
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,320
Why did you not prepare?

14
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,480
How many candles should I put?
- I don’t know, just light'em.

15
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,200
Are you sure that’s a good idea?

16
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Of course, it was one of those last minute
offers. Trips like this usually cost a fortune.

17
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Where do you keep the painkillers?

18
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,840
But did the children agree to staying?

19
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,720
They weren’t against it per se.

20
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,280
And in any case this is
about something else.

21
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm talking about
a real childhood.

22
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,320
A childhood like the
one you and I had.

23
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,096
You have no idea how hard it is to keep
them away from their phones in the city.

24
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,480
It’s like they’re under a spell!

25
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,200
“Happy Birthday to You,
Happy Birthday to You,

26
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Happy Birthday, Dear Mom/Helju
Happy Birthday to You!”

27
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,440
and congratulations to Mihkel
for finally quitting his job!

28
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,640
Make a wish!

29
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,840
Country folk are so nice,
I feel good about the kids staying.

30
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,320
There's nothing else we can do.
It's time to man up! Or woman up!

31
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,560
“From flower to flower he flies,
Towards the beehive he strives,

32
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,200
While thundering clouds arise,
Towards the beehive he flies..."

33
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,640
No further than here!

34
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,040
Have you all lost your mind?

35
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,960
This here is an ancestral grove,
a sacred place.

36
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,560
It’s like church, but in the forest.

37
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,720
You wouldn’t go take down
a church, would you?

38
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,640
So fuck off, this is my land!

39
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,960
And second, there’s no point for you
to do this now -

40
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,080
unless you want to break the blades.
We put nails in the tree trunks!

41
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,080
You damned green terrorists!

42
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,320
You're taking away
an honest man’s livelihood.

43
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
Old classmate,
if you want an honest living,

44
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,760
join us at the fire department!

45
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,720
Do you think my bank loan
will take a break, too?

46
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,320
It won’t!

47
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,800
I lose 200 euros every minute!

48
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,720
Do you understand?

49
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,400
200 euros!
Jesus Christ!

50
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,640
Let’s do that header photo now?

51
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,760
Victory!

52
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,160
You don’t know what it’s like
when somebody just takes your phone away.

53
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,840
And if I don’t upload new content
I might as well be dead!

54
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,640
You don’t have to stare
at your phones all the time.

55
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,720
There are so many things to do
in the world.

56
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,800
I doubt there’s anything to do
in the countryside.

57
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,280
The berries need to be picked.

58
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,200
The apples need to be raked.

59
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,840
The firewood needs to be chopped.

60
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,200
These are Grandpa Helmut’s things,
they should be sorted out.

61
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,640
The grass needs to be cut
with this scythe.

62
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,520
I want to cut the grass!
- Go ahead.

63
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,440
What else needs to be done?
- All the grass needs to be cut!

64
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,320
Maybe Mia should do it?

65
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,560
Can we feed the chickens?

66
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,840
Well alright, let’s feed the chickens.

67
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,000
This, my dear children,

68
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,080
is the world’s best fertilizer.

69
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,000
And when you have
the world’s best fertilizer,

70
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,600
then everything else
is the best as well.

71
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,680
You have the world’s best potatoes,
the world’s best carrots,

72
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,760
the best turnips, the best cabbages,
the best crops, the best vegetables,

73
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,560
everything is the best!

74
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,560
What's with the smell?

75
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,880
This fertilizer is chicken shit.

76
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,360
Eww!

77
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,760
Do you want a clothes’ peg
on your nose?

78
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,720
Sorry I don’t like shit!

79
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
I've had enough for one day.

80
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,600
Well of course,
we’ve done so much, haven’t we?

81
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,120
A whole ten minutes worth.

82
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,960
Oh you city kids...

83
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,160
What's with all this work anyway?

84
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,880
Why can’t we just be?

85
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,160
Because people can’t survive
if they don’t eat

86
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,520
and in order to eat,
one must work.

87
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,080
Such are the rules of this world
whether you like it or not.

88
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,720
You're retired,

89
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,160
why don’t you just
get your food from the store

90
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,640
like the old people
who live in the city?

91
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,280
Dear child, I can’t afford that,

92
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,680
because I need to save up.

93
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,080
Why do you need money?

94
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,680
You have chicken shit
and the world’s best of everything.

95
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Roast!

96
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,240
I'm saving up for my funeral.

97
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,120
"A Modern Day Mutiny:
The War on Facebook"

98
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,920
All i need is your signature!
My kids will die of hunger...

99
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,040
But those devils are singing and crying
as if the trees were alive!

100
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,240
The trees are alive.

101
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
What?

102
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,200
What do you want?

103
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm actually on vacation right now.

104
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
A signature

105
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,680
for the cutting permit.

106
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,440
Which cutting permit?

107
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,480
I don’t want my children
to die of hunger.

108
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,520
My harvester...

109
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,720
Thank you!

110
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
Wait!

111
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
Give this to your kids.

112
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,480
You are a good person,
mister governor.

113
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
You get my vote
every single time.

114
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Knock-knock, may we enter?

115
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
He is a wonderful person.

116
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,880
Our parish is very lucky
to have him.

117
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,480
I see you are still beloved.

118
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,560
Not by everyone.

119
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,640
All of these years in power,
one difficult decision after the other.

120
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,280
But has anyone ever
zoomed in on the details?

121
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,360
Has anyone ever noticed all of the
good that I've done for this parish?

122
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,000
Now there’s this stupid Facebook
where every moron can have an opinion.

123
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,960
And I have to report
to these people?

124
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,480
Where has this come to?
Heaven help me!

125
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,680
Calm them down!

126
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
You know how to do it
all too well.

127
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,520
I will not go on Facebook
nor start sharing cat videos!

128
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,600
I have better things to do,
like rest on my vacation.

129
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,680
And that toilet paper
needs to be shut down

130
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,560
or we need to
replace the editor.

131
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,400
Hold your horses!

132
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,120
We have an alliance,

133
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,640
you're in the coalition,
I'm in the opposition,

134
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,960
I pull, you push.

135
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,320
So just handle the situation.
- How?

136
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,760
Just look at this dump!

137
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,160
The ceiling will crumble on
the land management department.

138
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,600
So, all of these boxes
are going to the library.

139
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,120
You do not enter the governor's office
without knocking!

140
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,400
The rest of the offices
have already been cleared.

141
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,560
Go have some coffee!

142
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,000
Out-out-out!

143
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,080
What are you doing?

144
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,280
Where the fuck are you sitting?

145
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,520
This is the governor's chair!

146
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,800
Why can't we just tell them to fuck off like
we did with the council of village elders?

147
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,960
It’s just a lack of Kinderstube.

148
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,560
They’re snowflakes
with no respect for authority.

149
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,840
But authority needs
to be respected!

150
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,720
Why don’t you figure out
what these people want.

151
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,160
Maybe it’s as simple as a playground
for kids or a bicycle road.

152
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,120
Get to the bottom of it!

153
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,760
So pull yourself together!
Authority...

154
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,880
"Donor Day! Give Blood!
Concert to save the sacred forest"

155
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,000
Bologna, a soup bone and chaff bread.

156
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
There you go.
- Thank you!

157
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,720
No need for a receipt.
- I.46.

158
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,400
Oh, I brought exact change.

159
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,280
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

160
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,080
Good bye!
- Let's go.

161
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,360
She did the dab?

162
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,400
He did the tailwhip?

163
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,080
Go on, say hello!

164
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,400
Don’t stay out too long.
Dinner time is soon.

165
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,560
So basically one of my classmates
has more subscribers than I do,

166
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,480
but my videos
have way more likes than hers.

167
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,000
It’s a real bummer that our parents
took off with our phones.

168
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,360
I bet my subscribers
are panicking.

169
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,440
But why do you smell like shit?

170
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,520
Oh... we do, don’t we...

171
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,880
It’s because we helped Grandma
clean the chicken coup.

172
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,040
She has so many chores!

173
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,800
To sum it up,
our summer is ruined.

174
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,280
That sucks. We can’t use our phones either,
Dad just confiscated them.

175
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
He said we have to spend
the rest of the summer outside,

176
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,856
even though he himself
is on his phone all the time.

177
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,680
Is there anything to do here
that doesn’t require the internet?

178
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,000
Well...

179
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,120
This is the crossroad!
We turn right, you go straight.

180
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,400
OK.
- We had to go to dinner!

181
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,240
Oh yeah! Bye!

182
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,560
Hey, I remembered something!

183
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,200
There’s internet in the library
and they have two computers.

184
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,400
One is a bit old and run down,
but we can use it for YouTube.

185
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,080
You know these guys?
- Me? No.

186
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,040
Why are they waving?
- I don’t know. I thought they knew you.

187
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,480
No way.

188
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,560
How long is this going to take?
- I don’t know.

189
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,040
We could have been in
Turkey by now.

190
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,240
Greetings!
- Hello!

191
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,800
How long will all this last?

192
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,720
This is going to last forever,

193
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,480
But the phones are going to be
in the box for a few days.

194
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,360
Why?

195
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,160
In the interest of everything.

196
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,600
Let’s switch them off as well.

197
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,040
Oh fuck, I took
the kids’ phones with me!

198
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,120
But August was born
ten minutes later

199
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,880
and by then
it was August already.

200
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,200
Do you get it? They’re twins,
but they’re born in different months!

201
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,240
So cool!

202
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,160
Help!

203
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,360
What now?

204
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,440
You don’t want it either?

205
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,160
I do want it, I'm starving.

206
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,960
We thank you,
Dear Heavenly Father,

207
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,560
for all you have given us.

208
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Amen!

209
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,400
Does God really exist?

210
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,120
He does, if you believe in Him.

211
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
Dig in!

212
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,200
Grandma!

213
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
Where do you grow your avocados?
I'm vegetarian!

214
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm vegetarian!

215
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,240
What's this?
- Sauerkraut.

216
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,880
Are you sure this is vegetarian?

217
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,080
It's sauerkraut! Full of vitamins!
The best vegetarian food there is.

218
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,080
Smells like
the world’s best fertilizer.

219
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,680
What goes around, comes around.

220
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,640
Roast!
- Roast!

221
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,640
Shall we go and make the beds?
- Let's do it.

222
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,880
You'll regret this!

223
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,080
Kiddies, maybe you can
fit in one bed?

224
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,440
I don’t want to sleep
next to that fartbag!

225
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
This bed is too narrow and in
any case the farting is not my fault!

226
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,960
It's because of the sauerkraut
like Grandma said.

227
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,800
So enjoy!

228
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,960
You remind me of myself
at your age.

229
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,680
I can’t inflate this,
if you keep farting!

230
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,440
And you're just like your father,
when he was little.

231
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,440
I wonder if you inherited
his tickle spot?

232
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,760
Chukupakniki!

233
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,480
Well that’s nice,
they didn’t leave us any money either!

234
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,040
Go to sleep now,
tomorrow’s another day.

235
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,760
Grandma, tell us something.

236
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,760
A fairytale?

237
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,720
Tell us about
when you were little.

238
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,760
When I was little?

239
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:17,640
I'll tell you a story of when I was little
and had no money.

240
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,960
I decided to build myself a Kratt.

241
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,560
To do that I needed to sneak out during
a full moon and go to the manor house

242
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,440
Sorry, what's a Kratt?

243
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,360
Kratt is a creature that you build yourself
and who does all your work for you

244
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
and brings you mounds of gold.

245
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:45,640
I was about your age,
when my grandmother told me a story

246
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,400
that she had heard
from her grandmother.

247
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,120
So that was your
great-great-great-grandmother.

248
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,040
What was the story about?

249
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:05,720
It was about the Count’s missing journal,
which had the instructions for making a Kratt.

250
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:16,040
You see the Count was very interested
in witchcraft and mysticism...

251
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,280
Did you find the notebook, or not?

252
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,560
No, I didn’t find it.

253
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,960
Thanks, cool story!

254
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,240
I found something much better
that night at the manor house.

255
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,040
What did you find?
- Your grandfather!

256
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,520
Mounds of gold...

257
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,600
Hello!

258
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,520
Mia, Kevin — for you!

259
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,800
Hello, aunt Helju! Can Mia and
Kevin go to the library with us?

260
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
To the library?

261
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,240
Our Estonian language teacher said
that we need to read.

262
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,280
It’s raining
and there isn’t much to do, so...

263
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,040
Of course you can go to the library!

264
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,520
So nice!

265
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Would you like some pancakes?

266
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Are they gluten-free?

267
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Gluten-free?

268
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,120
That's how you plan on going?
It's pouring out there.

269
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Damn...

270
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,120
Grandma, do you have trash bags?

271
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,520
Trash bags?

272
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,400
There should be some
under the sink.

273
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,280
"When among the good and the close,
nobody is alone.”

274
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,000
"SAVE THE SACRED FOREST!"

275
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,360
“Nobody is alone!”

276
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,920
"SAVE THE SACRED FOREST!"

277
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,240
“Nobody is alone!”

278
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,560
“Nobody is alone!”

279
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,400
“Nobody is alone,
nobody is alone..."”

280
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,080
Hello!

281
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
What do you want from here?

282
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,640
Did you come to crush
our civic initiative?

283
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,840
No-no...

284
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Just try us!

285
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,640
I came for the blood drive.

286
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,920
I don’t want to crush anyone,
on the contrary,

287
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:54,480
I as governor care a lot. I want to help,
because who are we alone? Nobody!

288
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,456
Our strength as people lies in unity.

289
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,440
Let’s wrap it up
and go set up by the store.

290
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,080
Lembit!

291
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,280
I remember when you were a little kid and used
to play computer games at the manor house.

292
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,560
What happened?
Why are young people so negative?

293
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,680
Show me your petition!

294
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,800
Saving the sacred forest?
That's beautiful!

295
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,320
What a nice idea!
I want to support you.

296
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,760
Has anyone got a pen?

297
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,720
Do you realize
this document will end up on your desk

298
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,760
so that the parish government
would deny the cutting application?

299
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,960
On my desk?

300
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,160
Of course!
Whose desk would it be if not mine?

301
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,360
I sign every document, I sign...

302
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,680
That's why I'm here -

303
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,240
to tell you there’s no need
for protests!

304
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,456
The parish government
is always willing to cooperate,

305
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,920
especially with young people.

306
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,520
The youth is our future!

307
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
No!

308
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,000
I don’t want any more boxes!
Do you understand?

309
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,520
Oh my God!
They’ve moved the whole manor house here!

310
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,080
We'd like to use the Internet,
but can’t find the computers in this mess.

311
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,640
Where the devil
are the computers?

312
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,360
How about reading books?
This is a library, afterall.

313
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,800
Thanks, but no thanks!

314
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,800
That looks like a star!
So it must be from the Soviet times.

315
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
It's in German?

316
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
Oh my God!

317
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,920
These boxes are from the manor!

318
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,400
This is the Count’s journal!

319
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,480
What about it?

320
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,280
Can we take books home?

321
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,920
What kind of a book is that?

322
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,656
It’s a children’s book
about how to make stuff.

323
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,640
Take it, then.
But make sure you bring it back!

324
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,040
Yes!

325
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,440
Do you mean to say that
the parish government

326
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
will not grant a cutting permit
for the sacred forest?

327
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,680
No, of course not!

328
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,360
If you don’t want me to?

329
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,600
No!

330
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,840
The sacred forest is saved!

331
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,720
The sacred forest is saved!
Long live the governor!

332
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,520
Let’s parade around Muusalu!

333
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,320
Let's make a stop by the store
and later on by the parish government!

334
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,000
Stop!
Although our hearts sing with joy

335
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,520
we can't just kidnap someone
and mess up their plans.

336
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,600
What plans?

337
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,520
“Nobody is alone,
nobody is alone...”

338
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,800
Yes, Kalvik?

339
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,800
When you're finished in the manor park,
bring the harvester back.

340
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,400
The hippies lied —
There are no nails!

341
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,840
Let’s cut this
fucking forest down!

342
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,520
What wonderful news! Well done!
Honesty will prevail!

343
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,280
Do you have all your things?

344
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,240
Yep!
- OK!

345
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,520
The kids of today...
Ill have them back in the morning.

346
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,920
Sounds good.

347
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,360
Oh, you darling...

348
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,960
Oh, you darlings...

349
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,080
These are the kids of today!

350
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
OK!

351
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,680
Tuuli has a fear of matches
and Taavi’s pet peeve is a drug raid.

352
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:20,920
No need to be so scared!
The mast is made of solid oak wood.

353
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:37,600
"No need to be so scared!
The mast is made of solid oak wood..."

354
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,840
This is so annoying and it will take
all night or all summer.

355
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,680
Schiissel means bowl.

356
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,600
With Google Translate
we’d already have our Kratt.

357
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,760
But why do we need this Kratt?

358
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,640
And could just focus on being old
and anyway I already told you this.

359
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,320
But maybe Grandma doesn’t want
to just focus on being old?

360
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm older, I'm the teenager,
I decide!

361
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,400
We need Internet!

362
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,880
We don’t hang out online because we're bored
or because we have nothing better to do.

363
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,600
And make us feel good.
That's not why we do it.

364
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:44,400
Even though the happiness hormones
make us giddy, we are not addicted.

365
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
On the contrary,

366
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,240
thanks to technology
we are once again connected

367
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,120
as we were in times of yore

368
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,000
and as nature still is connected
through the mycelium.

369
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Friends!

370
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Nature itself is our guide,
keeping us on the right path.

371
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Long live nature!

372
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,840
Long live Facebook!
Long live cooperation!

373
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,680
The sacred forest has been spared!

374
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,800
The smiley with the sunglasses
and then some flowers.

375
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,880
What do you think?

376
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,800
Good job, Lembit!

377
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,240
Should I post it?
Yeah!

378
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
But why can’t we go online?

379
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,880
Roast!

380
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,480
Because of my gut feeling,
dear son.

381
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,400
You're still little,
but the Internet is big.

382
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,560
It’s full of threats
that I can’t protect you from.

383
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,320
But we need the Internet!

384
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,480
How come kids today just can’t seem to cope
without the Internet?

385
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,160
Why do you need it so badly?

386
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,440
We have a book
and it’s in German

387
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,000
and we would really like to read it,
but don’t know how.

388
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,360
So we thought we might
use Google Translate,

389
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,880
but we don’t have Internet.

390
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,160
It's past your bedtime.

391
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
August!

392
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,480
Calm down!

393
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,760
I majored in German,
in case any of you didn’t know.

394
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,160
For building a Kratt you can use
whatever is handy.

395
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,800
For example...

396
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,520
an oven prong for a spine,

397
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,400
a wheel hub for a belly,

398
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,520
a spindle for the body,

399
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,960
two halves of a wooden bowl
can make up the posterior...

400
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,880
I guess they mean butt.

401
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,040
That's all the stuff
you're gonna take?

402
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,320
Well, this is a surprise!
I really didn’t see it coming.

403
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,080
It belongs to my wife.
She’s in Brussels at the moment.

404
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,960
See you later, kids!
Bye!

405
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
So what are we gonna do now?

406
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,920
Now we're gonna build the Kratt.

407
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,120
A pipe!

408
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Perfect!

409
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,240
Let’s meet here at exactly II o’clock at
night and not a word of this to any parents!

410
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,560
You, Arno...

411
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,440
You are a good boy.

412
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,360
I can tell you one thing.

413
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:03,560
No rascal in this world
wants to be fold the truth.

414
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,280
But lie to them...

415
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,880
Lie!

416
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
Yes.

417
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,000
Then you're the man.

418
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,800
But why do we need the blood?

419
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,160
Because it said so in the book

420
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,320
and anyway it’s just three drops,
stop being such a baby!

421
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,160
Even the doctor
usually takes more than that.

422
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
I'm not a baby!

423
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Wait!

424
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,960
I have a better idea.

425
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,680
Yep!

426
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,096
It’s not the first time
we come here at night.

427
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,160
If we can’t get
online at home...

428
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,920
You punks!

429
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,320
There is someone
behind the window.

430
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,920
Who?
- I don’t know.

431
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,120
But he doesn't look human.

432
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,960
He's all red, eyes blinking.

433
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,600
Churchwarden, who else!

434
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,640
No, it's a...

435
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,720
A ghost!

436
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,640
Help!

437
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,400
You damn rascal,
what the hell are you tooting!

438
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,320
Don't go!

439
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,120
Again with the batteries...

440
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,480
Oh, sweet Jesus,
now he'll get killed!

441
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,680
A-four, a-three a-two, a-one,

442
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,320
an old man leaped over a bomb.

443
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
The bomb it went off
with a bang,

444
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,400
the old man’s pants
in shreds now hang.

445
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,320
A frog peeped out
to breathe some air.

446
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,120
The old man asked:

447
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,000
Who's over there?

448
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,680
Children!

449
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,040
How much more?

450
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,440
Exactly at midnight.

451
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,440
Midnight is at twelve, right?

452
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,000
Yes, but then what?

453
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,200
Well, then we have to whistle

454
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,720
and then Satan should show up

455
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,096
and then we’re gonna
buy a soul from him.

456
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,480
I don’t want to meet Satan!

457
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,440
Come on, it's like shopping.

458
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,040
Just business!

459
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,440
When you buy stuff on eBay, you have
no idea who's really sending it to you.

460
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,920
You might as well
buy it from the Devil.

461
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,320
Children!

462
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,440
Oh dear Lord!

463
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,040
Oh kiddies, what have you done!

464
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,440
Damn it!

465
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,400
Where’s the fuel?

466
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,160
What are you trying to do?

467
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,720
Whistle.

468
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,760
What the fuck do you want?

469
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,280
Fizzy drinks?

470
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,440
“Your Show”

471
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,120
A tear on my cheek,

472
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,800
lips ajar and through them
only your name to be heard.

473
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,440
I think only of you, my angel.

474
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,920
Dreaming only of you,
living only for you.

475
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,600
There is only love on my mind.

476
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,720
I kiss your picture, lying
in front of me, on the table,

477
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,200
and press it against my heart...

478
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,640
You're pretty big already,
maybe you want jobs?

479
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,720
If you have a stable income,
you can get a loan,

480
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,920
buy your own place

481
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,160
and stop living
with your stupid parents.

482
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,040
My boss could get you a really good gig
somewhere far from here.

483
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,520
When we grow up,

484
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,000
we will have self-driving cars
and universal basic income,

485
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,040
so we’re not gonna have to
work at all.

486
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,400
Yep!

487
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,120
In that case,

488
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,360
may I interest you
in some fentanyl?

489
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,720
We'd like to buy a soul.

490
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,520
Gimme!

491
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,560
No-no, scammer!

492
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,840
You're not getting anything
until you give us a soul!

493
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,040
You brat!

494
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,200
You have no idea
how things work!

495
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,480
How can I be sure that the bag
isn’t full of redcurrant juice or ketchup?

496
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,440
Give it to me!

497
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,680
OK, you can smell it.

498
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,440
This is great!

499
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,520
Rhesus negative.

500
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,480
My favourite!

501
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,080
What about the soul?

502
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,640
It’s already there...

503
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,400
What did I tell you -
just like eBay!

504
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,400
So, now our Kratt
should have come to life,

505
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,520
which means we have to keep on
giving it work.

506
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,600
But what if
we can’t keep doing that?

507
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,120
Well, I didn’t really get that part.
Her translation was all over the place.

508
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,760
I told you
we needed to do a proper job.

509
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,360
Someone has used a saw on it!

510
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,120
What are those?

511
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,000
Grandma!

512
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,600
Maybe me and August
should go home now?

513
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,600
You're not going anywhere!

514
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,040
Where do I call?

515
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,960
II2!

516
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,720
Yes, hello, ambulance?

517
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,680
We had an accident with our Granny!

518
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,000
She fell!

519
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,200
Let's start exercising!
Elboes back, hands to the side!

520
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,560
She has a scythe
stuck in her head!

521
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,920
Elboes back, hands to the side!

522
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,040
Touch your toes!

523
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,520
Touch your toes!

524
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,680
Touch your toes!

525
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,440
Does anyone know the address?

526
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,800
Touch your toes one more time!

527
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,080
Have you had enough
of traditional recreation?

528
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,440
Grab a phone and call Muusalu Recreation
Center! Sign up to aju-huasca training!

529
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,040
Ouch, don’t do that!

530
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,560
Muusalu Recreation Center!

531
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,880
Give me work!

532
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,440
Give me work!

533
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,840
Raise your right arm!

534
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,560
Raise your left arm!

535
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,360
Do the dab!

536
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,480
The ambulance will be here soon!

537
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,840
The ambulance!

538
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,000
Oh no!

539
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,440
Hurry!
We have to get rid of the scythe!

540
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,640
No, we shouldn't pull it out, because
that would create internal bleeding.

541
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,720
They taught that at Boy Scouts.

542
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,360
The saw!

543
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,040
Pie?

544
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,760
Salty!

545
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,960
Give me work!

546
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,640
Now we're going to let
the paramedics eat in peace

547
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,720
and then we will send them off,
because you are alright!

548
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,000
Give me work!

549
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,200
Come with me!
First give yourself a round of applause.

550
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,880
Then let’s go into the garden,
because the apples need raking...

551
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,360
I think we should go home now.

552
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,400
The berries need to be picked,
the firewood needs to be chopped...

553
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,560
Kratt is a bad idea!

554
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:32,160
Sure, in the beginning it might make things easier,
but at one point there just isn’t any work left

555
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,400
and then Kratt will break your neck.
Translate!

556
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,280
I don’t know if we should
translate everything.

557
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,840
You don’t want to lie to him, do you? Lies always
find their way back to bite you in the ass.

558
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:56,360
Wait, can’t you just trick a Kratt?

559
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,216
There’s no trick. Some have tried
giving him a task he couldn’t complete,

560
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,400
like making a ladder out of bread
or something, but it doesn’t work.

561
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,400
Bread ladder.

562
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,480
(In German) Bread ladder? What is bread ladder?
- Brot Leiter - bread ladder.

563
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,440
Bread ladder? Kivimae Pets, rest his soul,
had his Kratt make a bread ladder

564
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,920
and his kids used it to climb the barn.
Bread ladder will not stop Kratt.

565
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,480
Maybe we should tell them?

566
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,800
No, stupid, that way
Estonia will never be free.

567
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,960
Let the landlord write down what he is told
and he’ll soon figure it all out for himself.

568
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,920
Yes! That's it! Yes!

569
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,960
"Peace on Facebook"

570
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,280
“I’m done. Went to my Mother's!"

571
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,360
Puss-puss!
Where did the pool go?

572
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,720
I need to rest.

573
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,520
The pool can go fuck itself.

574
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,600
I have to, you have to rest.

575
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,360
I could...

576
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,560
I could go to the beach!

577
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,680
What's that?
- Sorbet!

578
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,680
But where’s Grandma?

579
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,200
Up there painting the house purple.

580
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,080
Where did you get it?
- Grandma brought it.

581
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,600
How exactly?

582
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,200
Give me work!

583
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,320
Let the chickens
out of the coup,

584
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,240
so they can live happily
like us!

585
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,280
What if you don’t give her work?

586
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,440
Then we just have to tell her
to make a ladder out of bread.

587
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,120
She is going to start, but will never finish, because
it’s not possible to make a ladder out of bread.

588
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,000
So it’s a mission impossible and she’ll
keep at it until the processor fries.

589
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,160
I want to call Mommy and Daddy!

590
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,480
Kevin, wait!

591
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,760
I know it’s all a big mess,
but we are going to sort it out.

592
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,360
I promise!

593
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,080
Just eat your ice cream, take it easy
and don’t worry all the time!

594
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:01,760
Evil is real, goodness is real,
The bad are bad and the good are good.

595
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:12,640
Evil is real, goodness is real,
The bad are bad and the good are good.

596
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,440
Wrath is real, meanness is real.
Maybe the bad are the ones who are good?

597
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:25,320
Without good there’d be no evil.
Without evil — no good.

598
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,800
Evil plots would just fall through,
if everyone was only good.

599
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:37,160
Evil is a part of this world.
The same can be said of good.

600
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,600
The law of life is plain and simple -
without evil there’d be no good.

601
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,440
Evil is real, goodness is real,
The bad are bad and the good are good.

602
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:56,440
Wrath is real, meanness is real.
Maybe the bad are the ones who are good?

603
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,200
Hello, Raivo here.

604
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,520
Yeah, I'm on vacation.

605
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,760
A couple of days ago
I signed a cutting permit.

606
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,760
Can you check
which area was it for?

607
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,320
Gotcha.

608
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,040
That's what I thought.

609
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,480
The windows are from when
the school was renovated.

610
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,720
The red bricks are from
the boiler room chimney.

611
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,400
The stairs came from
the social housing project

612
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,481
And the timber I got
from the harbour.

613
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,440
We have no shortage of sand here

614
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:10,920
and there’s always
enough cement to go around.

615
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,840
Look at how many
big projects we’ve done in this parish!

616
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:22,080
You've made them happen!
This here is a monument to you!

617
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,600
Stop worrying
about that sacred forest.

618
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,880
We all knew it was
going to be taken down.

619
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,280
I even won ten euros!

620
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,680
Ten euros...

621
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,680
What ten euros?

622
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,040
I got the boot loose, see?
You can get on your way now.

623
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,176
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
I need to clean up for the big party.

624
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,840
What party?

625
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,120
Where?

626
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,240
In the pizza parlour.

627
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,640
I can’t eat another bite!

628
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,440
What a great day!

629
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,960
We have to go home now.

630
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,920
How about taking some to go?
They’re gluten-free!

631
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,480
Thanks, but no thanks!

632
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,560
OK.

633
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,240
Now can we call Daddy?

634
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,680
No!

635
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,920
The day’s not over yet.

636
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,880
But we don’t know
how to get Granny back.

637
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,280
Let's just sleep on it.

638
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,320
The best ideas usually come
when you're dreaming.

639
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,240
Mia!
- Kevin?

640
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,240
If we don’t come up with anything
by morning, then I'm gonna call Daddy.

641
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,640
Fine.

642
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,760
Don’t make any more pancakes!

643
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,840
Give me work!

644
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,360
Go lie down in bed.

645
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,160
Give me work!

646
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,200
Now pull the blanket up.

647
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,680
Give me work!

648
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,320
And now sleep until tomorrow.

649
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,280
We'll figure out what to do then.

650
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,880
Stop moving, you piece of crap!

651
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,400
Pull over!

652
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,440
Fuck off!

653
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,760
I'm not going in there.

654
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,920
Oh, so I am going?
Gonna put the house in order?

655
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,360
Or should I not go?

656
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,280
Shut up!

657
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,000
Easy come, easy... fuck!

658
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,800
Where is everybody?

659
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,400
They’re on the roof.
The fireworks will start soon.

660
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,360
I'd better wait here.

661
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,720
Two whiskeys, double.

662
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,000
Give me work!

663
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,400
Give me work!

664
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,640
Wrong blood.

665
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,680
That was outstanding!

666
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,160
Much cooler than
the school renovation!

667
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,840
And a lot cheaper!

668
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,000
And that last blast!

669
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,920
Now let’s start drinking!

670
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,000
Is it you?
You're gonna be the new parish governor?

671
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,360
You fucking assholes!

672
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,520
Who wants to get punched first?

673
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,400
I admit the bet was mean.

674
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,360
The sacred forest
was going to have to go anyway

675
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:20,160
to make room
for the gravel quarry.

676
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,360
So I'm just left out of the game?

677
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,520
Such are the rules of the world.

678
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,280
We can’t let anyone else
govern this parish.

679
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,440
People have to believe that there is
a new ruler to replace the old one.

680
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,680
Otherwise
they are going see right through it.

681
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:45,960
And people like us
will be finished.

682
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,560
What are you talking about?

683
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,760
I'm talking about you.

684
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,920
About us!

685
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,160
About holding on to power!

686
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,000
You need to make it simple.

687
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,640
Look here,

688
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,000
Siim

689
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,600
is young.

690
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,680
Young people trust
other young people.

691
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,400
Right when everyone
loses all faith in you

692
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,400
he will swoop in
from the opposition

693
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,360
like a prince on a white horse

694
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,720
to dethrone the lying son of a bitch
who destroyed the sacred forest.

695
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,320
Transfer of power!

696
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,080
Everyone is happy again

697
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,400
and we can keep
building our summer house.

698
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,480
What will I do?

699
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,240
Go back to being a vet.

700
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,280
Or whatever it is that you were doing.
Or retire!

701
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,520
Don’t even think about retiring!

702
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,080
You're going to be
in the opposition.

703
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,840
You sit on your ass
on different boards and councils

704
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,240
and take out benefits!

705
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,040
Fuck, I'm gonna strangle you!

706
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,000
Help me!

707
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,320
Your fucking time
is fucking over!

708
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,080
Don’t get Siim riled up,
he holds a black belt!

709
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:18,320
What the fuck have you done?

710
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,680
What are you doing here?

711
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,400
Give me work!

712
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,920
Helju, I don’t even have
a job myself.

713
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,760
Give me work!

714
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,080
Helju?

715
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,480
Give me work!

716
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,320
Punch Siim in the face!

717
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,280
And make the rest into pizzas!

718
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,480
Which one is Siim?

719
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,520
She’s nowhere to be found.

720
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,680
How do you know this is the right number?
- I got it from the notebook.

721
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,440
Maybe they’re gonna call back.

722
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,560
So what do we do now?

723
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,440
What do we do? What do we do?

724
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,800
Why do I always have to
have all the answers?

725
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,680
Let's tell everything to
August and Juuli’s Dad!

726
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,720
Let me get this straight -
you bought a soul from the booth?

727
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,680
From the Devil.

728
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,280
I'm sorry, from the Devil.

729
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,256
You bought a soul from the Devil

730
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,600
and it went inside Grandma Helju?

731
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,240
Yes.

732
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,160
And now a scythe fell on her head
and she’s missing?

733
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,280
The scythe has been stuck
in her head for days.

734
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,240
The Kratt we built fell on her.

735
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,680
August, did you build
something that fell on Helju?

736
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,400
I made it strong,
I used pillars!

737
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,120
Where are you going?
We want to come with!

738
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,960
You're not going anywhere!

739
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,640
You will stay put
until I return.

740
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,800
Go online or something.

741
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,040
What do we do now?

742
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,120
Let’s ask Vivil

743
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,640
Got something!

744
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,000
Last one...

745
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,600
Why aren’t you working?

746
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,240
Mother, open the door!

747
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,560
I got something!

748
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,400
Are you deaf? I found
something with a fucking reward!

749
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,640
No cursing! God is watching!

750
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:17,160
If your father were alive,
he’d beat the crap out of you.

751
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,080
Do you think I enjoy cooking fentanyl?

752
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,360
Quiet! Calm down!

753
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,840
Settle down now, it’s alright.

754
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,760
We could be completely fucked.

755
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,760
For having a job at all!

756
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,200
Show me what you got!

757
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,160
I'm sure.

758
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,440
No clapping in church!

759
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,040
Helju!

760
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
Helju!

761
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,480
Helju!

762
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,280
Helju!

763
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,080
Children, you don’t joke
about these things!

764
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,040
We’re not joking,
we’re dead serious!

765
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,040
We didn’t have
anyone else to turn to.

766
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:37,000
We could go back to the crossroad, but the
next full moon Thursday is I don’t know when.

767
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,760
No, coming here
was the right thing to do.

768
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:06,880
During my career I've had many brushes with
situations that require a professional approach.

769
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,360
I have used holy water
to cleanse buildings from bad energy,

770
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:16,480
I've consecrated factories
and correctional facilities.

771
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,800
But exorcism

772
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,480
has never been on my plate
until now.

773
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,240
What's inside the box?

774
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,440
DJI Fantom 4.

775
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:55,000
We have to go
and find the old lady.

776
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,080
Taavi, you and your team
go check the swamp,

777
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,080
Madis and Juks
you'll go towards Hansuristi,

778
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,480
Elis and Andro
you take a look in the quarry,

779
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,520
and after that ancestral grove.

780
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,520
If you find something, then...

781
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:29,240
Let's get going!
We're losing light.

782
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,240
“Let the little children come to me.”

783
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,240
The view from above
is very beautiful!

784
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,480
Flying over Estonia
like an angel!

785
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,400
I couldn’t resist the temptation

786
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,200
and bought one
for the congregation.

787
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,600
They don’t cost much
anything nowadays.

788
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:49,000
But what are you
going to do with it?

789
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:55,320
Most of our parishioners
are elderly

790
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,640
and they have
a tendency to get lost.

791
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,856
Some go berrypicking
and can’t find their way back,

792
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,640
others forget where they live.

793
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,160
So I fly my drone
and see where they went.

794
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,600
I have to say
it works really well.

795
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,760
The batteries need charging.

796
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:22,200
Where did you say
your Grandma disappeared?

797
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,440
I think that’s where
we should start.

798
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,840
Give me work!

799
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,520
Give me work!

800
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,480
Give me work!

801
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,960
Give me a cold beer.

802
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,000
I have a splitting headache.

803
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,400
There you go!

804
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,160
Give me work!

805
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,440
Just do whatever it is that you were doing
before you came here, you old witch.

806
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,960
This book doesn’t have
anything useful for anyone!

807
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,920
This hocus-pocus
is a waste of time!

808
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,600
You don’t believe us!

809
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,720
Once I too was young and foolish.

810
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,800
What about Grandma?

811
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:21,160
If she hasn’t returned by morning,
call the police.

812
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:27,000
We should get going.

813
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,000
Why?

814
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,320
Because, first of all,

815
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:38,200
Dad told us to stay home

816
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,000
and second,

817
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:46,720
I feel like if we spend too much time
hanging out with you guys, then...

818
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:51,240
we might end up with
an irreversible childhood trauma.

819
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,760
Yep!

820
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,960
Will we try to call Daddy now?

821
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,880
Have you considered that
he might not want to pick up?

822
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,840
Grandma!

823
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,800
I forgot the drone batteries...

824
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,280
Back down, Satan!

825
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,120
Now we need the Bible,

826
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,840
water

827
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,400
and lots of candles!

828
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,520
You motherfucker!

829
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,160
That damned governor!

830
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,120
Broke my spectacles.

831
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,360
Those are just frames.

832
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,600
They used to have lenses,

833
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,800
but then I got that laser surgery.

834
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,640
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name,

835
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:42,120
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

836
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,440
For ever and ever.
Amen!

837
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:11,920
Hot? Very good!
Hell is hot as well!

838
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,200
Pour it already!

839
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:22,920
Give me work, give me work...

840
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:32,280
God, grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change,

841
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,040
and wisdom to
know the difference.

842
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,560
Pour it!

843
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:59,560
“Nobody is alone!”

844
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:05,440
“Nobody is alone!”

845
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:44,160
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost!

846
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:49,600
Crop failures, famine,
difficult childhood,

847
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:51,680
school shootings,

848
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,760
wars, depression,
drug addiction,

849
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:59,360
rock’n’roll, contemporary art,

850
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:01,000
gay propaganda,

851
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,600
promiscuity!

852
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,600
Sin!

853
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:05,960
Sin!

854
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,400
Sin!

855
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,920
It is time to end it all!

856
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,800
Praise the Lord!

857
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,840
Wait!

858
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,320
Wait!

859
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,520
It's not my fault!

860
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,440
Isn’t it a bit of a cliché

861
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,800
to blame Satan for everything?

862
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:27,000
I only do what I am asked.

863
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,160
Your dualistic world view
is inadequate!

864
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,760
So perhaps some tolerance
is in order, dear shepherd?

865
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:48,080
So you came to film
the burning manor house?

866
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:51,040
Go on, film the whole damn thing!

867
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:54,360
Here’s some helicopter dick for you!

868
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,840
Suck it!

869
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,560
Are you getting this?

870
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:12,200
Nevermind him, let’s just take a new header
photo. It's getting cold, I want to go home.

871
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,440
What header photo?

872
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:20,920
Why do you need those header photos
and memes and Facebook Lives and all that?

873
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,800
What are you trying to do?
Organize a coup through Facebook?

874
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,240
Power is slavery!
You damn bastards!

875
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,680
Do you really think you
can change something?

876
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,000
Make it better?

877
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,880
I've been doing it my whole life

878
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,560
and what's the point?

879
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,600
Sorry, I don’t know what to do either, but
another sacred forest has just been cut down.

880
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,040
We can’t just sit on our asses
and watch the world turn to shit.

881
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,840
There’s always gonna be someone
who doesn’t like something.

882
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,000
Where are you going?

883
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:05,600
I'm just gonna light myself on fire.

884
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:08,440
I'm gonna go burn at a stake.

885
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,280
A horrible end is better
than endless horror.

886
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,520
This is not the end,
everything will go on.

887
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:17,240
If you don’t solve your mess in this life,
you'll just come back to do another round.

888
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,400
Stop dicking around,
jump and we will catch you.

889
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,640
I don’t want to come
back for another round.

890
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,120
You're not going anywhere!
Your time has come!

891
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,800
May Lord have mercy on you!

892
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,520
Have you heard the story of the Count

893
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,000
who got himself killed by Kratt?

894
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,680
No, I haven't.

895
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,840
I heard the story from my Mom.

896
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,320
She had heard it from her Grandmother

897
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:57,800
who had heard it from her Grandmother

898
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:04,160
who is my great-great-great-great...

899
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,080
What was the story?

900
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,840
It's the story of the Count

901
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,280
who sold his soul

902
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,080
to give life to Little Count

903
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,320
who was basically a doll.

904
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:31,040
Now I understand the story
completely differently.

905
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:36,040
That's why I needed to quit my job.

906
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,640
Because if you work,
you're the Kratt

907
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,400
and if you don’t work,
you're the Count.

908
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,760
And if you're the Count

909
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,736
Then the Kratt will come
and wring your neck.

910
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,480
I like stories that have a happy end.

911
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,640
The end...

912
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,600
The end is indeed happy.

913
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,840
What do you think you're doing?
Bring her back to life already!

914
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,760
Back to life?

915
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,920
That I can’t do.

916
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,960
What do you mean?

917
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:38,040
Read from your instructions!

918
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,240
There are no instructions for this,

919
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,240
not even in the Bible.

920
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,160
Man has no power of this.

921
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,280
Only God has the power
to bring someone back to life.

922
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,680
Only He knows the time for us
to enter this world

923
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,480
and the time
we must take our leave.

924
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:01,000
Well, ask Him about it!

925
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,080
He will not reply.

926
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,760
He will, if you believe!

927
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:52,440
I do recall a time in my childhood,

928
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:05,880
A gentle voice I heard as if in dreams.

929
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:16,840
It was more tender than lark’s warble

930
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:28,640
and even softer than a spring breeze.

931
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:40,440
For a long time it tried to win me over

932
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:51,920
and fill my life with happiness and bliss.

933
01:40:53,920 --> 01:41:01,920
My foolish heart resisted
and was stone cold,

934
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:13,720
I did not see the joy that I had missed.

935
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:25,600
Then finally the day dawned when I

936
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:38,360
received the call much clearer than before.

937
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:47,800
And Jesus walked into my heart as freely,

938
01:41:52,000 --> 01:42:00,000
As tears of joy came flowing out of me.

939
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:12,760
This voice is now my guardian and leader

940
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:23,960
I follow on wherever it may go.

941
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:33,680
The brilliant sky above me opens wide,

942
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:45,840
I run to Jesus and stay on his side.

943
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,080
Wow...

944
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,280
Mommy! Daddy!

945
01:43:06,360 --> 01:43:08,400
How have you been?

946
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,680
You know what?
We have been doing great!

947
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,000
You have no idea what happened!
It’s absolutely crazy!

948
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:18,480
Like on the first day Kevin wakes up,
he doesn’t even know where he is.

949
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,720
And then he sees Grandma killing a chicken

950
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,320
and he freaks out and then...

951
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,440
Phones!

952
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:32,120
Here, Kevin!
I have to make an Insta story.

953
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:35,440
We missed you so much!

954
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,400
Welcome back!

955
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,120
Mama!
The place looks so beautiful!

956
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:49,760
If we would have known it’s so pretty here,
we wouldn’t have left Estonia.

957
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,160
Well of course!

958
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,360
I had some time to think...

959
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:55,760
Me too.

960
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,880
You too!

961
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:01,000
I wanted to...

962
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,200
It’s all alright.

963
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,960
Alright!

964
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,200
I'm so glad we were able to talk.
I feel so much better!

965
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,640
We brought you a little something.

966
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,400
It's nothing special,
but there was nothing to buy there.

967
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,720
Well, thank you!
“Don’t worry, be happy!”

968
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,760
Let's have some coffee!
- Yes, let's!

969
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:56,200
Is it alive now?

970
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:57,560
What?

971
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:01,120
Is it alive now?

972
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,520
Yeah-yeah!

973
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,000
Thank you!

974
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,600
Give me work!

975
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,440
Give me work!
