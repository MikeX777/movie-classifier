The pigeons have
returned to the coop.

211
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,633
Why did that samurai
try to kill me?

212
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,500
We're in the lawless times
of [inaudible],, warrior monks.

213

[inaudible] rose and
fought the shogun.

214
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:55,933
The symbol was the same

They killed Many took much land.

216
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,033
In the end, they were destroyed.

217
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,800
I am the last one.

218
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,767
The samurai fear
that I might yet

219
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:13,600
raise an army from the dead.

220
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,733
What do you know
about immortality?

221
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:28,033
There are many things I
could teach you if you are

222
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,233
strong enough and not afraid.

223
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,633
But certain things
cannot be rushed.

224
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,367
You can trust me.

225
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:41,500
No man can be trusted,
else he's not a man.

226
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,333
You have given me
no reason to stay

227
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,133
here and be insulted by you.

228
00:19:46,233 --> 00:20:01,267
[inaudible] You may
not be trustworthy,

229
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,233
but at least you will see.

230
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:10,700
To start, you will address
me as your master, sensei.

231
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,367
Do you understand?

232
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,333
Yes, sensei.

233
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,200
Close your eyes.

234
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:27,367
Being a samurai is choosing
that with the pursuit of that,

235
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:31,167
you will be one
with the Bushido.

236

you will be able to perform

00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,933
to the best of your ability--

238

Can I help you?

241
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,133
Thought you might need this.

242
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,233
What'd you wash
your dog with it?

243
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:26,067
Look, I'm going
to take a walk.

244
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,067
I need to think.

245
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,767
Sure you're not
going flying again?

246
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,200
Just some fresh air.

00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,000
I gotta get some rest.

00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,567
Yeah, good idea.

250
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:04,567
Bye.

251
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,100

I;m not going to
let you kill me.

255
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:56,567
You're the one with the gun.

256
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,100
What the hell are you
doing sneaking around?

257
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,067
What are you doing
sneaking up on me?

258
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:04,467
[sighing] You want to tell
me what is going on here?

259
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,633
Nice sword.

260
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:15,867
Drop it.

261
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:16,800
Drop the gun.

263
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:19,867
Come on.

264
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,433
You just wanted to
blow my brains out.

265
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,700
Look, either they
shoot you or I do.

266
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Which do you prefer?

267
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,533
I don't know.

268
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,467
How's your aim?

269
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,100
Pigeons have flown the coop.

270
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,967
I thought you were
watching the place.

271
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,500
They must be hiding inside.

272
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,333
Wait here.

273
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:13,067

00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,167
This car doesn't work.

- Oh, shit.
- What?

279
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:44,667
I can't drive.

280
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:45,600
(INCREDULOUSLY) What?

281
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,633
I forgot how.

282
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:47,667

What now?

295
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,267
Check that out.

296
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,633
(SARCASTICALLY) My
god, it's a library.

297
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,100
Then I remember that building.

298
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,167
Let's go inside.

299
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,700
What are we doing here?

300
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,233
Why don't you trust me?

301
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,333
Why should You've been
playing games with me.

302
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:15,933
No, I'm telling you, I
don't remember anything.

303
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,067
Only the plane crash.

304
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:25,033
Then you really don't
remember who I am?

305
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm not sure.

306
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,967
It comes back in pieces.

307
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:38,467
You probably bumped
your head in the crash.

308
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,033
You must have amnesia.

309
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,333
It's strange.

310
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,600
I remember this old
Japanese man and

311
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,167
being attacked by a samurai.

312
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,700
Does that make any sense to you?

313
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,300
Not really.

314
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,900
Where do you
fit into all this?

315
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,767
I work with you.

316
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,867
Well actually, I
work for the Agency.

317
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,467
Or, used to.

318
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,367
Uh-huh.

319
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:05,467
Tell me more.

320
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:08,267
You were contracted
by the Agency.

321
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,633
You were supposed to get some
information from that passenger

322
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:11,733
on that plane.

323
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:13,100
This man on the
plane, who is he?

324
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,367
Morgan Rush.

325
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,500
Ah, he's a world known
antiquities dealer.

326
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,467
We've arranged for you to
replace Rush's regular pilot.

327
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,000
Just get him to give
you what we need.

328
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,733
What exactly do you need?

329
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:35,167
Rush has acquired some ancient
Japanese tablets of great value

330
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,467
to a certain interested party.

331
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:40,667
He gave them to a man,
code name The Master.

332
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:41,600
The Master?

333
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,167
Uh-huh.

334
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:46,600
Uh Rush should be able to tell
you where The Master's hiding.

335
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,867
Who's the interested party?

336
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,900
Oh, I'm sure you'll meet him.

337
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,567
I hate it when you're vague.

338
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:55,833
Usually means I;ll be
up to my neck in shit.

339
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:58,300
[chuckling] That's
why you love me.

340
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,167
Oh, you remember Jane
English, don't you?

341
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,700
Yeah, your assistant.

342
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,067
Yes.

343
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,600
She stole a copy of your file.

344
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,633
I think she's trying
to stick it to us.

345
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:12,767
So she knows as much as we do?

346
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:13,767
Uh-huh.

347
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,500
We'll need to get rid of her.

348
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,867
OK.

349
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,167
OK, I'll arrange for a meeting
out at the airfield tonight,

350
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:20,400
then I'll eliminate her.

351
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,300
Urbane?

352
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,533
Urbane?

00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,333
Jesus Christ, you scared me!

355
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,667
I'm sorry.

356
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:38,700
What's wrong?

357
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,633
Urbane!

358
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,067
URBANE: Shh, shh.

00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,067
JANE ENGLISH: [gasping]

360
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,600
I'm not going to kill you.

361
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Oh, I remember now that I'm
supposed to, I'm not a killer.

362
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,800
But you've got to promise
to trust me, all right?

363
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,600
All right?

364
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,600
OK.

365
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,633
I know you betrayed the Agency.

366
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,567
What are you trying
to get out of this?

367
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,900
The tablets Mueller's after
are worth a lot of money.

368
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,800
So you wanted it for yourself?

369
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,200
Yeah, why should that reptile
keep everything for himself?

370
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,667
Aren't you guys
supposed to people

371
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,300
working for the government?

372
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,567
We work for the
highest bidder.

373
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,833
[sighing] Well, now this
whole mission has gone berserk

374
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:55,000
and they want to kill us both.

375
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
We have to find The Master.

376
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
He's our only way out.

377
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,733
What leads have we got?

378
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,933
Freddie Delago.

379
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,933
He's in on this.

380
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:10,100
He'd know where The Master is.

381
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:17,933
Shall we?

382
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:21,333
(SCOFFING) I'm in your hands.

383
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:25,333
Well, I'm the
only one you got.

384
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:28,700
Come on, let's
make a phone call.

385
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,133
[telephone dialing]

386
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:31,300
[telephone ringing]

387
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,833
FREDDIE DELAGO (ON
TELEPHONE): Hello?

388
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:36,133
JANE ENGLISH (ON TELEPHONE):
Freddie, this is Jane English.

389
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,700
Be there on time, Freddie.

390
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,533
(VIA LISTENING DEVICE) He
said he'll meet us tomorrow.

391
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,233
URBANE (VIA LISTENING
DEVICE): Where?

392
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,400
JANE ENGLISH (VIA LISTENING
DEVICE): McGill's Road, 11 AM.

393
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,900
URBANE (VIA LISTENING
DEVICE): Good.

394
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,067
You hungry?

395
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:54,833
They're meeting with
Delago in the morning.

396
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,667
You capture and
eliminate Delago, huh?

397
00:30:57,767 --> 00:30:59,067
That will be no problem.

398
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,833
But you still haven't
told me what's so

399
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:04,133
important about these tablets.

400
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:06,100
They contain
certain information

401
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,633
that's crucial to our future.

402
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,833
And in The Master's hands,
they pose a great threat to us.

403
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:12,733
Oh.

404
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,633
So who is this Master?

405
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,033
A long-time enemy.

406
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:20,200
Just find him.

407
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,433
That's what you're getting paid
for-- not to ask questions.

408
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,800
[telephone ringing]

409
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,000
[crowd noise]

410
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:48,667
[non-english speech]

411
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,333
[inaudible]?

412
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,233
No, thanks.

413
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,533
Have you had many relationships?

414
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,233
What, with women?

415
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:04,567
You obviously have wonderful
relationship with yourself.

416
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,133
I don't remember any.

417
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,767
You asked me out once.

418
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,200
No way.

419
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,567
What do you mean?

420
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,033
How can I be with a woman
who's trying to kill me?

421
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,333
Could turn into
an exciting evening.

422
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:22,633
Was it?

423
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,800
We didn't go.

424
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,200
I said no.

425
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,867
Why?

426
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:29,233
You were so close
with Mueller, I thought

427
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:31,567
you were a jerk like him.

428
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,167
Well, now that you
know what a wonderful guy

429
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:36,333
I am, how about giving
me a second chance?

430
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,267
I'll think about it.

431
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:48,500
Right now, we have
a date with Delago.

432
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,533
He's not here.

433
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:17,500
No.

434
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,467
We'll wait.

435
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:32,100
So, am I different now?

436
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,833
I it was I a bad person?

437
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:35,800
I've known worse.

438
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:42,200
What if I--

439
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,800
what if I don't get
all the old me back?

440
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,400
You're much
better now, anyway.

441
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,600
Really, what if I develop into
this wonderful, compassionate

442
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,067
person, then find
out I have to break

443
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,400
people's necks for a living.

444
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,300
You do.

445
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,800
I think you're overreacting.

446
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,267
Everyone's afraid
of the unknown.

447
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:17,100
Yeah, yeah, but who wants
to be afraid of themselves?

448
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,033
It's him.

449
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,200
Hold on, you can't
go out there alone.

450
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,133
The deal was, I talk to him.

451
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,600
No, you can't do this.

452
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,533
We're partners.

453
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:32,500
Then trust me.

454
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,100
Who's your friend?

455
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,533
My chauffeur.

456
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:50,867
Hey, you said alone.

457
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:52,567
I meant you.

458
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,167
Hey, still don't trust me?

459
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:56,467
No.

460
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,233
Don't forget, can always get
Mueller to finish you off.

461
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,033
Yeah?
You're still a scary old broad.

462
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,800
Shut Freddie.

463
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,800
[engine noise]

464
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
You owe me.

465
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,967
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
don't remind me.

466
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,567
OK, so what do you want?

467
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,067
Where can I find the
guy code named The Master?

468
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,733
(SCOFFING) You don't want
to fuck with the Japanese.

469
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:22,200
So you know who he is?

470
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,467
Yeah.

471
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,067
The guy you want just happens
to be in town right now.

472
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,800
But I figured you knew that.

473
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Must have slept through it.

474
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,600
Stop stalling.

475
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,133
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so come on.

476
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:36,300
Just want to make sure
you're not wired eh?

477
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,267
You're paranoid.

478
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:46,433
Hey, it's what's
kept me alive.

479
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:47,367
[gunfire]

480
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:48,300
Oh!

481
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,200
[gunfire]

482
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,600
Who is he?

483
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,000
(WEAKLY)The Master.

484
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,367
Come on.

485
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,000
What are you going to do
with that thing, deflect

486
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,933
Would you leave him?

487
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:06,833
He's dead.

488
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:08,633
Day

489
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,633
[gunfire]

490
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:23,600
Somebody told
them we'd be here.

491
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,167
You stay here.

492
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,600
[gunfire]

493
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:15,933
Drop the gun.

494
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,500
Drop the gun.

495
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:09,033
- [panting]
- Oh, Urbane.

496
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:12,800
Don't make me do it.

497
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:17,333
[gunfire]

498
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:18,233
Urbane!

499
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,767
Well, get his body on the van.

500
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,267
[mystical music playing]

501
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,200

502
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,200
[shouting]

503
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,333
Where is The Master?

504
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:57,267
Gone.

505
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:58,000
Where?

506
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,400
Away.

507
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,800
Get him!

508
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,767
[grunting]

509
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:04,767

[grunting]

515
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,967
Give it up.

516
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:34,100
[inaudible] [inaudible]!

517
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:44,633
Where is the old man?

518
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:46,967
May he rot in hell.

519
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,100
[grunting]

520
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,033
[shouting]

521
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,933
Kill him!

522
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:04,200
He--he's not human.

523
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,600
He bleeds like any man.

524
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,567
[grunting]

525
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Iko!

526
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,500
God, it works.

527
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,500
I cannot die.

528
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,600
So, you have
discovered my secret?

529
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,233
Or should I say, stole?

530
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,300
The knowledge contained
in these tablets

531
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,767
was not for you or
any other mortal man.

532
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,867
It was to die with me.

533
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,033
You know that.

534
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:17,633
You are no longer
a student of mine.

535
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:25,033
I leave you nothing but your
guilt. Your soul is weak.

536
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:28,267
Time will never
heal you have done.

537
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:35,667
I hope you can survive
eternity with it.

538
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:42,600
Sensei, wait.

539
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,167
Sensei, wait!

540
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,500
I cannot die.

541
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,233
You hungry?

542
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,800
What do you want from me?

543
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,533
I'll do anything you
want if you let me go.

544
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:52,633
Well, we'll have to
see about that, huh?

545
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:57,933
Tell me what Urbane told you.

546
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,500
What exactly do
you want to know?

547
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,767
Tell me what Rush told
Urbane before the crash.

548
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:06,700
Didn't tell him anything.

549
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:10,800
Don't lie to me.

550
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,400
Urbane had a special talent
for, uh, extracting information

551
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,300
from people.

552
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,900
Ha.

553
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,800
Probably his charming nature.

554
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,100
Yeah.

555
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,167
So what did he tell you?

556
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:26,333
Think I'll have
that sandwich now.

557
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,633
Urbane threatened to kill me.

558
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:39,433
I didn't help him.

559
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,267
He had no intentions of turning
Rush's information over to you.

560
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:44,933
I think he was
going to sell them.

561
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:47,700
Not a bad huh?

562
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,867
That explains Urbane's
behavior in the diner.

563
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:54,933
But unfortunately, the
only person who can

564
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:58,267
verify your story was Urbane.

565
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,000
Then I guess you're
going to have to trust me.

566
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,367
You help me, I'll help you.

567
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,200
I need more.

568
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,867
After all, what's to
keep you from killing me

569
00:44:22,967 --> 00:44:25,333
after I tell you?

570
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:26,233
Nothing.

571
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:33,800
I know where The Master is.

572
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,167
You're going to need
me to get to him.

573
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:38,033
I want you to take
me to your boss.

574
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:43,333
I'm taking you to
the tsunami right now.

575
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,533
Is he the interested party?

576
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:47,467
Yes.

577
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,133
[grunt]

578
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:21,300
Well, get her!

579
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:47,567
Why do you insist on playing
these stupid little games,

580
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,567
Jane?

581
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,367
Huh?

582
00:45:52,467 --> 00:45:56,533
Have you forgotten
how nasty I can get?

583
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:14,000
I'd have to see why
[inaudible] like Urbane.

584
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,233
You still hold
the ace, Mueller.

585
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,400
Well, let's see
how well you play.

586
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,633
Get his body to the morgue,
and then get back here.

587
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:37,200
AGENT: Where should
we leave them?

588
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,100
MAN: Oh, anywhere.
Got an ID for them?

589
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,333
AGENT: Only for this one.

590
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:44,233
MAN: OK, John Doe
21 for the other.

591
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:06,767
[gasping] Hi.

592
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,300
[weeping]

593
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,300
Shit.

594
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:36,300
[weeping]

595
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,533
[grunting]

596
00:47:37,633 --> 00:47:41,167
Of course, we'll need
you to verify his identity.

597
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:54,367
[panting]

598
00:47:54,467 --> 00:47:56,033
Merely as a
preliminary detail.

599
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:58,867
We have 20 bodies here now.

600
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:01,433
[weeping]

601
00:48:01,533 --> 00:48:04,600
Let's see, what
was the name again?

602
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,900
Delago, Frederick.

603
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,333
[weeping]

604
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:11,533
I'm not sure what
bag Mr. Delago is in.

605
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,733
I'm sorry.

606
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,167
Seems my assistant
has disappeared.

607
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:22,500
He probably went out for a bite.

608
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,833
[weeping]

609
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:26,800
To eat.

610
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,433
Oh, there, there
now, Mrs. Delago.

611
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:33,400
Why don't we just take a peek
and see if we can't find huh?

612
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,767
[weeping]

613
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:47,567
[humming] Ah, here he is, they
brought him in this morning.

614
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:55,533
[weeping]

615
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,900
That's strange.

616
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,033
[humming]

617
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,400
Uh, that's not him.

618
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,867
Just as I was saying, they
brought him in this morning

619
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:12,800
with Mr. Delago.

620
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,433
Ha, here he is, John Doe 21.

621
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:48,033
[weeping]

622
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:52,000
Freddie, Freddie,
oh, Freddie, why?

623
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,033
Why?
Why, Freddie?

624
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:56,033
Give them some time alone, hm?

625
00:49:56,133 --> 00:50:25,500
[weeping]

626
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,767
[screaming]

627
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:31,700
What happened?

628
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:39,800
Visiting hours are
now over, Mrs. Delago.

629
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,033
If you'll just sign
this verification

630
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:42,967
we'll go look for
your friend, hm?

631
00:50:43,067 --> 00:51:19,600
MRS. DELAGO: [whimpering]

632
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,600
Wanna play?

633
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,600
[grunt]

634
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,567
Gentlemen.

635
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:33,100
Leave me.

636
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,733
Is there something
you want to tell me?

637
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:08,233
Jane English, meet
Takeda Sanarma,

638
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:12,167
owner of Sanarma Enterprise.

639
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:15,200
I will make this Miss English.

640
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,133
I understand you have
something we need.

641
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:21,233
I'd prefer not to have to
force you into volunteering

642
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:24,300
that information, but
your cooperation is

643
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,833
necessary one way or another.

644
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:29,367
One million dollars cash.

645
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:30,767
[chuckling]

646
00:52:30,867 --> 00:52:43,767
[chuckling]

647
00:52:43,867 --> 00:52:58,600
[grunting]

648
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,267
The information in
exchange for your life.

649
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:05,000
Surely that is worth more
than the money to you.

650
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,167
And what's to keep you
from killing me afterwards?

651
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,967
You have my word.

652
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:12,333
My honor.

653
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:14,800
My trust in that
you'll remain silent.

654
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,333
I have no reason to kill you.

655
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:21,867
There are far more important
things at stake here.

656
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:23,433
I'll think about it.

657
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:33,433
[whispering]

658
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:34,700
You have one hour.

659
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:45,667
[door closing]

660
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:14,567
Whoa.

661
00:54:14,667 --> 00:55:26,733
[grunting]

662
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:27,733
[beeping]

663
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:28,733
[whirring]

664
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,833
All right, come out of there.

665
00:56:03,933 --> 00:56:06,800
Come out or I'll shoot.

666
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,033
ROBOT TOY: Hello,
space commander.

667
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:12,433
Take me to your leader.

668
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:20,967
You?

669
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:22,200
At your service.

670
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:58,700
But-- [grunting]
[grunting] [groaning]

671
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,667
I had a dream, Urbane.

672
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:05,667
Urbane?

673
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,233
Urbane, you're alive!

674
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,233
Urbane?

675
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,633
Ow!

676
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,200
What was that for?

677
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,833
Don't be so impulsive.

678
00:57:22,933 --> 00:57:24,367
You seemed to like it.

679
00:57:24,467 --> 00:57:25,733
I did.

680
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,867
That's the problem.

681
00:57:27,967 --> 00:57:29,300
Come on, let's
get out of here.

682
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,800
But the bullets, the blood?

683
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,867
I'll explain later.

684
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:36,167
You were wearing a
bulletproof weren't you?

685
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:38,167
No, he was a bad shot.

686
00:57:38,267 --> 00:57:41,367
Look, I don't want to
get into it right now.

687
00:57:41,467 --> 00:57:43,100
I want to know.

688
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,000
I saw the blood.

689
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,000
He hit you.

690
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,233
No, it was a scratch.

691
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:49,233
Urbane, your rib
cage was hanging out.

692
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,633
Tough genes, I guess.

693
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:54,133
How do you expect
me to trust you if you

694
00:57:54,233 --> 00:57:55,400
won't even tell me the truth?

695
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,567
Oh, god, trust?

696
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:59,300
I was in the van.

697
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,667
I heard you suck up to Mueller.

698
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:01,633
Me?

699
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:02,567
You were dead.

700
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:03,667
What was I supposed to do?

701
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:04,800
He was ready to kill me.

702
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,900
Yeah, and what
were you going to do

703
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,033
when it came time to confess?

704
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:16,100
I would have told
him to kiss my ass.

705
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,400
He probably would have.

706
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:21,700
I'd have thought of something.

707
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,633
Are you going to tell me
why you're still alive?

708
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,167
Yeah.

709
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:42,533
I'm immortal.

710
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,333
Very funny.

711
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:48,233
You expect me to believe that?

712
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,667
How else do you
explain my being here?

713
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,400
Look, see?

714
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,500
Look.

715
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,300
I never jumped out of
Rush's plane, either.

716
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,433
We crashed.

717
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:01,700
He died, I didn't.

718
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,633
I can't.

719
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,133
I was born 350 years ago
in Portsmouth, England.

720
00:59:12,233 --> 00:59:13,600
I worked on a
Spanish trader ship.

721
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,233
We were in Japan, I learned
the secret of immortality

722
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,533
from an old warrior
priest, The Master.

723
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:25,900
That secret is on the tablets
that everyone's after.

724
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,033
[door opening]

725
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:28,200
You expect anybody
to believe that?

726
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:32,467
You're coming with me.

727
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:40,633
[gunfire]

728
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:43,533
Go ahead and shoot me.

729
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:45,867
Shoot me!

730
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:47,033
I already did.

731
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:53,067
[grunting]

732
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:56,000
Oh, god.

733
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,267
Don't die.

734
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,400
[sobbing] Love you.

735
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,333
Really?

736
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,900
I wish you would
make up your mind.

737
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,833
I don't understand.

738
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:17,367
In time, you will.

739
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:19,800
Took me a long time
to accept it also.

740
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:25,100
Just one thing--

741
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,667
will you always be
jumping in front of guns?

742
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:31,267
I will try to avoid it.

743
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:40,200
What now?

744
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,833
Well, we still have
to find The Master.

745
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:43,967
He's our only way to
resolve this mess.

746
01:00:44,067 --> 01:00:45,533
What did Delago tell you?

747
01:00:45,633 --> 01:00:49,400
He knew that The Master was in
He didn't know where he though.

748
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,567
Rush was the only one who knew.

749
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:53,467
If only I could remember.

750
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,000
You have to.

751
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,733
Concentrate.

752
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,967
Look into my eyes, remember the
night you were on the plane.

753
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:09,733
You were with Rush.

754
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,267
You were flying.

755
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,833
I-I can't.

756
01:01:17,933 --> 01:01:18,833
You'd better.

757
01:01:18,933 --> 01:01:19,733
Otherwise--

758
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:20,767
We're fucked.

759
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:21,700
Fly the plane.

760
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,167
Fly the fucking plane!

761
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:25,667
I know you gave the
tablets to The Master.

762
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:26,633
Tell me where he is.

763
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:28,000
Release me first.

764
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,833
We're going down about
a hundred feet per second.

765
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:34,700
I don't have time
to unstrap you.

766
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,633
100, 200, 300.

767
01:01:38,733 --> 01:01:41,567
I'll get you for this.

768
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:43,467
He's at a house.

769
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:44,867
349 Alameda Street.

770
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,233
Thank you.

771
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:49,767
Did the Sanarma
put you up to this?

772
01:01:49,867 --> 01:01:52,733
Oh, shit.

773
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:53,700
[explosion]

774
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:58,033
I remember.

775
01:01:58,133 --> 01:01:59,433
He's in a house--

776
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:01,700
349 Alameda Street.

777
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,267
Let's get out of here.

778
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:08,667
[door closing]

779
01:02:18,733 --> 01:02:19,633
[sirens]

780
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:30,433
[sighing]

781
01:02:30,533 --> 01:02:33,933
You're not really planning
on paying her to talk, are you?

782
01:02:34,033 --> 01:02:35,500
That will not be necessary.

783
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,367
She will talk.

784
01:02:36,467 --> 01:02:37,900
And then we will eliminate her.

785
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,833
Yeah?

786
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:40,133
And then what?

787
01:02:40,233 --> 01:02:44,200
And then we kill The Master.

788
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,933
They've escaped.

789
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:46,933
What do you they?
[bang]

790
01:02:47,033 --> 01:02:47,833
They.

791
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:48,800
There they are.

792
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,633
Urbane, you son of a bitch!

793
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,433
Well, after 'em!

794
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:03,700
That's our car.

795
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,567
That's OK, chief, I
know where they're going.

796
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,300
Well, good.

797
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,067
Good.

798
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:10,933
Call in the troops.

799
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:12,000
We're going hunting.

800
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:15,700
Come on.

801
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:22,400
I don't understand it.

802
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,633
I saw Urbane die.

803
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,200
We've known for a long
time that a white man stole

804
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,300
the Sohi secret of immortality.

805
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,433
Must be him.

806
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:32,333
Sohi?

807
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,833
Who are they?

808
01:03:33,933 --> 01:03:35,000
Warrior monks.

809
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,833
The Master was their leader.

810
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:38,233
Was?

811
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:42,200
Yes, 300 years ago.

812
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,767
Then how will we be
able to kill him now?

813
01:03:58,633 --> 01:04:01,033
I'd like to talk to you
about that scene at the office.

814
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:02,067
We don't have time to talk.

815
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:04,033
Just keep walking.

816
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:06,367
You didn't want to stop.

817
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,100
If I hadn't stopped we'd still
be groping at each other.

818
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,033
I didn't stop?

819
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:11,100
You didn't.

820
01:04:15,367 --> 01:04:20,433
If we had gone through with it--

821
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:28,533
sex, that is-- are
you well, normal?

822
01:04:28,633 --> 01:04:29,867
Why?

823
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:33,867
I mean, you don't have any
strange body parts, do you?

824
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:35,367
Want to check for yourself?

825
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:36,267
No.

826
01:04:43,633 --> 01:04:44,433
Have you had many women?

827
01:04:44,533 --> 01:04:45,367
None.

828
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,100
None of any great importance.

829
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,033
Do you have any children?

830
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:54,800
I don't know.

831
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,833
Never tried.

832
01:04:56,933 --> 01:04:59,233
Maybe I was just lucky.

833
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:02,467
Odds must have been pretty
great for you not to have.

834
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:04,433
Look, I've never shared
my life with anyone before.

835
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,567
You're sure you're
built like a human?

836
01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:14,833
Yeah, I have two eyes,
two hands, two balls

837
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:16,167
if that's what
you're talking about.

838
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,200
I am a normal man with a gift.

839
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,900
It took me about a
hundred years to stop

840
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,500
being paranoid about who I am.

841
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,933
Physically I'm 28 years old,
but I have been around for 350

842
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:36,633
years and I'm still all alone.

843
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,200
Think that's fun?

844
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,733
That's it.

845
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:58,433
You going in?

846
01:05:58,533 --> 01:05:59,333
Yes.

847
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:01,467
You wait here.

848
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:02,367
I'll bring him out.

849
01:06:02,467 --> 01:06:04,300
If anyone comes, you lay low.

850
01:06:41,967 --> 01:06:57,367
[scream]

851
01:06:57,467 --> 01:06:58,300
[grunting]

852
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,867
Where's The Master?
Where is he?

853
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,833
[shouting]

854
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:01,733
Come on.

855
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,233
[grunting]

856
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:15,567
Sensei?

857
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:23,333
Michael Urbane.

858
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,033
I am Takeda Sanarma.

859
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,200
Where's The Master?

860
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,833
I was hoping
you could tell me.

861
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:34,767
Leave it.

862
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,567
We have Miss English.

863
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:44,533
That's impossible.

864
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:45,733
I left her by--

865
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,500
By the ridge.

866
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,467
I know.

867
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:51,167
I've got her.

868
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,700
And now I've got you.

869
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,267
What do you want?

870
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:57,667
A test.

871
01:07:57,767 --> 01:07:59,100
Raise his shirt.

872
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:04,667
The wound is gone.

873
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,433
Hold out his arm.

874
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:29,900
This weapon was was designed
by our space program.

875
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,500
It contains a radioactive alloy
that can destroy anything--

876
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,567
including an immortal.

877
01:08:39,067 --> 01:08:45,200
[grunting]

878
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,133
Stop!

879
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,700
If you value the girl's
life, you will cooperate.

880
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:04,667
[buzzing]

881
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:22,067
[whimpering] [panting]

882
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,233
Stand him up.

883
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,833
Enough of these games.

884
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:33,200
It's time to play for real.

885
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,333
Sanarma will have their revenge.

886
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:39,733
[shouting]

887
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:40,700
[gunfire]

888
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:48,633
[sighing] Ho, ho--

889
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:54,800
[shout] [groaning] [panting]

890
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,700
Catch him!

891
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,400
[wind chimes]

892
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,367
(BREATHILY) Where am I?

893
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:14,767
You're safe.

894
01:10:14,867 --> 01:10:17,167
Lie still.

895
01:10:17,267 --> 01:10:21,533
They told me they
had you prisoner.

896
01:10:21,633 --> 01:10:24,100
[mystical music playing]

897
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,300
Sensei.

898
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,867
You are no student of mine.

899
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:36,667
I betrayed you once.

900
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:39,000
I have come to repay that debt.

901
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,700
Repay me by bringing
these men here?

902
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,867
No, by helping
you out of here.

903
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:50,167
The Sanarma have a weapon--

904
01:10:50,267 --> 01:10:52,233
a weapon that will
kill even you and me.

905
01:10:56,967 --> 01:11:01,733
Somebody lost this war 300
years ago, why fight it again?

906
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:02,833
We have the tablets.

907
01:11:02,933 --> 01:11:03,767
Call the authorities.

908
01:11:03,867 --> 01:11:04,700
We can leave.

909
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,567
There's no reason to die.

910
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:09,067
We fight for honor.

911
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:13,133
As long as the Sanarma
live, the battle goes on.

912
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:15,667
There is only one winner.

913
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:20,933
Sensei.

914
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:21,900
[inaudible].

915
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,233
I have 12 men left.

916
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,200
The Sanarma have us surrounded.

917
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:29,700
We will fight to the
death, but I'm afraid I can

918
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,067
offer you no avenue of escape.

919
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:35,867
Hold them off as
long as possible.

920
01:11:35,967 --> 01:11:38,767
There is something I have to do.

921
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:42,067
I will join you shortly.

922
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:43,600
[speaking japanese]

923
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:49,467
He will be fighting with us.

924
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:54,800
Wait here.

925
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,167
No.

926
01:11:56,267 --> 01:11:57,633
I will come with you.

927
01:11:57,733 --> 01:11:59,067
We'll come with you.

928
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,333
Life used to be simpler.

931
01:12:45,067 --> 01:12:45,933
What?

932
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,500
Come on.

933
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,500
Whoa.

934
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,500

938
01:13:02,533 --> 01:13:05,833
You OK?

OX (ON RADIO): This is Ox.

943
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,000
The north room is all clear.

944
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,100
This place is a fucking maze.

945
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,333
I got two on the run.

946
01:13:34,433 --> 01:13:35,567
There's a hallway leading north.

947
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:36,467
Should I proceed?

948
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:37,633
Over.

949
01:13:37,733 --> 01:13:39,333
Proceed with caution, Ox.

950
01:13:39,433 --> 01:13:41,133
We've lost too many men already.

951
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:42,100
OX (ON RADIO): Roger.

952
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,333
Over and out.

953
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:46,500
Have all outposts on the
perimeter reported yet?

954
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,400
Yes, sir.

955
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:01,867
Urbane, let's just get
the hell out of here.

956
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:03,467
I won't leave him.

957
01:14:03,567 --> 01:14:04,333
Forget The Master.

958
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:05,867
I'm more worried about us.

959
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:08,167
Look, if you're afraid, leave.

960
01:14:08,267 --> 01:14:09,600
I've got a debt to repay.

961
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,533
In case you haven't I'm
not immortal like everyone

962
01:14:12,633 --> 01:14:13,767
else around here.

963
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:16,267
Yeah, well they have a
weapon that'll kill even me.

964
01:14:16,367 --> 01:14:19,033
Look, for the first time,
my life's at stake, too.

965
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:23,767
Let's finish this together.

966
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:27,267
OK.

967

969
01:14:36,633 --> 01:14:38,900
Give it up.

970
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,700
All the Master's men are dead.

971
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,967
You can't stop a Sanarma.

972
01:14:45,067 --> 01:14:47,300
I would rather die on my feet.

973
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,700
[gunfire]

974
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:56,633

976
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,600
Jane?

977
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,567
Jane?

978
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:08,133
Urbane, this way.

979
01:15:13,067 --> 01:15:14,900
These steps will take
you two levels down.

980
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,867
That is where The Master is.

981
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:17,367
Do you understand?

982
01:15:17,467 --> 01:15:18,267
Yes.

983
01:15:18,367 --> 01:15:19,433
And you?

984
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:21,967
I'll hold them off
as long as I can.

985
01:15:22,067 --> 01:15:24,400
Tell Sensei it has been
an honor to serve him.

986
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:31,500
[inaudible] May our
paths cross again.

987

[grunting]

989
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,900
All agents report.

990
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,033
AGENT (ON RADIO): One
and two reporting.

991
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,567
Freeze!

992
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:19,700
Drop the sword.

993
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,200
I said drop it.

994
01:16:24,967 --> 01:16:26,433
He's not listening, Leo.

995
01:16:29,833 --> 01:16:32,600
Snuff him.

996
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,767
Forget it pal.

997
01:16:33,867 --> 01:16:34,700
Nobody's that fast.

998
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,567

[grunting]

1000
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,467
We lost agents one and two.

1001
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:56,767
You stay here.

1002
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:57,667
This way.

1003
01:17:02,067 --> 01:17:03,700
One and two, do you copy?

1004
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:23,433
These tablets will not fall
into the Sanarmas' hands.

1005
01:17:29,933 --> 01:17:32,433
[inaudible] dead.

1006
01:17:32,533 --> 01:17:34,833
So they're mortals.

1007
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:38,267
I have lost again.

1008
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:40,800
We can still escape.

1009
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,800
I owe you that.

1010
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,367
You will die today, my friend.

1011
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:50,533
We can try fight our way out.

1012
01:18:07,667 --> 01:18:09,767
Do you think after
300 years, that Sanarma

1013
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:12,700
will give up if we escape?

1014
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,100
I am tired of running.

1015
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,867
If they haven't given
up, why should we?

1016
01:18:17,967 --> 01:18:21,133
Our time has run out.

1017
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:26,333
We have used the gift, now
it is time to give it back.

1018
01:18:26,433 --> 01:18:31,167
Think of all the things
you have seen and done.

1019
01:18:31,267 --> 01:18:34,167
No one can take
that away from you.

1020
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:37,700
The past is all anyone ever has.

1021
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,000
All the else is transitory.

1022
01:18:44,467 --> 01:18:45,767
A final lesson.

1023
01:18:54,533 --> 01:18:56,233
I wish I could share
my past with you.

1024
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:00,867
I was going to tell Jane, but--

1025
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:02,600
She meant something to huh?

1026
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,600
I would gladly have
become mortal to spend

1027
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:08,467
the rest of my life with her.

1028
01:19:08,567 --> 01:19:09,467
Love is rash.

1029
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:13,733
Damn this waiting.

1030
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:16,633
I say we face them on our feet.

1031
01:19:16,733 --> 01:19:18,600
Not only love rash.

1032
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,867
So are you.

1033
01:19:19,967 --> 01:19:23,333
Patience is a virtue
I can live without.

1034
01:19:28,233 --> 01:19:31,500
There is a passage
out of this room.

1035
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,567
Well, let's go, then.

1036
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:34,967
I have no wish to go.

1037
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:38,233
Well, if you stay,
they're going to kill you.

1038
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,067
I will not let them.

1039
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:44,100
I want to die on my
own, with your help.

1040
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,667
You're crazy.

1041
01:19:45,767 --> 01:19:46,933
Is it?

1042
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:50,667
You yourself said you
wanted to be mortal,

1043
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:52,767
meaning you wish to die.

1044
01:19:52,867 --> 01:19:55,167
I would like that now.

1045
01:19:55,267 --> 01:19:57,367
But there's no blade
that can kill us.

1046
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:58,267
Not a blade--

1047
01:19:58,367 --> 01:20:01,267
a soul-- an immortal soul.

1048
01:20:01,367 --> 01:20:03,467
You remember the samurai, Akira?

1049
01:20:03,567 --> 01:20:04,400
Uh-huh.

1050
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:12,467
I faced his father in single
combat during the final battle.

1051
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:15,667
We were both in
possession of the secret.

1052
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:17,533
We were invincible.

1053
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:20,367
We fought long and hard.

1054
01:20:20,467 --> 01:20:25,800
Finally, he charge,
but I was quicker.

1055
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,100
I cut off his head and he die.

1056
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,400
You want me to
chop your head off?

1057
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,467
- A simple thrust will do.
- I will not.

1058
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:41,900
Help me and you can escape.

1059
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,700
Stay and you die.

1060
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,500
Then I will die.

1061
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,900
Kill me also.

1062
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,333
JANE ENGLISH: Urbane?

1063
01:20:52,433 --> 01:20:53,733
Jane!

1064
01:20:53,833 --> 01:21:00,133
Thank God I found hat

1065
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:02,733
Thank God you're still alive.

1066
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:04,267
That explosion knocked me out.

1067
01:21:04,367 --> 01:21:10,700
I've been running his place
This place is crawling with men.

1068
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,700
I thought you'd gone.

[clearing throat]

1070
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,700
Ah.

1071
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,600
We were just discussing that.

1072
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:25,067
Would you please pat
the statue of Buddha

1073
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:26,800
three times on the head?

1076
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:57,700
Way out?

1077
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,533
- You wait in the tunnel.
- Why?

1078
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:07,433
Just do it.

1079
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:24,767
You have everything you need.

1080
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:31,400
I can't love a woman
and watch her get

1081
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:36,167
old while I stay forever young.

1082
01:22:36,267 --> 01:22:38,233
What was done can be undone.

1083
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,767
The tablets told you how.

1084
01:22:40,867 --> 01:22:45,767
You probably did not read
that far in your haste.

1085
01:22:45,867 --> 01:22:49,600
Kill me and the secret
immortality shall be yours.

1086
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,500
All right.

1087
01:23:09,967 --> 01:23:13,167
There is one thing
you should know.

1088
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:17,567
Once you have become mortal
again, there is no going back.

1089
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,500
One life is all a man needs.

1091
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:52,033
May our paths cross again.

1092
01:23:52,133 --> 01:23:53,567
Call me brother.

1093
01:23:57,033 --> 01:23:58,500
Until then, brother.

1094
01:24:04,467 --> 01:24:05,367
I am ready.

Bring the body.

1098
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,633
We'll burn it outside.

1099
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,700
Is it scary being mortal?

1100
01:25:25,233 --> 01:25:29,200
I never really thought
about it before I met you.

1101
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,767
Everybody dies, Urbane.

1102
01:25:34,967 --> 01:25:38,767
Well, I guess
if we're careful,

1103
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:43,833
we should have about 40
or 50 years left together.

1104
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:45,033
Is that a proposal?
