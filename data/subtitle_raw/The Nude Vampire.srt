1
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:36,530
THE NUDE VAMPIRE

2
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,622
- Do you have an invitation?
- I don't have one.

3
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,249
Then I'm sorry.

4
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,344
Get out.

5
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,350
You were on Ile Saint-Louis tonight.

6
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,563
You mean at your townhouse?
I wanted to see it.

7
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,232
I've told you before
not to meddle in my affairs.

8
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,235
But ....
I am your son.

9
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,157
If you want money, you'll get it.
Women, there's no shortage..

10
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,784
But mind your own business.

11
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,244
I could have been killed last night!

12
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,538
Stay away from my business!

13
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,480
So that's it.

14
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,525
You hold private parties on Ile Saint-Louis,

15
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,861
you kidnap a girl,
and no one says anything.

16
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,365
I've had enough.

17
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,870
I'm going to find out what my father
and his two partners are up to.

18
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,005
- Very good, Solange.
- Thank you, Mr. Radamante.

19
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,051
One more thing, Solange
please, tell my son

20
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,138
I won't be home for supper.
I have business to attend to.

21
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,682
- And serve us some drinks.
- Right away, Mr. Radamante.

22
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,068
Everything is fine.
I follow his every step

23
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,447
Don't worry, he won't see me.

24
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,033
Everywhere he goes I'll be there,
in the shadows.

25
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,482
And so the show -

26
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,527
We didn't come for that.
What's going on?

27
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,863
Are the premises suitable?

28
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,240
I hope you know what you're doing,
Radamante.

29
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,786
- All this is costing a fortune.
- Not to mention the risks.

30
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,623
Everything is as I like.

31
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,676
You must leave quickly.

32
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,391
You'll find your father at his office.

33
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,395
Go there at once.
Other mysteries await you.

34
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,313
Is that you, Pierre?

35
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,982
I am very busy.

36
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,777
What? Animal men?

37
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,574
A young girl?
What are you talking about?

38
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,663
You want me to come down in the car
in the middle of the night?

39
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:33,169
You're in danger? Okay, I'm coming.

40
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,796
Where are you?

41
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:41,928
Drive you to your father's office?
Okay. Wait for me.

42
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,606
There was a spy at the townhouse.

43
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,068
- Who was that?
- Do not know. He escaped.

44
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,487
We must clear the townhouse
and bring her here.

45
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,698
Leave it to me.
She'll be here before dawn.

46
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,824
What is this?

47
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,868
Blood analyses
with names and occupations.

48
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:59,834
Night watchman, bouncer-
they all work at night.

49
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,963
There are hundreds of them.

50
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:13,180
The blood, the night -
And why photos of the girl on the wall?

51
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,935
She could be a robot. That explains
why the bullet didn't kill her

52
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,897
She put her hand on my face.
I touched her. She's not a robot.

53
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,142
Sir!

54
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,354
Sir, they have just caught two men.

55
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,899
They showed their faces -
in front of her.

56
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:50,027
- What? Did she see them?
- Yes

57
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,988
One of them is your son.

58
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,116
What's this, Radamante?
Does your son know about it?

59
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:58,869
My son does not know.

60
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:02,206
So why is he here
in the middle of the night?

61
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,959
Bring my son right away.

62
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,341
Don't forget,
I have the most to lose here.

63
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,301
- But -
- No buts.

64
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:18,556
The only way out of this is to give
part of the solution to my son

65
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:27,022
Who is that girl?
How did she survive those bullets?

66
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:30,651
Who are those lunatics
who kill themselves in the townhouse?

67
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,654
What are you doing here?

68
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,991
Why do they put hoods on
when the girl goes by?

69
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:43,664
Since you ask specific questions,
I'll give you straight answers.

70
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,378
Firstly, that girl is my protégé.

71
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,173
She's an orphan.
lam all she has

72
00:34:55,552 --> 00:35:00,097
Secondly, it suffers from a
unknown blood condition.

73
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,892
Any wounds she has heal right away

74
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,186
as long as her vital organs
aren't injured.

75
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:14,820
Thirdly, in the eyes of some fanatics,
she is a goddess.

76
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:22,453
I was happy for this suicide sect,
which worships her,

77
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,371
to use my townhouse.

78
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,998
That's it.

79
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,837
We are looking for someone with
the same blood type as her,

80
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,757
and therefore the same disease,
to try to cure it.

81
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,760
We look at people who live at night',

82
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,472
because those with her con condition
can't tolerate sunlight

83
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:47,811
The hoods are to hide
their faces from" her.

84
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,064
She has never seen
another human being.

85
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,067
She mustn't know she is different.
She would suffer too much.

86
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,235
Satisfied?

87
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,906
- No.
- What do you mean by "no"?

88
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:05,204
You're an accomplice to murder
at your townhouse. Why?

89
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,832
Do you know who is your prisoner?

90
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,584
Enough.

91
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,087
We're not detaining her,
we're protecting her

92
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,131
from those who want her
for motives less noble than ours.

93
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,717
What are your motives?

94
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,762
We are scientists, researchers.

95
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:29,103
Listen, Pierre.
I'll let you go, you and your friend.

96
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,523
Give me 48 hours to justify myself.

97
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,901
Come back tomorrow
and you'll find out everything.

98
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,444
Very good.

99
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,782
Robert will accept the extension.

100
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,411
Forty-eight hours.

101
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,623
Beyond that,
I don't promise anything.

102
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:16,418
My dear friend,
we must hush this up.

103
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,673
Otherwise we both risk
being compromised.

104
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,390
The corpses that have been found
near my townhouse -

105
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,274
My name mustn't be -

106
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,236
Your name?

107
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,582
Understood, my friend. Understood.

108
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,170
I'll see you very soon.

109
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,430
Mr. Gray, is that you?
It's Radamante.

110
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:15,060
Sell everything, even at a low price
the townhouse on lle Saint-Louis,

111
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,813
office building, everything.
That's an order.

112
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,439
What do you have for sale?

113
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:25,279
I need something discreet, isolated,
something outside of Paris.

114
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:31,451
I must be able to move in today.
ls the chateau furnished?

115
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,871
How far is it from Paris?

116
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,873
Sixty miles? Perfect.

117
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,786
We leave in an hour.

118
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:18,081
Lock the girl in the van
so no sunlight can penetrate.

119
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:20,417
Get the bags ready.
You're coming with me.

120
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,004
Notify my associates to join us here
with two armed drivers.

121
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,623
- We'll be safe here.
- But what are you afraid of?

122
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:03,418
It was I who found the girl.
There are others of her species.

123
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,795
Someone is coming.

124
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:22,604
Mr. Radamante, I can't accompany you,
but the doors are open.

125
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:27,401
The chateau belongs to you now.
Treat it with respect.

126
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,030
- But -
- He leaves just like that!

127
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:34,157
We don't even know
where the rooms are.

128
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:37,411
It's not important. Come along.

129
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,046
This will suit me nicely.

130
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:27,229
Solange will join us tonight.
My son stayed in Paris.

131
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,772
As for his friend Robert -

132
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,775
Oh yeah, what about him?
He knows too much.

133
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,529
You needn't worry.
In a few minutes, he'll be gone.

134
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,614
Who will do the job?

135
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,201
Who else are you going to involve?

136
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:48,041
Solange. At this very moment,
she should be with him.

137
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:54,214
But my son mustn't know of it.
Robert was his friend.

138
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,729
To what do I owe the pleasure?

139
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,442
- I came to ask for help.
- Ask me?

140
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:15,902
Yes.

141
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,908
I want to leave Radamante.

142
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,495
He's going to commit more crimes.

143
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,877
That girl is a vampire.

144
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,297
She feeds on human blood.

145
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,969
Radamante wants
her power of immortality.

146
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:46,141
For that, he needs someone
with her type of blood,

147
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:50,478
another vampire
with whom to mate her.

148
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,647
But tell me,

149
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,443
What are you doing?

150
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:04,242
They organized that suicide cult
who kill themselves to feed her

151
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:09,372
We do not know yet how the vampires
recognize each other.

152
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,958
They research,

153
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,461
analyze,

154
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,796
study.

155
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,758
They must be stopped!

156
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,196
Where is everybody? Have they fled?

157
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,325
His father and his associates
have left Paris.

158
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,288
I have stayed behind
to pass on his orders to you.

159
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:37,252
Where's your friend?

160
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,879
Robert is at home.

161
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,924
He wants nothing more
to do with my father.

162
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,219
Forty-eight hours from now,
will call the police.

163
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:51,266
Unless, that is,
my father proves he is innocent.

164
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,104
I want that girl.

165
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,690
I want to know her secret.

166
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:22,816
- Voringe. Voringe!
- What is that?

167
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,276
It's me, Fredor.

168
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,072
Can you hear it?

169
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,992
- The drum? Of course I can.
- What is it?

170
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:36,871
- Where is Radamante?
- Come on, we'll find him.

171
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,213
What is it? it's you.

172
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,299
- Can you hear it?
- Must be the drivers.

173
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:52,679
Drivers? Playing the drums
in the middle of the night?

174
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,868
Wake up to the drivers.
Make sure they are armed.

175
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,837
Both are dead.

176
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,808
That's the signal.

177
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,976
She is free.

178
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:12,832
- Pierre, you've arrived in time.
- Don't touch her. What's going on?

179
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,544
They are going to attack us.
They tried to kidnap the girl.

180
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,629
I'd like to believe you.

181
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,548
Close the doors.

182
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,717
She mustn't see the daylight.

183
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,678
We must prepare for a siege.

184
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,807
We'll discuss later.

185
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,692
- Well?
- Pierre has arrived at the chateau.

186
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,903
They have shut themselves
in the library.

187
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,572
The young girl is in their hands again.

188
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,618
We won't attack tonight.
It'll be daylight soon.

189
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:53,706
We must free her. I don't want to
take the risk of fighting until then.

190
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,958
I'm waiting for an explanation.

191
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:59,045
The problem is simple.

192
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:03,424
We need to find a way to feed her.

193
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,593
I want to know the whole story.

194
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:14,894
This girl has a great power:
immortality.

195
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,147
Those who only feed on blood

196
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:22,401
and can not tolerate sunlight
have this power.

197
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,570
- Like vampires?
- Yeah, like vampires.

198
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,490
We have been trying to find out ...

199
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:32,036
how such a physiological marvel
could exist.

200
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,207
But we had to leave Paris
especially since you and your friend.

201
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,293
I understand. You want her powers.

202
00:55:57,646 --> 00:56:01,065
But Pierre, think about it.
Immortality!

203
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,318
At what price?

204
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,284
You tortured her in your laboratories,

205
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,412
you subjected her
to your experiments,

206
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,456
you terrorized her
with your strange guardians.

207
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:23,337
- You kept others from her view.
- Until today.

208
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,841
Thanks to you,
she has seen our faces now.

209
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,845
- Who are your enemies?
- Other monsters, no doubt.

210
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:35,016
Monsters?
I thought you were protecting her.

211
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:48,821
All right, I want to see these monsters.

212
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,595
Who are you looking for?

213
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,474
Your friend was killed tonight.

214
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,351
Your friend was killed tonight.

215
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,520
But, how?

216
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,731
He was killed
on the orders of your father.

217
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,900
On the orders of my father?

218
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,616
I have seen this sign before.

219
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:19,036
The woman who saved my life
at the townhouse

220
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:22,456
by killing one of the animal men
wore the same sign.

221
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:29,547
You, too, will carry the sign one day
like us, like her.

222
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,258
The girl?

223
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:36,137
She is one of us.
You also are one of us.

224
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,139
Don't you know that yet?

225
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,057
Who are you?

226
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:44,020
On the grounds you will find someone
with the answers to your questions.

227
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:06,042
Who are you?
What are you doing?

228
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,670
- I was meditating.
- Why?

229
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:13,758
Because within these walls,
there are innocents locked up.

230
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,094
And a crime will be committed soon.

231
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:19,263
- A crime?
- Yes

232
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,641
Are you a priest?

233
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,311
Not
I am not a priest of any religion,

234
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,731
although I celebrate a cult

235
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,566
because those who will be killed ...

236
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,402
have protected the life
of someone who is mine.

237
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,987
- The girl?
- Yes.

238
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,114
She is mine too.

239
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:42,286
Is it possible to keep her alive
without any more sacrifices?

240
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,581
Yes, I can. You can.

241
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,084
They shot at her, and she's alive.

242
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,087
Who is she?

243
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,507
I'm the one who knows.

244
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,217
You're one of us.

245
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,473
What you have seen tonight,
what you will see, is not real.

246
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,811
Your father and his associates
believe in vampires.

247
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:08,854
So they will see vampires.

248
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:13,692
But before dawn,
the mysteries will become clear,

249
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:16,112
and evil will be punished.

250
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:21,033
As for you,
let me be your guide.

251
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:25,454
Look at me. And you will know
the one who you are destined for.

252
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,459
Now let me.

253
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:37,007
Before the last crime is committed,
I must meditate again.

254
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,381
You have betrayed me, you little pests.

255
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,343
I have always despised you.

256
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:25,848
But now, there will be
no more obstacles

257
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,143
between me and Radamante.

258
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,895
Pierre took these risks.
But where is Solange?

259
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,022
Ah, Solange. Well?

260
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,025
Robert is dead.

261
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,907
- Two traitors have also paid more.
- Who?

262
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,286
Your two loyal little puppies,
Mr. Radamante.

263
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:32,790
They told her son everything.

264
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,334
I fear he is against us.

265
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,191
Shoot, Solange, shoot.

266
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:12,746
Quick, we must escape.

267
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,666
We are powerless against them.
We can not harm them.

268
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,766
I'll give the signal to attack.

269
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,396
Take care of her.
Don't let her get near the fighting.

270
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,940
Let's go.

271
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,407
Please take it.

272
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:46,038
So... you're not vampires?

273
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,081
Who are you?

274
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,550
Let them go!.

275
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,806
They have lost and they know it.

276
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,354
You must return to the chateau.

277
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,649
You must go and see your father
and his associates.

278
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,360
Afterwards, you will be one of us.

279
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:25,113
But how will I find you?

280
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,074
Await guidance, you'll find us.

281
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:42,440
Pierre, listen to me.
I will guide you.

282
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,944
The time has come for you
to gain the knowledge

283
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,079
Here's another one.

284
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:23,291
I'm so happy.
He is so young.

285
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,168
Come, come.

286
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,003
I have come.

287
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:31,675
We know.
You always end up coming here.

288
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:33,510
We guide you here.

289
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:41,559
We await your arrival, with
the same joy, for over 50 years.

290
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:47,899
In a moment,
you will go through those curtains.

291
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:50,735
This is just an antechamber.

292
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,780
We will never meet again.

293
01:14:57,451 --> 01:15:00,120
Let us look at you a little longer.

294
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,289
They are gone so quickly.

295
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,877
Is it true? You don't know yet?

296
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:10,755
You don't know who you are?
Who we all are?

297
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,426
I know you. You are the one
destined for the young girl.

298
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,844
The girl?

299
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,474
- Where is it?
- Do not be impatient.

300
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,103
The time has come for you to know.

301
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:30,233
Here, take this ring ...

302
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:32,569
and go through the curtains.

303
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,516
So,

304
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,645
now our waking commences.

305
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:12,734
Sometimes two come, sometimes three.

306
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,445
Sometimes none at all.

307
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,823
We just have to wait.

308
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,393
He went in there.

309
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,770
We must follow it.

310
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,732
- I think it's too dangerous.
- You can not count on us.

311
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,360
Okay, I'll go alone.

312
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:03,261
Do you understand this?

313
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:07,849
No. I think she was a vampire
Radamante kept prisoner for 20 years.

314
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,685
- But was she a vampire in the end?
- I don't know.

315
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,645
The experiments were inconclusive.

316
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:17,609
That's true. All my capital went into
that townhouse and the office block

317
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,444
The only thing they found out

318
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,780
was that the girl's blood
belongs to an unknown type.

319
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,867
It's a bit limited to conclude
that she was a vampire.

320
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,536
She was perhaps no more
a vampire than you or I.

321
01:18:28,621 --> 01:18:31,789
- You forget all those immortals.
- Well, these things happen.

322
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:34,792
Radamante must have thought
when kidnapping her

323
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,045
that one day
her family would look for her.

324
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,423
If Pierre hadn't interfered,
the vampires wouldn't have found us.

325
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:44,719
Oh, him! Fallen in love
with a vampire. Can you believe it?

326
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,304
But is she a vampire?

327
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:51,351
She is something. In any case, vampire
or werewolf, we are ruined.

328
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:57,523
- What will happen to Radamante?
- Too bad for him.

329
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:03,404
Anyway, now that they have managed
to lure him to the chateau,

330
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,782
there is little chance of seeing him alive.

331
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,951
He is not immortal.

332
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,289
- Where is my son?
- Careful, this man is not -

333
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:25,254
It will not work.

334
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:27,423
We are not in the same dimension.

335
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,551
In reality,
you haven't left the chateau.

336
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:34,514
- Where is the vampire?
- You are the real vampire.

337
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:41,145
You made her accustomed to drinking blood.
You kept her from sunlight.

338
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:47,193
Look.

339
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,765
For the first time,
she sees sunlight.

340
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,144
She is one of us, like Pierre

341
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:24,480
We are not vampires.

342
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:32,780
One day, the human race will be
like this young girl, your son and I.

343
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:37,869
All will have the power
of immortality.

344
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,730
We are the prototype of future man.

345
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:50,983
The first mutation
of the human race,

346
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:53,236
announcing tomorrow's race.

347
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,031
Vampires never have existed,
but there are mutants.

348
01:23:57,449 --> 01:24:00,952
You will all disappear.
You are powerless against us.

349
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,704
You are powerless against evolution.

350
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:27,562
Tomorrow, today,

351
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:29,605
at any time,

352
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,883
the day of the mutants may arrive.
