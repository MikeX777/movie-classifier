1
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,804
- Is that the island of Haleakaloha?
- Yep.

2
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,558
- We ain't stopping, huh?
- Nope.

3
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:44,438
When I signed on, you promised
we'd be at Haleakaloha by the seventh.

4
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,358
Well, this is the seventh.

5
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:54,322
What do you know?
Me, Boats Gilhooley,

6
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:59,453
six hitches in Uncle Sam's navy
and here I get shanghaied, huh?

7
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,872
Imagine what they'll say at Pearl.

8
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:06,835
Yeah, when this news gets to Diego,
that'll be a little bit funny, I'll bet.

9
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,757
Yeah. Well, good thing I got
a sense of humour, huh?

10
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,390
Permission to leave the ship.

11
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,606
Man overboard!

12
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,119
Hey, I'll bring you before the mast!

13
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,582
I'll throw you in the brig,
you little mutineer!

14
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,008
Daddy!

15
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,100
Hi, Dad!

16
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,811
Dad!

17
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,358
- Hi, Pops! I caught a fish.
- Hi, Dad! Me, too.

18
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,693
- Sit down in the boat.
- Ho, ho.

19
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,738
Sister Angélique,
Sister Mary Margaret.

20
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,615
- Doc.
- Sailor.

21
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:23,078
Sister Angélique, would you accept
some nice fish from a sinner?

22
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,341
- Was that good or bad?
- Very good, Michael.

23
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,593
Thank you.

24
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,308
Get back in that boat, you little pirate.
Ready to take off, Doc?

25
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,937
- A few calls first.
- How long will you be gone?

26
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:52,315
A week, maybe two. Never know
what'll happen on the outer islands.

27
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,693
Look in on the kids occasionally.

28
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,489
Don't I always?
All right, Sam. Shove off.

29
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,047
To the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

30
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,676
From the Governor of Haleakaloha,
French Polynesia.

31
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,511
Subject:

32
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,016
Transfer.

33
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,143
My dear cousin,

34
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:32,439
Once again I appeal to you to be
rescued from this wretched island.

35
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,735
If you could see me living under
the most primitive conditions.

36
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,612
The food is deplorable.

37
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:48,329
The heat unbearable,
and the plumbing...

38
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,501
...huh,
the plumbing defies description.

39
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,632
How can one bathe
when there's no hot water?

40
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,679
Let's see, where was I?

41
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,806
Hot water, sir.

42
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:13,188
In conclusion, my dear cousin,
I respectfully request transfer to...

43
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:17,567
- Miami Beach?
- Splendid! Miami Beach.

44
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:22,113
Or possibly Hollywood, California.

45
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,201
Signed, Marquis
André de Lage, Baron de Fienna,

46
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:31,956
Officier de la Légion d'Honneur,
Chevalier de Marche, so forth and so on.

47
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,474
Here we go.

48
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,649
<i>- Uncle Andy!
- Mahalo Sam.</i>

49
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,278
- Hi, Uncle Andy!
- Hi, Uncle Andy!

50
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,782
Hello, André.
How's the coffee holding out?

51
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,284
Right over there, help yourself.

52
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,288
- How was the fishing?
- I caught one...

53
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,125
- Luki!
- ...that big.

54
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:24,676
And to you, my dear Guns,
a very, very happy birthday.

55
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,304
- Birthday?
- You spoiled our surprise.

56
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,808
- And I baked a cake!
- With 100 candles.

57
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:37,105
- With 150!
- Oh, thanks, thanks.

58
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,696
Birthday! It's a real surprise.

59
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,409
I'll tell you what we'll do.

60
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:54,872
We'll have a nice quiet party tonight
and a big batch of lemon...

61
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,502
...ade.

62
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,467
- Gilhooley?
- Gilhooley.

63
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,539
Uncle Guns, please don't fight.
Don't spoil our party.

64
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,169
- You stay out of this.
- Go on, knock his block off!

65
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,715
I'll knock both of your blocks off.
Come on, you're going home.

66
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,385
Goodbye, Uncle Andy. Thanks.

67
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:59,789
Gilhooley! Gilhooley!

68
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,545
<i>Come on, girls! Come on!
Aloha!</i>

69
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,216
Oh, you lovely, lovely ladies!

70
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:20,101
Ah, the police. Well,
if it ain't my old pal Beau Geste.

71
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:25,731
- Your passport, Gilhooley.
- Naturally, and two bucks landing fee?

72
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:42,415
Hi, Padre. How's the roof
on the chapel holding up?

73
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,794
Gilhooley!
His first word and I am disarmed.

74
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:51,173
I have come to demand your
deportation, and you ask about the roof.

75
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,594
Why not? I paid for it, didn't I?

76
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,600
He gave the dough away, as usual.
And the chapel still leaks, as usual.

77
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,395
Even more, as usual.
But what could I do?

78
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:09,358
The hurricane had swept Rorangi.
There was great need.

79
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,529
But what is a roof against starvation?

80
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,034
Stop! Stop it!

81
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,870
<i>Allez!
To the chapel with me.</i>

82
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,875
Now, wait, Padre. You wouldn't want
me to catch a cold in a leaky chapel.

83
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:03,287
- Uncle Guns, you promised.
- Everything'll be all right, I swear.

84
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,665
Take the kids and practise the piano.

85
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,753
Get a good thick frosting on that cake.

86
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,843
Luki! Sally!

87
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,396
Donovan!

88
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,982
Guns!

89
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,194
- Where is he?
- Gone fishing.

90
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:40,449
- Hey, you got a new mirror!
- I figured it up once.

91
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:46,330
Counting all the broken mirrors, you
and Donovan got 63 years of bad luck.

92
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,379
Hey, that's mine.

93
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,894
It's busted.

94
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,124
That's still busted.

95
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,335
Come on.

96
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,843
- Where's Donovan keep his clothes?
- Same place.

97
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:52,354
Why not? The lug owes me one.
It's my birthday.

98
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,525
Pick out a nice black one.

99
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,155
One you could be buried in.

100
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,444
Tommy!

101
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,573
Fleur! Oh, baby!

102
00:13:56,377 --> 00:14:00,547
Gangway, gangway. Come on.
Yeah, I know, Gilhooley.

103
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:12,601
Tommy,
you've come back to marry me.

104
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,062
You're the love of my life,

105
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:19,608
the only dame that meant anything
to me, but I already said...

106
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,653
...I got a wife in Hoboken.

107
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,406
And San Pedro and San Diego
and Norfolk, Virginia.

108
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:31,328
- You want me on a bigamy charge?
- Pardon me, Fleur.

109
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,832
Gilhooley, no trouble.

110
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,754
Happy birthday.

111
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,060
Happy birthday. My suit!

112
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,773
You want me to look like a bum?
I'm your guest.

113
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:05,028
22 years, huh, Boats? Great.

114
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,281
Pals, huh?

115
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,535
No fights.

116
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,329
Now, Guns, no fights?

117
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:19,626
22 years. Tradition. Legion.

118
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,670
- Legend.
- And the crowd?

119
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:31,013
Hey, Monk... Why don't you throw
that guy in the brig, in the hoosegow?

120
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:34,725
- I'm off duty.
- You're always off duty!

121
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,316
- Not the brandy, you dope!
- Sorry.

122
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:47,362
Watch his left, Tiger, watch his left!

123
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,080
Oh, no!

124
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:08,675
- Tommy!
- Oh, shut up!

125
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,945
They went that way.

126
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,787
Doctor!

127
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,124
Come on, knock it off, you two.
As you were.

128
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:48,256
You're worse than a couple of kids. As
you were. You're at attention, Gilhooley.

129
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:51,885
Now, what started this?
Being born on the same day?

130
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,762
Permission to speak.

131
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,680
What started it was

132
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,601
he pushed a hootchy-kootchy dancer
off on me in Panama.

133
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,729
Gilhooley!
Well, what's wrong with that?

134
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,983
Nothing, except a marriage licence
and a wedding ring went with it.

135
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,527
- Maybelle.
- What?

136
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,863
Pearl Harbor, sir. Dame named
Maybelle. M-A-Y-B-E-L-L-E.

137
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,826
- I never knew any Maybelle.
- Right, her name wasn't Maybelle.

138
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,702
That's enough!

139
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,955
It's obvious neither of you remembers

140
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,541
what started this ridiculous
annual birthday brawl.

141
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:27,003
- It'll come to me, sir.
- I'm sure. Get out of there!

142
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,673
- Cindy Lou?
- Betty.

143
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:41,059
Oh, sugar pie!

144
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:49,484
Here we are, the three of us, on one
of the most beautiful islands on Earth.

145
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,613
It's the birthday of two men
I'm proud to call my friends.

146
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,700
We've been through war together.
Bad and bloody days.

147
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:02,205
Now let's put an end to this fight.
Fleur, break out the beers.

148
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:18,763
All right, now shake hands.

149
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,772
Yeah, the Doc's a great guy.

150
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,777
Happy birthday to you.

151
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:35,572
Happy birthday!

152
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,869
- Tommy!
- Happy birthday to you both.

153
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,234
Continue.

154
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:16,237
When there's dirt to be done,
you hire me.

155
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:18,406
If it's some simple honest matter,

156
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:21,493
you hire Pennyfeather,
Pennyfeather and Pennyfeather.

157
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,832
The fact of the matter is, with
the death of your great-aunt Priscilla,

158
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,543
this fellow out in the South Seas,

159
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,672
Doctor William Dedham,
your father, Miss Dedham...

160
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:38,343
I have never met my father. His
name is not mentioned in the family.

161
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,012
Be that as it may,

162
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,308
unless you can keep him from
inheriting this additional stock,

163
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,354
you'll find yourself mentioning
his name, and quite often,

164
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,400
'cause he'll be the big he-bull
in your shipping company.

165
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:58,321
I hope you ladies don't find
my language too colourful.

166
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,659
There's a clause in the will,
it's in many of these Boston wills,

167
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,830
although civilised people don't put
such drivel in wills any more.

168
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:11,543
It says if anyone can prove that
the heir is not of good moral character,

169
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,798
according to Boston standards,
he may be deprived of his inheritance.

170
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:22,178
Now, if this Doctor Dedham has been
living on some South Sea island

171
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:24,681
with those native girls,

172
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:30,019
the man has probably behaved
in a way that wouldn't suit Boston.

173
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:36,609
If you can prove that, you can cheat
him out of his stock and his money.

174
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:40,113
Anyone object
to me using the word "cheat"?

175
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,244
We are waiting.

176
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,165
That is all.
You'll have my bill in the morning.

177
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:57,922
<i>- Bon voyage, Miss Dedham.
- Comments?</i>

178
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:06,723
- Great-uncle Sedley?
- No comment. With reservations.

179
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:12,061
Be pleased to take over.

180
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,322
Gentlemen, you may go in now.

181
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:43,259
"Miss Amelia Dedham, daughter
of Doctor Dedham, is arriving ETA..."

182
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:46,471
- Estimated time of arrival.
- Thank you.

183
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,808
<i>"...ETA 14.00.
Signed Captain Martin, ship Araner."</i>

184
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,770
There it is, gentlemen.

185
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:58,441
This is for you, the citizens of the
US, to decide. It is not my pigeon.

186
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,487
The question is, does this Miss
Dedham know about her father?

187
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,113
You mean the kids?

188
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,617
- Let her find out.
- So you agree she doesn't?

189
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,036
I can't see
Doc Dedham hiding them

190
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,121
like they were
something to be ashamed of.

191
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:15,750
I don't know.
If I was in the Doc's shoes...

192
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,378
This dame's from Boston, remember?

193
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:22,715
Meeting a father she's never seen,
and being confronted by three children.

194
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:27,053
- His children by some native woman.
- We know who she was!

195
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,474
My dear Michael, of course, Manulani.
We all loved her.

196
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:36,479
But how can this girl help
reaching all the wrong conclusions?

197
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:42,360
I got an idea. You know how I am
with broads. So I invite her up here.

198
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,905
- Then what?
- I slip her a Mickey.

199
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:51,160
I have the solution!
Gentlemen, I shall explain on the way.

200
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:57,041
- On the way where?
- To the house of Doctor Dedham.

201
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,586
Well, you know these wily Chinese.

202
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:06,092
- Well, you're a big...!
- Shipmate!

203
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:16,936
Polonaise!

204
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:31,367
- Hi, Uncle Guns.
- Hi, Uncle Guns.

205
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:33,953
- Hi. Padre.
- Michel.

206
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,539
Sounds great, Lelani.

207
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:41,002
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Sure.

208
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:50,761
Two and two is four,
four and four is eight. Keep it up!

209
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:03,608
So you and the kids must move in
with me and pretend you're mine.

210
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:06,611
But, Uncle Guns, I don't understand.

211
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:10,573
First you tell me
I have a sister coming from America.

212
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,287
- Then you say we're to leave home.
- Only until your father returns.

213
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:20,833
But wouldn't it be proper
for me and my brother and sister

214
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,171
to welcome her here
in the absence of my father?

215
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,466
The child is right.
What you propose is monstrous.

216
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:34,305
I hate this as much as you do, Padre.
But I'd cut my right arm off for Doc.

217
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:38,601
You know when we was clobbering
Nips in that delaying action?

218
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,437
It's the same, only this time
we're fighting for the Doc.

219
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:46,025
We're trying to buy time,
so he can tell her in his own way.

220
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,778
I understand.

221
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:58,079
- It's because I'm not white!
- Lelani! Lelani!

222
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:31,988
It's going to be all right.

223
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:34,198
Don't worry, just...

224
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:40,538
...just trust me here.
It's going to be all right.

225
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:59,033
Let go of your starboard anchor.
Come on, look lively, blast your eyes!

226
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,702
Step to it!

227
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:15,132
Ahoy, Mike!

228
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:19,553
Back water.

229
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:26,477
I don't see your father here,
Miss Dedham.

230
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,647
He's not expecting me.
He doesn't know I'm coming.

231
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:33,943
I'm sorry. I took the liberty
of sending him a radio.

232
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:38,239
Thank you very much, Captain.

233
00:27:39,698 --> 00:27:41,784
Excuse me, miss.

234
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:49,208
Skipper, hi! Have you a Miss Amelia
Dedham from Boston aboard?

235
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:54,505
<i>Aloha. Name is Donovan.</i>

236
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:59,426
Welcome to Haleakaloha.
Your father is out in the low islands.

237
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:03,305
- We'll see you ashore.
- Thank you, Mr. McDonough.

238
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,892
The name is Donovan.

239
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:13,107
- You'll have to take it careful...
- I am quite capable of leaving a ship.

240
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:22,866
Ease your duff
onto that rail, now.

241
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:27,746
Ah... Sit on the rail
and swing your legs outboard.

242
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:29,873
Limbs.

243
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,585
Now take it easy, miss.

244
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:37,214
All right, Sam, watch these swells.

245
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:42,052
Watch it, Sam.
A little more starboard. Easy now.

246
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:46,765
All right, Sam. All right.
Give me your hand.

247
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:50,269
Hard to port.

248
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:10,914
Take your...!
Of all the stupid...!

249
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:15,919
- I don't need your help.
- This is no place to argue. Get in.

250
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,309
Of all the stupid, imbecilic oafs!

251
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:33,312
I read you loud and clear!

252
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:38,317
Thank you, Mr. Whatever-your-name-is.
Please take me ashore.

253
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,281
- Oh, my bag!
- Kioki!

254
00:29:57,836 --> 00:29:59,463
Thank you.

255
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,174
Will you please take me ashore?

256
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:05,844
All right, Sam. Head for the beach.

257
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,730
Mr. Eu, I do not believe this is the
proper time to meet the very wealthy

258
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:20,025
and marriageable Miss Dedham.

259
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:39,813
- Get in.
- Hey, the dame's all wet.

260
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,524
And so are you.

261
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:45,777
This gentleman
is from Massachusetts, also.

262
00:31:45,944 --> 00:31:49,614
- One of the Gilhooleys from Fall River.
- Fascinating.

263
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:52,326
Ain't I met you some place before?

264
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:55,787
Pango-Pango?

265
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,334
Hong Kong, huh?

266
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:04,796
I have not had the pleasure
of meeting you in Pango-Pango,

267
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:08,884
Hong Kong, nor Fall River.
Please drive on.

268
00:32:09,051 --> 00:32:11,344
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

269
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:25,233
How much did you say she was worth
according to Dun and Bradstreet?

270
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,652
$18 million.

271
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:33,700
18? Well, always my lucky number.

272
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:48,715
Wait here.

273
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:01,144
Show legs, please?

274
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,731
Very pretty. Very pretty.

275
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:08,610
- You've got a nerve!
- Wear this until you're dry.

276
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:10,779
Then here's a dress.

277
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:13,532
- No, thanks.
- No sale.

278
00:33:13,698 --> 00:33:16,034
Please take me to a hotel.

279
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:20,247
You'll sleep at your father's place,
or on the beach.

280
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:51,653
My father lives here?

281
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,322
Sure. Any complaints?

282
00:34:18,513 --> 00:34:23,059
- What is that building?
- It's your father's hospital.

283
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:27,105
He built it... if you're interested.

284
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:38,867
Miss Dedham,
this is Yoshi and Koshi.

285
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:46,207
You'd better get out of those
wet clothes. Give her a hot bath.

286
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:49,669
I'm quite capable
of giving instructions to servants.

287
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:55,133
I'm quite sure you are. I'll go
down to the beach and get your bag.

288
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,427
Thank you very much.

289
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:01,890
Thank you.

290
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:06,222
Hey, there!

291
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,604
Whoa, son!
Looks like we'll have to face the music.

292
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,856
Sorry we woke you up.

293
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:19,819
I know this will sound fishy,
but the kid forgot his Stan Musial cap.

294
00:37:19,986 --> 00:37:24,240
- His what?
- My cap, that Stan the Man sent me.

295
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:27,535
- He said he couldn't sleep without it.
- Hi.

296
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:30,204
- Hi, Luki.
- Hello, Luki.

297
00:37:30,371 --> 00:37:35,209
Hi, Koshi. Hi, Yoshi.
I bet you've never seen me up this late.

298
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:37,295
Pipe down.

299
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:39,881
Is this child your son?

300
00:37:40,048 --> 00:37:44,135
Oh... Yeah. He's... This is Luke.

301
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:48,598
Everyone calls me Luki.
And I have two sisters.

302
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:53,311
I bet they don't even know I'm out, huh,
Uncle Guns? I mean, Papa Guns?

303
00:37:53,478 --> 00:37:57,523
- What about your mother?
- Mother?

304
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:02,862
- She's dead.
- Oh, God, I wish I was in my own bed.

305
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:06,366
It's high time you were in bed.

306
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:10,661
- It's really none of my business, Mr.
- Donovan.

307
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:15,541
You should be ashamed,
taking a child out in a storm.

308
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:19,295
Taking him out? I've been chasing
him all over the island.

309
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:21,672
Would you like to sleep here?

310
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,678
In a real bed instead of the
hard old cot he makes me sleep on?

311
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:32,475
Why should you complain? I'm sleeping
in a hammock. I ought to belt you.

312
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:35,603
Really, Mr. Donovan,
must you bully everyone?

313
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,108
- Take him up to the big room.
- Sleep tight, Uncle Guns.

314
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:42,944
I intend to. Good and tight.

315
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:48,533
Mr. Donovan, why don't you go home?
Or go to that saloon of yours?

316
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:52,662
If you're a typical father,
I realise how grateful I am

317
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:56,499
never to have seen my own. Goodnight.

318
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:36,956
Mademoiselle Dedham.

319
00:39:43,462 --> 00:39:45,006
Why are you here?

320
00:39:45,172 --> 00:39:50,428
I slept here last night and I can come
back any time I want, right, Amelia?

321
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:53,931
- Right.
- May I present myself?

322
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:57,393
Marquis de Lage,
governor of this island paradise,

323
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,314
- which finds in you its fairest flower.
- Hot dog!

324
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:05,902
- Well...
- I intended to greet you yesterday.

325
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:11,532
But, alas, the duties of office!
But here I am, such as I am.

326
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:14,452
I place myself and my automobile,

327
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:18,122
and you will observe,
it's an American automobile, 1944,

328
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:21,375
complete with driver,
at your service. Mr. Eu.

329
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:26,297
- Amherst, '52.
- Mr. Eu.

330
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:31,552
If I may venture a suggestion,
a scenic drive, a chilled aperitif?

331
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:38,017
- I have a picnic basket...
- That's very kind, Your Excellency.

332
00:40:38,184 --> 00:40:41,020
But I promised to take Luki home.

333
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:45,066
Knock it off, Uncle Andy.
Quit horning in on my date.

334
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:48,361
Luki, your manners, remember?

335
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:54,283
Perhaps Your Excellency would be so
kind as to drive us to Luki's father's.

336
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,495
The history of my life.

337
00:40:57,662 --> 00:41:03,334
To reach towards the rose,
only to be pierced by its thorn.

338
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:31,695
18 million bucks.

339
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:48,129
- Morning, Padre.
- Morning, Michel.

340
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:50,923
- Good morning, Padre.
- Captain.

341
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,260
That was a marvellous sermon
this morning, Father.

342
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:14,446
<i>La boîte à jukes...
The juke's box, there is no music?</i>

343
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:17,158
It think it's busted, Father.

344
00:42:17,324 --> 00:42:21,036
<i>I don't understand.
Les Chinois, they...</i>

345
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:25,666
I don't know anything about
those things. I think it's busted.

346
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:30,254
<i>Busted? No music?
C'est trop drôle.</i>

347
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:42,308
- Let's have another date sometime.
- Sure, but right now you get to school.

348
00:42:42,474 --> 00:42:44,059
Ah, piano lessons!

349
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:47,855
Sorry, miss, but Mr. Donovan
don't allow no ladies in.

350
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:55,196
Oh, really? That's all right, Sergeant.
I promise I won't start any rhubarbs.

351
00:42:58,365 --> 00:43:04,872
Now hear this, now hear this.
Mayday. I repeat. Mayday.

352
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,584
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

353
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:12,671
My apologies, Mr. Donovan.
Really, no women?

354
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:18,093
- You're very welcome, Miss Dedham.
- Actually, I came here on business.

355
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,430
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

356
00:43:22,306 --> 00:43:25,559
<i>I'd like to charter the Araner
for however long it takes</i>

357
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:29,438
to find my father,
and take me back to Honolulu.

358
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:32,858
<i>- As to that...
- The Araner is not for charter.</i>

359
00:43:33,025 --> 00:43:37,655
She has too much draught for the
low islands. Reefs and coral heads.

360
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:43,202
Thank you, Mr. Donovan.
I was speaking to the sailing master.

361
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:46,080
<i>- Captain...
- I own the Araner.</i>

362
00:43:46,246 --> 00:43:49,291
<i>And the Inishmore,
the Inishfree and several others.</i>

363
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:54,797
You might say that we are rivals,
competitors in the shipping business.

364
00:43:54,963 --> 00:43:57,758
- Cigarette?
- Excuse me.

365
00:44:01,095 --> 00:44:04,306
- Thank you.
- You smoke?

366
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:08,394
- Yes, I smoke.
- Well, then, perhaps...

367
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,646
Rain check?

368
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:37,214
Mr. Donovan,
I was quite rude last night.

369
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:39,717
Please accept my humble apologies.

370
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:46,181
I also was rather abrupt. Pax?

371
00:44:47,724 --> 00:44:49,810
Pax.

372
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:55,941
- I was tired and frightened and...
- And wet?

373
00:44:56,108 --> 00:45:01,447
Very wet. And to come halfway
around the world only to be told...

374
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:05,701
I wouldn't worry about your father,
Miss Dedham. He'll be back shortly.

375
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:10,873
He wouldn't want to miss Christmas
with his patients in the hospital.

376
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,292
On the house, huh?

377
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:23,760
How was my boy Luki?
How did he behave?

378
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:27,014
He was charming.

379
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:31,435
And entertaining...
Oh, and very educational.

380
00:45:31,602 --> 00:45:38,692
I learned all about Mr. Musial's
batting average, runs batted in,

381
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:41,612
then he fell asleep in my arms.

382
00:45:41,778 --> 00:45:44,615
- As Shakespeare said...
- Quite.

383
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:59,254
<i>Dérangé, out of order and so forth.
Explanation?</i>

384
00:45:59,421 --> 00:46:06,929
Slot machine. Shipped in here six
years ago. Busted. It is still busted.

385
00:46:07,095 --> 00:46:09,223
But why?

386
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:14,561
I do not attempt to explore
the depths of the oriental mind.

387
00:46:14,728 --> 00:46:19,107
Perhaps your Ivy League chaperone
could explain to my clients again

388
00:46:19,274 --> 00:46:20,692
that it is busted.

389
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:23,487
That's reasonable. Mr. Eu.

390
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:28,742
I will try to explain it to them
in their barbarian tongue.

391
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,525
Carriage trade.

392
00:47:01,692 --> 00:47:06,822
Lunch. Kids. My children.

393
00:47:09,116 --> 00:47:11,743
Chopin.

394
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:17,457
Mozart, perhaps?

395
00:47:21,294 --> 00:47:23,547
Oh, Joe College?

396
00:47:23,714 --> 00:47:26,758
Two years. Football. Broken ankle.

397
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:28,885
Navy.

398
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:35,600
Miss Dedham,
I'd like to have you meet the family.

399
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:38,770
Thank you.

400
00:47:41,064 --> 00:47:44,568
Of course, you may find
Father Cluzeot somewhat of a bully.

401
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:57,581
- Hi, Amelia.
- Father Cluzeot, meet Miss Dedham.

402
00:47:57,748 --> 00:48:00,000
<i>- How do you do?
- Enchanté.</i>

403
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:04,963
- This is my oldest girl, Lelani.
- Lelani.

404
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,842
- You play beautifully.
- Thank you.

405
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:14,514
- This is my other girl.
- Well, you're a little doll.

406
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:18,351
- What's your name?
- Sarah, but they call me Sally.

407
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:24,983
Sarah? My name's Amelia,
but nobody ever called me Sally.

408
00:48:25,442 --> 00:48:26,818
No?

409
00:48:26,985 --> 00:48:31,072
- Father, it's Wednesday. Water-skiing.
- No.

410
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:34,367
- You promised Lelani.
- One hour.

411
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:39,206
- May I come?
- Water-skiing is a very dangerous sport,

412
00:48:39,372 --> 00:48:41,833
particularly in these waters.
I don't think...

413
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,960
Perhaps you could teach me.

414
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:47,255
Please let her come along.

415
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,009
OK.

416
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:55,055
No. Lesson is lesson.
After the lesson. One hour.

417
00:49:13,323 --> 00:49:15,116
Hit it!

418
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:24,042
Stop it, you monster!

419
00:49:49,734 --> 00:49:55,365
I would like a bathing costume.

420
00:50:00,578 --> 00:50:03,915
- Bikini, bikini. Number one bikini.
- Very pretty.

421
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:08,628
- Bikini!
- I think that's a little little.

422
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:20,348
Old-fashioned one.

423
00:50:28,106 --> 00:50:31,151
- Pretty.
- Very.

424
00:50:33,361 --> 00:50:36,865
- Good morning, Miss...
- Lafleur.

425
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:44,247
What a beautiful gown.
Are you contemplating matrimony?

426
00:50:45,623 --> 00:50:51,463
What young girl of my age
doesn't contemplate matrimony?

427
00:50:51,629 --> 00:50:54,048
How true.

428
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,846
Miss Dedham. Very proper.

429
00:51:04,934 --> 00:51:07,353
Very pretty.

430
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:10,523
And pants.

431
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,443
- Yes.
- A looking glass?

432
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,570
Thank you.

433
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:29,083
Thank you,
but I don't think this is quite...

434
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:32,462
Baby, right up your alley.

435
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:41,346
You know, I believe you're right.

436
00:51:54,901 --> 00:51:58,238
- Holy Moses!
- Amelia Dedham.

437
00:51:58,404 --> 00:52:02,492
<i>- Ravissante, Amelia.
- Thank you, André.</i>

438
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:07,705
- Let's go, Miss Bunker Hill.
- Breed's Hill.

439
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:13,836
Right, let's go.

440
00:52:24,055 --> 00:52:29,269
By the way, have you dispatched
that application for transfer yet?

441
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:31,938
Miami Beach?

442
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:34,732
- Yes, sir.
- Cancel it.

443
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:55,962
Well, she made it.

444
00:52:58,047 --> 00:53:00,258
Faster!

445
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:09,726
Let's go.

446
00:53:12,895 --> 00:53:15,231
Faster! Faster!

447
00:53:20,403 --> 00:53:26,659
Faster, huh? We'll give her something
to write home to Boston about.

448
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:28,786
Oh, no!

449
00:53:39,964 --> 00:53:42,341
No, Uncle Guns, no!

450
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:03,112
Gee, Miss Dedham, I'm sorry.

451
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:10,912
Oh, that's quite all right, Mr. Donovan.

452
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,255
- Fun?
- Funny.

453
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:26,719
- You mad?
- Mad?

454
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:35,436
<i>The Araner's shoving off tomorrow
morning, so I'll have to check her out.</i>

455
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:39,774
- Take the boat. I'm going to swim in.
- I'll race you.

456
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:43,736
- You'll race me?
- Yes.

457
00:54:43,903 --> 00:54:45,988
Let's go.

458
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,899
Ready?

459
00:55:23,025 --> 00:55:26,571
Let's... Let's go.

460
00:55:28,155 --> 00:55:33,244
One for the money, two for the show,
three to get ready, four to go!

461
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:36,372
Go, Amelia! Go! Go, go, go!

462
00:55:37,582 --> 00:55:40,626
Go, Amelia! Go!

463
00:56:07,153 --> 00:56:10,281
You're out of condition, Mr. Donovan.

464
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:21,500
Match.

465
00:56:25,588 --> 00:56:30,301
Oh, gee. I'm sorry, Mr. Donovan.

466
00:56:33,387 --> 00:56:36,265
That's quite all right, Miss Dedham.

467
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:41,937
- Pax?
- Pax.

468
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:13,010
- That's a pretty one.
- Last year we had it bigger.

469
00:57:13,177 --> 00:57:16,097
- Let's tie it on.
- Let me help.

470
00:57:16,263 --> 00:57:20,768
No. Stan the Man and I can get it,
can't we, Stan?

471
00:57:22,937 --> 00:57:26,106
Tie it off. No more grannies, now.

472
00:57:54,468 --> 00:57:58,722
Why, Lelani, that was lovely.
What do the words mean?

473
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:02,309
I was thanking
the goddess of the canyon for our tree.

474
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:07,273
Goddess? Do you believe
in gods and goddesses?

475
00:58:08,023 --> 00:58:10,943
I believe in the one God, as we all do,

476
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:15,281
but I respect the beliefs
and customs of my people.

477
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,710
- Uncle Guns!
- I tell you, it is a granny!

478
00:59:09,877 --> 00:59:11,962
The monument.

479
00:59:30,064 --> 00:59:33,650
"Princess Manulani.

480
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:36,403
"Commander William...

481
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,781
"...Dedham.

482
00:59:38,947 --> 00:59:42,701
"Michael Patrick Donovan.

483
00:59:42,868 --> 00:59:46,121
"Thomas Aloy-sius Gilhooley..."

484
00:59:46,288 --> 00:59:49,500
Thomas Aloysius Gilhooley.

485
00:59:50,626 --> 00:59:53,837
Does this mean
there was fighting on this island?

486
00:59:54,004 --> 00:59:57,091
Those gold stars
don't stand for good behaviour.

487
00:59:57,257 --> 00:59:59,635
- Tell me.
- Not much to tell.

488
00:59:59,802 --> 01:00:05,307
We got blown off our can, that's a
destroyer, and ended up on the island.

489
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:07,726
There was a big Jap base down there.

490
01:00:07,893 --> 01:00:12,940
So we hid out here in the hills,
down in those caves.

491
01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:16,610
Tossed a few monkey wrenches
into their machinery.

492
01:00:16,777 --> 01:00:19,571
Threw 'em a few spitballs.

493
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:25,410
It's hard to believe
war has been within 1,000 miles

494
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:28,747
of a place as peaceful as this.

495
01:00:28,914 --> 01:00:32,417
Frangipani and flame-throwers
don't seem to go together,

496
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:34,586
but that's the way it was.

497
01:00:34,753 --> 01:00:38,715
- We better get back down the hill.
- But...

498
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:43,095
- Who was the princess?
- We'd better go. It's a long drive.

499
01:00:43,262 --> 01:00:46,306
All right, kids. Into the jeep.

500
01:00:46,473 --> 01:00:48,559
- Up we go.
- OK?

501
01:00:49,434 --> 01:00:53,188
How is this thing? On here solid?

502
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,660
You are late. Nobody listens to me.

503
01:01:06,827 --> 01:01:11,456
We had to get a tree. What would
Christmas be without a tree?

504
01:01:11,623 --> 01:01:15,085
- It's a long way up that valley.
- I've an idea.

505
01:01:15,252 --> 01:01:18,088
Would you like to spend
Christmas at my house?

506
01:01:23,302 --> 01:01:29,474
You mean that would be better than
putting a tree up in a saloon?

507
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:39,776
No. Naturally, you want to spend
Christmas with your father.

508
01:01:40,861 --> 01:01:47,200
Thank you. It would be very nice to
spend Christmas at your father's house.

509
01:01:48,243 --> 01:01:51,121
Well, that settles that.

510
01:01:52,372 --> 01:01:58,462
Father, not that way,
that's a saloon. The gate.

511
01:02:11,141 --> 01:02:12,976
Michael, who was Manulani?

512
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:19,441
She was the granddaughter of the
last hereditary prince of these islands.

513
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:24,363
- What happened to her?
- She died in childbirth.

514
01:02:57,396 --> 01:03:00,899
<i>I'm going to California</i>

515
01:03:01,066 --> 01:03:03,652
<i>When I come back, we'll be married</i>

516
01:03:03,819 --> 01:03:06,571
<i>What do you want me to bring you?</i>

517
01:03:06,738 --> 01:03:10,158
<i>And this is what she said...</i>

518
01:03:10,325 --> 01:03:13,412
<i>A hat with a crooked crown</i>

519
01:03:13,578 --> 01:03:16,123
<i>Silver buckles for my shoes</i>

520
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,584
<i>A boa with feathers</i>

521
01:03:20,085 --> 01:03:22,796
<i>A scalloped petticoat</i>

522
01:03:24,631 --> 01:03:28,260
<i>And a short, tight dress</i>

523
01:03:32,556 --> 01:03:33,932
Well?

524
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:36,935
I have the pleasure
to inform Your Excellency

525
01:03:37,102 --> 01:03:40,730
that your worst fears
have been realised.

526
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:47,362
- I knew he was up to something.
- Indubitably. In a canoe.

527
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:49,573
Canoe?

528
01:03:50,824 --> 01:03:52,534
A canoe?

529
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,788
But I have a plan.

530
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:40,248
- Bravo!
- Are you trying to crab my act?

531
01:04:40,415 --> 01:04:44,920
My apologies, mademoiselle. Boy!
A drink for mademoiselle. Champagne.

532
01:04:45,086 --> 01:04:49,925
No, no, no. My voice.
A slug of gin, if you please.

533
01:04:50,091 --> 01:04:55,096
- Your work permit has expired.
- And your tourist permit.

534
01:04:55,263 --> 01:05:02,062
But we have a plan of Mr. Donovan's
house. Here is his bathroom.

535
01:05:02,228 --> 01:05:04,606
You're telling me.

536
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:19,287
Come on, Sally.

537
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:12,882
- Oh, those children.
- Yeah, it's the same thing every night.

538
01:06:13,049 --> 01:06:17,679
You know, Michael Donovan,
you're quite a fella.

539
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:25,353
Well, you know,
Amelia Dedham, you're quite a gal.

540
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,522
Cigarette?

541
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:35,113
- What's the matter?
- I thought you were going to kiss me.

542
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,492
- What?
- Well, I have been kissed before.

543
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:05,894
Well, I...
I thought I'd been kissed before.

544
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:22,660
- I wonder if those kids are really asleep.
- I'll sit this one out.

545
01:07:22,827 --> 01:07:27,498
- I'll walk you home.
- No, I'll walk this off.

546
01:07:27,665 --> 01:07:29,834
Goodnight, Michael.

547
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:48,227
<i>Oh, the monkeys had no tails
In Zamboanga</i>

548
01:07:48,394 --> 01:07:50,772
<i>Oh, the monkeys had no tails...</i>

549
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:53,483
Have you a light, Michael?

550
01:07:57,779 --> 01:08:03,326
It's a gag, Mike. That Chinaman,
that Mr. Eu. It's all a gag!

551
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:16,673
You idiot. A hammock.

552
01:08:32,063 --> 01:08:34,273
SOS. Go!

553
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:44,701
Let's have it.

554
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:49,706
"Doc. Mayday.
Your Boston daughter here."

555
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:52,792
- Dotter. D-O-T-T-E-R.
- That's right, two T's.

556
01:08:52,959 --> 01:08:55,753
"Insert name of"?
Her name's Amelia, you dope.

557
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,424
How would I know?
I ain't shacking up with her.

558
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:04,637
"Boston daughter Amelia here.

559
01:09:04,804 --> 01:09:11,227
"Your kids living at my house.
Supposed to be mine.

560
01:09:11,394 --> 01:09:14,856
"Mayday, Doc.
Watch your step. Guns."

561
01:09:31,664 --> 01:09:33,791
He's reading.

562
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:36,752
His kids?

563
01:11:17,728 --> 01:11:21,357
Doctor Dedham, I presume.

564
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,570
Amelia.

565
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,995
Father.

566
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:49,093
- Oh, Doctor-san.
- Yoshi, Koshi.

567
01:11:52,972 --> 01:11:56,976
- Bath's ready, Doctor.
- How'd it go?

568
01:11:57,143 --> 01:12:00,980
Fine. I'm no brain surgeon,
but she'll be all right.

569
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:03,566
I'm glad.

570
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:06,569
- Do you like it?
- Very much.

571
01:12:07,445 --> 01:12:10,406
I invited some children
over for Christmas.

572
01:12:10,573 --> 01:12:13,451
Three of the sweetest kids
in the world.

573
01:12:13,617 --> 01:12:16,537
Little half-castes.

574
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,381
- Mr. Donovan's. You know them.
- Yes, I know them.

575
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:34,555
Look. The generator's working.

576
01:12:38,184 --> 01:12:42,938
- Do you mind?
- No. No, not at all.

577
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:46,150
I'll go shave and get cleaned up, huh?

578
01:12:46,317 --> 01:12:49,653
- I'll have tea ready.
- Good.

579
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,709
Thank you, Yoshi.

580
01:13:10,758 --> 01:13:13,010
Thank you.

581
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,395
- No cream.
- It isn't cream.

582
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:28,400
- Rum?
- Shh.

583
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:32,071
Aunt Sarah
and Grand-uncle Sedley might hear.

584
01:13:33,364 --> 01:13:35,074
That's right. I'd forgotten.

585
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:38,869
"The Dedhams have never traded in rum.

586
01:13:39,036 --> 01:13:41,997
"We refer to it as West Indies goods."

587
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:47,920
To Aunt Sarah, Grand-uncle Sedley
and West Indies goods.

588
01:13:48,087 --> 01:13:50,089
<i>- Skol.
- Slainte.</i>

589
01:13:50,256 --> 01:13:54,343
Since when have you been
acquiring Irish?

590
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:57,596
Oh, Guns Donovan.

591
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:00,891
How do you know
it isn't Mr. Gilhooley?

592
01:14:01,058 --> 01:14:02,559
Gilhooley?

593
01:14:04,603 --> 01:14:10,859
No. I'd just like you to know that
I've signed all my shares over to you.

594
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:16,156
- No, I'd rather you kept them.
- Why?

595
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:21,245
Perhaps admiration for my father?

596
01:14:22,955 --> 01:14:24,915
Thanks.

597
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:29,128
I couldn't care less about
the Dedham Shipping Company.

598
01:14:30,295 --> 01:14:35,718
The very mention of it gives me cold
chills. That's true of Boston, too.

599
01:14:37,344 --> 01:14:42,224
I remember how happy I was to
become the father of a fine baby girl.

600
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:46,812
That was early in the war.
The months went on. The years.

601
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:50,315
The letters got fewer and fewer.
Then none at all.

602
01:14:50,482 --> 01:14:55,571
- You knew that Mother was...
- I didn't. And no one bothered to write.

603
01:14:57,531 --> 01:15:03,245
Then we were torpedoed.
A lot of the men were killed.

604
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:07,958
A few of us managed to get to a raft.
Ten days later, we got here.

605
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:10,794
The sensible thing
would've been to surrender.

606
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:16,175
But the people hid us, fed us,
nursed us, and some even died for us.

607
01:15:17,676 --> 01:15:21,096
We owed them something for that.

608
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:26,935
They didn't have a doctor on the island,
and God knows they needed one.

609
01:15:28,896 --> 01:15:32,900
I didn't know about your mother
until five months afterwards.

610
01:15:33,066 --> 01:15:36,361
When I was discharged
at Pearl Harbor

611
01:15:36,528 --> 01:15:39,865
I couldn't bring myself
to go back to Boston.

612
01:15:40,032 --> 01:15:45,162
I wasn't needed there.
But I was desperately needed here.

613
01:15:48,207 --> 01:15:53,837
I know I failed
in my responsibility to you.

614
01:15:54,004 --> 01:15:57,299
But there were children here, too.

615
01:15:57,466 --> 01:16:02,346
Children I'd brought into the world,
who might die if I wasn't around.

616
01:16:04,932 --> 01:16:09,728
- I understand all that, but...
- Why couldn't I have gone back?

617
01:16:09,895 --> 01:16:15,317
- Even for a visit?
- There must've been other doctors.

618
01:16:15,901 --> 01:16:20,572
That's very true.
But, you see, by that time I...

619
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:44,012
Isn't that sweet?
They're bringing you flowers.

620
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:46,640
That's "welcome".
Of course, you know that.

621
01:16:54,064 --> 01:16:58,235
Why did they do that? Why don't
they come on up? I'll go get them.

622
01:16:58,402 --> 01:17:00,487
Amelia.

623
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,740
Yes.

624
01:17:08,412 --> 01:17:12,165
Well, "'The time has come,' the Walrus
said, 'to speak of many things... '

625
01:17:12,332 --> 01:17:17,713
- "'Of sailing ships and sealing wax... '
- 'And cabbages and kings.'"

626
01:17:17,879 --> 01:17:19,965
I've been here about...

627
01:17:20,882 --> 01:17:25,721
Well, horse and buggy time. Good old
Doc Dedham. Excuse me, dear.

628
01:17:45,991 --> 01:17:50,162
- It's an emergency.
- I understood. May I help?

629
01:17:52,956 --> 01:17:58,295
All right. Come on.
Help me scrub up.

630
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:32,954
<i>Mes chers enfants, bon et joyeux Noël.
Merry Christmas.</i>

631
01:18:39,252 --> 01:18:44,341
My children, once again we've come
to that holy time of the year.

632
01:18:44,508 --> 01:18:51,556
Time for giving,
for loving and for remembering.

633
01:18:51,723 --> 01:18:55,227
Tonight we have much
to be grateful for.

634
01:18:55,393 --> 01:18:59,272
All of us. And I perhaps most of all.

635
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:05,612
Because our chapel has,
at long last, an organ.

636
01:19:07,614 --> 01:19:13,245
A magnificent organ.
A gift of Miss Amelia Dedham.

637
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:19,000
Mademoiselle, I weep for joy.

638
01:19:21,419 --> 01:19:23,255
Forgive me.

639
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:46,778
A gift of $150 for the repair
of the chapel roof,

640
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:49,531
donated by Messrs Donovan
and Gilhooley...

641
01:19:53,493 --> 01:19:57,998
...has been crossed out.
The poor are still with us.

642
01:20:01,418 --> 01:20:05,672
Before we proceed with the pageant
that Mother Gabrielle has prepared,

643
01:20:05,839 --> 01:20:11,678
I'd like to say that the Royal Australian
Navy has again sent a corvette

644
01:20:11,845 --> 01:20:16,349
to do honour to the hereditary
princess of our island paradise.

645
01:20:16,516 --> 01:20:20,020
I would like to thank
our brave and noble allies

646
01:20:20,186 --> 01:20:24,024
in the name
of the Republic of France.

647
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:27,527
We thank the Governor.

648
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:53,636
"And thus it came to pass that the
child was born in the city of David,

649
01:20:53,803 --> 01:20:56,014
"called Bethlehem.

650
01:20:56,181 --> 01:21:01,394
"And, behold,
a star appeared in the heavens."

651
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:26,920
Hi, Amelia.

652
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:02,080
- Horse and buggy?
- See Amelia gets home.

653
01:22:02,247 --> 01:22:04,874
Affirmative.

654
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:20,807
"And then from the East
came three wise men,

655
01:22:20,974 --> 01:22:24,394
"three kings bearing gifts,

656
01:22:24,561 --> 01:22:31,401
"to gaze upon the child and to kneel
before him in adoration.

657
01:22:31,568 --> 01:22:33,778
"The King of...

658
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,410
"...Polynesia.

659
01:22:59,721 --> 01:23:03,975
"The Emperor of China.

"The King of...

661
01:23:20,074 --> 01:23:22,952
"The King
of the United States of America."

662
01:24:30,895 --> 01:24:34,023
Steady on, lads. Steady. Sing out.

663
01:27:08,761 --> 01:27:12,223
<i>- Bonjour. Bon Noël.
- Father Cluzeot.</i>

664
01:27:21,482 --> 01:27:24,443
- I want the truth.
- Ah, the truth!

665
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:30,699
Who doesn't seek the truth?
All of us. All men. Everywhere.

666
01:27:30,866 --> 01:27:33,744
You know what truth I mean.

667
01:27:40,209 --> 01:27:43,379
The Navy Cross,
three Purple Hearts...

668
01:27:43,546 --> 01:27:45,339
No, no, no.

669
01:27:45,506 --> 01:27:47,258
Not there.

670
01:27:48,134 --> 01:27:54,807
<i>Here. Where it is enquired situation
de famille. Observe what he writes.</i>

671
01:27:55,766 --> 01:27:57,309
<i>Célibataire.</i>

672
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:01,438
<i>Célibataire. A bachelor.
Donovan is unmarried.</i>

673
01:28:01,605 --> 01:28:07,278
Well, there is our Mike Donovan.
Three children and not one marriage.

674
01:28:07,444 --> 01:28:11,323
He's not the first man
to put the cart before the horse,

675
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,659
but three carts and no horse?

676
01:28:15,953 --> 01:28:17,538
Unforgivable.

677
01:28:17,705 --> 01:28:19,832
When I think
how he has deceived you!

678
01:28:19,999 --> 01:28:23,085
Playing upon your sympathies,
pretending to be a fine father,

679
01:28:23,252 --> 01:28:26,839
I could tear my beard out by the roots.

680
01:28:27,006 --> 01:28:31,677
- And it's such a beautiful beard.
- Yes, isn't it?

681
01:28:31,844 --> 01:28:37,099
You'd be amazed if I told you how many
wom... Well, that's not important.

682
01:28:37,266 --> 01:28:41,937
<i>Tell me, chère Amélie, hasn't this
revelation changed your...</i>

683
01:28:42,104 --> 01:28:45,357
...your affections towards Donovan?

684
01:28:45,524 --> 01:28:49,320
Indeed it has. And for reasons
you would never suspect.

685
01:28:55,284 --> 01:28:57,703
The place is out of bounds.

686
01:28:57,870 --> 01:29:00,873
Quiet now. You're all going
to the garden parties.

687
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,960
- What about the beer?
- There's lashings of drinks.

688
01:29:05,127 --> 01:29:08,213
- Orangeade, lemonade...
- Papaya-ade.

689
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:10,925
- Iced tea.
- Iced tea!

690
01:29:11,091 --> 01:29:15,512
Now, shove off, like the nice
little gentlemen you are. Go on, now.

691
01:29:18,974 --> 01:29:20,809
Hey, look!

692
01:29:23,979 --> 01:29:27,316
Oh, no, no, no!

693
01:29:27,483 --> 01:29:29,860
- Let's have some service.
- How about some beer?

694
01:29:30,027 --> 01:29:34,281
- Get a move on.
- How about some bottles of beer?

695
01:29:34,448 --> 01:29:37,785
Come on, let's have some beer.

696
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:16,699
All right, the joint's closed.

697
01:30:16,865 --> 01:30:20,202
Why don't you Limeys shove off?

698
01:30:20,369 --> 01:30:21,954
Limeys?

699
01:30:23,372 --> 01:30:26,667
I distinctly heard him say that.
Limeys.

700
01:30:26,834 --> 01:30:29,962
"Limeys," he said.

701
01:30:34,883 --> 01:30:38,637
I beg your pardon, did I understand
you to say "Limeys"?

702
01:30:38,804 --> 01:30:42,683
- I heard him.
- Gilhooley, where's my suit?

703
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:48,021
- Stay out of this. You might get hurt.
- You looking for trouble?

704
01:30:48,188 --> 01:30:50,190
Tipperary born and bred. Limeys?

705
01:30:50,357 --> 01:30:54,069
You're not going to allow three
against one, even if it is Gilhooley?

706
01:30:54,236 --> 01:30:56,905
I've seen it done.

707
01:30:58,407 --> 01:31:02,244
- Three against two.
- Me?

708
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:08,709
It's the holidays.
Christmas. Have a drink.

709
01:31:08,876 --> 01:31:11,670
- I will, then.
- On the house.

710
01:31:11,837 --> 01:31:16,300
Look, we're noble allies.
Coral Seas, we were with you.

711
01:31:16,466 --> 01:31:18,760
- He's got a point.
- A definite point.

712
01:31:18,927 --> 01:31:24,516
- My apologies and a merry Christmas.
- Happy New Year.

713
01:31:24,683 --> 01:31:28,854
Festus! My little brother.

714
01:31:30,898 --> 01:31:34,443
Festus, we're having a sporting event.

715
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:36,862
Turn your hat around.

716
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:40,949
You are now a Yank.
Three against three.

717
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:46,872
Hey, Guns!

718
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:52,794
Festus! Festus!

719
01:31:52,961 --> 01:31:55,130
Oh, shut up.

720
01:32:12,648 --> 01:32:14,024
Gilhooley!

721
01:32:16,193 --> 01:32:20,280
- Festus, you're a Yank.
- Festus! Festus!

722
01:32:30,248 --> 01:32:34,336
- Let's have a beer.
- I'm sorry about the piano.

723
01:32:34,503 --> 01:32:36,838
Don't worry about the piano.

724
01:32:37,005 --> 01:32:41,093
- What's a piano amongst friends?
- That's a good one.

725
01:32:41,259 --> 01:32:47,307
Peace on Earth and goodwill to men.

726
01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:52,187
Oui, free beer! Free beer!

727
01:32:59,569 --> 01:33:02,280
I told you Limeys to get out of here.

728
01:33:28,724 --> 01:33:32,102
Why aren't you at the garden party,
you heathen?!

729
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:51,621
Knock it off, fellas.
It's a holiday. Peace on Earth.

730
01:33:52,456 --> 01:33:56,251
That'll get you a fat lip. Free beer!

731
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:22,486
Hey, quit it! What are you doing?

732
01:34:54,476 --> 01:34:58,355
- Who started it?
- I did, sir. Respectfully.

733
01:34:58,521 --> 01:35:01,775
- See you on the mat in the morning.
- Aye, sir.

734
01:35:03,401 --> 01:35:08,114
- Carry on.
- Left turn.

735
01:35:08,281 --> 01:35:10,492
Quick march.

736
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:21,253
- Gilhooley.
- Pardon me, Padre.

737
01:35:22,963 --> 01:35:26,508
<i>- Is this yours?
- Non, c'est la boîte à jukes.</i>

738
01:35:26,675 --> 01:35:32,347
<i>Juke's box. Music. Comme ça.
Regardez. Voilà. Music.</i>

739
01:35:55,745 --> 01:36:03,336
Charming. Lisette, Joanne,
Annelle, Kalua, Nani, Lani.

740
01:36:03,503 --> 01:36:08,258
I am like a fath...
I am like a father to them all.

741
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:34,427
Put your hat on, you brat!

742
01:37:34,594 --> 01:37:37,472
Aw, shut up!

743
01:37:42,268 --> 01:37:46,731
André, has anyone ever told you

744
01:37:46,898 --> 01:37:50,652
you're the biggest louse in the world?

745
01:37:50,818 --> 01:37:55,156
Heredity. My family was
always known as the biggest louses...

746
01:37:55,323 --> 01:37:57,825
- Lice.
- Lice?

747
01:37:57,992 --> 01:38:00,203
On the Loire.

748
01:38:11,047 --> 01:38:14,008
Pardon. Protocol.

749
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:22,243
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Twins?

750
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:24,620
Tonsils.

751
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,598
Your Highness.

752
01:39:53,524 --> 01:39:57,028
And a visitor to our island paradise...

753
01:39:57,195 --> 01:39:59,197
Your sister Amelia.

754
01:40:30,728 --> 01:40:33,523
Sally.

755
01:40:33,689 --> 01:40:36,025
Amelia.

756
01:40:36,192 --> 01:40:37,902
Sweet.

757
01:40:50,289 --> 01:40:53,417
Well, brother of mine,
what are you so unhappy about?

758
01:40:53,584 --> 01:40:57,255
My pants are too tight. Look.

759
01:41:11,018 --> 01:41:13,271
Thank you.

760
01:41:22,029 --> 01:41:25,825
The Kennedys will be furious.

761
01:41:32,665 --> 01:41:37,461
And as for the Donovans...
Oh, that man!

762
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:48,681
Mademoiselle, look. A miracle.
A new roof for the chapel.

763
01:41:48,848 --> 01:41:53,060
I'm very happy for you, Father.
Miss Lafleur, merry Christmas.

764
01:41:53,227 --> 01:41:58,107
- Oh, thanks.
- And this will amuse you, Mr. Gilhooley.

765
01:41:58,274 --> 01:42:03,904
- And Mr. Donovan?
- He's dressing for the garden party.

766
01:42:09,368 --> 01:42:12,913
- What's all the rush about?
- Mr. Donovan.

767
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:17,334
Of all the selfish, stupid,
evil, poisonous people!

768
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:18,878
- Who?
- You.

769
01:42:19,045 --> 01:42:20,629
- Me?
- Yes.

770
01:42:20,796 --> 01:42:24,925
That's a fine how-do-you-do
on Christmas Day.

771
01:42:25,092 --> 01:42:27,344
How do you think those children feel,

772
01:42:27,511 --> 01:42:30,765
driven out of home
as if their father's ashamed of them?

773
01:42:30,931 --> 01:42:34,060
- You've got this twisted.
- No, I haven't.

774
01:42:34,226 --> 01:42:39,440
You're the one we were worried about.
We didn't know if some old maid...

775
01:42:39,607 --> 01:42:43,360
You turned your nose up
at everybody and everything

776
01:42:43,527 --> 01:42:46,989
until I made
a human being out of you.

777
01:42:47,156 --> 01:42:50,117
- You? Made a human being out?
- Yes.

778
01:42:50,284 --> 01:42:53,037
May I ask how?

779
01:42:53,412 --> 01:42:55,915
Let go of me!

780
01:42:58,876 --> 01:43:03,506
- That's how!
- Oh, you! Old maid!

781
01:43:10,596 --> 01:43:13,432
- Oh, Miss Dedham.
- You're quite welcome.

782
01:43:13,599 --> 01:43:17,228
Tommy, now you've got to marry me!

783
01:43:17,394 --> 01:43:20,648
Sure, baby, sure, sure.

784
01:45:07,504 --> 01:45:11,925
Amelia, aren't you going
to say goodbye to Uncle Guns?

785
01:45:14,678 --> 01:45:20,142
- Mr. Donovan? No, I am not.
- No guts, huh?

786
01:45:29,234 --> 01:45:30,611
Amelia.

787
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,051
Not again.

788
01:45:55,219 --> 01:46:00,015
Michael! Michael Donovan! I...

789
01:46:05,020 --> 01:46:07,064
Did you hurt your... self?

790
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:14,655
You know
I'm leaving for home today?

791
01:46:14,822 --> 01:46:17,157
So I heard.

792
01:46:19,993 --> 01:46:24,248
Michael, if what you said is true,
and if I marry you,

793
01:46:24,414 --> 01:46:30,170
I don't want our children growing up
knowing their father is a saloon-keeper.

794
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:44,601
I gave it to 'em for a wedding present.

795
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:48,313
- Pax?
- Pax.

796
01:46:50,107 --> 01:46:53,277
A marriage made in heaven.

797
01:46:53,443 --> 01:46:56,905
- If I were to consent to marry you...
- If?!

798
01:46:57,072 --> 01:47:00,409
And if we were to have a boy,

799
01:47:00,576 --> 01:47:04,079
he will be called
Francis X Donovan, after my father.

800
01:47:04,246 --> 01:47:08,959
He will be called Sedley Atterbury
Dedham, after my great-uncle.

801
01:47:09,126 --> 01:47:14,548
- That's a hell of a name for a Donovan!
- Michael!

802
01:47:14,715 --> 01:47:18,135
- We'll call him William, after my father.
- After the Doc?

803
01:47:18,302 --> 01:47:21,680
- That's swell. I'll call him Bill.
- Pax?

804
01:47:21,847 --> 01:47:23,640
Pax.

805
01:47:24,349 --> 01:47:29,980
Amelia, you have a mean
Irish temper, but I love it.

806
01:47:30,147 --> 01:47:35,068
From now on,
I wear the pants in this family.

807
01:47:40,991 --> 01:47:43,452
Oh, you...!
