1
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:48,555
THE PACK

2
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,450
Honey, I need to piss,
can you help me?

3
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,263
I can't carry heavy objects.

4
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,038
Shit!

5
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,479
Friends of yours?

6
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,955
You're right, yeah.

7
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,108
May I get in?

8
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,834
I warn you,
if you don't forget about your cock,
you'll get your knuckles rapped.

9
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,868
Don't worry, it's too cold.

10
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,069
Where are we going?

11
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,953
I don't know.
But I'm going towards the sun.

12
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,549
Straight on until
my CDs get finished.

13
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,749
I come from over there,

14
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,793
and I'm going somewhere
over there.

15
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,794
Is there a problem?

16
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,992
Where are you from? The '80s?

17
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,911
Tell me your story.

18
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,800
I love other people's problems.
It's like dope to me.

19
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,955
- Oh yeah?
- Hmm Hmh.

20
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,272
For me, it's when a guy my age
loses his hair.

21
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,559
Oh, damn!

22
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:15,730
Do you know the story
of the masochist,

23
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:16,638
the sodomite, the sadist,

24
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,200
the murderer, the necrophiliac
and the arsonist?

25
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:20,430
No.

26
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,950
In a mental asylum,
a masochist, a sodomite,

27
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,994
a sadist, a murderer, a necrophiliac
and an arsonist are bored.

28
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,030
What?

29
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,798
They are bored.

30
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,430
The sodomite said:
"What if we fucked the cat?"

31
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,158
Then the sadist replies:"Oh yeah!
Let's rape and torture the cat! "

32
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,998
The assassin adds:

33
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,079
"Cool! Let's rape, torture
and kill the cat. "

34
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,511
Then the necrophiliac says, "Oh yeah!

35
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,669
We'll rape, torture and kill the cat,
and then rape her again. "

36
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,156
Then the arsonist said: "Cool!

37
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,746
Let's rape, torture and kill,

38
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:07,608
rape again and then burn the cat. "

39
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,112
Silence. They all look at
the masochist and ask him:

40
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,709
Hey, and you? You say nothing?

41
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,456
The masochist answers:

42
00:09:17,468 --> 00:09:18,718
"Meow. "

43
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,589
- Yeah, not bad.
I knew the story, but with a caribou.

44
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,398
6 hours of bullshit....

45
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,118
I don't want to bother you,

46
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,620
but my dick wants
a girl's butt,

47
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:40,580
and I don't like to keep him waiting!

48
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,950
I'm Bazooka Joe.

49
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,869
And those two are John Grizzly
and Jordan Minnesota.

50
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,437
May we join you?

51
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,196
Wanna dance, sweetie?

52
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,193
Your breath
would curdle the yogurt, honey.

53
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,312
And besides, I don't like the music.

54
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,714
Don't worry.
I just want to feel your ass.

55
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,989
Get lost!

56
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,148
I'm gonna kiss you.

57
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,236
Just try, asshole!

58
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,711
Let me go, shit sack!

59
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,114
Asshole!

60
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,670
Let me go!

61
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,869
I prefer him.

62
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,275
He has a smaller asshole.

63
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,032
Yeah!

64
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,152
I'll fuck him in the ass
in the mouth...

65
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,588
...and under the arms.

66
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,835
You'll crash!

67
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,916
Go!

68
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,010
I want no mess at my place!

69
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,439
Get the fuck out!

70
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,759
Otherwise?

71
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,988
Otherwise, I'll paint my floor
with the juice from your balls.

72
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,188
Funny, right?

73
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,473
Let's go, guys.

74
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,406
Are you OK?

75
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,388
Go ahead. I'll make you collapse.

76
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,796
Damn!

77
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,797
Shit, I'm down to my underwear!

78
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,349
Come on...

79
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,316
Jump!

80
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,197
Are you lost or what?

81
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,069
Damn!

82
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,788
Shit!

83
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,759
Have you seen a guy in the bathroom?
- What?

84
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,714
A guy with long hair,
in the toilet?

85
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,830
No.

86
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,233
Sure you haven't seen him?

87
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,860
I didn't see anybody.

88
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,517
Are you in here?

89
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,272
Are you there?

90
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,030
Jean Jean!

91
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,990
For once, I find someone
who isn't too dumb--

92
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,995
Hey you!

93
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,679
Jean Jean?

94
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,996
He isn't really gone, is he?

95
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,749
You wouldn't be the first girl
abandoned by a guy here.

96
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,317
I saw your very nice
photo wall in the toilet.

97
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,112
What's that door for?

98
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,356
Oh! It's been locked for years.

99
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,755
Shouldn't it be opened?
- No reason to.

100
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,749
We're closed!

101
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,079
Damn!

102
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,033
Is Jean Jean there?

103
00:15:47,035 --> 00:15:48,318
No, no.  Jean Jean's not here.

104
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,039
We had an appointment.
It's called "La Spack" here, right?

105
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,390
Yes.
Yes, but now "La Spack" is closed.

106
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,830
I'm cleaning. Get lost!

107
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,359
Please!

108
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,117
Are you cleaning for a reason?
- Not your business!

109
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,198
Oh, what a jewel!

110
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,910
Is there a problem, Miss?

111
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,395
Can I help you?

112
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,511
At first glance, not much.

113
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,312
You're the sheriff?

114
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,192
Yes. Well, not really.

115
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,476
Now I'm retired.

116
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,911
But if you want some help,
I'm right for the job.

117
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,394
Cool.

118
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,239
Call me Chinaski,
like everyone else.

119
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,749
So what happened?

120
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,951
Well, I lost a friend. Though...

121
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,470
I haven't really lost him,
and he's not really a friend.

122
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,796
He went to the toilet,

123
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,918
and pouff! He disappeared.

124
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,036
You have a relationship with him?

125
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,390
No.
I just gave him a lift.

126
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,238
It's not a good idea

127
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,118
for a girl
to pick-up hitchhikers.

128
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,436
People are nasty nowadays.

129
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,313
They rape everything that moves.
Large, small,

130
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,239
elderly, children,
skinny ones, tall ones--

131
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,316
Fat ones?

132
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,317
Yeah. The fat ones too, yeah...

133
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,193
They rape even corpses
hanging from the ceiling!

134
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,392
The range of possibilities is vast,
miss.

135
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,318
I know, yeah...

136
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,398
Is the fellow... is he an adult?

137
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,352
Of course he's an adult!

138
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,075
Well, I can't do anything for you.

139
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,474
I'm surprised.

140
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,591
When an adult disappears,

141
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,233
you can't do anything.

142
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,953
That is The Law!

143
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,991
Great laws we have!

144
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,395
And if his corpse reappears
floating on the surface of a canal?

145
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,910
<i>You overreact.
Give me your name and
phone number.</i>

146
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,793
<i>- Charlotte Massot. MAS--
- Wait, wait!</i>

147
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,189
MASSOT, Charlotte.

148
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,276
Charlotte...

149
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,879
Char-lot-te.

150
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,035
Phone?

151
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,835
06-1 4-81-1000.

152
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,069
1000...

153
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,279
OK.

154
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,279
Goodbye, miss.

155
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,391
Oh, la la, what a jewel!

156
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,348
Shit!

157
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,753
- I can spot small cuties
like her, from miles away.

158
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,509
Here. You take my place
in the shed with the rest.

159
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,752
So, my little darling?

160
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,599
Too bad you came back!

161
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,119
That's my boy?

162
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,799
Huh?

163
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,391
Do you like my boy, huh?

164
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,510
Hmm... ?

165
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,639
Here.

166
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,273
John Wayne, John Wayne...

167
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,799
- You should eat,
my 'little heart.'

168
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,592
It's not appetizing,

169
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,119
but it's rich in iron.

170
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,115
Here...

171
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,278
...you'll need it!

172
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,277
A good yum yum!

173
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,470
He wasn't well prepared,
that one.

174
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,678
OK then?

175
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,678
Go...

176
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,956
Well, anyway!

177
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,029
Go...

178
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,391
<i>John Wayne...</i>

179
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:20,307
<i>John Wayne...
John Wayne...
John Wayne...</i>

180
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,679
Hey, you!

181
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,389
Ho!

182
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,672
Hey, you! Untie me!

183
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,758
John Wayne can't help,
idiot, untie me!

184
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,029
Look!

185
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,429
Come on!

186
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,153
Hurry!

187
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:02,152
Ahh, Shit!

188
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,437
Hey, John Wayne,
let's see what you can do.

189
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,393
Ah, yeah,
John Wayne! John Wayne!

190
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,397
C'mon, c'mon--

191
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,755
Go!

192
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,519
Yes... Yes!

193
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,994
Go ahead, shoot!

194
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,475
Shhh!

195
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:35,370
Yes!

196
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:05,268
Yes.

197
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,035
<i>You take care of the stuff--</i>

198
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,389
Shit!

199
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,179
<i>Go ahead.</i>

200
00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:24,124
<i>I'll take care of it here.</i>

201
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,151
I practiced catching
in my younger years.

202
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,318
You must be pretty
good to get one on me.

203
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,794
Move!

204
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,433
Hello?

205
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,596
Hello...

206
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,831
You won't do this again.
Tomorrow's your time for the chair.

207
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,437
John Wayne,
John Wayne...

208
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,238
Is there a problem
with the toilet?

209
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,236
Yeah.

210
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,318
There was a brawl
with a couple of bikers.

211
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,318
So if we want to....
Go outside?

212
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,590
Well, yeah. No choice.

213
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,276
Yeah...

214
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,157
Until tomorrow, Jean Jean.
I beat your score.

215
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,394
Uh...

216
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,912
I talked with a Miss
Charlotte Massot.

217
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,714
She reported
the disappearance of a friend.

218
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,875
Really?

219
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,950
Yes. She came from your place.

220
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,036
When?

221
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,915
Last Saturday.

222
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,315
On the weekends,
my mother is here.

223
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,555
Ah...

224
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,115
You'll have to
ask her yourself.

225
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,072
Is she here?
- No.

226
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,956
She takes care of the farm.

227
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,755
He doesn't look very well.

228
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,191
There was a cop in the bar.

229
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,750
He asked lots of questions.

230
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,118
Who cares about that old fart?

231
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,469
Go and take care of the new ones.

232
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,473
They won't be long now.

233
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,749
I like the little girl.

234
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,110
She's nice.

235
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,073
She's really pretty.

236
00:42:47,116 --> 00:42:48,589
I'm talking to you!

237
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,110
She hasn't always been like that,
you know.

238
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,199
When my brothers died,
she became crazy.

239
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,674
The authorities preferred
to let them die in the mine,

240
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,599
rather than risk the possibility
of a gas blast.

241
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,271
We can't do anything against them.

242
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,352
The village people
talked about creatures...

243
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,358
...born of mud and the blood of the dead.

244
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,632
Miners were killed underground.

245
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,992
We laughed a lot about that,
I can tell you.

246
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,589
It's really weird
who they chose, you know.

247
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,477
We dug too deep, I think.

248
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,913
My mother says that
the earth wants blood,

249
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,793
and we have no right
to refuse.

250
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,748
Bonjour, Madame!

251
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,712
Oh, my God!

252
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,434
Pardon.
I did not want to scare you.

253
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:46,935
It's OK.
It's only that I get
so few visitors these days.

254
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:49,675
What can I do for you?

255
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,476
I want you to tell me
about Charlotte Massot.

256
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,589
Don't know anything.

257
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,676
But if--

258
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,759
I met her in your yard,
not long ago.

259
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,279
Yes, I remember her well...

260
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,790
...pretty little things like her,
don't come around here very often.

261
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,560
Oh yes...

262
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,750
small, dark-haired?
- Yes.

263
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,918
Pretty girl.
- Yes.

264
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:20,359
It may be that something
has happened to her.

265
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,869
What makes you say that?

266
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,671
How about coming in for 5 minutes?

267
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,155
You're standing there looking lost,
and I've forgotten my manners!

268
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,512
Sit down.

269
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,150
Thank you.

270
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,828
I'll make a coffee for you.

271
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,072
Although my road--

272
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,317
They're just out there, huh?

273
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,192
All right, all right!

274
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,434
You took me for a coward, eh?

275
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,037
But frankly,
I don't blame you.

276
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,797
OK. Come here.

277
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,869
Come here...

278
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,759
I told you it wasn't safe
to give a lift to hitchhikers.

279
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,113
Come.

280
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,918
Give me a good reason
not to shoot you.

281
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,032
I don't know one.

282
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,389
You?

283
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,872
I'll kill them all!

284
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,895
What are you looking for?
-Maybe we have a chance!

285
00:53:37,897 --> 00:53:40,440
They stay below
when the moon is descending.

286
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:52,115
<i>Hidden in the earth!
It sends its monsters to us!</i>

287
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,431
We have to go back to the heap.

288
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,712
They can live
below the ground.

289
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,835
Well 'La Spack'?

290
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,389
Laughing any less now?

291
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,998
You fat slut!

292
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,671
This isn't the day to quit smoking.

293
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,637
Chinaski? Chinaski!

294
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,912
Forget it.
We gotta be there before nightfall.

295
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,758
Chinaski!

296
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,914
Ha!

297
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,318
Look what I found!
- Perfect timing.

298
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,315
We're lucky!
- We're what?

299
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,431
I wanted to fuck this little slut.

300
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,755
That's right!

301
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,230
It's a mania!
- Yeah, but I like it.

302
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,479
The old Spack!

303
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,148
Oh, damn!

304
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,353
She sucks!
Why did she 
throw this head at us?

305
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,075
We're going to fuck her,
or shall we start with you?

306
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:06,117
What's this crap?

307
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,117
We must barricade ouselves.

308
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,673
We must barricade ourselves!

309
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,517
Tonight, she'll let them out,
and they'll kill us all.

310
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,153
Out? Let who out?

311
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,952
Believe me,
you don't wanna know.

312
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,229
You gonna believe me?

313
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,716
We'll have to break out guys.
Do you hear me, you bitches?

314
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,272
You, shut up!

315
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,837
The old one is kidding with us, 
and we're just trembling like empty cans.

316
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,593
What's that?

317
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,429
It was my father's.
He did shooting competitions.

318
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,665
Well, you're well equipped!
- Should be enough until dawn.

319
01:00:12,787 --> 01:00:14,690
Does she always wear 
the metal mesh?

320
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,872
She never takes off
her coat of mail, yeah.

321
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,954
Hey!

322
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,518
Max!
Get out of there!

323
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,519
The girl has confused you, huh?

324
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,153
It's a 50", granny, you like it?

325
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,869
You really have a problem, you know?

326
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,469
When I shoot you,
you have to yell!

327
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,116
Come on, once more!

328
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,197
Even on this side of the barrel...

329
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,153
...you're still the same...

330
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,839
...jerk mouth!

331
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,153
You've got a large mouth
for a crazy old bitch!

332
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,635
You're so crazy, that you don't even
know when you're being fucked!

333
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,550
It's you who's fucked!

334
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,516
What's that crap?

335
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,509
She wants blood...the earth...

336
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,438
I'll give it to her myself.

337
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,389
Holy shit!

338
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,635
Damn!

339
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,479
That son of a bitch!

340
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:01,998
Do you want to hear
a funny story?

341
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,194
- Yes.
- Yeah?

342
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,756
Do you know the story of
the masochist, the sodomite...

343
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:11,111
...the necrophiliac, the sadist
the arsonist and the murderer?

344
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,356
- No.
- No?

345
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,074
It's really funny.

346
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,510
I'm going to piss,
and then I'll tell you the story.
