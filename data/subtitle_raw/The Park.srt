1
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,454
- Hello there, boys and girls.

2
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,490
Recently you may have noticed
some changes in your bodies.

3
00:00:24,626 --> 00:00:27,662
But don't worry, these
changes are perfectly normal.

4
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:31,533
What's happening to
you is called puberty.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,637
It's the process of changing
from a child into an adult.

6
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,040
- Deaths have been reported
in cities around the world.

7
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,844
Back to you-

8
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,779
- This ain't from
nature, people.

9
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,748
This is a man-made
biological weapon.

10
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,850
- The scale of which
we have never seen

11
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,753
and every adult is at risk.

12
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:55,690
- It appears the
disease has no effect

13
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,124
on prepubescent children.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,496
However, when infected
children reach puberty,

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,732
the effects of the
disease will be fatal.

16
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:08,268
- It may seem strange,
uncomfortable,

17
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:09,571
even unpleasant at times,

18
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:13,173
but it happens to each
and every one of us.

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,377
- Let us pray for our children,

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,682
for soon we will be gone

21
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:23,718
and they will have to
suffer this plague alone.

22
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,473
- We're not gonna make it!

23
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:48,108
Yes we are! Hooah!

24
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:17,904
- Cute backpack.

25
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:20,641
Bring it here.

26
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,510
- Come and get it.

27
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:27,381
- Ah, ah. I got this.

28
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,751
Look, buddy, there's two
ways this can go down.

29
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,318
The easy way, or...

30
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,790
What am I saying?

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,828
Nothing is world
is fucking easy!

32
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,941
- He cut you?

33
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,910
- I'm solid.

34
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,483
- Tell me he's got water.

35
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,453
I'd kill for something
with bubbles.

36
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,426
Shit, man.

37
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:22,703
What's with you?

38
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,308
Think it's funny?

39
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,311
Starving to death in
the fucking woods?

40
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,344
- Shh!

41
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,317
Listen.

42
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,595
You hear that?

43
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,383
- Where are we?

44
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,896
This place ain't on the map.

45
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,867
We should skip it. We
gotta find that genius.

46
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
- Wait.

47
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:29,670
They've got water.

48
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:33,508
But they're packing heat.

49
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,343
Heavy.

50
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,648
- Water?

51
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,417
They got a whole ocean!

52
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:49,456
♪ You never want to hurt
the one who loves you ♪

53
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,035
So.

54
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,670
What's our move here?

55
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,640
- It's my move.

56
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,010
You're staying on recon.

57
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,378
- Boring!

58
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,016
- Lay low and suss out the area.

59
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,449
This is just a pit stop.

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,556
- Wait. You're leaving me here?

61
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,589
Alone?

62
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,593
In Blue Meanie territory?

63
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,602
I heard they found
geezers around here.

64
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,903
Wrapped in blue plastic.

65
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,105
Throats cut open.

66
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:42,442
Like pigs.

67
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,614
- Don't be a pussy.

68
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,382
I'll back with a tasty
treat just for you.

69
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:51,953
Don't lose that.

70
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,891
Scared of a ghost story.

71
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:57,959
- I ain't scared!

72
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:00,794
It ain't no story.

73
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,030
- Mm-hmm.

74
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,457
- Halt!

75
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,490
Who's there?

76
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,461
- Water!

77
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,494
Please.

78
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,006
Meet me in three. By
the jazz swingers.

79
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,143
- Jazz swingers?

80
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,169
Thank you.

81
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:17,838
It's been rough out there.

82
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:24,578
I'm headed north.
Town called Derby.

83
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Heard of it?

84
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,630
They say there's
like some kid genius

85
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,827
who made a vaccine or something.

86
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,763
It's probably just a rumor,
but I'm still gonna go look...

87
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,032
- Are you alone?

88
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,303
You sure?

89
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:54,642
I hate surprises.

90
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,910
- Yes.

91
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:03,050
- I'm just playing.

92
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:06,053
I love surprises. You're
coming from the city, right?

93
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:08,189
I heard kids over there
be going, like, crazy,

94
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,825
like full-on Mad
Max and whatnot.

95
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,127
My mom was from there.
Where are you from?

96
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,128
- I'm from- - Oh!

97
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,796
Guess what I'm working on?

98
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,732
Bet you money you can't guess.

99
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,668
Not that money matters anymore.

100
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:24,171
I'm sorry, I just get really
excited when I meet new people.

101
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:27,174
Oh, speaking of surprises, I
need to show you something.

102
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,944
My project, Al-Shifa.

103
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,647
You're gonna bug out. It's
literally gonna change the world.

104
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,749
Can you walk on that?

105
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,585
- Sorta.

106
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:41,155
- Great. Here, let
me get that for you.

107
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,124
- Hands up and don't move.

108
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,798
All of your shit? It's mine now.

109
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,666
So be a doll and
gather it up for me

110
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,101
and I'll be on my merry way.

111
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,338
- Whose blood is that?

112
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,740
- The last fucker who
didn't do as they were told.

113
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,311
Hold still!

114
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:10,151
One more step and I toast you.

115
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:11,852
I'm for real, this aint a game.

116
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,624
- Sure it is.

117
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,896
- Kids these days.

118
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,737
- Wow!

119
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,306
You were really gonna
ice me just like that.

120
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:34,374
You cold-blooded.

121
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,314
Tell you what.

122
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,184
Apologize and maybe I'll
still show you my project.

123
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,986
- Back the fuck off!

124
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,354
Hey, Bui!

125
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,190
- Okay, you know what?

126
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:51,192
Now you're starting
to piss me off.

127
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,028
- Ow!

128
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,061
Ow! Ow!

129
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,299
Ow!

130
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:31,364
Please.

131
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,634
No. No more shots.

132
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:35,870
No!

133
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,138
Stop!

134
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,273
Don't! I'm not sick anymore!

135
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,674
Get off of me!

136
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,410
Stop! Stop!

137
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,312
Stop! Ow!

138
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,348
- Idiot!

139
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,382
Hold still!

140
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:11,872
- Kid.

141
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:12,940
Kid!

142
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:15,009
- My name is Kuan.

143
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,445
And I bet we're,
like, the same age.

144
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,383
Okay.

145
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,420
This is going to hurt,
but you're a dingus.

146
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,355
And you sorta deserve it.

147
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,423
- Ow!

148
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,997

149
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:59,153

someone to love me ♪

150

- Dinner.

154
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:17,371
- This smells like
actual garbage.

155
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,906
Wait! Sorry.

These are mine, girl.

160
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,494
- Ines.

161
00:12:42,496 --> 00:12:43,897
- What?

162
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,100
- Ines. That's my
name, it's French.

163
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,148
It's clear tonight.

164
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:07,522
- Dormir a la belle etoile.

165
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,992
That's French for
"to sleep under-"

166
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:14,128
- Je sais. Tu parles francais?

167
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,098
- Oh. Uh, no.

168
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,835
Not really. My mom taught me.

169
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,572
She knew, like, 20 languages.

170
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,242
Wanted to learn 'em all.
Even at the very end.

171
00:13:31,513 --> 00:13:33,023
You should've seen her
in her hospital bed

172
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:36,450
with like all of her phrasebooks
stacked up around her.

173
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,521
Counting to 10 in Indonesian.

174
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:40,555
Satu.

175
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:42,189
Dua.

176
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,457
Tiga.

177
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:57,338
- Kuan, why are you helping me?

178
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:05,079
- The way I see it is that
we're helping each other.

179
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,548
My project, it's...

180
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,283
It's like a football game.

181
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,352
I need a team. I
can't do it alone.

182
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,420
Unless I threw the ball
really high to myself.

183
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,590
Or made little cardboard
team cutout people and-

184
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:16,623
- What project?

185
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,529
- You ever heard of Al-Shifa?

186
00:14:29,637 --> 00:14:33,407
It's this ancient Persian
book. It means "The Healing."

187
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,678
Now, I'm not religious, really,

188
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:38,546
but they say that
if you can recite

189
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,648
all of Al-Shifa to a sick man,

190
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:43,283
he will be cured like that.

191
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,487
So that's what I'm building.

192
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,355
That's my project. Hold this.

193
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:53,260
- You're making a cure?

194
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:55,361
- Yep.

195
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:57,664
- I knew it!

196
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,435
You're the kid genius! You're
the one I've been looking for!

197
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,541
- You can't cure the virus.

198
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:09,243
That's literally impossible.

199
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:13,013
My cure is for something else.

200
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,652
- Wait, then you're
not- - Watch this.

201
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:22,089
I am a golden god...

202
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,991
Or not.

203
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,024
Dang it.

204
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,663
- Wait, so what are
you curing then?

205
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,297
- Well, it's like...

206
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,402
Did you believe in Santa
Claus when you were younger?

207
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,571
- Of course.

208
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:39,574
- Right, so when you're a kid,

209
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,075
you believe in the impossible.

210
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,111
But then you grow up

211
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,615
and the world teaches
you that it's not true.

212
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,584
You stop believing.

213
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,657
But what if the world is wrong?

214
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,228
- The fuck are
you talking about?

215
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,630
Have you see the world today?

216
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,567
The twisted shit these kids
are doing to each other?

217
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,503
It's a sickness! We're
all sick, inside and out.

218
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:10,781
I'm sorry, but you're
weird and I'm confused

219
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,240
and this all just seems
like a huge waste of time!

220
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,475
Which, if you hadn't noticed,

221
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,043
that is in short
supply these days!

222
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,076
And I want...

223
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,179
I, I...

224
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:22,717
- What do you want?

225
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,218
- I...

226
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,251
I...

227
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:27,689
Bui, don't!

228
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,330
- Big mistake!

229
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,601
You guys are dead!

230
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,739
- She hurt you?

231
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:06,293
- We gotta take her out.

232
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,579
What the fuck?

233
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:17,799
Bui!

234
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,266
Shit!

235
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,917
- Faster.

236
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:49,423
You know, I had a,
like, perfect plan

237
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,834
before you and your
butthole friend came

238
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,292
and mucked everything up.

239
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:54,961
Now I'm not so sure.

240
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,634
I mean, maybe you're right.

241
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:03,236
Maybe I got this
world all wrong.

242
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:08,275
I mean, shit, we're
gonna die anyway, right?

243
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,308
Why waste time?

244
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:13,581
Why not kill each other?

245
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:19,052
Move.

246
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:28,963
What do you see?

247
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:35,536
- A moldy old slide.

248
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,871
Wrong.

249
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,808
You're only what's
right in front of you.

250
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,245
You have an imagination,
don't you, dummy?

251
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
So use it.

252
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:51,451
See what this place could be.

253
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,857
What we could share with
everyone that's left.

254
00:20:57,892 --> 00:20:58,892
Look.

255
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,007
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

256
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:18,745
No!

257
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,628
Can we do that again?

258
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:08,996
- Yeah!

259
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,819
- As we go through puberty,

260
00:23:04,852 --> 00:23:07,054
we start to notice
changes in our bodies.

261
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:09,090
Our voices start
to sound different.

262
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:11,859
See, there's an
organ in your throat

263
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,494
called the larynx, or voice box.

264
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:17,999
During puberty your larynx
grows thicker and larger.

265
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:20,467
Boys will notice their
voice becoming deeper.

266
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,536
Girls will too,
but only a little.

267
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:25,973
So buckle up because
puberty is taking you

268
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:28,109
on the bumpy road to adulthood.

269
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:36,584
- Relax, Scarface.

270
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:39,086
The first kill is
always the hardest.

271
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,189
It'll get much easier with
a little more practice.

272
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:45,492
And cheer up. You're
this week's champion!

273
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:48,996
You just made my new squad.

274
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,131
Here's your uniform.

275
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,707
Scarface, don't go
crybaby on me now.

276
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:03,062
You wanna be part of my
squad, you better man up.

277
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,747
- Hey! Get over here!

278
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,056
Hurry up! Faster!

279
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,634
- Fucking bitch.

280
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:10,878
- Where did you
learn to do that?

281
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:13,748
You're a freaking fish ninja.

282
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:14,781
- YouTube.

283
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,124
- You see what
I'm seeing, right?

284
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:24,325
- Hell yes.

285
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:27,695
A little salt, some chili
oil, and we got us a tasty...

286
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,597
- Hands off Carpe Diem!

287
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:32,933
Have a little vision. This
is only the beginning.

288
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:36,137
We get your gigantic
friend to help us,

289
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,972
we stock this place
full of specimens,

290
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:39,206
make sure the rides and slides

291
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,976
are spic and span and up
and running, and boom!

292
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:44,245
We are the proud owners

293
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:48,049
of the best theme park slash
aquatic entertainment center

294
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:49,884
in the world.

295
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:50,918
- Best and only.

296
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:02,997
Huh! Fuck me.

297
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,835
So why carry a fake gun
when you got the real thing?

298
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:13,941
- Never let the enemy know
the true power of your forces.

299
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,245
Art of War.

300
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:23,217
Sunny Zoo wrote that.

301
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:29,256
- It's Sun Tzu, not Sunny Zoo.

302
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,624
And he never said that.

303
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,095
- It was Tom Cruise then.

304
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,632
Say, what do you think
happened to the zoos?

305
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,177
Do you think all the
animals ate each other?

306
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:42,369
Or did some of them escape
and start toasting people?

307
00:26:42,403 --> 00:26:45,773
What would you rather fight?
A lion or a Blue Meanie?

308
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,908
- A Blue Meanie. 'Cause
they aren't real.

309
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,177
- They are too real.

310
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:02,223
We're on the same
team now, right?

311
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:11,332
And you're going to put
your genius hunt on hold

312
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:12,933
and help me with Al-Shifa.

313
00:27:16,036 --> 00:27:17,304
Don't lie!

314
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,874
I can see if you're lying.

315
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,042
- Bullshit you can.

316
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,119
- Wait!

317
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,400
Wow.

318
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,969
You just, like, saved my life.

319
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,172
- This guy's not poisonous.

320
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,485
- Are too real!

321
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,920
- Dude!

322
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,721
The Blue Meanies were
made up by some kingpin

323
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:10,424
to freak his squad out
and keep 'em in line.

324
00:28:10,457 --> 00:28:11,292
Trust me, it's what I do.

325
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:14,195
Only I'd come up
with a better name.

326
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:16,197
- You ain't got no squad.

327
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,831
- I used to.

328
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,733
- What happened to 'em?

329
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,937
- What do you think? They
were two grades ahead.

330
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,272
They went geezer a while back.

331
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:27,241
Bui and I are all that's left.

332
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,475
- Oh. I'm sorry.

333
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,013
- Don't be. No one's
gonna miss those pricks.

334
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:38,118
- I wish I had a squad.
All I got is stupid Luka.

335
00:28:39,787 --> 00:28:41,355
- Who?
- Luka, my brother.

336
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:44,858
He's a real pain in my ass.

337
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,804
I mean, he was supposed to
re-up on water from the river.

338
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,540
I'm sure he's out there
somewhere just, like,

339
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:51,865
playing with little
cars or something.

340
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,033
I mean, this kid...

341
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,905
Earth to Ines!

342
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:00,074
- Sorry. What was...

343
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:02,443
- I said did you happen to
see Luka on your way in?

344
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,213
- Sorry.

345
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:28,495
- What a little fuckin' pussy.

346
00:30:31,198 --> 00:30:32,199
- Easy, tiger.

347
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:34,435
- Took you long enough.

348
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,416
- If you played nice with
her for like two seconds,

349
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,474
she'd let you go.

350
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,177
- When do we play nice?

351
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,479
Don't get it, man.

352
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:48,516
Shit here's all backwards.

353
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,890
Shit!
- Chill!

354
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,158
She won't see us.

355
00:30:58,192 --> 00:30:59,561
- Ugh.

356
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:01,862
She's crazy and tone-deaf.

357
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,566
Yo, we're wasting time here.

358
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,034
We gotta get moving and
find that genius already.

359
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:10,538
You wanna go full geezer
in this shithole or what?

360
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,940
- So just lie to her.
Say you're sorry.

361
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,175
- I ain't like you.

362
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:19,345
I ain't a liar.

363
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:23,618
- You're a pain in my
ass is what you are.

364
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:28,989
- Wait.

365
00:31:29,022 --> 00:31:30,558
- I got the wrong key.

366
00:31:30,592 --> 00:31:34,161
- Since day one I've done
like you've always said.

367
00:31:34,194 --> 00:31:35,663
I might not be clever like you,

368
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:38,298
but I can see what's
in front of my face.

369
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:40,401
And I'm telling you, that girl,

370
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:42,570
she ain't us.

371
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:44,605
- Bui.

372
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:46,974
Let me go!

373
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,588
- She fucking stabbed me!

374
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:37,291
What are you all standing
around for? Do something!

375
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:38,693
One of you get her!

376
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:41,361
I'm your goddamn leader!

377
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:42,530
Oh shit.

378
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:44,732
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

379
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:51,639
- The king is dead. Long
live the motherfucking queen!

380
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:57,010
From now on you do what
I say, when I say it,

381
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:58,045
or you get toasted.

382
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:00,414
We crystal on that?

383
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,017
Lovely.

384
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:06,487
First things first:
no more of this.

385
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,568
We shouldn't be
fighting each other.

386
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:12,326
This aint' fuckin'
"Hunger Games."

387
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:18,666
We stick together and we keep
the system nice and binary.

388
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:28,175
There are two kinds of people.

389
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,678
There's us and there's them.

390
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,782
And if you ain't us,
well, then tough titty.

391
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,487
What do you say?

392
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:41,823
Bui?

393
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:42,856
Us?

394
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:44,791
Or them?

395
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:55,602
Wait! I...

396
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:57,738
I give up!

397
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,743
You win! Stop, please!

398
00:34:22,162 --> 00:34:24,799
This is your last chance.

399
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:26,801
Concentrate.

400
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:28,702
Make it count.

401
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,839
Ho-ho-ho!

402
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,543
C'est dommage.

403
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:36,577
So close.

404
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,682
Hey! You only get three tries!

405
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:49,857
You know, cheaters
only cheat themselves.

406
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:50,891
Silly girl.

407
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,805
Aw, snap. It's chow time.

408
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,841

garbage-ass stew ever again.

422
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:10,838
- Not really.

This is Carpe Diem.

430
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:40,868
I loved that fish.

431
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,540
- And it's not your fish.

432
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:47,842
It's Severus Snake.

433
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:50,845
- Not cool!

434
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,548
What the heck kind of name
is Severus Snake anyway?

435
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:54,481
That's like not even...

436
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:55,382
Oh, wait.

437
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:57,685
No, I get it.

438
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,496

Ines, how come you
know so many words?

445
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:37,525
- I read a lot. Like your mom.

446
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:40,828
- You were sick too?

447
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:41,862
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,266
- So tell me about it.

449
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:49,369
- Uh, I don't now.

450
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:53,741
I spent a lot of
time in the hospital.

451
00:37:53,775 --> 00:37:56,010
There was no one to talk
to. I was bored as shit.

452
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,549
- Where were your parents?

453
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:04,317
- I never met them.

454
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:08,022
So I read.

455
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:10,024
A lot.

456
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:15,530
My favorites were the stories
with disasters and monsters

457
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:16,931
where everyone dies at the end.

458
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:23,771
I started imagining what I'd
do if that ever happened to me.

459
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:29,076
And then I started, like,
researching what to do.

460
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,114
And the more I read,

461
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,382
the more I started to
believe it was all real.

462
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,455
And it sounds nuts,

463
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,634
but it was almost
like I was waiting

464
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:44,926
for the end of the world.

465
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,596
So that when it finally
came, I was ready.

466
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:52,432
Although I was hoping there
would be some zombies.

467
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,369
- There's Blue Meanies.
- Shut up and pull it.

468
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,646
- Aw, man, that's it?
It looks terrible!

469
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,116
I spend like so
long working on...

470
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:11,585
You did it!

471
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:19,459

00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:20,995

487
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:27,028
- What are you talking about?

488
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:29,897
- Don't play stupid with me.

489
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,601
- Just keeping it on your level.

490
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:37,138
- Why you always
ragging on me? Huh?

491
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,774

be so nice to her

492
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:41,776
and such a dickhole to me?

493
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:42,853
Is it 'cause I know the real you

494
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:45,613
and not this fake-ass
character you're playing?

495
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:46,646
Is that it?

496
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:51,652
It's like, what if she knew
you toasted her little friend?

497
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,655
Would you still be
all BFF then? Huh?

498
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:59,994
- For two years I've kept your
dead-weight bitch-ass alive!

499
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:02,163
Remind me why I bother.

500
00:41:04,532 --> 00:41:07,168
- I wasn't gonna tell
her nothing! I swear!

501
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:08,936
Ines! Ines, wait!

502
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,073
Shit!

503
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:19,206
- He's gone. Isn't he?

504
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:22,043
- Kuan, I gotta
tell you something-

505
00:42:22,076 --> 00:42:26,947
- You know, every time
this happens, it gets...

506
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:31,619
Easier to say goodbye and...

507
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,301
Just like that, you
start to forget.

508
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:51,038
I don't want to be forgotten.

509
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:55,943
I don't want this place
to just disappear.

510
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:59,080
I want us, all of us,

511
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:00,714
to build it, together.

512
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:04,251
To remind everyone that's
left what this world could be.

513
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,153
What it should be.

514
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:20,301
And I believe in that.

515
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:24,271
In this place. It can save us.

516
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:29,743
I'm not crazy for
thinking that, am I?

517
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:35,049
- Oh, you're definitely crazy.

518
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:43,224
But you're right
about this place.

519
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:45,859
It's...

520
00:43:46,961 --> 00:43:47,962
It's really special.

521
00:43:54,201 --> 00:43:55,136
What?

522
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:57,771
- You have, like, some
paint on your face.

523
00:43:57,805 --> 00:43:59,807
- Ow! Be gentle.

524
00:44:48,322 --> 00:44:49,322
- Ines!

525
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:09,143
It's time for us
to go. Right now.

526
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:12,413
- Bui- - Me or her!

527
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:17,318
Who's it gonna be?

528
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:20,387
- Big guy, you need
to take a chill pill.

529
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:22,489
- Move.

530
00:45:23,424 --> 00:45:24,992
- Bui, no!

531
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:26,227
- Oh, you're dead!

532
00:45:27,328 --> 00:45:29,096
- Guys! Stop!

533
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:35,269
Ow!

534
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:38,038
- You okay?

535
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:46,447
- Ow!

536
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:57,023
- This was Luka's.

537
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
You!

538
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:05,466
No.

539
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:09,902
It was you.

540
00:46:11,972 --> 00:46:14,008
Yeah. Of course it was.

541
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:15,151
- Kuan, please. I didn't know.

542
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:18,178
- Should've seen it right away.

543
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:20,180
But I saw something in you.

544
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:22,416
You were different.

545
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:24,484
You were good!

546
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:30,491
I'm so fucking stupid!

547
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,362
Now you have 10 seconds
to get out of here

548
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:38,465
before I'm back with a
bullet for each of you.

549
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:39,500
You killers.

550
00:46:40,968 --> 00:46:41,968
You fucks!

551
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,539
You don't belong here!

552
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:48,876
You'll never be cured.

553
00:46:50,444 --> 00:46:51,478
And you'll die.

554
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:57,217
And you'll rot.

555
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:00,588
And you'll be forgotten.

556
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:04,057
- Kuan!

557
00:47:05,025 --> 00:47:07,161
Kuan!

558
00:47:07,194 --> 00:47:08,194
Kuan!

559
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:11,498
Kuan!

560
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,067
No, Kuan!

561
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:18,472
No, Kuan!

562
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:19,541
Please!

563
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:30,618
- Shit!

564
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:32,554
Shit.

565
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:35,657
Come on, we gotta go! Come on!

566
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:40,127
We gotta get those gats.

567
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,463
Where's that cabinet? Come on!

568
00:47:42,496 --> 00:47:44,898
- But the Blue Meanies,
they're not real!

569
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,566
Bui!

570
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:50,290
Bui.

571
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:52,059
Stop.

572
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:55,195
- Gotta keep...
- Dammit, let me down!

573
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,501
- Ines, we gotta...

574
00:50:01,669 --> 00:50:02,737
We gotta keep going.

575
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,171
- There's no we.

576
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,675
And there never was.

577
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:10,277
There's you and there's me.

578
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:14,716
So go. Keep off the trails
and you can make it.

579
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:18,753
- Ines.

580
00:50:19,787 --> 00:50:20,787
Fuck you.

581
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:33,493
They're close.

582
00:51:34,562 --> 00:51:35,562
Shit.

583
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:01,254
Come on, you gotta
eat something.

584
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:03,890
Shit.

585
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:06,928
- Put me down.

586
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,763
- Ines- - I need to see this!

587
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:09,796
- Okay!

588
00:52:10,798 --> 00:52:11,799
Chill.

589
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:18,773
- His throat.

590
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:21,809
Looks like it's smiling.

591
00:52:30,718 --> 00:52:31,886
- Come on.

592
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:32,919
Creep.

593
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,725
Good news. 10 miles.

594
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:12,759
Derby's up the road.

595
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:16,531
If we hustle tomorrow
we can find your genius.

596
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:22,469
- There's no genius.

597
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:25,505
No cure.

598
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,812
She was the only one
who understood that.

599
00:53:34,816 --> 00:53:37,985
And even still, she
built all of that...

600
00:53:38,986 --> 00:53:40,220
Al-Shifa.

601
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,425
What a useless thing to do.

602
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:57,471
I never got to say goodbye.

603
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:22,388
- Leave it.

604
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:25,992
We need to keep on.

605
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,865
You want it? You want it?

606
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:40,641
I'm sick and tired of
this crybaby routine.

607
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:42,643
It ain't you.

608
00:55:45,813 --> 00:55:46,981
Snap out of it!

609
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:52,053
Ines!

610
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:53,988
Ines, for real!

611
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:59,827
You can barely swim!

612
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,076
- You can't swim at all!

613
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:23,117
You wanted me to choose!

614
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,720
I would've taken Kuan!

615
00:56:25,753 --> 00:56:26,753
Not you!

616
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:30,725
- Think you're so
fucking smart...

617
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:33,694
But you don't know
dick about shit!

618
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:38,866
Family ain't
something you choose.

619
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,134
- Family?

620
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,836
- You can't stop me!

621
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:44,805
You and me? We're family!

622
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,440
You can't...

623
00:56:48,142 --> 00:56:49,577
You can't...

624
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,712
And you can't change
that, you stupid...

625
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:53,014
Stupid asshole!

626
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:55,215
- Bui!

627
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,087
Bui! Shit!

628
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:20,874
No!

629
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:24,878
Wake up!

630
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:47,634
No!

631
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:06,520
- What a little fuckin' pussy.

632
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:09,556
- Hey, kid.

633
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:14,895
Word of advice? Never
let them see you cry.

634
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:23,070
See you around, kid.

635
00:58:28,676 --> 00:58:29,977
No! No!

636
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:31,011
Fuck this!

637
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,680
Get up!

638
00:58:35,116 --> 00:58:38,219
There's work to do and
you're not finished yet!

639
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:39,587
I need you, Bui!

640
00:58:40,688 --> 00:58:42,089
So if you know
what's good for you,

641
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:44,592
you better take
a fucking breath!

642
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,127
Right fucking now!

643
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,098
Please!

644
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:52,333
Oh my god!

645
00:58:58,272 --> 00:59:00,307
- Did you try to kiss me?

646
00:59:01,175 --> 00:59:02,209
Ow.

647
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,949
- Don't ever do that again.

648
00:59:33,674 --> 00:59:35,910
- This is all I could find.

649
00:59:37,278 --> 00:59:38,278
What's your move here?

650
00:59:40,114 --> 00:59:41,114
- Our move.

651
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:46,654
We're done running.
It's time to hunt.

652
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:50,257
You'll be the bait.

653
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:51,358
- Wait. Wait, what?

654
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:53,393
- Trust me.

655
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:56,964

01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:41,301
Well, fuck me.

668
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:56,550
Hey, freak!

669
01:01:58,352 --> 01:02:01,722
Drop it or I open her up like
a fucking Christmas present.

670
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:06,794
Let my friend go.

671
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:13,534
You okay?

672
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:15,501
- Solid.

673
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,446
- Blue Meanies my ass.

674
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:27,982
Look at you losers. You
ain't nothin' scary.

675
01:02:30,117 --> 01:02:32,019
You're just a
couple of stupid...

676
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,261
Stupid kids.

677
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,339
- The hell are you doing?

678
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:53,373
- Let 'em go.

679
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,375
Trust me.

680
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:02,416
- We can't just leave them.

681
01:03:03,284 --> 01:03:05,352
- Sure we can. They're smart.

682
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:08,856
They know what happens
if they come at us again.

683
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,990
Come on.

684
01:03:27,441 --> 01:03:29,443
Bitch, are you deaf and dumb?

685
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:31,945
- Hehp ooh. Hehp ooh.

686
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:33,247
Hehp ooh.

687
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,316
- I don't speak fuckin' Meanie.

688
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:37,184
- Hehp ooh.
- Hehp ooh?

689
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:54,435
You've gotta be kidding.

690
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:56,604
All this time...

691
01:03:57,505 --> 01:03:58,606
You...

692
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,275
All this time, y'all were...

693
01:04:01,308 --> 01:04:02,510
Y'all were, uh...

694
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:07,549
- Ines? Ines, Ines, Ines!

695
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:08,582
Ines!

696
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:12,152
Stay with me. Stay with me.

697
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:15,489
Look at me. Look at me.

698
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:16,624
Look at me.

699
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,054
- The more you know,
the less you now.

700
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:49,089
Or is it the other way around?

701
01:04:49,123 --> 01:04:50,443
The less you know,
more- - Am I...

702
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:52,926
I mean, like...

703
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,561
Are we...

704
01:04:53,595 --> 01:04:54,596
Are we dead?

705
01:04:57,532 --> 01:04:59,099
- I don't feel dead.

706
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:02,002
But I have been here
for, like, an eternity,

707
01:05:02,035 --> 01:05:04,271
which is a lot of time
to think about things.

708
01:05:05,673 --> 01:05:07,609
- What kind of things?

709
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:10,612
- Ines things. Your whole deal.

710
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:12,647
Your purpose, why
you exist, you know.

711
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,681
All the basic stuff.

712
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,485
- I've done terrible things.

713
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:22,423
Made so many mistakes.

714
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,661
I don't know what I'm doing.

715
01:05:26,694 --> 01:05:28,028
Or if I ever did.

716
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:33,668
- What you should do is
throw the friggin' plane.

717
01:05:53,353 --> 01:05:56,591
You may not see it yet,
but you're on a path.

718
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:00,628
A road you've been walking
down your whole life.

719
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,632
And it's bumpy and it's rough

720
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:07,434
and sometimes you get a
little rock in your shoe

721
01:06:07,468 --> 01:06:08,603
and then you get a blister

722
01:06:08,636 --> 01:06:11,004
and then the blister just
keeps bursting, it's the worst,

723
01:06:11,038 --> 01:06:13,641
then you wonder, "Is this
the wrong shoe for this?"

724
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:18,111
But you gotta keep
walking the path

725
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:20,748
and leading the others
down it with you.

726
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:22,750
'Cause that's what
girls like you do.

727
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:28,656
Everything we do in this life,

728
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,124
the good, the bad,

729
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,596
the help and the hurt,

730
01:06:34,629 --> 01:06:35,996
it all gets added up.

731
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:40,434
And in the end,

732
01:06:40,467 --> 01:06:42,704
I'll bet top dollar
that you'll have

733
01:06:42,737 --> 01:06:46,674
a big ol', giant, 10-story
stack of good in your hands.

734
01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:49,243
You just gotta keep on.

735
01:06:56,784 --> 01:06:57,784
- Kuan?

736
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:01,723
I...

737
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:04,692
I'm...

738
01:07:04,726 --> 01:07:06,159
- I know, girl.

739
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:08,663
Me too.

740
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,004
- Hey!

741
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:54,941
The bag.

742
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:57,044
Toss it over here.

743
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,753
You got a death wish, bitch?

744
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:15,096
Yeah.

745
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:17,064
That's what I thought.

746
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,200
Aw, fuck!

747
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:29,043
Let me go!

748
01:13:31,779 --> 01:13:34,548
Oh shit, you're one of
them! Please don't kill me!

749
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:35,582
I have money!
