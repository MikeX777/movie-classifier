00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:02,559
( music playing )

2
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,975
( man blows )

3
00:02:58,058 --> 00:02:59,933
( match striking )

4
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:29,683
Female newscaster:
Eels rioted last night in Denver,

5
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,683
demanding medicine,
travel permits,

6
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,641
and full access to the 9.

7
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:37,267
Twelve Eels were arrested and all
the graffiti was found and burned.

8
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,142
Meanwhile, here in Ohio,

9
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:42,309
a warehouse full of graffiti
was found outside of Cleveland,

10
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:45,017
including a rare discovery
of pens and paper...

11
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,766
- Yuxie, MiPhotos.
- Female automated voice: Here ya go, Montag.

12
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,725
Your fans are waiting
on the 9.

13
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:51,576
Newscaster: Two Firemen
were sent to the hospital

14
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,058
with minor injuries.

15
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:55,183
Fire Commissioner Nyari
released a statement:

16
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,225
"Our elected officials
will not allow

17
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,683
the happiness
of our great state

18
00:03:58,766 --> 00:04:00,225
to be threatened
by evil Eels.

19
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:02,392
Our Firemen
will defend our democracy."

20
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,850
Yuxie: Great choice.
You'll look good in those.

21
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,451
Newscaster: And now for
the Happiness Index,

22
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:08,850
we go to Arthur Link.

23
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,808
( loud chatter )

24
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:13,766
( Firemen shouting
encouragement )

25
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,142
- ( onlookers groan )
- You like that?

26
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,975
- All: Oh!
- ( Montag grunting )

27
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,434
Montag: Ohh!

28
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Firemen: Oh!

29
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,058
Ohh!

30
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:47,058
- There she blows.
- Fireman: Yeah, Captain, yeah!

31
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,725
Captain Beatty:
When you have a "why" to fight,

32
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:51,766
you can bear almost any "how."

33
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,309
I'll give you a "why."
You knocked my tooth out.

34
00:04:54,392 --> 00:04:56,392
You're too pretty, anyway.

35
00:04:57,725 --> 00:04:59,766
Lemme see.

36
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,434
Eh. You can keep it that way.

37
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:05,142
Everything you lose
comes around in another form.

38
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:07,641
I'll get the doc
to print me up another one.

39
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,017
Captain Beatty:
Eels are bad.

40
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,725
They're dangerous,

41
00:05:11,808 --> 00:05:13,600
and they want chaos

42
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:16,058
in your hearts
and your minds.

43
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:18,183
They want to make you unhappy.

44
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,975
Eels try to upload graffiti

45
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:21,933
to the Dark 9
before we can burn it.

46
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:25,641
What should these young
Natives do, Master Trooper?

47
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,100
Stay vivid on the 9.

48
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:29,766
If you see something,
say something.

49
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,975
Beatty: Eels say we limit
information. Lies!

50
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,392
Master Trooper Montag,

51
00:05:34,475 --> 00:05:36,641
can you read any book
you want on the 9?

52
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:38,142
Sir, any book, sir.

53
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,850
Yuxie, show us
some classics.

54
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:44,058
The Bible...

55
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:47,058
"To the Lighthouse"...

56
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:49,225
and "Moby Dick."

57
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:50,766
This is all you need to know.

58
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,225
Anything else
will make you sick, crazy.

59
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,183
And that's why we're here.

60
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:56,850
To protect you

61
00:05:56,933 --> 00:06:00,517
and to keep you safe
and happy.

62
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,309
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

63
00:06:04,392 --> 00:06:05,517
Please rise.

64
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,017
All:
Happiness is truth!

65
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,183
Freedom is choice!

66
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,183
Self is strength!

67
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:19,183
( all jeering, booing )

68
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,683
Don't worry, don't worry,

69
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:23,017
these are for
training purposes only, OK?

70
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,933
( clacking )

71
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,392
Now, have any of you guys

72
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,850
ever seen one of these
bad things for real?

73
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,517
All: No!

74
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,517
We burned almost every
physical book in the country.

75
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,017
So by the time you guys grow up,
there won't be one book left.

76
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,017
He should probably raise his
hands a little higher, right?

77
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,350
I might miss.

78
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:43,683
( scattered laughter )

79
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:45,100
( weapon clicking )

80
00:06:55,683 --> 00:06:58,309
( all cheering )

81
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:00,559
Whoo!

82
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:03,434
( siren wails )

83
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:05,237
- ( siren continues )
- This is not a drill!

84
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,683
We've got Eels on the move!

85
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,434
Man: We got Eels
slipping away!

86
00:07:08,517 --> 00:07:10,225
- Move! Move! Move!
- Montag: Let's ride!

87
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:12,891
Check all gear!
Let's go, let's go!

88
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,766
Let's go!
This is why we train!

89
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,933
Let's burn, let's burn,
let's burn!

90
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:23,309
( fire truck horn blowing )

91
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:28,725

- Salamander!

Fireman 2:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,350
Kyle! Jove! Around back!

106
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,058
Have us a good,
old-fashioned barbecue!

107
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:08,850
Captain wants since Eel soup!
Let's do it, boys!

108
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:11,434
- Pipemen.
- What do I upload? Wiki pages?

109
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:14,034
- Shakespeare? Coltrane?
- I gotta get to the servers. Save what you can.

110
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:15,493
Guys, it's game time.
Y'all know what to do.

111
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:16,808
Freeze! Don't move!

112
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:19,725
( indistinct yelling )

113
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:24,142
- Montag, upstairs!
- I got him!

114
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:27,017
- Don't make me chase after you!
- Hold him down!

115
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,475
Everybody stay
right where you are!

116
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:32,225
- ( Montag grunts )
- ( woman squeals )

117
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,683
Hey, drop the cord!

118
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,434
( man grunts, groans )

119
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,225
- ( switchblade clicks )
- Montag: Come on. Yeah.

120
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,850
- Aah! Aaah!
- Hey.

121
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,517
Come on.

122
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
( both grunting )

123
00:08:49,392 --> 00:08:51,225
You dream about
hiding from me!

124
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:53,142
You better wake up
and apologize.

125
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,975
Hey, Captain,
wanna come get some?

126
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:56,933
Go check the other rooms.

127
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:01,891
Are you done?

128
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,975
( faint clicking )

129
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,309
( computers humming )

130
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,017
Beatty:
What are you waitin' for?

131
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,766
Waitin' on you.

132
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,891
Raven:
Good evening, Cleveland,

133
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,475
and welcome
to tonight's fire show.

134
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,100
Captain Beatty
and his Master Trooper Montag

135
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:41,891
have uncovered Eels
pretending to be Natives.

136
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:44,225
What punishment would you like
to see here tonight?

137
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:45,766
Welcome, Natives,

138
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,641
and everybody at home
watchin' on the 9.

139
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:50,808
Look what we found hiding
in your beautiful neighborhood.

140
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,933
- ( booing, jeering )
- ( woman shouting )

141
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:55,183
Eels don't deserve freedom,
now, do they?

142
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:57,891
- All: No!
- We won't let 'em take our jobs

143
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,891
and steal our tax money,
now, will we?

144
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,850
Woman:
Hell, no! Self is strength!

145
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,766
Happiness is truth!

146
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,641
Guess what time it is?

147
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:08,517
All: Time to burn
for America again!

148
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,225
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no.

149
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:13,725
No, no. Wait.

150
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:16,183
Stone! Reprint.

151
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,434
Yuxie, +10 years.

152
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,975
Yuxie:
Identity deletion commencing.

153
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:23,683

- ( man screaming )

154
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:26,725
( man groaning )

155
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:29,975
Man: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Delete his identity!

156
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,933
- ( beeping )
- ( whirring )

157
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:35,517
- Man 1: Ban his travel.
- Man 2: Get that money, too.

158
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:42,392
Enjoy your new life
as an Eel.

159
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:48,766
I'm not fire...
I'm fire +100.

160
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,891
I'm molten lava on graffiti.

161
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:53,600
They call me a walking
incinerator for happiness.

162
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:55,434
Damn, it's a pleasure to burn!

163
00:10:55,517 --> 00:10:58,267
Everybody watching at home
on the 9, are you ready?

164
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,100
Man:
Burn 'em, Montag!

165
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:02,350
( people shouting )

166
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,559
Man: Take that, Eels!
Take that!

167
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,725
( crowd chattering, cheering )

168
00:12:02,434 --> 00:12:04,475
- ( hums, beeps )
- ( lock clicks )

169
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:12,766
( beeps )

170
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:17,808
Beatty: Hey.

171
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:19,559
You're still high
on kerosene, aren't you?

172
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,600
I can smell it from here.
Let's get goin'.

173
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:29,434
- Montag: Where we headed?
- Beatty: A little after-hours trip.

174
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,017
You hear from Major Curtis?

175
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,225
( chuckles )

176
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:34,225
It's happening.
End of the year.

177
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,309
- Oh! I knew it.
- ( Beatty chuckles )

178
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,891
- "Major Beatty."
- Yeah.

179
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,725
I'm gonna miss your
ugly mug around here.

180
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:41,933
Yeah. You'll finally
become me.

181
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,559
No, no, no.
Not become you.

182
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:46,933
I'm gonna be Captain
motherfuckin' Montag.

183
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,600
( music playing )

184
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,766
Beatty:
There she is.

185
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,659
Montag: Don't worry,
I'll talk to her this time.

186
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:20,975
Keep your dick in your pants
and stand guard.

187
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:23,808
Well, well, well.
Clarisse.

188
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:26,142
I hope you're not
wasting my time tonight.

189
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:29,350
Your last tip led me to
Boy Scouts with pornos.

190
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,641
Clarisse: Reactivate my fingers
like you said you would.

191
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:34,683
Beatty: Feed me scraps,
and I'll delete your travel permit.

192
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,517
That's bullshit.
You need me.

193
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,100
How many years
did we restrict you? Six?

194
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:45,808
After all the tips
I gave you, I should be free.

195
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,183
A beautiful, free rat.

196
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:53,058
Take a year
off my sentence,

197
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:54,850
and I'll give you
something you like.

198
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:57,600
Six months.
But it better be good.

199
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:07,983
I didn't hear the captain
say you could leave.

200
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:10,975
( scoffs ) Yeah? How come he
always makes you wait outside

201
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,058
like a little dog, huh?

202
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,017
You're just like Beatty.

203
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,392
I'm not like Beatty.

204
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,850
- Everyone has a master.
- Not me.

205
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,267
You spy on me,
but you never do anything.

206
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:31,100
- Why do I always make you nervous?
- You don't.

207
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:33,975
When I see you burning up Eel's lives,
you don't look nervous.

208
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:36,891
That's because
I'm very good at my job.

209
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,475
Hmm.

210
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,350
Have you ever thought,
even for one second,

211
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:43,309
why you do what you do?

212
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:47,891
You should try reading
before burning.

213
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:49,559
See you around, Montag.

214
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,434
Hey.

215
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:56,100
Off limits.

216
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:59,225
Let's go.
She recommended a spot.

217
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,683
Man: Captain Beatty,
I... I have my permits, sir,

218
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:06,392
- all one hundred.
- I can't wait to see 'em.

219
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:12,017
See if you can find me
a new pair of shoes.

220
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,933
( hollow sound )

221
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:16,766
Captain.

222
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:23,309
Well, look what I found.

223
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,559
You guys must think
you're pretty slick.

224
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,600
Beatty: Sit down.
Don't move.

225
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:32,267
Have they uploaded
to the 9?

226
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:35,725
Nah. Just this monitor.

227
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,392
Hit "play." Do it.

228
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:41,933
Let's see what
they have to say.

229
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:45,517
Before bots and the rise
of automated writing,

230
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,058
we had jobs for journalists...

231
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,183
( static )... someday.

232
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,559
She'd spend weeks,
sometimes months,

233
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:54,392
investigating a story,

234
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,725
and then she'd publish
a series of articl...

235
00:15:56,808 --> 00:16:00,225
( static )... dreds,
even thousands of words long

236
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,683
on physical paper

237
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:05,225
and the Internet,
or the 9, today,

238
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,517
which everyone
was free to read.

239
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,017
But nobody was reading anymore,

240
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,350
or they were just glancing
at the headlines

241
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:13,891
generated by an algorithm...

242
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,183
Beatty:
Thousands of words? Ugh.

243
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,392
In your pathetic time,
were people happy?

244
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,808
No. There were so many
millions of opinions

245
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,309
that our country slid
into the Second Civil War.

246
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:26,434
Eight million dead,
including my father.

247
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,100
Your father
must have been old enough

248
00:16:28,183 --> 00:16:31,975
to remember a time
when firemen put fires out

249
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,600
instead of starting them.

250
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:37,309
- Hey!
- Just relax, all right?

251
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,100
Beatty:
Benjamin Franklin,

252
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,850
the founder of our
first fire department,

253
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,392
gave us the right to burn.

254
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,392
Those are lies.

255
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:47,559
Ben Franklin
did not do that.

256
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:50,641
After the last
of your generation dies,

257
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:53,641
so will your words...

258
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,600
your memories...

259
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:59,017
and the burden
of your fake past.

260
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,701
Female newscaster:
Even in their self-hours,

261
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:02,975
Captain Beatty
and Master Trooper Montag

262
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:04,142
keep Cleveland safe.

263
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,392
Let's give them a +100 salute.

264
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:09,808
Do your part. See something,
say something. Tell Yuxie.

265
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,309
Meanwhile, Firemen
outside of Buffalo, New York,

266
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:14,850
captured Eels attempting to
cross the border into Canada.

267
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,309
There has been an increase in illegal
migration, and local fire stations...

268
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:20,891
Beatty: When you become a captain,
you have to know more.

269
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:23,683
You'll get to read more.

270
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:26,058
So you've read
entire books.

271
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:27,683
( grunts )

272
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,350
Yeah, but the Ministry,
of course,

273
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:30,933
they have complete works,
right?

274
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,017
I don't know.

275
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,933
I suppose when they make me
District Major

276
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:37,850
they'll throw me
a few more scraps,

277
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,058
but the Ministry's...

278
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,808
How can we see anything but the
fire shadows in the cave...

279
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:51,267
if we're never allowed
to move our heads?

280
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,766
What does that mean?

281
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,142
Nothin'

282
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:00,808
You're as impatient as I was
when I was your age.

283
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:05,392
Yeah. I just wonder
how much my dad knew.

284
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,850
- He was a great Fireman.
- Damn right he was.

285
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:10,725
- And a friend.
- Fuckin' Eels.

286
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:12,475
He was a hero.

287
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:17,850
Same as you'll be,
Guy Montag!

288
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,100
I am a hero.

289
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,017
Hmm.

290
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,766
I am a hero.

Keep this sponge alive!

298
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,766

Clarisse:
It's a DD series.

301
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,891
It works. I put in
a new belt myself.

302
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:24,350
( jazz music playing )

303
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:25,808
What do you have for me?

304
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:28,766
There is an abandoned house
out in the woods near Bedford.

305
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,850
It's a drop-off spot
for graffiti.

306
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:33,725
- Does anyone live there?
- No, I don't think so.

307
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,766
Montag:
Yuxie, Firemen.

308
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,309
Did we used to put out fires?

309
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,475
Yuxie:
That's a classic Eel lie.

310
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,142
And Benjamin Franklin.

311
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:03,267
Founder of
our first fire department.

312
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,683
What's wrong, Montag?

313
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:11,933
Nothin'.

314
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:14,225
Your vitals have been off
recently.

315
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,225
I'm going to reconfigure
your cocktail

316
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:18,475
and have new drops delivered.

317
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,392
That's fine.

318
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,766
Yuxie: John, have you used
your drops today?

319
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,392
Yuxie, go dark.

320
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,142
I'm secure now.

321
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,891
( beeps twice )

322
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,017
- ( man talking, indistinct )
- ( baby crying )

323
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:11,725
Woman:
Clarisse?

324
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,641
Haven't had milk all week.
Thanks.

325
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:16,475
Sorry, I couldn't find
any cooking oil.

326
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,891
- That's OK.
- Hey, Clarisse?

327
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:19,766
Be careful
what you're selling.

328
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,434
People are talking.

329
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:30,559

playing )

330
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,683
( melting solder hissing )

331
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:06,017
Yuxie, go dark.

332
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,850
I'm secure now, Montag.

333
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,891
( device beeping )

334
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:28,808
Yuxie: Signal lost.
Entering a black hole.

335
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:31,933
Set a transponder
so Raven can find us.

336
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,683
- ( beep )
- Montag: Transponder set.

337
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:40,225
Did Clarisse tell
you about this spot?

338
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:47,975
( crickets chirping )

339
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:54,891

Douglas.

342
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,808
Freeman, check around back.

343
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,017
( floorboards creak )

344
00:26:27,434 --> 00:26:29,475
Stone!

345
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,183
- Jove, Kyle, clear this room!
- Yes, sir.

346
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:48,434
( clicks )

347
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:50,766
Beatty: Montag, get that tumor Eel
on her feet.

348
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,517
The rest of you
search the house.

349
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,142
- Now.
- Fireman: Yes, sir.

350
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,475
How many of you are there?

351
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:00,559
( snap )

352
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:02,142
How many?

353
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,350
"Grapes of Wrath."

354
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:10,975
Hmm. Get her up.

355
00:27:11,058 --> 00:27:14,392
You heard the captain.
Up. On your feet.

356
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:16,434
Beatty: How many more of these
do you have,

357
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,309
Ma Joad?

358
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,683
If you can read,
you can talk.

359
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:28,267
Play the man, Master Ridley.

360
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,933
We shall this day light such
a candle, by God's grace,

361
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,309
as I trust
shall never be put out.

362
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:35,933
Fireman:
Captain Beatty!

363
00:27:36,017 --> 00:27:38,434
You're never gonna believe
what we found, sir.

364
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,225
You gotta get up here.

365
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,017
Phelps, keep eyes on her.

366
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:23,683
This is gonna be the most important
burn the country has ever seen, sir.

367
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:25,808
Beatty: Go see if Raven
followed the transponder.

368
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:28,142
- But sir...
- You just heard the captain.

369
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:29,600
Now move.

370
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:38,309
A regular damn
Tower Of Babel.

371
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,517
I've only seen something
like this once in my career,

372
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,766
when I was a cadet.

373
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,267
Have you ever seen
a physical book before?

374
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,434
Hmm.

375
00:28:58,434 --> 00:29:02,641
Kafka. A pornographer
and a sexual pervert.

376
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,475
I like that about him.

377
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,683
Have you read that book?

378
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:09,808
Every Fireman sooner or
later wants to know...

379
00:29:09,891 --> 00:29:11,559
what the Eels know,

380
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:15,267
what's in all this graffiti
that we burn.

381
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,434
You want to hold it?

382
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:23,434
Go on.

383
00:29:23,517 --> 00:29:26,142
Before the men come back.

384
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:35,142
( whispers )
Open it.

385
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:43,850
Read.

386
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,100
Read.

387
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:49,808
Read.

388
00:29:56,766 --> 00:30:01,683
Do you want to know
what's inside all these books?

389
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,100
Insanity.

390
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:09,100
The Eels
want to measure their place

391
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:11,434
in the universe,

392
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:14,850
so they turn to these novels

393
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:18,058
about non-existent people.

394
00:30:18,142 --> 00:30:21,350
Or worse, philosophers.
Look, here's Spinoza.

395
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:24,517
One expert screaming down
another expert's throat.

396
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,475
"We have free will."
"No, all of our actions are predetermined."

397
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,225
Each one says the opposite,

398
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,725
and a man comes away lost,

399
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:39,183
feeling more... bestial
and lonely than before.

400
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:42,142
Now, if you don't
want a person unhappy,

401
00:30:42,225 --> 00:30:45,891
you don't give them two sides
of a question to worry about.

402
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:48,350
- Just give 'em one.
- Better yet, none.

403
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,309
Ah. See?

404
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:54,808
"Huck Finn"...

405
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:56,975
and his "nigger" friend.

406
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:01,017
The whites knew that you blacks
were offended, so what did we do?

407
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
We burned it.

408
00:31:05,183 --> 00:31:07,641
Oh. ( chuckles )

409
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:09,641
And then "Native Son"
came along,

410
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:12,766
and the whites didn't appreciate
that one all that much,

411
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,725
so they burned it, too.

412
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:16,600
Why didn't they like it?

413
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,434
Henry Miller,
Hemingway.

414
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:25,683
The feminists don't approve,

415
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:28,850
so into the flames they go.

416
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:32,475
You see, we are not
born equal, Guy,

417
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,350
so we must be made equal
by the fire,

418
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:39,392
and then... we can be happy.

419
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:43,600
So, we burn.

420
00:31:46,183 --> 00:31:49,142
Well, let's clear all this
filth out of here and...

421
00:31:49,225 --> 00:31:51,058
get the fire show
started with.

422
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,434
Shall we?

423
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:56,683
But take one last look.

424
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:59,350
You may never see
anything like this again.

425
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:05,309
Your grandchildren won't even
understand what a book is.

426
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,683
Woman: Can you tell us
anything about what's inside?

427
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:46,183
Nothing that can't burn
at 451 degrees.

428
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,100
Newscaster:
And there you have it...

429
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:50,017
( books thudding )

430
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:29,058
Beatty: Montag.

431
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:31,267
Let's get her
out of here.

432
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,017
Come on.

433
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,559
Let's go.

434
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:42,975
Lady, this whole house
is gonna get torched.

435
00:33:43,058 --> 00:33:45,058
And me, with my books.

436
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:46,142
Let's go.

437
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:47,183
Montag, never mind.

438
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,975
Just get over here, please.

439
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:51,183
Captain, we're just
gonna leave her?

440
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,517
Get over here now.

441
00:33:56,725 --> 00:33:58,725
Look, miss,
you can do what you like,

442
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:02,350
but you know as well as I do
these books are gonna burn.

443
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,434
No.

444
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,933
Omnis.

445
00:36:14,058 --> 00:36:15,641
Omnis.

446
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:18,559
The Ministry has wiped out
the word "omnis"

447
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:20,309
from across the 9.

448
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,766
This coward is not
going to become a martyr

449
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,350
before we find out what the
hell she's shouting about.

450
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,975
Captain Beatty,
perhaps you can explain

451
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:31,142
why you let this Eel
start a bonfire?

452
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:34,641
We didn't know she had a match, sir,
and the kerosene...

453
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,183
Major Curtis
spoke highly of you.

454
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:38,559
I hope I can come
to understand why.

455
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:42,475
After "Beatty's Barbecue,"
our team reported the word "omnis"

456
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,559
appearing in unusually
high numbers on the Dark 9.

457
00:36:45,641 --> 00:36:48,434
If an Eel is going
to blow herself up for it,

458
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,600
we need to get ahead of it.

459
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:55,058
Raven: ...the first self-fire
in Ohio's history,

460
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:56,683
and only the fourth
in the nation.

461
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:59,017
This marks a new low
in Eel actions

462
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,475
threatening our happiness.

463
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,975
Details about this tumor Eel
are coming in.

464
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:04,683
She lived alone in the woods,

465
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,725
without Yuxie,
like a wild animal,

466
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,017
and suffered from a +100
mental illness,

467
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,100
a result of extreme exposure
to reading graffiti.

468
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:14,850
Coward!

469
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:17,975
Raven: We will be updating you
as more details come in.

470
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:22,100
Whoa.

471
00:37:22,183 --> 00:37:23,517
You all right?

472
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,850
Always.

473
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,725
Life of a Master Trooper, huh?

474
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:35,475
Beatty: Montag.

475
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:42,100
You hesitated tonight
in front of the men.

476
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,309
I know.

477
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:47,309
But it won't happen
again.

478
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:51,142
You know, it's my first time
seeing a self-burn, too.

479
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:54,808
But as far as I'm concerned,

480
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:57,225
it's just proves
we're doing the right thing.

481
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:00,517
What was that old lady
talkin' about?

482
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,434
"Master Ridley, play th..."
Somethin'.

483
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,100
Well, back when
people still believed in gods,

484
00:38:08,183 --> 00:38:11,891
the Brits burned alive
two Eels at the stake,

485
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:13,517
Ridley and Latimer,

486
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,975
for praying to a different book
than their queen did.

487
00:38:17,058 --> 00:38:20,309
Before us, people committed
genocides over books,

488
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:23,267
while others blew themselves up
killing innocent people.

489
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,600
Insanity +100.

490
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:28,100
But why did she burn herself
for books?

491
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:31,434
Well, she tried to burn us all,
don't you think?

492
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,559
She didn't say "coward."

493
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:37,933
She said "omnis."
What is that?

494
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:40,725
Well, the commissioner won't say
what the Ministry knows,

495
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:44,225
but I guess we're gonna
have to find out.

496
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,392
Burn me.

497
00:38:54,475 --> 00:38:56,058
- John.
- Go ahead.

498
00:38:57,725 --> 00:39:01,309
Hurry up.
I won't ask twice.

499
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:02,392
( lighter clicks )

500
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:10,808
I know you're different
than the other men.

501
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,725
I watched you grow up,

502
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:17,350
and that's how I know
you feel the same inside as me.

503
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:20,766
Closer.

504
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:26,309
I've been burned so many times

505
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:30,267
I don't know where my scars
end and my body begins.

506
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,559
( sizzling )

507
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,933
( grunts )

508
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:44,975
There's no way
you're gonna break.

509
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:50,225
You're the youngest cadet I ever
accepted into the Youth Fire Brigade.

510
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:53,975
I raised you.

511
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:58,641
And one day
you'll be just like me, son.

512
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:02,058
You won't feel anything
when they burn you.

513
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:04,933
( closes lighter )

514
00:40:15,183 --> 00:40:16,600
Yuxie, go dark, please.

515
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:19,350
Yuxie:
I'm secure now, Montag.

516
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,142
"I am a sick man.

517
00:40:42,142 --> 00:40:44,475
I am a wicked man.

518
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:49,017
An unattractive man.

519
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,600
I think my liver hurts."

520
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:05,559
"I agree that
'two times two is four'

521
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:08,559
is an excellent thing.

522
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:12,725
But 'two times two is five'

523
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:17,933
is something also
a most charming little thing."

524
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,517
- Yuxie: False.
- Yuxie, I said go dark.

525
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,267
We are dark.
It's just me and you.

526
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,058
But that is false.
Two times two can only be four.

527
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,683
What are you doing, Montag?

528
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,350
Are you feeling OK?

529
00:41:39,683 --> 00:41:41,766
Where are you going?

530
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:00,267
( sensor chimes )

531
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:31,725
Man: I don't think that old woman
killed herself.

532
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:33,725
I think they staged it.

533
00:43:33,808 --> 00:43:35,392
It's all fake.

534
00:43:35,475 --> 00:43:37,118
Didn't even bother
to sync her lips this time.

535
00:43:37,142 --> 00:43:38,142
You saw that shit, right?

536
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,142
Yeah, they definitely
murdered her.

537
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:42,017
Why do you keep
pounding away at it?

538
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:45,766
Hey. Are you good?

539
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,766
Clarisse, you know
what we're working on.

540
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,559
We need someone
with your connections.

541
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:53,350
So you tell me when you're
ready to come back to us.

542
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,475
- See you later.
- Be safe.

543
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,975
( dogs barking
in distance )

544
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:39,225
- What are you? What do you want?
- Hey!

545
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,975
Did Beatty send you?

546
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:43,392
- No, I just came to talk.
- What do you want?

547
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,309
I want to know
who that old woman was.

548
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:49,808
I don't know.

549
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:54,225
She lit herself on fire...
for books.

550
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:56,600
- Why?
- What do you care?

551
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:59,309
Because I can still
smell her burning.

552
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:03,183
- You did that.
- And you told us exactly where to find her.

553
00:45:05,517 --> 00:45:09,142
She didn't say "coward."
She said "omnis."

554
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:10,641
What is that?

555
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:14,100
I don't know.

556
00:45:16,434 --> 00:45:18,808
I just want to
show you something.

557
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:32,183
I took it from her house.

558
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:34,142
Is this a trap, pipeman?

559
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:37,683
If anybody
sees me with this...

560
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:39,267
I'm dead.

561
00:45:58,392 --> 00:45:59,766
( keys jingling )

562
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,100
( lock clicks )

563
00:46:04,225 --> 00:46:05,267
Hey, Clarisse.

564
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:09,183
Yeah?

565
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,267
( voice in hallway,
indistinct )

566
00:46:25,975 --> 00:46:27,267
She didn't see
who you were.

567
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:28,559
I shouldn't be here.

568
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:29,808
Then leave.

569
00:46:32,975 --> 00:46:34,309
( locks click )

570
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,850
Please don't do that.

571
00:47:18,766 --> 00:47:20,641
( inhales deeply )

572
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:23,225
Can you read that
out loud?

573
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:25,017
Please?

574
00:47:30,434 --> 00:47:33,559
"Even if man were nothing
but a piano key,

575
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:38,183
even if this were proved to him by
natural science and mathematics,

576
00:47:38,267 --> 00:47:41,725
even then, he will invent
destruction and chaos.

577
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:45,058
He will invent all kinds of
suffering out of ingratitude

578
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:47,766
simply to convince himself
that he is a man

579
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,766
and not a piano key.

580
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:54,559
Hard to understand, right?

581
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,975
The Ministry has been wiping away
language in order to wipe away thought.

582
00:48:01,058 --> 00:48:03,600
There used to be 6,000 languages
in the world.

583
00:48:03,683 --> 00:48:06,475
Today there are fewer than 60.

584
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,600
Why do you think the Ministry wants to
create one universal language on the 9?

585
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,641
For the connection
and happiness of...

586
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,808
all Natives.

587
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:20,350
During the Second Civil War,
the old tech companies,

588
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:22,891
they built systems
to predict our thoughts.

589
00:48:22,975 --> 00:48:26,434
Then they became the Ministry,
or the Ministry joined them.

590
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:29,392
And they sold us
what we wanted,

591
00:48:29,475 --> 00:48:31,475
self and happiness,

592
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:33,392
which the 9 provides in spades

593
00:48:33,475 --> 00:48:36,933
and what we hired you
to defend... with fire.

594
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:39,392
You're telling me
people wanted it this way.

595
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:41,392
The Ministry
didn't do this to us.

596
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:43,517
We did it to ourselves.

597
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,683
We demanded a world like this.

598
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,850
Let me ask you somethin'.

599
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:01,891
Benjamin Franklin...

600
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:03,933
did he start
the first fire department?

601
00:49:04,017 --> 00:49:05,933
Yeah, but to put fires out,

602
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:08,017
not to start them.

603
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,933
- Beatty told me the opposite.
- I know exactly what Beatty told you.

604
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:14,475
Maybe he believes that;
maybe he's lying to you.

605
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,850
Maybe when Beatty was young,
he let his fire captain lie to him.

606
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:22,766
Do you have trouble with
memory? Take a lot of drops?

607
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:27,517
What about you?
Can you remember your past?

608
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,725
Some.

609
00:49:28,808 --> 00:49:31,850
Are you hungry?
I don't have much.

610
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,434
How 'bout your parents?

611
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:38,891
Can you remember them?

612
00:49:41,017 --> 00:49:45,808
I was raised by Eels to be an Eel,
pretending to be a Native.

613
00:49:45,891 --> 00:49:49,058
We read books, watched films...

614
00:49:49,142 --> 00:49:50,933
everything you burn.

615
00:49:51,017 --> 00:49:55,183
By the time I was a teen,
I wanted to be normal, like you.

616
00:49:55,267 --> 00:49:57,766
So I ran away from home,

617
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:03,142
got hooked on the 9,
the drops... everything.

618
00:50:03,225 --> 00:50:05,808
I was happy for a while.

619
00:50:05,891 --> 00:50:08,808
Then, you know, life.

620
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:10,766
Men.

621
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:14,725
I was broke,
so I started selling graffiti.

622
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,600
Didn't know that old woman
would be there.

623
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:28,434
I had never thought about the people
behind the things that I burn.

624
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:34,891
I mean, they must have spent
their entire life making things.

625
00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:37,434
And here I come,

626
00:50:37,517 --> 00:50:40,434
in two seconds...
it's gone.

627
00:50:50,392 --> 00:50:52,600
I want to show you something.

628
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,475
( playing harmonica )

629
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,600
( continues playing )

630
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:34,600
Try.

631
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:37,808
Come on.

632
00:51:54,225 --> 00:51:55,808
Like this?

633
00:51:58,309 --> 00:52:02,017
- ( blows loud note )
- ( both chuckle )

634
00:52:03,975 --> 00:52:06,475
- ( plays softly )
- Here.

635
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,434
Put this one here on top.

636
00:52:10,517 --> 00:52:14,475
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
Try it.

637
00:52:16,975 --> 00:52:20,517
( plays note with
slight vibrato )

638
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,183
( continues playing )

639
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,475
All the details surrounding
the Omnis are classified,

640
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,993
but the Ministry will include the
public to help smoke it out.

641
00:53:13,017 --> 00:53:15,058
The danger is real
and immediate.

642
00:53:15,142 --> 00:53:17,766
Washington's watching us, boys.

643
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,517
I want your cities
to burn so hot

644
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,725
the commander in chief
can roast marshmallows

645
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:24,142
all the way
from the White House.

646
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:27,100
Make it rain kerosene.

647
00:53:52,434 --> 00:53:54,475
( rain pattering )

648
00:54:20,475 --> 00:54:23,475
Beatty: DNA.

649
00:54:23,559 --> 00:54:24,850
The genetic information

650
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:27,267
found inside
all living organisms.

651
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:31,641
The Eels have converted
the language of technology

652
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:33,891
into the the language of DNA.

653
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:36,850
They've figured out a way
to insert enough graffiti

654
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:40,100
into this microscopic
speck of DNA

655
00:54:40,183 --> 00:54:43,017
to bury the earth
ten times over.

656
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,392
The Omnis is the collective
consciousness of mankind.

657
00:54:47,475 --> 00:54:51,725
It will be every book,
painting, music, film,

658
00:54:51,808 --> 00:54:53,225
all of history,

659
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:55,600
everything on the savages'
internet of old...

660
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:59,017
news, memoirs, facts...

661
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,475
it will be a trillion
person-years of graffiti...

662
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,808
all inside this microscopic
strand of DNA.

663
00:55:08,891 --> 00:55:11,600
Now, the Ministry
believes it is here in Ohio,

664
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,225
and in transit
to scientists in Canada.

665
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:17,017
We have to find it
before it crosses the border.

666
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,725
Captain, if they succeed...

667
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:21,517
how will we stop it?

668
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:27,183
If the Omnis is unleashed,
there will be no way to stop it.

669
00:55:28,641 --> 00:55:31,975
All of humanity's chaotic
knowledge will burst forth

670
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:36,058
like mosquitoes
spreading malaria...

671
00:55:36,142 --> 00:55:39,600
and the dark countries
will take over.

672
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:45,142
Even the greatest army
of Firemen

673
00:55:45,225 --> 00:55:49,725
will seem like spitting babies
before the Omnis.

674
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:52,891
And everything our parents,
our grandparents,

675
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:57,309
sacrificed in the Second
Civil War will be lost.

676
00:55:57,392 --> 00:56:01,100
We will not let that happen.

677
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,600
We will burn down the city tonight,
gentlemen!

678
00:56:06,683 --> 00:56:08,350
- Salamander!
- All: Ho!

679
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:10,725
- Salamander!
- Ho!

680
00:56:18,683 --> 00:56:21,933
Montag: Eels on the move!
Eels on the move!

681
00:56:22,017 --> 00:56:23,434
This is why we burn!

682
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,725
Beatty: If any of you know
where the Omnis is

683
00:56:36,808 --> 00:56:39,475
and don't talk,
your lives will be burned!

684
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:41,100
( dogs barking, snarling )

685
00:56:41,183 --> 00:56:42,808
Raven:
Breaking news.

686
00:56:42,891 --> 00:56:45,641
There is a new threat
to our nation's happiness...

687
00:56:45,725 --> 00:56:47,017
the Omnis.

688
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,641
The Ministry
has not revealed details,

689
00:56:48,725 --> 00:56:50,600
but fire divisions
across Pennsylvania,

690
00:56:50,683 --> 00:56:51,559
Indiana, and Ohio,

691
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,683
are conducting raids,

692
00:56:52,766 --> 00:56:54,641
searching for this new evil.

693
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,517
Fireman:
Get him! Get him!

694
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,225
Omnis! What's that mean to you?
Huh? What's that mean to you?!

695
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:01,149
Beatty: You're not
doing yourselves any favors.

696
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:03,017
Tell me where the Omnis is!

697
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,725
Eel: Death to fire!
Real liberty unite!

698
00:57:05,808 --> 00:57:07,475
- Come here!
- ( man groans )

699
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:10,017
Fireman: Slippery little Eel.
In the truck!

700
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,100
Beatty: They try to say there's
no evidence danger exists.

701
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:16,766
Well, then show me the evidence
danger doesn't exist.

702
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,183
The truth is,
this danger is real,

703
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:20,434
the threat is real.

704
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:22,058
Omnis is real.

705
00:57:22,142 --> 00:57:24,017
Eel:
Death to fire!

706
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,350
( device whirring )

707
00:57:30,434 --> 00:57:31,891
Clarisse:
"To be sure, I myself

708
00:57:31,975 --> 00:57:34,392
just made up
all these words of yours;

709
00:57:34,475 --> 00:57:36,600
this, too,
is from underground.

710
00:57:36,683 --> 00:57:38,975
I've spent forty years
on end there

711
00:57:39,058 --> 00:57:41,641
listening to these words
of yours through a crack.

712
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:43,142
I thought them up myself

713
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:45,850
since this was all
that would get thought up."

714
00:57:48,683 --> 00:57:50,017
Beatty:
I will have you

715
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,475
down on this street
before the night is over!

716
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,309
Consequences of silence
will be severe!

717
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:57,350
Help yourselves
and your neighbors

718
00:57:57,434 --> 00:57:59,267
by telling us what you know!

719
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,683
Not tomorrow,
not the next day, but now!

720
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:09,183
Montag: "At least I myself
have only recently resolved

721
00:58:09,267 --> 00:58:11,600
to recall some
of my former adventures,

722
00:58:11,683 --> 00:58:14,725
which, till now,
I have always avoided.

723
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:17,434
Can it be that
you are indeed so gullible

724
00:58:17,517 --> 00:58:19,766
to imagine I will
publish this all?

725
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:21,850
And, what's more,
give it to you to read?"

726
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,517
- ( man groaning )
- ( bottle shatters )

727
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,017
( panting )

728
00:58:43,517 --> 00:58:47,225
Montag: "Now I want precisely
to make a test.

729
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:49,142
Is it possible to... to per...

730
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:52,641
Is it possible to be perfectly
candid with oneself

731
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:57,392
and not be afraid...
of the whole truth?"

732
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:03,808
( rain pattering )

733
00:59:31,142 --> 00:59:34,392
Beatty: One of you Eels must know
something about the Omnis.

734
00:59:42,183 --> 00:59:45,766
( whispering ) What if I tell
these people what you do?

735
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,891
What would be worse...

736
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:57,475
what I do to you,
or what they do to you?

737
00:59:59,225 --> 01:00:01,600
Man: We're all
the same here.

738
01:00:01,683 --> 01:00:04,267
Whatever you do to her,
you do to us.

739
01:00:05,766 --> 01:00:07,225
Is that so?

740
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:09,392
Fair enough.

741
01:00:09,475 --> 01:00:10,808
( clatter )

742
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:12,725
- Ohh!
- ( body hits ground )

743
01:00:12,808 --> 01:00:16,350
I am your judge,
and I am your court.

744
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:19,100
I receive you
when you come,

745
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,017
- and I...
- Ohh!

746
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,267
dismiss you when you go!

747
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,392
- Beatty: Round 'em up!
- Fireman: Get over here.

748
01:00:29,475 --> 01:00:32,267
Round 'em up. Over there!

749
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:35,225
- Round 'em up.
- ( all shouting )

750
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:39,183
Come on. Come here.

751
01:00:41,517 --> 01:00:43,975
( Firemen shouting at Eels )

752
01:00:48,434 --> 01:00:50,559
Newscaster: The Ministry
has placed the nation

753
01:00:50,641 --> 01:00:54,350
in a +100 state of security
until the Omnis is found.

754
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:56,850
Youth Cadets have been
recruited to patrol borders

755
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:58,517
and search all transit hubs.

756
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,559
Do your duty.
Stay vivid on the 9

757
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:03,891
and report
all suspicious activity.

758
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:07,350
- Montag: What are you doing?
- I have to get out of here.

759
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:09,392
Where you gonna go?

760
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:11,309
There are people hiding out
at a compound

761
01:01:11,392 --> 01:01:12,683
my family used to know.

762
01:01:12,766 --> 01:01:14,225
Maybe I can help them.

763
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:16,183
They got checkpoints
all over the place.

764
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:17,933
You think you can make it?

765
01:01:18,017 --> 01:01:20,641
I have a friend
who knows where they are.

766
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:23,058
I think he can help me.

767
01:01:25,225 --> 01:01:27,891
Will I see you again?

768
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:56,309
Fireman: Keep searching
for that Omnis!

769
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:01,933
- Montag: Get 'em out of here!
- Fireman: Yes, sir.

770
01:02:15,142 --> 01:02:17,267
All clear.
Let's check upstairs.

771
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,600
- ( clatter )
- Man: Shh!

772
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,517
( opens door,
pulls back curtain )

773
01:02:58,434 --> 01:03:00,517
( rain pattering )

774
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:24,392
Beatty: And how would you explain
your behavior today?

775
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:26,309
I fucked up.

776
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,434
- I couldn't tell you why.
- Was it the kid?

777
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:35,017
Eels use kids as decoys
all the time.

778
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,142
No excuse. I know my actions
put you and the men in danger.

779
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:41,350
What if they had
had the Omnis?

780
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:50,725
Captain Beatty...

781
01:03:50,808 --> 01:03:53,517
sir, it's been a true honor.

782
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,392
But...

783
01:03:55,475 --> 01:03:58,766
I respectfully ask
that you accept my resignation.

784
01:04:03,725 --> 01:04:05,267
Get that off my desk.

785
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:06,350
I'm sorry, John.

786
01:04:06,434 --> 01:04:07,559
Do it. Now.

787
01:04:15,725 --> 01:04:17,891
Are you serious?

788
01:04:17,975 --> 01:04:22,309
I just submitted your name
to replace me as captain.

789
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,142
- It's not about that.
- Oh.

790
01:04:24,225 --> 01:04:26,392
So you're willing
to throw away

791
01:04:26,475 --> 01:04:29,183
the sixteen years
that I've invested in you.

792
01:04:29,267 --> 01:04:32,183
I have sixteen years

793
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:35,475
of the Ministry's shit
in my head.

794
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:37,350
And I want to know
why we burn.

795
01:04:37,434 --> 01:04:39,891
- I want to decide.
- Ah.

796
01:04:39,975 --> 01:04:42,517
- So you want to prove you exist.
- Yeah, I do.

797
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,683
I got things inside my head
that don't make sense.

798
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:47,225
Dreams about my dad.

799
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:50,017
Look, as your
commanding officer,

800
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,517
it is my duty to report you

801
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,850
for letting two Eels
go free today.

802
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,933
And if I do that, you will
be tried for treason.

803
01:04:58,017 --> 01:05:01,350
And there will be nothing
I can do to protect you.

804
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:05,142
You betray me...

805
01:05:05,225 --> 01:05:07,017
and I will burn you.

806
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,600
And then I will
burn your ashes.

807
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:16,350
Dreams are a terror, son.
I know.

808
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:20,475
But it's just your mind
flingin' itself to pieces.

809
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:24,891
Just stand back
from the centrifuge, OK?

810
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:27,225
You have a virus.

811
01:05:27,309 --> 01:05:28,350
Go home...

812
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:29,808
and rest.

813
01:05:31,142 --> 01:05:32,683
Take a hot bath.

814
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:37,808
And then you report
to work tomorrow.

815
01:05:37,891 --> 01:05:39,808
But don't make me
come get you.

816
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:56,142
( clears throat )

817
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:01,891
Reactivate.

818
01:06:01,975 --> 01:06:03,434
Yuxie:
Hello, John.

819
01:06:03,517 --> 01:06:06,850
Yuxie, get me Fireman Douglas.

820
01:06:11,517 --> 01:06:14,309
Raven: Do your part.
See something, say something.

821
01:06:14,392 --> 01:06:17,142
Tell Yuxie. Together,
we will keep Cleveland...

822
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,975
( tires squeal )

823
01:06:30,808 --> 01:06:33,142
Montag. Get in.

824
01:06:42,891 --> 01:06:44,641
- How'd you find me?
- My friend Gustav...

825
01:06:44,725 --> 01:06:46,392
I'm no friend of his.

826
01:06:46,475 --> 01:06:48,225
Don't look at me.

827
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:50,933
- Don't fuckin' look at me!
- What's wrong with you?!

828
01:06:51,017 --> 01:06:52,368
You deleted my brother's life,
man!

829
01:06:52,392 --> 01:06:55,850
And you gave him 25 years!
You're scum!

830
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:57,225
Clarisse:
That's enough.

831
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,142
Gustavo: You better be
right about him.

832
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:07,808
Where we goin'?

833
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:09,535
To those people at the compound
I told you about.

834
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,641
- They want to see you.
- For what?

835
01:07:11,725 --> 01:07:15,392
- Something about the Omnis.
- Gustavo: Do it, or I will.

836
01:07:20,309 --> 01:07:21,559
You have to put this on.

837
01:07:46,475 --> 01:07:48,350
Who else was with 'em?

838
01:07:48,434 --> 01:07:51,142
Douglas: I don't know, sir.
Axix-Cam picked up Clarisse.

839
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:53,933
I knew Montag was a rat.
I told you he wasn't pure.

840
01:07:54,017 --> 01:07:55,641
I didn't ask your opinion!

841
01:07:55,725 --> 01:07:57,641
And the next time
I tell you to follow someone,

842
01:07:57,725 --> 01:07:59,933
you crawl into their asshole!

843
01:08:00,017 --> 01:08:01,559
You hear me?!

844
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:05,017
Report back to the station.

845
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,434
Yes, sir.

846
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:11,933
Yuxie:
This is a problem, John.

847
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:37,017
Clarisse told us
you stole this.

848
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,100
But when I see you
sitting there,

849
01:08:39,183 --> 01:08:41,142
all I can see is fire.

850
01:08:41,225 --> 01:08:45,683
You must be burning all these books,
and us, in your mind.

851
01:08:45,766 --> 01:08:47,891
Because you are what you are,

852
01:08:47,975 --> 01:08:50,142
and perhaps,
that's all you'll ever be...

853
01:08:50,225 --> 01:08:51,434
fire.

854
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:53,808
This man is just like
his Commandant Beatty.

855
01:08:53,891 --> 01:08:55,600
He's not to be trusted.

856
01:08:55,683 --> 01:08:58,475
Why did you burn books
your whole life?

857
01:08:58,559 --> 01:09:00,600
Because that's all I know.

858
01:09:00,683 --> 01:09:03,142
Deze man is
een stuk stront.

859
01:09:03,225 --> 01:09:05,850
But I want to do
something else.

860
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:07,850
Why?

861
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:16,850
When I look at that book,

862
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:19,183
it made me remember
when I was a kid.

863
01:09:20,975 --> 01:09:24,683
Just sittin' by the ocean...

864
01:09:24,766 --> 01:09:29,434
and I was trying to fill
this sieve with sand.

865
01:09:29,517 --> 01:09:33,725
But the faster I poured,
the faster the sand fell through it.

866
01:09:36,142 --> 01:09:37,891
Lookin' at the words
in that book,

867
01:09:37,975 --> 01:09:41,559
I felt like they... they were
passing right through me.

868
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:48,434
Like my whole life just...

869
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,808
passed right through me.

870
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:53,766
And that I missed it.

871
01:09:56,142 --> 01:09:59,058
I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

872
01:10:03,434 --> 01:10:05,766
Books are here
to remind us

873
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:07,975
what fools we can be.

874
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:11,350
But if we can remember,
if the Omnis can spread,

875
01:10:11,434 --> 01:10:14,641
then maybe we will win.

876
01:10:14,725 --> 01:10:16,725
The disconnected human mind

877
01:10:16,808 --> 01:10:21,017
is the last bastion
against the technological world.

878
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:25,600
It's the most secure place
to preserve these books.

879
01:10:25,683 --> 01:10:27,725
We're totally off the grid.

880
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:31,517
No computers, no way for
you to Firemen to track us

881
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,017
or enter our dreams.

882
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:37,058
Everything safely here.

883
01:10:37,142 --> 01:10:40,017
- You memorized all these books?
- We each memorize one,

884
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,100
and then we become the book.

885
01:10:42,183 --> 01:10:46,267
I am Toni Morrison.
"Song of Solomon."

886
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:48,517
He's "The Letters of Van Gogh."

887
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,600
She's Chairman Mao,
"The Little Red Book."

888
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:56,142
She's Rumi, Darwin,
"Anna Karenina."

889
01:10:56,225 --> 01:10:58,933
And she's half of
"A Yellow Sun."

890
01:10:59,017 --> 01:11:01,350
She's still memorizing it.

891
01:11:01,434 --> 01:11:04,683
In fact, you've met
one of us already.

892
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:09,392
You took this book
from her library.

893
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:13,142
She was John Steinbeck's
"The Grapes of Wrath"...

894
01:11:13,225 --> 01:11:16,850
now lost to humanity
forever.

895
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:20,225
But maybe from her death
we will gain something.

896
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,808
We haven't seen Clarisse
since she was a teen

897
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:26,017
when she was here
with her parents.

898
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:30,600
I believe you were memorizing
"White Teeth."

899
01:11:32,142 --> 01:11:34,683
And she tells us
you want to help.

900
01:11:34,766 --> 01:11:38,434
We have an important task
for you related to the Omnis.

901
01:11:38,517 --> 01:11:41,683
But we have to be sure
about you.

902
01:11:42,725 --> 01:11:45,058
Do you know this man?

903
01:11:45,142 --> 01:11:47,683
Fireman Hester.
Fourth District.

904
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:51,100
That's right.
He's in the back room, waiting for you.

905
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:53,975
And you're gonna
have to kill him.

906
01:11:54,058 --> 01:11:56,392
Clarisse:
You never told me that.

907
01:12:21,309 --> 01:12:23,058
He's through that door.

908
01:12:24,559 --> 01:12:28,142
A revolution
is not a dinner party.

909
01:12:28,225 --> 01:12:29,850
Good luck.

910
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,517
( door opens, closes )

911
01:12:37,725 --> 01:12:39,392
( switchblade clicks )

912
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:43,891
( clicks )

913
01:12:45,725 --> 01:12:47,933
( whispers )
They need you, they need you.

914
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,350
Stop!
Put it down!

915
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:26,975
Hey, man,
what the fuck is this?

916
01:13:27,058 --> 01:13:30,392
You did it.
It's over.

917
01:13:30,475 --> 01:13:32,808
I'm James Baldwin.

918
01:13:32,891 --> 01:13:35,475
"The Fire Next Time."
Welcome.

919
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,267
( leaves rustling )

920
01:14:23,517 --> 01:14:25,309
This way, please.

921
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:29,267
There's a young man,
Clifford,

922
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:30,350
in this barn,

923
01:14:30,434 --> 01:14:31,434
in transit to

924
01:14:31,517 --> 01:14:33,267
a group of scientists
in Canada,

925
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:35,058
and we need you to escort him

926
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:36,434
over the border.

927
01:14:36,517 --> 01:14:39,058
His mother was a geneticist
behind the Omnis.

928
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:41,891
Before she died,
she injected the DNA

929
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:44,725
into Clifford's pet bird.

930
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:47,267
- The Omnis is in a bird?
- Yes.

931
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:50,350
We need you to get
them both to safety.

932
01:14:54,517 --> 01:14:58,100
Woman: Clifford?
There's a man here to see you.

933
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:00,933
Clifford:
Eight. Tagore, Gitanjali,

934
01:15:01,017 --> 01:15:02,309
and poems by Tagore.

935
01:15:02,392 --> 01:15:03,975
It's number eight.

936
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:06,267
Clarisse:
Has he read all these books?

937
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:08,641
He's memorized
over 13,000 books.

938
01:15:08,725 --> 01:15:10,165
Clifford:
Pick up a book and test me.

939
01:15:10,225 --> 01:15:12,559
I won't look.
But you'll never win.

940
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:24,100
Read the title.

941
01:15:25,975 --> 01:15:28,475
- "Remembrance of Things..."
- Remembrance of Things Past."

942
01:15:28,559 --> 01:15:30,933
Marcel Proust, 1927.

943
01:15:31,017 --> 01:15:34,475
3,031 pages, seven volumes,

944
01:15:34,559 --> 01:15:38,225
1,267,069 words.

945
01:15:38,309 --> 01:15:39,683
Open it.

946
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,725
Open it.

947
01:15:48,017 --> 01:15:49,725
Page number... I'll turn around.

948
01:15:49,808 --> 01:15:51,475
No cheating. Page number?

949
01:15:51,559 --> 01:15:55,183
- Page 935.
- 935.

950
01:15:55,267 --> 01:15:57,100
Line 12. Go to line 12.

951
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:59,683
"So, as long as you distract
your mind from its dreams,

952
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:02,142
it will not know them
for what they are.

953
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:05,517
You will always be taken in
by the appearance of things,

954
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,766
because you will not have
grasped their true nature.

955
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:10,350
If dreaming is dangerous,

956
01:16:10,434 --> 01:16:13,100
then the cure for it
is not to dream less,

957
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:16,975
but to dream more,
to dream all the time."

958
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,225
Again, test...
test me again.

959
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:21,600
You'll lose.

960
01:16:30,475 --> 01:16:32,017
Oh, can I show him Lennie?

961
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,350
- Can I?
- Yes.

962
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,017
( chuckling ) Hey.
This is Lennie.

963
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:52,100
My sturnidae,
from the Latin sturnus.

964
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:55,309
Medium-sized passerine.
Very gregarious.

965
01:16:55,392 --> 01:16:58,058
Very beautiful.

966
01:16:58,142 --> 01:17:00,267
This is my Lennie.

967
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,434
( bird tweets )

968
01:17:05,975 --> 01:17:07,392
What's up, Lennie?

969
01:17:07,475 --> 01:17:09,517
( chirping )

970
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,475
Montag:
So, what's the next step?

971
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:13,434
We need a transponder.

972
01:17:13,517 --> 01:17:15,225
The scientists in Canada

973
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:17,058
are transmitting a homing signal

974
01:17:17,142 --> 01:17:18,891
that will call to a transponder.

975
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,267
Can you get one
and come back tonight?

976
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:22,850
Yes.

977
01:17:22,933 --> 01:17:24,392
What are they gonna do
with the bird?

978
01:17:24,475 --> 01:17:27,600
They're waiting to extract
the DNA with the Omnis,

979
01:17:27,683 --> 01:17:28,808
duplicate it,

980
01:17:28,891 --> 01:17:31,434
and then inject
all other animals

981
01:17:31,517 --> 01:17:35,683
so that knowledge
can spread and multiply.

982
01:17:35,766 --> 01:17:37,392
And cover the world.

983
01:17:37,475 --> 01:17:39,309
You'd better hurry.

984
01:17:45,975 --> 01:17:47,309
( gasps )

985
01:17:47,392 --> 01:17:49,891
( panting )

986
01:18:10,058 --> 01:18:13,225
( alarm wailing )

987
01:18:41,058 --> 01:18:42,975
- ( beeps )
- ( lock clicks )

988
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:48,641
( beeps )

989
01:18:54,475 --> 01:18:56,766
( beeping )

990
01:19:04,267 --> 01:19:06,475
Beatty:
Master Trooper.

991
01:19:12,142 --> 01:19:14,142
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

992
01:19:14,225 --> 01:19:16,808
- Are you over your sickness?
- Yeah.

993
01:19:16,891 --> 01:19:18,559
You were right.
I just needed to rest.

994
01:19:18,641 --> 01:19:21,058
- I'm feelin' 100 now.
- Beautiful.

995
01:19:21,142 --> 01:19:23,309
- So you're with us.
- Yes, sir.

996
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:25,725
We need to find the Omnis.
Any leads?

997
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:31,100
Yuxie, have Fireman Douglas
and his squad report.

998
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,267
Raid time.
I'm ready to gear up.

999
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,434
What does two times two equal?

1000
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:42,975
Excuse me?

1001
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:46,350
Four.

1002
01:19:46,434 --> 01:19:48,475
Why? What's wrong?

1003
01:19:51,766 --> 01:19:53,891
Is that all
you have to say to me?

1004
01:19:53,975 --> 01:19:56,142
Of course.

1005
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:58,933
John, just talk to me.
What's goin' on?

1006
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:02,350
I, too, burn with desire.

1007
01:20:04,017 --> 01:20:08,683
But I would rather walk with
my brother in the darkness

1008
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:10,975
than go alone in the light.

1009
01:20:11,058 --> 01:20:14,017
- Sir.
- Whatever happens tonight, Guy,

1010
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,225
you should know I would
rather walk with my brother.

1011
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,850
( footsteps approach )

1012
01:20:23,683 --> 01:20:25,641
Douglas,
report, please.

1013
01:20:26,683 --> 01:20:28,267
Found this
in the locker room, sir.

1014
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:29,975
Beatty: Whose locker
did you find it in?

1015
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,766
Nobody's. It was
just on the floor.

1016
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:33,725
Like a dead rat.

1017
01:20:33,808 --> 01:20:35,225
Take it!

1018
01:20:35,309 --> 01:20:37,017
That's an order.

1019
01:20:38,725 --> 01:20:42,100
Go on. Read us
a bedtime story.

1020
01:20:42,183 --> 01:20:43,701
- ( lighter clicks )
- Let's burn this shit.

1021
01:20:43,725 --> 01:20:44,808
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1022
01:20:44,891 --> 01:20:47,475
A special tip came
directly to me tonight.

1023
01:20:47,559 --> 01:20:50,142
Might be a good lead
on the Omnis.

1024
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:53,225
But let's finish
this little business first.

1025
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:55,058
Open the book.

1026
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:59,142
Oh, my.
Your pulse is really racing.

1027
01:20:59,225 --> 01:21:02,475
Steady now, Montag.
I wouldn't want to burn your hand off.

1028
01:21:02,559 --> 01:21:05,559
Now read.
Read to me.

1029
01:21:07,517 --> 01:21:11,475
"To go wrong
in one's own way

1030
01:21:11,559 --> 01:21:14,891
is better than to go right
in someone else's.

1031
01:21:16,725 --> 01:21:21,350
Taking a new step,
uttering a new word...

1032
01:21:21,434 --> 01:21:22,725
( snaps lighter shut )

1033
01:21:24,392 --> 01:21:27,058
...is what people
fear the most."

1034
01:21:27,142 --> 01:21:29,517
All those silly words,

1035
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,517
those false promises,
the timeworn philosophies.

1036
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,183
It's like chain-smoking,
chapter by chapter.

1037
01:21:38,267 --> 01:21:41,808
- Go on. Don't stop reading to me.
- Sir.

1038
01:21:41,891 --> 01:21:43,600
Next page!

1039
01:21:47,641 --> 01:21:49,850
"Did you think
that one tiny crime...

1040
01:21:49,933 --> 01:21:51,725
( lighter clicks )

1041
01:21:51,808 --> 01:21:55,891
...would be wiped out
by thousands of good deeds?

1042
01:21:55,975 --> 01:21:58,766
That there would be
no punishment?"

1043
01:22:04,891 --> 01:22:06,975
A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.

1044
01:22:07,058 --> 01:22:09,808
You read a few lines, and you're
ready to blow up the world,

1045
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:12,434
chop heads off,
destroy authority.

1046
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:16,100
I know.
I've been through it all.

1047
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:20,933
Now, what do you want to do?

1048
01:22:26,017 --> 01:22:28,058
I want to burn.

1049
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:29,475
Hmm.

1050
01:22:30,683 --> 01:22:33,350
Montag.

1051
01:22:33,434 --> 01:22:34,559
My brother.

1052
01:22:34,641 --> 01:22:36,183
Let's burn.

1053
01:23:09,766 --> 01:23:11,559
Raven:
Good evening, Cleveland.

1054
01:23:11,641 --> 01:23:13,683
Live outside
Master Trooper Montag's home

1055
01:23:13,766 --> 01:23:15,891
where shocking events
are unfolding.

1056
01:23:17,683 --> 01:23:20,683
Montag! Do you have anything
to say to your fans?

1057
01:23:22,309 --> 01:23:23,350
Montag.

1058
01:23:23,434 --> 01:23:26,183
Something the matter,
Montag?

1059
01:23:30,142 --> 01:23:33,350
You wanted to fly
near the sun.

1060
01:23:33,434 --> 01:23:36,183
You burn your damn wings off
and you wonder why.

1061
01:23:38,058 --> 01:23:41,725
Go in. I'll give you a minute
to get your house in order.

1062
01:23:43,475 --> 01:23:44,933
Go on.

1063
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,725
No one is lookin' out
for you now, boy.

1064
01:24:14,017 --> 01:24:19,142
Yuxie: Hello, Montag.
This is rather unfortunate.

1065
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:21,267
Some people would like
to see you.

1066
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:32,017
That's quite a collection
of graffiti you have there.

1067
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:34,808
Your fans deserve
an explanation.

1068
01:24:34,891 --> 01:24:37,600
These aren't mine.
You set me up!

1069
01:24:39,142 --> 01:24:41,475
( footsteps approach )

1070
01:24:41,559 --> 01:24:44,517
Welcome, John.
I've been waiting for you.

1071
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,225
Yuxie, go dark.

1072
01:24:49,267 --> 01:24:53,350
I told you I would burn you
if you betrayed me.

1073
01:24:53,434 --> 01:24:55,891
And this...

1074
01:24:55,975 --> 01:24:58,309
this is the big dance.

1075
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:02,100
Douglas. Stone.

1076
01:25:02,183 --> 01:25:05,933
Yuxie! Let the fire show begin.

1077
01:25:07,309 --> 01:25:11,392
Now, you do what
you are trained to do.

1078
01:25:11,475 --> 01:25:13,725
All you know how to do.

1079
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:15,309
Burn.

1080
01:26:01,142 --> 01:26:03,183
( panting )

1081
01:26:04,891 --> 01:26:07,725
You're not finished.
Go on.

1082
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:30,017
( panting )

1083
01:26:32,559 --> 01:26:34,725
Free yourself.

1084
01:27:05,933 --> 01:27:08,183
Let's light him up.

1085
01:27:08,267 --> 01:27:11,183
Tell your fans
what time it is.

1086
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:13,517
All: It's time to burn
for America again!

1087
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,517
Say it, Montag.

1088
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,183
- ( crowd jeering )
- Say it!

1089
01:27:17,267 --> 01:27:18,933
Woman:
Spit it out! Come on!

1090
01:27:23,933 --> 01:27:25,225
Come on, Captain.

1091
01:27:29,766 --> 01:27:31,559
Why did you do this?

1092
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:35,475
- What did you find? Chaos.
- ( clamp clicks )

1093
01:27:35,559 --> 01:27:37,475
( device humming )

1094
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:45,766
The Salamander
eats its own tail.

1095
01:27:48,309 --> 01:27:50,933
Master Trooper Douglas.

1096
01:27:51,017 --> 01:27:52,891
Master Trooper Douglas
reporting, sir.

1097
01:27:52,975 --> 01:27:55,891
- Tell us what you saw.
- Montag getting into a car

1098
01:27:55,975 --> 01:27:58,392
with Clarisse McClellan
and two known Eels.

1099
01:27:58,475 --> 01:28:00,641
Beatty: No wonder you've been
so eloquent lately.

1100
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:03,683
But you're still
the same dog I raised,

1101
01:28:03,766 --> 01:28:07,600
just barking
at someone else's command.

1102
01:28:07,683 --> 01:28:10,267
Gather a squad,
find Clarisse and the other Eels

1103
01:28:10,350 --> 01:28:12,142
- and bring them to me.
- Yes, sir.

1104
01:28:14,517 --> 01:28:18,850
- Montag! Stop! Let it go! Drop it!
- Montag: Drop it, Douglas!

1105
01:28:18,933 --> 01:28:21,600
Well, that's one way
to win your fans back.

1106
01:28:21,683 --> 01:28:23,766
Beatty: Hold fire
till your brother speaks.

1107
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,808
- Drop it, Douglas.
- Beatty: Go ahead,

1108
01:28:25,891 --> 01:28:27,371
pull the trigger,
let Douglas have it.

1109
01:28:27,434 --> 01:28:29,017
- Captain.
- Quiet, Douglas!

1110
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,641
Could it be existence
is our exile

1111
01:28:31,725 --> 01:28:33,559
and nothingness is our home?

1112
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,100
Fire is your home, Montag.

1113
01:28:35,183 --> 01:28:37,309
- Burn away.
- No, Captain, please!

1114
01:28:37,392 --> 01:28:40,183
What is called
a reason for living is also

1115
01:28:40,267 --> 01:28:42,850
an excellent reason
for dying.

1116
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,350
( screaming )

1117
01:28:55,975 --> 01:29:00,600
( Douglas continues screaming )

1118
01:29:12,559 --> 01:29:15,517
Montag, you did it.

1119
01:29:16,891 --> 01:29:18,392
You did it.

1120
01:29:31,058 --> 01:29:33,559
( panting )

1121
01:29:33,641 --> 01:29:35,392
Choice.

1122
01:29:42,183 --> 01:29:45,559
( onlookers scream )

1123
01:29:50,725 --> 01:29:52,350
Beatty:
Dear Natives.

1124
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:53,766
Eel Montag,

1125
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:55,350
murderer Montag,

1126
01:29:55,434 --> 01:29:56,725
terrorist Montag,

1127
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:00,517
has committed treason
against our nation.

1128
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,142
Eyes on Axis-Cam,
eyes on the 9,

1129
01:30:03,225 --> 01:30:04,891
and report where
this terrorist is.

1130
01:30:04,975 --> 01:30:08,183
Terrorist Montag...
could he have the Omnis?

1131
01:30:08,267 --> 01:30:10,267
Stay vivid to find out.

1132
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:33,517
- Montag: Where's Gustavo?
- Clarisse: They arrested him.

1133
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,641
Transponder?

1134
01:30:35,725 --> 01:30:37,808
( beeps )

1135
01:30:40,975 --> 01:30:44,142
- Page 93.
- 93.

1136
01:30:49,267 --> 01:30:52,850
"I bequeath myself
to the dirt

1137
01:30:52,933 --> 01:30:55,434
to grow from
the grass I love.

1138
01:30:55,517 --> 01:30:59,766
If you want me again,
look for me under your boot soles.

1139
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:03,891
You will hardly know who I am
or what I mean,

1140
01:31:03,975 --> 01:31:06,933
but I shall be good help
to you nevertheless,

1141
01:31:07,017 --> 01:31:10,434
and filter and fiber
your blood.

1142
01:31:10,517 --> 01:31:14,434
Failing to fetch me at first,
keep encouraged.

1143
01:31:14,517 --> 01:31:18,183
Missing me one place,
search another.

1144
01:31:18,267 --> 01:31:22,267
I stop somewhere,
waiting for you."

1145
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:25,058
Yuxie: Found him.
He's heading to this black hole

1146
01:31:25,142 --> 01:31:26,434
outside Talay City.

1147
01:31:26,517 --> 01:31:29,350
Rerouting for
fastest arrival.

1148
01:31:30,975 --> 01:31:32,517
( engine revving )

1149
01:31:42,392 --> 01:31:45,683
- ( vehicles approach )
- Clifford, run!

1150
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:48,350
- ( panicked shouting )
- Clifford!

1151
01:31:54,058 --> 01:31:55,183
( air brakes hiss )

1152
01:31:57,933 --> 01:32:00,058
( all shouting )

1153
01:32:27,933 --> 01:32:29,309
( Firemen shouting at Eels )

1154
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:35,475
Male Eel: Get out of here!
Run! Run!

1155
01:32:35,559 --> 01:32:36,891
- Toni!
- Fireman: Don't you move!

1156
01:32:36,975 --> 01:32:40,392
- Get down!
- Get off of her!

1157
01:32:48,309 --> 01:32:52,559
Come on. Get up,
we gotta go.

1158
01:32:52,641 --> 01:32:53,933
Come on.

1159
01:33:15,808 --> 01:33:18,475
- ( flames whoosh )
- Fireman: Stand still!

1160
01:33:22,517 --> 01:33:26,434
Fireman: When I ask you not to move,
that means don't move!

1161
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,808
( fire whooshing )

1162
01:33:52,517 --> 01:33:54,267
Hey. Clifford.

1163
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:55,683
Hey. Come on.

1164
01:33:58,350 --> 01:33:59,683
( bird chirps )

1165
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,683
( transponder beeps )

1166
01:34:21,641 --> 01:34:25,017
( chirping)

1167
01:34:28,850 --> 01:34:30,559
( chirping )

1168
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,225
Omnis?

1169
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:55,725
Stop.

1170
01:34:57,891 --> 01:35:00,475
I command you, Montag.

1171
01:35:00,559 --> 01:35:02,559
Stop.

1172
01:35:06,683 --> 01:35:08,725
( chirping )

1173
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:29,975
( wings flapping )

1174
01:36:09,142 --> 01:36:11,975
( music playing,
no audible scream )

1175
01:36:32,434 --> 01:36:34,475
( wings flapping )

1176
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:12,350
( music playing )

1177
01:37:46,058 --> 01:37:48,434
( music playing )
