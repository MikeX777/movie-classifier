3
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,649
<i>Downright dirty!</i>

4
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:25,235
<i>You all played dirty tricks on me!</i>

5
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,111
<i>My Kotetsu!</i>

6
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,780
<i>Where's my Kotetsu?</i>

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,283
Your proud Kotetsu
is here, right here.

8
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,789
I'm falling!

9
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,583
No! I'm being sucked in!

10
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,294
Calm down and stand up!

11
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,922
Oh no...
I'm scared...

12
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,842
Don't you know that
I'm scared of heights?

13
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:53,179
Why trip over
in a place like this?

14
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,598
I can't see what kind of place
this is.

15
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,225
Don't quibble!

16
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:03,690
Senkichi-san.

17
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,818
Hey.

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,832
Hang in, we're almost there!

19
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:22,458
I'll do my best.

20
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,544
That hot spring will cure you.

21
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:28,089
I can't stand this anymore!

22
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,718
Where's my Kotetsu?

23
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,095
I checked it at the door.

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,847
I want it back!

25
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:39,726
Who do you think I am...

26
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,062
Expelled from Osaka
for killing a man,

27
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,939
I'm Senkichi of Kotetsu!

28
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,983
Here's your dagger.

29
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:51,070
I knew what you were up to
from the very start!

30
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,114
That'll show you. Kill him!

31
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:23,019
What? He went that way?

32
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,521
You sure?
But you're blind.

33
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,565
Anyway, over there! Move!

34
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,230
Are you Orin?

35
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,358
Why on earth are you here?

36
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:16,239
What happened between us
was just a one night stand.

37
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,616
I told you to leave!

38
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,326
Otherwise...

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,080
Hold on to my shoulder.

40
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,002
Wait a second!

41
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,715
The money...
the money's gonna fall out.

42
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:44,892
Those bastards!

43
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:51,649
At least I've managed to pilfer
their door money!

44
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,390
At last...

45
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,478
Hey...

46
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:38,529
Orin...

47
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:43,743
Where do you think you're
putting your hand?

48
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:46,412
On your back.

49
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,122
That, I know.

50
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,417
Right where your hand is,

51
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:56,547
is Ono no Komachi's face,
on my tattoo.

52
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,050
Her face...

53
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:03,763
is modelled after my late mother,
who died when I was a kid.

54
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,808
She's beautiful.

55
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,561
And my face looks a bit
like hers.

56
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,073
This hot spring...

57
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:24,200
In the olden days,

58
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,079
when Kai and Echigo...

59
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,289
went into a long war,

60
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:34,836
warriors in flight came
to this secret spot...

61
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,796
to heal their wounds.

62
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:40,800
Your wounds...

63
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,970
I will cure them here.

64
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:47,974
Oh, ouch!

65
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,105
When I was a kid,

66
00:05:55,982 --> 00:06:00,361
my late mother and I would,
hand in hand,

67
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,615
drift through Shinano and Koshiji,

68
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,328
in the bitter cold of
the blowing snow,

69
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:12,123
listening to the sound...

70
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,626
of the freezing,
turbulent waves breaking.

71
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:22,341
My mother was deceived
by my father,

72
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,510
who was a Ronin.

73
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:30,016
She could never return
to her native Osaka,

74
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,520
and had to die on the road.

75
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:42,153
With her dying words she
told me to go to Osaka,

76
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,655
where my grandparents lived.

77
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,782
They brought me up.

78
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,119
Senkichi-san...

79
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:57,251
That's the very first time
that you've told me about yourself.

80
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:00,671
Isn't it?

81
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,926
I...

82
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,806
despise anyone who does
bad things to women!

83
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,684
Anyone who cheats a woman!

84
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,771
That's why I... you see?

85
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,774
Well, it's my choice...

86
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,819
One night stand or not,
you offered me sincere mercy.

87
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,198
I'm only placing a bet on this
happiness you've given me!

88
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,284
A bet? Gambling is strictly
men's business!

89
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,537
- How dare a woman...
- I placed a bet anyway!

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,499
They're no better than beggars.

108
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,336
- Just a wasted...
- It's all right.

109
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,504
They might have some.

110
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,840
We are imperialist samurai.

111
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,511
We need funds in order to go to Kyoto
and contribute to the Sonno-joi.

112
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,639
So stand and deliver!

113
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,350
No talking back.

114
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:09,772
Just make yourself amenable.

115
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,240
Why make a fuss and draw
your sword?

116
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:30,292
Hey... They're samurai.

117
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,795
I can hear there are
three of them.

118
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,797
Even you won't be able to...

119
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,508
You'd be ruined if you put up
a fight.

120
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,176
Here.

121
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,928
Okay, I know.

122
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,147
Please, take this.

123
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,024
This is all we have.

124
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,280
Oh dear!

125
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:01,949
Oh dear.

126
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,076
Oh dear.

127
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,212
Oh dear.

128
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,174
What's that on your back?
Let me see.

129
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,344
Well, urn...

130
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,222
I'm ready to give you
anything you want.

131
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,725
But please,
this is his precious...

132
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,728
A sword, isn't it?
Give it here.

133
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,230
- Give it to me.
- Woman.

134
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:38,319
We'll take you, to compensate
for the shortfall in our war fund.

135
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,197
And you! We'll slay you
as a precaution.

136
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:43,574
Come on!

137
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,831
Don't worry,
we'll fill her with pleasure...

138
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,250
before we sell her off.

139
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,879
So get that thing off
your back, quick!

140
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:58,714
What's wrong?

141
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,760
Sakichi-san!

142
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,512
Please, don't hurt him!

143
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,723
I don't care if you...

144
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,269
Let go of Orin!

145
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:15,791
Hey...

146
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:27,719
Orin...

147
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,974
I killed, once again...

148
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,354
I killed a man in Osaka,

149
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,858
and I've been expelled...

150
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,069
from the whole region
for a period of three years.

151
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:49,741
And that period will be over
this autumn.

152
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:52,870
And yet...

153
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,581
I messed up, again...

154
00:15:59,001 --> 00:15:59,877
But...

155
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:05,382
such uncaring,
inconsiderate, cruel,

156
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,719
filthy bastards are unforgivable!

157
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,351
Senkichi-san...

158
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,898
Thank you.

159
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,610
Thank you.

160
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,907
- I'm happy.
- I owe you my life.

161
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,533
It's only natural.

162
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,036
Thank you!

163
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,173
Hey...

164
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,012
- We shouldn't be staying here.
- No.

165
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,433
If anyone should see us,
I'd be in big trouble.

166
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,771
Watch your step.

167
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,024
Don't move.

168
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,615
A clay bell?

169
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,411
I wonder why I picked this up.

170
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:25,295
Orin...

171
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,007
I give up. You win.

172
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,887
Now that it's come to this...

173
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,558
I too, will bet on you.

174
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:45,190
I will bet on you and make
you a happy woman, in Kyoto.

175
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,279
Let me carry you there.

176
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,673
Senkichi-san,

177
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,718
the seam on your sleeve
is coming undone.

178
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,429
Let me get down;
I'll stitch it up.

179
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,222
Leave it, I don't mind.

180
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,849
It will look bad.

181
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,350
Let me get down.

182
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:12,903
Orin.

183
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,614
What is it?

184
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,783
I just called.

185
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,439
MEANWHILE, KYOTO WAS...

186
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:57,322
A CITY OF SAMURAI ASSASSINATIONS

187
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,418
ON JULY 20,1862,

188
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,295
SAKON SHIMADA, A PRO-COALITION RETAINER

189
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,424
WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHINBEI TANAKA

190
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,552
AND HIS SATSUMA COMPATRIOTS

191
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,729
THIS WAS AN INTERNAL STRIFE.

192
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:31,690
AMONG THE SONNO-JOI FACTION

193
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:33,859
ON AUGUST 21,

194
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,820
SEIICHIRO HONMA FROM ECHIGO,

195
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,865
WAS ASSASSINATED.

196
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,255
ON AUGUST 30,
MEAKASHI BUNKICHI WAS STRANGLED

197
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,467
BY IZO OKADA AND HIS
TOSA COMPATRIOTS

198
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:10,228
SEPTEMBER 23 - ISHIBE POST STATION

199
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,304
- Here they come!
- Where?

200
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,183
Here they come!

201
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,566
TRAITORS

202
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,074
Wait a minute, Orin.

203
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:08,912
I might need to recite a
<i>jingi</i> greeting...

204
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,705
I'm no good at that.

205
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,041
You've always been a gambler.

206
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,460
Aren't you able to recite one?

207
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,587
No, I just can't.

208
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,714
I'm sorry.

209
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,341
You know...

210
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,219
those phrases are the
same with everybody.

211
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,429
You just have to memorize it.

212
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,306
I don't like it that way.

213
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,601
That's why I never got to
memorize the whole thing.

214
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,478
Oh dear...

215
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,482
Let's go to a quiet place.

216
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,361
You can recite the phrases
while I play the shamisen,

217
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,947
just like singing a song. Okay?

218
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,869
Okay, but not here.

219
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,120
Let's go.

220
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:56,626
Here.

221
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,963
OGAKI-YA

222
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,595
I am a traveling man.

223
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,014
Excuse me.

224
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,766
Excuse me.

225
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,019
<i>Coming!</i>

226
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,353
Ready?

227
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,401
Good day, sir.
Who are you?

228
00:23:25,864 --> 00:23:26,990
What's up?

229
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:29,784
"May l..."

230
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,996
May I come into your property?

231
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,539
Certainly, please.

232
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,174
Pardon my bothering you.

233
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,176
Just a moment... hey!

234
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,636
Quiet, please!

235
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,929
- Hey.
- Eh?

236
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,805
You interrupted me.

237
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,683
Now, let me take it from
the start.

238
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,435
Please, go back inside.

239
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:58,897
Hey... Mister.

240
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:01,316
That's an unusual thing to do.

241
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,026
You've got to let me.

242
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,653
Otherwise it won't...

243
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,572
Start all over again, huh?

244
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,699
How weird!

245
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:13,703
You ready?

246
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,914
It's alright with me!

247
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,082
Hey.

248
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,417
Who's that talking?

249
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,087
Is that Oburoshiki?

250
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,215
I wonder what that brat is
blabbering about.

251
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:35,475
Pardon my bothering you.

252
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:38,478
I shall listen.

253
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,230
Pardon my bothering you.

254
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,065
I shall listen.

255
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,609
Pardon my bothering you.

256
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,112
Well, I shall listen.

257
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,863
Pardon my bothering you.

258
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:51,574
I shall listen.

259
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,201
Pardon my bothering you.

260
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,577
I shall listen.

261
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:56,955
Pardon my bothering you.

262
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:58,999
I shall listen.

263
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,084
Pardon my bothering you.

264
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,586
I shall listen.

265
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,755
Pardon my bothering you.

266
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,215
I shall listen.

267
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,009
Pardon my bothering you.

268
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,469
I shall listen.

269
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,764
Pardon my bothering you.

270
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,101
- Oh, boss.
- What?

271
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,103
A funny guy just came.

272
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,397
He asks for your favour.

273
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:23,648
No way.

274
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,026
I'm about to go out.

275
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,277
Yes...

276
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:31,406
Here, come in.

277
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:43,793
Boss. He says...

278
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,547
this is a letter of recommendation.

279
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,301
Hey.

280
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,428
This is Ane-san <i>(boss' wife).</i>

281
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,304
Hello.

282
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:59,017
What a dirty piece of paper
you've brought me here...

283
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,063
- Barely readable!
- It used to be readable.

284
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:06,524
- When was that?
- Two years ago.

285
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:07,817
You idiot!

286
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,152
You idiot!

287
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,030
So, tell me...

288
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,908
You wanted to see me in person?

289
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,701
You want to be my kobun?

290
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:19,579
- No, that's not it.
- Then what?

291
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,832
The thing is,
Oyabun and Ane-san...

292
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,835
I have a companion here,
named Orin.

293
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,213
I bet my heart on her.

294
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:30,590
I came to Kyoto in my bid to...

295
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,343
make her a happy woman.

296
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,471
If I drink the cup of brotherhood
to become your kobun,

297
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,932
I will have to stake my life on you,

298
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,309
according to the code of loyalty.

299
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:45,188
It's not in my nature to lie.

300
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:50,193
Now, my top priority must be Orin.

301
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,987
Hey. What's your point?

302
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,614
Vending.

303
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,870
Your employment agency runs a lounge
for the workmen, with a gambling den.

304
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,581
Please allow me to sell food there.

305
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,835
I wish to make money that way,

306
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,879
and not by fighting and gambling,
so as to make Orin happy.

307
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,714
Beautiful!

308
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:15,385
I like your idea -
'to make a woman happy.'

309
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,263
Go for it. Sell food? Great!

310
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:20,265
Sake, sushi, sweets...

311
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,142
You wouldn't be a kobun...

312
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,769
for Orin's sake?
I like that part, too!

313
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,771
No place to live?
Leave it to me.

314
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,398
Hey, I'm the boss here.

315
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:31,776
- Are you against it?
- No one said that!

316
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:35,530
Sorry to interrupt,
but is it a yes or no?

317
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:39,033
- A little patience.
- Yes.

318
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:46,499
AFTER THE FIRST MONTH OF PEDDLING

319
00:28:17,572 --> 00:28:19,282
- You idiot!
- Boss!

320
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:22,202
- A bad guy? How dare...
- Easy...

321
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,954
This is not just your
problem, understand?

322
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,540
I've no patience with guys like that!

323
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,959
Enough of the bullshit!
You little...

324
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,086
- I'll turn myself in.
- Idiot!

325
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,713
I never told you to!

326
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,925
I saw Orin-san in tears of joy,

327
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,802
saying that your expulsion
will be over this fall,

328
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:42,096
and that you will be free at last.

329
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:45,308
Your being a wanted criminal
again will devastate her!

330
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:48,603
Haven't you told us that you
want to make her happy!

331
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,980
Stop doing all the talking,
shut up!

332
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,359
But everyone is grateful
for this killing.

333
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,987
That thug Jagara was
pissing off our guests.

334
00:28:58,112 --> 00:28:59,572
Shut up, you fool!

335
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,366
Please calm down, boss.

336
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,369
What's this...

337
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,500
Got myself ready,
so I've come to...

338
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,002
Later! I'm busy now,
scolding him!

339
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,004
Boss, Oburoshiki is...

340
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,382
on his way to Kishu at your behest.

341
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,342
- Boss!
- Darling!

342
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,887
You took on an assignment to
take care of the huge amount of...

343
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,140
lumber needed to build two mansions...

344
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:29,978
for the Lord of Aizu Domain,
who has to mobilize all his men...

345
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,273
and set up an office in Kyoto
upon being appointed...

346
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,149
a Military Commissioner.

347
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,654
<i>The Chamberlain himself offered
you this assignment, right?</i>

348
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,614
<i>And you've ordered Oburoshiki...</i>

349
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:45,410
<i>to go off to Kishu and work
with the local lumber dealer.</i>

350
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,371
Did you forget what you told
him to do?

351
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:50,790
It's all right.
Hey, Kotetsu!

352
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,543
Don't you ever cause trouble
for our boss and Ane-san!

353
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,295
Nor for Orin-san!

354
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,131
But I heard you're really strong...

355
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,799
What's keeping you? Go!

356
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,801
- Yes.
- Take care.

357
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,178
Hey, Senkichi, you bastard...

358
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,018
Idiot!

359
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,937
Listen, I'll manage the rest,

360
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,065
so forget about peddling and
lie low for now, okay?

361
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,191
- You.
- Yes?

362
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:20,570
Put your sandals on and take
him to Orin-san...

363
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,405
before leaving, okay?

364
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,823
- Yes.
- Good!

365
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:25,908
I am very sorry.

366
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,535
What a brat...

367
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,957
Ane-san... I'm sorry.

368
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,584
Move it, will you?

369
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:38,921
Hurry UP-

370
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,677
Orin-san? Morning!

371
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,471
I've brought you Kotetsu.

372
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:48,097
Orin, I'm home.

373
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,101
Orin-san.

374
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,062
Orin-san?

375
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:57,357
Where is she?

376
00:30:57,607 --> 00:30:58,733
Orin-san?

377
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,068
Orin?

378
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,114
Orin-san?

379
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,619
Kotetsu-san! ls Orin-san in?

380
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:12,622
- Aguri-chan, what's up with Orin?
- What's up?

381
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,000
Just now,
seeing you two come back,

382
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,461
my father...
when he opened his shop up,

383
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:22,840
the watchman on the corner came
to him and said he saw...

384
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,759
a blind lady in goze attire...

385
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:27,095
heading east,
so father sent me...

386
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,847
to tell you she might be
Kotetsu-san's wife...

387
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:33,267
- Aguri-chan, when was that?
- Tell me, when was it?

388
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:34,769
Hey, let her talk!

389
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,521
It was a while ago.

390
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:39,357
Kotetsu.

391
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,154
Look.

392
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:56,416
This is the kimono she's sewn for me.

393
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,502
She...

394
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,505
Kotetsu! Wait a second.

395
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,048
Wait.

396
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,509
Look.

397
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,679
Do you know what this means?

398
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,557
- What's this?
- No idea.

399
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,808
Hey, look.

400
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,395
This is a message from Orin-san.

401
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,313
A letter for you.

402
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,191
What's this?

403
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:25,278
- A tabi (sock).
- Tabi (travel)?

404
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,448
This is a masu (measuring cup).

405
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,534
And this?

406
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,078
<i>Tsuma-yoji</i> (toothpick).

407
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:36,539
Tsuma (wife) yoji (errands)-

408
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:37,582
Broken.

409
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,922
Hey! Listen up.

410
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:46,090
Okay? Now...

411
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,468
Tabi = travel.

412
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,470
Kaetta (upside down) masu.

413
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:52,430
Kaeri-masu = I'm leaving.

414
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,849
Dorin (clay bell) = Orin.

415
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,559
Wait! Wait up!

416
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:58,686
- You said east, right?
- Yes.

417
00:32:58,811 --> 00:32:59,979
Awata-guchi.

418
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:01,481
Keage. Hino-oka.

419
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:03,107
Osaka-yama. Go, run!

420
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,484
- Orin!
- Run!

421
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:06,194
Hurry up! Run!

422
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:07,236
Quick!

423
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:32,595
It's you...

424
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:41,979
But Why?

425
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:50,780
A woman like me ought not
be with you past the fall.

426
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,908
And fall is nearing its end.

427
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,371
You can return to Osaka,
to Shimanouchi where...

428
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,915
your grandparents are waiting,

429
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,919
and be a young master
of Tanba-ya, a wholesale mercer.

430
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:08,631
Or you can pledge loyalty to...

431
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,968
the Oyabun of Ogaki-ya and
be a member of his family.

432
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:15,680
It will surely make a man
out of you.

433
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,103
A woman like me can't
stand in your way...

434
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,438
Shut up! You're wrong!

435
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:29,443
If you leave me now,
what will become of my bet?

436
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,320
I'll have to lose!

437
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,365
I won't gamble!

438
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,701
I promise.
I won't fight, either!

439
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:37,868
Hey, you!

440
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:39,829
Nice day, isn't it?

441
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:44,250
In gambling,
only the bookie makes money.

442
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,877
I know that very well,
from my own experience.

443
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:48,879
So, let's go.

444
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,852
Oops. Not the bridge.

445
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,854
It'd be a long way round.

446
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,023
Let's go along the river.

447
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:14,864
I'm hungry, and you?
Roasted rice cake?

448
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,868
Hey. Are they roasted?

449
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,286
They are.

450
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,039
Give me two.

451
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:31,672
Ouch!

452
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:34,425
It's hot.

453
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,137
Fresh from the oven.

454
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:42,058
One bite and the filling will
burn your tongue.

455
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:50,941
River bank.

456
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,194
River bank, indeed.

457
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,958
Very large river bank.

458
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,960
Quite large, indeed.

459
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,339
A perfect location.

460
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:15,925
Huh?

461
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:25,601
BUSINESS RESTART A FEW DAYS LATER

462
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,731
There, bring them down.

463
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,233
Ossan (old man)!

464
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:34,318
Right there, right there.

465
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:38,322
- That's all?
- Yes, that's all.

466
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,490
Good job.

467
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,450
Ossan! Are you alright?

468
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:42,993
Watch out!

469
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,995
Mind who you're talking to.

470
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,138
Ossan.

471
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:05,766
Now, all we have to do is
to bring in...

472
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,769
those tatami mats and
place them lengthwise.

473
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:11,856
Quicker than I thought.
You did a great job!

474
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,274
Hey, you.

475
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:20,030
You sound like you're
building a gambling den.

476
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,534
Sound like?
It is a gambling den!

477
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,537
We'll do good business here.
Grand opening soon!

478
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,039
That's nonsense.

479
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,418
Don't you know that...

480
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:36,422
this area is within the territory
of Nabari-ya of the Awata-guchi?

481
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,674
This sort of thing could get
you killed,

482
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,802
for violating their territory.

483
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,012
Eh?

484
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,516
Can't believe I've got
myself in such hot water!

485
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,811
Just because I sold you
two roasted rice cakes...

486
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,688
For pity's sake...

487
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,816
Oh, and mind you,

488
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,319
don't forget,
you owe me money!

489
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:00,905
- I know!
- You pay me back!

490
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,823
All right already, Ossan!

491
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,910
Ossan, don't worry!

492
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:09,789
By evening,
I'll pay you back double!

493
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,207
Gambling den!

494
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,292
A new gambling den!

495
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,295
It's open now!

496
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,548
What? Gambling?

497
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,342
Where is it?

498
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,302
Go and make money, Ossan!

499
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:27,848
Welcome!
Here, have a seat.

500
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:29,475
Please, make your bet!

501
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,478
You're the first customer:
it's your lucky day!

502
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,355
Well, no...

503
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,733
We came to ask you
to make us your kobuns.

504
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,610
My name is Kumagoro Ueba.

505
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:41,487
My name is Kotaro lroha.

506
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,113
I don't want no kobuns!

507
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,366
We saw you kill that thug, Jagara.

508
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:49,578
And we both decided our Oyabun
shall be no one else but you.

509
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,956
Use us as dealers and bookies.

510
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:54,124
No, I don't need no kobuns!

511
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,836
- Please...
- Oh, welcome!

512
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,755
Please, take a seat and play!

513
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:08,222
Who gave you permission
to do this?

514
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,266
Who's in charge here?
Step up!

515
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:12,268
- You're the one?
- Come on!

516
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,646
I'm in charge.
You got a problem?

517
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:18,399
- You...
- You look familiar...

518
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:22,027
My name is Hyorokudama,
from the Nabariya Family.

519
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,529
Follow me.

520
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:28,033
Come on!

521
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:32,788
Clear the way!

522
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:37,877
NABARI-YA

523
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:54,393
Oyabun! I'm coming!

524
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:32,222
Oyabun-san, Ane-san.

525
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:35,184
<i>I ask for your permission
in my obscure position.</i>

526
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:40,856
This is my first appearance
in your honourable presence today.

527
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,319
Accordingly, allow me to introduce
my humble self, from Senshu.

528
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,821
I was born in Sakai, Senshu.

529
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,365
My name is Gonji.

530
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:52,117
I go by the name of
Aka-mamushi ('Red Viper').

531
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:56,121
The late Jagara the Hairy and I
were brothers in the same family.

532
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,624
I am a person of little account.

533
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,752
From here on, please kindly...

534
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,588
accord me your acquaintance,

535
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,883
and grant me your support.

536
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:11,512
Even or odds?
Even or odds?

537
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,390
Even or odds?

538
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:15,391
Play.

539
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:17,726
2-5. Odds!

540
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:28,529
Next round.

541
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:30,739
Ane-san?

542
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,158
Kotestu.

543
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:34,284
Come here.

544
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,788
That's territory violation!

545
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,039
Why is that?

546
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:42,167
I just wanted to build a new
gambling den for the Ogaki-ya.

547
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,004
What's the problem with the place?

548
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:46,922
Across Kamo river,

549
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:50,551
the east side belongs to the Nabari-ya,
and the west to the Ogaki-ya.

550
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,804
- And what about the dry riverbed?
- Eh?

551
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:56,932
Does it belong to the Nabari-ya?
No...

552
00:41:57,182 --> 00:42:00,436
Nor does it belong to the Ogaki-ya.

553
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,563
It belongs to no one.

554
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,815
Hence my choice.

555
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,151
An ideal spot for business.

556
00:42:07,276 --> 00:42:09,194
Look what I made,
just for today.

557
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,946
Heaps of silver coins.

558
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:19,663
That's clever.
You're right about...

559
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:22,207
a riverbed belonging to no one.

560
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:23,333
Boss!

561
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,086
None of your quibbling!

562
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:29,465
A riverbed belongs to no one.

563
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,967
And it doesn't belong to you!

564
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,429
From the times of Emperor Kanmu,

565
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:38,307
it has belonged to
the whole city of Kyoto.

566
00:42:38,348 --> 00:42:41,935
A natural landmark of
this capital. You hear me?

567
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:42,811
Oh.

568
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:46,565
I will not allow you to
build your dirty hut there!

569
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,816
Tear it down!

570
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:50,819
And make sure to clean up
the place when you're done!

571
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:52,571
- Now move!
- Yes!

572
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:55,324
- Let's go!
- Yes!

573
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:07,628
Leave!

574
00:43:08,504 --> 00:43:11,006
You're suspended
until I say it's enough.

575
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,134
And don't leave this money
lying in front of me!

576
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,637
Take it with you and leave!

577
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:17,971
Listen...

578
00:43:18,097 --> 00:43:21,141
Don't you dare step outside
while on suspension,

579
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:25,354
or I'll hang you upside down,
gouge out your eyes and...

580
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,898
- Understand?
- Yes!

581
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:49,795
But say...

582
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:54,049
that brat's such a smart one,
isn't he?

583
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:55,300
Boss...

584
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,678
This isn't the best time to say that.

585
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:59,555
What about the Nabari-ya?

586
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,184
With the huge project
commissioned by Aizu ahead,

587
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,436
a conflict with the Nabari would...

588
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:10,440
You don't have to tell me.
I'm thinking about it.

589
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,903
<i>Kappore kappore</i>

590
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:17,322
<i>Dance with sweet tea</i>

591
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,950
<i>Dance with bitter tea</i>

592
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:39,469
<i>Life is hard for a subordinate</i>

593
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:44,224
<i>Looking for a pretty</i>

594
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,101
<i>lady to come</i>

595
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,313
- Hey...
- Shut up!

596
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,823
What's the matter?

597
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:00,949
Oyabun...

598
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,367
Oyabun...

599
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,747
I can't drink! No more!

600
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,585
Drank too much.
Can't stand up.

601
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:12,753
Pathetic!

602
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:22,471
Here...

603
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:26,266
Go to Miyagawa-cho
or Shimabara, wherever.

604
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:29,269
I'll make you my kobuns if
you can duly enjoy nightlife.

605
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:30,270
<i>Oyabun.</i>

606
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:33,357
Show me you can, otherwise
you're no kobuns of mine.

607
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:35,859
Eh?

608
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:38,278
Hurry, go! And have fun!

609
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,032
Hey, Kuma, let's go.

610
00:45:43,617 --> 00:45:45,035
Sorry, thanks!

611
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,536
I'm sorry, thanks!

612
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:56,630
I'm sorry, but thanks!

613
00:45:56,755 --> 00:45:58,423
I'm so, so sorry.

614
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,133
Thank you for this.

615
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:01,677
Orin.

616
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:03,804
Orin.

617
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,014
Here.

618
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,645
This is all yours to have.

619
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,816
Buy whatever you want with it.

620
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:19,403
But this is a lot!

621
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,321
I earned it...

622
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:26,201
for the sake of the Oyabun,
and for yours.

623
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:29,204
And yet... bullshit!

624
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,581
That nit-picking Oyabun...

625
00:46:34,084 --> 00:46:35,836
But... Orin,

626
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:41,300
that Oyabun is nothing like...

627
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:43,844
the ordinary gokudo Oyabuns...

628
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:47,472
you have around here these days.

629
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,060
He says that the Kamo
riverbanks have been,

630
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:55,105
from the times of Emperor Kanmu,

631
00:46:55,731 --> 00:47:00,694
natural assets that belong to
the entire city of Kyoto.

632
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:04,823
He has such a broad vision!

633
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,579
I was totally convinced.

634
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:24,760
Hey.

635
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:29,222
If you want to sleep,
I'll make your bed.

636
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:58,728
Who is it?

637
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,195
Watch out!

638
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,617
Get out of the way!

639
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:16,997
Wake up!

640
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:04,669
Someone!
Run to the Ogaki-ya!

641
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:09,674
Back off!

642
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,809
Brother!

643
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,437
We're going ahead!

644
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,586
Stop throwing stones at me!

645
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:55,720
Hey, Kotetsu!

646
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:59,099
Someday I'll get you
and finish you off!

647
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,726
Hey, wait!

648
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:05,730
Kotetsu-san!

649
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,445
Orin-san!

650
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:14,239
Orin-san!

651
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,000
She... She's dead!

652
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,252
Orin-san!

653
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:35,510
What a cruel thing to do...

654
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:43,226
They must have hurt...
hurt you badly, right?

655
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:49,107
You've had nothing but pain
and trouble.

656
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:54,154
Rain every day and
no sunshine for you.

657
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,368
Kotetsu, you fool!

658
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,747
Such a fool...

659
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,874
Such a fool...

660
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:20,513
Orin...

661
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,059
Orin!

662
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:28,563
Why...

663
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:31,524
Why?

664
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:34,944
Why?!

665
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:42,035
You've saved my life
once again...

666
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:48,458
Yet it all had to end
in such a horrible way...

667
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,840
What am I supposed to do now?

668
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:01,930
Tell me, Orin...

669
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,641
Orin.

670
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,277
Orin.

671
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:04,784
You wait here for
a little while, okay?

672
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:08,246
Kotetsu-san!

673
00:54:09,122 --> 00:54:12,167
Father! Mother!
Kotetsu-san's gone!

674
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:20,133
I am Senkichi Kotetsu,
from Nijo Daimonji-cho.

675
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:24,053
Those four cowards who've
just stormed my house...

676
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:25,805
Bring them here to me!

677
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:30,185
Wait!

678
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:51,331
So you're Kotetsu.
I am Shinzo Nabari-ya.

679
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:54,584
- What do you want?
- Didn't you just hear?

680
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,920
" Stop!

681
00:54:57,086 --> 00:55:00,548
The four who've just come back
from my house!

682
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:04,344
Three of them have.
They brought back your finger.

683
00:55:04,594 --> 00:55:07,972
The other one,
a traveller who settled in today,

684
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:12,685
and who was after you in revenge for
his brother Jagara, is missing.

685
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:16,481
- Now leave.
- Bring me the three who've returned.

686
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:18,358
I'll slash them to death!

687
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:21,986
Earlier, I held back,
so they wouldn't die.

688
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,824
But things have changed.
Now I have to kill them.

689
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:26,866
Changed?

690
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:30,370
Those bastards killed my wife!

691
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,455
What?

692
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:37,085
They killed my wife!
I will avenge her death!

693
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:38,586
Bring them in!

694
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:43,216
Nabari-ya.

695
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:47,387
There's been a mistake
on your side for...

696
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:52,100
having killed this man's wife.
A bad judgment.

697
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:56,521
Now, I must excuse myself.

698
00:55:58,147 --> 00:55:59,858
Good day, Nabari-ya.

699
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,652
About our earlier negotiations...

700
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:06,531
- Will you leave the matter to us?
- Yes. I will.

701
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:10,618
And what about <i>my</i> matter?
What answer have you got?

702
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:13,663
You are Senkichi Kotetsu.
Listen...

703
00:56:13,788 --> 00:56:16,749
I've got no ears to listen with!
Those three...

704
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,793
You've got to listen anyway.

705
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:22,422
I am Tatsugoro Shinmon,
from Edo.

706
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:28,636
I've been accompanying
these Hitotsubashi-sama here.

707
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:32,140
I am Kojiro Koganei,
from Bushu (Musashino),

708
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:34,684
on my visit to Kyoto and Osaka.

709
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:37,520
I am Umekichi Yakushi,
from Yamato (Nara).

710
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:41,024
I was showing the region
to Kojiro and,

711
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:43,818
as I was paying a visit
to Tatsugoro's,

712
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:47,572
we ran into the Ogaki-ya,
who asked us to...

713
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,074
get together here,
although we wanted...

714
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:53,328
to carry things out in
a discrete manner.

715
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:56,331
And I believe you should know why.

716
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:59,792
We will take your
matter in hand, too.

717
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,210
No way!

718
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:04,339
You'll just have to let us.

719
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:41,376
Well then, will you bring...

720
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,253
my Orin back to life?

721
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:54,973
Bring Orin back to life,
will you?

722
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:59,978
Why don't you understand that
it's all your fault?

723
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:01,646
What?

724
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,152
Kotetsu...

725
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,905
You were always...

726
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:15,118
against things that you
truly despised,

727
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:17,870
or people you couldn't forgive,

728
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,665
and turned into an
angry ball of flame,

729
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,292
swinging around your
Kotetsu sword.

730
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,046
It was invigorating
listening to your stories.

731
00:58:27,422 --> 00:58:29,007
They were beautiful.

732
00:58:29,924 --> 00:58:32,635
But what about this
riverbank gambling den?

733
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:36,014
What did you find to be intolerable?

734
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:38,433
Were you angry with something?

735
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,186
It was just a whim.

736
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:45,815
Out of greed.
Out of ambition.

737
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:50,695
You almost turned into the kind
of man you despise so much.

738
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,947
But you never realized.

739
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,829
Orin-san died
and proved you wrong.

740
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,081
Didn't she?

741
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:40,078
It's the first time
that I've see a man...

742
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:42,497
crying in public without reservation.

743
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,625
Ogaki-ya-san,

744
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:49,378
this is one hell of a kobun
you've got.

745
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:51,964
<i>I'm no kobun!</i>

746
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:53,758
You might want to deny it,

747
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:56,094
but you already are,
in the eyes of the public.

748
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:58,387
It's not difficult to understand!

749
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:05,770
Come on.

750
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,150
Let's go. We'll mourn quietly
for Orin-san tonight,

751
01:00:12,235 --> 01:00:14,112
and hold a respectable funeral.

752
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:16,989
After that,

753
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:21,619
you'll take over from Oburoshiki,
who's now working in Kishu,

754
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:24,872
as a construction chief.
Work hard.

755
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,541
Shed your sweat.

756
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:31,796
You'll stand on top of the scaffold
at the Aizu construction site,

757
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:35,424
give the workers a pep talk,
and let your voice...

758
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:38,302
be heard by Orin-san up there.

759
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:44,809
But... I'm...
afraid of heights!

760
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:48,396
If I have to work in construction,

761
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:51,691
I really can't be a kobun...

762
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:52,817
Idiot!

763
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:06,080

How old is she now?

788
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:08,452
Sightseeing in Kyoto?

789

Going down to Osaka?

790
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,728
Thank you.

Did you see his sword?

803
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,539
That's a Kotetsu.

804
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:37,041
Huh?

805
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,626
Push it!

806
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:45,049
The same as yours, Kondo-san.
Which one's more expensive?

807
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:47,885
- Oh, mine's longer, so...
- Longer?

808
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:50,805
Hey, are you finished with those?

809
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:54,934
Don't take them back to Mibu.
Post them around here.

810
01:04:54,934 --> 01:04:56,143
Oh, these?

811
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:59,688
COMPETENT SWORDMAN WANTED
- SHINSENGUMI

812
01:05:00,022 --> 01:05:03,025
It's your fault, Kondo-san,
that we have this many left.

813
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,194
Yesterday, and the day before,

814
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,780
in Osaka, you repeatedly said no,

815
01:05:07,822 --> 01:05:09,907
each time I tried to post one.

816
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:14,078
Of course I did:
I care where they get posted.

817
01:05:14,286 --> 01:05:18,165
It doesn't make any sense
if we don't catch the eyes...

818
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:21,836
of confident, ambitious men
in these turbulent times.

819
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:24,088
Hey, look, how about over there?

820
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:33,973
Nah, I think that house belongs
to the Satsuma Domain.

821
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,600
Then, that's the enemy's den.

822
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,978
Okay. One on the inn next door.

823
01:05:39,353 --> 01:05:41,605
And another one over there.

824
01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:43,858
That'll be enough.
All right?

825
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:45,109
Hey, wait!

826
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,241
<i>You may have come twice</i>

827
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:53,993
<i>out of politeness,</i>

828
01:05:54,368 --> 01:05:56,745
<i>but your third time</i>

829
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:59,748
<i>shows you're in love</i>

830
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:05,838
<i>The waterwheel on
Yodo river turns...</i>

831
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:07,882
Orin...

832
01:06:08,507 --> 01:06:12,136
You know where this boat's
heading to?

833
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:14,388
To Osaka.

834
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:18,476
Tomorrow, when we arrive,
we'll go straight to Shimanouchi.

835
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:21,604
This mortuary tablet of yours:

836
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:24,648
I'll apologize to my grandparents and...

837
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:28,152
add it to our family altar.

838
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:32,531
Sir! It's Senkichi-san!

839
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,783
I'm so glad for you, Orin.

840
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,245
Senkichi...

841
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:42,291
Oyoshi! Senkichi's back.

842
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:45,544
Ma'am! It's Senkichi-san!
Excuse me.

843
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,881
<i>Grandpa and Grandma,</i>

844
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:52,801
<i>without saying anything,
placed your tablet...</i>

845
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:57,056
<i>on the altar,
right beside my mother's tablet.</i>

846
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:03,812
<i>However...</i>

847
01:07:04,188 --> 01:07:06,524
<i>what followed left me bewildered...</i>

848
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:18,410
- Senkichi, meet your bride,
Otomi. - Huh?!

849
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,920
Don't you remember her?
That's Tomi-chan.

850
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:31,340
She's the daughter of
my sister's child.

851
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:34,176
She's grown into a fine lady.

852
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,847
We wanted her to be your
bride upon your return,

853
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:41,225
and adopted her in your absence.

854
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:44,603
Hey, come on, Otomi.

855
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:46,814
Come sit closer to Senkichi.

856
01:07:47,982 --> 01:07:50,317
Yes, sit closer,
right next to him.

857
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:52,194
Closer, come on.

858
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:54,863
Come on.

859
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:57,241
Please! Someone?

860
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,326
Bring me the calendar.

861
01:08:00,578 --> 01:08:02,871
Darling, we should...

862
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:05,332
quickly fix a date for...

863
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:07,501
One moment please! I...

864
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,754
Um... I am still engaged in a...

865
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,882
- large project in Kyoto...
- Orin...

866
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:15,759
I'm glad I came to Osaka.

867
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,886
<i>Now it's clear to me.</i>

868
01:08:18,012 --> 01:08:22,182
<i>“I will bet on nobody else but
the Ogaki-ya boss from now on.</i>

869
01:08:22,474 --> 01:08:26,228
<i>“Let Tomi-chan take a husband
and make them your heirs,“</i>

870
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:27,605
<i>I said to them.</i>

871
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,356
<i>Grandpa turned purple.</i>

872
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,358
<i>Grandma stamped on the tatami.</i>

873
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,361
<i>And Tomi-Chan was...</i>

874
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:36,989
<i>Anyway, I'm on my way back to Kyoto.</i>

875
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:41,076
<i>Before leaving,
I had to meet my friends.</i>

876
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:44,121
<i>The best and baddest
of all my friends:</i>

877
01:08:44,622 --> 01:08:46,498
<i>Mizuoto and his wife Otsune.</i>

878
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,877
<i>My second-best friend Heiko,
and his wife Icchan.</i>

879
01:08:50,002 --> 01:08:53,631
<i>Susumu Yamazaki:
son of an acupuncture doctor.</i>

880
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:56,759
<i>We used to study swordplay together.</i>

881
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,511
<i>He thinks he's as good
as me. Ha!</i>

882
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:00,763
<i>Nonsense...</i>

883
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:04,141
<i>I'd beat him three times in
a row in a three-game match.</i>

884
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:05,893
<i>Um... Who's he?</i>

885
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:08,520
<i>Must be Yamazaki's junior.</i>

886
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:12,733
<i>Yamazaki says he brought him,
but isn't he a samurai...?</i>

887
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,907
Are you out of your mind?

888
01:09:20,032 --> 01:09:22,242
The Shinsengumi are never
gonna make it.

889
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:25,663
As long as it's profitable...

890
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:27,915
You couldn't be worse!

891
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:30,292
That's a terrible thing to say!

892
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:51,563
Orin...

893
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:00,197
The teapot's empty.

894
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:21,176
- Goodbye!
- Say thanks to your parents!

895
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:22,678
It's here.

896
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:24,179
GODS!

897
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:26,682
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry!

898
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,818
Kotetsu! Here I am!

899
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:39,319
Oh, there you are.

900
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,614
Sasaki and I made up our minds.

901
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,200
We've come for a try-out
with the Shinsengumi.

902
01:10:45,617 --> 01:10:47,619
We're staying here for the night.

903
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:48,871
- Staying?
- Yeah.

904
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:52,583
- Now the two of us are going
to Mibu. - Two?

905
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:55,753
Why two? There are three
of you, aren't there?

906
01:10:55,878 --> 01:10:58,881
Huh? Oh...

907
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:02,634
Mizuoto asked me to
bring that kid to you.

908
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:05,387
He's Heikichi Kobayashi.

909
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,765
He's been repudiated by his father.

910
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:11,518
Mizuoto said you can use him
as an apprentice.

911
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,020
What?

912
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:17,024
He doesn't even bother to ask
and still gets his own way!

913
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:20,027
Oh, Well.

914
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,863
All right. But this afternoon,

915
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:27,534
we'll all be out for work at the
Aizu construction site in Kamanza.

916
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:29,369
Aguri-chan!

917
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:32,539
Three more tables for dinner, please.

918
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:34,750
Aguri-chan?

919
01:11:35,918 --> 01:11:37,002
Aguri-chan!

920
01:11:39,922 --> 01:11:41,173
What's with you?

921
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:43,675
Love at first sight?

922
01:11:48,263 --> 01:11:49,765
None of your business!

923
01:12:01,527 --> 01:12:07,699
END OF PART ONE

924
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:09,409
PART TWO

925
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,703
PART TWO

926
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:14,414
If I can't be with you,
I'll die.

927
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:19,711
I'd even run away with you.

928
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:23,423
I...

929
01:12:29,596 --> 01:12:30,722
Aguri-chan...

930
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,624
Kiss me on the lips.

931
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:02,129
Kiss?

932
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:08,510
That's what you do when
in love, so they say.

933
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:23,901
It's hot.

934
01:13:24,026 --> 01:13:28,530
Hey. The last moving cart
will arrive. Oyabun, too.

935
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:30,908
Don't let him see you like that.

936
01:13:33,911 --> 01:13:37,164
But why on earth does Kotetsu...

937
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:48,884
You know, Kotetsu always makes
objections against...

938
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:51,178
Sasaki and Aguri-chan
being together.

939
01:13:51,303 --> 01:13:53,305
Why is he so cynical?

940
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:56,892
Well, he's always been a weirdo,
but...

941
01:13:57,392 --> 01:14:01,939
in order to let them get married,
we'll have to convince him.

942
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:03,565
Absolutely.

943
01:14:04,316 --> 01:14:06,526
Aguri-chan is an only daughter.

944
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:10,322
Sasaki-san's quitting the samurai
and the Shinsengumi to marry...

945
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:15,077
into Yaofuji; the greengrocery
won't be easy.

946
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:17,829
So, the only person who...

947
01:14:17,955 --> 01:14:21,541
might be able to settle this problem
is our Oyabun,

948
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:24,336
by convincing Aguri-chan's parents.

949
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:28,548
Today, I'm gonna make Oyabun
say "Yes".

950
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:31,093
You can count on me.

951
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:35,097
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

952
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:43,438
Sorry. Excuse me.

953
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,570
FOR RENT

954
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:57,244
"We've moved to Sannomiya-cho,
south of Shomen

955
01:14:57,577 --> 01:15:00,122
"- Senkichi & Kotetsu of Aizu."

956
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,272
Watch where you're going!

957
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:40,746
Aguri-chan, thank you.
Go home now.

958
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:44,499
It's the busiest time
at your father's greengrocery.

959
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,667
Go help him.

960
01:15:50,005 --> 01:15:53,425
Sasaki-san.
You'd better go, too.

961
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,511
Haven't you got work to
do for the Shinsengumi?

962
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,932
Oh, no. My patrol shift was yesterday.
I'm off today.

963
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,810
We're not through with these.

964
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:05,437
No! Don't!

965
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:06,938
Aguri-chan!

966
01:16:08,148 --> 01:16:09,441
Here, Aguri-chan.

967
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:10,650
Aguri-chan.

968
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:12,402
Let go of it.

969
01:16:13,028 --> 01:16:14,154
Let go!

970
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:15,781
Aguri-chan.

971
01:16:16,907 --> 01:16:18,575
Let me take them, Oyabun.

972
01:16:20,452 --> 01:16:21,536
Get off!

973
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,956
Leave the young couple alone,
won't you?

974
01:16:25,082 --> 01:16:27,459
Yamazaki!
Let me tell you something:

975
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:30,212
You say you've spent all
your savings.

976
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:32,672
Haven't you found a job
to do yet?

977
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:36,843
And yet you fool around,
while we're all busy moving.

978
01:16:37,344 --> 01:16:39,679
Are you done with your eating?

979
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:43,100
All right, then. Listen:

980
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:45,435
I've been gathering information...

981
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,105
from your conversations
with your kobuns.

982
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:50,232
What information, stupid?!

983
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:51,483
How can you...

984
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,611
- Oh, I'll carry it for you.
- Leave it!

985
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:56,798
The clay bell's missing!

986
01:17:58,258 --> 01:17:59,259
Someone...?

987
01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:02,053
The bell I've kept in here.

988
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,556
Orin's bell!

989
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,016
Hey!

990
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,436
lroha?

991
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,062
Ueba?

992
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:17,027
Hey!

993
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:40,342
It's gonna fall!
Fall down and smash!

994
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,343
Someone!

995
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,315
But Why?

996
01:18:56,066 --> 01:19:01,613
How did it climb up here from
the drawer of Orin's dresser?

997
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:04,366
Someone!

998
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:06,368
I mean... who did it?

999
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:13,750
You all know that
I'm afraid of heights!

1000
01:19:19,506 --> 01:19:20,632
You bastards!

1001
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:23,343
You're all going to get it!

1002
01:19:50,412 --> 01:19:53,873
What... What are you doing?

1003
01:20:01,548 --> 01:20:03,133
- Pull it!
- Yes!

1004
01:20:03,258 --> 01:20:05,302
- No!
- Hey!

1005
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:07,554
- You do it, quickly!
- Yes!

1006
01:20:16,688 --> 01:20:17,897
The ladder!

1007
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:20,692
I'm slipping--

1008
01:20:21,568 --> 01:20:25,572
- Oyabun! Please!
- What?

1009
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:29,576
We have a favour to ask concerning
these two. They're in love.

1010
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:30,785
What?

1011
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:34,456
Won't you please approve their
marriage, Oyabun?

1012
01:20:34,581 --> 01:20:40,086
And please talk to Aguri-chan's parents
and convince them to give consent.

1013
01:20:40,337 --> 01:20:42,714
We beg of you.
Hey, you, too.

1014
01:20:42,714 --> 01:20:45,175
- Please! - Please!
- No, I can't!

1015
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:49,721
I'm gonna fall down...
The ladder!

1016
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:52,432
We won't prop it up
unless you say "Yes

1017
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:54,726
You set me up!

1018
01:20:56,978 --> 01:21:00,482
- No...
- Kotetsu-san!

1019
01:21:00,565 --> 01:21:05,445
I can't live if I can't marry him!

1020
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:06,863
Aguri-chan.

1021
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:09,949
It's only for your own sake.

1022
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,578
Because you made nice with Orin,

1023
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:19,250
I don't want you to suffer
like my late mother did...

1024
01:21:19,376 --> 01:21:22,587
Not with a samurai!
Sasaki-san...

1025
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:25,632
Didn't you bet your life
on the Shinsengumi?

1026
01:21:26,132 --> 01:21:28,259
Then how can you make
a woman happy?

1027
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:32,138
I promise I will make
Aguri-chan happy!

1028
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:35,767
You don't understand a thing
about a woman's feelings!

1029
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:39,646
Kotetsu.

1030
01:21:39,854 --> 01:21:42,148
Why don't you just give up?

1031
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:54,035
The... la... cider...

1032
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,286
Hurray!

1033
01:21:57,038 --> 01:22:00,375
Didn't you hear me?
Gimme the ladder!

1034
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:03,670
<i>...burned down in a fire</i>

1035
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:07,006
<i>Sanjusangen-do Temple</i>

1036
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:09,008
<i>survived this fire</i>

1037
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:16,641
<i>Who stands right behind
you now?</i>

1038
01:22:20,145 --> 01:22:21,312
Wait a second.

1039
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:33,324
Over there.

1040
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:36,953
- Hey, Sasaki!
- Kuma!

1041
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:38,663
Come here for a second.

1042
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:41,583
- Let's...
- Yes.

1043
01:22:43,585 --> 01:22:45,336
Here we go... hup!

1044
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:48,548
Look, look...
Isn't that it?

1045
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:55,096
Oh, thank you very much.

1046
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:57,223
We appreciate your assistance.

1047
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,103
Hey!

1048
01:23:02,729 --> 01:23:04,564
<i>You! From the Shinsengumi!</i>

1049
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:08,485
Banzai to you!

1050
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:10,737
Sasaki-san!

1051
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:12,947
Yes?

1052
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:19,078
Just one thing.

1053
01:23:21,247 --> 01:23:22,248
Remember...

1054
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:30,381
I really hate those who hurt...
or cheat...

1055
01:23:32,133 --> 01:23:35,637
women. All right?

1056
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:40,892
Anyway, her parents say...

1057
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:46,022
they want to meet Sasaki-san,
and are waiting for you.

1058
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:53,780
- L...
- Go. Hurry.

1059
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:56,157
Yes!

1060
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:20,890
A leather cigarette case
from Grandpa.

1061
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:23,059
But I chose it for you.

1062
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:27,188
Sweet bean jelly from Toraya,

1063
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:31,943
and rice puff crackers
from Grandma.

1064
01:24:35,697 --> 01:24:37,156
The head clerk said,

1065
01:24:37,323 --> 01:24:39,951
after he'd made sure
I entered this house,

1066
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,787
he would visit customers...

1067
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:46,666
in Gionmachi or Muromachi,
then go back to Osaka.

1068
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:50,211
Go back to Osaka.
I beg you.

1069
01:24:50,211 --> 01:24:52,839
Oh no, I'm not saying you
must leave right now...

1070
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:55,216
I'll find lodgings for you.

1071
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:57,093
Enjoy Kyoto, and...

1072
01:24:57,218 --> 01:25:00,471
Grandpa and Grandma
asked me to come here.

1073
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:03,933
- Tomi-chan.
- And get Senkichi-san back.

1074
01:25:03,975 --> 01:25:05,226
Tomi-chan.

1075
01:25:14,736 --> 01:25:15,987
Out of our way!

1076
01:25:22,869 --> 01:25:23,870
Commander.

1077
01:25:27,707 --> 01:25:29,334
- Chief!
- Eh?

1078
01:25:32,086 --> 01:25:33,504
It's you, Sasaki.

1079
01:25:34,255 --> 01:25:35,882
Who's this woman?

1080
01:25:37,342 --> 01:25:40,637
Her name is Aguri. She's my...

1081
01:25:43,014 --> 01:25:44,223
You're Aguri?

1082
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:50,521
Isn't she pretty?

1083
01:25:54,984 --> 01:25:56,027
Tomi-chan.

1084
01:25:56,903 --> 01:25:59,781
There's an Oyabun called
Seihachi, of the Ogaki-ya.

1085
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:01,741
I bet my life on him.

1086
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:05,411
I don't expect you to understand.

1087
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,372
Call me stupid.

1088
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,625
Forgive me.

1089
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,920
Working for this Oyabun
is my only...

1090
01:26:14,045 --> 01:26:15,505
ll f?

1091
01:26:16,297 --> 01:26:18,049
- Even gambling?
- It's still work!

1092
01:26:26,057 --> 01:26:29,060
I work under Seihachi,
of the Ogaki-ya.

1093
01:26:29,268 --> 01:26:31,187
My name is Kotetsu, of Aizu.

1094
01:26:31,312 --> 01:26:35,441
- What do you want?
- I'm not addressing you.

1095
01:26:35,525 --> 01:26:37,568
Pardon my sudden intervention,

1096
01:26:37,694 --> 01:26:40,196
but this Tome the Helper
is a peddler.

1097
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:43,199
Seihachi Ogaki-ya is,
as you know,

1098
01:26:43,324 --> 01:26:45,576
a gambler and an employment agent.

1099
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,080
This place is Ogaki-ya territory.

1100
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:53,209
We can't allow these peddlers
to hold any games here,

1101
01:26:53,334 --> 01:26:55,545
and bring shame on the Ogaki-ya.

1102
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:57,046
Shut up!

1103
01:26:57,797 --> 01:26:59,215
Bullshit!

1104
01:26:59,424 --> 01:27:00,675
Wanna fight?

1105
01:27:01,092 --> 01:27:04,595
Again, as you know,
the Ogaki-ya is now...

1106
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:09,934
about to complete an assignment
commissioned by the Lord of Aizu.

1107
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:14,939
We were instructed not to look
for trouble with cheap peddlers,

1108
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:19,193
but to have our name disgraced
is simply intolerable.

1109
01:27:19,986 --> 01:27:23,322
Sincere apologies
for this incivility...

1110
01:27:31,956 --> 01:27:33,624
I'll chop off his head!

1111
01:27:35,835 --> 01:27:37,336
Everyone...

1112
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:42,008
Would you please call this game off?

1113
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,470
You're gonna pay for this!

1114
01:27:52,894 --> 01:27:55,521
- Kill them!
- Wait!

1115
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:05,406
My name is Otatsu,
from Hyogo. I said, wait!

1116
01:28:05,782 --> 01:28:08,659
Brother. You, too: wait.

1117
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:25,760
What's this?

1118
01:28:26,636 --> 01:28:29,806
- A monogram.
- A monogram?

1119
01:28:30,181 --> 01:28:34,185
Oyabun, we already have one,
the Dai from the Ogaki-ya.

1120
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:40,024
I was thinking about creating
another version of it...

1121
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,049
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1122
01:29:05,842 --> 01:29:07,844
Damn it...

1123
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:09,470
That's it!

1124
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,224
Idiot.

1125
01:29:13,224 --> 01:29:15,434
- It's all wrinkled...
- But cool!

1126
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:18,354
The Ogaki-ya boss loves <i>sake,</i>

1127
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:21,232
and always asks Ane-san to
fill up his gourd.

1128
01:29:21,858 --> 01:29:25,987
He'd go to a place with
a nice view and sip from it,

1129
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:29,365
saying that this gourd is
his only luxury,

1130
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,450
then get drunk, right?

1131
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:34,120
It'll suit you too, Oyabun!

1132
01:29:34,495 --> 01:29:37,623
- Cut the crap, kid.
- Oh no, wait.

1133
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:41,377
Now that you mention it,
you may be right.

1134
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:46,507
I should ask the boss
to have a look at this.

1135
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:55,141
I'm sorry, Tomi-chan.

1136
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,895
I've always been busy
and left you alone.

1137
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:02,106
But I'm glad that a nice lady is...

1138
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:04,233
accompanying you to Osaka.

1139
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:07,486
I leave her in your hands,
Oyabun-san.

1140
01:30:08,905 --> 01:30:11,365
Coming from you,
I have to say yes.

1141
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:13,159
It's been 10 days...

1142
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:16,287
since we participated in
that game, but Seihachi-san...

1143
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,414
and Oei-san of the Ogaki-ya...

1144
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:20,791
have been hospitably kind to us,

1145
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:24,420
so I feel obliged to respond
in kind to them.

1146
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:26,797
I'll accompany her to Shimanouchi.

1147
01:30:26,923 --> 01:30:31,677
Oh no, you can drop her at Hakken-ya.
I've arranged for her pick-up.

1148
01:30:31,928 --> 01:30:32,929
Kotetsu-san...

1149
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:35,514
don't you ever feel lonely?

1150
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:39,435
Does it seem strange,
hearing that from me?

1151
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:42,396
- No.
- Really?

1152
01:30:45,566 --> 01:30:48,819
On the 18th, when you were
out transporting lumber...

1153
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,571
Have you heard?

1154
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:53,658
One hell of a commotion
at the Imperial Palace.

1155
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:57,328
The Sonno-joi allies
Satsuma and Choshu split up.

1156
01:30:57,703 --> 01:31:01,207
Satsuma won and chased Choshu
away from Kyoto.

1157
01:31:01,457 --> 01:31:03,834
Shortly before that,
on the 13th,

1158
01:31:05,419 --> 01:31:09,090
Serizawa from the Shinsengumi
set fire to Yamato-ya at Ichijo,

1159
01:31:09,215 --> 01:31:11,842
on account of them failing
to pay him off.

1160
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:16,555
Samurai are all the same:
they seek nothing but trouble.

1161
01:31:16,973 --> 01:31:19,558
Leave them be
and they'll devastate Kyoto.

1162
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:24,105
You know, these men left their
wives and children behind.

1163
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:27,358
How about bringing
the whole family here?

1164
01:31:27,942 --> 01:31:30,695
Don't you agree?
Not a bad idea?

1165
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:32,446
Urn... well...

1166
01:31:32,613 --> 01:31:35,825
But those fellows are all
in a prickly mood,

1167
01:31:35,866 --> 01:31:39,620
out on the prowl for women
in Kyoto, like dogs in heat.

1168
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:45,876
Scratch a samurai, and you'll find
a man of flesh and blood.

1169
01:31:53,259 --> 01:31:55,386
I'm a woman of flesh and blood.

1170
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:59,515
And you know what?
I fell for you.

1171
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:02,476
If I were a bit younger...

1172
01:32:03,644 --> 01:32:07,398
He's also a man of flesh and blood.
You get it?

1173
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:11,736
Yes.

1174
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:16,157
<i>The boat's leaving soon!</i>

1175
01:32:18,743 --> 01:32:20,536
<i>Hop on the boat, quick!</i>

1176
01:32:21,412 --> 01:32:26,417
<i>This is the boat for Hakken-ya,
Osaka.</i>

1177
01:32:29,545 --> 01:32:30,671
Senkichi-san...

1178
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:34,425
You said you hated anyone
who is cruel to women.

1179
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:38,929
Yet you're now being cruel to me.

1180
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:41,432
Tomi-chan!

1181
01:32:50,316 --> 01:32:53,944
<i>The boat's leaving now!</i>

1182
01:32:56,947 --> 01:32:58,949
AIZU
HEADQUARTERS

1183
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,951
Thank you for coming,

1184
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:04,205
and for your hard work
on the construction.

1185
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:08,834
Now, you're sitting too
far away to talk with. Please.

1186
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:12,213
Consider this as a private meeting.

1187
01:33:13,339 --> 01:33:14,965
Everyone, come inside.

1188
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:30,106
You know them?

1189
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:34,110
They are Commander Kondo and
members of the Shinsengumi.

1190
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:44,870
This is my first time meeting you.

1191
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:50,126
Vice Commander,
Keisuke Yamanami.

1192
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:53,087
Vice Commander, Hijikata.

1193
01:33:53,254 --> 01:33:55,881
- Urn... I'm Okita.
- Oh!

1194
01:33:57,633 --> 01:33:59,135
Shinpachi Nagakura.

1195
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:01,011
Genzaburo Inoue.

1196
01:34:01,762 --> 01:34:03,139
Heisuke Todo.

1197
01:34:03,514 --> 01:34:05,015
Sanosuke Harada.

1198
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:08,394
Then, let me introduce them.

1199
01:34:10,896 --> 01:34:13,482
Ogaki-ya Oyabun Seihachi.

1200
01:34:13,983 --> 01:34:17,027
His first kobun,
chief clerk Kuniemon.

1201
01:34:17,278 --> 01:34:20,281
Second kobun,
chief carpenter Kokichi.

1202
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:26,996
Head of the newly-established
Aizu crew, Kotetsu of Aizu.

1203
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:29,248
Now, we're all set.

1204
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:34,503
We didn't ask the Serizawa
faction to come here today.

1205
01:34:35,546 --> 01:34:39,925
Such are the intentions of the Lord of
Aizu, Military Commissioner of Kyoto.

1206
01:34:40,134 --> 01:34:42,303
- Please look at it that way.
- Yes.

1207
01:34:42,553 --> 01:34:46,557
What the Shinsengumi
needs most today is friends.

1208
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,768
To this day, there are...

1209
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:54,064
those of us who would rather
make enemies of people in Kyoto.

1210
01:34:55,566 --> 01:34:58,944
- We'll dispense with all that.
- Now Choshu is...

1211
01:34:59,153 --> 01:35:02,406
willing to mobilize an army
for their return to Kyoto.

1212
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:05,201
Their radicals, along with...

1213
01:35:05,326 --> 01:35:08,287
like-minded expatriates
who've joined them,

1214
01:35:08,412 --> 01:35:11,165
and Ronins, have changed
their names and emblems...

1215
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,667
and gathered in Kyoto already.

1216
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:19,965
Satsuma is against Choshu,
but you never know what they're up to.

1217
01:35:20,591 --> 01:35:22,301
The same goes for Tosa.

1218
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:28,599
So, as a measure of extra
precaution, we...

1219
01:35:28,724 --> 01:35:32,728
Are you asking us to work for
the Shinsengumi as spies?

1220
01:35:32,853 --> 01:35:34,104
Not at all.

1221
01:35:34,355 --> 01:35:37,483
We have members in charge of that.

1222
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:41,987
Look, we want you to be our friends.

1223
01:35:43,239 --> 01:35:46,367
- That's all we ask.
- We want friends.

1224
01:35:46,617 --> 01:35:47,952
Simple as that.

1225
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:50,829
But it's the most crucial
thing for us.

1226
01:35:50,955 --> 01:35:54,250
And in fact, this is also the
intention of...

1227
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:57,378
the Lord of Aizu, Military
Commissioner of Kyoto.

1228
01:35:58,462 --> 01:35:59,880
What do you think?

1229
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:03,759
If that's what our Oyabun wants.

1230
01:36:04,093 --> 01:36:05,511
We won't say no.

1231
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:12,142
You've just heard our answer.

1232
01:36:17,648 --> 01:36:20,651
- Got something to say?
- Yes.

1233
01:36:22,152 --> 01:36:25,281
I wish to talk with Kondo-san
in person.

1234
01:36:55,561 --> 01:36:58,272
I guess we've been destined
to meet again.

1235
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:01,066
I noticed your sword,
back in the spring,

1236
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:03,694
at Kyobashi, in Fushimi.

1237
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:05,696
So you remembered.

1238
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:09,074
Now that the ice is broken,
please...

1239
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:10,826
I'm ready to listen.

1240
01:37:12,578 --> 01:37:17,708
Would you please allow Aijiro Sasaki
to leave the Shinsengumi?

1241
01:37:19,084 --> 01:37:20,544
I must beg this of you.

1242
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:25,341
- Of his own will?
- For the sake of a woman.

1243
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:27,926
- Kotetsu-kun.
- Kondo-san.

1244
01:37:28,844 --> 01:37:33,307
Sasaki-san is planning to
marry a girl called Aguri.

1245
01:37:34,058 --> 01:37:37,603
She is the only daughter
of a humble greengrocer.

1246
01:37:38,228 --> 01:37:42,441
She's been living with
her father and mother.

1247
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,987
He should be congratulated.

1248
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:51,825
Sasaki has, in this time of turmoil,
set out on an adventure...

1249
01:37:52,242 --> 01:37:55,245
and joined the Shinsengumi,
ambitious and proud.

1250
01:37:55,371 --> 01:37:57,122
Moreover, he won her heart.

1251
01:37:57,247 --> 01:38:00,751
While in the Shinsengumi,
he can't make her happy.

1252
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:03,962
Besides, that ambitious and proud...

1253
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,757
samurai and a town girl
will never...

1254
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:09,259
- Ah, wait a second...
- Kondo-san.

1255
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:11,261
Kotetsu-kun...

1256
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:15,641
The Shinsengumi is made up of
human beings.

1257
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:18,727
I mean, we're men.

1258
01:38:19,645 --> 01:38:23,774
Men need women.
It's only natural, isn't it?

1259
01:38:24,483 --> 01:38:27,027
- Do you mean to defy nature?
- Women...

1260
01:38:27,403 --> 01:38:29,530
bet their lives on that nature.

1261
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:31,657
Can a man...

1262
01:38:32,157 --> 01:38:35,619
especially a member of the
Shinsengumi, do the same?

1263
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:39,790
- They can't.
- That's what men are all about.

1264
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:42,668
Then what about women?

1265
01:38:45,254 --> 01:38:48,173
Listen, Kondo-san.
This girl Aguri...

1266
01:38:49,007 --> 01:38:54,179
I can never permit her to be a
woman who would weep...

1267
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:57,015
for all the misfortunes
of the world.

1268
01:39:02,688 --> 01:39:05,149
I will swear it on
my Kotetsu sword.

1269
01:39:06,066 --> 01:39:10,320
I, Kondo, will never make that
girl, Aguri, a sad woman!

1270
01:39:12,281 --> 01:39:13,323
Kotetsu-kun...

1271
01:39:14,450 --> 01:39:18,454
Right now, every single member is
important for the Shinsengumi.

1272
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:22,833
We can't afford to lose any of them.
We just can't.

1273
01:39:37,347 --> 01:39:38,557
Orin.

1274
01:39:49,067 --> 01:39:50,068
All right.

1275
01:39:50,986 --> 01:39:52,571
Good.

1276
01:39:57,117 --> 01:39:59,203
Let me invite you today.

1277
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:02,122
Well, I'm just a rustic type of man...

1278
01:40:02,873 --> 01:40:04,333
but, just now,

1279
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,753
the proprietress found
me an unusual girl.

1280
01:40:08,003 --> 01:40:09,713
This will be my treat for you.

1281
01:40:14,885 --> 01:40:17,513
Now, Kotetsu-kun,
go over there.

1282
01:40:17,888 --> 01:40:19,473
Please, please.

1283
01:40:54,550 --> 01:41:01,306
<i><From the last paragraph
of the Noh play 'Izutsu'></i>

1284
01:41:02,558 --> 01:41:06,311
A daughter of a merchant in Osaka,
an acquaintance of the proprietress,

1285
01:41:06,395 --> 01:41:10,524
said she wanted to dance for the
customers here, for some reason.

1286
01:41:12,025 --> 01:41:13,777
Noh training, I guess.

1287
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:10,495
Sasaki...

1288
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:15,959
Your girl, whom I met at
Miyagawa-cho, Aguri...

1289
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:19,087
I'll make her my mistress.
Be prepared.

1290
01:44:19,129 --> 01:44:20,881
- Hey, Mister!
- Huh?

1291
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:23,633
But... Commander!

1292
01:44:23,842 --> 01:44:27,345
- We're planning a wedding...
- As soon as tonight!

1293
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:31,600
Aguri is my...

1294
01:44:32,893 --> 01:44:34,770
As soon as tonight.

1295
01:45:00,670 --> 01:45:02,005
Hey, Sasaki.

1296
01:45:02,756 --> 01:45:05,675
- Sorry for being late.
- Thank you for taking the trouble.

1297
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:07,677
Let me get the door for you.

1298
01:45:07,803 --> 01:45:10,180
Oh, really?
Well, I appreciate it.

1299
01:45:13,058 --> 01:45:14,059
Here you go.

1300
01:45:14,184 --> 01:45:15,936
Thanks. It's nothing, but...

1301
01:45:16,061 --> 01:45:19,189
- Oh, but you really shouldn't...
- Oh, please.

1302
01:45:19,272 --> 01:45:20,690
Thank you so much.

1303
01:45:21,066 --> 01:45:23,193
Man, you're in bad trouble.

1304
01:45:23,944 --> 01:45:28,448
Chances are, you'll be dead
and that girl will be lost.

1305
01:45:29,533 --> 01:45:32,327
If you really love that girl,

1306
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:35,288
you have no choice
other than to desert.

1307
01:45:35,455 --> 01:45:37,165
- Desert?
- Yes...

1308
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:40,710
And the time is now.
Right now.

1309
01:45:41,795 --> 01:45:43,088
What will you do?

1310
01:45:44,297 --> 01:45:47,425
Cling to the group
and hand over the girl?

1311
01:45:47,717 --> 01:45:49,469
Time to prove you're a man.

1312
01:45:49,594 --> 01:45:51,805
Leave the group and
flee with her?

1313
01:45:54,599 --> 01:45:58,353
When Commander Serizawa says
"tonight", he means it.

1314
01:46:00,939 --> 01:46:03,191
Your courage is at stake here.

1315
01:46:03,358 --> 01:46:04,609
Saeki-san.

1316
01:46:33,638 --> 01:46:35,265
Who is it, may I ask?

1317
01:46:37,767 --> 01:46:39,102
Senkichi-san...

1318
01:46:39,144 --> 01:46:42,856
Well, my husband's not back yet.

1319
01:46:44,024 --> 01:46:45,901
The others are out at work.

1320
01:46:49,654 --> 01:46:51,907
Please come back
sometime tomorrow.

1321
01:47:08,798 --> 01:47:12,260
- What's this? Can't open it!
- What are you doing?

1322
01:47:13,678 --> 01:47:16,056
Quick! Hurry, quick!

1323
01:47:25,565 --> 01:47:26,816
Here.

1324
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:29,444
Quick!

1325
01:47:48,338 --> 01:47:52,300
<i>Cooked beans, anyone?</i>

1326
01:47:55,971 --> 01:47:58,223
This house is still empty, right?

1327
01:47:58,473 --> 01:48:00,475
No one will find us.

1328
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:03,979
No...

1329
01:48:04,604 --> 01:48:08,733
We're dealing with Commander Serizawa.
There's no use hiding.

1330
01:48:11,695 --> 01:48:14,864
When did they come?
With Commander Niimi?

1331
01:48:15,115 --> 01:48:18,368
Just a while ago,
out of the blue,

1332
01:48:19,703 --> 01:48:23,206
saying they'll come tonight to
make her Serizawa's mistress.

1333
01:48:23,248 --> 01:48:26,584
- They're crazy...
- No use moaning now.

1334
01:48:26,751 --> 01:48:30,755
Go look for Kotetsu-san in Okazaki
or Kamanza and ask for his help!

1335
01:48:33,383 --> 01:48:35,260
Well... then... I'll go.

1336
01:48:36,261 --> 01:48:37,387
Don't!

1337
01:48:38,263 --> 01:48:40,390
I've got no time to waste...

1338
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:46,021
As I said,
I've no choice but to escape.

1339
01:48:46,146 --> 01:48:47,355
Sasaki-san!

1340
01:49:13,423 --> 01:49:16,885
- Hello. - Otomi-san?
- Yes!

1341
01:49:17,177 --> 01:49:20,263
Thank you for the gift,
it was a nice treat.

1342
01:49:20,388 --> 01:49:22,265
Well, I wanted to thank you.

1343
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:27,312
I've brought you some boiled sea eel
to add to your dinner menu.

1344
01:49:27,437 --> 01:49:30,315
- Wow! Looks delicious!
- Oh, it's not much...

1345
01:51:45,074 --> 01:51:46,701
What's up?

1346
01:51:48,453 --> 01:51:49,954
Something happened?

1347
01:51:52,665 --> 01:51:54,042
Open the door.

1348
01:51:54,959 --> 01:51:56,085
Huh?

1349
01:51:57,462 --> 01:51:59,672
- Escaped?
- Yes.

1350
01:52:00,715 --> 01:52:02,717
My folks live in Hirakata.

1351
01:52:04,219 --> 01:52:07,805
They'll hide out there for a while
and think about their next move.

1352
01:52:08,431 --> 01:52:10,600
I walked them to Tofukuji Temple.

1353
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:14,479
- They took Toba Street...
- Good! Very good.

1354
01:52:14,729 --> 01:52:16,689
Good job, helping them escape!

1355
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,485
Serves him right,
that bastard Serizawa!

1356
01:52:20,985 --> 01:52:22,570
Anyway, come inside.

1357
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:29,327
This is bad.

1358
01:52:29,494 --> 01:52:32,330
He's deserted, right?

1359
01:52:33,331 --> 01:52:36,709
Desertion is punishable by
seppuku if caught.

1360
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,838
If he tries to fight back,
he'll be slayed on the spot!

1361
01:52:41,506 --> 01:52:43,633
"Resignation is forbidden."

1362
01:52:44,259 --> 01:52:46,511
<i>That's the rule of the Shinsengumi!</i>

1363
01:52:46,636 --> 01:52:47,845
What the hell...

1364
01:52:48,388 --> 01:52:50,014
That's ridiculous!

1365
01:52:50,723 --> 01:52:52,225
He promised...

1366
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,394
How dare he break it!

1367
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:57,397
The Shinsengumi are a bunch of liars!

1368
01:52:58,273 --> 01:53:01,651
But Sasaki-san said
his colleague Saeki-san...

1369
01:53:01,776 --> 01:53:05,613
advised him that he had no choice
but to escape...

1370
01:53:05,655 --> 01:53:09,033
Saeki? Very, very bad...

1371
01:53:10,285 --> 01:53:14,289
Saeki is Commander Serizawa's
henchman!

1372
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:21,296
That bastard Serizawa put Saeki up to it,
in order to eliminate Sasaki!

1373
01:53:22,547 --> 01:53:24,173
They might ambush them...

1374
01:53:26,759 --> 01:53:28,553
I won't let them do that!

1375
01:53:29,304 --> 01:53:33,558
I'll run to Mibu to call on Commander Kondo,
as well as Hijikata-san.

1376
01:53:34,434 --> 01:53:37,061
- I hope I can...
- I'll make it in time!

1377
01:53:44,027 --> 01:53:47,530
No! I'm the only one who's going.

1378
01:53:47,572 --> 01:53:50,325
- Oyabun, but why?
- Shut up!

1379
01:54:01,085 --> 01:54:05,048
Stupid!
So you just let him go alone?

1380
01:54:05,089 --> 01:54:09,594
But it was Oyabun himself who said,
"You've got work to do tomorrow.

1381
01:54:10,053 --> 01:54:13,973
- "Follow me and you're fired."
- How important is work?

1382
01:54:14,182 --> 01:54:18,353
Work can be replaced,
but human life is irreplaceable!

1383
01:54:21,314 --> 01:54:24,984
Someone give me a dagger.
Give it to me.

1384
01:54:24,984 --> 01:54:26,486
No, don't!

1385
01:54:27,445 --> 01:54:29,447
If you're not going, I will.

1386
01:54:31,991 --> 01:54:33,326
Don't.

1387
01:54:33,451 --> 01:54:36,579
- What are you doing, Otomi-san?
- No, let go of me!

1388
01:54:36,746 --> 01:54:37,872
Get away!

1389
01:54:38,623 --> 01:54:39,874
Get away!

1390
01:54:51,636 --> 01:54:53,971
No time to waste! Hurry!

1391
01:54:54,263 --> 01:54:55,473
Brother!

1392
01:54:58,518 --> 01:54:59,894
What's happening?

1393
01:55:01,896 --> 01:55:04,524
Ouch! Where are you going?

1394
01:55:27,046 --> 01:55:28,548
You tricked me!

1395
01:55:29,173 --> 01:55:30,425
That's foul.

1396
01:55:32,176 --> 01:55:33,428
That's dirty!

1397
01:55:34,804 --> 01:55:36,055
Shut up.

1398
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:38,433
A rule's a rule.

1399
01:55:41,686 --> 01:55:43,813
Give me a sword!

1400
01:55:44,772 --> 01:55:47,400
I will die with you!

1401
01:55:58,578 --> 01:55:59,829
Aguri-chan!

1402
01:56:05,793 --> 01:56:07,044
You're dead!

1403
01:56:09,714 --> 01:56:10,840
Sasaki-san!

1404
01:56:22,226 --> 01:56:23,478
Saeki!

1405
01:56:29,734 --> 01:56:31,944
- Damn!
- Idiot!

1406
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:34,614
Who told you to kill the girl?

1407
01:56:35,490 --> 01:56:38,618
Niimi! How could you...

1408
01:56:39,327 --> 01:56:40,369
Commander.

1409
01:56:42,371 --> 01:56:45,082
Commander!

1410
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:47,335
Commander!

1411
01:56:48,002 --> 01:56:49,629
Let go of me!

1412
01:56:51,881 --> 01:56:53,716
Let's go down to Sumizome!

1413
01:56:59,847 --> 01:57:00,765
Niimi-san.

1414
01:57:26,415 --> 01:57:27,875
Aguri-chan...

1415
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:41,365
Aguri-chan.

1416
01:58:44,076 --> 01:58:45,202
Sasaki-san.

1417
01:58:52,001 --> 01:58:54,211
Damn!

1418
01:59:01,761 --> 01:59:03,012
Kotetsu...

1419
01:59:03,137 --> 01:59:04,889
Are you chagrined?

1420
01:59:05,222 --> 01:59:07,224
I'll bury you there.

1421
01:59:07,475 --> 01:59:09,727
I'll avenge my brother Jagara.

1422
01:59:09,852 --> 01:59:12,021
Say your prayers.

1423
01:59:12,355 --> 01:59:14,148
I can wait that long.

1424
01:59:25,034 --> 01:59:26,744
<i>Deceitful Shinsengumi!</i>

1425
01:59:27,036 --> 01:59:28,496
I'll slay you dead!

1426
01:59:29,413 --> 01:59:32,792
Oh no, this is Commander Kondo
and Hijikata-san.

1427
01:59:32,875 --> 01:59:34,043
Shut up!

1428
01:59:34,669 --> 01:59:36,170
Don't get in my way!

1429
01:59:50,184 --> 01:59:53,062
They almost killed each
other at the same time.

1430
01:59:54,313 --> 01:59:55,564
A Kotetsu...

1431
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:59,318
It surely is a Kotetsu,
but yours is shadowed.

1432
01:59:59,652 --> 02:00:01,195
A deceitful Kotetsu!

1433
02:00:01,821 --> 02:00:03,698
No Kotetsu can be shadowed!

1434
02:00:03,823 --> 02:00:04,907
Shut up!

1435
02:00:10,705 --> 02:00:11,914
Hey, you...

1436
02:00:12,581 --> 02:00:15,042
When you aim at someone
with a gun,

1437
02:00:15,793 --> 02:00:18,045
you'd better take careful aim.

1438
02:01:18,147 --> 02:01:21,150
- Kotetsu-kun.
- What now?

1439
02:01:21,609 --> 02:01:25,112
The blunder is mine.
Forgive me.

1440
02:01:25,654 --> 02:01:28,407
Sasaki... And Aguri...

1441
02:01:29,742 --> 02:01:31,660
Please forgive Kondo.

1442
02:01:32,286 --> 02:01:34,789
- Please!
- No way!

1443
02:01:42,296 --> 02:01:43,380
Aguri...

1444
02:01:44,381 --> 02:01:45,633
Aguri.

1445
02:01:51,263 --> 02:01:52,556
Aguri!

1446
02:01:59,897 --> 02:02:01,315
But Why?

1447
02:02:08,823 --> 02:02:13,202
Those two were innocent
and pure.

1448
02:02:17,164 --> 02:02:18,666
Like flower buds...

1449
02:02:22,044 --> 02:02:23,462
So pitiful...

1450
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:28,592
and beautiful...

1451
02:02:29,593 --> 02:02:31,554
Aren't they beautiful?

1452
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:37,351
- Thank you.
- You're wrong.

1453
02:02:41,856 --> 02:02:43,858
To hell with beauty.

1454
02:02:45,442 --> 02:02:46,861
Thank him?

1455
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:54,076
The most beautiful vision
of a woman is when she...

1456
02:02:56,954 --> 02:02:59,999
stays with a man she loves
for life,

1457
02:03:02,251 --> 02:03:05,963
and bears his children...

1458
02:03:08,841 --> 02:03:10,342
and brings them up...

1459
02:03:16,015 --> 02:03:17,391
Brings them up...

1460
02:03:20,978 --> 02:03:22,479
But she...

1461
02:03:25,774 --> 02:03:26,984
No...

1462
02:03:30,154 --> 02:03:34,283
SEPTEMBER 18

1463
02:03:38,746 --> 02:03:41,165
SHINSENGUMI
CAMP

1464
02:04:28,295 --> 02:04:29,463
Yamazaki!

1465
02:04:29,838 --> 02:04:31,715
NOW! Go!

1466
02:04:33,342 --> 02:04:36,095
- Quick, draw it!
- I can't...

1467
02:05:04,623 --> 02:05:06,959
Come. Quick.

1468
02:05:18,637 --> 02:05:19,847
Die!

1469
02:05:56,300 --> 02:05:58,385
Beheaded, according to our code.

1470
02:05:59,428 --> 02:06:01,680
So, rest assured.

1471
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:22,701
Now... let's go.

1472
02:06:29,958 --> 02:06:33,587
NEW YEAR'S EVE

1473
02:06:35,547 --> 02:06:36,673
Hey.

1474
02:06:42,304 --> 02:06:43,555
What's this?

1475
02:06:44,223 --> 02:06:46,475
An arrest, as you can see.

1476
02:06:47,351 --> 02:06:48,727
Guess who?

1477
02:06:49,061 --> 02:06:51,230
The famous Izo the Manslayer.

1478
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:54,483
Or what's left of Izo Okada,
of Tosa.

1479
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:55,859
Eh?

1480
02:07:00,364 --> 02:07:03,992
The pro-imperialist group of Tosa
has had its day.

1481
02:07:04,118 --> 02:07:06,370
But now is the time of
the coalition.

1482
02:07:06,829 --> 02:07:09,248
He's nothing other than
a murderer now.

1483
02:07:09,456 --> 02:07:12,376
A wanted criminal with
nowhere to go.

1484
02:07:12,459 --> 02:07:15,587
He changed his looks,
got hooked on women,

1485
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:18,132
gambling...
He was a regular at your den,

1486
02:07:18,632 --> 02:07:21,969
he ended up committing burglary,
and got...

1487
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:23,971
tracked down.
His luck ran out.

1488
02:07:24,096 --> 02:07:26,974
But how long will you
leave him like this for?

1489
02:07:27,015 --> 02:07:28,267
He's freezing.

1490
02:07:28,267 --> 02:07:30,519
We're tying up his
female accomplice.

1491
02:07:30,644 --> 02:07:33,522
They were naked when
we arrived.

1492
02:07:33,772 --> 02:07:37,651
He'll be okay like this,
but the woman needs some clothes.

1493
02:07:54,793 --> 02:07:56,295
What on earth...

1494
02:07:56,879 --> 02:07:58,046
Hey, Yamazaki!

1495
02:07:58,297 --> 02:08:00,674
How dare you tie up a woman!

1496
02:08:01,049 --> 02:08:03,552
This place is for passing customers.

1497
02:08:03,677 --> 02:08:06,513
She can't be responsible
for every one of them.

1498
02:08:06,638 --> 02:08:09,057
- Why are you so...
- Upset? I am!

1499
02:08:09,516 --> 02:08:11,685
Beat her up for information that...

1500
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:13,812
you should already have known?

1501
02:08:13,937 --> 02:08:16,815
Both the Shinsengumi and
the authorities are pathetic.

1502
02:08:18,066 --> 02:08:21,153
I can't take you hurting
an innocent woman like this.

1503
02:08:21,278 --> 02:08:22,321
You morons!

1504
02:08:22,446 --> 02:08:24,573
All right, all right, I got it.

1505
02:08:24,823 --> 02:08:26,700
Release this woman,
will you?

1506
02:08:26,825 --> 02:08:28,952
- But...
- Shut up!

1507
02:08:29,077 --> 02:08:31,205
I'll take responsibility for this.

1508
02:08:35,834 --> 02:08:37,419
<i>- Hey.
- Yes'?</i>

1509
02:08:39,838 --> 02:08:42,341
Hurry up! Tell him.

1510
02:08:42,674 --> 02:08:44,343
Hurry up, quick.

1511
02:09:37,271 --> 02:09:39,523
<i>Hey. Let's get moving.</i>

1512
02:09:48,532 --> 02:09:49,408
Hey.

1513
02:09:54,871 --> 02:09:56,373
- Stand up.
- Wait!

1514
02:10:09,511 --> 02:10:10,929
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1515
02:10:19,938 --> 02:10:21,940
What about my position, huh?

1516
02:11:00,312 --> 02:11:02,481
Did that come from Kyoto?

1517
02:11:02,731 --> 02:11:05,317
- Eh?
- The bell.

1518
02:11:07,861 --> 02:11:09,488
I don't know.

1519
02:11:13,075 --> 02:11:14,326
Well...

1520
02:11:15,869 --> 02:11:19,331
Back when I wandered through...

1521
02:11:19,998 --> 02:11:23,752
Koshiji... and Shinano,

1522
02:11:29,132 --> 02:11:31,635
I was attacked by...

1523
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:36,348
some robbers who were
Ronins, so I...

1524
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:37,516
Ronins?

1525
02:11:37,891 --> 02:11:42,145
There were three of them.
No asking or telling. Nothing.

1526
02:11:42,896 --> 02:11:47,609
We got into a fight,
and I killed all three of them.

1527
02:11:49,236 --> 02:11:53,490
Actually, the Ronin with this
clay bell was called...

1528
02:11:54,408 --> 02:11:56,410
"Watada" by one of his comrades.

1529
02:12:02,249 --> 02:12:05,919
It's strange...
I wonder why I told you this story.

1530
02:12:07,754 --> 02:12:11,133
- Watada?
- Yes.

1531
02:12:15,262 --> 02:12:18,682
I live here alone and
practice this profession.

1532
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:20,809
Please stop by for a while.

1533
02:12:24,771 --> 02:12:27,524
You killed my father!
Be prepared!

1534
02:12:28,650 --> 02:12:30,193
At least explain!

1535
02:12:31,445 --> 02:12:34,698
The man you killed was
Yasumasa Watada,

1536
02:12:34,823 --> 02:12:36,324
and I'm his daughter, Naka.

1537
02:12:36,450 --> 02:12:39,578
That clay bell was made by
my father for me.

1538
02:12:39,661 --> 02:12:40,704
Look!

1539
02:12:50,589 --> 02:12:52,674
In the countryside of Echizen,

1540
02:12:53,967 --> 02:12:57,095
I lived with my father and mother.

1541
02:12:58,722 --> 02:13:00,223
We made clay bells...

1542
02:13:00,849 --> 02:13:04,978
and sold them to shrines here
and there to make our living.

1543
02:13:05,812 --> 02:13:09,316
- Father became committed to the
Sonno-joi... - And became a robber.

1544
02:13:09,483 --> 02:13:10,692
Killed by you!

1545
02:13:10,817 --> 02:13:14,571
A man must care for his wife
and children above all.

1546
02:13:14,738 --> 02:13:16,990
How's your mother doing now?

1547
02:13:17,449 --> 02:13:20,202
My mother... she passed away...

1548
02:13:20,368 --> 02:13:24,456
three years ago, worrying about father,
who'd disappeared.

1549
02:13:24,581 --> 02:13:26,124
I searched for my father.

1550
02:13:26,249 --> 02:13:28,627
Why seek revenge for such a father?

1551
02:13:28,752 --> 02:13:29,753
Coward!

1552
02:13:31,379 --> 02:13:32,380
Listen...

1553
02:13:32,506 --> 02:13:34,841
Your father was a robber
at that time.

1554
02:13:37,844 --> 02:13:41,014
He attacked my wife and I.

1555
02:13:42,015 --> 02:13:44,643
He tried to steal, to kill me,

1556
02:13:45,018 --> 02:13:48,772
yo take my sword, to kidnap
my wife and to rape her.

1557
02:13:49,523 --> 02:13:51,900
His acts were unforgivable!

1558
02:13:52,025 --> 02:13:55,862
As his child, I must avenge him.
It's unforgivable!

1559
02:13:56,780 --> 02:13:57,989
Eh?

1560
02:14:12,754 --> 02:14:15,924
- Kill me!
- Shut up!

1561
02:14:17,884 --> 02:14:19,553
You know what, Naka-san?

1562
02:14:21,179 --> 02:14:25,183
I can't stand that you are
feeling hurt in this way.

1563
02:14:36,653 --> 02:14:38,405
I am Kotetsu, of Aizu.

1564
02:14:39,656 --> 02:14:42,200
My home is in Sannomiya,
south of Shomen.

1565
02:14:42,325 --> 02:14:44,202
I won't run or hide.

1566
02:14:48,331 --> 02:14:53,962
I'd rather you... gave up
this profession.

1567
02:14:57,090 --> 02:14:58,216
All right?

1568
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:08,184
NEXT SPRING, THE NAME
OF THE ERA CHANGES...

1569
02:15:08,184 --> 02:15:10,061
TO GENJI (1864) NEXT SPRING,
THE NAME OF THE ERA CHANGES...

1570
02:15:10,061 --> 02:15:13,356
TO GENJI (1864)

1571
02:15:13,732 --> 02:15:14,065
The masseur...

1572
02:15:14,065 --> 02:15:15,734
JUNE
The masseur...

1573
02:15:15,734 --> 02:15:17,485
JUNE

1574
02:15:18,236 --> 02:15:22,240
Are you relieved that
Shinbei's the masseur?

1575
02:15:22,574 --> 02:15:25,744
No, I mean the inn, Ikeda-ya...

1576
02:15:25,869 --> 02:15:27,704
<i>Ah... Around Same.</i>

1577
02:15:27,746 --> 02:15:32,709
- He said he can't earn much there.
- Why is that?

1578
02:15:32,834 --> 02:15:35,712
That inn is busy with
samurai these days.

1579
02:15:39,257 --> 02:15:43,637
Whenever he's called there,
the customer will have...

1580
02:15:43,762 --> 02:15:47,766
visitors who are Ronins or associates,
and say "Excuse me,"

1581
02:15:47,891 --> 02:15:51,519
then leave the room to
meet them while he waits.

1582
02:15:51,645 --> 02:15:55,649
As soon as the customer returns,
another visitor shows up.

1583
02:15:55,732 --> 02:16:00,654
The visitor leaves and he starts
his massage, then another one shows up.

1584
02:16:01,738 --> 02:16:03,406
Difficult to make money...

1585
02:16:03,531 --> 02:16:06,868
Do you know where these samurai
come from?

1586
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:10,246
From Choshu and Higo and...

1587
02:16:11,164 --> 02:16:14,292
Tosa and also a bit of
Himeji dialect...

1588
02:16:18,004 --> 02:16:23,051
Senkichi-san, if we head south from
this Togetsukyo Bridge,

1589
02:16:23,051 --> 02:16:26,554
past Koke-dera Temple,
Matsuo, and Katsura,

1590
02:16:27,055 --> 02:16:30,684
the road leads all the way
down to Osaka.

1591
02:16:33,645 --> 02:16:34,813
Senkichi-san...

1592
02:16:35,939 --> 02:16:37,816
Take me back to Osaka.

1593
02:16:39,693 --> 02:16:41,361
Let's go back together.

1594
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:44,114
Right now.

1595
02:16:45,615 --> 02:16:47,117
Tomi-chan!

1596
02:16:48,743 --> 02:16:50,578
Or will you take this story...

1597
02:16:51,246 --> 02:16:53,707
back to Kyoto,
to alarm the Shinsengumi?

1598
02:16:54,207 --> 02:16:55,625
What's your choice?

1599
02:16:58,002 --> 02:17:01,589
Senkichi-san, do you love me?

1600
02:17:02,257 --> 02:17:05,385
Or hate me?
Tell me now!

1601
02:17:05,385 --> 02:17:09,723
I like you.
I like you, but... See?

1602
02:17:09,764 --> 02:17:11,599
Answer me!

1603
02:17:12,517 --> 02:17:13,393
THE SAME DAY

1604
02:17:13,393 --> 02:17:18,898
THE SAME DAY
JUNE 5, 1864

1605
02:17:22,902 --> 02:17:26,781
IKEDA-YA INN

1606
02:17:36,416 --> 02:17:38,793
- Wait!
- Out of the way!

1607
02:18:56,496 --> 02:18:57,622
Why...

1608
02:18:59,374 --> 02:19:00,500
Why?

1609
02:19:05,964 --> 02:19:07,006
Orin...

1610
02:19:09,133 --> 02:19:12,470
I've given my best for
every one of them...

1611
02:19:14,722 --> 02:19:16,724
That's the only way I know.

1612
02:19:20,270 --> 02:19:21,771
For you,

1613
02:19:23,147 --> 02:19:25,275
for Aguri-chan,
for Tomi-chan...

1614
02:19:28,862 --> 02:19:30,864
and for this woman.

1615
02:19:33,658 --> 02:19:35,285
And yet...

1616
02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:38,496
Why?

1617
02:20:29,422 --> 02:20:30,048
<i>Orin, the war broke out,</i>

1618
02:20:30,048 --> 02:20:31,925
JULY 19, 1864, AT DAWN
Orin, the war broke out,

1619
02:20:31,925 --> 02:20:34,093
<i>JULY 19,1864, AT DAWN triggered by the
Ikeda-ya Incident, the attack of Choshu.</i>

1620
02:20:34,093 --> 02:20:36,054
<i>triggered by the Ikeda-ya Incident,
the attack of Choshu.</i>

1621
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:45,063
<i>The enemy sneaked up on Saga
and rushed into the city.</i>

1622
02:20:45,313 --> 02:20:48,733
<i>They attacked the Hamaguri-gomon gate
of the Imperial Palace.</i>

1623
02:20:50,109 --> 02:20:53,821
Damn it!
The Palace is in danger!

1624
02:20:54,113 --> 02:20:57,450
The Shinsengumi are heading
back to Kyoto!

1625
02:20:57,575 --> 02:20:59,494
Gather around, Shinsengumi!

1626
02:21:00,119 --> 02:21:01,871
We're going back to Kyoto!

1627
02:21:05,583 --> 02:21:06,960
Kondo-san...

1628
02:21:07,877 --> 02:21:11,881
Are you planning to fight
in the middle of the city?

1629
02:21:12,006 --> 02:21:15,510
That's where the enemy is.
We have to fight. This is war.

1630
02:21:15,635 --> 02:21:17,261
What about Kyoto?

1631
02:21:18,846 --> 02:21:21,391
What about the people living there?

1632
02:21:21,641 --> 02:21:23,518
Is that friendship?

1633
02:21:23,893 --> 02:21:25,520
Would a friend do that?

1634
02:21:25,853 --> 02:21:29,148
Kotetsu-kun, both you
and us bet on Aizu.

1635
02:21:29,482 --> 02:21:31,776
That is, on the Tokugawa Shogunate.

1636
02:21:32,151 --> 02:21:34,362
We must annihilate its enemies.

1637
02:21:35,863 --> 02:21:37,907
That's all there is right now.

1638
02:21:38,908 --> 02:21:40,034
Let's go!

1639
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:56,759
<i>An incident later known as
the Hamaguri Rebellion,</i>

1640
02:21:57,802 --> 02:22:00,555
<i>the origin of Kyoto's
Dondon-yam</i>

1641
02:22:00,555 --> 02:22:05,435
<i>the origin of Kyoto's
Dondon-yam In Kyoto</i>

1642
02:22:23,453 --> 02:22:25,580
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1643
02:22:25,705 --> 02:22:27,290
Where's Oyabun?

1644
02:22:28,207 --> 02:22:30,835
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1645
02:22:31,419 --> 02:22:34,338
lroha! Ueba!

1646
02:22:34,589 --> 02:22:37,800
Heikichi! Inosuke!

1647
02:22:39,177 --> 02:22:40,720
Sanjo

1648
02:23:30,144 --> 02:23:31,479
Orin.

1649
02:23:32,647 --> 02:23:34,398
My bet...

1650
02:23:35,483 --> 02:23:38,528
I might have lost it...

1651
02:23:41,781 --> 02:23:43,032
Senkichi-san.

1652
02:23:51,165 --> 02:23:54,168
Gionmachi was intact. Come!

1653
02:23:54,377 --> 02:23:55,795
With your precious...

1654
02:23:57,672 --> 02:23:59,006
If Kotaro,

1655
02:23:59,757 --> 02:24:02,927
Kumagoro, Inosuke,

1656
02:24:04,137 --> 02:24:05,680
and that kid Heikichi...

1657
02:24:06,305 --> 02:24:11,185
were all safe, they would
come back here.

1658
02:24:11,435 --> 02:24:13,146
I have to wait for them.

1659
02:24:13,437 --> 02:24:15,773
- You insist?
- But...

1660
02:24:16,691 --> 02:24:20,194
Thank you, Tomi-chan.
Really.

1661
02:24:20,695 --> 02:24:22,071
I mean it.

1662
02:24:24,448 --> 02:24:26,200
You know what, Tomi-chan?

1663
02:24:28,452 --> 02:24:33,040
When I saw your face,
I had this thought...

1664
02:24:34,792 --> 02:24:39,172
You know that I bet on
the Ogaki-ya?

1665
02:24:41,591 --> 02:24:43,968
The Ogaki-ya bet on
the Lord of Aizu.

1666
02:24:45,094 --> 02:24:48,723
The Lord of Aizu bet on
the Shogunate.

1667
02:24:48,973 --> 02:24:51,225
That's why <i>I</i> bet on
the Shogunate...

1668
02:24:56,355 --> 02:24:59,567
Somethings... wrong here.

1669
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:04,614
I have to bet on
my precious someone.

1670
02:25:06,199 --> 02:25:07,491
And that...

1671
02:25:09,243 --> 02:25:12,455
my precious someone is...

1672
02:25:20,504 --> 02:25:21,505
Orin.

1673
02:25:27,261 --> 02:25:28,763
Is that you, Orin?

1674
02:25:29,263 --> 02:25:31,891
- Need some water?
- Senkichi...

1675
02:25:32,892 --> 02:25:33,976
Water!

1676
02:25:34,894 --> 02:25:36,270
There's water here!

1677
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:39,398
Senkichi-san! Don't!

1678
02:25:39,482 --> 02:25:41,234
Where's the bucket?

1679
02:25:44,737 --> 02:25:47,031
<i>There go the Shinsengumi!</i>

1680
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:48,115
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1681
02:25:48,241 --> 02:25:49,784
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1682
02:25:50,243 --> 02:25:51,160
<i>Oyabun.</i>

1683
02:25:51,744 --> 02:25:52,912
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1684
02:25:55,539 --> 02:25:56,624
Kotetsu-kun.

1685
02:25:59,794 --> 02:26:01,170
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1686
02:26:01,879 --> 02:26:03,047
<i>Oyabun!</i>

1687
02:26:13,057 --> 02:26:14,684
I got it.

1688
02:26:29,323 --> 02:26:30,324
Orin!

1689
02:26:32,076 --> 02:26:35,162
I will bet, once again!

1690
02:26:51,178 --> 02:26:58,728
