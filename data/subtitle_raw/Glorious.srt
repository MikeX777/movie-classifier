00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,005
PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL WHEN TRAVELING

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:21,521
Sometimes, you think
you've got it together.

5
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,607
Sometimes, you think
you're on top of the world.

6
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,821
That life is in the palm of your
hands. But the truth is, it's not.

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:35,159
And when you realize that, you will
find yourself falling to pieces.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,580
But you can pull
yourself together again.

9
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,624
Slowly but surely. Otherwise,
you'd never get yourself back.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,418
Here's my fare, mister.

11
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,921
And, yes, you will
make mistakes.

12
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,008
And you will move through life

13
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,053
like you are drifting
through an endless dream.

14
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,016
Every second you
devote to family,

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,895
every waking moment,

16
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,273
all of it, joyless
and meaningless.

17
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,863
But then, one day, you
will meet that one person

18
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,700
who has the power to
wake you from your slumber.

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,703
Will you let them?

20
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,244
Did you enjoy
your birthday, Niko?

21
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,788
Actually,

22
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,541
it's not my birthday today.

23
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,253
Well…

24
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,255
Wait…

25
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,381
Are you even single?

26
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,591
Tell me the truth.

27
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,762
Of course. I'm 22 years old,
single, and at your service.

28
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,724
- Wait!
- Keep it down, madam.

29
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,185
Manuel likes you, by the way.

30
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,231
Him.

31
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,983
You know what?

32
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,694
Oh my God,

33
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,946
I can't…

34
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,451
My youngest kid is
a year older than you.

35
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,497
I'm old enough to
be your grandma!

36
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,057
You're one beautiful,
sexy grandma.

37
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,143
Let me guess how old you are.

38
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,653
As I said, I'm old enough
to be your grandma.

39
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,618
Doesn't matter. You're still
one beautiful, sexy grandma.

40
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,682
You know what?

41
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,310
I don't care.

42
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,522
I like you.

43
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,359
And that's all that matters.

44
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,379
How about you?

45
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,425
Did you enjoy it?

46
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,641
I like you too.

47
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,982
Let me.

48
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,525
All right.

49
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,111
You're as light as
a Kawasaki Ninja.

50
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,324
I can't imagine… Seven
years without sex?

51
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:34,620
I guess.

52
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,290
I was just waiting
for the right man.

53
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,500
Looks like you've found him.

54
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,524
Was it worth the wait?

55
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,696
You know what?

56
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,991
Honestly…

57
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,871
I feel safe with you.

58
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,499
And this,

59
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,585
I've always wanted this

60
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,215
because my husband
never made me feel this way.

61
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,966
He was cold.

62
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,427
He had no time for me.

63
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,638
He was always
heading off somewhere.

64
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,267
I thought I was the problem.

65
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,478
Honestly,

66
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,314
I've never felt this
good until now.

67
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,487
All I ever did was go along
with whatever he wanted.

68
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,697
That's just how it was.

69
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,701
That's funny though.

70
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,065
You keep insisting we shouldn't
text each other after this.

71
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,419
Can you really forget about me?

72
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,099
Wait.

73
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,394
Niko, no…

74
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,772
Stay here.

75
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,482
Just stay here.

76
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,847
I didn't do too badly, right?

77
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,248
- Mom?
- Oh, it's you.

78
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,753
The prayer meeting
ended later than usual?

79
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,462
Yeah.

80
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,756
I was going to wear that.

81
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,592
Can you lend me a denim skirt?

82
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,595
- It's over there.
- Okay.

83
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,475
By the way, Ma.

84
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,685
The delivery guy called.

85
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,314
He said the delivery
would be made later today?

86
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,608
- Okay.
- Yeah.

87
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,693
- Thanks.
- Sure.

88
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,529
Damn it, Gloria.

89
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,282
I told you to buy a new lamp!

90
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,409
I only come home once a month.

91
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,454
Am I asking too much of you?

92
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,749
You really are useless
around the house.

93
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,168
I forgot, okay?

94
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,294
I'm sorry.

95
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:16,633
I forgot all about it because I got
busy, and my pottery wheel broke.

96
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,759
- Okay?
- Seriously?

97
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,637
Do you even remember anything?

98
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,057
I thought it was just your
eyesight that was going bad.

99
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,728
Apparently, it's
something worse.

100
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,691
I wasted so much
money on that operation.

101
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:38,155
Hey. You're the reason that I got
a tumor in the first place, okay?

102
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,908
For nine years,
all I ever did was...

103
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,620
- All right, that's enough.
- You had a kid with her!

104
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,082
Don't you ever shut up?

105
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,670
I give you money, so
I'm doing my part, okay?

106
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:57,006
The only reason you got your
dignity back was because of me.

107
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,135
The bank fired you,
and you deserved it.

108
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,722
Because you're useless!
You can't do anything right.

109
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,517
Was I wrong for
trusting my client?

110
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,394
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

111
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,146
Because I expect
nothing from you.

112
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,147
Here.

113
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,444
Go to the mall and
buy a new lamp.

114
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,196
On second thought,

115
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,035
just text me once you've
picked out something.

116
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,996
I'll pay for it there.

117
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,302
Goodness. Mike's never
going to change, is he?

118
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:46,766
If he was as hot as he is
hot-hotheaded, I probably wouldn't mind.

119
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,643
Do you want to get him back?

120
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,563
Not at all. I'm not
playing wife number two.

121
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,149
So, do you miss him?

122
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,909
Wow! I thought he'd be the
first and last man in your life.

123
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,497
He was my first, yes, but I
hope he won't be my last!

124
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:15,001
- I mean, you know what happened, right?
- I know!

125
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,297
Well, you seem to have
come to terms with this.

126
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:23,469
Look, I just don't
want to be so…

127
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:32,061
You know, I put a lot of
effort into staying positive.

128
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,815
The thing is, I just
want to be happy.

129
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,279
…for what he did
with his secretary.

130
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,907
Then you're officially
back on the market.

131
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,535
You have to put in
some work, okay?

132
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,996
Look, just go for it.

133
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:57,878
- Your biological clock's ticking.
- I know! Oh my God!

134
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,508
When was the last
time you had sex?

135
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,512
I don't even remember.

136
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,472
But you know what?
It doesn't matter.

137
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,684
I'm perfectly fine without it.

138
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,236
- Remittance?
- Yes.

139
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,779
Account number, please.

140
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,407
Is it good to go? Thanks.

141
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,994
Mom?

142
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,871
Did you get the money?

143
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,458
I'm not going back
home this weekend.

144
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,419
Right, his birthday's coming up.

145
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,882
Could you buy some
chocolate croissants for him?

146
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,175
Maybe six of them.

147
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,471
You'll get five. 500, yeah.

148
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,933
Yes, of course. You have
nothing to worry about.

149
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,657
It won't take long.
Hurry up, okay?

150
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,368
You've got one hour, okay?

151
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,129
- Hey, you're here.
- Thanks, man.

152
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,547
Did Salazar notice?

153
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,466
No, you came back just in time.

154
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,468
All right.

155
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,596
- Can you help me, mister?
- What is it?

156
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,307
- I'm looking for lamps.
- Wait here, please.

157
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,100
- Hey?
- What?

158
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,311
You have a customer.

159
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,938
Wait.

160
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,108
He's our best salesman.

161
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,778
He will show you around.

162
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,154
You owe me one, okay?

163
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,449
Hello. May I know
what you're looking for?

164
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,659
Light.

165
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,203
Wow, is that so?

166
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:01,668
I need a lamp for a table.

167
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,713
- Okay.
- Do you have a long one?

168
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,840
You know, one with…

169
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,800
A neck.

170
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,511
And a head on top.

171
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,430
A light, I mean.

172
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,891
How about this?

173
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,604
Niko's the best salesman here.
You can learn a lot from him.

174
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,398
He's got this. Believe me.

175
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,067
He's sold five
already. Me? Nada.

176
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,154
That's because
you're slacking off.

177
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,447
Get back to work.

178
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,908
That one's nice.

179
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,368
Are you taking it?

180
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,619
Can I come back for it later?

181
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,622
Absolutely. I'll
take care of it.

182
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,708
Don't worry.

183
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,419
Can I get your number?

184
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,714
All right.

185
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,841
My husband will stop by later.

186
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:55,055
If he is happy with
this, he'll take it. Okay?

187
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,681
Got it.

188
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,268
No problem.

189
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,229
Food's here!

190
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,523
Oh, wow.

191
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,234
- What do you think?
- Just stay here, okay?

192
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,653
- I can't.
- But Sam cooked for us.

193
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,031
And Mom's birthday is
coming up soon. Mine too.

194
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,742
Someone's driving me to Manila.

195
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,162
- I can't keep him waiting.
- Please?

196
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,874
- Fine, how about…
- okay.

197
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,754
Here. Go buy yourself
a T-shirt, okay?

198
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,755
Very funny, Dad.

199
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,550
You need to cover up a bit.

200
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,092
Yeah?

201
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,303
- Can you give me money too?
- What?

202
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,805
- Come on.
- Give me a break.

203
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,268
- Your eldest son deserves the best.
- All right. Here.

204
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,813
- Oh, brother.
- Just relax, Mike.

205
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,065
What's the rush?

206
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,734
- Well, you know me.
- Have something to eat first.

207
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,028
No, it's fine.

208
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,492
Gloria. Here.

209
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,828
This should be
enough for everything.

210
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,003
Just take it.

211
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,757
Did you see the lamp
your mom picked out?

212
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,510
It's pretty ugly, isn't it?

213
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,097
You want to come
with me to Manila?

214
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,646
- Come on, Dad.
- Okay.

215
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,064
I have to go now.

216
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,482
- Take care.
- Thanks.

217
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,692
- Bye, Pa.
- Bye.

218
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,572
This is good!

219
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,574
Wait, is that my phone?

220
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,827
I think so.

221
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,703
Who's this?

222
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,082
- How is it?
- It's good.

223
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,085
It's me, Niko, the
hardware shop salesman.

224
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,255
Looks like your husband didn't
like the lamp you picked out.

225
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,381
He told me

226
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,466
that, well,

227
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,053
you didn't have good taste.

228
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,224
Yeah, I know. He
told me already.

229
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,686
But you picked out a good one.

230
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,274
Why don't you drop
by the store again?

231
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,736
We'll pick a good one this time.
I'm sure we'll find something.

232
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,448
Okay, thanks.

233
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,576
Thanks. Bye.

234
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,953
Come on, let's eat!

235
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,415
- Jibs.
- Yeah?

236
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,463
What are you doing here?

237
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,758
I drove her here. Again.

238
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,058
Issa.

239
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,395
I missed you so much.

240
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,441
You have no idea, babe.

241
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,278
Issa, you have to go home.

242
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,329
You have to go home.

243
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,581
All right, let's go back home.

244
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,833
Come on, babe.

245
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,294
Come on.

246
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,470
Help me out here.

247
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,601
- Watch her head.
- Yeah.

248
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,064
Oh, Issa.

249
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,652
I'll leave you to it, Jibs.

250
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,404
Make sure she gets home safely.

251
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,919
Lea?

252
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,546
- Thank you.
- No problem.

253
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,424
- To you and Brenda.
- Don't mention it.

254
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,010
Thank you for
this. I appreciate it.

255
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,137
It's no big deal, okay?

256
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,181
I love you, Glory.

257
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,899
- You know what?
- What?

258
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,026
You're really lucky.

259
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,571
Because you've managed to
overcome all your problems.

260
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,326
It was amazing to see
you get right back up.

261
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,872
You bounced back
like they were nothing.

262
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,002
You've led a colorful
life, and you're so blessed.

263
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,297
Are you happy right now?

264
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,097
Well…

265
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,439
I have no money.

266
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,613
I've lost my husband.

267
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,533
My career.

268
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,455
Everything I've
worked so hard for

269
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,414
is gone.

270
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:17,461
I've got nothing left because
I've made so many bad decisions.

271
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,466
Oh, come on, Glory.

272
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:28,721
Yes, you lost your job. But at least
you have the life skills to make it.

273
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:33,476
And you're in good health right
now. That's all that matters. Okay?

274
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,730
And you raised your kids well.

275
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,066
They love you so much.

276
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,819
Brenda and I do too.

277
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,656
You will bounce back
completely. I know you will.

278
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,202
Glory.

279
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,375
I'm just really
trying my best, Lea.

280
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,339
You know what, honestly?

281
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,094
The only thing I
want for my birthday

282
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,348
is to have someone beside me.

283
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,099
Yes.

284
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,728
- Right?
- Of course.

285
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,856
I want to have someone to
wake up with every morning.

286
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,359
Me too.

287
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,362
Okay.

288
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,879
HOW ARE YOU?

289
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,131
NIKO WHO?

290
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,841
FROM THE HARDWARE
SHOP, REMEMBER?

291
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,717
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU.

292
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,679
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
HELPED ME OUT LAST TIME?

293
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,474
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

294
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,311
LET'S MEET. YOU WON'T
FORGET ME THIS TIME.

295
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,729
HAVE YOU HAD BREAKFAST YET?

296
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,566
NOT YET, AND MY HANDS
ARE ALL DIRTY RIGHT NOW.

297
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,235
YOU'RE INTO FARMING? MY
PARENTS ARE FARMERS TOO.

298
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:09,280
NO, I DON'T DO FARMING. I
MAKE AND SELL POTTERY.

299
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,824
YOU MAKE POTS?
SO, YOU'RE AN ARTIST?

300
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,243
SORT OF, YEAH.

301
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,662
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ARTSY TYPES.
YOU MUST MAKE LOTS OF MONEY.

302
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,580
Just somebody.

303
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,664
ACTUALLY, I'M JOBLESS.

304
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,041
YOU DON'T LOOK IT AT ALL.
YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY TOO.

305
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,543
Come on, you're always texting.

306
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,878
OH, ENOUGH WITH THE FLATTERY.

307
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,588
I GOT LUCKY THAT DAY, YOU KNOW?

308
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,716
I SOLD TWO MORE AFTER YOU LEFT.

309
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,223
LET'S MEET, MY TREAT! WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE DINING SPOT?

310
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,646
VIZCO'S. THEIR SWEETS
ARE JUST PERFECT.

311
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,901
I HAVEN'T EATEN THERE…

312
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:51,364
MY BIRTHDAY'S COMING
UP TOO. SO, VIZCO'S IT IS?

313
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,875
She said yes!

314
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,836
Good on you, man!

315
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,255
- Are you good, sir?
- Yeah.

316
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,508
All right, I'll take care of it.

317
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,093
Congrats, man.

318
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,141
Oh my gosh…

319
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,977
Here's my fare, mister.

320
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,814
Oh, it's you, Glory.

321
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,566
It's been a long time.

322
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,443
Have you heard?

323
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:36,283
They'll be holding prayer meetings
on Thursdays starting next month.

324
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:40,455
Can you keep me
updated on that, Carol?

325
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,918
Where are you off to?
You look even lovelier now.

326
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,004
I'm meeting up with a
friend at Session Road.

327
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,090
Come again?

328
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,050
- I have to buy something.
- I see.

329
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,051
All right, then.

330
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,727
Excuse me, mister. I'm
getting off here, please.

331
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,271
- I forgot something.
- I see.

332
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,815
- See you, then.
- Yeah.

333
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,902
- Bye, take care.
- You too. Bye.

334
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,996
It's me, Niko.

335
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,417
Remember me now?

336
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,837
Come on, our table's this way.

337
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,220
Here.

338
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,980
You look different.

339
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,567
Busted. You said you didn't
remember what I looked like.

340
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,777
No, I mean...

341
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,446
So, how can I look different?

342
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,368
Well, you actually
look like Keanu Reeves.

343
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,790
This looks good.

344
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,512
Let's eat.

345
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,476
It's my first time here.

346
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,394
Mine too.

347
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,063
I thought this was
your favorite place?

348
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,192
It's my first time
doing this, I mean.

349
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,569
Same here.

350
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,656
I can't afford to
eat here, that's why.

351
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,616
Well, I only come here
on special occasions.

352
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,660
My birthday's special?

353
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,621
As you said, we're here, so…

354
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,082
Yes, sure, it's special.

355
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,626
Hey, I'm not into flattery.

356
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,840
But I do practice the seven
key steps to successful selling.

357
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,396
How do you know that?

358
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,654
From what branch are you?

359
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,158
Oh my God, that
was a long time ago.

360
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,079
I'd only just
graduated back then.

361
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
How about you?

362
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,583
Here at Session Road.

363
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,086
I didn't finish the
course though.

364
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,590
So, do I make a good salesman?

365
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,719
Definitely.

366
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,596
You're really good at this.

367
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,394
I need to go to the restroom.

368
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,439
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, no problem.

369
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,487
Did you see that
cute guy earlier?

370
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,906
Yeah, he was so hot! I wish
I'd been the one serving him!

371
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,450
The woman he's with is prettier.

372
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,910
Yeah, but she's old.

373
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,536
You're right.

374
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,246
I'll serve him some water later.

375
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,749
Good idea!

376
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,919
Wait, I have to go.

377
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,181
Can we…

378
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,267
Go somewhere else?

379
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,938
Somewhere where
no one can see me?

380
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,899
Sure. Wait.

381
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,403
One more for takeout, please.
And could I have the bill?

382
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,913
Are you okay?

383
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,332
Why didn't you
put the helmet on?

384
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,337
- I get it.
- No, it's not that!

385
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,588
It's just,

386
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:46,427
I'm just not used to
riding motorcycles.

387
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,518
Look.

388
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,521
Your hands are really cold!

389
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,232
You were driving too fast!

390
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,276
Come on.

391
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,366
You smell good.

392
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,204
You really do.

393
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,573
It's good, right?

394
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,705
You eat like a pig.

395
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,338
I think we can finish this.

396
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,573
We can't do this anymore, okay?

397
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,659
Are you on a diet?

398
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,704
If you are, then stop.
You don't need it at all.

399
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,458
I'm serious, okay? Niko…

400
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,500
I'm ser...

401
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,502
It's good, right?

402
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,178
This is wrong, Niko. It's...

403
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,722
This is wrong, okay? Niko!

404
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,767
- Delicious.
- This is wrong.

405
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,726
You're right.

406
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,415
Is this okay?

407
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,175
I'm listening.

408
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,596
What?

409
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,390
When I have something
important to talk about,

410
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,394
I put on my best clothes.
That's what Grandma taught me.

411
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,061
Well?

412
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,482
Go on.

413
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,069
I'm a married woman.

414
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,324
I know.

415
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,246
But you don't love him.

416
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,961
Does he love you?

417
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,852
Do you like me?

418
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,160
You're beautiful.

419
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:55,041
I'm being serious, Niko!

420
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,043
Come on.

421
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,801
We can't do this again.

422
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,220
Once I leave this place,

423
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,431
don't text me ever again.

424
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,936
Can I be serious for a minute?

425
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,647
I don't like where
this is going.

426
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,402
I want to be with you, Glory.

427
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,952
Is that okay with you?

428
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,875
Well?

429
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,145
I'm scared.

430
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,856
I thought it was settled?

431
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,776
Look.

432
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,987
He might beat you up.

433
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,158
It's okay

434
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,661
because I can take him on.

435
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,375
You're a married woman, Glory.
This is asking for trouble.

436
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,295
That's what I
thought at first too.

437
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,589
I told myself

438
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,551
that after that night,
it would be over.

439
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,974
But he was so persistent.

440
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:39,060
He was so caring, Lea.

441
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,728
He was so nice.

442
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,189
He's a great guy.

443
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,068
You're seriously gushing
over this short-term fling?

444
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,029
Over a guy who's half our age?

445
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,117
Come on! I would never
hook up with Bryan!

446
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,744
He's my godson.

447
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,539
So, why hook up with a guy
the same age as your godson?

448
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,833
You're not playing auntie
to him, too, are you?

449
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,210
What if you get pregnant?

450
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,756
Oh my God! I'm too
old to get pregnant!

451
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,052
You're too old for him.

452
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,929
I told you to get back
into the dating pool,

453
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,390
but not with a
guy half your age!

454
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,975
I'm not dating guys my age.

455
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,935
They're all married
anyway, okay?

456
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,813
Date single guys your age.

457
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:28,109
Lea, I'm not looking
for a relationship.

458
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,528
It just happened.

459
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,502
If I hadn't pushed myself
or taken the chance…

460
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,338
If he hadn't been so persistent…

461
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,262
He's not like
other guys his age.

462
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,306
He's completely different.

463
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,308
It's called sex drive, Glory.

464
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,895
Know what? I've been
worried about you lately.

465
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,980
I even told Raffy
I was that worried.

466
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,525
Anyway, I have to go.
Hands off Bryan, okay?

467
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,110
I'm warning you.

468
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:16,033
I have to go now. Please let me
know if Joey's coming over tonight.

469
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,959
Because I let you do
that when I'm here, right?

470
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,377
I hope we're clear on this.

471
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,420
- Yes, Mom.
- Okay, I really have to go.

472
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,924
Wait a sec, where are you going?

473
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,305
We booked Marina for a
mani-pedi session, right?

474
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,685
Can we just do that
tomorrow? Please?

475
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:47,982
But we have a group project
tomorrow. It's due soon.

476
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,068
Anyway, I really have to go now.

477
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,749
You know what Mom's like.

478
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,933
Mom didn't see you, right?

479
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,745
Babe…

480
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,835
Hello, is your mom
there? It's me, Carol.

481
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,920
Can I talk to her?

482
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,466
She's not here. She left early.

483
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,635
She said she was going

484
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,055
to a prayer meeting.

485
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:08,353
That's odd. We're not
holding one until next month.

486
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,104
We haven't been
active for six months.

487
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,941
Anyway, I just wanted to ask if she'll be
coming with me to the wake of a friend.

488
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,320
Just tell her I called, okay?

489
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,327
You smell good.

490
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,996
Of course, because
I was expecting you.

491
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,749
Let me.

492
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,965
Let's eat?

493
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,802
I shredded the
chicken just for you.

494
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,138
Wow. You did this just for me?

495
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:47,392
This is too much. We're
not eating fish, okay?

496
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,603
But thank you. It was
really sweet of you.

497
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,605
Eat up.

498
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:57,236
Grandma taught me to take
good care of the people I love.

499
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,991
You know,

500
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,328
everyone's talking about us.

501
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,291
Who? The neighbors?

502
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,590
Why does it matter?

503
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,219
I don't care about
them or what they think.

504
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,349
But I can't help it,
you know? I mean…

505
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,519
I'm a private person, you know?

506
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,273
And I only trust very
few people with my life.

507
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,611
Is there something to
be embarrassed about?

508
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,574
Not this again.

509
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,952
You know what they think of us.

510
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,455
People think these
kinds of relationships

511
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,417
only happen because
of one of three reasons.

512
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,587
Money, good sex, or a
guy needing a mother figure.

513
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,006
They're wrong.

514
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,883
First and foremost,

515
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,427
it's about connection.

516
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,056
And it doesn't hurt that
you're hot for your age.

517
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,812
You're pulling my leg.

518
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,566
Just eat.

519
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,070
You do this all the time!

520
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,865
Did I just ruin your
dramatic moment?

521
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,075
I know you've got it bad for
me. That's why you're doing this.

522
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,995
- Good one!
- I know you do!

523
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,956
You've got a witty
comeback this time!

524
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,503
And that's why I love you.

525
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,798
Nice one!

526
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,592
Is that it?

527
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,469
Well?

528
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,804
Lame.

529
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,516
- Super lame.
- Am I?

530
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,151
Lame, huh?

531
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,154
Can I?

532
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,707
G?

533
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,460
Promise me, okay?

534
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,548
That this will be the last
time you bring this up.

535
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,138
Look, even if we
were the same age,

536
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,017
if we didn't get along,

537
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,938
we'd still break up.

538
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,570
Just ignore them. What
they think doesn't matter.

539
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,033
We have each other.
That's all that matters.

540
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,756
You want to live together?

541
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,343
Wait.

542
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,558
I'm giving you this.

543
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:22,024
I don't have much,

544
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,442
but I made more
than usual last time.

545
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,445
My boss is pretty
happy with my work.

546
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,950
This money is proof
of all my hard work.

547
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,952
By the way,

548
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:37,247
I just talked to the caretaker.

549
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:42,586
He's moving overseas,

550
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,796
and he's leaving
this place to me.

551
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,468
We have a place of our own now.

552
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,305
We won't have to worry
about rent anymore.

553
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,935
G…

554
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,815
I love you.

555
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,026
I will always be yours.

556
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,281
And this place?
This is yours too.

557
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,370
This place is proof

558
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,872
of just how much you mean to me.

559
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,793
Of just how much I love you.

560
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,548
I love you too.

561
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,984
I have to talk to my kids.

562
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,247
Why are you...

563
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,250
Who is he? Why is he here?

564
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,966
Mia, what's the meaning of this?

565
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,722
Get out!

566
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:22,268
Now, you go back to
your room and get dressed!

567
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,396
You and I are going to talk!

568
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,231
Now, Mia!

569
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,256
I'm really sorry, Mom.

570
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,469
What happened, Mia?

571
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,471
Who was that guy?

572
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,306
Well?

573
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,476
My boyfriend.

574
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,732
Since when? Why do I
know nothing about this?

575
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:11,734
Do you even know
what you're doing?

576
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,322
What if you get pregnant, Mia?

577
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,241
Is he willing to
take responsibility?

578
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,368
Answer me, Mia!

579
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,087
We love each other.
That's all that matters.

580
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,593
He was the only
one who stood by me

581
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,055
when I was having a hard
time completing my thesis.

582
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:46,895
Giro was the only one who gave me
strength when I felt like giving up!

583
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,232
My God, Mia.

584
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,821
You could have told
us about your situation.

585
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,244
How? Who would
even listen to me?

586
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,413
Sam's busy with his band!

587
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:08,750
And you?

588
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,796
You're always away
at prayer meetings.

589
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,131
I just miss you so much, Mom.

590
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,686
I've really missed this, Mom.

591
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,455
We're thinking of
moving in together.

592
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,419
So much for prayer meetings.

593
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,589
But it's true.

594
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,008
- Carol called earlier.
- And?

595
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,137
She told me the prayer meetings have
been on hold for six months already.

596
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,808
Can't you and Dad
patch things up?

597
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,101
Mia, please.

598
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,647
You know what he put me through.

599
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,899
He has a second family now.

600
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,444
I didn't tell you right away…

601
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,032
Because I didn't think
I'd fall for someone again.

602
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,159
Are you with a woman?

603
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,790
I'm with a man.

604
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,211
But he's much younger than me.

605
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,798
But he takes good care of me.

606
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,515
My friend, Ryan…

607
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:33,644
The thing is, I have friends
who go for older women.

608
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,439
It happens. How
young is young though?

609
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,698
Do you love him?

610
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,835
Niko's a great guy.

611
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,891
I just want you to be happy.

612
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,855
Does he have a job?

613
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,649
- Yes.
- Would he be open to living here?

614
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,819
I mean, I could go
jamming with him.

615
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,034
…If we don't live together.

616
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,454
You know your
dad won't like this.

617
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,426
I got your back, Mom.

618
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,185
What?

619
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,354
- You're doing it wrong.
- What?

620
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,731
Then show me.

621
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:02,274
Who taught you that?

622
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,525
Let me guess. Your grandma?

623
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,029
I'm getting these
out of the way.

624
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,199
Oh, you!

625
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:22,545
- Here we go.
- All right.

626
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,513
You're doing it wrong.

627
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:37,268
This is how Grandma taught me to make it.
You need to secure the ends tightly, okay?

628
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,812
See? There you go.

629
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,981
- Let me see.
- That's how you do it.

630
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,157
Hello, Mia.

631
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,496
Your Mom told me
that this is your favorite.

632
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,374
Here.

633
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,751
It's not poison, I swear.

634
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,295
All right.

635
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,882
- I hope you like it.
- It's pretty tender.

636
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,012
- It's good.
- Really?

637
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,764
Niko, come on.

638
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,768
Glory, this is
Nelson. My boyfriend.

639
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,937
Nice to meet you, Nelson.

640
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,314
I'm Glory.

641
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,401
Go join them.

642
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:28,653
Go on.

643
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,114
I feel so young!

644
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,370
I learned from
the best, of course!

645
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,914
Thanks, Glory.

646
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:47,964
You know what? I do
Kegel exercises every day.

647
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,511
Can we have two, please?

648
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,014
- Quiet.
- I have an announcement.

649
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:59,559
Niko has been
promoted to supervisor.

650
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,020
Nice one.

651
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,231
- You can go back next week.
- Thank you.

652
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,527
I'm like a grandma,

653
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,947
scrubbing your back.

654
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,493
You're the only granny who
can scrub my back like this.

655
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,995
Shut up.

656
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,831
You better, or else!

657
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,960
Can I have a hug?

658
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:30,215
Oh no! Hold on!

659
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,725
How long have you been there?

660
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,817
- You look hot.
- You're pretty hot too.

661
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:20,617
You're all sweaty.
But you still smell good.

662
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,121
- What's your secret?
- I won't tell you.

663
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,831
And why not?

664
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:29,334
You smell good.

665
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,089
Stay there.

666
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,511
Oh God!

667
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,906
This is my first time
doing this, okay?

668
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,281
You know what, G?

669
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,370
You're the best
girlfriend I've ever had.

670
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:56,169
Well, that's because I
do everything you say.

671
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,463
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

672
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,549
And you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

673
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,636
Okay, that's mean! I've
been nothing but nice to you!

674
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,097
But

675
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,352
you're the sweetest,

676
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,646
and

677
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,023
the most beautiful,

678
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,278
and the nicest.

679
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,907
And you always smell great.

680
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,161
You lucky man.

681
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,290
Aren't you glad you met me?

682
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,174
Now…

683
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,554
That look.

684
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,931
I love that about you.

685
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:53,352
Because that look you're
giving me right now?

686
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,731
That's how I know you
love me. I can feel it.

687
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,745
Why didn't you file
for an annulment?

688
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,293
It's expensive, and
Mike won't pay for it.

689
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,254
He says it's a waste of money.

690
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,516
I can help you with that.

691
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,566
How much would it cost?

692
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,736
Like,

693
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,658
how many lamps, cell phones,

694
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,034
or spare parts

695
01:03:51,035 --> 01:03:53,788
do I have to sell before I
can finally call you mine?

696
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,669
Do you want to get married?

697
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,421
Yes!

698
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,757
I want to marry you.

699
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,229
I love you so much, Niko.

700
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,940
More than you'll ever know.

701
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,364
But…

702
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,205
Can we put our wedding
plans off for now?

703
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:38,791
Just until we're
financially stable?

704
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,377
Niko.

705
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,548
Look at me.

706
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,049
Let's not rush into this.

707
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,053
I want to know if my
business is sustainable.

708
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:57,059
If my business looks like it will
do well for the foreseeable future,

709
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,438
we can save up for that.

710
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,820
I'm not going anywhere, Niko.

711
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,582
I'm really sorry.

712
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:23,669
The owner's brother is
thinking of closing the store.

713
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:26,756
Don't worry, we still have
two months' worth of salaries.

714
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,633
I can recommend you to a friend.

715
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,637
He works at an
insurance company. Well?

716
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,181
Personally, I think
you'd get the job.

717
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,517
Think about it, okay?

718
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,980
- Excuse me.
- Thanks, sir.

719
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,494
Long day at work?

720
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:10,715
I'm sorry, Mia.

721
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,051
Niko's visiting his family,
and I'm going with him.

722
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:16,304
- I'll make it up to you next week, okay?
- Why can't you spare a day for me?

723
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,766
He's with you six days a week!

724
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,935
Thank you, but you
didn't have to. Really.

725
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,729
I'm only visiting
family, anyway.

726
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,565
You're supposed to
be with the kids today.

727
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,777
I talked to Mia already.
You need me here.

728
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,114
I guess saving up
will have to wait.

729
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,950
It's not your fault. Things
happen, you know?

730
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,828
You don't have to worry
about that right now, okay?

731
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,455
- I'm always here for you.
- I still have two months.

732
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,332
I'm sure I'll think
of something.

733
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,919
I know you will.
I believe in you.

734
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:57,096
- How are you all doing?
- Pretty good.

735
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,809
- Niko!
- Hello.

736
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,311
- How have you been?
- Hello!

737
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,648
I missed you!

738
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,443
- This is Glory.
- Hi.

739
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,903
Where's Grandma?

740
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:15,823
- She's downstairs.
- All right, thanks.

741
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:19,076
How old is your aunt?

742
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,204
- Fifty, I think. Why?
- Oh God…

743
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,165
I shouldn't have taken
her hand in greeting!

744
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,000
We're the same age!

745
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,462
It's fine, Glory. You look
much younger, anyway.

746
01:07:37,928 --> 01:07:38,929
Grandma!

747
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,225
How are you?

748
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,772
You weren't here
for Bok's birthday.

749
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,816
I was too tired
from work, I'm sorry.

750
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,652
Wait, I'll introduce
you to my girlfriend.

751
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,827
- Hello.
- G…

752
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,038
This my grandma.

753
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,248
She's the one who raised me.

754
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,587
Every single thing you like about
me is all thanks to Grandma.

755
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,925
Your father wants
to see you, Niko.

756
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,929
I'll be back in a bit, Grandma.

757
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,188
What are you doing, Grandma?

758
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,064
This?

759
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,567
I'm sorting threads

760
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,530
so that tomorrow I
can start weaving.

761
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:41,742
Dear,

762
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,745
we don't have much.

763
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:50,917
The only wealth we have is our family,
the ties that bind us together.

764
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:54,004
I hope you treasure
family as much as we do.

765
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:55,922
Grandma.

766
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,800
I'll be visiting Dad, okay?

767
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,136
They just got
back from the field.

768
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,429
He's a bit upset that
I went straight here.

769
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,473
Sure, go ahead.

770
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,184
- We'll be back in a bit.
- All right.

771
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:10,728
- Come on, G.
- Have you had pinikpikan before?

772
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,231
They slaughtered a chicken,
so we're having that now.

773
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,483
I've had that dish
before in Baguio…

774
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,986
How long have you been together?

775
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,654
More than a couple
of months already.

776
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,322
Glory is special to me.

777
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,783
You'll get used to
things here in no time.

778
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,827
It's really nice
here, very quiet.

779
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:27,830
In these parts, young
people obey their elders.

780
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,665
You hear that, G? Over
here, we obey our elders.

781
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,041
But this one right here, oh!

782
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:35,044
Grandma always scolds him
because he drinks too much.

783
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:37,256
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

784
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,563
How do you like it here?

785
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,815
It's nice.

786
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,572
I need to tell you something.

787
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:32,436
No PDA allowed here, okay?

788
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:34,730
Why?

789
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,609
Well, it's not
exactly forbidden, but

790
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,569
they don't approve of it either.

791
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,821
Why?

792
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:47,576
Why, why, why.

793
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,831
We'll talk about it later.

794
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,378
Excuse me.

795
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,548
You drank too much.

796
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,927
Try some pinikpikan.

797
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,389
- My husband made that.
- It's good.

798
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,896
How did your husband court you?

799
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:19,650
He didn't. It was
love at first sight.

800
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,652
Thank you.

801
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:26,239
How about you? Have
you experienced that?

802
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,118
It's time you do!

803
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:39,585
Your husband's a great cook.
No wonder you fell for him.

804
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:42,965
Yes, he is. He's a
skilled farmer too.

805
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:47,302
More importantly, he also helps out
with the household chores. And...

806
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,928
If you ask me,

807
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:53,057
I think it's better to have a family
with someone from our community.

808
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,601
But if that's not possible,

809
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,896
just make sure you
raise your family well,

810
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:01,232
and keep our traditions alive.

811
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,943
Now, dear,

812
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:06,988
I hope you can give
me plenty of grandkids.

813
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,281
Will you?

814
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:11,952
I don't think you're that
much older than Niko.

815
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,620
You should start planning now.

816
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,249
I can't wait to have
grandchildren too.

817
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,376
How many grandkids
do you want, Mom?

818
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:22,086
- Four!
- Excuse me.

819
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:23,963
- More?
- No, thank you.

820
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:24,964
Yes.

821
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:26,758
Excuse me, sorry.

822
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,885
You won't be able to make it.

823
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:30,553
She's overwhelmed.

824
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:31,722
Right?

825
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,268
You're sleeping in this room.

826
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,325
Are you mad at me, G?

827
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,454
Did I do something wrong?

828
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,795
I was up all night
chasing mosquitoes away.

829
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,882
- I was knocking on the window. Why didn...
- I didn't want to.

830
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:11,637
I know you're crazy about me.

831
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,725
Especially not in
front of your family.

832
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,560
No one would have known.

833
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,437
I would have.

834
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,482
I'm a mother, too, okay?

835
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,029
It won't happen again.

836
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,252
I'm getting off here.

837
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:07,901
God…

838
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,487
- You scared me!
- That's enough.

839
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,369
Why are you here?

840
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,870
Why do you think?

841
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,009
I know we had a
misunderstanding,

842
01:14:32,509 --> 01:14:34,219
but you shouldn't have left me!

843
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,601
I said I was sorry, okay?

844
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,896
I waited for you at home!

845
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,401
"If you leave, make sure you come
back." That's what Grandma taught me!

846
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,323
You forgot about
that, obviously.

847
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,911
I was worried sick about you, G!

848
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,748
I couldn't even sleep!

849
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,709
So I came here.

850
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,091
- Why did you...
- Because I can't face you right now, Niko!

851
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,635
We can make love all we want,

852
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:19,515
but that will not change the
fact that I can't have a child!

853
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:26,855
We can't have a child.
Do you understand?

854
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,406
I'm fine with that.

855
01:15:39,117 --> 01:15:43,163
I knew that from the
moment we got together.

856
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,379
I will always love you.

857
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,673
Child or no child.

858
01:15:56,176 --> 01:15:57,386
Come home, please...

859
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,566
How about we adopt a kid, G?

860
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,694
My uncle was infertile, so
he and his wife adopted a kid.

861
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,572
It turned out well
for them in the end.

862
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:18,532
We'll see.

863
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:23,286
How about we adopt a
boy? A little Niko, if you will.

864
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:25,621
Let's call him Baldemor.

865
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:27,748
Baldemor? That's pretty unusual.

866
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,501
Right? It's the name
of one of our ancestors.

867
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:33,213
I see. Okay,
let's call him that.

868
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:41,967
Mom!

869
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:55,981
Hey, bro. Sorry about
this. Is Mom up yet?

870
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:00,736
Mia eloped with her boyfriend.

871
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:13,248
I'll take responsibility
for our kid.

872
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:19,003
My uncle told my Mom
about this, actually.

873
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:21,213
He told me Mom's coming
back home for the wedding.

874
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:25,468
We're planning to get
married in three months.

875
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,970
A simple wedding will be fine.

876
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:29,765
Mia?

877
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:31,808
What now?

878
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,936
Giro and I have
talked about this.

879
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:40,609
We're thinking of living together
at his place in the interim.

880
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:43,278
By the way, what did Dad say?

881
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:47,657
He'll be back by the end of the
month. He will talk to you then.

882
01:19:54,706 --> 01:19:57,583
I'll get our stuff
ready. Excuse me.

883
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,584
Go on.

884
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:07,719
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Are you Mia's brother?

885
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,430
No, sir.

886
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,728
- I'll go help Mia.
- All right.

887
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:28,824
Do you love him?

888
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,833
I can't imagine
life without him.

889
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,470
Now,

890
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,684
you'll be the one making
your own decisions.

891
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,603
But can I just
ask for one thing?

892
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,899
Can you wait until
your father comes back?

893
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,569
Can you please
talk to him first?

894
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,073
I'll tell Giro.

895
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,419
Things happened so fast.

896
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,047
You'll be getting
married in three months.

897
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,301
And a few months after that,

898
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,512
you'll be a mother.

899
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:46,943
It's just so soon, Mia.

900
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:49,696
I wish you had taken your time.

901
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,158
But no matter what happens…

902
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:58,663
I will always be
here for you, Mia.

903
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,630
I'm your mother, and I love you.

904
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:10,842
I love you very much.

905
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:41,581
Hey there, handsome.

906
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,210
How was the wedding?

907
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,295
It was so romantic.

908
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:53,759
Even with the simple ceremony, I was
in tears. I've never felt so old.

909
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,429
- You'll be a grandma soon, that's why.
- Come off it, Niko!

910
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:00,225
Come here, my
beautiful, sexy grandma.

911
01:23:00,892 --> 01:23:01,892
Man, you're heavy.

912
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,648
What are you thinking now?

913
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,567
Oh! I needed that.

914
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:11,778
That feels good.

915
01:23:13,863 --> 01:23:15,448
Mike was there, right?

916
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,493
Yeah.

917
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,956
We sat next to each other.

918
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:25,291
We were pretty civil.

919
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,169
He didn't nag me or anything.

920
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:34,633
As long as Mike is around,

921
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,594
I can never truly
be part of your life.

922
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,527
Can we go back to my hometown?

923
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,572
What?

924
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:58,658
Mia has just got married.

925
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:01,619
Joey has a girlfriend.

926
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:03,705
Sam's married too.

927
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,127
Maybe life would be
better for us back home.

928
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:15,216
At least until I find a new job.

929
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,512
What is this really about, Niko?

930
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,224
I feel that I can be a
better husband back home.

931
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,061
Living here is expensive.

932
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:30,482
But my business is doing well.

933
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:35,611
My pottery shop just got a
lot of pre-orders. For my pots...

934
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:36,696
See? This is what I mean.

935
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,492
You've shouldered
everything this month.

936
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:43,745
I'm not okay with that, G.

937
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,370
Not at all.

938
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:54,255
I've made my decision.

939
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:56,966
Are you coming with me?

940
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:00,178
Do you just go along
with everything Niko says?

941
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,305
You're a married man.

942
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:07,227
Can you imagine life
without your wife by our side?

943
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,689
It's a small community,
but it's nice out here.

944
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,441
What's that?

945
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:20,323
Over here, everyone is family.

946
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:24,244
We're all involved
in each other's lives.

947
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:26,913
You can't hide anything here.

948
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,082
Like they say…

949
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:34,879
Here's your order.

950
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:39,551
And everyone is always
ready to lend a helping hand.

951
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:41,760
Auntie!

952
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:43,805
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

953
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:52,772
But that also means everyone
has an opinion about you.

954
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,441
Come on.

955
01:25:56,609 --> 01:26:00,112
Now, that shouldn't stop
you from living your life.

956
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,114
You think so?

957
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,408
- I'll go get a coffee.
- All right.

958
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,409
Thanks.

959
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:08,913
Niko's been drinking all day.

960
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,625
Sorry about last night, G.

961
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,421
You drink a lot, Niko.
And I don't like it.

962
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:18,965
You were binge drinking.

963
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:24,220
Did you think I wouldn't
find out about it?

964
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,272
Is something wrong, Niko?

965
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,445
Maybe it's because…

966
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:44,740
Ever since we moved here,

967
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,035
all we've done is work.

968
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,749
We barely have any
time for each other, Glory.

969
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:57,045
We're together every day,
but we're always working.

970
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,216
Isn't that what you
wanted for both of us?

971
01:27:03,426 --> 01:27:05,261
I agreed to this.

972
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,014
I adjusted for your sake.

973
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:11,683
- That was the plan, right?
- The plan was to save.

974
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:13,228
So that we can
finally be together.

975
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:15,604
G, tell me.

976
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,483
Are you still happy with me?

977
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:21,944
Niko!

978
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:24,321
- Someone's here to visit Glory.
- Who is it?

979
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,490
The neighbor thought
it was her boyfriend.

980
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:29,369
- Niko, he asked me… You know him?
- Sam!

981
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,205
He's Glory's son.

982
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:36,167
Your son was here earlier?

983
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,337
I didn't know you had a child.

984
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:43,215
I have three kids.

985
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:45,592
I hope you don't mind me asking,

986
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:46,803
but how old are you?

987
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,721
Grandma.

988
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:50,973
I don't think it...

989
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,349
It's not that!

990
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:55,979
I welcomed you into our family.

991
01:27:56,771 --> 01:28:00,023
Now, I will never
dictate Niko's happiness.

992
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:04,612
But for you to hide the
fact that you have a son?

993
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,532
That you have a husband?

994
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:11,911
You should have
told me the truth!

995
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:14,789
Grandma,

996
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:18,333
I already told Mom and Dad.

997
01:28:18,334 --> 01:28:21,587
Glory should've
told me this herself!

998
01:28:23,214 --> 01:28:25,091
You chose to be here.

999
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,467
So, you should give us

1000
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,804
the same respect
that we give you.

1001
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,641
Why did you hide this from me?

1002
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:37,895
I love Niko.

1003
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,235
I don't want to lose him.

1004
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:50,616
I know that

1005
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:54,329
others do not approve
of our relationship.

1006
01:28:56,539 --> 01:29:01,168
But I'm hoping that we can prove to
them just how much we love each other.

1007
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:02,711
It just happened.

1008
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,672
I didn't choose to
love him. I just do.

1009
01:29:09,218 --> 01:29:10,928
But what he made me feel…

1010
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,558
I've never felt that
way about anyone else.

1011
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:24,067
My husband used to beat me up.

1012
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:29,739
He cheated on me. He
hid that fact for nine years.

1013
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:35,370
Choosing to rebuild our marriage

1014
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,332
was one of the worst
decisions I ever made.

1015
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,046
Back then, I thought.

1016
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:47,799
I had nothing else to live for.

1017
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:53,763
But when Niko came into my life…

1018
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,268
Suddenly, I found
a reason to live.

1019
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,154
I know that nothing in
this world will last forever.

1020
01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:16,119
Niko and I may
not end up together.

1021
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:21,874
And I might not get
to grow old with him.

1022
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:27,338
But I don't want to
live a life of regret.

1023
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,050
That's why I chose
him, to be with him.

1024
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:38,057
I've never felt as alive
since meeting him.

1025
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:41,227
Am I wrong for
wanting to be happy?

1026
01:30:41,811 --> 01:30:43,311
Are you sure

1027
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:46,190
your husband won't
come after my grandson?

1028
01:30:47,525 --> 01:30:49,110
He won't. I'll make sure of it.

1029
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:56,826
I raised Nikolas.

1030
01:30:57,535 --> 01:31:01,914
Even when he was young, I knew he would
grow up to be a very bright young man.

1031
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:08,254
Maybe that's why
Nikolas chose you.

1032
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:13,176
Maybe that's why he
admires you so much.

1033
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:16,053
Even back then,

1034
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:20,016
I wanted him to be a good father

1035
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:22,602
and carry on our traditions.

1036
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:26,230
I wanted him to be with a woman

1037
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:30,109
who could give him a family.

1038
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:32,612
I just have one thing
to ask of you, Glory.

1039
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:36,615
If you truly love him,

1040
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:41,162
then you will let him become
the man he is meant to be!

1041
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:43,623
You've lived a
long life already.

1042
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:46,834
You already found
your place in this world.

1043
01:31:49,378 --> 01:31:51,963
You are a mother
yourself, Glory.

1044
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:54,300
Your children need you
more than Nikolas does!

1045
01:32:20,826 --> 01:32:21,953
What happened?

1046
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:26,541
You left without a word.

1047
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:37,218
I felt dizzy, that's all.

1048
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,804
You and Grandma fought.

1049
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:43,974
Let's go home, Niko.

1050
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:46,184
Let's go home, please.

1051
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:48,061
Go home where?

1052
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:51,273
- Back home, or back to Baguio?
- Anywhere but here!

1053
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,109
Niko, please…

1054
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,736
Anywhere but here.

1055
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,239
Did they say anything?

1056
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:02,409
You should have
just ignored them!

1057
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,411
I can't do that!

1058
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,497
They will never change
their minds about us!

1059
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:17,049
You have to be strong,
Glory. For the both of us.

1060
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,972
Why we're leaving,
why it came to this…

1061
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,351
I just don't want to explain
things to Grandma anymore.

1062
01:33:39,905 --> 01:33:42,908
We cannot make people
change their minds about us.

1063
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,087
Should we keep letting what other
people say about us control our lives?

1064
01:33:57,590 --> 01:33:59,884
I'm sick of hearing
what they think of us too!

1065
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,512
But at least I have family here!

1066
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:15,441
You will never go against
your grandma's wishes.

1067
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:17,275
I know that.

1068
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:18,444
Glory, please.

1069
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:23,282
Grandma is the oldest
member of our clan.

1070
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:27,787
And we should keep
our traditions alive.

1071
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,435
I'm worried about her, Grandma.

1072
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,611
She hasn't responded to
any of my calls and texts.

1073
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:33,157
Niko,

1074
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:36,201
she's a grown woman.

1075
01:38:39,538 --> 01:38:41,665
She can take care of herself.

1076
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:43,667
Okay?

1077
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:08,984
You have your whole
life ahead of you.

1078
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:13,030
Those who leave…

1079
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,992
Must make sure
they come back home.

1080
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,793
If she truly loves you,

1081
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:29,046
she will come back.

1082
01:40:22,933 --> 01:40:26,937
Wow! Glory, congratulations!

1083
01:40:31,567 --> 01:40:33,484
Come here!

1084
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:35,862
Wow, you look so much alike!

1085
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:38,323
Doesn't he?

1086
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,929
Hey! Sam is here!

1087
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,931
Sam!

1088
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:08,020
Here they are! Hello. Mom!

1089
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,439
Hello, Sam!

1090
01:41:11,106 --> 01:41:13,357
I've missed you, bro!

1091
01:41:13,358 --> 01:41:16,070
- Make a silly face!
- A silly face now?

1092
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:21,116
Glory!

1093
01:41:25,537 --> 01:41:27,039
Look at this!

1094
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:29,750
Isn't it nice?

1095
01:41:34,671 --> 01:41:37,132
You forgot the bag, Sam!

1096
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:50,770
Where's...

1097
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,734
Lito, can you
help him with that?

1098
01:41:56,735 --> 01:41:57,861
Be careful.

1099
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:16,796
Come on.

1100
01:42:23,929 --> 01:42:25,139
That's it!

1101
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:26,849
Come here, little one.
