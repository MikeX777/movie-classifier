SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY
DISTRAUGHT.

WHOSE FAULT WAS IT?
YOURS OR HIS?

180
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:29,200
FRANKIE, PLEASE!

181
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,658
EXCELLENT.

182
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:38,075
YOU’RE GONNA
LOVE THOSE.

183
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:40,117
GET CHANGED INTO
YOUR NEXT OUTFIT

184
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:42,075
AND I’LL GET US
SOME WATER.

185
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:45,075
NICE.

186
00:21:45,075 --> 00:21:47,367
CARRY ON.

187
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:54,075
WHERE DID YOU DO IT?

188
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:59,075
THAT’S IT. DON’T LAUGH.
BE SERIOUS.

189
00:21:59,075 --> 00:22:01,492
SCARY.

190
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:03,033
NO!

191
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,658
CARRY ON.

192
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,533
NICE.

193
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,992
BIT MORE OF THE VIXEN.

194
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:17,408
VIXEN?
VIXEN.

195
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:19,075
LOVELY.

196
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:40,325
DON’T YOU THINK
THEY’RE BEAUTIFUL?

197
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,700
THE DAFFODILS.

198
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,533
NEW LIFE.

199
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:57,075
NICE. CARRY ON.

200
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,908
AS IF YOU WISH
SOMEONE WERE KISSING YOU.

201
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:24,658
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

202
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:29,492
ON THE BED.

203
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:33,533
GOOD.

204
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:41,200
AND-- TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

205
00:23:42,908 --> 00:23:43,950
WHAT?

206
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,367
TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF.

207
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,950
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?

208
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,533
IT’S JUST-- I’VE NEVER
DONE TOPLESS BEFORE.

209
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:57,575
IT’S NOT REALLY
GOING TO BE TOPLESS.

210
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:01,658
TRUST ME.

211
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,242
MMM-HMM. RIGHT.

212
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:09,825
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

213
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:12,367
IF THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

214
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,950
TO MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE,

215
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,200
THEN SO BE IT.

216
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,825
[MAIA] I’M NOT ENTIRELY
SURE THAT IT WILL.

217
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,408
THIS IS THE HUMAN BODY!

218
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:25,867
THIS IS MY HUMAN BODY.

219
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,408
YOU MAY NOT FIND IT
ON A MAGAZINE,

220
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:33,408
BUT IT’S MINE,
AND IT’S ALL I HAVE.

221
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:38,117
AND IN THIS WORLD,
IF SOMEBODY LIKE ME ISN’T SHY,

222
00:24:38,117 --> 00:24:41,075
THEN SOMEBODY LIKE YOU
REALLY SHOULDN’T BE.

223
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,825
[FRANCESCA] I SEE VULNERABLE.

224
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,492
I SEE A REAL WOMAN.

225
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:06,492
I SEE YOU.

226
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:18,950
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT NOW?

227
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:26,408
ADRIAN, WHEN YOU
FIRST CAME HERE,

228
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,700
I ASKED YOU FOR YOUR
EARLIEST HAPPY MEMORY.

229
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,075
YOU SAID IT WAS WHEN
YOU MET YOUR PARTNER.

230
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:35,075
TODAY, YOUR HAPPY MEMORY
IS YEARS EARLIER,

231
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,283
WHEN YOU PASSED
YOUR DRIVING TEST.

232
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:44,533
ALREADY, YOUR MIND HAS
CHANGED. YOU’VE CHANGED.

233
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:49,700
NOTHING IS PRE-DESTINED.

234
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,408
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BE
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE.

235
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,992
NOW, IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE
A WORD TO DESCRIBE HOW YOU FEEL,

236
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:06,117
NOT NECESSARILY RIGHT NOW,

237
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:10,242
BUT GENERALLY, RECENTLY,

238
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,700
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

239
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:17,533
ISOLATION.

240
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,992
GO ON.

241
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:37,075
QUITE OFTEN. VERY OFTEN,

242
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,825
I DON’T WANT IT TO BE, BUT--

243
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:49,950
AT TIMES I FEEL THAT
SECLUSION IS THE BEST
THING FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

244
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:55,867
I TRY SO HARD WITH
THE THE DAY-TO-DAY THINGS.

245
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,033
I GO TO WORK.
I COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE,

246
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:04,533
I EVEN FORCE A SMILE
IF I HAVE TO.

247
00:27:06,117 --> 00:27:09,117
BUT EVEN THEN,

248
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,992
I’M NOT THERE. NOT REALLY.

249
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:19,283
SO WHY DO YOU DO IT?

250
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:22,825
GO THROUGH
THE MOTIONS, I MEAN.

251
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:25,700
WELL, WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

252
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:35,158
ADRIAN, WHAT IS IT THAT YOU
FEEL THAT YOU’RE MISSING?

253
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,408
LOVE.

254
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:45,158
LOVE?

255
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:50,533
WHAT DOES LOVE
MEAN TO YOU?

256
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:54,325
I THINK ABOUT THE WOMAN
I LOVE.

257
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,408
TA-DA.

258
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:26,283
OOH. THANKS.

259
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:29,742
YOU KNOW, I CAN’T
BELIEVE THAT IN A DAY

260
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,325
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

261
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:34,992
IT’S LIKE I CAN REALLY
BREATHE HERE.

262
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:37,283
CHEERS. CHEERS.

263
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:44,450
LISTEN. I’M NOT DOING
ANYTHING THIS WEEKEND.

264
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,825
WHY DON’T YOU STAY AND
I CAN SHOW YOU THE COASTLINE?

265
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:50,533
IT’S REALLY STUNNING.

266
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,325
SORRY.

267
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,158
NO. IT’S NOT THAT.
I’D LOVE TO STAY.

268
00:28:55,158 --> 00:28:58,117
IT’S JUST, MY HUSBAND
AND I HAVE PLANS THIS--

269
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,242
WELL, LOOK,
THE OFFER’S THERE.

270
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:02,158
I’M JUST GOING TO
RELAX,

271
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,450
GET SOME FRESH AIR,

272
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,158
AND IT WOULD BE
REALLY LOVELY HAVING
YOU YOU.

273
00:29:07,158 --> 00:29:08,908
THAT’S ALL.

274
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:39,700
HI, HONEY. UM, NO.

275
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,742
UMM, NO, ACTUALLY.

276
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:43,533
I-- THAT’S WHAT
I WAS CALLING FOR.

277
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:45,200
I JUST WANTED TO
SPEAK TO YOU.

278
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,992
UM--

279
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:48,867
IT’S ABSOLUTELY
BEAUTIFUL HERE

280
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,992
AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER THAT
I’VE BEEN WORKING WITH

281
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,450
ASKED IF I WANTED TO STAY
FOR THE WEEKEND, AND I SAID--

282
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,200
NO. I SAID YES, BECAUSE--

283
00:30:06,992 --> 00:30:09,533
IF YOU COULD
JUST SEE IT HERE,

284
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:12,200
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL, AND--

285
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:18,992
OH, MY GOD. I’M NOT--

286
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:21,200
I’M NOT COMING HOME TONIGHT.

287
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,033
I’M STAYING FOR THE WEEKEND.

288
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:28,158
IT’S NOT ABOUT
THE SHOOT ANYMORE.

289
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:30,325
I JUST WANT TO STAY
FOR THE WEEKEND.

290
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:32,450
I’M GOING TO STAY.

291
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,033
IT’S ABOUT ME
NEEDING THE SPACE!

292
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:44,867
I’M STAYING AND
I’LL SEE YOU ON SUNDAY.

293
00:30:58,158 --> 00:31:00,408
[LAUGHING]

294
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,617
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD?

295
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:05,867
NO, IT’S LOVELY,
THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH!

296
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:09,325
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE
WORKED UP AN APPETITE.

297
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:13,325
OH, TREAT YOURSELF.

298
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:16,158
I SUPPOSE YOU’RE RIGHT.

299
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:19,117
YOU KNOW, I’VE HAD SUCH
A GOOD DAY. THANK YOU,
FRANKIE.

300
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:23,867
DON’T BE SILLY.
YOU WERE FANTASTIC.

301
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,325
THAT WASN’T ME.

302
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:27,575
I’VE NEVER BEEN DIRECTED
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

303
00:31:27,575 --> 00:31:30,575
BARBARA DIDN’T WARN ME
YOU WERE QUITE SO--

304
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:31,700
DIRECT.

305
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,992
THAT’S AS GOOD A WORD
AS ANY.

306
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,575
I ALWAYS TELL HER NOT TO.

307
00:31:36,575 --> 00:31:39,700
THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE
IS CRUCIAL TO MY WORK.

308
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,408
I WAS DEFINITELY SURPRISED.

309
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,408
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE BOTH
ENDED UP HALF NAKED.

310
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:44,867
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

311
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:47,450
[BOTH LAUGHING]

312
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,575
I DID.

313
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,033
LET ME SEE THE PHOTOS?

314
00:31:54,408 --> 00:31:56,700
I NEVER SHOW MY WORK
UNTIL IT’S READY.

315
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:05,450
I’M GOING TO GET ANOTHER
BOTTLE OF WINE,

316
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,200
AND YOU GO INTO
THE DRAWING ROOM AND
MAKE YOURSELF COZY.

317
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,075
DRAWING ROOM?

318
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:12,617
WHAT?

319
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,200
I THOUGHT I JUST
SAW SOMETHING OUTSIDE.

320
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:25,742
MAYBE IT WAS A CRAZED FARMER.

321
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,158
WHAT CRAZED FARMER?

322
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:33,075
YOU KNOW PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY
USED TO LIVE HERE?

323
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:35,325
THE POET?

324
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:36,908
YOU KNOW HIM?

325
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:39,158
BY NAME.

326
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:44,908
WELL, YOU KNOW HE WAS
THE HUSBAND OF MARY SHELLEY?

327
00:33:44,908 --> 00:33:48,908
AS IN, THE CREATOR
OF "FRANKENSTEIN"?

328
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:52,325
THE VERY SAME.

329
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:54,492
AND THIS IS THE VERY SAME HOUSE

330
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:59,158
WHERE THE STORY OF
"FRANKENSTEIN"
WAS CONCEIVED.

331
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:03,950
AND YOU DECIDE TO TELL ME
THIS STORY NOW?

332
00:34:05,492 --> 00:34:08,908
ONE NIGHT, A CRAZED FARMER
WITH A SHOTGUN

333
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:13,742
CAME TO THE HOUSE AND
SHOT AT PERCY THREE TIMES.

334
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:15,908
REALLY?

335
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:17,950
WHY?

336
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:21,033
NOBODY KNOWS,

337
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:24,325
AND THAT’S PRECISELY
WHAT LED MARY SHELLEY

338
00:34:24,325 --> 00:34:26,908
TO WONDER THE SAME THING.

339
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:32,033
WHAT MOTIVATES A MONSTER
TO DO SUCH THINGS?

340
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:39,033
ALAS, THE IDEA
OF FRANKENSTEIN WAS BORN.

341
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,033
HERE?

342
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:47,158
RIGHT THROUGH THAT WINDOW.

343
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,950
SO, DID IT KILL HIM?

344
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:04,075
NO. HE DROWNED IN ITALY.

345
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,908
NOT THE LUCKIEST MAN
TO HAVE LIVED, WAS HE?

346
00:35:19,658 --> 00:35:22,325
DESCRIBE HER TO ME.

347
00:35:22,325 --> 00:35:24,617
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

348
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:27,325
WELL, DO YOU FIND HER
ATTRACTIVE?

349
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:31,450
OF COURSE. IF ANYTHING,
SHE’S TOO ATTRACTIVE.

350
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,867
TOO ATTRACTIVE?

351
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:35,658
YEAH.

352
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:36,742
HOW SO?

353
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,492
SOMETIMES SHE GETS LOOKS

354
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:48,658
AND REMARKS OFF SCUMBAG
STRANGERS.

355
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:53,492
PEOPLE HAVE EVEN COME ON
TO HER IN FRONT OF ME.

356
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:54,825
AND DOES THAT
MAKE YOU ANGRY?

357
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:57,325
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK?

358
00:35:57,325 --> 00:36:00,200
IT’S JUST SO GODDAMN
FUCKING RUDE

359
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,742
AND PEOPLE SHOULD
HAVE MORE RESPECT!

360
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:04,242
CALM DOWN.

361
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,367
DO YOU TRUST HER?

362
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:58,492
I DON’T TRUST ANYONE.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

364
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:03,325
JUST A MINUTE.

365
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:08,492
COME IN.

366
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:11,908
JUST CHECKING
EVERYTHING’S ALL RIGHT.

367
00:37:11,908 --> 00:37:15,325
EVERYTHING’S
PERFECT, FRANKIE.
THANK YOU.

368
00:37:16,658 --> 00:37:18,075
RIGHT.

369
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:21,367
WELL, I’M JUST DOWN
THE HALL IF YOU WANT
ANYTHING.

370
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:22,950
OKAY.

371
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,533
GIVE ME A SHOUT
IF YOU NEED ME.

372
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,033
WILL DO.

373
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:45,658
SHE’S SO INDEPENDENT,

374
00:37:47,408 --> 00:37:50,825
AND ALTHOUGH THAT’S
ONE OF THE THINGS
I LOVE ABOUT HER,

375
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:53,200
I ALSO HATE IT.

376
00:37:56,617 --> 00:38:00,075
THERE ARE MOMENTS

377
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:03,908
WHEN I WANT HER TO NEED ME.

378
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,242
WHAT, YOU NEED TO FEEL VALUED?

379
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:11,242
YOU WANT ATTENTION
AND AFFECTION?

380
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:12,950
YES.

381
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,325
WELL, THAT’S LIKE ANYBODY.
THAT’S NOT UNCOMMON.

382
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,492
IT’S NOT?

383
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:19,033
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

384
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:20,950
IT’S PERFECTLY NATURAL.

385
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:32,033
SOMETIMES I JUST WATCH HER.

386
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:35,658
AND TO LOOK AT HER
WHEN SHE DOESN’T KNOW,

387
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,950
I CAN REALLY SEE
HER VULNERABILITY.

388

[KNOCK ON DOOR]

389
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:16,367
FRANKIE?

390
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:19,950
FRANKIE, IS THAT YOU?

391
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:44,658
THEY’RE THE MOMENTS
I ENJOY THE MOST.

392
00:39:44,658 --> 00:39:48,367
I’M NOT SURE
OF YOUR MEANING.

393
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,367
WHAT MEANING?

394
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:54,992
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU’VE NEVER
LOOKED OR WATCHED

395
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,950
A LOVED ONE
WHEN THEY’RE BUSY

396
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,075
OR WHEN THEY’RE ASLEEP?

397
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:08,200
IT’S SO PEACEFUL.

398
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,242
AND IN THESE MOMENTS,

399
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:14,367
THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW

400
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:17,658
THEY’RE YOUR WHOLE WORLD.

401
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,950
I’M GOING TO BREAK
ONE OF MY RULES.

402
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,867
OKAY.

403
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:57,700
SERIOUSLY?

404
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,242
I THINK YOU NEED
TO SEE SOME OF THESE.

405
00:41:59,242 --> 00:42:00,117
OOH!

406
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,867
ONLY A FEW, MIND.

407
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,242
OKAY.

408
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:05,950
CLICK LEFT TO SCROLL.

409
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,283
MMM-HMM.

410
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:14,992
WHAT IS THIS?

411
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:18,658
IT’S YOU AND A LITTLE GIRL
CALLED CHLOE.

412
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:21,158
DON’T SAY THAT NAME.

413
00:42:25,117 --> 00:42:26,658
WHO’S CHLOE?

414
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:28,283
I SAID DON’T!

415
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:30,700
YOU DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT
TO DO THIS!

416
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,450
I’M SORRY, MAIA.

417
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:38,992
IT’S JUST I’VE NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

418
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:40,992
I DIDN’T MEAN TO HURT YOU.

419
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:45,117
I JUST SAW SUCH BEAUTY
IN THAT MOMENT.

420
00:42:48,408 --> 00:42:51,742
ANYWAY, IT’S YOUR
PRIVATE BUSINESS,

421
00:42:51,742 --> 00:42:53,117
SO YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT

422
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:54,700
IF YOU DON’T WANT TO.

423
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:59,700
I PROMISED TO
SHOW YOU AROUND.

424
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,367
IT’S REALLY PEACEFUL HERE.

425
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,533
IT COULD BE JUST WHAT YOU NEED.

426
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:28,408
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I CAME OUT HERE.

427
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:32,283
I WAS ABSOLUTELY PETRIFIED.

428
00:43:32,283 --> 00:43:35,117
THE BOAT ROCKS SO BLOODY MUCH,
DOESN’T IT?

429
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,950
I’M TAKING YOU TO
A REALLY SECLUDED BEACH.

430
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,992
IT’S SO QUIET.

431
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:49,742
I COULD GO AND COME BACK
WITHOUT SEEING ANYBODY.

432
00:43:49,742 --> 00:43:53,825
ONE OR TWO PEOPLE--
THAT IS A BUSY DAY.

433
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:59,117
IT’S THE CLOSEST THING WE’VE
GOT ROUND HERE TO PARADISE.

434
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:04,700
FREEZING, ISN’T IT?

435
00:44:12,408 --> 00:44:16,992
[MAIA] ISN’T IT STRANGE
HOW SOMETIMES YOU
CAN FORGET TO FEEL?

436
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:22,825
WE TRIED SO HARD,
MY HUSBAND AND I.

437
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:29,117
FOR YEARS WE DID
EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK.

438
00:44:31,575 --> 00:44:33,742
WE WERE DESPERATE
TO START A FAMILY,

439
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:39,117
AND THE DAY I FELT PREGNANT,
I KNEW. I JUST KNEW.

440
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:45,033
AND THE TEST
CAME BACK POSITIVE,

441
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:48,742
OH, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE.

442
00:44:48,742 --> 00:44:53,700
HE PICKED ME UP IN HIS ARMS
AND WE MADE LOVE FOR HOURS.

443
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,158
I’D NEVER KNOWN HIM
TO BE SO TENDER.

444
00:44:58,742 --> 00:45:01,867
HE INSISTED WE GO OUT
FOR DINNER TO CELEBRATE

445
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:06,283
AND ANNOUNCED THE PREGNANCY
TO THE WHOLE RESTAURANT,

446
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:10,158
AND THEY CHEERED
AND CONGRATULATED US.

447
00:45:11,617 --> 00:45:14,575
IT WAS SURREAL,

448
00:45:14,575 --> 00:45:15,867
TO FEEL SO IMPORTANT,

449
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:20,575
LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF A MOVIE.

450
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,450
IT WAS THE BEST
NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

451
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:33,158
HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW?

452
00:45:34,575 --> 00:45:36,158
IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE
ONE WORD,

453
00:45:36,158 --> 00:45:39,033
ONE OVERRIDING EMOTION,
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

454
00:45:40,575 --> 00:45:43,033
LOSS.

455
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:45,533
UNBEARABLE LOSS.

456
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,575
WE’VE LOST QUITE A LOT.

457
00:45:55,825 --> 00:45:58,325
WE’VE LOST OUR WORLD,

458
00:45:58,325 --> 00:46:02,158
AND I’M SO DESPERATELY
TRYING TO GET IT BACK.

459
00:46:04,158 --> 00:46:06,908
I’VE JUST NO IDEA WHAT TO DO,

460
00:46:06,908 --> 00:46:08,867
AND EVERYTHING I DO DO

461
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,408
JUST PUSHES HER FURTHER AWAY,

462
00:46:15,158 --> 00:46:17,450
AND I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

463
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,617
WHEN I ASKED YOU ABOUT YOUR
HAPPIEST MEMORY TOGETHER,

464
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:26,867
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID?

465
00:46:28,325 --> 00:46:30,617
YES.

466
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:34,325
I SPOKE ABOUT
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

467
00:46:34,325 --> 00:46:38,575
IT WAS SO NATURAL,
SO EXCITING.

468
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:41,617
THE FIRST TOUCH.
OUR FIRST KISS.

469
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:50,325
MY STOMACH WAS IN KNOTS,

470
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:55,158
BUT THEN WHEN I FELT
HER HEART BEAT SO WILDLY,

471
00:46:55,158 --> 00:46:58,575
I KNEW SHE FELT THE SAME AND--

472
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:01,450
I KNEW EVERYTHING
WOULD BE OKAY.

473
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:10,200
EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL
MY BODY STARTED TO CHANGE.

474
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,867
I PANICKED.

475
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:16,408
ALL THOSE YEARS OF
DIETING AND EXERCISE,

476
00:47:16,408 --> 00:47:18,117
AND THEN SUDDENLY
I HAD NO REGIME.

477
00:47:20,992 --> 00:47:23,200
EVEN WHEN I TRIED,

478
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,867
I COULDN’T
KEEP THE WEIGHT OFF.

479
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:31,158
I WORRIED THAT MY BODY WOULD
NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.

480
00:47:33,575 --> 00:47:37,908
I STARTED TO IGNORE ALL THE
ADVICE THAT OUR DOCTOR GAVE ME

481
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:43,325
AND SUDDENLY,
I JUST HATED THE PREGNANCY

482
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:46,325
AND I WISHED THAT THE BABY
WOULD COME OUT OF ME.

483
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:50,867
IN THE END, SHE DID.

484
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:55,117
IT WAS ME THAT KILLED HER,

485
00:47:55,117 --> 00:47:59,450
AND MY HUSBAND KNOWS IT,
AND NOW I HAVE NOTHING.

486
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:04,867
HEY, HEY, HEY.

487
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:08,450
ME AND MY HUSBAND,
WE’RE GOOD PEOPLE.

488
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:11,200
WE WANTED NOTHING MORE
THAN TO HAVE THAT BABY.

489
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,742
AND YOU’RE ANGRY
BECAUSE YOU FEEL CHEATED?

490
00:48:16,742 --> 00:48:18,867
CHEATED?

491
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:24,283
NO. THAT DOESN’T EVEN
BEGIN TO COVER IT.

492
00:48:26,325 --> 00:48:27,617
TO LOSE A BABY IS ONE THING,

493
00:48:27,617 --> 00:48:30,325
BUT TO COMPLETE A PREGNANCY,

494
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:33,283
AND THEY TELL YOU THAT THERE’S
NOTHING THEY CAN DO--

495
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,492
WHEN YOU HAVE TO
GIVE BIRTH TO YOUR BABY

496
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:40,908
AND THERE’S
NOTHING BUT SILENCE,

497
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:47,033
AND YOUR CHILD’S THERE
TO LOOK AT,

498
00:48:47,033 --> 00:48:50,908
AND SHE’S THERE
FOR YOU TO HOLD

499
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:52,325
BUT YOU KNOW YOU
CAN’T TAKE HER HOME.

500
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:56,325
TO KNOW THAT YOU’VE
GONE THAT FAR,

501
00:48:56,325 --> 00:48:59,367
AND YOU’LL NEVER GET TO
KNOW HER, IS JUST--

502
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:03,283
HEY.

503
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,742
WHAT YOU HAD
TO GO THROUGH,
IT’S NOT FAIR,

504
00:49:16,742 --> 00:49:19,700
BUT COME ON.

505
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,325
YOU THINK YOU’RE
THE ONLY WOMAN

506
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:25,283
THAT TRIES TO KEEP IN SHAPE
WHILE SHE’S PREGNANT?

507
00:49:25,283 --> 00:49:28,033
I’VE BEEN AROUND MODELS
ALL MY LIFE,

508
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:32,742
AND BELIEVE ME MAIA, YOU’RE
NOT THE ONE WITH PROBLEMS.

509
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:35,075
IT WASN’T YOU FAULT.

510
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:37,700
MY HUSBAND DOESN’T
EVEN LOOK AT ME IN
THE SAME WAY ANYMORE.

511
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,075
I THINK WE’RE OVER.

512
00:49:42,075 --> 00:49:47,325
WELL, SHAME ON HIM.

513
00:49:47,325 --> 00:49:51,908
AND IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE
THEN DARE I SAY IT,

514
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:53,450
MAYBE IT WASN’T
SUCH A BAD THING.

515
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:57,492
NO, HE’S A GOOD MAN.

516
00:49:57,492 --> 00:50:00,033
NO MEN ARE GOOD, MAIA.

517
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:03,158
WHY DO YOU THINK
I’M THE WAY I AM?

518
00:50:05,617 --> 00:50:07,367
TRUST ME,

519
00:50:07,367 --> 00:50:12,450
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

520
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:17,450
EVERYTHING WILL FALL
INTO PLACE, YOU’LL SEE.

521
00:50:20,325 --> 00:50:22,908
I WISH I COULD--

522
00:50:22,908 --> 00:50:23,950
WHAT?

523
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,492
I DON’T KNOW, BE MORE FREE,

524
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:32,450
SELF-ASSURED, COMFORTABLE
WITH WHO I AM, LIKE YOU.

525
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:36,617
LIKE ME?

526
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,908
YEAH.

527
00:50:37,908 --> 00:50:42,450
YOU’RE SO TOGETHER
AND HAPPY.

528
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,033
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
AND DON’T CARE WHAT YOU SAY,

529
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:46,783
