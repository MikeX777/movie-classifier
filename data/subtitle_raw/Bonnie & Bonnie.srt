1
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,120
Our prophet,

2
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,920
may he rest in peace.

3
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,320
He says:
“Oh, you young people,

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,240
those who are lucky to marry
should do so.

5
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,840
Those who accept deserve glory.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,240
Their bond is blessed.”

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,160
The two of them know each other
and are now engaged.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Why should I disapprove?

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,880
It is God’s will!

10
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,480
May God bless them
and give them peace,

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,120
a long life and happiness!

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,720
Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

13
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,480
Aren't you Florian Silbereisen?
- Fuck off, shit face!

14
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,760
Let’s fuck him over.

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Run after him and take his hand.

16
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,080
Come on, Yara! Come on!

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Go, go!

18
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,600
Okay, take her! Now.

19
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,400
Now! Go on!

20
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,120
What d’you want?
- It was all in fun.

21
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,600
All in fun. Let go.
- What d’you want?

22
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,040
Just a prank. They dared me
to hold your hand. That’s all.

23
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
A prank?

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,440
I swear. Let me go, please

25
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Then get lost.

26
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,640
Hey, schizo! Put that knife away!

27
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
What's wrong with that bitch?
- It's ok.

28
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,840
No big deal.
- Let’s get outta here!

29
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,560
No, I gotta go.
- Gotta play Mommy again?

30
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,680
Fuck off!

31
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,760
Just kidding, Yara!

32
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Brush thoroughly.
- Yeah!

33
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,440
I’ll check on you.
- Make som tea for Bab!

34
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,280
Can’t you do it yourself?
- C’mon, I gotta go.

35
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,440
Sure, you gotta work.
Big deals are waiting.

36
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,480
Okay, I’ll do it.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Now off to bed,
you little poopers.

38
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
Hey, you should film us!
- Do your own rap, you geeks!

39
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
Dude, now we gotta do it again.

40
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,360
There’s that bitch again!
You got the urge?

41
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,360
Should we rough up that slut?
- No, forget it.

42
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Count me in.
- No way. It was our stupid prank.

43
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Where have you been?

44
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Sorry, Dad.
I lost track of time.

45
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,760
It’s your fault I’m late.

46
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,160
This has to stop.

47
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
Sorry.
- People have started to talk.

48
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,760
"His kids do as they please."

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
"He has no idea
what they’re up to."

50
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,560
Take care.
- Good night.

51
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,800
Look at that lovesick jerk.

52
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,640
Forget it, man.
Vallah, she won’t let you near her.

53
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,320
He can’t hear you.
Earth to Bekim! Bekim!

54
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,200
C’mon, kick it in there!
- C’mon! C’mon! Do it!

55
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,400
Just shoot it!
Fuck! Shoot! Shoot!

56
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,000
Shoot! Shoot! Yeah!

57
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,320
Fuckin’ shit!

58
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,800
Every time that slut
works here I lose.

59
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,360
Come here if you got a problem.
- It’s your fault!

60
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,880
That you dick are losing?
- All your fault!

61
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,200
I’ll show you how to lose!
What d’you want from me?

62
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,600
Fuck off!

63
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,240
Let go.
- Cool it.

64
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,440
Just get a new betting form.
- Wanna go back to jail?

65
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,400
He's full of shit!
I want him outta here!

66
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,560
Why don’t you go out with me instead?
- Bekim ...

67
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Just for a drink. And if it’s
uncool, I’ll never, never ...

68
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,760
Hey dude, don’t ride me!
- No, I’m not kiddin’.

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,320
Bekim, don’t ride me.
Just forget it.

70
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,200
You can’t just stay home all night.
– Can’t I?

71
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,680
It’s sweet of you to care,
but I’m okay. Thanks.

72
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,240
Hey Bekim, don’t push me.
Forget it.

73
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,160
I told you so, dude!

74
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,120
Ouch! Hey!

75
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
So?

76
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
What did she say this time?

77
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,480
You keep getting prettier.
Men are gonna start lining up.

78
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,520
With Bakir at the front?
- As if I’d want that ugly weirdo.

79
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,120
Why are your eyes so red?

80
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,280
No idea. Allergy maybe?

81
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,520
Were you smoking pot?

82
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,800
How are you doing?
How are you, Bakir?

83
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,920
I told you we had visitors.

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,520
Sorry, you know how it is.
Lots to do.

85
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,360
You don’t even have a job.
- What do you know?

86
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,760
That’s enough!
- Most important: everybody’s fine.

87
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,280
Yeah.
- Look!

88
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,680
She looks like Leyla.

89
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,960
Sorry, Abaz.
Kids say things without thinking.

90
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Okay, good night. C’mon.

91
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,440
Father! – Go find a job.
You sit around doing nothing.

92
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,080
Why can’t we ever talk about her?

93
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Go to sleep.

94
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,400
Can’t you tell me
something about her?

95
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,640
Go to sleep.

96
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,280
Sorry.
- Trouble at home? I gotta go.

97
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
It’s okay. I understand.

98
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,600
I have to go. Remember to put
the beverages away. – Sure.

99
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,120
I’m late. See you.
- Bye.

100
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,120
Is she serious?
Shows up late and then takes a break!

101
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
Fuck her.
- Hey man!

102
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,880
Here’s Kiki. Did Sunny call?

103
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,520
Don’t freak out!
I just wanted to know where she is.

104
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,400
Well ...

105
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Hey, awesome wheels!

106
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,120
The man, the myth! Bekim!

107
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,720
Have a seat. What’s up?

108
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,680
Hey, what’s up?
- What d’you want?

109
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,840
Shall we go for a drink later?

110
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
No way. I’m meeting friends.

111
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,560
Since when d’you have friends?
- Hey Bekim, stop hitting on me!

112
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,400
Okay.
- Hands off! It’s my job.

113
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
And the blue Margaux.

114
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,400
Six forty.
The soda is my treat.

115
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,760
You know, that’s kind of our thing.

116
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,200
We film our pranks
and put ‘em online.

117
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,480
Cool.

118
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,440
So you survived the shock?

119
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,040
Your soda!

120
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,680
Wow, deluxe! Awesome wheels!

121
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,720
Best news of the day.
I come and you go.

122
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What d’you want, huh?
What d’you want from me?

123
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Chill out, girl!
- I’ll give you some real girl.

124
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You are so fucked up, man!

125
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,440
What was that about?
- Wanna go for a joyride, Yara?

126
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,240
When my boss sees I closed
the shop... - Kiki.

127
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,760
Hi, Kiki.

128
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,000
Where’s your name from?
- It’s Persian.

129
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,920
It means: the bold one.
- You’re Persian?

130
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,240
No, Albanian.

131
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,280
Okay, bold one. Can you drive?
- No, I’m just seventeen.

132
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Wanna learn?

133
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,400
Hey man!

134
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Your turn!

135
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
I’ll catch hell from my brother.

136
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
Relax. There’s nobody here.

137
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
You were cooler
with a knife at your neck.

138
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,680
Put it on “D” and pull.

139
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,440
One more, one more, okay.
- Yeah, okay.

140
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,760
Now take your foot
off the brake. Just do it.

141
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,040
Take your foot off. Yeah!

142
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,560
Now turn the corner.

143
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,280
Oh my God. Cool. I’m driving!

144
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,120
Now step on the gas
before we start backing up.

145
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Watch out.

146
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,640
Watch out! Stop!

147
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,880
Everything okay with you?

148
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Oh my God!

149
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,440
You look so high. So high!
- But you don’t!

150
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,680
You don’t!

151
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,920
Hey, did you really go to prison?

152
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,560
Why?
- I heard stories.

153
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,720
Okay, I believe what people say.

154
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,280
You can really get
on people's nerves.

155
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,560
Yeah, for a few months.
Breaking and entering ...

156
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
... assault and battery.

157
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,440
And how did you get the scar?

158
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,520
A long time ago. I was playing
with my big sister Sunny.

159
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
Do you live with her?

160
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,600
No, she lives in France.

161
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,800
Oh la la ... France.

162
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,400
Like with champagne

163
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,040
and the sea and ... blue water?

164
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,560
Exactly.

165
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,160
Someday I’m gonna live there, too.

166
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,400
Cool.
- Yeah.

167
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,160
But damn far away.
- Yeah.

168
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,360
I know what you mean.
My sister ran away, too.

169
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,520
She abandoned us.

170
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,840
My sister didn’t abandon me.

171
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,720
Sorry.
- It’s okay.

172
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,960
No, really. I’m sorry.

173
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,120
For real?

174
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,680
Hey, did you get rid of the car?

175
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,280
It was just a kiss, okay?

176
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I’m not a lesbian.

177
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What’s up?

178
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,800
Hey princess!
- Get lost!

179
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,960
Fuck off! Adults only!

180
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,920
Fuck off!
- What’s your problem?

181
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Fuck you!
- C’mon!

182
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,200
Come back here!
Stop! Give it to me!

183
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,160
Stop it! Gimme that!
Ouch!

184
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
Stop! Stop! Stop!

185
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Stop it! Stop it!

186
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Hey Yara!

187
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,880
What happened?
- Nothing.

188
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,560
Your dinner’s in the fridge.
Should I warm it up?

189
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Later.

190
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,920
I’m going out a bit, Dad.
- You don’t need to go out.

191
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Where to?
- Just for a second.

192
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,520
Okay, go on.

193
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,800
Hey, come on.

194
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,880
Just a sec.

195
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,800
What’s up?

196
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,520
What do you care?
Yeah, okay.

197
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
I won’t be long.

198
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,120
C’mon. Come on!
- Where to?

199
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,160
You’ll see.

200
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,720
Have you been waiting the whole time?
- Maybe.

201
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Terrific.

202
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,880
What’s up?
- Nothing.

203
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,240
C’mon, tell me.

204
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Somehow I can’t stop
thinking about you.

205
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,560
Wow, are you in love with me?

206
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
You’re so fucked up.

207
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,200
You know ...

208
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,280
We can’t do this kind of stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

209
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,400
It’s bad enough for us
if we got a boyfriend.

210
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,160
Everybody has the right
to live as they please, right?

211
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,760
Yeah, but ...
- Hey.

212
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,560
I’m just difficult. Sorry.
It’s so fucking complicated.

213
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Calm down.

214
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,360
I don’t think you know
how special you are.

215
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,440
Will you dance for me?

216
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,600
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
What time is it?

217
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,920
I’m in fucking trouble. C’mon.

218
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,120
But it was worth it.

219
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,440
Damn it, Yara!
Answer the phone!

220
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
She’s late.
- I told you so.

221
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,800
What did you say?

222
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,720
That we’re crazy? And then?

223
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,920
Not here. What if somebody sees us?

224
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,640
Cool down, lady.

225
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,120
C’mon, get in the car!
- I’m coming.

226
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,920
He’s your brother?

227
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
So that’s your date?

228
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,240
You’re a bad influence
for my little sister.

229
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
So that’s why you want
to go out with me?

230
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Then stop hitting on me!

231
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,280
Leave her alone,
or I’ll fuck you over! Okay?

232
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
We were just kidding.
- Shut up!

233
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,120
Cool it, dude. We’re just friends.
Everything’s okay.

234
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Stop that shit!

235
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,040
Where’d you get that?

236
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,000
Fuck!

237
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Your phone!

238
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,600
What?
- Give me your phone!

239
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
No.

240
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,160
You think you can fool me?
I saw everything.

241
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,320
You didn’t see a thing!
- You’ll never see her again!

242
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,320
Do you really
wanna do this to Bab?

243
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,040
What’s wrong with her?

244
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,120
Where were you?
- It’s nothing, Father.

245
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,120
She was out with friends.
Everything’s okay.

246
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,520
You just go to work
and come home. Understand?

247
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,280
Understand?
- Yeah.

248
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,960
That’s too dangerous.
- Just checking if you’re okay.

249
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,480
You gotta get outta here.
- When can I see you again?

250
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,040
Hey, Kiki. Bekim took my phone,
and I’m grounded.

251
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
You aren’t asleep?

252
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,160
Why aren’t you asleep yet?

253
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,520
I’m worried, Yara.
You come home so late.

254
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Okay, Babi.

255
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,320
C’mon, go to bed. Good night.
- Good night.

256
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Good night.

257
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,080
Yara?
- I’ll have a look.

258
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,640
What’s wrong?
- Nothing. Just the stupid cat.

259
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,960
Hey, are you nuts?
- Just the stupid cat.

260
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,680
I missed you.

261
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,120
Bekim’s picking me up.
- I want to see you again.

262
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,080
He‘s got his eye on me all day.

263
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,520
I can’t even go to the toilet
without him noticing.

264
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
That’s sick.

265
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,440
My father’s totally stressed out.

266
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,360
If Bekim tells him about it ...

267
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,360
That bum thinks
he’s a real big shot.

268
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,760
Like I said, he’s sick.

269
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,720
That’s how it is with us.

270
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,400
I mean, we could talk
about your family, too.

271
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,080
Sorry.

272
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
And now?

273
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
I do wanna be with you.

274
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,200
Yeah?
- Yeah.

275
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,640
But only in secret?

276
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,960
That can be cool, too.

277
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Where?

278
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,880
I think it’s kind of nice here.

279
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,320
Sure, it might not be France ...

280
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
I’ll sneak out somehow, chérie.

281
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,000
Yara?
- Okay, tomorrow. 9 p.m. Schwanenwik.

282
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,600
Put on something fancy.

283
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,120
Babi.
- Bekim told me to pick you up.

284
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Let’s go.

285
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,880
You won’t tell?
- No.

286
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,600
Promise?
- Promise.

287
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Thanks, sweetheart.

288
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,680
Leave the window ajar.

289
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Sleep tight.

290
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,360
It’s much too expensive here.

291
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,400
Did you reserve a table?

292
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,720
What if we didn’t?
- We’re booked up tonight.

293
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,480
Sure.
You think we’re broke or what?

294
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Is that enough?
- Like I said. We’re booked up.

295
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don’t believe you, asshole.

296
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,400
We aren’t good enough, huh?
- C’mon, let’s go.

297
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,400
No, there’s nobody here.
We’ll just sit down and order.

298
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,480
Don’t raise your voice. Would you
please leave the premises at once.

299
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,080
Hey asshole, you aren’t
gonna kick us out!

300
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,680
We refuse to eat
at a fucking joint like this!

301
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,040
C’mon, Yara!

302
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,280
Your face. Awesome.
Oh my God.

303
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,880
We’re like Bonnie and Clyde.

304
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,960
Yeah, we’re Bonnie and Bonnie.

305
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,880
We’re Bonnie and Bonnie,
and nobody can stop us!

306
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,480
Bonnie and Bonnie
against the rest of the world!

307
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,400
Hey, Yara.
- Hey.

308
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,920
Are you pissed at me?
- No, not at all.

309
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,880
Why don’t you stop by anymore
or answer my messages?

310
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,200
Bekim has my phone, and I’m grounded.
- Fuck

311
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,400
Why?
- No idea. I lost my key.

312
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,280
I looked for it and got home late.
He’s such a bum.

313
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,520
That’s fucking awful.

314
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,200
I was really hoping
you’d be there tonight.

315
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,200
What’re you doing?
- A performance at that art place.

316
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,080
Mike and I had a big fight.
It’s really stupid.

317
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,400
Oh well. Keep cool.
- See ya.

318
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,880
Hey, you know what? I’ll be there.
- Yeah?

319
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Yeah.
- Yeah?

320
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,960
Okay, I gotta go. See ya.
- See ya.

321
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,680
I’m off work. Time for
my watchdog to take me home.

322
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,600
10 P.M. GALLERY
BY THE BRIDGE

323
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,920
They’re asleep.

324
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,280
I’m going to bed with Jeta.

325
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,080
Good night.

326
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,160
Sleep tight.

327
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,680
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

328
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,960
Are you sure?

329
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Listen ...

330
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,800
If anything happens,

331
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,320
call this number.

332
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,200
Okay? Yeah?

333
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,920
Don’t forget the bed.
- Yeah.

334
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,480
Yara!
- Hey, that went fast.

335
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,560
Can I go now?
- What’s up?

336
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,520
What’s up, bro?

337
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,680
C’mon, let's go.

338
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,040
What’s that freak doing here?

339
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,880
What’s going on, Yara?
- The freak’s coming with us.

340
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,600
Jamal.

341
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,240
This is Tony, Mikey, Akhi ...
- I’m Abdullah.

342
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,080
He’s Akhi, ‘cause of his beard.
Looks like a terrorist.

343
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,480
Okay, guys, let’s go.

344
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,600
Boy, am I hungry. C’mon!

345
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,000
What’s going on?
- Wait and see.

346
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Let’s get something to drink first.

347
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,080
Want a smoke?
- Hey guys, this way.

348
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,920
This would look real nice
in my poolroom, wouldn’t it?

349
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,440
This crap?
- Yeah.

350
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Dude, I can paint
you that with my dick.

351
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,280
Smoking is not allowed here.
- Of course not.

352
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,080
Didn’t you say you were quitting?
- Yeah, sure.

353
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,160
No touching either.

354
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
Dude, what’s wrong with Yara?

355
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,640
No!

356
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,720
Bonnie and Bonnie!

357
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,840
Come to my place.

358
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,680
No.
- C’mon. It’s my birthday.

359
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,440
Seriously? That pick-up works?

360
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,440
This is Yara’s mailbox ...

361
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,800
Where is Yara?

362
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,640
Where is Yara?

363
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,560
Sweet, you and your sister?

364
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,720
Is that France?
That’s where she lives?

365
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,440
Why no pictures of your parents?

366
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,360
My parents don’t have
any pictures of me either.

367
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,440
Spare your pity. I don’t care.

368
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,560
Sorry, you don’t have to tell me,
if you don’t want to.

369
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,360
There are thousands
of nicer things we could do.

370
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
You’re so beautiful.

371
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,520
Who’s that?

372
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,440
Where’s Yara?
- At home!?

373
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,160
Are you kidding me?

374
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,400
She went off with that freak
from the bar. - Kiki?

375
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,640
Yeah, right.

376
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,160
Are you nuts? You ratted on Yara.
She’s in big trouble ‘cause of you.

377
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
Me? Are you all whacko?

378
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,680
You are brainless.
C’mon!

379
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,760
Yeah, with everything
and extra cheese.

380
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,400
Okay, thanks.

381
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,360
I dare you to open the door
topless for the pizza man.

382
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,800
No problem.
- Deal.

383
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,640
Deal. But only if you stay with me.

384
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,680
For always?

385
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,680
Just tell me if you’re tired of me.

386
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,440
How about a little trust?

387
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Stop, stop, stop!

388
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,000
Hey, what do I get for it?

389
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,840
Whatever you like.

390
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,560
Yara, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

391
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,600
What are you doing, damn it?

392
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,400
You’re watching a first-class
domestic drama! - Turn that off!

393
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,240
Get off of her!
- Get up, girl!

394
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,320
Put something on.
Put something on!

395
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,240
Don’t, Bekim!
- Get back in there!

396
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
Get out!

397
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,080
What d’you want?
What’re you doing here?

398
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,800
You still don’t get it, huh?
I go for pussy!

399
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,240
I go for pussy!

400
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,720
What’s the deal?
What’s the deal? Huh?

401
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,160
What’s the deal?

402
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,480
I love Yara, and she loves me.

403
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,960
That’s enough, man!

404
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,520
We’ll solve this another way.
- I can hardly wait!

405
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,280
You won’t change a thing
between us! Not a thing!

406
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,920
Please, don’t.

407
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,320
I curse you.

408
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,440
Turn that off!

409
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,160
ALBANIAN CATCHES SISTER
RED-HANDED WITH LESBIAN!

410
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,040
Get up! What’s this?

411
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Who sent me this?
Tell me! Who sent it?

412
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,920
You’re hurting me, Dad!
- What did you do to me?

413
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,360
You’re grounded!
You’re staying here!

414
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,720
Everyone despises me.
They look away.

415
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,880
You like it? You like it?
- Stop it, Dad!

416
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,280
What do you want? Tell me!
- Look what you’ve done.

417
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,320
You’re a whore just like your sister!

418
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,080
I’ll make up for it ...

419
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
Where’s your fucking brother?

420
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,400
My brother did what’s right.

421
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,800
Now everybody knows
your sister is a lesbian slut.

422
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,000
Get outta here. Get outta here.

423
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,960
Where’s Akhi? - Fuck off!
Look after your own family!

424
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,400
What kind of men can’t keep
their women under control?

425
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,200
There are over 20,000 clicks.

426
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,800
Don’t look at it.

427
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,280
I’m so sorry, sweetheart.

428
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,360
I didn’t want it to happen.

429
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,880
I don’t think you’re bad.

430
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,680
They’re coming today
to ask for your hand.

431
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,640
Your mother wore it
on that day, too.

432
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,440
It’s pretty.

433
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
I got your number from Isso.

434
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,400
He said you might know
where Sunny is.

435
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Yeah, I’m her sister.

436
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,600
Where is she? C’mon, tell me!

437
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,760
Asshole, stop saying that about
my sister! I don’t believe a word!

438
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,920
Don’t worry, sweetheart.

439
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,040
Oh my God, Kiki.
What are you doing here?

440
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,400
Working.
- Working?

441
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,040
Oh shit, my mistake.
I forgot to tell you

442
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,440
that we got no place
for scum like you.

443
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,440
Sorry.
- What?

444
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,680
You got it right.

445
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,240
My money?
- Money? You got money?

446
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,000
No. You?
- Anybody got any money?

447
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,160
Got money? No?
- Sorry. No money.

448
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,120
What money?

449
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,880
What a bunch of
pathetic motherfuckers.

450
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,920
Hey, you stupid cunt!

451
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:48,320
How dare you!
Don’t give me that stupid look!

452
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,200
It’s your fault Yara has to marry
that fucking neighbor she hates.

453
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,440
It’s all your fault!

454
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,680
So? What do you think?

455
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,840
That bad?

456
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,040
You look pretty.

457
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,560
You look fantastic.

458
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,800
Turn that off!

459
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,360
Our prophet ...

460
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,960
May he rest in peace.

461
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,160
He says:
“Oh, you young people,

462
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,120
those who are lucky
to marry should do so.

463
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,600
Those who accept deserve glory.

464
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,040
Their bond is blessed.”

465
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,440
The two of them know each
other and are now engaged.

466
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,480
Why should I disapprove?

467
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,400
It is God’s will!

468
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,040
May God bless them
and give them peace,

469
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,840
a long life and happiness!

470
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,560
Congratulations!
- Congratulations.

471
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,240
Excuse me for a minute.

472
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,280
Must be the excitement.

473
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,360
What’s wrong? – I just need
a break. The belt is too tight.

474
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,520
Open up. Open up.

475
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,920
C’mon, open it!

476
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,560
Jeta, open the window.
- No!

477
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:37,280
I’ll be right there.

478
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,000
Open it, Yara!

479
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,760
Open it!
- Open it, Yara!

480
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,520
Kiki, Kiki, no! No!

481
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,640
Open the door, Yara!

482
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,800
Run, Kiki! Bekim will kill you!
- Come with me!

483
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,920
I just got engaged!
- But I love you!

484
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,400
Open the door, Yara!

485
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,080
No!

486
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,160
Please, don’t go!

487
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,520
Yara, open the door!
Open the door!

488
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,960
Where to, Kiki?

489
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,160
Fuck, Kiki!
- C’mon!

490
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:35,360
What are we doing here?
- We’re alive!

491
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,240
C’mon, hurry.
Watch out. Let’s go.

492
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,960
40, 20, 90.

493
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,760
Here, take the bag.

494
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,320
Fucking whore!

495
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,400
Bekim, you bastard!

496
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,680
Your fucking sister
took everything in my safe!

497
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,120
Either you take care
of things or I will!

498
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,800
What if I never see
my siblings again?

499
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,600
Baby, I promise.
Everything will be good.

500
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,360
Mohammed’s gonna blame Bekim.
- Yara!

501
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,480
That asshole wanted to marry you off.
– He's still my brother ...

502
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,240
You think he’s gonna kill us?
- Bullshit.

503
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,120
Bekim’s a whacko, but he’s no killer.

504
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,760
Fuck Bekim! Fuck ‘em all.

505

ALBANIAN GIRL FLEES FROM HER FAMILY

506
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,240
Kiki, we’re famous!

507
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,520
They all want us to make it! Look!
- Yara ...

508
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,520
I want us to make it, okay?

509
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,800
Everything will be fine.

510
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,600
I promise.

511
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,640
Burglary, multiple thefts,
assault and battery, car theft.

512
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,040
That’s quite a list.
- I’m worried about my daughter.

513
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,400
She’s a child.
- That Kiki is crazy.

514
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,680
Do you think Kiki Gerlach
is dangerous?

515
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,040
That lesbian stole my car,
and my sister ran off ...

516
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,720
Don’t tell the whole world!

517
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,400
What did he say?

518
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,400
Why did your daughter
run away with her?

01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,080
Everything okay?
- Ouch, don't!

524
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,080
What is it?
- I think I dislocated my shoulder.

525
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,880
Can you ... can you get out?

526
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,440
Can you get out?
C’mon, hold on tight.

527
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,520
Not there.

528
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,360
We gotta get away, okay?

529
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,240
C’mon, we gotta hide.

530
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,880
Yes?
- Herr Ibrahim?

531
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,680
Your son’s car was found
on Highway B4 outside Uelzen.

532
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,680
A total wreck.
- An accident?

533
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,160
Neither of the girls
were found by the car.

534
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,120
Do you have any idea
where they were going?

535
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,360
Friends? Relatives?

536
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:16,960
No, nothing.
- If you hear anything, let us know.

537
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,400
France is number 1 in hip hop.

538
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,360
You could be a famous dancer.

539
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,160
You’re really serious, you freak?

540
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,480
I love you.

541
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,960
Did you let Sunny know
that we’re coming?

542
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,520
I don’t have to.

543
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,240
But if you like, I will.
Later, babe, okay?

544
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,040
Bring her back to me.
- You can trust me, Dad.

545
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,440
You promised.
- I’ll explain it to you.

546
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:42,120
You ran away.
You abandoned us like Leyla.

547
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,240
That isn’t right.
I love you, sweetheart.

548
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,760
I hate you. And Halit
and Krenar hate you, too.

549
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,240
It’s all her fault.
She destroyed our family.

550
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:58,880
It’s her fault.
I hate both of you.

551
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:06,320
Dad, my father,
please forgive me.

552
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,320
Now I’ve lost my second daughter.

553
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,240
Babi, no!

554
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,480
You have a temperature.

555
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,760
Your wound is still bleeding.
We can’t go on like this.

556
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,920
You have to go to a hospital.
- And right back to prison?

557
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,200
We’ll go to Leyla. In Uelzen.

558
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,120
She’s a doctor.
- You hate your sister.

559
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,280
Everything is my fault.

560
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,760
Go away.
- I’m not going anywhere.

561
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,160
Hey, did you forget?
The two of us forever!

562
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,080
Are you really giving up?

563
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:30,160
Kiki!
- Yara, you can still leave now.

564
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,640
I stole the car, and I broke
into the gambling joint.

565
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,600
I don’t want to leave.

566
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,200
You might never see
your siblings again.

567
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,440
I want to go to France with you.
- I don’t want to go with you.

568
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,840
I love you.
- I don’t love you.

569
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:55,280
Go on, fuck off. Fuck off!

570
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,800
Yara, fuck off, you slut!

571
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,960
Fuck off! Go away!

572
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,320
Go away, fuck off! Go away!

573
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,760
Go away!

574
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,680
Go away!

575
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,480
We’ll make it!

576
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,120
To all those haters out there:
We are Bonnie and Bonnie.

577
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,680
None of you motherfuckers
will ever tear us apart.

578
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,280
Bekim!
Look in the glove compartment.

579
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,720
Yara, we’ll manage some other way.

580
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,520
My dearest!

581
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,600
I know everything.
The police were here.

582
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,960
Come in. I’ll fix you up first.

583
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,760
There we are.

584
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,440
Your arm will be okay soon.

585
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:14,560
It will hurt for a while, but
the painkiller will kick in soon.

586
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,080
Thank you.
- Sure.

587
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,040
So you’re lesbian?

588
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,040
No idea. Who cares?

589
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,120
What if I am?
Does that bother you?

590
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,120
Did she talk you
into running away?

591
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,960
Leyla, you know what life
is like in Wilhelmsburg.

592
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:08,240
It’s no life at all.

593
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,600
Working in that
lousy shop every day.

594
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,360
Then smoking pot with friends,
then putting the kids to bed.

595
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,080
Until I get married, and
the crap starts all over again.

596
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,360
So now you can understand
why I ran away.

597
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,240
I had to take over
all your duties.

598
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,880
Think Babi would have acted
differently if I had stayed?

599
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,960
Kiki is the only person
who cares about what I want.

600
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,360
So you love her?
- Why do you ask?

601
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,400
Because it’s a big step.

602
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,640
We have so many followers
who support us.

603
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,720
What’s wrong, Leyla?
Are you against us now?

604
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,640
No, it’s good
that you’re fighting.

605
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:59,000
I love my husband.
I paid a high price for my freedom.

606
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,760
Are you coming?
- Just a minute.

607
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,680
Would you do it again?

608
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,400
It’s your life, Yara.

609
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,000
Right.

610
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,520
I’m seventeen.
I’ll decide for myself.

611
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,560
I’m so glad I have you.

612
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,560
We’ll go to France.

613
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,120
Somehow. Tonight.

614
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,560
Because we’re
Bonnie and Bonnie, right?

615
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,160
Right.

616
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,840
You severely injured a man
in a betting shop?

617
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:58,240
Not severely.
Anyway, the guy’s a dickhead.

618
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,200
And Kiki was previously convicted.
Any other secrets?

619
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:07,160
Who cares? Whatever I say
you won’t believe us.

620
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,400
What’s your problem?
Is everybody your enemy?

621
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,160
Huh?
- Leyla ...

622
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,400
I’m not going back.
- You’re just making it worse.

623
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,880
You’re ruining your whole life.

624
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,400
What’s going on?
- I’d like you to tell me!

625
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:37,440
... about northern Germany’s
prettiest crooks: Bonnie and Bonnie.

626
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,600
C’mon, Yara. Let’s go.

627
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,760
You stay here.
- Let me go.

628
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,720
You ratted on us?
- What? No!

629
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:08,840
Let her go.
The police are coming.

630
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,120
You’re all the same!

631
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,800
Go, take the car key!

632
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,560
I’m driving.
- Here, Yara.

633
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,320
Move it, move it!
Take off!

634
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,280
Move it, Yara! Move it!

635
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,120
What do I do?
- Straight ahead!

636
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,280
Go faster!
- Okay!

637
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,440
Is he behind us?
- No, everything’s fine.

638
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,600
You’re doing great.
Everything’s fine.

639
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,440
What?
- Everything’s fine.

640
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,080
What?
- That guy is there.

641
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,240
What do I do?
- Just keep driving faster.

642
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,920
Straight ahead, straight ahead!

643
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,320
Go faster. Go right.
You gotta turn right.

644
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,240
Where?

645
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,360
Okay now. Turn right.

646
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,520
Fuck, the cops!

647
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:32,120
Damn it, we’re trapped.
Brake, brake, brake! Brake!

648
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:06,280
I won’t leave you.
I promise.

649
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:18,640
Fuck off! All of you! Fuck off!

650
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,840
Fuck off! All of you!

651
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,480
Go away!
- Police! Lower the gun!

652
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,720
Fuck off!
- Drop the gun!

653
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,040
Go away!
- Drop it!

654
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,840
Kiki, drop the gun!
- Drop the gun!

655
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:37,040
C’mon, drop the gun.
- Stop it!

656
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:44,280
Kiki, we have so many supporters.

657
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,760
And we have each other.
That’s what counts.

658
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,800
Look at me. Look at me ...

659
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,200
I love you, okay?

660
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,240
Szeretlek.

661
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,880
We can visit your sister later.
– It’ll be okay.

662
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:09,560
My sister isn’t in France.
She’s in prison.

663
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,320
Listen to your girlfriend.
Put the gun down.

664
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,720
I don’t care. No need to apologize.
It’s no problem.

665
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,400
C’mon, drop the gun.
- Everything will be okay.

666
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,800
We’ll make it.

667
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,360
Stop!
- Fuck off!

668
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:38,080
EGY ÉVVEL KÉSŐBB
