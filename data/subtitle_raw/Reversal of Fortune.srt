1
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,393
This was my body.

2
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:45,873
On December 27, 1979,

3
00:03:45,907 --> 00:03:48,542
I lay in bed all day.

4
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:52,246
Whether I was asleep or in a coma

5
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,082
later became a subject of dispute.

6
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,254
When my breathing
became obstructed...

7
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:01,923
Maria.

8
00:04:01,956 --> 00:04:05,392
My husband, Claus von Bulow,

9
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:09,463
finally did as my maid
had been urging all day.

10
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,498
He summoned a physician.

11
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:13,000
Dr Paultees?

12
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:17,905
I stopped breathing. My
heart stopped beating.

13
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,408
By this time, I was
certainly in a deep coma

14
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:25,179
from which I awoke
several hours later.

15
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:28,582
By the next morning,
I was myself again.

16
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:31,986
There's no reason
for all this fuss.

17
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:34,088
I never felt better
in my whole life.

18
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,358
This first coma aroused
suspicion and fear

19
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,828
in the minds of my
personal maid Maria,

20
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:44,966
my son Alex, and my
elder daughter Ala.

21
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,432
From this time on,
though they never

22
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,470
voiced their suspicions to me,

23
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:52,539
they kept a vigilant eye on Claus.

24
00:04:53,574 --> 00:04:55,109
A year later,

25
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:56,844
just before Christmas,

26
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:59,981
their darkest fears
seemed justified.

27
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:03,817
- Has Mummy had breakfast yet?
- No, we haven't seen her.

28
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,551
My husband did not
want our daughter

29
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,470
Cosima to see what he had found,

30
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:26,107
so he motioned to
his stepson Alex.

31
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:44,892
Second coma. My pulse was 38,

32
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:48,429
my temperature 81.6 degrees.

33
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:53,534
Did you call an ambulance?

34
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:58,005
Nicholas, would you ask Robert
to open the main gates.

35
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:01,008
We're expecting an ambulance.

36
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:04,378
Send an ambulance immediately...

37
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:06,613
- Keep her in something warm.
- Thank you.

38
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:08,682
Oh, a blanket or
anything you can find.

39
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:12,186
All this activity was pointless.

40
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:14,922
We'd better do an EEG.

41
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:17,224
I never woke from this coma,

42
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,559
and I never will.

43
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:24,932
I am what doctors call "persistent
vegetative", a vegetable.

44
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:30,040
According to medical
experts, I could

45
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,706
stay like this for
a very long time,

46
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:36,077
brain-dead, body better than ever.

47
00:06:38,112 --> 00:06:43,951
Enter Robert Brillhoffer, former
Manhattan district attorney.

48
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,105
My two children from my first

49
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,956
marriage, Alex and
Ala von Auersberg,

50
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,925
hired Brillhoffer to
investigate the case.

51
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,398
He put a "do not resuscitate"
order on her hospital chart.

52
00:06:57,431 --> 00:07:00,334
They sent Alex and a
private investigator

53
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,575
back to my Newport
cottage, Clarendon

54
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:05,939
Court, to search for drugs.

55
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:12,980
They found plenty,
in Claus's closet.

56
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,749
On top of that, the
hospital lab reported

57
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:21,022
that my blood insulin on
admission was 14 times normal,

58
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:25,592
a level almost surely
caused by injection.

59
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:29,063
Insulin injection could
readily cause coma...

60
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:32,066
Or death.

61
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,971
This encrusted needle tested
positive for insulin.

62
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,477
Alex couldn't wait to get
back and show Brillhoffer.

63
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:47,181
Now they felt they had
the murder weapon.

64
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:50,351
All they lacked was the motive.

65
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:54,021
At that moment, my husband was
vacationing with his mistress,

66
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:58,725
the very beautiful soap-opera
actress, Alexandra Isles.

67
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:00,327
Oh, God.

68
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,563
Mrs Isles, a divorcee,

69
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:06,200
was the daughter of an old
friend, Count Billy Botsky.

70
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,040
Brillhoffer also discovered
that, at my death,

71
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:17,244
Claus, whose own net worth
was only a million dollars,

72
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:21,215
stood to inherit 14
million from me.

73
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:24,310
Alexandra later
testified that Claus

74
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:27,621
showed her a legal
analysis of my will.

75
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,695
On the evidence collected by Alex,
Ala and their lawyer Brillhoffer,

76
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,087
my husband was accused
of twice trying

77
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:39,566
to murder me with
injections of insulin.

78
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:43,770
On March 16, 1982,

79
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:47,108
he was found guilty
on both counts.

80
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:49,510
Committed on December 27, 1979...

81
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:53,614
Even Alexandra Isles
testified against him.

82
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:55,082
Guilty.

83
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,383
As to count two,

84
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:59,853
charged the defendant committed
on December 21, 1980,

85
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:02,089
a crime of assault
with intent to murder.

86
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:03,857
- How do you find?
- Guilty.

87
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,295
You are about to see how Claus
von Bulow sought to reverse

88
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,398
or escape from that
jury's verdict.

89
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:14,801
You tell me.

90
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:22,276
And two.

91
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:26,079
Here it comes. Here we go, taking
you downtown. And Dersh...

92
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:31,785
Take it in. Foul. Okay, here I go.

93
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,521
Watch the hands. Watch the hands.

94
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,662
Yeah, hello.

95
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:44,131
What?

96
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,102
Oh, shit. Bottom line.

97
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,104
Aw, shit.

98
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:14,127
Hi.

99
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:23,304
Let's try that again. Hi,
Dad. Remember Maggie?

100
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:26,673
Hi, Maggie.

101
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,446
They're gonna fry. The
Johnson brothers.

102
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,216
What? But...

103
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,287
Two black kids broke their
father out of prison.

104
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:43,324
The father shot two people and the
sons are convicted of murder.

105
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:45,559
A lawyer prays for
an innocent client.

106
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:49,196
Finally, finally, I get two. Both
of them are gonna get zapped.

107
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,330
No more appeals?

108
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,798
Supreme Court but, this
was the best shot.

109
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:56,537
Whoa. It's the press.

110
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,672
You don't want to
talk to the press?

111
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:03,610
Dershowitz Psychiatric Institute.

112
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,213
Yeah, hang on a second.

113
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,749
Claus von Bulow.

114
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:12,653
- It's a reporter.
- With an English accent?

115
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:15,489
What paper do you represent?

116
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:16,923
If I can't save two innocent kids,

117
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,491
what's the point? They
might as well hang them.

118
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:20,361
Yeah, one second. Sorry.

119
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:22,596
He really seems to
think he's von Bulow.

120
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:24,231
Hello. This is Alan Dershowitz.

121
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,866
Who are you? What do you want?

122
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:33,374
- It is von Bulow.
- Back in business.

123
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:42,249
- Can I help you, sir?
- Claus von Bulow?

124
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:44,251
Elevators to the left.

125
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:53,560
Holy shit.

126
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,936
Hello?

127
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,711
Hello?

128
00:12:10,744 --> 00:12:14,715
Professor Dershowitz.
Hello, hello.

129
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:18,051
- How good of you to come.
- Pleasure.

130
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,253
Won't you sit down?

131
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,263
- Do you play?
- That? No.

132
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:34,067
Most people think
it's a game of luck.

133
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,603
Actually, it's largely
a matter of nerve.

134
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,811
Nothing, thank you, Charles.

135
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:48,915
Why don't we go to Delmonico's
and have a proper lunch?

136
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,451
Whatever.

137
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:56,590
I should tell you, that I
have the greatest respect

138
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:59,793
for the intelligence and
integrity of the Jewish people.

139
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,166
When I married Sunny, she was the

140
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,100
most beautiful
divorcee in the world,

141
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,969
and one of the wealthiest.

142
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:12,673
Even so, we never got this table.

143
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:14,741
Professor Dershowitz.

144
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,880
Dr von Bulow.

145
00:13:19,913 --> 00:13:22,849
Two injections of insulin,
already I'm a doctor.

146
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:26,353
In America, it's fame
rather than class.

147
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,856
Now, after all this
unpleasantness,

148
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,058
I always get the best table.

149
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,061
Speaking of the unpleasantness...

150
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:37,898
Oh, yes. We'd better
discuss your fee.

151
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,703
Okay. $300 an hour.

152
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,072
Good Lord.

153
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:48,409
You know, I used to be
a lawyer in London.

154
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,910
That sounds a bit steep.

155
00:13:49,943 --> 00:13:51,812
It's average for a case like this.

156
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:54,080
Besides, I do a lot
of pro Bono work.

157
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:57,384
You'd pay for that. Plus, I have
to pay students, associates.

158
00:13:57,418 --> 00:14:00,123
Are you saying that if I agree to

159
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:03,156
pay 300, you will
handle my appeal?

160
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:06,527
No, not so far. Doesn't
look like my kind of case.

161
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:09,863
I'm not a hired gun.

162
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:12,533
I gotta feel that some moral or
constitutional issue is at stake.

163
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:15,168
But I'm absolutely innocent.

164
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:19,406
And my civil liberties have
been egregiously violated.

165
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,425
Two black kids are
facing the electric

166
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:23,376
chair for a crime
they did not commit.

167
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:26,379
They are innocent.

168
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:32,419
Well, before you assume I'm
guilty, won't you hear my story?

169
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:34,721
No. Never let defendants explain.

170
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,723
Puts most of them in
an awkward position.

171
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:40,393
- How do you mean?
- Lying.

172
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:44,831
But I give you my
word as a gentleman.

173
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,569
Oh. Well...

174
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:58,479
Won't you at least read the record
and see if you can find something

175
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,915
constitutional?

176
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:07,020
You do have one thing
in your favour.

177
00:15:09,523 --> 00:15:10,523
Everybody hates you.

178
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:19,466
Well, that's a start.

179
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,503
Come on, Maxwell.
Yeah. Come on, Max.

180
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:24,771
- It was a hit.
- Yes.

181
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:31,244
- So, what do you think?
- Oh, he did it. He did it.

182
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:33,480
Of course he did it. Can we win?

183
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:35,482
A hundred to one
against. The maid...

184
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:37,515
The maid schmeared him on both

185
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:39,920
comas. Look at this.
It says here...

186
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:43,256
After you realised that Mrs.
Von Bulow had not gotten up,

187
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,491
what did you do?

188
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,760
I came downstairs,

189
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:51,264
and Mr von Bulow said that
Madame had a very sore throat,

190
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,834
and I didn't have to do any work,

191
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,469
and she was in bed all day.

192
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:11,484
What are you doing?
Did we ring for you?

193
00:16:19,059 --> 00:16:21,628
She's ice-cold.

194
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:24,030
Madame. Mrs von Bulow.

195
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:27,968
Leave her alone. She's sleeping.

196
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,537
She was drinking last night.
We didn't get any rest.

197
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,038
She's not sleeping.

198
00:16:33,774 --> 00:16:35,508
She's unconscious.

199
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:39,512
- You must call a doctor.
- Maria.

200
00:16:41,281 --> 00:16:42,883
Go on.

201
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:55,195
A half-hour later,
she had not moved.

202
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:57,998
I went back and forth all morning.

203
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:04,605
Finally, mid-afternoon, Mr von
Bulow spoke to Dr Paultees.

204
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:07,708
But he lied to doctor.

205
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,576
Yes, she's sleeping now,
but she was up earlier

206
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,278
this morning to the bathroom
and had a soft drink,

207
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,581
so I don't think, there's
any cause for alarm...

208
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:18,585
But she never moved. Never got up.

209
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:22,856
She was lying in the
same position all day.

210
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:26,793
Later her heart stops, and Dr
Paultees, he comes and saves her.

211
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:31,598
After they go to the hospital,
I'm changing the sheets.

212
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:34,300
I find a puddle of urine.

213
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,036
If Madame went to the bathroom,

214
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,739
she would not have
peed in her bed.

215
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:41,708
Right. Why would Claus
lie about that?

216
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:45,045
Well, it's suspicious
but hardly criminal.

217
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:46,613
How about the second coma?

218
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:49,616
Oh, Maria wasn't in
Newport for that one.

219
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:50,984
But shortly before
the second coma...

220
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:52,619
I'm cleaning up their room

221
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:55,121
when I find Mr von
Bulow's white canvas bag

222
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:57,123
packed for Newport.

223
00:17:57,157 --> 00:18:00,627
Inside, there's a
little black bag.

224
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:04,297
A bottle of insulin, a
syringe and needles.

225
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,100
Alexander. Alexander, come here.

226
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:12,038
Insulin?

227
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:17,110
For what, insulin? My
lady's not diabetic.

228
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:25,919
Three weeks later, Sunny's
lying unconscious

229
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:29,823
in a freezing bathroom with her
nightgown hiked over her waist.

230
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,192
If I was on that jury, I
would've voted to convict.

231
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,662
Then you're taking the case?

232
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:37,864
Reminds me of my Hitler dream.

233
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:42,669
Hitler calls up, he's
alive, needs a lawyer.

234
00:18:42,836 --> 00:18:46,272
I say "Sure. Come on over."

235
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:49,676
Then I have to decide do I take
the case or do I kill him?

236
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,012
You? No question.

237
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:54,647
- I would take the case.
- Then kill him.

238
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:58,719
I'm a maniac. I need someone
with your judgement,

239
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:00,120
someone to watch what I'm doing

240
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:02,789
and occasionally remind
me about the law.

241
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:04,691
When can I see the transcripts?

242
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:08,695
You're a former prosecutor,
conservative. We agree on nothing.

243
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:10,196
But you're smarter
than Rhode Island DA.

244
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,366
If I can beat your arguments,
I can destroy his.

245
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,702
Look, Rhode Island is the most
corrupt state in the country.

246
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:16,903
Everything is political.

247
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:18,972
I don't think that way. You do.

248
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:20,781
I have to see the big
picture. I can't

249
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,375
afford to immerse myself in facts.

250
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:24,410
But we must know the facts.

251
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,880
Out of all my ex-students,
no one can assimilate

252
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:28,715
information as quickly as you two.

253
00:19:28,882 --> 00:19:30,784
I agree with that assessment.

254
00:19:35,922 --> 00:19:38,892
- You're out of your mind.
- I only have 45 days to file.

255
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,927
I can't do it without you.

256
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:44,230
Look, Sarah, I know you
don't wanna come back...

257
00:19:44,264 --> 00:19:46,266
Is this strictly professional?

258
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,739
It better be.

259
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:56,076
That's wonderful. I want the best
people in the world on our side,

260
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,944
the most prestigious experts.

261
00:19:57,978 --> 00:20:00,747
Nobel prize-winning scientists,

262
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:02,348
some of your
colleagues at Harvard.

263
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:06,019
Wait a minute, Claus. We got
a little problem, okay?

264
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:08,755
People like that,
we can't control.

265
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,424
They find one incriminating fact,
they'll tell the whole world.

266
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:15,295
I'm not afraid, Alan. Let the
chips fall where they may.

267
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,430
That's what an innocent
man would say.

268
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:19,766
I know.

269
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,441
That just came for you, Daddy.

270
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:32,779
My daughter Cosima.
She never doubted me.

271
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:34,447
She loves Alex and Ala dearly.

272
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,517
Siding with me has cost
her their affections.

273
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:43,756
I don't know what I would've done.

274
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:50,595
Okay, look, I said I didn't
want to hear your story

275
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,898
but I do need some information.

276
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:54,434
Of course.

277
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,003
Okay, I gather though the
older children denied

278
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:59,072
Sunny had a problem
with pills and alcohol.

279
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:00,841
Spectacular understatement.

280
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,475
So there must be somebody
who saw it, right?

281
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:04,244
Some witness, somebody
somewhere, a friend?

282
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:05,812
- You want affidavits?
- Yes, I do.

283
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:07,814
- I'll get them.
- You'll get them.

284
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,317
You should also know, the drugs

285
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:11,084
prescribed for me
were taken by Sunny.

286
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,819
That's a lot of drugs, boss.

287
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:14,254
But the prosecution's allegation

288
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,789
that I knew about
syringes, injections,

289
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:19,592
totally accurate.

290
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,929
Sunny and I used to give ourselves
B12 injections in the late '60s.

291
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:23,964
It's quite the fad in London.

292
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:25,832
Can I explain something to you?

293
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:29,035
The less I know from you,
the more options I have.

294
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:30,470
When you tell me "the truth",

295
00:21:30,503 --> 00:21:32,346
you limit me to a
defence that lines

296
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:33,840
up with what you have to say.

297
00:21:33,974 --> 00:21:37,343
But isn't the truth the
simplest way, Alan?

298
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:39,911
I mean, why did I stay all day at

299
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:42,983
Sunny's side without
calling a doctor?

300
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:46,352
Because Sunny detested doctors.

301
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:49,322
If we called one without her
approval, she went berserk.

302
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:52,859
Once she broke her hip and didn't
go to hospital for two full days.

303
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:54,294
Claus, did you hear
what I just said?

304
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:56,863
Of course. Did you hear
the judge sentence me?

305
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,000
Sorry. 30 years is a
pretty stiff sentence.

306
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,367
Twice trying to murder one's wife,

307
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:04,370
anything less would be monstrous.

308
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:08,508
But for a man like myself,
who did nothing...

309
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:16,883
What I wanted to ask
if we lose the appeal,

310
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,921
will I have the chance
later to set my

311
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:23,156
affairs in order before
I'm incarcerated?

312
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:25,108
In Europe, a gentleman
is given the

313
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:27,027
opportunity to end
things properly.

314
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:32,642
Come on, Claus.

315
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:36,036
We are each the keeper
of our own soul, Alan.

316
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:41,407
Okay, two big problems.

317
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:44,610
The case against him
is very strong,

318
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:47,047
and probably more important
the legal conviction

319
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,016
isn't the only conviction
that we got to reverse.

320
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,686
The more dangerous conviction
is the absolute certainty

321
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,589
of the American people
that Claus is guilty.

322
00:22:56,622 --> 00:23:00,293
Finding grounds for reversal
won't be enough here.

323
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:02,528
Judges on the Rhode
Island Supreme Court

324
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:04,988
will have to go home
to their spouses

325
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,967
and explain why they reversed.

326
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,234
To get them to do that,

327
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,303
we have to completely obliterate

328
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,639
every single aspect
of the state's case.

329
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:16,409
Destroy both the medical
case and their witnesses,

330
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:20,947
so the judges have no
possible way to affirm.

331
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,950
Total victory, or we
are dead in the water.

332
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:26,212
Now, I assume that
you've all had an

333
00:23:26,213 --> 00:23:28,621
opportunity to look
at the transcripts.

334
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,556
First impressions? Yeah, Minnie.

335
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,959
I think this whole thing stinks.

336
00:23:33,093 --> 00:23:35,962
I think Claus von Bulow stinks.

337
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:39,332
He's obviously guilty of
something pretty despicable,

338
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,067
and, if we free him,

339
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:45,471
we become partners in his crime,
accessories after the fact.

340
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,383
I'm really shocked,
with your record

341
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,109
defending the poor and oppressed,

342
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:51,177
that you've taken this case.

343
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:57,250
I won't have anything
to do with it.

344
00:23:57,283 --> 00:24:02,122
And I hope my fellow students
won't, either. Goodbye.

345
00:24:02,155 --> 00:24:05,558
My I exercise my First Amendment
right to free speech?

346
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,663
If lawyers only defended
innocent clients,

347
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:12,698
there'd be ten defence lawyers
in the entire country

348
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:15,001
and none of you would
be able to find a job.

349
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:17,637
Why help guilty people get off?

350
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:21,541
Oh, you're sure he's
guilty? 100% sure?

351
00:24:21,574 --> 00:24:26,179
He had a lawyer. He had a
trial. He was convicted.

352
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:28,389
Are you sure he had a fair trial?

353
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,390
Come on.

354
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:32,618
It's the basis of the
whole legal system.

355
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:36,289
Everyone gets a defence.

356
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:38,412
So the system is there for the one

357
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,993
innocent person who
was falsely accused.

358
00:24:42,662 --> 00:24:47,533
Okay, look. Say it's you. Okay?

359
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:52,038
You decide... You decide
to get a divorce.

360
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:53,806
You're gonna divorce your husband.

361
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,510
A week later, you're accused
of molesting your son.

362
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:00,480
Oh, no, don't give me that look.

363
00:25:00,513 --> 00:25:02,482
Stuff like this
happens all the time.

364
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:06,152
Suddenly, you're
alone. You hate it.

365
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:12,358
It's a nightmare. Everyone
assumes that you are guilty.

366
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:16,362
Even the postman is beginning
to look at you a little funny.

367
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:19,199
You only got one person
who believes in you.

368
00:25:19,232 --> 00:25:24,070
There's only one person you
can trust, your lawyer.

369
00:25:24,104 --> 00:25:29,075
Yeah, okay. So, someone's
got to defend Claus.

370
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,144
But why you? Why us?

371
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:35,081
Look, you're my student.
You have a choice.

372
00:25:35,248 --> 00:25:36,726
You don't have to do anything you

373
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:38,384
don't want to. That
is your choice.

374
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:41,087
The reason I take cases

375
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:43,189
and here I'm unlike
most other lawyers,

376
00:25:43,223 --> 00:25:46,092
who are not professors and
therefore have to make a living

377
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:49,395
I take cases because
I get pissed off.

378
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:53,099
And I am pissed off here.

379
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:58,771
The family hired a private
prosecutor. Unacceptable.

380
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:02,108
They conducted a private search.

381
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:04,377
Now, we let them get
away with that,

382
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,712
rich people won't go
to the cops any more.

383
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:08,114
You know what they're gonna do?

384
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:12,118
They're gonna get their own
lawyers to collect evidence.

385
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:15,321
And then they are going
to choose which evidence

386
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:17,890
they feel like passing
on to the DA.

387
00:26:17,923 --> 00:26:21,627
And the next victim isn't
gonna be rich like von Bulow,

388
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:24,130
but is gonna be some
poor schnook in Detroit

389
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:28,268
who can't afford or can't
find a decent lawyer.

390
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,173
I think it's a little
more complicated

391
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:39,512
than your simple
moral superiority.

392
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:43,149
No?

393
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:45,495
I agree von Bulow is
guilty, but that's

394
00:26:45,496 --> 00:26:47,620
the fun. I mean,
that's the challenge.

395
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,555
See? Now, there is a lawyer.

396
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:54,327
- What?
- I have Mr Von Bulow for you.

397
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,529
Okay, put him on.

398
00:26:56,562 --> 00:26:59,135
Alan, a rather unsavoury character

399
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,934
called David Marriott
contacted me,

400
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:04,471
claiming to have
information about a

401
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,772
drug delivery at Clarendon Court.

402
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:09,442
- Okay. Where does he live?
- Somewhere in Wakefield.

403
00:27:09,475 --> 00:27:12,178
Okay, we'll get on it.

404
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:16,182
Tom, I want you to get
a private investigator

405
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:19,852
to dig into a David Marriott,
lives in Wakefield.

406
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:23,356
Okay. How are we
gonna win this case?

407
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,191
The judge made lots of mistakes.

408
00:27:25,358 --> 00:27:27,960
Judges always make mistakes.
How are we gonna win?

409
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,963
All right, one issue leaps up.
This lawyer, Brillhoffer,

410
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:33,366
interviewed Alex,
Maria, everybody.

411
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:35,201
He was the first person
to hear their stories.

412
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:36,870
He took notes and used those notes

413
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:38,504
at trial against a
defence witness.

414
00:27:38,538 --> 00:27:40,540
But the defence never
saw the notes.

415
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:42,642
The judge wouldn't
let us have them.

416
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:44,977
It somehow seems like sufficient
grounds. It's perfect Brady.

417
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,481
Okay, fine. Why don't you draft a
letter, writing to Brillhoffer,

418
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:51,317
asking him very nicely
to send us his notes?

419
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:54,522
Yeah, right. He'll
fax them right over.

420
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:55,655
Yeah, right.

421
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:57,990
We could win on this issue
alone and he knows it.

422
00:27:58,023 --> 00:27:59,825
You know it, I know it.

423
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:01,661
Just make sure he knows it.

424
00:28:01,694 --> 00:28:04,897
- Now, Nancy and Dobbs.
- Yes?

425
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,408
They're going to attack
the medical testimony.

426
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,504
Our Rhode Island counsel,
Peter Macintosh,

427
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:14,240
he will analyse the
state supreme court.

428
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:16,542
I think the rest of us should
begin dissecting the transcript.

429
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:19,011
Errors, inconsistencies.
Anything unusual.

430
00:28:19,044 --> 00:28:21,289
Okay, great. Now
remember, most cases

431
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,416
are won in the
field, not in court.

432
00:28:25,885 --> 00:28:27,219
Minnie?

433
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:30,423
You wanna work with Sarah on this?

434
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:34,660
- You may learn something.
- Come on, Minnie.

435
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:36,862
Minnie.

436
00:28:36,896 --> 00:28:39,231
Please? Come on.

437
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:42,735
Of course I don't
trust David Marriott.

438
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:44,270
I don't know David Marriott.

439
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:45,604
But if he knew Alex
von Auersberg...

440
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:47,440
You're crazy. I don't know
who you think you are.

441
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:49,275
Perry Mason?

442
00:28:49,442 --> 00:28:51,577
Let our private investigator
interview this jerk.

443
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:53,913
It's stupid, it's arrogant,
and it's unprofessional.

444
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:57,049
- It's fun.
- Fun? This guy is a sleaze.

445
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:58,784
You don't know what
he's gonna try.

446
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:00,686
What, is he gonna shoot me?

447
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:02,922
Come on, I'm from Brooklyn.

448
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:12,298
Okay I'll stand by the window
every ten minutes, okay?

449
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:13,999
That way you can know I'm safe.

450
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:20,373
I had this friend, Gilbert
Jackson. Interior decorator.

451
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:24,344
Flaming queen, but a
very excellent guy.

452
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:29,281
He introduced me to
Alex von Auersberg.

453
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:32,318
Sure it was Alex?

454
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:35,355
We had dinner a few times, drinks.

455
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,557
All I knew, Alex
was some rich kid.

456
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:43,763
So sometimes, this is
like summer of '77

457
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:46,366
I'd motor to Newport
for some R and R.

458
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,901
Gilbert asked me to
bring Alex a package.

459
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:54,106
I figured interior
decoration. Maybe drapes.

460
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:56,842
Like six times. So I'd call Alex.

461
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:58,678
How did you get his phone number?

462
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,679
From Gilbert.

463
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,648
- You still have it?
- Maybe.

464
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:05,651
I'm that kind of guy.

465
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:32,712
Here.

466
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:42,688
One night, I got curious.
Opened the package.

467
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:46,158
Fucking pharmacy, man.

468
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:49,495
Needles, syringes, white powder,

469
00:30:49,529 --> 00:30:53,833
nice selection of pills,
Demerol... Like a drug store.

470
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:58,838
You delivered, drugs six
times and didn't know it?

471
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:05,711
Stupid, huh? Then
Gilbert asked me again.

472
00:31:06,712 --> 00:31:08,047
I couldn't say no, but this time

473
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,417
I made Alex open the
package in front of me.

474
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:13,419
Voila.

475
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:17,923
I go, "Awful lot of
pharmaceuticals for one person."

476
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:21,894
He goes, "Oh, I give some to my
mum to keep her off my back."

477
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:27,433
A few weeks later, Gilbert
gets mistaken for a softball.

478
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,535
Two guys bash his head in.

479
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:32,538
Alex calls me, totally urinary.

480
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:34,206
Will the cops find
his phone number

481
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:37,443
and fuck up his trust
fund or something?

482
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:43,949
Well, that's the fat. That's
the skinny. You like it?

483
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:48,454
You traffic with drug
dealers and drag queens,

484
00:31:48,488 --> 00:31:51,457
you have a part-time job,
you ride in rented limos.

485
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:53,459
All in all, I would have
to say you're probably

486
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:56,128
the least impressive
witness I've ever seen.

487
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,030
Wait a minute.

488
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,869
You think I'm scum, don't you?

489
00:32:05,104 --> 00:32:07,006
Blow it out your ass.

490
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:11,443
You want a witness to
back me up? I'll get one.

491
00:32:12,545 --> 00:32:16,448
And hey, maybe I'll see
you at the Celtics, huh?

492
00:32:28,561 --> 00:32:32,498
I am not going to let them execute
you. You're not gonna die.

493
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:34,721
Look, Johnny, this
is gonna be a lot

494
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:36,969
easier on you if you
don't cry, okay?

495
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:40,773
I know your brother's hysterical.

496
00:32:40,806 --> 00:32:43,509
Number one, they always set
a date for the execution,

497
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:45,711
and they always postpone it.

498
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:48,087
He's great when he's
like this, huh?

499
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:49,088
That's right.

500
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:51,617
I just wish he had something
left for those around him.

501
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:52,885
Why are you talking
to me about money?

502
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:54,119
Did I ever ask you about money?

503
00:32:54,153 --> 00:32:56,188
Anyway, it's nice to
have you back here.

504
00:32:58,658 --> 00:33:00,292
Say hello to your brother.

505
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,027
Right. Okay.

506
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,504
Okay, who's got what?

507
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:15,975
Yeah.

508
00:33:16,008 --> 00:33:17,242
Maria's testimony.

509
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:20,546
She says Sunny did take
Valium prescribed for Claus.

510
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,081
Hey, score one for von Bulow.

511
00:33:22,114 --> 00:33:24,550
And, this Jamie
Smather prescription?

512
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:25,718
Who's Jamie Smather?

513
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:28,688
300-pound red-headed hooker
in pigtails and white boots.

514
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:31,056
She supplied Claus with Valium.

515
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,059
He had a gorgeous mistress
and went to an ugly whore?

516
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,929
You know, there are some things
even mistresses won't do.

517
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:41,601
- Like what?
- I am not telling.

518
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:47,940
Anyway, Maria swears she first saw
this Jamie Smather prescription

519
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:51,877
February 14th, and then
again February 28th.

520
00:33:51,911 --> 00:33:52,911
So?

521
00:33:52,912 --> 00:33:54,914
It wasn't prescribed
till the 28th.

522
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:57,750
You're not suggesting she's lying?

523
00:33:57,783 --> 00:33:59,585
Okay, how about Maria's
insulin? For what insulin?

524
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:00,652
Anything more on that?

525
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:01,821
Not yet.

526
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:06,158
Something about that bothers me.

527
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:10,562
Okay, who's next?
Brillhoffer wrote back.

528
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:14,233
He's very attached to his notes.

529
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:21,641
"I am satisfied that there is not
a scrap of paper in my files

530
00:34:21,674 --> 00:34:25,077
"that might even arguably
be viewed as exculpatory."

531
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,110
English translation?

532
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:28,313
He says he doesn't have
anything that'd help us.

533
00:34:31,116 --> 00:34:33,619
- You with me?
- Pay dirt.

534
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:35,888
- What's pay dirt?
- He's a lawyer.

535
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:38,758
If he really didn't have
anything, he'd give it to us.

536
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,465
But there's something
there, and he's

537
00:34:40,466 --> 00:34:42,227
gonna fight like hell
to hold on to it.

538
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:46,398
I will bet my fee that no one
remembered seeing insulin

539
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:48,634
until after the lab
report came back.

540
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:51,804
- So you're suggesting...
- Memory enhancement.

541
00:34:51,837 --> 00:34:54,106
- It might be more than that.
- Possibly.

542
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:59,645
- A frame-up.
- You mean, by the kids?

543
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,914
Where are you getting all this?
From Brillhoffer's letter?

544
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:03,415
Pure deduction.

545
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:06,293
A good lawyer is
part psychiatrist,

546
00:35:06,294 --> 00:35:07,953
detective, logician.

547
00:35:08,937 --> 00:35:09,937
A great lawyer...

548
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:11,657
Never would have taken this case.

549
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:17,129
If there's nothing more,
has anybody read this?

550
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:21,667
It's an interview
with Truman Capote.

551
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:24,382
He says, when she
was 19, Sunny von

552
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:27,106
Bulow taught him how
to inject drugs.

553
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:28,340
Let me see that.

554
00:35:30,976 --> 00:35:33,879
Well, well, well. The
famous professor.

555
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:37,216
Alan, I'd like to introduce my
new girlfriend, Andrea Reynolds.

556
00:35:37,249 --> 00:35:39,672
I'm not his girlfriend.
I'm his saviour.

557
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:40,686
Perfectly true.

558
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,188
Two days after the trial
ended, we fell in love.

559
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:45,958
It was really very, very dramatic.

560
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:48,694
Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, come on.

561
00:35:48,761 --> 00:35:52,197
Since then, I've devoted my
life to clearing his name.

562
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:54,233
I made him hire you.

563
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:57,737
"Get the Jew," I said.

564
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:01,006
Darling...

565
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,976
Can the Jew get down to business?

566
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:07,479
We've got an affidavit. Smythe.

567
00:36:07,512 --> 00:36:10,281
Mrs Ruth Smythe gave
us an affidavit

568
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:12,451
corroborating Truman Capote.

569
00:36:13,285 --> 00:36:15,187
I have affidavits, too.

570
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:20,726
Newport people. They
describe Sunny taking pills,

571
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,728
getting drunk and falling down,

572
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:26,431
thumping into doorways, smearing
lipstick all over her face.

573
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:29,034
- Not a very pretty picture.
- She did it, didn't she?

574
00:36:29,902 --> 00:36:31,370
Don't be a priss.

575
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:35,741
- Sunny was a lovely woman.
- Spoiled rotten.

576
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:38,410
Yes, but lovely. Till she drank.

577
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:43,783
Two drinks, and she became...
Nasty, irrational.

578
00:36:43,816 --> 00:36:45,751
All women are irrational, darling.

579
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:47,019
Did we mention the priest?

580
00:36:47,052 --> 00:36:48,854
Oh.

581
00:36:48,888 --> 00:36:51,078
Oh. Marriott apparently
confided in a

582
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:53,325
priest, who's consented
to talk to us.

583
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:58,764
Father Capello from Providence.

584
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,768
A priest?

585
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:04,770
Oh, a priest is the ideal witness.

586
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:05,938
It's like getting the word of God.

587
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:08,107
I checked. God is unavailable.

588
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:12,277
If the priest comes through,

589
00:37:12,311 --> 00:37:15,047
and we can get documentation
on Sunny's drug use,

590
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,449
then self-injection may
be a plausible theory.

591
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:19,051
There's no insulin in this case.

592
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:21,220
Yeah, but people do use insulin.

593
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:23,122
They use it for dieting. It's
not a prescription drug.

594
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:24,824
Sunny was concerned
about her weight.

595
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:28,360
Maybe, but believe me, Alan,
there's no insulin here.

596
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:35,767
Really? How can you be so sure?

597
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:46,734
You realise, with this case, I'm

598
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:50,015
looking for evidence
to exonerate you.

599
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:54,954
But, at the same time, I'm also
wondering what really happened.

600
00:37:55,955 --> 00:37:58,790
- Who you are.
- Who would you like me to be?

601
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,364
Your mother's death,
what happened?

602
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:09,835
I believe she had a heart problem.

603
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:12,838
Really? The rumour in
England is you killed her.

604
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:14,626
Hey, wait a minute,
Alan. Statute of

605
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,475
limitations ran out
on that years ago.

606
00:38:16,508 --> 00:38:19,144
There's rumours also
that I killed my aunt.

607
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:23,849
And that I'm a necrophiliac

608
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,617
who injected Sunny with insulin

609
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:28,253
so that I could have
my way with her.

610
00:38:29,088 --> 00:38:30,322
Please.

611
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,860
Your mother's death wasn't
recorded for five full days.

612
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,361
True.

613
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:39,999
Where were you during that time?

614
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,566
In the flat.

615
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,168
Where the body was?

616
00:38:50,375 --> 00:38:52,444
My mother is my own business.

617
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,854
Did Claus drive me crazy?
Even I don't know.

618
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:07,859
But it's true that I took
up to 24 laxatives daily,

619
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:11,330
popped aspirin like M&M's,

620
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:14,399
smoked three packs
of cigarettes a day,

621
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:17,336
had a problem with alcohol,

622
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:20,039
took Valium and Seconal frequently

623
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:22,908
and consumed large
quantities of sweets,

624
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:26,345
despite a medical
condition, hypoglycaemia,

625
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:28,380
which made them hazardous.

626
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:31,883
As for my state of mind...

627
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:41,260
I had not had sex with
my husband for years.

628
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:47,366
My schedule was I woke at 9.30,

629
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:50,535
did a little exercise
and shopping,

630
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:53,199
and returned to bed
at 3 o'clock for

631
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,474
the remainder of the afternoon.

632
00:39:55,507 --> 00:40:00,946
I liked to be in bed. I didn't
much like anything else.

633
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:09,254
Hold on here, will you?

634
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:28,940
- Come in.
- Alan.

635
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:32,611
Welcome to my humble law firm.

636
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:37,249
In the kitchen, our
insulin-on-the-needle team.

637
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:39,985
They're cooking up
some surprise for us.

638
00:40:44,723 --> 00:40:47,226
This is our Brillhoffer
notes team.

639
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,995
Mr von Bulow.

640
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:53,765
Where are the paper
towels? Ask Sarah.

641
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:55,734
Sarah used to live here.

642
00:40:57,136 --> 00:41:00,039
This, I guess he was up all night.

643
00:41:08,313 --> 00:41:11,550
This sort of commune, you
do it on every case?

644
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:18,023
Never before. 38 days to write 100
pages. Only way to get it done.

645
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:21,126
Here's the black-bag team.
Illegal-search team.

646
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,522
My son Elon lost his
room. Well, actually

647
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:36,041
this is another case
that you're paying for.

648
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:40,279
- And this is my team.
- You wish.

649
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:44,483
I can't find the damn thing.

650
00:41:44,516 --> 00:41:45,554
Hi. I'm Sarah.

651
00:41:45,555 --> 00:41:48,019
Well, a very lovely Sarah you are.

652
00:41:49,254 --> 00:41:52,691
- Does that really work?
- Flattery? Absolutely.

653
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:57,829
Like Chinese food?

654
00:41:57,862 --> 00:42:00,132
What do you give a wife
who has everything?

655
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:04,035
An injection of insulin.

656
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:09,708
How... Ah, my prawns.

657
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:13,044
How can one define
a fear of insulin?

658
00:42:14,446 --> 00:42:16,047
Claus-trophobia.

659
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:26,258
Is there anything more you can
tell us about Alexandra Isles?

660
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,455
Is it true that she
gave you a deadline

661
00:42:28,456 --> 00:42:30,295
of Christmas 1979 to be together?

662
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:34,233
Ah, not really. No, she knew I
was looking for full-time work.

663
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,701
I worked for JP Getty in London.

664
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:38,414
Alexandra assumed
that, when you did

665
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:40,139
find a job, you'd
marry her, correct?

666
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,607
Oh, she assumed it.

667
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:46,145
How about when she testified,
did you get the sense

668
00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:47,879
that she wanted to
get back together?

669
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:50,715
Very much so. In fact, at
the trial, she said...

670
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:54,686
I loved him, but I was still
caught up in my own anger.

671
00:42:56,755 --> 00:42:58,823
And I'm sorry I acted
that way then.

672
00:42:59,758 --> 00:43:01,626
I loved him then. I was angry.

673
00:43:03,262 --> 00:43:06,131
Let me ask you this.
Maybe you can't answer.

674
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:07,832
Do you still love him?

675
00:43:08,867 --> 00:43:10,369
I don't know.

676
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:13,738
That means yes, doesn't
it? It would seem so.

677
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:16,020
In fact, after the
trial, she wrote

678
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:18,143
me a letter saying so explicitly.

679
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:24,149
A very passionate letter.
Passionate and jealous.

680
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:28,520
But that was the relationship from
the outset. That was Alexandra.

681
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:30,789
She was your love slave.

682
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:39,331
Ah.

683
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:44,303
Well, I think now I'll have my own
individual order of ginger prawns.

684
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,306
Waiter.

685
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:51,142
Three weeks before her final coma,
Sunny overdosed on aspirin.

686
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:53,278
Can you tell us
anything about that?

687
00:43:53,312 --> 00:43:55,680
No one maintained I had
anything to do with that, Alan.

688
00:43:55,714 --> 00:43:58,317
No. Of course not. I'm
asking you what happened.

689
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:01,320
Well, Sunny had been unwell.

690
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,496
- Are you all right?
- Ah, just a bit dizzy.

691
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:16,868
Well, if you're dizzy,
don't go wandering.

692
00:44:32,584 --> 00:44:33,752
Sunny?

693
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:39,991
Oh, my God. Come on, my darling.

694
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:43,362
Now, you're all right. Come on,
put your arm around my shoulder.

695
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:47,532
No, you're all right. Come on,
we'll get you back into bed.

696
00:44:49,401 --> 00:44:52,537
- Something happened to my head.
- You're all right.

697
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:56,508
It's just a little cut.

698
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,977
Come on, let's get you lying down.

699
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:04,215
There you are.

700
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:09,220
There.

701
00:45:12,724 --> 00:45:15,694
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No.

702
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:19,298
No, I don't want a doctor.
Just... I don't want a doctor.

703
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:22,667
I just wanna be left alone.

704
00:45:24,068 --> 00:45:27,572
I wanna be left alone with
all those beautiful letters.

705
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:28,873
What did you do
with those letters?

706
00:45:28,907 --> 00:45:32,377
Why did you write those letters?

707
00:45:32,411 --> 00:45:35,380
Later the doctor said we
needn't have gone to hospital,

708
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:37,482
but I wasn't going
to take any chances.

709
00:45:37,516 --> 00:45:39,618
Why did she take so much aspirin?

710
00:45:39,651 --> 00:45:42,002
Oh, Sunny always
took aspirin. She'd

711
00:45:42,003 --> 00:45:44,289
been taking a lot
for several days.

712
00:45:44,323 --> 00:45:47,492
- That's not what our doctor said.
- Dr Lucus Lupardus,

713
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:50,595
chief forensic toxicologist,
Suffolk County,

714
00:45:50,629 --> 00:45:52,848
says people who take
large amounts of

715
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:55,300
aspirin every day never
reach that level.

716
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:59,304
He also said the average blood
level in cases of death is 60.

717
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:01,406
Hers was 90. So...

718
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,275
So, it was obviously
a suicide attempt.

719
00:46:05,344 --> 00:46:06,911
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

720
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:08,171
Why?

721
00:46:08,172 --> 00:46:11,850
Alan, do they all want
to be prosecutors?

722
00:46:14,686 --> 00:46:16,287
We're waiting.

723
00:46:19,558 --> 00:46:21,626
Well, I presume she was unhappy.

724
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:31,069
How about we all finish up
and go back to the house?

725
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:36,608
We're not gonna win this
on a technicality. Peter?

726
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:38,643
I've read every case in
the last seven years

727
00:46:38,677 --> 00:46:41,012
where the Rhode Island
Supreme Court reversed.

728
00:46:41,045 --> 00:46:42,347
They don't like to make new law,

729
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:44,783
they don't like to discuss
broad legal issues.

730
00:46:44,816 --> 00:46:47,686
When they do reverse, the
grounds are technical,

731
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:49,954
but the reason seems to be

732
00:46:49,988 --> 00:46:52,657
they suspect a convicted
defendant may be innocent.

733
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:56,628
Okay, everybody get that?

734
00:46:56,661 --> 00:47:01,500
True or not, we've gotta convince
the judges that you are innocent.

735
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:05,804
Claus, now I do wanna hear
your side of the story.

736
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:10,108
With pleasure. Innocence has
always been my position.

737
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,416
First coma, what preceded it?

738
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:21,820
Well, Sunny loved Christmas.

739
00:47:21,853 --> 00:47:24,923
It was her favourite
season, really.

740
00:47:24,956 --> 00:47:28,059
You see, what you must
understand about Sunny

741
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:31,396
is that she loved giving
more than anything else.

742
00:47:31,463 --> 00:47:34,866
♪ Peace on earth and mercy mild

743
00:47:34,899 --> 00:47:37,402
♪ God and sinners reconciled

744
00:47:37,436 --> 00:47:41,406
Each year, she always made a
big bowl of fresh eggnog.

745
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,775
On that year, she
drank a lot of it.

746
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:46,978
How much? 10 or 12 glasses.

747
00:47:48,547 --> 00:47:51,416
With her hypoglycaemia?

748
00:47:51,483 --> 00:47:52,917
She didn't always drink like that?

749
00:47:52,951 --> 00:47:56,421
Never. She never touched
alcohol at all,

750
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:59,390
except on social occasions
to overcome her shyness

751
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:01,793
or when she was upset.

752
00:48:02,894 --> 00:48:05,697
This was not a social occasion?

753
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:10,168
No. We'd been discussing
divorce all afternoon.

754
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:32,624
This whole subject of your
work coming between us,

755
00:48:35,026 --> 00:48:37,929
isn't it just a pretext, when
the real subject is her?

756
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,431
Certainly not.

757
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:45,870
I'm thinking of redecorating
this whole fucking house.

758
00:48:48,272 --> 00:48:50,475
Then she knew about Alexandra.

759
00:48:51,643 --> 00:48:53,778
- Yes.
- How did she find out?

760
00:48:56,615 --> 00:48:58,483
I...

761
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:00,685
I told her the previous summer.

762
00:49:21,806 --> 00:49:23,241
Thank you.

763
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:34,953
Oh, I've been meaning to mention,

764
00:49:34,986 --> 00:49:40,491
our understanding about my
extracurricular activities.

765
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:46,731
I've been involved with
someone who falls outside

766
00:49:46,765 --> 00:49:48,833
the parameters of our agreement.

767
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:49,867
Really?

768
00:49:49,868 --> 00:49:52,671
Someone peripherally
in our circle.

769
00:49:54,338 --> 00:49:57,175
Billy Botsky's daughter,
Alexandra Isles.

770
00:49:59,711 --> 00:50:00,912
Well...

771
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:06,785
That must be better for you than
what you've had to put up with.

772
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,856
You're referring
to the call girls.

773
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:17,528
Yes. I mean, that is where you've
gone previously, isn't it?

774
00:50:18,229 --> 00:50:19,598
Yes, it is.

775
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:26,938
And isn't this better? Or is Billy
Botsky's daughter a call girl too?

776
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:31,209
This is much better.

777
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:41,686
That was what? July, August?

778
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,988
Now it's Christmas
time, and you were

779
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:45,957
still squabbling over Alexandra?

780
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,593
No, we were fighting
about my work.

781
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:49,928
Sunny was...

782
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,366
Well, by the evening, she'd
drunk so much eggnog

783
00:50:55,399 --> 00:50:58,102
that I had to help her
into the bedroom.

784
00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:02,907
Time for bed, darling.

785
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:09,580
There we are.

786
00:51:15,787 --> 00:51:18,623
Please don't hold my arm.

787
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:21,125
Darling, you know when
you get like this.

788
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:25,630
Do you remember? You
fell and broke your hip.

789
00:51:25,697 --> 00:51:27,265
That was years ago.

790
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:31,302
It was two years ago.

791
00:51:52,223 --> 00:51:54,225
Get me a Scotch and soda.

792
00:52:05,236 --> 00:52:07,638
May I at least urinate alone?

793
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:30,161
She runs the water every
time she goes in there.

794
00:52:32,363 --> 00:52:34,799
If she was already soused, why
do you go for the Scotch?

795
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:36,667
Because she asked for it.

796
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:40,671
Sunny got what Sunny wanted.

797
00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:42,707
It's okay.

798
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:14,906
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, darling.

799
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:19,443
- Good night, Claus.
- Good night, Alex.

800
00:53:33,892 --> 00:53:36,294
Hasn't my mother given
us enough money?

801
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:38,763
Claus.

802
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:40,765
That night, we hardly slept.

803
00:53:40,899 --> 00:53:44,035
Your age is perfectly
acceptable to retire.

804
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:46,938
I'm already retired.

805
00:53:46,971 --> 00:53:49,040
I haven't worked
full-time since Getty.

806
00:53:49,073 --> 00:53:52,343
Exactly. It's your ego. You've
never had a career, not really.

807
00:53:53,812 --> 00:53:55,780
I'm going to have one now.

808
00:53:58,249 --> 00:54:00,751
Oh, come on, Sunny.
Your father worked.

809
00:54:02,086 --> 00:54:03,988
Do you want the children
to grow up thinking

810
00:54:04,022 --> 00:54:06,090
a male's place is in a deck chair?

811
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:08,793
Perhaps, you marry me for my
money, then you demand to work.

812
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:10,561
You're the prince of perversion.

813
00:54:10,594 --> 00:54:12,797
I mean, what? Are you trying
to destroy our whole family?

814
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:15,766
Oh, no, of course not.
I simply want some

815
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:19,137
intercourse with the world.

816
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:20,771
Shut up, Pan.

817
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:23,441
Oh, what does it matter?

818
00:54:26,945 --> 00:54:30,781
So, is that it? Another divorce?

819
00:54:33,952 --> 00:54:37,822
Okay. I'll divorce you. I will.

820
00:54:37,956 --> 00:54:41,826
Oh, God. Two-time loser.

821
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:48,266
- I'll divorce everybody.
- I don't want a divorce.

822
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:51,102
I don't want to marry
Billy Botsky's daughter.

823
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,438
I want to stay with you and I want
to work. I need that as a man.

824
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,811
It's hopeless.

825
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:07,986
Oh, God. I need my beauty sleep.

826
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:11,355
Why do you believe it's hopeless
just because it's some...

827
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:53,064
Good night, Claus.

828
00:55:55,033 --> 00:55:57,135
Sunny, you know I love you.

829
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:16,887
Good night.

830
00:56:23,394 --> 00:56:25,396
- Okay, and the next day?
- Well...

831
00:56:27,999 --> 00:56:31,135
Maria's testimony was
wildly exaggerated.

832
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:35,539
Sunny was never moaning.

833
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:37,942
Maybe the occasional slur, but...

834
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:42,146
And Maria shook Sunny.

835
00:56:45,183 --> 00:56:47,952
Nobody ever shook Sunny.

836
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:54,625
What happened when she
became conscious?

837
00:56:54,658 --> 00:56:57,962
After the first coma,
it was kind of absurd.

838
00:56:57,996 --> 00:56:59,930
Everybody was angry at me.

839
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:05,936
Can't you ever leave me alone?

840
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,609
Why did you do it?

841
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:13,978
I would have been better off.

842
00:57:14,145 --> 00:57:15,980
You would have been better off.

843
00:57:16,014 --> 00:57:19,150
What do you want me to say? That
I'm sorry I saved your life?

844
00:57:19,183 --> 00:57:20,284
Yes.

845
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:26,190
Say it.

846
00:57:34,032 --> 00:57:35,966
Of course I'm not sorry.

847
00:57:55,753 --> 00:57:56,987
Claus.

848
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,994
What am I going to do with myself?

849
00:58:10,268 --> 00:58:12,080
When I phoned Alexandra
to tell her what

850
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:13,804
had happened, she
said the same thing.

851
00:58:13,837 --> 00:58:17,575
She said "Why did you do it?
Why did you call the doctor?"

852
00:58:17,608 --> 00:58:20,144
Are you telling me, she
wanted you to let Sunny die?

853
00:58:20,178 --> 00:58:22,746
No, no, no, no, no.

854
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:28,419
It was more "Everybody says
Sunny's such an unhappy woman

855
00:58:30,121 --> 00:58:32,423
and has nothing to live for."

856
00:58:33,691 --> 00:58:36,094
Well, so much for the first coma.

857
00:58:37,428 --> 00:58:41,599
The second, of course, was
much more theatrical.

858
00:58:41,632 --> 00:58:44,268
Theatrical? What is
this, a fucking game?

859
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:47,738
This is life and death. Your
wife is laying in a coma.

860
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:51,175
You don't even make a
pretence at caring, do you?

861
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:53,111
Of course I care, Alan.

862
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:57,648
It's just I don't wear
my heart on my sleeve.

863
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:04,088
Let's call it a night, okay?

864
00:59:04,155 --> 00:59:06,190
Okay, guys, so...

865
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:07,525
As you wish.

866
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:11,495
Three drugs on the needle
amobarbital, Valium, insulin.

867
00:59:13,264 --> 00:59:15,133
We can't all be you, Alan.

868
00:59:23,174 --> 00:59:25,243
Shoot, shoot.

869
00:59:25,276 --> 00:59:27,778
Okay, get a doctor to
prepare five needles.

870
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:32,116
One with nothing, two with
Valium, amobarbital and insulin,

871
00:59:32,283 --> 00:59:34,118
two with just Valium
and amobarbital.

872
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:35,568
We're gonna send them to the same

873
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:37,155
lab that our famous
needle went to.

874
00:59:37,188 --> 00:59:39,323
Let's see if we can get a
false-positive result.

875
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:40,408
If we don't?

876
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:43,261
If we don't, I clean the latrines.

877
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:45,396
Oh, you're not gonna believe this.

878
00:59:45,429 --> 00:59:47,131
David Marriott wants money.

879
00:59:47,165 --> 00:59:48,766
Who doesn't?

880
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,168
I'm afraid, his memory might fail.

881
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:51,535
Well the hell with
him. Forget about him.

882
00:59:51,536 --> 00:59:52,636
Well, he has lost his crummy job,

883
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:56,807
and he is running around trying
to find evidence for us.

884
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,103
Okay, but why don't
we do, what the

885
00:59:58,104 --> 00:59:59,577
government does with
its witnesses, okay?

886
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,145
We'll pay him for his time.

887
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:03,681
- What's his time worth?
- Buck and a half.

888
01:00:04,382 --> 01:00:07,818
Dersh. Your team's on.

889
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,803
Okay, you gonna pass
to me this game?

890
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:10,804
No.

891
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:14,903
Their private investigator
said the needle

892
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:16,760
had a small encrustation
near the tip.

893
01:00:16,794 --> 01:00:19,597
Doctors tell us this is totally
inconsistent with injection.

894
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,632
Okay, so how did it get there?

895
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:24,768
Oh.

896
01:00:24,802 --> 01:00:29,207
If I inject this needle, the
skin acts as a kind of a swab.

897
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,611
It cleans the needle off, leaving
the tip completely free of liquid.

898
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:37,648
But if I just dip the needle into
the liquid, what do you see?

899
01:00:39,317 --> 01:00:42,453
Dry this out, you
have an encrustation.

900
01:00:42,486 --> 01:00:44,188
So it's a frame-up?

901
01:00:44,255 --> 01:00:46,957
It's Desdemona's handkerchief.

902
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,859
My stepchildren
thought I was guilty,

903
01:00:48,892 --> 01:00:52,196
didn't feel they had enough
evidence, so concocted some.

904
01:00:52,363 --> 01:00:54,798
- This should win us the case, no?
- No.

905
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:56,166
We're maybe halfway home.

906
01:00:57,535 --> 01:00:59,970
There's still a lot
of weird stuff.

907
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:02,506
- Did you love Sunny?
- I married her.

908
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:05,676
Of course I loved her.
She was beautiful.

909
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,212
- Rich.
- Why not?

910
01:01:08,246 --> 01:01:10,514
What I've seen of the
rich, you can have 'em.

911
01:01:10,548 --> 01:01:11,682
I do.

912
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:18,422
The black bag. Was it yours?

913
01:01:20,858 --> 01:01:22,926
Sunny appropriated it.

914
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,903
But to understand that, you must

915
01:01:24,904 --> 01:01:27,331
understand that, after
the first coma,

916
01:01:27,365 --> 01:01:29,600
she went into a complete rage.

917
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:36,396
Where are they? Did you take them?

918
01:01:36,397 --> 01:01:37,675
Certainly not. Take what?

919
01:01:37,708 --> 01:01:39,477
My pills, you moron.

920
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:41,879
Valium, Seconal.

921
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:45,249
You took them, didn't you?

922
01:01:45,383 --> 01:01:47,618
My dear, I've long since
stopped interfering.

923
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:50,254
Well, who? My children
wouldn't dare.

924
01:01:51,955 --> 01:01:54,592
- Oh, I know who.
- Where are you going?

925
01:02:07,438 --> 01:02:08,606
Maria.

926
01:02:18,482 --> 01:02:20,250
She soon found them.

927
01:02:21,752 --> 01:02:25,289
It's my lovely mother, isn't
it? She's behind all this.

928
01:02:26,357 --> 01:02:30,060
She's in cahoots with Maria.

929
01:02:30,093 --> 01:02:35,833
Well, just because she had all the
money before I had all the money

930
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:38,736
does not mean she's
my lord and master.

931
01:02:38,769 --> 01:02:41,271
Of course not. I am
your lord and master.

932
01:02:42,873 --> 01:02:44,342
Just kidding.

933
01:02:49,447 --> 01:02:52,015
Maria loves me too much.

934
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:56,387
It's unhealthy for her, and
it's certainly no fun for me.

935
01:03:01,992 --> 01:03:03,293
There.

936
01:03:19,076 --> 01:03:22,646
We'll see if that ugly little maid
of mine can sniff this one out.

937
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,393
And what are you going
to do with all that?

938
01:03:35,426 --> 01:03:37,361
I'm not gonna tell you.

939
01:03:37,395 --> 01:03:39,997
I assure you, it's not
gonna be among my affairs.

940
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:45,903
Odd she used that word, "affairs".

941
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:47,810
You realise the
prosecution thinks you

942
01:03:47,811 --> 01:03:49,973
ground up the drugs so
you can inject Sunny.

943
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:53,377
And frankly, this nose-drop
business is pretty far-fetched.

944
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:55,613
But consider the pattern, Alan.

945
01:03:56,714 --> 01:04:00,083
It's public record
that Sunny used drugs.

946
01:04:00,117 --> 01:04:02,853
Her behaviour here
of hiding them in

947
01:04:02,854 --> 01:04:05,589
liquid so that no
one will find them

948
01:04:05,623 --> 01:04:08,392
is your classic alcoholic
buying pints of whiskey

949
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:09,893
and stashing them
all over the house.

950
01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:15,399
You're right. Of course. I mean...

951
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:17,535
I mean, you've always
been right, haven't you?

952
01:04:18,769 --> 01:04:21,572
This is the most dangerous
case I ever worked on.

953
01:04:21,605 --> 01:04:23,648
You find that exhilarating?

954
01:04:23,649 --> 01:04:26,677
No, I do not. I am
breaking every rule.

955
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:29,413
Because the best way to win is
to proclaim your innocence,

956
01:04:29,547 --> 01:04:32,115
and I have never done
that for anybody.

957
01:04:32,149 --> 01:04:34,585
And the problem I got
is I see who you are.

958
01:04:34,618 --> 01:04:37,421
- You'd do anything to win.
- So would you.

959
01:04:37,555 --> 01:04:40,057
Yeah, but you don't
trust the legal system.

960
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:43,927
You're saying I'd manufacture
witnesses, affidavits?

961
01:04:45,629 --> 01:04:49,433
- No, but you would sacrifice me.
- Oh, please, Alan.

962
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:51,683
See, the more I
believe that you are

963
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:53,571
innocent, the more nervous I am.

964
01:04:53,604 --> 01:04:55,827
I go out on a limb for you, you're

965
01:04:55,828 --> 01:04:58,442
proven guilty, I look
like an asshole.

966
01:04:58,476 --> 01:05:01,579
My reputation, my credibility,
my career, destroyed.

967
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:04,922
That's the risk you're
taking, isn't it?

968
01:05:04,923 --> 01:05:05,923
Well, fuck you.

969
01:05:06,784 --> 01:05:08,418
Fuck you, man.

970
01:05:20,631 --> 01:05:22,966
I'm glad we understand
one another.

971
01:05:25,636 --> 01:05:30,107
It's easy to forget all this
is about me, lying here.

972
01:05:31,509 --> 01:05:34,478
To most of you, my
name means "coma".

973
01:05:34,612 --> 01:05:38,181
My second marriage means
"attempted murder".

974
01:05:38,215 --> 01:05:41,084
Everything that came before,
everything beautiful,

975
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:44,087
does not exist in the public mind.

976
01:05:44,121 --> 01:05:47,991
No one thinks of how I loved
my children. Look at Cosima.

977
01:05:49,026 --> 01:05:52,095
And Alex, of course. And Ala.

978
01:05:52,129 --> 01:05:54,865
And certainly no one
cares about Claus,

979
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:57,835
the way he was when I
fell in love with him.

980
01:05:57,868 --> 01:06:01,271
When Claus and I first met, I was
married to the dashing young

981
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:03,510
Prince Alfred Eduard Friederich

982
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:06,143
Vincenz Martin Maria
von Auersberg.

983
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:12,950
It was 1964, seven years
into my first marriage.

984
01:06:18,656 --> 01:06:23,961
It seems that my first husband,
Alfie, as he was called,

985
01:06:23,994 --> 01:06:28,165
had vowed to be unfaithful with
every pretty girl in Europe.

986
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,235
He was having quite a success.

987
01:06:34,572 --> 01:06:38,842
And so... I was
unfaithful with Claus.

988
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:52,189
Psst.

989
01:06:57,728 --> 01:06:59,529
Wildly unfaithful.

990
01:07:01,699 --> 01:07:03,066
Happy memories.

991
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:14,211
But it's not the passion
I remember most.

992
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:17,915
It's the tenderness.

993
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:26,089
Good God, what's that?

994
01:07:26,123 --> 01:07:28,091
Just one of Frank's pets.

995
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:33,597
Oh, my God.

996
01:07:49,913 --> 01:07:51,081
Come on, silly.

997
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:54,584
I never liked people
much, not as a rule.

998
01:07:56,153 --> 01:07:58,588
But Claus was somehow different.

999
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:03,593
Not a normal person, I guess.

1000
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:10,600
It's all right. Do it
again. Give him some more.

1001
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:13,837
Aw.

1002
01:08:23,881 --> 01:08:26,616
One of those things
you never forget.

1003
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:33,023
Of course, now he lives in
my apartment, my bedroom,

1004
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:35,793
my bed.

1005
01:08:36,994 --> 01:08:39,329
Cold, isn't it?

1006
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:42,399
Cold and brutish, and
the way of the world.

1007
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:46,670
Looking at him now, the
issue seems simple.

1008
01:08:47,905 --> 01:08:50,107
Is he the devil?

1009
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:53,243
If so, can the devil get justice?

1010
01:08:54,745 --> 01:09:01,184
And all this legal activity,
is it in Satan's service?

1011
01:09:01,218 --> 01:09:05,889
"Sunny von Bulow was totally
vulnerable to Claus von Bulow?"

1012
01:09:06,824 --> 01:09:08,125
Can't argue with that.

1013
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,695
But it's speculation,
exaggeration.

1014
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:14,664
- You keep working on it.
- Totally inflammatory.

1015
01:09:16,734 --> 01:09:18,869
Okay, good. Let's go over this.

1016
01:09:19,837 --> 01:09:21,171
Okay, we went over it once.

1017
01:09:21,204 --> 01:09:23,206
I just wanting to see if it...

1018
01:09:30,848 --> 01:09:34,117
Oh, shit. What is
this? Illegal search?

1019
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:37,988
A classic technicality, it's
a guilty man's argument.

1020
01:09:38,021 --> 01:09:39,256
Come on, this is different.

1021
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:41,725
Usual Fourth Amendment case,
you're trying to exclude evidence.

1022
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,459
- This is bad for your client.
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.

1023
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,494
Same thing here. Same thing.

1024
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:47,097
No, this search
destroyed evidence.

1025
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:48,932
No fingerprints, no inventory.

1026
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:50,438
Yeah, what's left hurts
Claus, but on the

1027
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:51,735
Brady the state has
an obligation...

1028
01:09:51,902 --> 01:09:53,170
Wait, wait, wait...

1029
01:09:53,203 --> 01:09:55,105
The cops tested the drugs from
the illegal search, right?

1030
01:09:55,138 --> 01:09:57,741
- Yes. Yes.
- And we are saying that that test

1031
01:09:57,775 --> 01:09:59,743
constituted a second
illegal search.

1032
01:09:59,877 --> 01:10:01,687
There are precedents. Walter,
Jacobs and Morgan...

1033
01:10:01,688 --> 01:10:02,746
I know there are precedents.

1034
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:04,614
I know the lawyer is on our
side. I'm not debating that.

1035
01:10:04,615 --> 01:10:06,350
What I'm trying to do...

1036
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:09,019
You're debating me,
personally. Why?

1037
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:13,190
I'm debating strategy, okay?
I'm not debating you.

1038
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:15,759
We're all on the same team. Are
we on the same team? You and I?

1039
01:10:15,926 --> 01:10:17,861
I don't know. We seem to be.

1040
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:19,930
Well, then why don't I feel it?

1041
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:21,531
I thought this was
strictly professional.

1042
01:10:21,564 --> 01:10:23,767
- It was.
- That's bullshit, Alan.

1043
01:10:23,834 --> 01:10:26,136
Loo, I brought you... I asked
you to work on this case

1044
01:10:26,169 --> 01:10:27,771
because I think you
are a good lawyer.

1045
01:10:27,805 --> 01:10:30,273
I think you are a fine lawyer,
too, you are a great lawyer,

1046
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:31,775
but you give everything
you have to the law

1047
01:10:31,909 --> 01:10:33,310
and forget the people
you care about.

1048
01:10:33,343 --> 01:10:36,213
My clients are the people
that I care about.

1049
01:10:36,246 --> 01:10:37,246
Obviously.

1050
01:10:37,247 --> 01:10:38,548
What I care about,
all I care about,

1051
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:43,220
all I fucking care about
is this. This case.

1052
01:10:43,253 --> 01:10:45,317
And making the best
possible appeal

1053
01:10:45,318 --> 01:10:47,324
that we're capable of doing, okay?

1054
01:10:47,357 --> 01:10:49,126
Now, you can make your
argument better, Sarah.

1055
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:51,228
You know that. I know that.

1056
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:55,098
So why don't you just do it
and cut all the bullshit?

1057
01:10:55,132 --> 01:10:57,767
You always have to have
the last word, don't you?

1058
01:11:29,132 --> 01:11:30,233
What?

1059
01:11:32,903 --> 01:11:35,105
We're gonna lose.

1060
01:11:35,138 --> 01:11:39,009
Why do you think this
case fascinates people?

1061
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:42,112
Because one time or other, every
man is driven crazy by his wife,

1062
01:11:42,145 --> 01:11:44,447
and in his secret heart,

1063
01:11:44,481 --> 01:11:47,851
he wants to do exactly
what Claus is accused of.

1064
01:11:47,985 --> 01:11:51,221
Kill her in some sly, silent
way that can't be detected.

1065
01:11:52,155 --> 01:11:54,357
Claus is a scapegoat.

1066
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:57,827
Someone has to suffer for the
sin that we all wanna commit.

1067
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:02,832
Alan, that's ridiculous.

1068
01:12:05,035 --> 01:12:07,104
It's ridiculous. You're right.

1069
01:12:11,008 --> 01:12:12,874
What have you got?

1070
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:16,980
Prosecution's case is
based on a theory.

1071
01:12:17,014 --> 01:12:19,249
The needle in the
bag, plus insulin on

1072
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,484
the needle, plus
insulin in her blood.

1073
01:12:21,518 --> 01:12:23,520
Right, right, right.
Okay, okay, fine.

1074
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:28,926
In Derek, this Rhode Island
Supreme Court, these same judges,

1075
01:12:28,959 --> 01:12:32,595
said that, in a case based
on circumstantial theory,

1076
01:12:34,364 --> 01:12:38,868
the case falls apart if any
part of the theory is weak.

1077
01:12:40,203 --> 01:12:41,641
If there's a weak
link in the train,

1078
01:12:41,642 --> 01:12:43,040
then you throw the
whole chain out?

1079
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:44,574
Exactly.

1080
01:12:46,543 --> 01:12:49,146
Peter, that's good.
That's very good.

1081
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:55,853
- Oh, yeah, this is good.
- Thank you.

1082
01:12:55,886 --> 01:12:56,886
Oh, yeah.

1083
01:12:56,921 --> 01:12:58,521
Wait, wait, what do you
want me to do now?

1084
01:12:58,555 --> 01:13:00,190
What I want you to do?
I want you to find

1085
01:13:00,223 --> 01:13:02,525
as many alternative
theories as possible.

1086
01:13:02,559 --> 01:13:05,262
Hey. Come on. Come on. Come on.
There's only seven days left.

1087
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:13,603
Dersh. I'm sorry, but you'd
better come downstairs.

1088
01:13:15,072 --> 01:13:18,708
Hey, Dersh. Sorry to
get you out of bed.

1089
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:21,578
- What do you want? More money?
- Can you get more?

1090
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:26,449
Can I have a glass
of water, please?

1091
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:34,091
No. The reason I'm here, my
affidavit is inaccurate.

1092
01:13:38,695 --> 01:13:41,131
Great. Just what I need right now.

1093
01:13:42,365 --> 01:13:44,567
- It's slow.
- Yeah.

1094
01:13:44,601 --> 01:13:47,170
I left something out, something
incredibly important.

1095
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:52,009
Remember I gave Alex's drugs
to a woman at Clarendon Court?

1096
01:13:52,775 --> 01:13:54,344
Yeah. So?

1097
01:13:54,377 --> 01:13:56,946
Well, that bitch was
definitely Sunny von Bulow.

1098
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:04,087
David, this, this is bad.

1099
01:14:04,121 --> 01:14:06,070
It look bad. I've
met with you about

1100
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:08,125
five times now, and
all of a sudden...

1101
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:10,627
No, it's not sudden.

1102
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,376
I think I always
knew, but I became

1103
01:14:12,377 --> 01:14:14,331
convinced by staring
at pictures of her.

1104
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:21,104
Oh, we can't use your affidavit
unless it's truthful.

1105
01:14:21,138 --> 01:14:22,605
Are you sure this time?

1106
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:26,309
I swear, on the body
and soul of my mother.

1107
01:14:28,045 --> 01:14:29,412
Poor woman.

1108
01:14:32,682 --> 01:14:34,381
Put in this change,
and make him go

1109
01:14:34,382 --> 01:14:35,985
over every word of the affidavit.

1110
01:14:36,653 --> 01:14:38,021
Ah...

1111
01:14:38,188 --> 01:14:40,357
Can I use your men's room?

1112
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:52,035
More money?

1113
01:14:52,102 --> 01:14:53,102
Can you get more?

1114
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:01,510
If Claus had injected
her, he would've

1115
01:15:01,511 --> 01:15:03,313
thrown away the needle, right?

1116
01:15:03,346 --> 01:15:07,517
Sure. If he threw away the
insulin, why keep the needle?

1117
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:10,704
Claus is strange, but
he ain't stupid.

1118
01:15:10,705 --> 01:15:12,089
He is arrogant.

1119
01:15:12,122 --> 01:15:14,324
- Is that a crime?
- Sometimes.

1120
01:15:14,357 --> 01:15:16,693
Why are we even discussing this?

1121
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:18,828
It's obvious, the kids framed him.

1122
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:21,064
Whoa. You changed your tune.

1123
01:15:24,134 --> 01:15:27,104
A frame-up doesn't
mean he's innocent.

1124
01:15:27,137 --> 01:15:29,072
The kids could've
framed the guilty man.

1125
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,375
Dersh. Telephone.

1126
01:15:36,379 --> 01:15:38,248
It's Peter Macintosh.

1127
01:15:38,648 --> 01:15:39,749
Yeah.

1128
01:15:45,388 --> 01:15:47,257
Do you know what it is?

1129
01:15:49,226 --> 01:15:50,260
Okay.

1130
01:15:55,165 --> 01:15:57,092
Word in Rhode Island
is that the state

1131
01:15:57,093 --> 01:15:59,068
can't lose. Got an
ace up their sleeve.

1132
01:16:00,237 --> 01:16:01,404
What is it?

1133
01:16:04,241 --> 01:16:06,143
He's gonna try to find out.

1134
01:16:08,178 --> 01:16:10,780
- All right, my friend.
- Friend? I like that.

1135
01:16:10,813 --> 01:16:12,749
Nothing personal.

1136
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:14,884
Okay, no students, no witnesses.

1137
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:17,120
Second coma let's hear it.

1138
01:16:17,154 --> 01:16:18,721
Well, Alan,

1139
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:21,124
strange as it may seem
now, in retrospect...

1140
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:24,093
Okay, Claus, cut the
bullshit. December 20, 1980.

1141
01:16:27,164 --> 01:16:28,431
Sunny was unwell.

1142
01:16:28,465 --> 01:16:32,435
We'd been arguing all afternoon.

1143
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:36,139
I'd at last been offered a new
position in the oil business,

1144
01:16:36,173 --> 01:16:38,608
which would've meant my
spending some time in Europe.

1145
01:16:42,945 --> 01:16:44,914
Well, the discussion
must've escalated

1146
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:47,116
because I went to
talk to the children.

1147
01:16:49,386 --> 01:16:51,663
This cargo will bring 50,000 gold

1148
01:16:51,664 --> 01:16:54,424
florin from any rebels
worth the name.

1149
01:16:54,457 --> 01:16:58,161
50,000 florin? That's
a pretty good take.

1150
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:00,263
Let's put it to the vote.
All those in favour...

1151
01:17:00,297 --> 01:17:02,165
If you'll forgive
my interruption...

1152
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:08,771
I...

1153
01:17:08,805 --> 01:17:10,940
I've something to tell you both.

1154
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:14,177
We're heading for the
best pirate days ever.

1155
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:15,211
I...

1156
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,552
It looks as if...

1157
01:17:22,585 --> 01:17:26,323
As though Mummy and I are
going to have to split up,

1158
01:17:28,258 --> 01:17:31,361
because my work is something
she just cannot tolerate.

1159
01:17:31,394 --> 01:17:34,531
Well, mummy says things like that,

1160
01:17:34,564 --> 01:17:36,633
but she always gets over it.

1161
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:39,369
Yes, but this has been
going on for too long.

1162
01:17:47,344 --> 01:17:50,847
I'm going to Europe for a
few months in the new year.

1163
01:17:51,914 --> 01:17:53,441
Now, this will probably
lead to a split.

1164
01:17:53,442 --> 01:17:54,442
Oh.

1165
01:17:55,852 --> 01:17:58,355
It's all right.
She'll get over it.

1166
01:18:01,258 --> 01:18:02,408
Hey, well, Alexander says that

1167
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:03,826
conversation happened
the next day.

1168
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,528
Can you imagine
anything more absurd

1169
01:18:05,562 --> 01:18:07,830
than announcing your
intention to divorce a woman

1170
01:18:07,864 --> 01:18:10,533
who's just fallen into a coma?

1171
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:13,870
No. That evening everything
seemed normal enough.

1172
01:18:15,738 --> 01:18:20,209
Not cheerful. But then, we didn't
usually giggle at mealtimes.

1173
01:18:21,578 --> 01:18:24,381
Despite her doctor's
warnings about sweets,

1174
01:18:24,414 --> 01:18:27,384
the only thing Sunny
consumed was a sundae.

1175
01:18:39,396 --> 01:18:42,765
After supper, I went to finish
off some work in my study.

1176
01:18:42,799 --> 01:18:44,367
Oh, what should we all do?

1177
01:18:44,401 --> 01:18:48,037
The others decided to
chat in the living room.

1178
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,558
Oh, that would be
lovely, but first I

1179
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:53,242
need to go to my room
for just a minute.

1180
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:10,259
After about an hour, I
dropped in on them.

1181
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:17,266
Darling, would you
care for anything?

1182
01:19:22,372 --> 01:19:25,642
If there's some chicken
bouillon left.

1183
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:31,481
I'll look.

1184
01:19:46,529 --> 01:19:48,465
- There you are, darling.
- Ah.

1185
01:19:54,504 --> 01:19:55,872
Here.

1186
01:19:58,007 --> 01:19:59,342
Thank you.

1187
01:20:07,149 --> 01:20:09,519
How is your work coming?

1188
01:20:09,552 --> 01:20:12,722
I'm totally flummoxed. I can't get
the figures to make any sense.

1189
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:17,894
Why don't you call
your friend Deborah?

1190
01:20:19,396 --> 01:20:20,863
I doubt she'd be
in Saturday night.

1191
01:20:25,835 --> 01:20:29,806
So, Deborah, I think you'll agree
that's 7-2-8. Right. Now...

1192
01:20:29,839 --> 01:20:34,677
But Deborah was home, and we did
talk for some time, until...

1193
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:37,113
Claus, come quick.
Mummy's not well.

1194
01:20:37,114 --> 01:20:38,114
Hold on.

1195
01:20:38,115 --> 01:20:40,983
Deborah, can I call you back
in the morning? Thanks.

1196
01:20:41,017 --> 01:20:42,237
Her voice got very weak, and she

1197
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:43,686
almost fell down. I
had to help her.

1198
01:20:54,797 --> 01:20:56,699
Somebody open a window.

1199
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:02,371
I find the chill reassuring.

1200
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:08,678
Now I must speak with Claus.

1201
01:21:08,711 --> 01:21:11,047
- Good night, Mummy.
- Good night.

1202
01:21:15,485 --> 01:21:17,386
Good night, darling.

1203
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:20,723
Good night, Alex.

1204
01:21:31,834 --> 01:21:34,804
That is, if Claus
has time to talk.

1205
01:21:34,837 --> 01:21:36,930
Or are you going to
work every spare

1206
01:21:36,931 --> 01:21:38,741
moment right through Christmas?

1207
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:44,213
Is your work so fascinating?

1208
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:45,915
Or are you trying
to drive me away?

1209
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:47,947
Because if you are,
you're succeeding

1210
01:21:47,948 --> 01:21:50,052
beautifully, because
I don't want this.

1211
01:21:50,086 --> 01:21:53,790
I didn't marry you for this.
I could've had anybody.

1212
01:21:53,823 --> 01:21:55,758
With my money? Anybody.

1213
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:59,929
Well? Say something.

1214
01:22:02,599 --> 01:22:05,868
Do something. Be a man.

1215
01:22:07,937 --> 01:22:09,872
I already have a butler.

1216
01:22:14,511 --> 01:22:17,747
Do something. I don't want this.

1217
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:21,017
I don't. I don't want this.

1218
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:24,120
I don't... I don't want this.

1219
01:22:25,822 --> 01:22:28,525
The same conversation
as the previous year,

1220
01:22:28,558 --> 01:22:30,760
only this time with greater venom.

1221
01:22:30,793 --> 01:22:34,664
You've always been afraid of me.
It's not because of my money.

1222
01:22:34,697 --> 01:22:37,500
It's basically because
you're a coward.

1223
01:22:37,567 --> 01:22:39,831
Your pitiful masculinity
is so fragile, you

1224
01:22:39,832 --> 01:22:41,838
can't stand the idea
of confrontation,

1225
01:22:41,871 --> 01:22:44,273
so you go off with Miss Botsky.

1226
01:22:44,306 --> 01:22:45,675
Good night.

1227
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,495
As was usual, I was
awakened before dawn.

1228
01:23:12,669 --> 01:23:15,271
I let the dogs out,
as was customary.

1229
01:23:20,009 --> 01:23:24,046
I went back through the bedroom to
my study as quietly as possible.

1230
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:32,755
I did not notice if
my wife was in bed.

1231
01:23:32,789 --> 01:23:36,593
I did not notice if the light
was on under the bathroom door.

1232
01:23:36,626 --> 01:23:39,528
Had it been on, I wouldn't
have given it a thought.

1233
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:42,832
I did my exercises, showered,

1234
01:23:42,865 --> 01:23:45,568
and then I called Deborah Knowles.

1235
01:23:45,635 --> 01:23:47,904
Well, I mean, it's stable
and it's profitable.

1236
01:23:49,105 --> 01:23:50,673
Can anyone really believe,

1237
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:53,009
if I was trying to murder my wife,

1238
01:23:53,042 --> 01:23:56,879
that I would spend an hour going
over a tedious set of figures?

1239
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,683
After the call, I passed
through the bedroom again.

1240
01:24:00,717 --> 01:24:02,585
I remember it was freezing.

1241
01:24:02,619 --> 01:24:05,588
By this time, Sunny was
certainly not in bed.

1242
01:24:05,755 --> 01:24:07,924
And I heard water running
in the bathroom.

1243
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:14,697
I had breakfast, walked the dogs,

1244
01:24:14,731 --> 01:24:18,334
and, on my return, asked the
children where Mummy was.

1245
01:24:19,636 --> 01:24:21,771
Has Mummy had breakfast yet?

1246
01:24:21,804 --> 01:24:23,572
We haven't seen her.

1247
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:28,978
Sunny?

1248
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:33,215
Her bathroom was her
private sanctuary.

1249
01:24:33,249 --> 01:24:38,220
No one entered it. Except the
maid, of course, to clean up.

1250
01:24:38,254 --> 01:24:41,724
Sometimes she stayed there
for hours, or so it seemed.

1251
01:24:41,758 --> 01:24:45,628
One can only speculate what
goes on behind a closed door.

1252
01:24:45,762 --> 01:24:47,363
Sunny, are you there?

1253
01:24:48,698 --> 01:24:50,599
I hesitated even to knock.

1254
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:54,804
Darling?

1255
01:25:10,987 --> 01:25:12,154
Sunny?

1256
01:25:14,356 --> 01:25:17,193
Oh, God.

1257
01:25:17,226 --> 01:25:19,276
Once I'd ascertained she was

1258
01:25:19,277 --> 01:25:22,131
breathing, I went
to fetch Alexander.

1259
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:26,669
- Why not call an ambulance first?
- Panic, Alan, panic.

1260
01:25:26,703 --> 01:25:28,705
I mean, I...

1261
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:31,941
I needed to talk to
somebody. That...

1262
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:33,849
It was not I wasn't worried if she

1263
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:35,945
was breathing normally.
It wasn't...

1264
01:25:35,978 --> 01:25:37,814
It wasn't like the year before.

1265
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,716
I mean...

1266
01:25:39,749 --> 01:25:43,720
In retrospect it seems absurd,
but I looked at her upper lip.

1267
01:25:43,753 --> 01:25:45,955
She had blood on it. I thought
she'd broken a tooth.

1268
01:25:45,988 --> 01:25:48,424
That was the extent of my concern.

1269
01:25:49,025 --> 01:25:50,827
And that's...

1270
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:54,764
And that's really all I can...
That's really all I can say.

1271
01:25:56,933 --> 01:26:00,002
- But is it the truth?
- Of course.

1272
01:26:00,036 --> 01:26:04,707
- But not the whole truth.
- I don't know the whole truth.

1273
01:26:04,741 --> 01:26:07,043
I don't know what happened to her.

1274
01:26:07,076 --> 01:26:09,245
I wish I didn't believe you.

1275
01:26:09,278 --> 01:26:12,681
It's very hard to trust
someone you don't understand.

1276
01:26:14,884 --> 01:26:16,919
You're a very strange man.

1277
01:26:18,187 --> 01:26:19,789
You have no idea.

1278
01:26:28,177 --> 01:26:29,177
Everybody here?

1279
01:26:29,178 --> 01:26:31,067
Peter Macintosh says
he's got bad news.

1280
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:35,738
There he is.

1281
01:26:48,785 --> 01:26:51,020
Well?

1282
01:26:51,053 --> 01:26:52,755
I found out what the state has.

1283
01:26:52,889 --> 01:26:53,923
Their ace in the hole.

1284
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:56,826
It's you.

1285
01:26:58,895 --> 01:27:00,129
It's me?

1286
01:27:00,162 --> 01:27:04,066
David Marriott taped all his
conversations with you.

1287
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,402
Oh, great.

1288
01:27:06,435 --> 01:27:10,739
The scuttlebutt is, if we win
the case, you go to prison.

1289
01:27:12,074 --> 01:27:14,243
What did I say?

1290
01:27:14,276 --> 01:27:17,413
Good old corrupt Rhode Island.
A friend got me an excerpt.

1291
01:27:17,446 --> 01:27:20,950
The reason I'm here... My
affidavit is inaccurate.

1292
01:27:22,018 --> 01:27:24,286
David, this is bad. It looks bad.

1293
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,788
What do you want? More money?

1294
01:27:26,522 --> 01:27:28,157
Can you get more?

1295
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:31,260
Yeah.

1296
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:33,896
- That is not what I said.
- It's on tape, Alan.

1297
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:36,398
I don't care if it's on tape.
That's not what I said.

1298
01:27:36,432 --> 01:27:38,767
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

1299
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:44,506
I'll tell you what we do. We
ignore it. That's what we do.

1300
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:47,143
Alan, with that tape,
it's your whole career.

1301
01:27:49,378 --> 01:27:52,248
I now believe Claus is innocent,

1302
01:27:52,281 --> 01:27:55,818
so we've decided no tricks,
no technicalities.

1303
01:27:55,852 --> 01:27:58,120
We are going to base
our appeal directly

1304
01:27:58,154 --> 01:28:01,257
and explicitly on
Claus's innocence.

1305
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:04,827
That's not proper. An appeal has
to be based on judicial error.

1306
01:28:04,894 --> 01:28:06,829
It is. The judge should've
thrown out the case.

1307
01:28:06,996 --> 01:28:08,604
How can you say there
wasn't sufficient

1308
01:28:08,605 --> 01:28:10,132
evidence when the
jury convicted him?

1309
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:12,534
- That's a good point.
- That's what we are saying.

1310
01:28:12,568 --> 01:28:15,471
If the rules don't
work, you change them.

1311
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:17,940
Red Auerbach got the
jump-ball rule changed

1312
01:28:17,974 --> 01:28:19,608
when the Celtics had a short team.

1313
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:21,443
Ah, but it's dangerous
politically, Alan.

1314
01:28:21,477 --> 01:28:23,044
If the judges feel insulted,
then we're gonna...

1315
01:28:23,045 --> 01:28:24,113
Wait up here.

1316
01:28:24,146 --> 01:28:26,315
State supreme court
shouldn't even look

1317
01:28:26,348 --> 01:28:28,184
at an appeal based
on new evidence.

1318
01:28:29,986 --> 01:28:34,556
Hey, guys. I'll take care of that,
okay? You just leave it to me.

1319
01:28:37,026 --> 01:28:41,330
Look, I know you're all
exhausted. We got four days left.

1320
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:43,332
What we do now is gonna
decide this thing.

1321
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:44,867
Do you wanna win or not?

1322
01:28:45,034 --> 01:28:47,136
- Alan. We've got something.
- What?

1323
01:28:47,169 --> 01:28:49,205
We've hit the jackpot.

1324
01:28:49,238 --> 01:28:52,141
Our needles that had
amobarbital and Valium...

1325
01:28:52,174 --> 01:28:53,409
But no insulin.

1326
01:28:53,442 --> 01:28:57,880
Both came back with false-positive
readings for insulin.

1327
01:28:58,948 --> 01:29:00,883
One was 93, the other 282.

1328
01:29:01,017 --> 01:29:03,552
We've knocked out every piece
of their medical case.

1329
01:29:05,955 --> 01:29:07,256
- Whoo.
- Good one. Good one.

1330
01:29:07,289 --> 01:29:11,360
Okay, now all they've
got left is my neck.

1331
01:29:11,393 --> 01:29:14,030
Anybody know anything about
editing audio tapes?

1332
01:29:23,239 --> 01:29:25,874
Defence. For what?
Defence. Come on.

1333
01:29:27,076 --> 01:29:29,378
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

1334
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:39,555
- All right, Alan.
- Come on.

1335
01:29:40,156 --> 01:29:41,423
Hurry up.

1336
01:29:42,224 --> 01:29:44,560
Pass it, Alan.

1337
01:29:44,593 --> 01:29:47,029
Wait a minute. No, I got
it. I got it. Where's Raj?

1338
01:29:47,063 --> 01:29:49,665
- He's upstairs.
- Where are you going?

1339
01:29:50,967 --> 01:29:53,936
Raj. Raj, I got it.

1340
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:56,705
I got it. Remember Maria?

1341
01:29:56,738 --> 01:29:58,941
She could have said
it like this...

1342
01:29:59,008 --> 01:30:03,279
Insulin? For what, insulin?

1343
01:30:05,081 --> 01:30:07,383
My lady is not diabetic.

1344
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:11,387
You see? "My lady
is not diabetic."

1345
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:14,623
She is assuming that
the bag is Sunny's.

1346
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,959
Her first reaction, instantaneous,

1347
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:18,961
not part of a legal
strategy devised later,

1348
01:30:19,128 --> 01:30:22,231
is that the stuff in the black bag
belonged to Sunny, not Claus.

1349
01:30:22,264 --> 01:30:24,933
Who's gonna know better
than she? Start writing.

1350
01:30:26,668 --> 01:30:29,605
You are not God. You
are a prosecutor.

1351
01:30:29,638 --> 01:30:31,918
And Alabama cannot
execute those Johnson

1352
01:30:31,919 --> 01:30:33,976
kids before the
Supreme Court rules.

1353
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:35,611
That's right. You heard me right.

1354
01:30:35,644 --> 01:30:37,513
You got two hours to
get to Rhode Island.

1355
01:30:37,546 --> 01:30:39,681
- You're gonna have to speed.
- You want me to commit a crime?

1356
01:30:39,715 --> 01:30:41,582
Of course, not. Because if you
do, they're gonna stop you

1357
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:42,985
and you're not gonna
make the deadline.

1358
01:30:43,019 --> 01:30:45,988
I'm telling you right now, buddy,
those kids fry, you're next.

1359
01:30:46,022 --> 01:30:48,657
You're damn right.

1360
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:51,593
Some startling developments
in the von Bulow case.

1361
01:30:51,627 --> 01:30:53,762
Harvard Law School
professor Alan Dershowitz

1362
01:30:53,795 --> 01:30:56,999
had been accused of paying
for falsified testimony,

1363
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:59,001
but those accusations
were discredited today

1364
01:30:59,035 --> 01:31:01,003
by the Rhode Island
attorney general,

1365
01:31:01,137 --> 01:31:03,605
who announced that David
Marriott's tape was doctored

1366
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:07,009
and that Marriott is not
a reliable witness.

1367
01:31:07,043 --> 01:31:10,446
So, what was he up to, Alan?
Who was he working for?

1368
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:12,081
Damned if I know.

1369
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:18,020
Hope they don't think
he was working for you.

1370
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:19,706
Well, no one's going to...

1371
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:22,124
Look, I don't think
you did it, okay?

1372
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:25,661
But at the Chinese restaurant,
you did duck the big question.

1373
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:27,996
Chuck is our Alexandra
Isles expert.

1374
01:31:29,598 --> 01:31:34,036
Sunny's aspirin overdose.
Why did she take so many?

1375
01:31:35,837 --> 01:31:38,374
What happened? Sunny
had a headache?

1376
01:31:41,277 --> 01:31:45,013
The headache was Alexandra, right?

1377
01:31:49,785 --> 01:31:51,587
Let's hear it, Claus.

1378
01:31:53,622 --> 01:31:55,524
Alexandra was spiteful.

1379
01:31:57,193 --> 01:32:00,729
On the day of Sunny's
aspirin overdose,

1380
01:32:02,298 --> 01:32:07,136
she returned some presents I'd
given her, some photographs.

1381
01:32:08,104 --> 01:32:09,371
Love letters.

1382
01:32:11,107 --> 01:32:13,309
She dropped them off
in a shopping bag.

1383
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:16,545
Did Sunny see them?

1384
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:19,381
Sunny was home. I was not.

1385
01:32:21,383 --> 01:32:26,088
Alexandra neglected to
address the package to me.

1386
01:32:26,222 --> 01:32:29,558
I wanna be left alone with
all those beautiful letters.

1387
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:30,726
What did you do
with those letters?

1388
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:32,361
Why did you write those letters?

1389
01:32:35,164 --> 01:32:39,135
There's a big difference between
knowing about an affair

1390
01:32:39,168 --> 01:32:42,070
and having love letters
crammed down your throat.

1391
01:32:44,406 --> 01:32:47,109
It seems that Sunny did
care about your affair.

1392
01:32:47,143 --> 01:32:48,143
She cared a lot.

1393
01:32:52,181 --> 01:32:54,082
Why didn't you tell us?

1394
01:32:55,251 --> 01:32:58,154
Everything was open-book.

1395
01:32:58,187 --> 01:33:01,357
"Get the best experts." "I'm
not afraid of the truth."

1396
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:10,098
Looks to me like Alexandra tried
to force Sunny into suicide.

1397
01:33:12,934 --> 01:33:15,103
Or they plotted it together.

1398
01:33:16,272 --> 01:33:18,274
Either way, he's
protecting Alexandra

1399
01:33:18,307 --> 01:33:20,342
because he still in love with her.

1400
01:33:20,376 --> 01:33:23,111
And why not? Hey, she's a babe.

1401
01:33:25,647 --> 01:33:27,783
Of course I still love her.

1402
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:31,620
And hate her.

1403
01:33:33,622 --> 01:33:37,526
Alexandra, Sunny, Andrea...

1404
01:33:40,729 --> 01:33:42,331
I love them all.

1405
01:33:50,306 --> 01:33:52,808
Being a human being
is very literal.

1406
01:33:53,309 --> 01:33:54,476
You're trapped.

1407
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:58,480
Time moves in only one
direction, forward.

1408
01:33:58,514 --> 01:34:02,518
It's stupid and boring and
results in a lot of silliness.

1409
01:34:02,551 --> 01:34:06,888
Example, the legal process.

1410
01:34:06,922 --> 01:34:09,715
In this particular
case, a vast amount

1411
01:34:09,716 --> 01:34:12,294
of time, effort and
money was spent

1412
01:34:12,328 --> 01:34:14,796
trying to determine
precisely what happened

1413
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:17,633
on those two nights so
close to Christmas,

1414
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:22,871
December 26, 1979,
December 20, 1980.

1415
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,342
Happened right here.

1416
01:34:27,576 --> 01:34:31,247
Even now, it all looks the same,

1417
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:34,550
feels the same, smells the same.

1418
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:38,220
If you could just go back in time

1419
01:34:38,254 --> 01:34:40,689
and take a peek, you'd know.

1420
01:34:42,758 --> 01:34:45,261
And all this would be unnecessary.

1421
01:34:45,294 --> 01:34:46,562
All rise.

1422
01:34:50,566 --> 01:34:52,757
Hear ye, hear ye.
All persons having

1423
01:34:52,758 --> 01:34:54,770
business before the Supreme Court

1424
01:34:54,803 --> 01:34:56,272
holding in province within

1425
01:34:56,305 --> 01:34:59,941
and for the State of Rhode
Island may now draw near.

1426
01:34:59,975 --> 01:35:03,879
Then again, everyone
enjoys a circus.

1427
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:06,815
Be seated.

1428
01:35:09,385 --> 01:35:11,820
If the appellant is
ready, you may proceed.

1429
01:35:13,555 --> 01:35:15,724
If it would please the court,
oral argument will be made

1430
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:18,960
by out-of-state counsel,
Professor Alan Dershowitz.

1431
01:35:29,070 --> 01:35:33,709
Your Honours, you may not
like Claus von Bulow.

1432
01:35:33,742 --> 01:35:35,544
You may think he is
guilty of something.

1433
01:35:35,577 --> 01:35:39,281
But I am here to tell
you he is innocent.

1434
01:35:39,415 --> 01:35:41,191
Our new evidence will
clearly indicate...

1435
01:35:41,192 --> 01:35:42,192
Professor.

1436
01:35:42,193 --> 01:35:43,552
You know there is no single case

1437
01:35:43,585 --> 01:35:47,289
which allows you to introduce
new evidence on appeal.

1438
01:35:47,323 --> 01:35:52,260
But there is one, Your Honour.
And you wrote it, Derek.

1439
01:35:53,662 --> 01:35:57,799
In Derek, in Derek,
you yourself said,

1440
01:35:57,833 --> 01:36:00,375
that a case based
on circumstantial

1441
01:36:00,376 --> 01:36:02,070
theory rather than fact

1442
01:36:02,103 --> 01:36:05,974
only stands up if no other
theory makes sense.

1443
01:36:06,007 --> 01:36:09,611
The only way to show a better
theory is to present it.

1444
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:18,286
Get on with it, counsellor.

1445
01:36:19,455 --> 01:36:23,325
The first issue is the
encrusted needle.

1446
01:36:23,459 --> 01:36:26,362
I hope you will have the courage
to free an innocent man

1447
01:36:26,395 --> 01:36:28,830
and remedy a grave injustice.

1448
01:36:28,864 --> 01:36:33,101
This will never work. Too
smart for his own good.

1449
01:36:33,134 --> 01:36:37,739
Alan says it will work. If the
prosecutor takes the bait.

1450
01:36:38,674 --> 01:36:40,676
What do you mean, "bait"?

1451
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:43,979
Argues the evidence.

1452
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:47,516
Your Honours, introduction
of new evidence on appeal

1453
01:36:48,984 --> 01:36:53,655
violates every principle of
jurisprudence, every statute,

1454
01:36:54,556 --> 01:36:57,559
every precedent, every
rule of ethics.

1455
01:36:57,593 --> 01:36:59,127
Ah, he's nailing us
right off the bat.

1456
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:03,331
I am not going to stand before you
and argue Mr von Bulow's guilt.

1457
01:37:06,402 --> 01:37:09,371
However, I have no
choice but to address

1458
01:37:09,505 --> 01:37:11,473
Mr Dershowitz's
arguments one by one.

1459
01:37:13,493 --> 01:37:14,493
Bingo.

1460
01:37:14,494 --> 01:37:16,945
First, the matter of
the encrusted needle.

1461
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:23,385
So, now it's up to the judges.
Tell me what you really think.

1462
01:37:23,419 --> 01:37:26,955
I think it's easier to love
somebody than to live with them.

1463
01:37:29,190 --> 01:37:32,761
Love is fantasy. Living is work.

1464
01:37:32,794 --> 01:37:36,398
I'll say. And those people
don't like to work.

1465
01:37:36,432 --> 01:37:38,834
But if you don't do the
work, the love dies,

1466
01:37:38,867 --> 01:37:41,403
and nobody wants to
deal with that one.

1467
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:43,104
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1468
01:37:43,138 --> 01:37:46,475
The love died, Sunny
couldn't accept it...

1469
01:37:47,709 --> 01:37:49,678
So Claus tried to kill her?

1470
01:37:49,711 --> 01:37:53,014
- Maybe.
- I don't agree.

1471
01:37:53,048 --> 01:37:56,552
Face it. All we had to do was
prove the state made a lousy case.

1472
01:37:56,585 --> 01:37:58,186
We didn't prove that
Claus was innocent.

1473
01:37:58,219 --> 01:38:00,756
We couldn't, we didn't have
to, and he probably isn't.

1474
01:38:00,789 --> 01:38:02,090
He isn't? You mean you think...

1475
01:38:02,123 --> 01:38:04,560
I mean, so he didn't
inject Sunny with insulin.

1476
01:38:04,593 --> 01:38:07,429
So what? Break it down.
First coma, no problem.

1477
01:38:07,463 --> 01:38:10,632
Even the attending doctor thought
it was caused by hypoglycaemia,

1478
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:12,868
loss of air to the brain
and so on. All right.

1479
01:38:12,901 --> 01:38:14,603
But what about the second coma?

1480
01:38:14,636 --> 01:38:17,138
I mean, why does
Claus act so guilty?

1481
01:38:17,172 --> 01:38:19,052
Hey, come on.
Wouldn't any man feel

1482
01:38:19,053 --> 01:38:20,776
guilty if his wife was suicidal?

1483
01:38:20,809 --> 01:38:24,045
Yeah. So maybe she took
the sleeping pills

1484
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:26,448
with the intention
of killing herself.

1485
01:38:26,482 --> 01:38:29,885
But how did she end up
lying on a marble floor

1486
01:38:29,918 --> 01:38:32,420
in a freezing bathroom with her
head under the toilet bowl?

1487
01:38:32,921 --> 01:38:34,422
How about this?

1488
01:39:22,638 --> 01:39:24,472
Sunny wakes up miserable.

1489
01:39:29,678 --> 01:39:32,480
Second marriage is over,
children are leaving home.

1490
01:39:33,815 --> 01:39:35,517
What's to live for?

1491
01:41:48,216 --> 01:41:49,666
But when she was found, her

1492
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:51,653
nightgown was hiked
over her waist.

1493
01:41:51,687 --> 01:41:55,857
Exactly. How did it get there?

1494
01:41:55,891 --> 01:41:59,828
Okay, let's say she's standing
at the sink. She has to pee.

1495
01:41:59,861 --> 01:42:03,331
At exactly the same
instant, the drugs hit,

1496
01:42:03,364 --> 01:42:07,202
her body convulses, she
grabs the nightgown.

1497
01:42:11,406 --> 01:42:14,810
- I don't buy that.
- It does seem far-fetched.

1498
01:42:14,843 --> 01:42:17,045
- Well, so is the truth sometimes.
- Oh, bull.

1499
01:42:17,078 --> 01:42:19,114
I think she took the
barbiturates the previous night.

1500
01:42:19,147 --> 01:42:22,684
And, let's say, he
saw her take them.

1501
01:42:22,818 --> 01:42:26,321
Or she told him she was going
to before they fell asleep.

1502
01:42:34,830 --> 01:42:37,265
This time, he wants
her to succeed.

1503
01:42:47,843 --> 01:42:49,010
Sunny?

1504
01:43:16,204 --> 01:43:18,406
Maybe there's some way
he can help her along.

1505
01:43:19,975 --> 01:43:22,878
Of course. The open window.

1506
01:43:23,879 --> 01:43:25,313
Zero degrees.

1507
01:43:26,882 --> 01:43:29,751
But somebody might see her there.

1508
01:43:29,885 --> 01:43:33,054
The action of dragging her would
naturally pull up the nightgown.

1509
01:44:03,418 --> 01:44:06,454
In this cold, how long
could she survive?

1510
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:29,577
Remember what Sunny said?

1511
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:33,815
"I would've been better off.
You would've been better off."

1512
01:44:38,987 --> 01:44:41,489
because the law is a
blunt instrument.

1513
01:44:41,522 --> 01:44:45,426
It is not a rapier.
It is a cudgel.

1514
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:47,268
Tomorrow, death penalty. Which

1515
01:44:47,269 --> 01:44:49,497
reminds me of the
comedian who said

1516
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:51,833
"I don't know why they
call it the death penalty?

1517
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,102
"It's no penalty. You're
out of the game."

1518
01:45:03,211 --> 01:45:04,612
- Good news.
- Great news.

1519
01:45:04,645 --> 01:45:06,114
And more good news.

1520
01:45:06,147 --> 01:45:08,349
- The decision came down?
- They just announced it.

1521
01:45:08,383 --> 01:45:11,019
- Five-zip.
- We murdered them.

1522
01:45:11,052 --> 01:45:12,052
Grounds?

1523
01:45:12,053 --> 01:45:13,454
Well, they got the
Brillhoffer notes.

1524
01:45:13,488 --> 01:45:16,357
And that silly-silly, guilty-man's
argument, search and seizure.

1525
01:45:16,391 --> 01:45:18,293
- Federal or state?
- Both.

1526
01:45:18,326 --> 01:45:20,862
Yeah, if it's federal, they could
appeal at US Supreme Court,

1527
01:45:20,996 --> 01:45:22,864
but because it's Rhode
Island, they can't. We win.

1528
01:45:24,232 --> 01:45:26,868
Don't get too excited till
we see Brillhoffer's notes.

1529
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:28,536
We destroyed their medical case,

1530
01:45:28,569 --> 01:45:30,480
but their witnesses
still carry emotional

1531
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:32,073
weight if there is a second trial.

1532
01:45:32,107 --> 01:45:34,073
Unless the Brillhoffer notes show

1533
01:45:34,074 --> 01:45:36,277
that they've changed
their stories.

1534
01:45:38,013 --> 01:45:39,614
Good afternoon, sir.

1535
01:45:41,249 --> 01:45:43,851
- Let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

1536
01:45:58,033 --> 01:46:00,668
- You have Brillhoffer's notes?
- Yes.

1537
01:46:00,701 --> 01:46:02,904
- Well?
- They're not what we hoped.

1538
01:46:03,071 --> 01:46:04,239
I knew it.

1539
01:46:07,375 --> 01:46:09,110
They're much better.

1540
01:46:11,046 --> 01:46:12,819
No one mentioned
seeing insulin when

1541
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:14,449
they first talked to Brillhoffer.

1542
01:46:14,482 --> 01:46:17,953
Plus, Maria told him
that, at Thanksgiving,

1543
01:46:17,986 --> 01:46:20,221
when she supposedly first saw
insulin for the first time,

1544
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:24,359
she couldn't even read any of the
labels. They were all scraped off.

1545
01:46:24,392 --> 01:46:26,928
- What does this mean?
- It means,

1546
01:46:27,062 --> 01:46:28,129
that if there is a second trial,

1547
01:46:28,163 --> 01:46:30,231
we can be reasonably confident.

1548
01:46:30,265 --> 01:46:33,935
Both the medical case and their
witnesses are now highly suspect.

1549
01:46:34,102 --> 01:46:35,102
Ah.

1550
01:46:56,457 --> 01:46:59,594
Darling, this is Alan Dershowitz.

1551
01:47:00,295 --> 01:47:02,130
Yes, I know. Hello.

1552
01:47:02,163 --> 01:47:05,933
Alan tells me... Well,
things look very hopeful.

1553
01:47:07,768 --> 01:47:10,305
I knew it would come out
all right. Thank you.

1554
01:47:14,642 --> 01:47:17,678
Yes, Alan, thank you. I
am eternally grateful.

1555
01:47:17,712 --> 01:47:19,747
Hey, this means we'll be
getting back your bail.

1556
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:21,983
A million dollars.

1557
01:47:22,017 --> 01:47:24,052
I know I still owe you, Alan.

1558
01:47:25,620 --> 01:47:27,622
Please send me your bill.

1559
01:47:28,623 --> 01:47:30,491
And maybe when you're in New York

1560
01:47:30,525 --> 01:47:35,997
we can meet for lunch.
I'd enjoy that.

1561
01:47:36,164 --> 01:47:39,400
One thing, Claus. Legally,
this was an important victory.

1562
01:47:40,468 --> 01:47:42,637
Morally, you're on your own.

1563
01:47:55,316 --> 01:47:57,793
Claus von Bulow was given a second

1564
01:47:57,794 --> 01:48:00,488
trial and acquitted
on both counts.

1565
01:48:03,058 --> 01:48:07,662
This is all you can know,
all you can be told.

1566
01:48:09,164 --> 01:48:13,000
When you get where I am,
you will know the rest.

1567
01:48:46,201 --> 01:48:48,469
Two packs of Vantage, please.

1568
01:48:56,411 --> 01:49:00,415
- Anything else?
- Yes, a phial of insulin.

1569
01:49:07,822 --> 01:49:09,224
Just kidding.
