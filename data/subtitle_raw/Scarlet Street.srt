1
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:33,005
PERVERSITY

2
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:20,799
Not I want to ruin you the party.

3
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,481
However, it is not wise
to make a woman wait.

4
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:25,916
You already know like they are.
- Yes indeed, Mister Hogarth.

5
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:28,117
Go if we know it.
- All are same.

6
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:31,157
I see that you are some experts.

7
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:36,557
Frankly, boys,
it has been a veiled one stupendous.

8
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,717
And before leaving...

9
00:02:40,647 --> 00:02:43,684
...here I have a clock of gold
with seventeen rubies.

10
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,241
An appropriate gift
because it is for somebody...

11
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:50,763
...that he/she has a heart of gold
and he/she is an exemplary employee.

12
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:52,838
Very well.
- He/she deserves it.

13
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:54,566
Please, surrender it.

14
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:58,276
A magnificent clock.
- What he/she marvels.

15
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,116
Chris.

16
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:09,643
He/she looks at what takes engraving,
Chris.

17
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,566
For my friend
Christopher Cross...

18
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:21,762
...in recognition
of 25 years of loyalty...

19
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:27,436
...of J.J. Hogarth, 1899 -1934.

20
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,441
That he/she speaks that speaks.

21
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:33,241
Yes, Chris, I gave something.
- We go, Chris, I gave something.

22
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,721
Good...

23
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,558
...I don't know what to say, J.J.

24
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:42,404
It is... it is beautiful.

25
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:46,675
I never hoped to have
a clock like east.

26
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,085
This is as a dream.

27
00:03:49,847 --> 00:03:52,122
In short, it pleases me to say...

28
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:54,437
...that we have the best boss
of New York.

29
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,042
Congratulations.

30
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,686
Congratulations, boy.

31
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,359
Thank you, thank you.

32
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,520
Thank You, Chris.
Thank you, old friend.

33
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,683
God blesses you.
- Thank you.

34
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:23,603
He/she walks, smoke you a cigarette.
- Good, me...

35
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:25,405
Not I can.
- He/she comes, one proves.

36
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:27,523
They make them
especially for me.

37
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:30,476
He/she Takes, Charlie.
- Thank you.

38
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,035
Thank you.

39
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,518
Not you will be superstitious,
hey, Chris?

40
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,478
No, no, at all.

41
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,118
Please,
you don't interrupt the party...

42
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:52,040
...only because I should leave.
Everything runs of my bill.

43
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:54,443
Thank you.

44
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:56,286
Drink as much as you want...

45
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:59,598
...but on Monday you don't arrive me
take to the work and with hangover.

46
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,759
Well, good night, friends.

47
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,075
Good night.

48
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:13,396
You are a type with luck.
- Small clock.

49
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:14,966
It is a magnificent clock.

50
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:20,282
Boys, venid here.
Look.

51
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:22,957
Look.

52
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,765
What do you find?
Go treasure.

53
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:33,962
Yes.

54
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,280
Is their wife?

55
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:39,683
The boss leaves spree.

56
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,083
With a woman this way anyone.

57
00:05:54,207 --> 00:05:56,402
The spring
he/she has a special scent.

58
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:57,886
Where do you go, Chris?

59
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:00,398
To the meter station
of Lade Side.

60
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:02,478
It is the quickest way
of arriving in Brooklyn.

61
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:08,645
Not you have umbrella,
I will accompany you to the bus.

62
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,446
No, it doesn't plunder you on the way.
- I don't care to go for a walk.

63
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:13,518
He/she will come me well
some fresh air.

64
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:17,045
I drank too much.

65
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,555
What annoyance, I will catch the next one.

66
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,046
You veto to the meter, Chris.

67
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,846
I don't care to wait,
I sit down a little alone.

68
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,401
He/she Hears, Charlie.

69
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,521
You believe that J.J.
does he/she have a mess with that girl?

70
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:52,366
It is what seems.

71
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,035
I wonder how it will be.
- What, Chris?

72
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:02,243
Because to feel that he/she loves you
a treasure like that.

73
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:06,359
To me they have never looked this way at me,
not even of young.

74
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,721
Yes, we are usually sleepy
that they are not completed...

75
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:12,002
...although we continue dreaming.

76
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:14,477
I remember that of young
he/she wanted to be painting.

77
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,799
And he/she dreamt with which one day
I would transform into a great artist.

78
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,798
And you already see,
I am a simple cashier.

79
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,482
Still spots?
- Yes, on Sundays.

80
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,558
It is a way of killing the time.

81
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:26,842
On Sunday is the only day
that I don't like.

82
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:28,042
Not I know what devils to make.

83
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:30,766
Why don't you come home tomorrow?
- Thank you, Chris, I will go.

84
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:37,443
Good night.
- Good night, until tomorrow.

85
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:38,801
Yes, until tomorrow.

86
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,078
It has stopped of raining.
- Half hour ago.

87
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,964
The meter station
of Lade Side?

88
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:01,765
Return to the corner
and cross the high one...

89
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:04,236
...to some four apples.
- Thank you, agent.

90
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,316
A mess was made.

91
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:07,477
These streets of Village
they are a labyrinth.

92
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,486
Is it wounded?

93
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:58,805
I will warn to the police.
- No, wait, wait.

94
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,162
Agent!

95
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,122
Agent!

96
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,685
For where has he/she gone?
- Over there.

97
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:31,720
What aspect did he/she have?
- I don't know it.

98
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:33,963
Not I could see him/her the face.
- He/she stole me 15 dollars.

99
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,322
He/she didn't believe me when I said that
he/she didn't have more and it hit me.

100
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,398
For luck this gentleman
he/she went in my defense.

101
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,045
It is this way, it was there same.

102
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,163
Not I could retain him/her,
he/she got up and he/she began to run.

103
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:43,441
Wait here.

104
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:46,919
Please, larguémonos.

105
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,406
We have to wait
to the agent.

106
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,523
Not I want to see my name
in the newspapers, and you?

107
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:51,756
The newspapers?
- Clear.

108
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:53,439
We would have
that to present an accusation.

109
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,926
When they arrest somebody,
they will call him/her...

110
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:57,043
...week after week,
it is a can.

111
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,200
Does it accompany me to house?
- Because me...

112
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,366
Yes, clear, clear,
if he/she believes it necessary.

113
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:06,562
We go there.

114
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,923
Well, this it is my house.

115
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:16,037
I sit down not to be able to invite him/her to ascend.

116
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:19,358
I share the apartment
with another girl, Millie.

117
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,642
Good night
and thank you again.

118
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:25,522
How's it going...?

119
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,197
How's it going if we take a coffee?

120
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:30,755
Of agreement.

121
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,199
Hello, Kitty.
- Hello, Tiny.

122
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,765
This is the gentleman...
- Cross.

123
00:10:51,687 --> 00:10:54,599
Charmed, Mister Cross.
- A lot of pleasure, Tiny.

124
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:56,915
Have you seen Johnny?

125
00:10:58,647 --> 00:11:00,239
No, since he/she left
he/she makes a while.

126
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,801
Two coffees, please.
- I have changed opinion.

127
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:05,605
I will take a glass,
a rum Collins.

128
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,121
Only one?
- Yes, yes.

129
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,802
Please, cheer up, man.

130
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:14,883
He/she will see, it is that I have spent
a little with the champagne.

131
00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:16,645
Does he/she want champagne?

132
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:20,279
I will take the same thing that her.

133
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,356
From the moment in that I saw it
let us wonder which their name would be.

134
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:28,243
Kitty.
- In fact...

135
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,957
...he/she is Katherine,
Katherine March.

136
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,717
My friends call me Kitty.

137
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,558
How do they call him/her their friends?

138
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:40,836
Chris.

139
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,358
Chris Cross.

140
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:46,206
Chris Cross.

141
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,596
Yes, they usually wear out jokes
with that, but...

142
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:50,086
...I don't care it.

143
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:03,324
Why does he/she look this way at me?

144
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,525
Do I have the dirty face?

145
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:07,515
It is beautiful.

146
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,679
Yes, clear.

147
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:14,644
What aspect I have.

148
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:18,766
Thank you.

149
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:24,960
Health, Chris.

150
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:28,526
Miss March.

151
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,482
Kitty.

152
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,558
Yes, young lady.
Good...

153
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:33,956
Kitty...

154
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,406
In short... He/she Will See, Kitty...

155
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,684
...the certain thing is that
he/she could be their father.

156
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:41,756
Not it is so old.

157
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:43,882
Do you believe?

158
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,162
Neither he/she is a boy,
he/she is a man...

159
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:48,396
...mature.

160
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,398
I like mature men.

161
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:54,202
Well, what he meant
it is that...

162
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:57,641
...he/she should not go alone
down the street at these hours.

163
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:00,917
It returned home of the work.

164
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:02,645
Does he/she work until so late?

165
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,566
To what is he/she devoted?

166
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,475
Guess it.

167
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,000
You are an actress.
- How clever it is.

168
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:18,201
Now that he/she knows everything
on of me, speak to me of you...

169
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,119
...where does he/she work?
- Me?

170
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,124
Because he/she will see...
- No, don't tell it to me.

171
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:27,443
In a bank?
- No.

172
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:31,003
We will see,
in Greenwich Village is artists.

173
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:33,203
I knew him/her in Greenwich Village.

174
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,678
Are you an artist, not?

175
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:36,796
Well...

176
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:41,083
Yes. Yes, I am painting.
- It was clear, a painter.

177
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,600
I love painting.

178
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,723
To think that I took it
for a cashier.

179
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:45,843
Good...

180
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,517
He/she knows the galleries
of the Fifth Avenue?

181
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:49,756
They have some prices.

182
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:53,442
A very small square
it cost but of 50.000 dollars.

183
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:54,926
It was of...

184
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,839
Sesan.
- Cezanne.

185
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,043
A French great painter.

186
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,285
I would love it
to have that square.

187
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:04,361
Ah, yes?

188
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,037
For that heap of dollars?

189
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:11,524
Good, it cannot put on price
to works teachers like that.

190
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:13,522
They are worth...

191
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:16,122
In short, what one can pay
for them.

192
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,879
For sure I saw his square
and I eat he/she didn't know him/her...

193
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,878
Next time
I will look for their name.

194
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,116
No, no, not.

195
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:25,845
I don't usually sell
my squares, Kitty.

196
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,359
He/she doesn't sell them in New York.

197
00:14:28,527 --> 00:14:29,846
Good, me...
- I already know it.

198
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:33,524
For sure he/she sells their squares
in Europe, in Paris or something like that.

199
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,117
I admit that I don't know
anything of painting.

200
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:39,205
Comely to that pay him/her so much
for their squares in France...

201
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:41,517
...as to the French
here in New York.

202
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,964
Nobody is prophet in their earth.

203
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,683
Good, it is a point of view.

204
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,764
In fact, when I paint
I never think of the money.

205
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:53,961
To put on makeup has a good time.
- Does he/she have a good time him/her?

206
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,322
Yes, seriously, painting
it is as more I have a good time.

207
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:59,803
God willing he/she had more time
to make it.

208
00:15:00,127 --> 00:15:02,800
Is it that he/she doesn't have it?
- No, good...

209
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,083
He/she will see, me... my...

210
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,082
In short...

211
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,243
...the businesses
they occupy me a lot of time.

212
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,318
It doesn't miss me,
if they pay him/her so much.

213
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,043
Tell me, what it works
is it representing?

214
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,767
I have already finished.
- What does it work it was?

215
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,325
Well... What time is it?

216
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:28,686
It is only ten to both.
- Only?

217
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:32,360
It is hour that Kitty
go to the bed.

218
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,438
So that I don't forget.

219
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,316
Thank you.

220
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,246
Do I see it again?
- Yes, clear, why not?

221
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,522
Does he/she give me their telephone number?
- Not I have telephone.

222
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:47,756
Can I write him/her?

223
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,519
That is the address,
good night.

224
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,918
Kitty, who is Johnny?

225
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,040
Why does he/she ask me that?

226
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,197
He/she has asked to the barman
for him, not?

227
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,244
Yes, the boyfriend
of my friend Millie, does remember?

228
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,795
He/she is the girl that lives with me.
Good night.

229
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:05,402
Good night.

230
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:43,366
Christopher.

231
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:49,275
Christopher.

232
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:53,275
Yes, Adele.

233
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,885
Chris, you invited me.

234
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,120
My wife...

235
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,277
In short, I am glad to see you.

236
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,358
How well we spend it last night,
truth?

237
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:16,961
Tell me Charlie,
at what time did we return home?

238
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:19,197
After midnight, not?

239
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:23,484
You know that still
I have not gone to bed.

240
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,443
Ah, not?

241
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,563
Not I am so old
as he/she thought, hey Charlie?

242
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:27,716
No.

243
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,966
He/she hears, now I have
that to scrub the plates.

244
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:33,720
Don't you care it, Charlie?
- No, no, ahead.

245
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,243
Has this painted it you?

246
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,963
No, please, it is not a square,
it is an insult.

247
00:17:48,087 --> 00:17:50,237
It is taken out of a picture.
- Who is?

248
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:53,518
He/she is the deceased of my...

249
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:56,963
Your wife's first husband.

250
00:17:57,047 --> 00:18:00,835
The sergeant detective Higgins,
Homer Higgins.

251
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:03,802
Chris,
is that medal authentic?

252
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:06,960
Yes, they gave it to Adele.

253
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:09,679
To your wife?
- Yes.

254
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:12,397
When he drowned
in East River.

255
00:18:14,247 --> 00:18:15,805
It was terrible.

256
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:18,564
Not they found their cadaver.

257
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:21,401
What it punishes.

258
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:23,086
Yes, a pain.

259
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,358
Thank You, Charlie.
- Of anything.

260
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:38,877
How long do you take married?

261
00:18:40,087 --> 00:18:41,566
Five years.

262
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,042
You will see...

263
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,202
Adele didn't want to spend
the money of the insurance...

264
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:50,562
...so he/she rented a room.

265
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,399
Four dollars a week.

266
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,445
And I was about saving money
to buy paintings...

267
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:57,596
...and it interested me.

268
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,365
She was very kind.

269
00:19:00,927 --> 00:19:03,157
Then I was well.

270
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,720
And...

271
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:09,683
You already know
as they are these things.

272
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:11,721
Do you want one?

273
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:13,726
Well...

274
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:15,919
...it will be better than not.

275
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:22,445
Where are your squares?

276
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:24,438
They are there out
in the lobby.

277
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:26,916
Do you want to see those that I made?
- Yes, yes indeed.

278
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,837
Where you found
a flower like that?

279
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,996
You mean that you see this
when you look at that?

280
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:56,161
Because yes, yes. It is simply
imagination question.

281
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:59,559
You will see, when I look at that flower
I sit down something as...

282
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:02,677
Not even
I can enter in my bathroom.

283
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:06,925
He/she Forgives, Adele.

284
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,359
It will be better than we leave.

285
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:17,846
You can already enter.

286
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,601
Why the day you spend
in the sofa, lazy?

287
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:08,115
They come here.

288
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,643
Is all that you can make?

289
00:21:12,847 --> 00:21:14,838
Not you do think of another thing, hey?

290
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,157
In what you want him to think,
if not?

291
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:25,199
If he/she wants more heating here,
young lady...

292
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:28,006
...he/she will have to call to the porter.
- Not be joker.

293
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:30,085
Not you do have anything to tell me?

294
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:32,755
Not I want to speak
of Saturday at night.

295
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:36,596
I don't refer a Saturday
at night, I speak to you of this.

296
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,521
It seems the note of a student
that he/she wants to tie.

297
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:43,563
You are perverting a minor.

298
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:45,799
At what do you laugh?
- Of you.

299
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,718
It is so old
that he/she could be my father.

300
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:51,886
It is the type that he/she went in my help
on Saturday for the night, my hero.

301
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:53,602
Don't tell me.

302
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:57,364
Do you see it? You were too much
drunkard to remember it.

303
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,722
Of not having deceived the agent
he/she would have caught.

304
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,203
So the type that defended you.

305
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:03,920
Is it painting?

306
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:07,598
And rich, very famous,
besides charming.

307
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,958
I would not shake as you.

308
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:12,637
He/she had the opportunity
of winning a departure.

309
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:14,718
He/she only needed 50 dollars...

310
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:16,644
...and you what you brought me?
15 dollars.

311
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:19,400
It is all that he/she had.

312
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:22,047
Also, you had me waiting
two hours under the rain.

313
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,525
You looked at me in a bad way.
- I didn't look at you in a bad way.

314
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,435
He/she hears, any girl
that he/she waits to a type two hours...

315
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:30,597
...under the rain
he/she looks at it in a bad way.

316
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,925
Do you know which your problem is?
That you don't have imagination.

317
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:40,359
What do you want him to make?
- I want you to use the head.

318
00:22:41,887 --> 00:22:44,196
Not you understand that that type
is coladito for you?

319
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:47,404
It is our opportunity.
Does it make a lot of money, not?

320
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:49,717
According to you 50.000 turkeys for square,
anything less.

321
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,603
While I break the head
to gather some capital...

322
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:55,439
...to you you are presented this.

323
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:58,037
Not you have why to call
to that other bird...

324
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,879
...for 50 dollars of shit.

325
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,964
The old one is crazy for you.

326
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,158
Write him/her, propose him/her an appointment.

327
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:07,284
I would be unable to take out him/her money
to that poor man.

328
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:12,077
He/she hears, he/she also thinks of me.

329
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,840
It uses your intelligence,
I know to types riquísimos...

330
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:17,919
...and with half of intelligence
of the one that I have me...

331
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,919
...but, as what does it serve the brain?

332
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:22,680
To make money
it is necessary to have money, capital.

333
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,485
The colleagues
of the shop of cars...

334
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,922
...they would accept me as partner
if takes the pasta.

335
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,726
How much money do they want?
- Three or four thousand.

336
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:31,202
Caray!

337
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:32,800
Nobody gives you anything.

338
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,526
I already know that it is a lot of money,
it uses the imagination.

339
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,482
As soon as you enter
in a business as that...

340
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,842
...then it is easy
to get rid of the partners.

341
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,199
And then you make yourself the master.

342
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,562
Johnny, you have a lot of fantasy.

343
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:47,720
And of the what a pasta?

344
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:50,566
Can maybe get
50 or 100 dollars...

345
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:53,480
...but never a sum as that,
he/she would not know how.

346
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:56,715
Johnny!

347
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:59,960
Johnny, where do you go?
- Not I can lose the time.

348
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:02,123
Johnny, Johnny...

349
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:09,360
Not I know why
I am so laundry for you.

350
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,239
Yes, undoubtedly you know it.

351
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:13,805
What do you say of my proposal?

352
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,723
We go,
you won't have to pluck it.

353
00:24:17,807 --> 00:24:19,035
Not at the beginning.

354
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,640
You should get
a decent apartment.

355
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,525
A place to which he/she feels like go to
to see you, don't unite pigpen like this.

356
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:25,840
What do you say, lazy?

357
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:30,685
Can I enter in my house?
- Hello, ugly face.

358
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:32,686
Why you don't settle here,
Johnny?

359
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,519
I will charge this way you the rent.
- Please, Millie.

360
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,838
He/she stops to enter with my fiancé.
- How is that word written?

361
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:39,963
It is written with "F" of ugly.

362
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:42,165
Does Kitty pay the half, not?

363
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:44,403
That is what we agree
when signing the contract.

364
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:47,395
For me you can stay
with the apartment.

365
00:24:47,807 --> 00:24:49,035
I last with him.

366
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:57,556
What has he/she meant?
- Anything, you already know Johnny.

367
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:58,995
Yes, I know him/her too much.

368
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,758
He/she has already bought you
the ring of commitment?

369
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:04,157
That seems to worry
more than to me.

370
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,158
A model of 45 turkeys.

371
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:17,085
Roger left it to me in 18
and above it still won.

372
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,676
Not you were modeling strips
for the catalog?

373
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,161
It is this way.

374
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,719
I have eaten too much.

375
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,880
If they return the corsets,
I swear to stop to be model.

376
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,445
Why don't you want to work?

377
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,565
With that figure.
If was not so lazy.

378
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:40,436
Who you believe that you are,
my guardian angel?

379
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:43,884
What he/she goes, rich, I lost the wings
a long time ago.

380
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:45,721
It is evident.

381
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,438
It doesn't miss me that says goodbye to you.

382
00:25:48,887 --> 00:25:50,559
Not you arrived on time
to the work...

383
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:52,638
...since you knew Johnny.

384
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:55,481
Treasure, what has he/she spent?

385
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:58,277
What you would want
that passes you.

386
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:00,523
I am in love,
crazily in love.

387
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,723
Of somebody that mistreats you
as to a load animal.

388
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:03,842
Don't enter with Johnny.

389
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:05,679
You could choose the man
that wants.

390
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,884
Clear,
and it is him to the one that I want.

391
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:10,686
He/she will make of you a lost one.

392
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,962
Not you would get love
although gives you in the face.

393
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:15,402
If it is there where he/she gave you,
you should know it.

394
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,157
I would like to sing
as that sparrow.

395
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:08,081
There up there are two,
they are building a nest.

396
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,245
Where have you learned that?

397
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:19,720
I learned it being boy.

398
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:22,437
He/she already makes almost 40 years
that he/she didn't whistle.

399
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:24,965
Today I sit down as a boy.

400
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,759
You have sold some square
lately?

401
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:31,836
No.

402
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:33,958
Why you don't paint me
a portrait?

403
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,566
I would like it.

404
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:37,998
I can take the easel
to your apartment?

405
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:40,123
Not I believe that to my friend
he likes.

406
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:42,125
How long
does it take you to paint a square?

407
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:45,766
Sometimes one day,
sometimes one year.

408
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:48,122
One cannot say,
a square goes sprouting.

409
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,278
It is that a square
can it sprout?

410
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:51,601
The feeling yes.

411
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:54,083
That is the important thing,
the feeling.

412
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:57,284
And me, for example, good,
to me nobody taught me to draw.

413
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,445
I trace a line around
of what I sit down when seeing the things.

414
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:01,956
Yes, I understand.

415
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,162
It is as...

416
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,280
...to fall in love, I suppose.

417
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,166
You already know.

418
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:12,837
You know somebody that
he/she leaves making important...

419
00:28:13,447 --> 00:28:15,483
...until you cannot happen
without him.

420
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:16,841
Interesting.

421
00:28:17,647 --> 00:28:19,683
I believe that the art is this way.

422
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:23,598
Each square can be
a history of love.

423
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,161
He/she had never heard speak
to anybody in that way.

424
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,082
Good...

425
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,281
...neither there are a lot of people
to the one that can be spoken this way.

426
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:34,805
One is quiet it.

427
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,716
He/she keeps it inside
as a secret.

428
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,240
Yes, exact.

429
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,083
That is in fact
what passes me.

430
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:45,277
I have to be quiet
many things.

431
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,440
The certain thing is that I am in a mess.

432
00:28:50,087 --> 00:28:51,964
You, Kitty?
- Have not you noticed it?

433
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:53,116
I am without a cent.

434
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:56,279
This dress Millie lent it to me,
and I owe him/her the rent.

435
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:00,444
Tell me how much it is.
- Forget it.

436
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:02,883
Not I should mention it.

437
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:07,635
I bothered you the day.
- Kitty, me...

438
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:08,716
I will already get ready them.

439
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:10,718
Not it could accept
anything of you, Chris.

440
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:13,800
No, if...
- No, no, it would not rot.

441
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:17,126
I never requested money to a man
and I won't make it now.

442
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,403
Not I want to ruin
our friendship.

443
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:20,955
Kitty, please.

444
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:22,566
Not it could return it to you.

445
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:27,086
Chris!

446
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,365
Maybe yes it can return it.

447
00:29:29,447 --> 00:29:31,119
If you pay the rent
of a study...

448
00:29:31,207 --> 00:29:35,166
...he/she would have where to live and you
could you paint, do you understand it?

449
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:38,084
You could paint my portrait.

450
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,046
What does it happen?

451
00:29:44,647 --> 00:29:46,638
Not you do want to paint my portrait?

452
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:48,843
I have to tell you something.
- What?

453
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:51,358
I have deceived you.

454
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:52,995
I lied you.

455
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,479
I am a married man, Kitty.

456
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:03,003
And why didn't you tell it to me?

457
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:07,125
Not I am of the class of women
that they go out with married men.

458
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,767
You remember that Preposition
of knowing somebody...

459
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:13,763
...of how it begins to like you...

460
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:15,838
...until you only think of him?

461
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:19,443
You should say me
that you had a wife.

462
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:23,000
Not I am in love with her.
- But you married.

463
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,443
It felt very alone,
it could not support the solitude.

464
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:29,720
Poor Chris.

465
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:32,285
Not you are mad with me?

466
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:35,723
He should be,
however, he am not.

467
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:38,279
With you not, Chris.

468
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,166
I will let you to help me.

469
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,841
How much do you need?
- 500 dollars.

470
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:49,961
500...

471
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,562
I need 500 dollars.

472
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:39,157
It could return 10 every week.

473
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:41,045
It is well, Mister Cross.

474
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,039
Although a guarantee will need.

475
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:45,477
No, thank you.
- Somebody solvent?

476
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:48,316
Do pay?
- Pure formulismo.

477
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,883
Thank you.
- At your disposal.

478
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,116
And that tight of Hogarth...

479
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,004
...why it cannot go up you
the salary?

480
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,601
You not even win it enough
to buy me a radio.

481
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,838
I have to go all the below
nights to listen the serial one.

482
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:07,760
I don't make more than to save...

483
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:10,077
...and you wear out it
in paintings and canvases.

484
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:12,758
Not I know what you will make
without me.

485
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:14,560
My dear Homer.

486
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:17,161
If has a tomb
where to take you flowers.

487
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,758
You were not even capable
of declaring you.

488
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:23,078
I had to put on the words
in the mouth. God willing follows widow.

489
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:26,681
I support you
because we are married.

490
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:29,725
You have me full.
- Yes, I am also full.

491
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:32,119
Have you been drinking?

492
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,080
No, neither a swig.

493
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:35,839
It lets him to smell you the encouragement.

494
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:41,879
Then, what does he/she spend?
Why are you speaking this way to me?

495
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:44,037
Always censoring
that he/she doesn't buy you a radio.

496
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,800
You believe that I like to lower all
the nights to listen the radio?

497
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:50,004
You buy it, you have money.
- The money of their insurance?

498
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:52,039
I don't want a radio,
but you.

499
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:55,199
I will never play those funds,
I keep them for my age.

500
00:32:56,127 --> 00:32:58,118
Homer would have bought me
a radio.

501
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:00,721
He/she had a good salary
and it provided me a house.

502
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:03,444
You continue in the same one
apartment, not?

503
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,995
Yes, but then
he/she didn't smell of painting.

504
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:09,204
Not I hit eye with that damned scent.

505
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,278
Not I want to see the lobby
full with squares.

506
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:12,641
If you don't come undone of them...

507
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:14,922
...I assure you that I will give them to him
to a chamarilero.

508
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,526
Adele...
- Yes.

509
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:20,960
I swear you that I will make it.

510
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,086
For the things that you paint.

511
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,880
Already bad eras when you copied
post cards.

512
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:30,676
Uti? copied post cards
and he/she is considered a great painter.

513
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:34,437
Already, I suppose that you are copying
to Utrié or like he/she calls himself that.

514
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:37,396
Every time you are crazier, yes.

515
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,885
Not there is more than to see
that makes.

516
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:42,037
Strange Flores, snakes...

517
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:44,802
You only lack to paint
to a naked woman.

518
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:46,764
I have never seen
to a naked woman.

519
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:48,838
It would lack more, that waits.

520
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:55,956
Date hurry.

521
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:58,038
The Hour of the Happy Home
it will already begin, lover.

522
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:02,320
Under at once, Dora,
Sr. Cross has arrived late.

523
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:06,722
He/she comes.

524
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,244
When you end up,
he/she washes the plates.

525
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:11,406
<Bobby speaks to them Taylor... >

526
00:34:11,487 --> 00:34:13,443
<... presenting>
<The Hour of the Happy Home... >

527
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:16,519
<... sponsored by the products>
<of cleaning Norris. >

528
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,403
<Any product of cleaning>
<he/she will give so much shine to their home... >

529
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:24,123
<... as the soaps, detergents>
<and zero liquid Norris. >

530
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:27,077
<Request you them>
<to their habitual supplier. >

531
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:31,406
<Listen the chapter 78 of>
<"In search of the happiness." >

532
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:34,003
<As they will remember, >
<we leave Gilda... >

533
00:34:34,087 --> 00:34:35,440
<... in the mansion>
<of Cooper... >

534
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:37,722
<... when Abygail>
<he/she prepared to leave. >

535
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:17,955
Christopher.

536
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:30,600
Christopher.

537
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,880
What are you making?

538
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:40,441
It was...
It was looking for the newspaper.

539
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:41,960
Are you blind?

540
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,567
What does it happen?
Not you had gone down to hear the radio?

541
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,564
It was ruined exactly in the best thing,
that apparatus is a junk.

542
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:55,203
Have you read this news?
- Which?

543
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:57,325
A murder in Queens.

544
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:00,157
A man killed his wife
with a paperweight...

545
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:02,363
...it put their body in a trunk
and he/she sent it to California.

546
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:04,802
Here he/she says that he/she had...
- I have read the newspaper, thank you.

547
00:36:05,447 --> 00:36:07,165
He/she won't get rid of the punishment.

548
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:09,283
He/she will go to the electric seat,
you will already see it.

549
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:13,157
Yes, with the inspectors of
New York didn't have escape.

550
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,836
Why you don't leave the newspaper
and do you wash the plates?

551
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:34,436
Adele...

552
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,245
...you would not speak seriously
when you said...

553
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:39,045
...that you would give him/her my squares
to a chamarilero?

554
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:40,560
Of course.

555
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,922
Because you won't have to make it.

556
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,562
My friend
he/she plans to rent a study...

557
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:56,002
...in Greenwich Village,
I will take them there.

558
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:59,204
Good, if he/she is the enough idiot
as to allow it...

559
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:01,005
...ahead.
- Woman!

560
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:08,882
It is the last floor,
he/she has a lot of light and it is cheap.

561
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:11,921
They have heard speak
of Tony Riverside the designer?

562
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,836
He/she rented the apartment
during three years.

563
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:16,878
Not he/she could work in another place.

564
00:37:17,607 --> 00:37:19,837
Do they come? This was their study.

565
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:22,883
These drawings
they belong to Tony Riverside.

566
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,205
He/she used to make that
with their models...

567
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,323
...when he/she worked
in some cover.

568
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:30,162
Today they would pay a fortune
for them.

569
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:32,405
Is artist, young lady March?

570
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,881
Where is the bedroom?
- Here.

571
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,358
How much the rent is,
Mister Johnson?

572
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:45,962
150. Tony Riverside left
some things in the basement.

573
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:48,561
Van with the apartment
if they want to use them.

574
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,759
Here the bedroom is.

575
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,364
I don't like anything the paper.

576
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,126
Will they paper it?

577
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:01,843
Good, if he/she rents it one year.

578
00:38:02,207 --> 00:38:03,845
The paper will choose it me.

579
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:56,478
He/she stops to poke in the handbag.

580
00:38:58,247 --> 00:38:59,680
Hello, lazy.

581
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:02,281
He/she has looked like each other to hear the bell.

582
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,279
Because I have not heard anything.

583
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:12,204
Is this all that you have?

584
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:15,717
With what you spent last night,
you are lucky that it is that.

585
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:18,844
Until you bought me a book.

586
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,117
According to you,
do you want to be an actress, not?

587
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:24,236
To interpret
to William Shakespeare.

588
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:33,319
It is as much as I have left.

589
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:36,120
You will know how to get more,
hey, lazy?

590
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:40,200
He/she said that he/she made a lot
that he/she didn't sell squares.

591
00:39:41,407 --> 00:39:43,637
And he/she has paid me all this.

592
00:39:58,607 --> 00:39:59,756
He/she Looks, Kitty.

593
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,763
I need at least1.000 dollars.

594
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:08,322
To that you have already softened it,
no?

595
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:09,761
Now press him/her.

596
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:13,121
It seems uncomfortable
when I speak to him/her of money.

597
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:15,763
Beautiful, you have it
about to candy.

598
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,997
It is already hooked,
it cannot come unfastened.

599
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:21,165
Could he/she leave me, not?
- Not forget to their wife.

600
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,876
Insinuate him/her that her
it could find out everything...

601
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,605
...and you will already see like he/she reacts.

602
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:27,126
That calls you blackmail.

603
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:30,364
He/she could only call himself blackmail,
small...

604
00:40:30,447 --> 00:40:32,358
...if you allow to catch.

605
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,442
Is he?
- I told you that he/she had heard the bell.

606
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,356
Damned it is, come undone of him.

607
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:14,526
Go...

608
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:16,966
Not you do answer to the bell?

609
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:19,515
And you were not mad?
- It is a truce.

610
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:21,484
Whisky?
- Thank you, treasure.

611
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:24,237
He/she knew that you were,
it is hardly twelve o'clock.

612
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,558
I lowered again
and I saw the open door.

613
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:29,764
Go, go, go...

614
00:41:32,327 --> 00:41:34,045
Not it is bad
for a small poor person.

615
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:35,845
Not begin another time with that.

616
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:43,718
Don't tell me
that it is under the bed.

617
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:44,922
No, lover.

618
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,520
You can leave, Johnny.

619
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:51,358
Not you had more than to call,
ugly face.

620
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,957
Have you guessed right in the careers?

621
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:58,321
It could be.

622
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:01,721
The last time that I saw you
you spoke of leaving to Hollywood.

623
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:03,445
It is possible that he/she still makes it.

624
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:06,997
I read somewhere around that a type left
to Hollywood without a cent...

625
00:42:07,207 --> 00:42:09,675
...and it won a million,
and callow.

626
00:42:09,807 --> 00:42:12,799
That yes, it was handsome,
he/she worked in a supermarket.

627
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,318
If he/she worked
he/she didn't resemble you.

628
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:18,281
Do you want to stop to discuss?
- Not we are discussing.

629
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,119
It is that Millie doesn't have neither he/she devises.

630
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,526
They say that to the actors...

631
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,438
...they pay them five or ten thousand
dollars per week...

632
00:42:23,527 --> 00:42:24,846
...to make what?

633
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:27,395
To be made the five pesetas,
to shake the girls.

634
00:42:27,487 --> 00:42:28,761
Cannot I maybe make it me?

635
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,366
If it is this way, why don't you make it?

636
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:34,236
He/she can that he/she makes it,
give me time.

637
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:43,437
Chris!

638
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,518
I have brought some
of my things, Kitty.

639
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:47,845
Tomorrow I will bring more.

640
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:50,365
And the rest on Saturday.

641
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:56,358
You have company.
- They Are Millie and Johnny.

642
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,166
Johnny...
- The boyfriend of Millie.

643
00:42:58,247 --> 00:42:59,566
I will present them to you.

644
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:03,077
Millie, this he/she is a friend,
Chris Cross, Millie Ray.

645
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,727
How is it, young lady Ray?
- Charmed, Mister Cross.

646
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:09,117
And Johnny Prince.
- Charmed, Mister Cross.

647
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,161
How is it?

648
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:15,443
We have not seen each other
in some part?

649
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:18,235
It could be, it could be,
Mister Cross.

650
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:19,317
Yes.

651
00:43:20,407 --> 00:43:23,638
And I am not able to remember it,
perhaps make a mistake.

652
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:25,003
Perhaps.

653
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:28,963
Good, I already leave, Kitty.
- I will accompany you, ugly face.

654
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:31,606
Don't bother you, Johnny.

655
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,082
Not you will think
that I will allow you to go alone?

656
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:36,558
It could run over you a tram.

657
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:43,235
Good-bye, Mister Cross,
it was a pleasure.

658
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:46,796
Thank you for the whisky, Millie.
- Of anything, good-bye.

659
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:49,717
Until soon, Kitty.
- Until soon, Johnny.

660
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,005
Does it happen you something, Chris?

661
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:58,766
The truth, your friend Johnny
it has just liked me.

662
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:00,520
Johnny is a good type.

663
00:44:00,687 --> 00:44:03,121
Yes, clear, otherwise
he/she would not be your friend.

664
00:44:03,887 --> 00:44:06,879
There is something in him that...
- Millie is crazy for him.

665
00:44:09,167 --> 00:44:12,398
You would like to toss
a glance to my squares?

666
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:15,122
Still not.
They come to sit down.

667
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:19,881
Are you happy?

668
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:23,604
For the first time in my life.
- Very happy?

669
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:26,599
I think all the time of you.

670
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:30,117
I am always wanting to see you,
to have you close.

671
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:34,523
I know that I am not entitled
to wonder it...

672
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:36,723
...however,
at some time there are...?

673
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:41,118
Without a doubt,
there were other men in your life.

674
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,280
Only one, Chris.

675
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:49,245
Do you still see him/her?

676
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,282
I have forgotten him/her.

677
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:57,441
He/she looks, Kitty, if was single...

678
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:00,840
...and if he/she didn't have a wife...
- But you have it.

679
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:02,883
Yes, I already know it, but if her...

680
00:45:04,407 --> 00:45:07,524
Good, if happens something
that liberates me...

681
00:45:09,527 --> 00:45:11,040
...would you marry me?

682
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,078
Now don't speak of that,
lover.

683
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,885
The most urgent thing
it is that it gets an employment.

684
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:17,197
This life is expensive.

685
00:45:17,287 --> 00:45:19,721
Not he/she wanted to request you he/she swims...

686
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:23,322
...because I know that you have not sold
any square lately.

687
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:25,759
Not you do have enough money?

688
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:28,202
Not you know the difficult thing that it is
to find work as actress.

689
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:31,165
The talent doesn't count for anything,
recommendation is needed.

690
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:32,646
You should know
to some fat fish...

691
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,843
...that an agent takes you
and that hill money.

692
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:38,203
It is needed clothes and those things.
- Kitty, you are beautiful.

693
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:43,202
Chris, the beauty is not everything,
treasure.

694
00:45:43,647 --> 00:45:46,844
It is the clothes, perfumes,
the impression that you cause.

695
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:49,920
He/she would need a thousand dollars
only for dresses.

696
00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:52,716
A thousand dollars?
- As a little.

697
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:56,595
Perhaps he/she requests them to Millie
or to their boyfriend Johnny.

698
00:45:57,807 --> 00:45:59,638
ÉI has a lot of money.

699
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:03,244
No, no, no, Kitty.
To Johnny no way.

700
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,436
Why not?

701
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:08,797
I will get you the money
as it is.

702
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,442
Treasure, you are adorable.

703
00:46:12,807 --> 00:46:15,196
I begin to believe
that you are in love with me.

704
00:46:15,527 --> 00:46:17,279
He am, Kitty, and a lot.

705
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:23,205
Chris, you are very impetuous.

706
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,559
I know that you like,
but there are certain limits.

707
00:46:26,647 --> 00:46:28,000
Yes, I know it.

708
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,197
I have to leave,
I have that...

709
00:46:33,687 --> 00:46:35,678
I will return at noon tomorrow,
Kitty.

710
00:46:35,807 --> 00:46:39,277
I will be waiting for you.
I set that you have to leave.

711
00:46:43,207 --> 00:46:44,560
Good-bye, Chris.

712
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:50,556
Not forget the money.
- I will get it.

713
00:46:54,927 --> 00:46:56,963
Good-bye, my life.
- Good-bye.

714
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:46,366
I don't understand it.

715
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:48,964
That unhappy one should be crazy.

716
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:51,003
A snake in the high one.

717
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:54,916
Somebody exists
able to pay for this reason?

718
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:58,883
He/she hears, you are sure that
a humbug is not?

719
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:02,002
It is too silly
to be a humbug.

720
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:05,284
In that you are right.
- How would it get the money?

721
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:09,116
If has to be won it, not him
they would give more than 50 a week.

722
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:11,757
Not you have neither art idea.

723
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:14,606
Maybe not, but that believes
that he/she has arrangement.

724
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,844
This it doesn't displease me.

725
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,318
Have you seen flowers like this?

726
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,842
I wonder if he/she could sell
these squares.

727
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:25,361
And what I tell him/her when
do let us wonder where they are?

728
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,005
Tell him/her that they are
in a guardamuebles.

729
00:48:27,087 --> 00:48:28,406
You have to protect them.

730
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:30,205
Not you can leave
some squares of value...

731
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:31,845
...where anyone
it could be taken them.

732
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:34,566
It is chancy, any
expert would recognize them.

733
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:40,122
Today he/she has tried to kiss me
and I have not liked that.

734
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:42,279
They have already kissed you other times.

735
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:45,447
He/she hears, they are not even signed.

736
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:48,044
That what it cares,
they are known.

737
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,765
Not where I will take them.

738
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:53,442
Johnny, I don't support that he/she plays me
nobody more than you.

739
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,997
It disturbs me that I looks at myself
in that way.

740
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,882
If was cruel or vicious
or if screams me, it would be different.

741
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:03,326
You don't love me.

742
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:05,638
If you loved me you would understand me.

743
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:07,519
No?
- No.

744
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:20,322
And now, what?

745
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:23,282
Good, maybe yes.

746
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:31,724
Making overtimes,
Mister Cross?

747
00:49:31,807 --> 00:49:34,401
I am about to leave, Ben,
I already leave alone you.

748
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:35,761
You don't bother.

749
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,605
I have caught him/her exactly on time.

750
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:22,767
Change me this check,
does he/she want, Chris? It is personal.

751
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,400
Yes, yes, of course, J.J.

752
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,087
Here he/she has.
- Thank You, Chris.

753
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:52,645
Good night.
- Good night.

754
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:04,646
Hello, Nick.
- Hello.

755
00:51:15,967 --> 00:51:17,195
What do you bring there?

756
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:23,040
To the one that paints these squares
they give him/her 50.000 turkeys for each one.

757
00:51:25,607 --> 00:51:27,165
What is it what spends, Nick?

758
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,357
From where you took out them,
of Washington Square?

759
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:32,803
The hippies of Village
they sell these messes...

760
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:34,366
...for the price of the cloth.

761
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:36,517
This didn't paint it any hippie
of Village.

762
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:39,717
That is my house of zeals,
no?

763
00:51:39,927 --> 00:51:42,964
And that snake
he/she comes directly from Bronx.

764
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:45,197
That type lives in Brooklyn,
it is famous.

765
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:47,039
Yes, how does he/she call himself?
- Well...

766
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:50,479
He/she hears, I have brought you other things and
you have never requested me names.

767
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:54,596
They were jewels, he/she brings another gender
and we will continue making businesses.

768
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:58,480
Take you this to Washington Square
where you found it.

769
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:41,042
I see that he/she has good eye
for the art.

770
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:44,158
It is one of my best squares.

771
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:45,641
And this, how's it going?

772
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:48,883
Not he/she knew that was
you painter.

773
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:50,195
I am not it.

774
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:56,518
Are they good?
- Well...

775
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:58,646
...they have something.

776
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:02,044
A characteristic...

777
00:53:02,927 --> 00:53:05,202
...peculiar,
the perspective.

778
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,837
Is it important?
- Yes indeed that yes.

779
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:09,800
Look at my squares.

780
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:11,920
Where did he/she buy them?

781
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:13,725
I didn't buy them,
I want to sell them.

782
00:53:13,807 --> 00:53:15,525
He/she wants that you the bandage
for a commission.

783
00:53:15,607 --> 00:53:18,519
How much does he/she believe that they are worth?
- I begin requesting 25.

784
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:21,880
Then, he/she already knows,
to sell squares is bad business.

785
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,644
Nowadays
people don't buy art.

786
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:28,121
Not there is sensibility,
neither good pleasure, neither proportion.

787
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:29,795
Neither perspective.

788
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,238
Leave me their name
and their address.

789
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:38,875
I will return later, good-bye.

790
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:47,046
Hello, Johnny.
- Hello, Tiny.

791
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,885
Who has given you that?

792
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:54,602
Nick.

793
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:56,405
And what is there of my ring?

794
00:53:57,407 --> 00:54:00,285
Do you know what costs a brilliant one?
- I gave you 900 dollars.

795
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:02,440
Do you want to lower the voice?

796
00:54:10,407 --> 00:54:12,284
You have told me
that that old one is silly.

797
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:14,920
He/she can that you are it you.

798
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:19,202
He/she said that those squares
they were worth a lot of pasta.

799
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:22,281
Did you bother yourself in checking it?
- What does it happen?

800
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:26,516
They are only worth 25 dollars
each one, that it is their price.

801
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:28,479
You have become crazy.

802
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:32,805
Don't provoke me, small.
- Don't get angry.

803
00:54:32,967 --> 00:54:35,037
Then you don't call me crazy.

804
00:54:41,447 --> 00:54:43,244
That old one is a humbug.

805
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,605
Does he/she have money, not?

806
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:48,281
And if he/she requests it borrowed
or are their savings?

807
00:54:48,527 --> 00:54:50,563
Perhaps he/she steals it.
- To steal it?

808
00:54:50,647 --> 00:54:52,683
What do you say?
Not it is their style.

809
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:54,280
He/she would never dare to steal.

810
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:55,959
Because it doesn't win it
with their squares.

811
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:57,799
Maybe be silly,
but he/she knows about art.

812
00:54:57,887 --> 00:54:59,878
The day of the museum
he/she explained to me many things.

813
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,117
It is very clever,
people stopped.

814
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:06,202
What museum?
- Metropolitan.

815
00:55:06,447 --> 00:55:09,439
Caray, there is squares
that they are worth millions.

816
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:15,916
Where do you go?

817
00:55:21,687 --> 00:55:23,803
I will make you be
in ridiculous, lazy.

818
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,878
Not you can take their squares
to the museum.

819
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:27,446
Who does that say?

820
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:43,925
Does he/she know who has bought them?

821
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,158
Janeway, Damon Janeway.

822
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,202
Not he/she does know who Sr is. Janeway?
- No.

823
00:55:50,287 --> 00:55:51,515
An art critic.

824
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:54,926
The biggest authority in
modern art of New York.

825
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:57,717
He/she saw them and he/she bought them both.

826
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,923
He/she not even noticed mine.

827
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:01,076
Neither to look at them.

828
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:02,965
He/she wants to put on in contact
with you.

829
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:05,641
He/she told me that calls him/her,
you wait a moment.

830
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:06,762
No...

831
00:56:22,207 --> 00:56:23,276
Forgive.

832
00:56:27,047 --> 00:56:28,924
Tell me,
what does he/she make you so much grace?

833
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:30,965
You, treasure.

834
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:34,241
You are the clever one that went
to leave me in ridiculous.

835
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:35,680
To make fun of me.

836
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,846
You have sold two squares
for 10 cents each one...

837
00:56:39,927 --> 00:56:42,600
...and now you cannot get paid.
- He/she shuts up.

838
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,761
My God.
- What does it happen now?

839
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,122
How will I say it to Chris?
- He/she won't find out.

840
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:51,562
For sure if that Janeway
he/she is a critic...

841
00:56:51,647 --> 00:56:53,000
...he/she writes in a newspaper.

842
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:55,601
We will enter in a mess,
I told you that doesn't make it.

843
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:57,236
Don't become nervous.

844
00:56:57,327 --> 00:56:59,477
The type to which I sold them to him
he/she doesn't know me of anything.

845
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:01,444
Give me a glass, I need it.

846
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:08,765
Chris?
- No, he has key.

847
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:12,598
He/she walks, see to see who is,
date hurry.

848
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:26,081
You forgive...

849
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:28,636
...we are looking for a man,
I don't know how he/she calls himself.

850
00:57:28,727 --> 00:57:30,638
Then I cannot help him/her.

851
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:33,921
Apologize.

852
00:57:34,007 --> 00:57:35,122
Look.

853
00:57:39,127 --> 00:57:40,560
And this.

854
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,476
It belongs to him.

855
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,440
There it is.

856
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,997
Why it disappeared
in that way?

857
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:54,444
Take,
50 less dollars 20%.

858
00:57:54,527 --> 00:57:56,199
Hear, I don't know of what he/she speaks to me.

859
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:57,606
Of the square that you left me.

860
00:57:57,687 --> 00:58:00,406
It will be better than we show up,
my name is Janeway.

861
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:02,478
This is Mr. Dellarowe.
- Charmed.

862
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:03,682
What is what you/they want?

863
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,997
We would like to know
who painted those squares.

864
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:08,563
Doesn't he/she know it?
- Undoubtedly not.

865
00:58:09,327 --> 00:58:10,965
For that reason we have come.

866
00:58:11,127 --> 00:58:13,038
Please,
if he/she is the painter's friend...

867
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:14,640
...put him/her in contact
with Dellarowe.

868
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:17,366
Why he/she bought them
if he/she doesn't know who has painted them?

869
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,963
Because they are good.
- Who did paint them?

870
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:30,486
No, Johnny, not.

871
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,282
Not be so modest,
dear March.

872
00:58:33,367 --> 00:58:35,244
Do they come it?
They have made me be bad.

873
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:37,124
He/she made me promise
that he/she would not say it.

874
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:39,204
For that reason I faked not to know it.

875
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:44,082
It is very special
regarding their squares.

876
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:47,637
Not it lets him to see them nobody,
they already come that not even the signature.

877
00:58:48,207 --> 00:58:49,401
That has observed.

878
00:58:49,487 --> 00:58:51,318
It is you a great artist,
young lady March.

879
00:58:51,407 --> 00:58:52,920
Oh, not.
- Do they come it?

880
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:55,078
Neither he likes
that it is spoken of it.

881
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,397
It is convinced that
their squares are not worth anything.

882
00:58:57,487 --> 00:58:59,205
For that reason it takes to you
those two...

883
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:02,359
...to give him/her trust,
he/she knew that they were very good.

884
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:04,520
Does it allow me the money?

885
00:59:04,847 --> 00:59:07,122
He/she would never have guessed
that he/she was a woman.

886
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:10,035
Neither me. Their work is
very vigorous, young lady March.

887
00:59:10,127 --> 00:59:12,482
Can we see some more?
- Clear, ahead.

888
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,762
See as much as they want.
- Thank you.

889
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:23,116
You are crazy.
How do you dare to make this?

890
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:25,277
What fright.
I believed that they were policemen.

891
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,483
I know that I make,
those neither they find out.

892
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:28,966
Not I will be able to deceive the critic.

893
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:31,163
You have always wanted to be an actress,
it is your opportunity.

894
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:34,280
Many hours you have happened with
the old one, you already know like speech.

895
00:59:34,407 --> 00:59:37,444
Janeway will swallow it to him, I will tell him/her
that he/she comes to speak with you.

896
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:38,761
No, he/she waits.

897
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:44,480
How long does it take painting?

898
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:46,802
Since he/she was a girl,
Mister Janeway.

899
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:50,040
Did he/she go to some school?
- No, he/she was born with talent.

900
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,876
I believe that I am the only one
that it has encouraged it...

901
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:54,366
...so that it continues ahead.

902
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,601
As friend,
unselfishly.

903
00:59:58,487 --> 01:00:00,557
Non memory their name.
- Prince.

904
01:00:04,007 --> 01:00:06,760
Mr. Janeway,
she is upset.

905
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:10,558
Perhaps if you speak to him/her.

906
01:00:11,247 --> 01:00:12,441
I will attempt it.

907
01:00:19,047 --> 01:00:20,560
Well, Mister Dellarowe.

908
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:26,760
He/she knows if Ms. March
would he/she leave me the squares?

909
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,323
Good, that depends.

910
01:00:29,767 --> 01:00:31,678
What would you give to change?

911
01:00:32,527 --> 01:00:35,519
The prices will go in increase,
however...

912
01:00:44,447 --> 01:00:46,324
In general,
I can say if a square...

913
01:00:46,407 --> 01:00:48,398
...it has been colored
for a man or for a woman...

914
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:50,923
...and you have deceived me,
young lady March.

915
01:00:51,007 --> 01:00:53,601
It is not only original,
he/she has virile force.

916
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:56,279
How long
does it use in a square?

917
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,201
Sometimes one day
and sometimes one year.

918
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:06,435
One cannot say,
a square sprouts.

919
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:08,958
It is a feeling, he/she already knows.

920
01:01:09,327 --> 01:01:12,160
A feeling that sprouts,
as...

921
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:14,883
As falling in love, I suppose.

922
01:01:17,847 --> 01:01:19,405
A good description.

923
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:23,116
In my opinion,
each square if it is good it is...

924
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:25,565
...a history of love.

925
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:28,084
Can I write that?
- No, please.

926
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,361
Non scribe on me.

927
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,718
I fear myself that it will be
a very difficult case.

928
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:34,718
Why he/she doesn't have trust
in their work?

929
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:37,279
Because I don't know how to draw.

930
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,721
He/she doesn't make it bad.

931
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,878
I trace a line
around what I sit down...

932
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:42,446
...when I look at the things.

933
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,801
To speak with you
it is something that comforts me.

934
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:48,155
What? How does that go?

935
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:51,641
We have already broken the ice.

936
01:01:51,727 --> 01:01:53,285
Kitty, Mr. Dellarowe...

937
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:56,518
...he/she wants to have the sole right of
does all your work, find you well?

938
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:58,764
As friend
I advise you that you accept.

939
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:00,485
They can come tomorrow
to the gallery?

940
01:02:00,567 --> 01:02:03,206
To what time?
- To the one that the young lady wants.

941
01:02:04,047 --> 01:02:05,446
What do twelve o'clock find it?

942
01:02:05,527 --> 01:02:07,324
Later
go to eat lunch.

943
01:02:07,407 --> 01:02:09,796
Good, me... Not I know...

944
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:11,801
There it will be.

945
01:02:12,967 --> 01:02:15,800
Their presence has been decisive,
Mister Prince, to encourage her.

946
01:02:17,007 --> 01:02:18,725
I see that it is tired,
young lady March.

947
01:02:18,807 --> 01:02:20,206
It is enough per today.

948
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:22,245
We leave, until tomorrow.

949
01:02:22,327 --> 01:02:24,397
Thank you, Mister Janeway,
good-bye.

950
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:26,282
Good night.

951
01:02:26,527 --> 01:02:28,643
Good night, Sr. Dellarowe.
- Good night.

952
01:02:34,927 --> 01:02:36,280
Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

953
01:02:42,727 --> 01:02:43,796
He/she listens, lazy.

954
01:02:46,407 --> 01:02:47,886
Not I know what you have told him/her
to Janeway...

955
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:49,480
...but you have it in the pocket.

956
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:51,285
He/she won't finish
with the lunch.

957
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,756
Good, and what difference does it make?
- If you refer to...

958
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:55,838
Not continue behaving
as a girl.

959
01:02:58,127 --> 01:03:01,164
Allow it to talk of what wants,
he/she will speak to you of art.

960
01:03:01,607 --> 01:03:03,962
If I was sensible
I would leave your side.

961
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,480
But you are not it.

962
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:26,555
Here below,
as if signs a letter.

963
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:28,840
He/she comes.

964
01:03:30,447 --> 01:03:32,358
Katherine March.
- Kitty?

965
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:35,043
There that is, hide it.

966
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:37,156
Kitty?

967
01:03:40,047 --> 01:03:42,845
Chris!
- Kitty, happened here and...

968
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,719
Hello, Mister Cross,
I have gone up a moment.

969
01:03:48,807 --> 01:03:50,638
I Thought that Millie
it would be at home.

970
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:53,437
He doesn't care him to admire
their squares, not?

971
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:56,717
No, no, at all,
Mister Prince.

972
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:59,441
Excellent work,
it is a magnificent square.

973
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:02,363
He/she has very good perspective,
hey?

974
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:05,764
Yes, it is what I am given better,
the perspective.

975
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:09,322
In short, I already have to leave.

976
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:10,926
Until soon, Mister Cross.

977
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:13,237
If you see Millie
tell him/her that I am in the bar of Tiny.

978
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:15,397
Don't bother you,
I know the road.

979
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:25,365
Does it take a lot of time here?

980
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:26,960
No, why?

981
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:30,486
I don't like it.
- Not he/she is bad person, Chris.

982
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,603
Not I know why reason
you don't like it.

983
01:04:33,727 --> 01:04:35,524
Do tell me, was he?

984
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:37,601
Him, who?

985
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,235
You said that there was a man.

986
01:04:39,327 --> 01:04:40,965
For heaven's sake,
when will you forget that?

987
01:04:41,047 --> 01:04:42,196
Was he?
- No!

988
01:04:42,287 --> 01:04:43,515
Kitty...
- He/she paints if you want.

989
01:04:43,607 --> 01:04:45,598
Not I plan to stay here
so that you torment me.

990
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:23,362
Kitty...

991
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,600
Kitty, please.

992
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:29,037
Leave alone me,
I will have dinner outside!

993
01:05:33,647 --> 01:05:35,046
Kitty, don't get angry.

994
01:05:35,127 --> 01:05:37,687
For that come if always
are we discussing?

995
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,678
I didn't request it to you.
- I beg it to you.

996
01:05:39,967 --> 01:05:41,446
Sacred sky.

997
01:05:41,847 --> 01:05:44,441
Start to paint.
- Not I can.

998
01:05:44,727 --> 01:05:47,116
Not I can paint
when you are mad with me.

999
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:51,521
Do you want me to leave?

1000
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,045
I want you to stay here
painting.

1001
01:06:04,367 --> 01:06:06,801
Chris, I sit down it.

1002
01:06:07,127 --> 01:06:09,800
Why you torment me with
something that belongs to the past?

1003
01:06:10,287 --> 01:06:11,515
Because because...

1004
01:06:13,847 --> 01:06:16,202
Do you want to marry me?
- Not you would rot.

1005
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:19,203
Perhaps happen something.
- As what?

1006
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:21,562
It offers that your wife
don't hear you speak this way.

1007
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:25,081
I would marry you
if was free, but you are not it.

1008
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:28,239
So don't speak of it.
He/she walks, start to work.

1009
01:06:28,327 --> 01:06:29,760
Do I paint your fingernails?

1010
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:34,681
Good,
he/she planned to make it me alone.

1011
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:36,115
However...

1012
01:06:38,087 --> 01:06:39,520
Yes, make it, Chris.

1013
01:06:50,847 --> 01:06:52,838
It will be a work teacher.

1014
01:07:37,647 --> 01:07:39,000
Hello, Adele.

1015
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:41,562
I went to the butcher shop
as you took charge me.

1016
01:07:42,087 --> 01:07:44,123
They have given me
a liver buenísimo.

1017
01:07:48,687 --> 01:07:51,485
From when you know
to Katherine March?

1018
01:07:52,207 --> 01:07:53,606
He/she answers.

1019
01:07:57,767 --> 01:08:00,884
Not I know of what you speak to me.
- From when do you know it?

1020
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:04,407
Not lose the calm,
it lets him to help you with the coat.

1021
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:07,081
You have lost the calm.
It separates that, it drops the knife.

1022
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:09,280
You want to behead me.

1023
01:08:13,247 --> 01:08:14,646
From when do you know it?

1024
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:18,477
Not I know to what you refer.
- Liar.

1025
01:08:19,207 --> 01:08:21,198
You take years copying their work.

1026
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:23,278
Faking that you are the creator
of those squares...

1027
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:25,358
...while you copied
the work of a great artist.

1028
01:08:25,447 --> 01:08:27,722
For sure you go to Dellarowe
to take notes.

1029
01:08:28,527 --> 01:08:30,518
Where?
- You know it very well.

1030
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,677
To the gallery Dellarowe in the 57.

1031
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:35,522
The window is full with
squares of Katherine March.

1032
01:08:36,647 --> 01:08:37,762
Have you become madwoman?

1033
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,317
A single square is worth
500 dollars, they are brilliant.

1034
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:43,724
Now I understand
why he/she sometimes thought...

1035
01:08:43,807 --> 01:08:46,480
...that there was something in your work,
I already know why.

1036
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:49,639
If I see you again
painting here...

1037
01:08:49,727 --> 01:08:51,206
...I swear you that I will call
to that woman...

1038
01:08:51,287 --> 01:08:53,847
...and I will tell him/her that you are
plagiarizing their ideas.

1039
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:55,716
Humbug.

1040
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:59,476
Hogarth should go carefully,
you are able to steal him/her.

1041
01:09:07,767 --> 01:09:09,120
That not, affection.

1042
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:11,643
Dellarowe wants
that you give them to him all.

1043
01:09:11,887 --> 01:09:13,559
Chris finished it just yesterday.

1044
01:09:14,167 --> 01:09:16,283
Janeway says
that the last squares...

1045
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:18,361
...they are the best.

1046
01:09:21,647 --> 01:09:23,922
I was right about Janeway,
lazy.

1047
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:25,645
Yes, but it puts me nervous.

1048
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:28,042
This week I have left
three times to have dinner with him...

1049
01:09:28,127 --> 01:09:29,879
...and he/she already speaks of having breakfast.

1050
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:32,798
He/she looks at me in a strange way.

1051
01:09:32,887 --> 01:09:34,878
You limit yourself to have him/her I please.

1052
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:37,117
For you it is very easy to say it...

1053
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:39,198
...but,
what do you tell me of my nerves?

1054
01:09:39,367 --> 01:09:41,278
Dad will take charge
of Kitty.

1055
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:44,880
It is possible that he/she gives him/her
a ring of brilliant...

1056
01:09:45,687 --> 01:09:46,915
...a limousine...

1057
01:09:47,727 --> 01:09:50,287
...and a house with garden.
- And to Johnny?

1058
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,805
ÉI goes with the lot.

1059
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,276
Chris.

1060
01:10:08,527 --> 01:10:10,916
As my squares they have arrived
to Dellarowe?

1061
01:10:15,607 --> 01:10:16,357
Chris!

1062
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:19,478
Don't get angry with me.

1063
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:23,121
Not I am mad,
I don't understand anything.

1064
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:25,040
Not it is possible.

1065
01:10:25,207 --> 01:10:27,163
Forgive me, treasure. Me...

1066
01:10:27,287 --> 01:10:30,245
He/she needed money.
He/she had to pay the furniture.

1067
01:10:30,807 --> 01:10:32,206
It was so humiliating.

1068
01:10:32,287 --> 01:10:35,404
Not he/she could tell it to you,
you have been so generous with me.

1069
01:10:36,207 --> 01:10:39,916
Not he/she could.
For that reason I sold the squares.

1070
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:42,120
To Dellarowe?

1071
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:45,919
Seriously you did sell them to him?

1072
01:10:46,007 --> 01:10:47,042
Yes.

1073
01:10:47,727 --> 01:10:50,719
I already know that I should not sign them
with my name...

1074
01:10:51,407 --> 01:10:54,444
...but Dellarowe demanded to know
who had painted them...

1075
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:56,597
...and he/she could not give him/her your name.

1076
01:10:57,727 --> 01:11:00,241
He/she no longer has remedy,
truth?

1077
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:01,476
No.

1078
01:11:02,207 --> 01:11:06,280
The curious thing is that
he/she didn't seem to give him/her importance.

1079
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:09,601
Yes, the certain thing is that yes he/she has it,
Kitty.

1080
01:11:10,607 --> 01:11:12,677
If the has taken me
to somebody as Dellarowe...

1081
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:13,995
...he/she would not have caught them.

1082
01:11:14,807 --> 01:11:16,081
I am a failure.

1083
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:18,837
No, you are a great painter.

1084
01:11:20,007 --> 01:11:23,363
Mr. Dellarowe said it
and also Mr. Janeway.

1085
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:25,356
Good...

1086
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:30,445
...they said that I was it.
- Because they will continue saying it.

1087
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:33,157
Chris!
- No, Kitty.

1088
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,007
Please, don't cry more.

1089
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:37,202
I am happy,
it is as a dream.

1090
01:11:37,407 --> 01:11:40,319
Chris, you are so good,
so generous.

1091
01:11:40,487 --> 01:11:42,478
Not it cares what name
take the squares...

1092
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,239
...yours or mine.

1093
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:46,398
It is as
if is married.

1094
01:11:47,487 --> 01:11:49,079
Only I take your name.

1095
01:11:49,887 --> 01:11:53,084
Go, that makes that
sit down in debt.

1096
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:57,201
I want to paint your portrait,
what do you say?

1097
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:03,202
It ascends there.

1098
01:12:25,047 --> 01:12:28,005
Do you know how I will call it?
Self-portrait.

1099
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:35,115
EXHIBITION
DE KATHERINE MARCH

1100
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:11,875
Hello, Damon.
- Hello.

1101
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:13,596
Williams.

1102
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:16,725
I admit that it is the first time
that I agree with you.

1103
01:13:16,807 --> 01:13:17,796
Thank you.

1104
01:13:17,967 --> 01:13:21,357
I believe that the painter is still
more fascinating than their squares.

1105
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:22,716
How is it?

1106
01:13:23,847 --> 01:13:26,407
As Gioconda
without the smile, hidden something.

1107
01:13:27,327 --> 01:13:29,682
It seems sometimes
two different people.

1108
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,642
I speak of that in my article,
do you want to read it?

1109
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:55,637
Mr. Cross, out is somebody
that he/she wants to see him/her.

1110
01:13:56,447 --> 01:13:58,085
Who is?
- Not he/she mentioned their name.

1111
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,919
He/she only said that he/she was a detective.

1112
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:29,764
Are you the detective?
- I was it once, Mister Cross.

1113
01:14:31,207 --> 01:14:32,879
Is it that it doesn't recognize me?

1114
01:14:34,127 --> 01:14:34,877
No.

1115
01:14:39,247 --> 01:14:40,316
Homer.

1116
01:14:40,807 --> 01:14:41,956
Surprised, hey?

1117
01:14:42,407 --> 01:14:43,920
Don't faint,
Mister Cross.

1118
01:14:44,007 --> 01:14:46,362
Calm, let him to explain to him/her.

1119
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:48,997
For then
it was put in a mess.

1120
01:14:49,807 --> 01:14:52,605
It took out them money to the bars
secret of the port.

1121
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,239
They gave the blow.

1122
01:14:56,087 --> 01:14:58,442
And the poli will make
an investigation.

1123
01:14:58,847 --> 01:15:00,246
One night was
in the bridge of Brooklyn...

1124
01:15:00,327 --> 01:15:02,318
...giving turns to the matter...

1125
01:15:02,407 --> 01:15:04,125
...when he/she appeared
a type screaming:

1126
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:06,198
"A woman
it has jumped of the bridge."

1127
01:15:06,527 --> 01:15:09,519
I left running, I took off
the jacket and I threw myself to the water.

1128
01:15:09,847 --> 01:15:12,361
It felt so bad
that he/she wanted not to leave.

1129
01:15:13,887 --> 01:15:14,922
Does he care it?

1130
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:25,039
Good, I began to swim
in full night...

1131
01:15:25,127 --> 01:15:28,164
...I caught it of the arm,
to the while it was tired...

1132
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:30,642
...I heard the whistle of a tug
near me...

1133
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:33,321
...I was tossed above
a barge...

1134
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,318
...I held myself to the overboard
and I allowed myself to take.

1135
01:15:35,887 --> 01:15:38,606
I looked my hand,
and what was there in her?

1136
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:41,399
The woman's handbag.

1137
01:15:41,487 --> 01:15:44,365
He/she had caught their handbag
instead of their arm.

1138
01:15:44,727 --> 01:15:48,766
Inside of there was 2.700 dollars
in notes.

1139
01:15:49,367 --> 01:15:52,086
He/she imagines to somebody that
do take off the life with that money?

1140
01:15:53,607 --> 01:15:55,757
And the barge discharged
in a ship barn...

1141
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:59,317
...going to Honduras,
and I left with him.

1142
01:16:00,447 --> 01:16:02,438
Then, if it is not dead...

1143
01:16:03,527 --> 01:16:06,166
...I am not married with Adele,
certain is not?

1144
01:16:10,927 --> 01:16:12,918
How much you would pay me for...

1145
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:15,518
...to maintain the closed mouth...

1146
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:17,840
...and to disappear?

1147
01:16:18,527 --> 01:16:19,642
A moment.

1148
01:16:19,727 --> 01:16:21,479
Legally you
he/she is the husband of Adele.

1149
01:16:23,047 --> 01:16:26,562
Without a doubt, you need Adele
and I need money.

1150
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:29,721
Are you a cashier, not?

1151
01:16:29,807 --> 01:16:32,241
He will find easy
to be made with a couple of thousands.

1152
01:16:33,807 --> 01:16:36,526
No, not,
I could not make something like that.

1153
01:16:39,687 --> 01:16:41,678
Not he/she does plan to return with her?
- No.

1154
01:16:42,207 --> 01:16:44,482
Although
not to favor you.

1155
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,678
I will leave for the good of Adele.

1156
01:16:49,527 --> 01:16:51,961
Not you believe
that this finishes here.

1157
01:16:52,527 --> 01:16:54,836
It is possible
that some day it returns.

1158
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:58,644
Adele would leave him/her at once
for a man as me.

1159
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,039
I will get him/her the money.

1160
01:17:04,647 --> 01:17:06,319
That is more reasonable.

1161
01:17:06,607 --> 01:17:08,120
Although he/she will have
that to wait for me here.

1162
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:10,516
I won't have it until later
of closing at six o'clock.

1163
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:11,684
I Will Wait, Cross.

1164
01:17:14,967 --> 01:17:17,197
Hello, Johnny. Hello, Kitty.
- Hello, Mike.

1165
01:17:17,287 --> 01:17:18,356
Hello.

1166
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:22,244
Not do forget the champagne, hey?

1167
01:17:22,807 --> 01:17:25,082
Beautiful car, Johnny.
Does he/she run a lot, not?

1168
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:27,518
Any poli
it could reach me.

1169
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:30,562
He/she hears, they are enough 25 cents
for a cube of ice?

1170
01:17:30,807 --> 01:17:32,035
Clear, Johnny.

1171
01:17:37,847 --> 01:17:39,280
Do you lend me the punch?

1172
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:41,917
Not forget to return it.
- Clear, clear.

1173
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:45,762
Thank you.

1174
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:50,766
Only 200.

1175
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:53,518
It is all that I could get.

1176
01:17:53,887 --> 01:17:56,481
Not he/she believes that their wife
is something worth more?

1177
01:17:58,087 --> 01:18:01,397
He/she will see, I want him to get that that
it corresponds him/her, Mister Higgins.

1178
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:04,125
What he/she tells me
of the money of the insurance?

1179
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:05,196
The insurance?

1180
01:18:05,287 --> 01:18:07,801
Two thousand in the event of death,
of their death.

1181
01:18:08,087 --> 01:18:10,157
Adele has charged them,
are his, not?

1182
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:13,525
The guard in their room.

1183
01:18:13,767 --> 01:18:16,565
Not it is well that me the cripple,
Mister Higgins, but...

1184
01:18:17,247 --> 01:18:19,966
...if you take them to him,
it will be very fair.

1185
01:18:20,847 --> 01:18:23,759
And how, of what way?
- It is very easy.

1186
01:18:25,127 --> 01:18:27,687
Tonight
she plans go to watch a movie.

1187
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:31,558
I allow him/her to enter,
you catch the funds...

1188
01:18:32,727 --> 01:18:34,160
...and it is released.

1189
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:37,725
Why don't you catch them?

1190
01:18:37,807 --> 01:18:40,116
Good, it is necessary that
let us stay to the margin.

1191
01:18:41,127 --> 01:18:42,640
He/she already knows Adele.

1192
01:18:47,007 --> 01:18:48,599
And if he/she doesn't go to the cinema...

1193
01:18:49,607 --> 01:18:52,599
...and I show up,
will he/she discover me, not?

1194
01:18:54,127 --> 01:18:55,845
Yes, only...

1195
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:59,042
...that won't happen.
- Why?

1196
01:18:59,967 --> 01:19:04,006
He/she will see, you will wait
in front of the house at eleven o'clock.

1197
01:19:51,647 --> 01:19:52,716
All well?

1198
01:19:53,127 --> 01:19:55,641
Why I should remain silent,
and this darkness?

1199
01:19:55,887 --> 01:19:58,765
Mrs. Michaels. He/she remembers
to Mrs. Michaels, not?

1200
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:01,285
Yes.
- And the other neighbors.

1201
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:10,686
Where are the funds?

1202
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:13,406
There, in the last drawer
of the dresser.

1203
01:20:16,047 --> 01:20:18,038
Well, give me the lantern.

1204
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:31,124
Thieves!

1205
01:20:31,207 --> 01:20:32,481
Police!

1206
01:20:33,047 --> 01:20:34,639
Who are you?

1207
01:20:34,807 --> 01:20:36,559
No, it cannot be.

1208
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:04,396
Johnny!

1209
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:07,643
Oh, Johnny!
- Hello, lazy.

1210
01:21:07,727 --> 01:21:09,240
I adore you, Johnny.

1211
01:21:14,447 --> 01:21:15,675
What has that been?

1212
01:21:25,007 --> 01:21:26,360
Is Chris?

1213
01:21:34,847 --> 01:21:36,838
Johnny, era Chris?
- You call it.

1214
01:21:39,007 --> 01:21:40,122
Chris.

1215
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:42,036
Chris.

1216
01:21:42,247 --> 01:21:43,726
He/she should shake.

1217
01:21:43,807 --> 01:21:46,924
How he/she went that is that he/she would come
tonight? I don't understand it.

1218
01:21:47,007 --> 01:21:49,282
You never understand anything.
- Why do you get angry?

1219
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:52,086
It serves me to think as what
being with an idiot as you?

1220
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:54,635
I told you that is careful.
- Clear, throw the blame.

1221
01:21:54,727 --> 01:21:56,797
You asked me that stays
and I wanted to leave.

1222
01:21:57,127 --> 01:21:59,322
Johnny,
why do you speak this way to me?

1223
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,119
It is the true, I am fed up with you.

1224
01:22:01,487 --> 01:22:02,556
Johnny.

1225
01:22:02,647 --> 01:22:04,956
It is the only language that
you understand, we have finished.

1226
01:22:18,127 --> 01:22:19,560
<I adore you, Johnny. >

1227
01:22:28,287 --> 01:22:30,005
<I adore you, Johnny. >

1228
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:37,319
Mr.,
sympathize with of the sinners.

1229
01:22:37,647 --> 01:22:40,480
The on the way to the wrong
it is easy to continue.

1230
01:22:40,687 --> 01:22:43,884
However, that road
it ends up in the hell.

1231
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:48,236
Mr., sympathize with of me,
sinful poor person.

1232
01:22:48,647 --> 01:22:51,639
Sympathize with of us,
Mr..

1233
01:22:55,447 --> 01:22:58,120
Millie, am I Kitty, and Johnny?

1234
01:22:59,367 --> 01:23:01,835
I supposed that he/she would go to Tiny,
was he/she drinking?

1235
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:04,600
Anything, a fight.

1236
01:23:04,767 --> 01:23:06,325
This cannot live without me.

1237
01:23:06,407 --> 01:23:08,523
The same as I cannot live
without him.

1238
01:23:08,607 --> 01:23:11,440
Did he/she say if he/she would come here?
To give me a beating?

1239
01:23:11,847 --> 01:23:15,123
Go, how he likes to show off
of hard man.

1240
01:23:15,807 --> 01:23:18,275
Not you should worry,
he/she only speaks to speak.

1241
01:23:18,927 --> 01:23:21,157
If is in love
you would understand it.

1242
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,442
He/she remains silent,
Johnny is inoffensive.

1243
01:23:26,807 --> 01:23:28,718
It is this way the love, treasure.

1244
01:23:30,447 --> 01:23:33,405
He/she has just entered
and mo?a that takes go.

1245
01:23:33,647 --> 01:23:34,921
Good-bye, lover.

1246
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:36,395
Hello, Johnny.

1247
01:23:39,727 --> 01:23:41,524
We go, Johnny, I have heard you.

1248
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:55,919
You lied me, Kitty.

1249
01:23:57,247 --> 01:23:58,475
Was he, truth?

1250
01:23:58,567 --> 01:24:00,603
I have me the blame
of being in love?

1251
01:24:01,887 --> 01:24:03,764
No, you only believe he to be.

1252
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:06,955
Not you can want somebody
as that Johnny.

1253
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:09,600
It is bad.

1254
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:12,164
Does he/she have you dominated, not?

1255
01:24:15,047 --> 01:24:17,003
He/she wanted to kill him/her.

1256
01:24:17,207 --> 01:24:18,686
And that is horrible.

1257
01:24:18,807 --> 01:24:20,286
To what have you come here?

1258
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:24,437
To request you that we marry.
- And your wife?

1259
01:24:24,527 --> 01:24:26,483
I no longer have it, that ended up.
- For heaven's sake...

1260
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:28,285
Their husband has returned,
I am free.

1261
01:24:31,247 --> 01:24:33,920
We go, don't cry, Kitty.

1262
01:24:34,287 --> 01:24:36,847
I know what you feel, but forget it.

1263
01:24:38,087 --> 01:24:41,363
We all make errors,
it doesn't care what happened.

1264
01:24:42,567 --> 01:24:44,159
I can already marry you.

1265
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:45,846
I want you to be my wife.

1266
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:48,727
We will leave both together
very far from here.

1267
01:24:49,287 --> 01:24:51,278
Where can forget
to that man.

1268
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:54,761
Not cry, Kitty.
Please, don't cry.

1269
01:24:55,847 --> 01:24:58,122
Not I am crying, imbecile,
I laugh.

1270
01:24:58,767 --> 01:25:00,041
Kitty...

1271
01:25:00,927 --> 01:25:04,078
You are an unhappy one,
how can you be so silly?

1272
01:25:04,207 --> 01:25:05,356
Kitty...

1273
01:25:09,327 --> 01:25:11,761
I have wanted to laugh in your face
since I met you.

1274
01:25:11,847 --> 01:25:13,326
You are ugly and old.

1275
01:25:13,407 --> 01:25:16,444
And I am fed up with you.
Full, full, full!

1276
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:17,676
Kitty, I beg it to you.

1277
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:20,800
You to kill Johnny?
I would like that attempts it.

1278
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:23,799
All the bones would break you,
him yes he/she is a man.

1279
01:25:23,887 --> 01:25:25,605
Do you seek me, you?

1280
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,439
Outside of here, it was!

1281
01:25:27,847 --> 01:25:30,122
What will you make?
Chris! Chris!

1282
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:31,560
Don't come closer, Chris.

1283
01:25:31,647 --> 01:25:32,921
Chris!

1284
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:48,476
Hey, what do you make?

1285
01:25:48,767 --> 01:25:51,361
Be careful, Johnny,
you will kill somebody.

1286
01:27:02,007 --> 01:27:04,805
<The crime of the punch>
<in Greenwich Village. >

1287
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:06,684
<Murdered famous painter. >

1288
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:34,877
Chris, ascend.

1289
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:01,160
A moment, please.

1290
01:28:04,287 --> 01:28:06,039
Why did he/she make it, Chris?

1291
01:28:06,567 --> 01:28:08,876
When he/she called me the police
he/she could not believe it.

1292
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:11,606
They denounced him/her for telephone.
- Yes, a certain Higgins.

1293
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:14,037
I consulted the books
before calling him/her.

1294
01:28:15,047 --> 01:28:16,719
Does he/she know how much it lacks?

1295
01:28:18,087 --> 01:28:20,885
More than 1.200.
- We will take it to us.

1296
01:28:20,967 --> 01:28:22,161
While it presents the accusation,
Sr. Hogarth.

1297
01:28:22,247 --> 01:28:23,805
Wait, Morris.

1298
01:28:24,927 --> 01:28:26,918
Not I can make it.
- But Mister Hogarth...

1299
01:28:27,007 --> 01:28:29,521
You have completed
with their duty and I thank him/her for it.

1300
01:28:30,487 --> 01:28:33,081
There there is a box of cigarettes,
take you her.

1301
01:28:33,167 --> 01:28:35,635
This well, Mister Hogarth,
what you say.

1302
01:28:44,247 --> 01:28:46,442
Was Chris, for a woman, not?

1303
01:28:47,967 --> 01:28:49,320
I imagined it.

1304
01:28:50,727 --> 01:28:52,604
Not I want that
go to the jail, Chris...

1305
01:28:53,047 --> 01:28:55,561
...but it cannot continue
working here.

1306
01:29:16,247 --> 01:29:18,556
I have not made anything,
I want...

1307
01:29:19,447 --> 01:29:20,641
I want a lawyer.

1308
01:29:22,007 --> 01:29:24,396
Where did they stop it?
- In Rivers Sandline.

1309
01:29:24,487 --> 01:29:25,966
He/she tried to escape
in the girl's car.

1310
01:29:26,047 --> 01:29:27,719
That car is mine.

1311
01:29:30,567 --> 01:29:32,444
This is also yours.

1312
01:29:32,527 --> 01:29:35,485
It takes your initials,
the blood belongs to the girl.

1313
01:29:36,887 --> 01:29:39,720
Here there are 140 dollars
that you removed him/her of the handbag.

1314
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,206
They are mine.

1315
01:29:42,767 --> 01:29:46,476
This ring belonged to her,
it will be worth about 600 dollars.

1316
01:29:48,727 --> 01:29:50,683
Small expert is made.

1317
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:52,884
I found difficult it 1.200.

1318
01:29:53,967 --> 01:29:56,083
Here they are
the rest of the jewels.

1319
01:29:57,007 --> 01:29:59,805
Not they are worth a lot,
but it took them to him all.

1320
01:29:59,887 --> 01:30:02,355
And why not?
She will no longer need them.

1321
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:09,396
I want a lawyer.

1322
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,318
I am a citizen,
I am entitled my.

1323
01:30:14,047 --> 01:30:16,083
This also belongs you,
no?

1324
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:17,998
He/she has your prints dactilares.

1325
01:30:18,247 --> 01:30:19,965
Clear, I picked up it of the floor.

1326
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:21,446
How he/she went that is
that it was dead?

1327
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:23,040
He/she thought that it was only sleeping.

1328
01:30:26,967 --> 01:30:29,242
She didn't paint
all those squares.

1329
01:30:29,327 --> 01:30:32,842
Old Cross is not so silly
as it seems, he/she painted them the one.

1330
01:30:33,367 --> 01:30:35,483
Yes, the accused
he/she brought me two squares.

1331
01:30:35,567 --> 01:30:38,035
He/she told me that he/she had painted them
Ms. March.

1332
01:30:38,527 --> 01:30:41,439
I consider myself an expert
and there is not the smallest doubt...

1333
01:30:41,927 --> 01:30:43,724
...Kitty was an excellent one
painter.

1334
01:30:44,047 --> 01:30:45,275
When he/she rented the study...

1335
01:30:45,367 --> 01:30:48,200
...she told me that it was
an artist, he accompanied her.

1336
01:30:48,287 --> 01:30:50,164
I didn't like it then
and I don't like it now.

1337
01:30:50,727 --> 01:30:52,797
Yes, when he/she drank it was I force.

1338
01:30:52,967 --> 01:30:56,004
At two o'clock, when he/she left the bar,
he/she said that he/she would give him/her a beating.

1339
01:30:56,487 --> 01:30:57,602
Then I told him/her:

1340
01:30:57,687 --> 01:30:59,598
"Care, John,
you will kill somebody."

1341
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:01,479
And it killed her with my punch.

1342
01:31:01,887 --> 01:31:04,355
Then I heard him/her say:
"Hello, John", and it hung.

1343
01:31:04,727 --> 01:31:06,365
It was there, yes.

1344
01:31:06,767 --> 01:31:08,883
What I don't understand
it is that he/she says that he/she painted.

1345
01:31:09,287 --> 01:31:10,276
I never saw it paint.

1346
01:31:10,807 --> 01:31:12,559
That was characteristic.

1347
01:31:12,887 --> 01:31:14,718
Not he/she left
that the sees paint.

1348
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:17,158
I have compared their letter
with the signature.

1349
01:31:17,527 --> 01:31:18,642
Not there is any doubt.

1350
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:21,397
That if Cross paints?

1351
01:31:21,927 --> 01:31:24,441
He/she only knew how to copy,
he/she is a humbug.

1352
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,997
He/she stole me to my and their boss
and to Katherine March.

1353
01:31:28,767 --> 01:31:32,077
My wife, that is to say,
my former wife is right.

1354
01:31:33,527 --> 01:31:34,960
I don't know how to paint.

1355
01:31:36,567 --> 01:31:39,286
My copies were so bad
that I had to destroy them.

1356
01:31:39,367 --> 01:31:41,244
Not they do realize?
Lie!

1357
01:31:41,447 --> 01:31:43,677
<The murderer of the punch will die>
<in the electric seat... >

1358
01:31:43,767 --> 01:31:45,439
<... tonight in Sing Sing. >

1359
01:31:50,127 --> 01:31:51,958
I will pluck him/her.

1360
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,237
Hello, Mister Cross.
- Hello.

1361
01:31:55,847 --> 01:31:57,678
Tom Crucker
of Living Road.

1362
01:31:58,327 --> 01:31:59,840
Yes, Tom Crucker.

1363
01:32:00,167 --> 01:32:02,556
John Williams of Morning Road
and Cohan of Hear.

1364
01:32:02,647 --> 01:32:03,841
Hello.

1365
01:32:04,847 --> 01:32:06,280
A cigarette?
- No, thank you.

1366
01:32:07,007 --> 01:32:08,156
Van to attend?

1367
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:10,796
Yes, I don't like it
to witness executions...

1368
01:32:10,887 --> 01:32:12,878
...but I don't care this
that it is made.

1369
01:32:12,967 --> 01:32:14,446
He/she made him/her Easter
to Johnny Prince...

1370
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:16,597
...when he/she said
that he/she didn't know how to paint.

1371
01:32:17,047 --> 01:32:18,605
Nobody made him/her Easter
to Johnny...

1372
01:32:18,687 --> 01:32:20,757
...except him
to speak too much.

1373
01:32:20,847 --> 01:32:24,044
Yes, when it began to insult
to the girl it signed their sentence.

1374
01:32:24,127 --> 01:32:25,606
I noticed the jury.

1375
01:32:25,687 --> 01:32:28,201
If has been quiet
it would have been life imprisonment.

1376
01:32:28,727 --> 01:32:30,240
The tests were only
incidental.

1377
01:32:30,327 --> 01:32:33,205
To what does he/she refer?
Was a fair trial, not?

1378
01:32:33,287 --> 01:32:35,039
Yes, but always
there is a doubt.

1379
01:32:35,407 --> 01:32:37,921
I suppose that you will say
that justice has not been made.

1380
01:32:38,367 --> 01:32:40,642
That the true murderer
it is safe.

1381
01:32:40,887 --> 01:32:42,718
Me not, that is impossible.

1382
01:32:43,007 --> 01:32:44,918
Mr. Cross, any crime
it is unpunished.

1383
01:32:46,047 --> 01:32:48,641
How does he/she say?
- No, don't throw him/her of the language.

1384
01:32:48,967 --> 01:32:52,039
Not he/she will stop of speaking,
it is their favorite topic.

1385
01:32:53,127 --> 01:32:55,083
It is well, you can laugh,
boys.

1386
01:32:55,167 --> 01:32:56,805
Anything is unpunished.

1387
01:32:57,087 --> 01:32:59,840
Imagine that we have
a tribunal right here...

1388
01:33:00,127 --> 01:33:02,118
...judge, jury and executioner.

1389
01:33:03,807 --> 01:33:05,126
I don't understand him/her.

1390
01:33:05,287 --> 01:33:07,847
The murder doesn't solve anything,
what do you say?

1391
01:33:07,927 --> 01:33:08,996
You have seen many trials.

1392
01:33:09,087 --> 01:33:10,998
In that I should admit
that you are right.

1393
01:33:11,367 --> 01:33:13,961
The problem is right here
and it cannot leave.

1394
01:33:14,327 --> 01:33:16,795
Is it here, only here, and what?

1395
01:33:17,047 --> 01:33:18,958
That you continue punishing you
unceasingly.

1396
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:21,635
Not you can escape from it,
never.

1397
01:33:22,247 --> 01:33:24,078
That doesn't make sense.

1398
01:33:24,167 --> 01:33:26,727
You have not seen so many trials
as me, Mister Cross.

1399
01:33:27,047 --> 01:33:30,039
I prefer the judge to dictate my
it sentences before to make it me.

1400
01:33:35,847 --> 01:33:36,962
At what time is the execution?

1401
01:33:40,327 --> 01:33:41,646
At eleven o'clock.

1402
01:34:16,487 --> 01:34:19,126
I didn't make it,
I swear him/her that I didn't make it.

1403
01:34:19,207 --> 01:34:20,925
Why don't they want to believe me?

1404
01:34:21,007 --> 01:34:23,157
I have told the truth,
I didn't kill her.

1405
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:26,762
I swear them that I didn't kill her,
I wanted it, I wanted it...

1406
01:35:29,127 --> 01:35:30,242
<Johnny! >

1407
01:35:30,607 --> 01:35:32,325
<Johnny! >

1408
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:35,158
<Oh, Johnny! Johnny! >

1409
01:35:36,407 --> 01:35:37,522
<Lazy. >

1410
01:35:37,727 --> 01:35:40,321
<Up, lazy, espabila. >

1411
01:35:40,487 --> 01:35:42,682
<Johnny, treasure, don't leave me. >

1412
01:35:43,007 --> 01:35:46,522
<Clear, my life, >
<dad will take care of you. >

1413
01:35:46,647 --> 01:35:48,399
<I adore you, Johnny. >

1414
01:35:48,527 --> 01:35:49,755
<Johnny. >

1415
01:35:50,367 --> 01:35:52,244
<Johnny, comes. >

1416
01:35:52,327 --> 01:35:55,160
<Lazy, lazy, >
<are you there? >

1417
01:35:55,247 --> 01:35:58,159
<I adore you, Johnny. >
<I adore you, Johnny. >

1418
01:36:21,047 --> 01:36:24,437
<Johnny, now we are together. >

1419
01:36:27,007 --> 01:36:28,838
<It also killed me, >
<Kitty. >

1420
01:36:29,327 --> 01:36:32,000
<ÉI has united, Johnny... >

1421
01:36:32,087 --> 01:36:33,725
<... forever. >

1422
01:36:34,567 --> 01:36:35,841
Kitty...

1423
01:36:35,927 --> 01:36:38,680
<Imbecile, >
<how can you be so silly? >

1424
01:36:39,047 --> 01:36:40,480
No, Kitty, not.

1425
01:36:40,887 --> 01:36:42,878
<And do you seek me, you? >

1426
01:36:43,207 --> 01:36:46,165
<She is mine, Chris, >
<forever, forever. >

1427
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:47,566
Coarse!

1428
01:36:48,927 --> 01:36:52,363
<You killed me, Chris, >
<you are old and ugly. >

1429
01:36:52,447 --> 01:36:55,405
<You killed me, >
<you killed me, you killed me. >

1430
01:36:55,487 --> 01:36:56,840
No, Kitty, was him.

1431
01:36:57,727 --> 01:37:01,163
You were innocent, you were pure,
he killed that.

1432
01:37:01,287 --> 01:37:03,198
<No, him not. Johnny not. >

1433
01:37:03,367 --> 01:37:06,165
<Do you see it, Chris? >
<She wants me. >

1434
01:37:06,447 --> 01:37:10,201
For that reason you should die,
I have killed you.

1435
01:37:10,927 --> 01:37:12,565
<She is mine, Chris. >

1436
01:37:13,887 --> 01:37:15,843
<You to kill Johnny? >

1437
01:37:15,927 --> 01:37:17,883
<I would like that attempts it. >

1438
01:37:17,967 --> 01:37:20,197
<All the bones would break you. >

1439
01:37:20,287 --> 01:37:21,515
I beg it to you.

1440
01:37:35,047 --> 01:37:37,402
<Johnny. Johnny. >

1441
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:41,155
<Oh, Johnny! Johnny! >

1442
01:37:44,847 --> 01:37:46,917
<I adore you, Johnny. >

1443
01:37:53,647 --> 01:37:55,080
There this passing something.

1444
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:22,678
He/she calms down, friend, calms down.

1445
01:38:24,087 --> 01:38:25,839
<Johnny. >

1446
01:38:26,127 --> 01:38:27,799
<Johnny. >

1447
01:38:28,367 --> 01:38:30,005
<I adore you, Johnny. >

1448
01:38:30,527 --> 01:38:31,880
<I adore you. >

1449
01:38:53,207 --> 01:38:54,959
Up, we go, up.

1450
01:38:57,527 --> 01:38:59,040
Ah, you are you.

1451
01:38:59,527 --> 01:39:01,279
I have not told you
that you don't sleep here?

1452
01:39:01,447 --> 01:39:02,926
You already know the norms.

1453
01:39:12,087 --> 01:39:13,759
Veto to the hospice, he/she walks.

1454
01:39:16,127 --> 01:39:17,526
We go, we go.

1455
01:39:28,967 --> 01:39:30,400
Who is that old one?

1456
01:39:30,767 --> 01:39:32,485
He/she has the mania
that it killed two people...

1457
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:35,035
...five or six years ago.
It is a fixed idea.

1458
01:39:35,367 --> 01:39:37,323
It is always
trying to surrender.

1459
01:39:39,367 --> 01:39:42,916
He/she wants them to judge it and him
execute, he/she is a crazy poor person.

1460
01:40:28,447 --> 01:40:29,721
That is their work teacher.

1461
01:40:36,967 --> 01:40:38,559
It hurts me to lose it.

1462
01:40:38,927 --> 01:40:42,203
For 10.000 dollars
it should not care him/her so much.

1463
01:40:58,167 --> 01:40:59,566
<Johnny. >

1464
01:41:02,087 --> 01:41:03,725
<Johnny. >

1465
01:41:06,007 --> 01:41:08,077
<AI end is drained. >

1466
01:41:11,087 --> 01:41:13,123
<I adore you, Johnny. >
