<i>This film is a fiction

2
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:31,092
<i>A Monkey Town production</i>

3
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:39,059
<i>BASHING</i>

4
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:43,897
<i>Upon returning home from Iraq,</i>

5
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:47,108
<i>those taken hostage were
shunned by society.</i>

6
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,595
Hello.

7
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:45,513
Hello, reception.

8
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:48,725
Yes, sir.

9
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:36,731
Miss Takai...

10
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:39,192
If you please...

11
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:01,631
What is it?
I haven't finished.

12
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,591
You are dismissed.

13
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,094
Here's what I owe you.

14
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:14,519
Since you arrived,
the atmosphere has changed.

15
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:16,479
One of your colleagues

16
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:19,941
has the internet and
he likes to surf the web.

17
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,696
He says there are
all kinds of insults about you.

18
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:28,533
He's shouting it from the rooftops.

19
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:33,079
Your pay up until today,
there's no need to stay.

20
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:34,622
It's inconvenient.

21
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:37,875
It's inconvenient for me.

22
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:40,712
I need the money.

23
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:45,925
Not to go back over there at least?

24
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:52,432
Let me give you some advice.

25
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,184
Don't ever go back there.

26
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:58,688
If you were kidnapped again,

27
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:01,232
you'd be in real trouble.

28
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:55,203
- Welcome.
- I'd like some soup.

29
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,750
One tapioca, one tofu, one fritter.

30
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,673
Each one separate.

31
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:09,133
Separate?

32
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,135
One per bowl please.

33
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,933
With lots of sauce.

34
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,644
More.

35
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,271
More.

36
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:26,192
More.

37
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:28,778
As much as is in the others.

38
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:19,495
What the hell?

39
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,638
What happened?

40
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,000
Yuko...

41
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,592
What happened?

42
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:41,929
Yuko...

43
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,726
I got fired.

44
00:11:49,646 --> 00:11:53,774
And some stupid idiots ruined dinner.

45
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,404
What's wrong with everyone?

46
00:11:59,948 --> 00:12:03,075
Is what I did so wrong?

47
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:09,707
Good grief!

48
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,335
Say something!

49
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:33,397
Yuko isn't here?
She isn't eating?

50
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:37,693
Did something happen?

51
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:41,238
She got fired from her job.

52
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,157
Why?

53
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,743
No idea.

54
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,163
Hey, Yuko!

55
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,844
<i>We're not here right now.</i>

56
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,015
<i>Please leave your name
and message after the tone.</i>

57
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:11,060
<i>Hello?</i>

58
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:18,401
<i>You little idiot. You just do
what you like Takai Yuko.</i>

59
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,530
<i>Now listen up.
I'll have your hide, you bitch.</i>

60
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:24,907
<i>Hello?!</i>

61
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:41,048
I've had enough!

62
00:13:59,276 --> 00:14:00,651
Where are you going?

63
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:03,946
To buy some soup.

64
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,124
Yuko!

65
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,561
Welcome.

66
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:23,776
I'd like some soup.

67
00:15:28,073 --> 00:15:29,323
Okay...

68
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:34,119
I want two tapioca,

69
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:38,249
two tofu and two fritters.

70
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:42,044
In separate bowls.

71
00:15:42,254 --> 00:15:44,046
With lots of sauce.

72
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,332
Yuko...

73
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,086
Tell me, why were you fired?

74
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:16,055
You know why!

75
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:20,142
You don't have to ask!

76
00:20:33,503 --> 00:20:34,753
Mr. Takai!

77
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,966
Come and see me during your break.

78
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:42,052
I want to speak to you.

79
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,412
Thank you.

80
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,459
So... are things calming down?

81
00:21:57,629 --> 00:21:59,504
What do you mean?

82
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:04,009
Are there as many
anonymous phone calls?

83
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,514
How many per day?

84
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:12,976
I've never counted them,

85
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:15,938
but about a dozen, I guess.

86
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:19,107
That many, after all this time!

87
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:26,823
Haven't you considered taking action?

88
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:28,909
Action?

89
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:33,497
Changing your phone number
or even moving house...

90
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:39,503
Make your mind up!
Why don't you change your identity?

91
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:58,730
You know that our director,
Mr. Ando, arrived yesterday.

92
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:01,483
He summoned me this morning.

93
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:04,194
To talk to me about you,

94
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:06,446
find out what you were doing.

95
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:09,366
To ask me what you were doing!

96
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:12,160
How should I know?

97
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:15,914
But it's crazy, you know!

98
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:20,460
The company still receives
abusive phone calls and emails.

99
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:23,213
Even Head Office is harassed.

100
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,341
It's true, everyone knows about it.

101
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:32,222
The receptionists can't cope
with this situation.

102
00:23:39,397 --> 00:23:42,065
Tell me what it is you want to say.

103
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:46,653
Do you want me to resign?

104
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:50,866
I wouldn't go that far...

105
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:55,579
But when I see the harm caused
to the company's management,

106
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,832
it's quite beyond me.

107
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,837
If I resigned,

108
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:06,214
where would I find another job?

109
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:09,926
Anywhere.
There's plenty of work around.

110
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:15,474
Think it over.

111
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:23,565
You will get your severance pay in full.

112
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:27,402
But do it without delay.

113
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:30,822
I'm counting on you
to handle the formalities.

114
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,412
Mr. Ueki...

115
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,959
I beg you.

116
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:45,837
I beg you to keep me on.

117
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:49,341
I can't resign.

118
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:52,552
I beg you. Look!

119
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:56,223
Going over there as a volunteer!

120
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,558
You've spoiled her.

121
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:02,521
My daughter...

122
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:05,774
is a victim.
She was taken hostage.

123
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,777
Why must she be persecuted?

124
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,448
I beg you. It's the truth!
I'm begging you.

125
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:10,088
<i>We're not here right now.</i>

126
00:26:10,173 --> 00:26:14,176
<i>Please leave your name
and message after the tone.</i>

127
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:17,846
<i>Hello...?</i>

128
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:20,390
<i>You're there aren't you?</i>

129
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:25,896
<i>Don't act innocent.
Answer me!</i>

130
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:27,772
<i>Hello?</i>

131
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:31,693
<i>Ever thought about the term,
"self-responsibility?"</i>

132
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:34,237
<i>You will know the Lord's vengeance.</i>

133
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:35,906
<i>It's crazy.</i>

134
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:40,660
<i>If you'd been killed,
you'd have become a heroine.</i>

135
00:26:42,163 --> 00:26:44,581
<i>No, certainly not in Japan.</i>

136
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:48,835
<i>Anyway, you came home.
Without any shame!</i>

137
00:26:49,212 --> 00:26:50,962
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

138
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:53,965
<i>It's a very important question.</i>

139
00:26:57,136 --> 00:26:59,429
<i>Couldn't you at least answer me?</i>

140
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:41,823
Mrs. Takai, please.

141
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,659
A family matter.

142
00:28:52,293 --> 00:28:54,586
<i>- It's me.</i>
- What's wrong?

143
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:56,796
I've just...

144
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:00,175
handed in my notice.

145
00:29:04,722 --> 00:29:06,389
What?

146
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:10,643
Mr. Ueki told me

147
00:29:11,312 --> 00:29:14,773
he'd been summoned by the director.

148
00:29:15,274 --> 00:29:16,941
It was over Yuko.

149
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:18,860
They're still bombarded

150
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,447
with abusive phone calls
and emails about her.

151
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:25,075
He was ordered to find a solution.

152
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:28,495
A solution...

153
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:30,330
What solution?

154
00:29:31,123 --> 00:29:35,126
Well, he was told to fire me.

155
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:38,129
The company's image was at stake.

156
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:41,466
He didn't want to keep me
any longer.

157
00:29:48,307 --> 00:29:50,809
I realized I was done for.

158
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:55,438
I knew it would happen one day.

159
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:59,943
So, I wrote my letter of resignation
and gave it to my boss.

160
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:05,156
You've handed in your notice?

161
00:30:06,575 --> 00:30:07,992
Yes, I have.

162
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,871
But why?

163
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,541
You could've talked to the union...

164
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:20,255
The situation would've been unbearable.

165
00:30:21,424 --> 00:30:23,633
Maybe, but...

166
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:27,220
Where are you now?

167
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:31,891
Outside the factory gates.

168
00:30:33,144 --> 00:30:35,603
My head's all messed up.

169
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:38,940
I need to get my head straight,

170
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:41,234
but I wanted to tell you

171
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:43,820
before I did anything else.

172
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:48,658
But what's all the rush?

173
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:54,914
Sorry I decided this on my own.

174
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,251
But you know.

175
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,716
I got down on my knees.

176
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:08,720
I couldn't stand it...

177
00:31:51,764 --> 00:31:54,807
<i>"I love you. I love you all."</i>

178
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:24,337
Yuko?

179
00:32:27,258 --> 00:32:28,841
Hello.

180
00:32:31,178 --> 00:32:32,387
What?

181
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:35,890
You've answered at last.

182
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:37,850
What?

183
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,479
Why this "what?"

184
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:43,690
What?

185
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:49,153
Let's meet up.

186
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,031
So we can talk things over.

187
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:55,201
You've been back for six months

188
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:58,454
and we haven't seen each other once.

189
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:02,625
Let's meet up, OK?

190
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:07,797
One of these days...

191
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:44,500
Is that you, Yuko?

192
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:49,505
I know you're home.

193
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:51,883
Why won't you answer?

194
00:33:57,598 --> 00:33:59,599
I threw away the phone.

195
00:34:01,268 --> 00:34:03,019
What happened?

196
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:05,979
Did you answer the phone?

197
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:07,815
Did someone say something?

198
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:15,615
I wanted to talk to you
about your father.

199
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:18,368
I threw it away!

200
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:07,875
Yuko...?

201
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:15,633
Want to meet up?

202
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:20,138
Where?

203
00:36:05,476 --> 00:36:06,851
It's been a long time...

204
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:10,813
What do you want to tell me?

205
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:15,610
You want us to split up, right?

206
00:36:17,988 --> 00:36:20,448
If so, there's no need to meet up.

207
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:23,659
You've changed.

208
00:36:24,077 --> 00:36:25,703
In what way?

209
00:36:26,497 --> 00:36:28,664
I haven't changed at all.

210
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:31,501
That's exactly what I mean.

211
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:35,087
You're more and more stubborn.

212
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:37,590
You don't listen to people.

213
00:36:38,091 --> 00:36:40,092
It's always been the same...

214
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,679
You think of no one but yourself.

215
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:45,348
Me?

216
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:47,183
Yes.

217
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,227
I only think of myself?

218
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,646
How do you mean?

219
00:36:51,939 --> 00:36:54,065
Didn't you go over there to die?

220
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:56,692
A dangerous country at war...

221
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:58,653
What was the sense in that?

222
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:02,031
All you did was embarrass everybody.

223
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:04,450
Me?

224
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:07,537
I embarrassed people?

225
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:09,497
Who?

226
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:11,874
Everyone.

227
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,502
The whole of Japan.

228
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:17,547
Can't you even see that?

229
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:21,384
So, you disapprove of me too?

230
00:37:24,805 --> 00:37:27,682
Why go to some foreign country,

231
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:31,602
and help the people there?

232
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:35,940
If you have so much time
there's this country,

233
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,860
this town, that you could look after.

234
00:37:38,986 --> 00:37:42,196
I don't think we speak
the same language.

235
00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:46,367
What're you talking about?

236
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,829
That's what I've always hated about you.

237
00:37:50,622 --> 00:37:52,707
Volunteering

238
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:56,043
is OK for people with the
time and money.

239
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,338
It doesn't suit you at all!

240
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,424
Okay...

241
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:03,217
Not at all!

242
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:05,887
I said OK!

243
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,558
I get it.

244
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:14,061
Enough.

245
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:33,909
Evenin'.

246
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:40,041
I got fired.

247
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:44,378
I handed in my notice
as a matter of form.

248
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:46,380
But I got fired alright.

249
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:50,593
It's totally crazy.

250
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:54,305
Two unemployed people in this family!

251
00:40:54,723 --> 00:40:57,433
And both at almost the same time.

252
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:04,607
When I left the factory,
I called your stepmother.

253
00:41:05,108 --> 00:41:08,903
I told her everything,
and afterwards I hung up.

254
00:41:09,738 --> 00:41:12,907
I wondered what I was going to do.

255
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:19,246
To help me think,
I thought of going to a bar.

256
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:21,916
But I came straight home.

257
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,460
The fear of doing without no doubt.

258
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:27,296
Just the idea of being out of work...

259
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:30,508
I didn't have the courage
to go for a drink.

260
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:35,262
Even so,

261
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:40,142
being fired just like that
after 30 years in the same firm...

262
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:43,312
It sure hurts.

263
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:46,315
Is it because of me?

264
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:52,113
You condemn what I did?

265
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:54,240
You're wrong.

266
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:55,950
Am I?

267
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:59,203
Why am I wrong? Tell me.

268
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:05,459
Why are you looking at me like that?

269
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:09,130
Listen...

270
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:14,385
Is it wrong to establish links with people?

271
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:18,931
Is feeling connected to others that bad?

272
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:22,935
- It's a good thing.
- Well then...

273
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:28,357
I told you.
I don't condemn you in any way.

274
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:31,318
Didn't I support you from the start?

275
00:42:32,154 --> 00:42:33,696
Being a volunteer

276
00:42:33,905 --> 00:42:37,449
is a hard choice to understand.

277
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:41,370
After what happened, it's even harder.

278
00:42:41,997 --> 00:42:44,707
Didn't you expect disapproval?

279
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,918
You congratulated me though.

280
00:42:49,379 --> 00:42:51,630
You said:
"I'm glad you came back."

281
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:55,634
"It's not your fault,
nor that of others over there."

282
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,428
That's true.

283
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:02,766
We've been over all this
for long enough now.

284
00:43:05,896 --> 00:43:09,106
I'd just like a bit of comfort today.

285
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:35,961
What'll we do...

286
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:38,339
now?

287
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:48,766
I have no idea.

288
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:56,315
I want to die.

289
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,989
They say that those who
talk about suicide never do it.

290
00:46:04,324 --> 00:46:06,408
But I'm different.

291
00:46:07,327 --> 00:46:09,411
Don't talk silly!

292
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:17,378
I'm useless.
I tell Yuko she must be strong and live.

293
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:22,174
But when it's about me,
I'm completely useless.

294
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:33,143
Let's wait.

295
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:36,980
Just wait and see.

296
00:46:38,942 --> 00:46:41,735
Time will sort everything out in the end.

297
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:50,536
Even waiting...

298
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:55,457
is hard.

299
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:03,424
Let's wait.

300
00:48:13,077 --> 00:48:15,496
<i>"IN MOTHER TERESA'S WORDS"</i>

301
00:48:32,055 --> 00:48:33,639
Isn't that Yuko?

302
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,432
It's been a long time!

303
00:48:36,893 --> 00:48:39,394
Say, you had a narrow escape!

304
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,481
Still living with your father?

305
00:48:43,733 --> 00:48:45,359
Just look at you!

306
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:47,110
You look like an artist.

307
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,737
Babies...

308
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:52,574
Yeah, this one's mine.
They're the same age.

309
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:02,167
What about you?
Not getting married?

310
00:49:03,086 --> 00:49:05,796
What's your boyfriend's name?

311
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:08,048
- Mr. Iwai.
- That's right, Mr. Iwai.

312
00:49:08,383 --> 00:49:10,467
Weren't you going out together?

313
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:13,428
I left him.

314
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:15,222
No!

315
00:49:15,765 --> 00:49:18,433
Mr. Iwai's got another girlfriend.

316
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:19,810
Really?

317
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,856
Yuko, you did know, didn't you?
They're getting married soon.

318
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:26,900
It's true.

319
00:49:27,318 --> 00:49:29,528
Sorry for being so indiscreet.

320
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,366
You should have an arranged marriage.

321
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:38,370
Get married, have a kid.
That'll make you see sense.

322
00:49:38,538 --> 00:49:42,457
Don't be silly, Yuko has
always refused a life like that.

323
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,085
Her world is nothing like ours.

324
00:49:45,253 --> 00:49:49,298
Right, Yuko?
You'll carry on with your work, won't you?

325
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:54,011
Yuko's a good person.

326
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:56,305
We couldn't do what she does.

327
00:49:56,472 --> 00:50:00,142
Absolutely.
We couldn't go and help other people.

328
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,604
We wouldn't have a clue where to start!

329
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:07,733
Yuko!
Hey, let's go for some tea!

330
00:50:43,478 --> 00:50:46,021
I heard your husband lost his job.

331
00:50:50,234 --> 00:50:51,860
So, it's true...

332
00:50:52,487 --> 00:50:54,237
Is it over 'you-know-what?'

333
00:50:56,324 --> 00:50:58,617
It must be that, mustn't it?

334
00:51:02,163 --> 00:51:04,790
What on earth is "That?"

335
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:06,208
You-know-what-

336
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:08,418
Answer me.

337
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:10,545
What's "That?"

338
00:51:10,713 --> 00:51:12,756
What's wrong?

339
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:19,763
You're weird, you know.

340
00:52:14,986 --> 00:52:17,154
It's hard...

341
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,197
Waiting.

342
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:57,387
Want some coffee?

343
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:05,061
I'll make some.

344
01:00:42,451 --> 01:00:43,868
The insurance...

345
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:52,126
Dad's life assurance,
how much is it?

346
01:00:56,048 --> 01:00:58,508
Why do you ask?

347
01:01:00,386 --> 01:01:03,513
I think I'm entitled to it, too.

348
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:10,937
I want to leave.

349
01:01:12,398 --> 01:01:14,357
Go back over there.

350
01:01:16,151 --> 01:01:18,403
They're all waiting for me.

351
01:01:20,489 --> 01:01:22,824
I need some money.

352
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:26,786
Drop it, will you?

353
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:31,082
I'm going to need

354
01:01:33,043 --> 01:01:34,460
that money.

355
01:01:35,504 --> 01:01:36,546
Idiot!

356
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:39,132
Idiot!

357
01:01:47,016 --> 01:01:50,518
Give him back to me!
My husband!

358
01:01:51,395 --> 01:01:53,479
Give me back my husband!

359
01:03:11,266 --> 01:03:13,434
I'd like some soup.

360
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,068
Some soup.

361
01:03:45,634 --> 01:03:47,260
I read the paper.

362
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:52,140
Doesn't it bother you?

363
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:56,144
You killed your father...

364
01:03:56,687 --> 01:03:58,604
And it doesn't affect you?

365
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,650
Don't come back here.

366
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:05,319
I forbid you to.

367
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:17,159
I'd like to book a flight to Amman.

368
01:06:22,499 --> 01:06:24,333
Via Moscow.

369
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:43,477
Mother...

370
01:06:51,069 --> 01:06:52,486
Mother...

371
01:07:00,746 --> 01:07:02,997
I've booked a flight.

372
01:07:05,709 --> 01:07:07,918
I'm leaving next Tuesday.

373
01:07:12,716 --> 01:07:14,759
I won't be coming back.

374
01:10:14,231 --> 01:10:16,273
Are you really going?

375
01:10:23,448 --> 01:10:26,033
Nobody needs me here.

376
01:10:29,204 --> 01:10:31,580
Everybody hates me.

377
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:36,752
It's obvious to me.

378
01:10:39,214 --> 01:10:41,841
It's been like that since I was a child.

379
01:10:43,009 --> 01:10:45,261
At school, I was a bad pupil.

380
01:10:46,096 --> 01:10:48,639
I had few friends.

381
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:51,600
I didn't even have a best friend.

382
01:10:53,478 --> 01:10:56,021
I was dumped by my first love.

383
01:10:57,732 --> 01:11:00,317
I even failed to get into university.

384
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:05,114
I wanted to design clothes,

385
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:08,158
but I couldn't get an apprenticeship.

386
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,788
I failed everywhere.

387
01:11:13,832 --> 01:11:16,125
I may be a dead loss...

388
01:11:22,465 --> 01:11:24,508
But even so,

389
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:27,136
I was useful for the first time.

390
01:11:28,972 --> 01:11:31,515
Beneath the bombs and amid the wounded,

391
01:11:31,725 --> 01:11:35,603
holding a pregnant woman's hand
reassured her.

392
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:41,358
Japanese candy

393
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:45,321
made the children so happy.

394
01:11:46,823 --> 01:11:48,824
They'd crowd around me.

395
01:11:51,036 --> 01:11:53,454
"Yuko!" "Yuko!"

396
01:11:56,082 --> 01:11:57,958
They'd kiss me.

397
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:05,466
I want to live with
those children's smiles...

398
01:12:10,472 --> 01:12:12,514
Otherwise I...

399
01:12:14,726 --> 01:12:16,852
Otherwise I...

400
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:28,781
I do realize, you know,

401
01:12:29,658 --> 01:12:31,992
that I'm just doing as I please.

402
01:12:34,537 --> 01:12:37,206
Dad told me.

403
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:40,125
With charity work

404
01:12:40,502 --> 01:12:42,711
and selfless acts,

405
01:12:44,673 --> 01:12:47,132
at best you embarrass people.

406
01:12:48,009 --> 01:12:50,844
And you never get thanked, that's for sure.

407
01:12:54,808 --> 01:12:57,184
He told me that if I felt ready,

408
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:01,230
he would support me.

409
01:13:03,483 --> 01:13:05,901
He'd do all he could to help me.

410
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:11,949
And now...

411
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:16,161
I'm begging for my share
of the insurance money.

412
01:13:18,206 --> 01:13:20,582
I know I'm saying terrible things.

413
01:13:24,504 --> 01:13:26,088
But you know...

414
01:13:30,218 --> 01:13:32,261
I can't stay here.

415
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:36,724
I don't want to.

416
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:44,523
People here are so cold.

417
01:13:45,942 --> 01:13:49,486
I have to act cold too.

418
01:13:51,948 --> 01:13:53,866
And if I stayed,

419
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:57,494
I would have to become cold.

420
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,459
Just thinking about it...

421
01:14:06,671 --> 01:14:09,048
makes me not want to go on living.

422
01:14:14,512 --> 01:14:16,430
Over there, you feel good.

423
01:14:18,516 --> 01:14:20,434
I feel good.

424
01:14:36,409 --> 01:14:38,077
I loved Dad a lot,

425
01:14:41,664 --> 01:14:43,957
but he was weak.

426
01:14:49,422 --> 01:14:51,131
I'm going to carry on.

427
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:56,136
I'll always side with the others.

428
01:15:11,277 --> 01:15:14,863
Maybe I've acted cold too.

429
01:15:17,075 --> 01:15:19,034
Without realizing it.

430
01:15:30,547 --> 01:15:32,714
It's the first time...

431
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:38,762
the very first time...

432
01:15:39,806 --> 01:15:42,724
you've called me "Mother?"

433
01:15:47,063 --> 01:15:48,772
I'm so pleased.

434
01:16:21,723 --> 01:16:22,973
Here...

435
01:16:25,476 --> 01:16:27,102
For the journey.

436
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:41,617
Thank you.

437
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,831
I won't go with you to the airport.

438
01:16:53,254 --> 01:16:54,755
I understand.

439
01:18:40,278 --> 01:18:44,614
<i>Soon we won't see her anymore</i>

440
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:50,787
<i>The train is leaving</i>

441
01:18:52,957 --> 01:18:57,669
<i>That's it, we can't see her anymore</i>

442
01:18:59,589 --> 01:19:03,925
<i>The train has left, she has gone</i>

443
01:19:06,054 --> 01:19:10,640
<i>When the sun rises, I will return</i>

444
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:16,813
<i>When the sun rises, I will return</i>

445
01:19:18,566 --> 01:19:22,903
<i>One time only I will return</i>

446
01:19:25,448 --> 01:19:29,785
<i>When the sun rises,
One time only</i>

447
01:19:31,913 --> 01:19:35,999
<i>I so liked that girl</i>

448
01:19:38,002 --> 01:19:42,339
<i>But she doesn't live here anymore</i>

449
01:19:44,509 --> 01:19:49,221
<i>I so liked that girl</i>

450
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:55,394
<i>But she doesn't live anywhere anymore</i>

451
01:19:57,438 --> 01:20:01,650
<i>I heard she was all alone</i>

452
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:07,948
<i>I found out she was all alone</i>

453
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:14,913
<i>I thought that this town was very sad</i>

454
01:20:16,874 --> 01:20:21,086
<i>And I fell asleep</i>

455
01:20:23,214 --> 01:20:27,259
<i>Before leaving this town</i>

456
01:20:29,137 --> 01:20:33,390
<i>Before leaving this town</i>

457
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:40,230
<i>I shut the windows</i>

458
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:46,570
<i>And I fell asleep</i>
