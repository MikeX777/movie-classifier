1
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,990
He wasn't greedy
It's like he knew when to give up

2
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,989
If he'd been more aggressive

3
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,497
he could've been president
maybe even lived longer

4
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:59,701
With him gone, though
my life is a lot easier

5
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,999
I sometimes feel guilty that
he's not here to share the fun

6
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,111
Everything was half measures
His job, the family

7
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,884
Well, he had his fun
so cheers

8
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,552
I saw you two going to play golf

9
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,147
Did you?

10
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,120
My husband really liked Hiroshi
very much

11
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,988
You were so honest and modest

12
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,055
Just a country boy

13
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,593
Your father died young
didn't he, Hiroshi?

14
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,035
Yes, I was five, so I don't remember
what he looked like

15
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,673
I rather envy you
My father lived to 98 years old

16
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,108
We got sick of the sight of each other

17
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,851
Mitsuru, have you fed them?

18
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,121
Not yet?

19
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,723
You want to feed them with Daddy?

20
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,119
I'll help you

21
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,570
Excuse us

22
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,771
It's a silly hobby
keeping chickens like that

23
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,948
As he said himself
he's a country boy

24
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,766
Mitsuru, here

25
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,942
Let me in there

26
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,180
Look, a freshly laid egg

27
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,983
It's spring, that's when they
lay a lot of eggs

28
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,356
Little chicks will hatch

29
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,756
Chicks?

30
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:10,392
Then they'll grow up and lay more eggs

31
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,796
They're nice and warm

32
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,042
I've never chanted sutras
to hens before

33
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,512
A little souvenir for you

34
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,753
They're delicious
Not like supermarket eggs

35
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,750
Well, thank you very much

36
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,558
I'll wrap them for you

37
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,752
Thank you

38
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,395
I've stayed far too long
I really must go now

39
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,568
We appreciate your prayers

40
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,421
Why don't we sing a song for
father in heaven?

41
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,537
When I first put to sea
as a sailor man

42
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:25,236
The mast was smashed
and the sails all torn

43
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:30,511
Mighty waves washed over
the wooden deck

44
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,114
But I'll not be troubled
if it's here that I die

45
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:39,356
Awaiting me is my
lovely bride

46
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,885
And my beloved parents
who await me still

47
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,094
More pills?

48
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:07,195
Do you think I should go and
see a psychiatrist

49
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,536
Trouble sleeping again?

50
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,174
No, not really

51
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,972
I dreamed I was pregnant

52
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:18,949
That's not funny

53
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,486
It was just a dream

54
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,288
Good morning

55
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,862
You think too much

56
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,268
I'd better get going

57
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,831
Take care

58
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,867
See you later

59
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,139
You're up early today

60
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,410
Come on, let's go and see
your father off

61
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,689
It's good buy
Trust me, please

62
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,815
I beg your pardon?

63
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:08,524
Something less risky?
Maybe convertible debentures?

64
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,396
Oh, really?

65
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:22,208
My sales are way down
I need your business

66
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,645
You could help me out...

67
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,377
I see
Certainly

68
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,557
I'll set it up for you
Thank you. Bye

69
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,922
I made that man a millionaire!

70
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,599
The buyers are getting a lot smarter

71
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:52,042
No, our company is losing
their trust

72
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,608
Hello?
Nirazaki from Nippo Security

73
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,115
Yes, I've got an excellent buy for you

74
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:13,025
Moodys are downgrading us
it'll be in the newspapers soon

75
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,867
That's the end of our company

76
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,371
It'll take more than that

77
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,508
Are you dreaming?

78
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:35,882
They're already drafting articles
about our bankruptcy

79
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,260
Your brain only works at the office

80
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,962
Do you ever talk to outsiders?

81
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:57,634
No point in competing at a
company that's going down the tubes

82
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,305
I don't think it'll fail

83
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,783
You're living the past

84
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,283
Even banks are failing

85
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:17,456
Look, we're in the same
financial sector

86
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:23,563
In this condition, who's going
to buy our recommendations?

87
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:28,172
Everyone's clawing like crazy
to get out

88
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:35,810
Central Bannk won't intervene
Better start practicing crowd control

89
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,718
How's Mizuho?

90
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,017
What a question

91
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:55,027
She's from a good family
she relies on you, so get it together

92
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,393
Why should you care?

93
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,765
To tell the truth

94
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,811
I've found a new job

95
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,278
That was quick

96
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,048
No, you're just too slow

97
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,325
What about your clients?

98
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:32,601
In days we'll be out in the street
no time for them

99
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,438
Think about your future

100
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,547
No, I really mean it

101
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,760
Is that you, Hiroshi?

102
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,066
Is your name Hiroshi?

103
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,194
Yes...
What can I do for you?

104
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,064
I knew it was you!

105
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,205
You remember me?

106
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,209
You don't, do you?

107
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,820
I guess I can't blame you

108
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,752
You were only five at the time

109
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,917
But I can still see traces of
you as a boy

110
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:11,493
You're looking good

111
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:19,637
I've been so eager to see you
I really missed you

112
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,506
Sorry
I don't recall you

113
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,579
I'm Sasaichi Hamaguchi!

114
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,715
Don't you recognize your own
father's name?

115
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:27,941
My father?!

116
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,011
My father died a long time ago

117
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,122
Kimiyo told you that, eh?

118
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,367
I was wrong to
abandon you like that

119
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,903
I often thought of
coming back to see you

120
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,007
Just never found the chance

121
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,614
What was your name again?

122
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,787
Sasaichi Hamaguchi

123
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,683
I remember Mother did tell me that

124
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,096
I searched everywhere and now
I've found you. Good!

125
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,672
Can you put me up tonight?

126
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,437
Look, it's all so sudden
I can hardly believe it

127
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,644
I don't blame you

128
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,513
I've got so much to tell you
You'll soon come around

129
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,244
Let's have a heart to heart

130
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:43,058
Just you and me, son

131
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,964
Sure...

132
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:02,173
It's strange, he was supposed
to have died ages ago

133
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,607
That's what they said when
you got married

134
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,052
I'll go that

135
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,684
I want to hear, too

136
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,422
You were about 5 years old
at the time

137
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,095
My business went bust
and I was heavily in debt

138
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:25,159
To stop them getting
the money from Kimiyo,

139
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,338
we got a divorce

140
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,639
These days I sell fishing gear
down in Amasaki

141
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,241
As I got older, I began to
worry about you

142
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,745
How did you find out
where I live?

143
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:49,155
Your mother had told
her parents about you

144
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,960
How you graduated and
married into a good family

145
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,168
I had a private detective
search for you

146
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,369
That was five years ago

147
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,001
Five years ago?

148
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,837
So you've know all this time?

149
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:14,416
I was happy to hear you
were alive and doing well

150
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,180
Why didn't you contact me then?

151
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,983
Knowing you were doing well
was enough for me

152
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,927
I'll get you a glass

153
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,597
Ice, too

154
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,359
So I closed down my shop

155
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:36,804
I came to Tokyo
I was eager to see you

156
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,777
It'll be here a week
can I stay till then?

157
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,849
Daddy

158
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,979
Mizuho come get him
And you get into bed

159
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,280
Got a son, have you?

160
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,556
This is just too much

161
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,064
Never thought I'd be sitting
here drinking with my boy

162
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,641
Delicious

163
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,671
Is he staying the night?

164
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,978
I can hardly throw him
out into the street

165
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,385
Is he really your father?
You told me he was dead

166
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,989
That's what I thought

167
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,132
But one thing...

168
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:17,264
Mother sometimes changed her story
after she'd had a drink

169
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,107
What do you mean?

170
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,645
He is your father, isn't he?

171
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,419
I really don't know

172
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:41,588
You don't know?
Then what should I do?

173
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,805
Again, I don't know

174
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,771
I have trouble comprehending
he's my father

175
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,799
I need time to think it over

176
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,585
I can't believe it!

177
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,191
For me?
Thank you!

178
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,926
Miss me?
Of course I did

179
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,733
It's getting harder to get
a full truckload

180
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,737
Of course he's not your father!

181
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,507
Then who is he?

182
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,783
Ignore him
He's just there to sponge off you

183
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,482
My bill
Thank you

184
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,755
He'll stay forever if you let him

185
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,464
Get rid of him

186
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,694
He's a practical man
not like Hiroshi

187
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,273
Is he really Hiroshi's father?

188
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,203
I should ask him to repair
the sliding door

189
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,779
Watch out for the thorns

190
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,248
My hands can take it

191
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,159
At this time of year the branches
are very flexible

192
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:04,863
Cut them now and they'll shoot
new branches and buds

193
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,767
Bantams, aren't they?

194
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,541
No, they're hens

195
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,040
Hiroshi keeps them?

196
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,078
He hated them when he was a kid

197
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,571
Why is he suddenly so eager
to see you now?

198
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:54,350
I heard he was shacked up
with a woman in Amasaki

199
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,515
You knew all along?

200
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,615
The folks in my hometown...

201
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:06,188
were kind enough to tell me

202
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:14,670
So...he really is my father

203
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:21,243
Looks like he believes you're
his son, too

204
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,278
What does that mean?

205
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,444
Just forget it

206
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:30,883
Have nothing to do with him

207
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,681
Mother, Shige should leave

208
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,196
You've lost weight
Are you eating properly?

209
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,228
Of course I am

210
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,066
Wake up!

211
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,128
Shige!
It's time to head out

212
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,898
Thanks for reminding me

213
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,370
Take care

214
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,169
Look...

215
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,541
He was absolutely hopeless

216
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,446
He took half measures
he was a quitter

217
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:07,921
He started out as a deckhand
on a freighter

218
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,885
Then he became an auto-mechanic

219
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,692
After that he borrowed money
to buy a fishing boat

220
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:28,202
He never stuck to any one thing
for very long

221
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,344
He was heavily in debt

222
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:35,349
He wanted to use my money
so I divorced him

223
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,655
Then he went missing

224
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:45,522
The man was a
loud-mouthed braggart

225
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,327
A woman chaser and
a big spender

226
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,798
No redeeming virtues at all

227
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:57,303
So you killed him off and
told me he died?

228
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,803
Forget that

229
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,045
Don't get involved with him

230
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,842
He'll only create problems with
Mizuho and her mother

231
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:15,653
But if he is my father
I can't just ignore him

232
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,819
You should have called me first

233
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:28,565
How's Mitsuru? I really miss him
He must be getting big

234
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,938
Hi there, how is it?

235
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,810
Hello little brother

236
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,148
What brings you here?

237
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,916
Want a beer?

238
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,552
No thanks. I must go

239
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:43,982
Two glasses

240
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,787
You really should see more
of your mother

241
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,491
Don't leave everything to us

242
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,862
Sorry, I'm just so busy

243
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,699
Sit down

244
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,593
What's the news at work?

245
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,656
The newspaper say your
company's going under

246
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,194
Well...
times are tough

247
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:36,972
During the bubble economy
you swaggered about

248
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,937
You're not swaggering now

249
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,510
He'll be fine once the economy picks up

250
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,210
Okay, I'll see you later

251
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,951
But you don't have to worry, do you?

252
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,656
You married into a wealthy family

253
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,621
Right. See you later

254
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,864
Get rid of him as soon as possible

255
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,502
If you don't, it'll only lead to problems

256
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:22,117
Begone ye devils!

257
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,528
What did he want?

258
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,827
I've no idea
but it sounded important

259
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:44,066
Why don't you put your foot down?

260
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,540
He should share in taking care of Mom

261
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:52,249
The diner can't last for much longer

262
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,145
Not so fast

263
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:03,153
I'm working on the franchise deal now

264
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:54,106
Begone de devils!

265
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:04,250
Grandpa!

266
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:10,021
Are you okay, Grandpa?

267
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,627
You must be exhausted

268
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,330
Have a drink

269
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,334
Stop it, Mitsuru
That's enough

270
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,880
It's over

271
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,826
Welcome home

272
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,258
What's going on here?

273
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,332
Father was playing with Mitsuru

274
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,796
He's been ever so helpful today

275
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,800
He repaired the leaking bathtub

276
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:34,734
And the door doesn't squeak any more
He's been wonderful

277
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,351
Come on, Hiroshi
Let's have a drink

278
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,504
Two, six, two

279
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,268
Foul

280
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:09,037
It sure is
Yours are all fouls

281
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,226
Six, one, six

282
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,757
Six, six, one

283
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,869
Do you know what he's
teaching Mitsuru?

284
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:46,449
Gambling! It's embarrassing enough
that he turned up

285
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,446
I want him out of here

286
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,450
So why not tell him?

287
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,589
What does Hiroshi say?

288
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,559
He's always home late

289
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,789
However late, you must talk this out

290
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,171
The man reeks of alcohol

291
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,590
Mitsuru, how about
we have chicken stew for dinner?

292
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,911
I already ate

293
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,917
Look, I've tried to do my best
for your father

294
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,851
But I'm at my limit

295
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,762
He taught Mitsuru how to
play craps

296
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,123
That's no big deal

297
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,892
And your hen!

298
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,333
Your hen...

299
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,073
... is fried chicken

300
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,949
Welcome home

301
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,954
You taught Mitsuru to gamble

302
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,029
Sit down

303
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,832
You remember I taught you craps?

304
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,773
You've been here 10 days now

305
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,242
Just a couple more days

306
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:09,790
That's no end to that
is there?

307
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:13,028
Can you be packed and out
by tomorrow?

308
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:25,165
I'll throw in bullet-train tickets, too

309
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,438
Who in hell do you think I am?

310
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,007
I am your father!

311
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:45,223
Suddenly?
After 30 years of neglect?

312
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,363
So what?
A father is always a father!

313
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,799
Mother and I both...

314
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,908
We don't need you

315
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:32,740
You're the only decent soul
in this house

316
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,680
You're too good for him

317
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,819
You suddenly turn up...
Kill my hen...

318
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,086
What's that?

319
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,392
My hen...

320
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,040
I got you!

321
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:16,102
I thought you had the day off?

322
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,837
Is Mother going out today?

323
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,677
Yes, to some exhibition

324
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,252
What?

325
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,253
I'll talk to him again tonight

326
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,330
When will the chicks be born
Daddy?

327
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:35,832
Well...

328
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:38,928
What's up?

329
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,266
That's the limit!
He's peeping on me!

330
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,041
Peeping?

331
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,423
What are you up to?

332
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,993
I'm sorry!

333
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,830
I... wasn't thinking
Forgive me

334
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,630
What on earth do you think
you're doing?

335
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:25,810
Now get out!

336
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:29,112
Don't be so angry

337
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,970
Okay
Take care

338
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,982
That was fun

339
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,261
''No comment''

340
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,227
Such a pretty girl, that Joanna

341
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,669
What'll we do next?

342
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,934
Let's take Joanna and her friend
to another bar

343
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,506
That tough guy

344
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,510
Too much of a hassle

345
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,122
Better be getting home, then

346
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,787
Yes, I guess so

347
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,058
The company I got a job with...

348
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,396
...needs a few more staff

349
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,608
Why don't you apply?

350
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:38,442
I can't imagine getting another job

351
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,916
You can
We can do anything

352
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,820
We're gamblers by profession

353
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:53,425
Don't you get tired of it?

354
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,871
Unlike you, I can't change
so suddenly

355
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:12,109
Well, we're not getting any younger

356
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,078
Getting old, are we?

357
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:25,351
You look as young as the day
you started

358
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,655
That's because you see me
every day

359
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,024
I guess so

360
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,866
I don't feel like going home

361
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,073
Let's have some noodles

362
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,138
That sounds good

363
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,171
Where's the noodle shop?

364
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,607
Must be one close by

365
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,233
Mother!

366
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,929
What are you saying?

367
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:15,042
You know those tramps in the park?

368
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,004
I saw Hiroshi's father there

369
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,616
Never

370
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,848
He went back home
didn't he?

371
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:57,550
Oh no!
What shall we do?

372
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,450
It is him, isn't it?

373
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,299
Really?
Are you sure it was him?

374
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,509
Yes, I made doubly sure

375
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,647
Good grief!

376
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,748
What's he up to?

377
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,148
How should I know?

378
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,442
Hey, Hiroshi!

379
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,017
What's this?
Whose bike is that?

380
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,457
Stupid old fool!

381
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,286
What's this?

382
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,653
Good

383
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,053
And this?

384
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,328
Very good
What's this?

385
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:16,825
Taful

386
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,764
No. It's a table

387
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,171
Like this table here

388
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:29,539
Now practice your ABC's out loud

389
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,110
I'm going shopping

390
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,317
Alright, dear

391
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,503
Hey, honey!
You after something?

392
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,044
We'll just ignore him

393
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,158
What if something happens?

394
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,424
If he freezes to death
it'll be our fault

395
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:59,601
He's just trying to make us
feel sorry for him

396
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:05,735
He's a lot more cunning than
you think

397
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,311
It's really sad

398
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:17,447
Long-lost one day
homeless the next

399
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:20,890
He's still your father

400
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:26,651
That's why I don't care
Let him stew

401
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:33,430
Maybe he doesn't have a home
to go back to

402
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,634
That's not our problem

403
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,610
He'd only cause trouble here

404
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:47,349
I've heard enough

405
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:52,954
It's so sad

406
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,502
What?

407
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,633
Mizuho!

408
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,115
Are you okay?

409
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,457
Your inhaler

410
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:10,962
These pills work better

411
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,499
Don't take too many

412
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,469
They make me light-headed

413
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,437
The poor man...

414
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:28,711
Come on
You'd better lie down

415
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,397
What is it?

416
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,132
It's just so funny!

417
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:56,044
Your face looks so funny!

418
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,374
Stop it
Stop laughing

419
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,548
Stop it

420
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,083
Mizuho!
Stop it now

421
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,928
Don't laugh!

422
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:30,277
I'm sorry

423
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,614
Why can't you be kind?

424
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:44,956
Why did you have to hit me?

425
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:52,091
Don't cry, Mizuho

426
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:29,961
Hey you, foreigner!
Piss off back to your own country!

427
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,309
You stink!
Piss off!

428
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,991
What's your problem?

429
00:54:58,728 --> 00:54:59,956
You like that do you?

430
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,423
You bum!
Get yourself a bloody job!

431
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,428
Hey! That's enough!

432
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,760
What the hell?

433
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,597
You're on their side?

434
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:09,595
You don't want trouble

435
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:12,034
You have a family, right?

436
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,372
Stop fighting!

437
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,972
You disgust me!

438
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:27,515
Look what you've done
What the hell is your problem?

439
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,558
You're drunk, right?

440
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:33,422
Look at 'em
damn useless vagrants!

441
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,255
So what?

442
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,164
What gives you the right?

443
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,693
You're one of us
why take their side?

444
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,569
Bravery fortified by alcohol

445
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,071
You should be ashamed!

446
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:47,734
You should be!

447
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,971
Damned bums
Piss off back to Shinjuku!

448
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,224
Use this

449
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,297
Goddamn it!

450
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,331
Let's go

451
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,431
Come on

452
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:17,566
Okay
Guys, grab my stuff

453
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,209
He's my son

454
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:24,743
You guys take care

455
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:49,265
What if he decides to
stay here permanently?

456
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:51,269
I shudder at the thought

457
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:55,309
Father!

458
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,745
Your pajamas
I'll leave them here

459
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:02,641
Thank you

460
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:14,057
''Fools cut cherry
only idiots don't cut plum''

461
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,300
Without a man it becomes
a jungle

462
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,497
Mitsuru, I'm not finished!

463
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,940
Grandpa, come and look

464
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,441
What is it?

465
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,189
Listen, they're chirping

466
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:45,153
They are, too
They're little chicks

467
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,736
Baby chicks have hatched!

468
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:04,005
They're so cute
I can't believe it

469
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,004
What?
They hatched, you say?

470
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,752
Double little chicks!

471
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:17,050
Not ''double''
we say ''two chicks''

472
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,651
Aren't they sweet!

473
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,889
We did it!

474
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,791
We did, Daddy!

475
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,928
Mitsuru, you're just like your dad

476
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,311
Look at them eating

477
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:49,155
Let's make a new pen
Separate them from the bantams

478
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:54,752
There'll be lots more
We'll need wire netting

479
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:00,626
Let's get to it, then
I'll take a day off

480
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:21,648
More chickens?
Are they serious?

481
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:35,937
Like father, like son
See how their posture's the same?

482
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,646
Hiroshi, try some of this

483
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,774
Thank you, Mother

484
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,583
Daddy the chicks are dead

485
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,907
Poor little things

486
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:14,636
Dead, are they?

487
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:18,404
How come?

488
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,480
They fell into the water

489
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,344
I just saw them earlier

490
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,086
The bowl's too deep

491
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:44,234
Poor things!
They've hardly drawn breath

492
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:56,178
Don't worry
Plenty more where they came from

493
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:56,404
Nippo Securities Files for Protection

494
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,330
What's up?

495
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,404
I'm going to the office

496
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:37,814
Don't make anything

497
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:03,707
Mr. President... Mr. President

498
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,915
He didn't even mention it?

499
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:18,059
What does ''file for protection'' mean?

500
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:23,426
Are you serious?
It means that they're bankrupt

501
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,598
He still seems to get his salary

502
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,033
He never tells you anything

503
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:35,840
Even something as important as this

504
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,274
He doesn't want us to worry

505
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:49,119
Not worry? When his company's
going out of business?

506
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:50,552
Excuse me!

507
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,129
Anyone here?

508
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,992
Hello in there!

509
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:13,138
I'm looking for Hamaguchi
Sasaichi Hamaguchi

510
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,050
Hiroshi's father?

511
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,991
He came to Tokyo to visit his son

512
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,593
and I haven't heard from him since

513
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:27,862
And who are you?

514
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,265
I'm Yaeko Togashi

515
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,231
In here

516
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,740
Please, sit down

517
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:57,158
Today's racing pick...
''Just Guy''

518
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:11,003
Hey, I'll change my ways
so please come back home

519
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:19,445
I'm sorry I said you should
earn your keep at your age

520
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:25,713
I'm here to apologize
I'm very sorry

521
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:30,758
She's come all this way
Haven't you?

522
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,285
You reckon?

523
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:39,829
How wonderful to have someone
to share your twilight years

524
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,809
I'll look after him

525
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:54,306
We've been together 15 years
like glue

526
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,317
You can do as you like

527
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,091
You can drink

528
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,791
I won't complain any more

529
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,020
I know what you're up to

530
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:12,224
You insured me to the hilt
then put me to work

531
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,562
You're trying to kill me off

532
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,040
You have no inkling of
my feelings

533
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:29,112
You've been gone a month
I've realized how much I miss you

534
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:39,884
Come back!
I miss you

535
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,530
You can hardly refuse
such an appeal...

536
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:47,258
Sweet words mask much

537
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,565
She turned me into an alcoholic

538
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,101
To get me on the
slab that much quicker

539
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,508
Meanwhile, she pockets the insurance

540
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:02,912
It's enough to make the booze
stick in your throat

541
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:08,947
I'm busy

542
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,697
I understand

543
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:22,660
Alright then

544
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:29,570
You want your son to take care of you
then stay here

545
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:36,417
Let me know when he dies
I'll burn incense for him

546
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:42,155
This is ridiculous...
Take good care of him

547
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:50,624
I gave my life to you
I deserve the insurance!

548
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,609
Good riddance!

549
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:09,041
That's the end of that
Sorry for the bother

550
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,147
What a surprise!

551
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:15,683
Who was that woman?

552
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:22,361
He's back there again?
How can I ever apologize?

553
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,295
Yes, of course

554
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:30,494
I'll be there tonight
Alright, see you then

555
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:39,304
Mother, are you going out tonight?

556
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,847
Yes, I have some errands

557
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:47,621
We wanted to talk to you about
redistributing the property

558
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,286
I haven't changed my mind

559
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:56,661
It's me who set up and
ran this shop

560
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:03,701
You can take over when I receive
what we agreed to

561
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:09,934
Then you can change it to a
pinball parlor or a motel

562
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,577
You can do as you please

563
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:48,782
He certainly has a nerve
that man

564
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:55,318
I told Hiroshi that he had died

565
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:59,426
He's only brought trouble
for Mizuho and Hiroshi

566
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:04,828
To think he was my husband of
30 years ago,

567
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:08,669
I could sink through the floor

568
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,093
Please

569
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,006
Hello, Hiroshi

570
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,548
What brings you here?

571
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,852
Leave everything to me

572
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:51,476
Father, if you don't mind

573
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,059
Mother wants to talk to you

574
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:13,930
What?

575
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:21,842
Are you Kimiyo?
You are, aren't you?

576
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:29,509
Don't look at me like that

577
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:34,446
Long time no see, Sasaichi

578
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,957
This is a surprise
I'm dumbfounded

579
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,663
You've gotten old

580
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:53,673
There's something that I must tell you

581
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:59,208
I realize that you're not happy
with this arrangement

582
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:04,885
But all I've got left is Hiroshi

583
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:10,456
He's my only son, he is

584
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:11,988
I am sorry

585
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:18,496
but you're really not Hiroshi's father

586
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:25,767
There's no blood link at all
You're complete strangers

587
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,902
Wait...
Mother!

588
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:32,207
But he really isn't your father

589
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,845
Minoru Kataoka is

590
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:40,483
What did you say?

591
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:44,392
A year before Hiroshi was born

592
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:51,259
that tuna fisherman, Kaikichi
asked you to work for him

593
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,797
You went off to Australia
didn't you?

594
01:12:57,339 --> 01:13:02,834
During those 6 months
that you were away...

595
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:08,314
I fell pregnant with
Minoru's child

596
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:15,156
I did a good job of fooling you

597
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:20,556
But the truth is that Hiroshi
is really Minoru's son

598
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:29,137
There were rumors
you could have heard about it

599
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,402
What does that make me?

600
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,736
You needn't worry

601
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:43,447
Minoru is a man I longed for
when I was young

602
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:50,252
So kind, a real hunk and a leader
of the young men's association

603
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,422
So...

604
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,494
...so that's the story

605
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,968
I'm sorry to upset you
but that's what happened

606
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,776
So that's what happened?

607
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:20,411
So, Minoru is...

608
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:31,791
My husband passed away
3 years ago

609
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,932
I really have no choice

610
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,267
If you take Hiroshi
what's left for me?

611
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,601
He's all I have left

612
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:47,341
Okay, I understand

613
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:53,286
Well I can't stay here
can I?

614
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,152
Hiroshi, I'm sorry about all this

615
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,273
Well, there's no hurry

616
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:17,344
You can stay longer
we've no objections

617
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:20,079
Now I know the facts
I have to go

618
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,382
You just forget all about me

619
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:33,720
Thanks for everything

620
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:53,844
Father!

621
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:59,147
Ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

622
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,266
Come in

623
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:21,374
Why did you wait until
he was critical?

624
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:23,310
Is it that bad?

625
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,177
It's terminal cirrhosis
with extreme complications

626
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:35,949
If he has another attack
he could die

627
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,527
I doubt he'll pull through

628
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,457
I understand

629
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,301
I appreciate it, Doctor

630
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:49,014
Mom, the hen has laid more eggs!

631
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,590
Really?

632
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,061
We'll take them to Grandpa

633
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,663
Will they make him better?

634
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:00,631
Yes

635
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,667
Really?
Yes, dear

636
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:05,903
Put them in the basket

637
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:15,983
Here

638
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,811
Freshly laid
Just this morning

639
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:26,256
Put them over there

640
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:28,425
Certainly

641
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:37,665
I brought some radish relish
You like it, don't you?

642
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:42,075
And some soup, too

643
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,604
Don't worry about me

644
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,482
It wasn't much trouble

645
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:53,719
Grandpa, a picture for you

646
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:56,386
They're just leftovers

647
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:57,989
Hang it up there

648
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,692
Leaving your washing out

649
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,836
I want you to do me a favor

650
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:11,830
What is it?

651
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:17,809
I'd like some sake

652
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:26,210
No, you can't
A small bottle will do

653
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:28,350
I can't do that

654
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:35,361
The doctor will be furious and
after all, this is a hospital

655
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,503
So just forget all about drinking!

656
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:54,678
Even if he isn't your real father
he took care of you as a boy

657
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,883
So let's do what we can for him

658
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,846
But that costs money

659
01:21:02,224 --> 01:21:05,990
I have savings
I can pay the hospital bill

660
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,823
You've never lacked for anything

661
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:12,761
Maybe so
but please

662
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:17,628
You've never known hardship

663
01:21:32,754 --> 01:21:41,128
Morning has broken
Dawn has come

664
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:44,597
No matter what they say
a man needs a drink

665
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:48,531
That's the truth

666
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:52,771
Hearts bursting with pride...

667
01:21:53,041 --> 01:22:09,322
The pride of men who go to sea

668
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:32,176
Okay, cut it out!
The staff are furious with you

669
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:36,708
They'll kick you out
if you don't stop now

670
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,380
We'd better go

671
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,850
You take care of yourself

672
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:10,912
Cover up

673
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:34,000
I was but a lad of fourteen years

674
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:43,042
When first I put to sea as
a sailor man

675
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:48,118
The first time our ship cleared the port

676
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:56,227
The mast was smashed and
the sails all torn

677
01:23:56,631 --> 01:24:02,501
Mighty waves washed over
the wooden deck

678
01:24:02,804 --> 01:24:13,976
But I'll not be troubled
if it's here that I die

679
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,179
That song...

680
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,251
It's our song, lad

681
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:39,666
When first I put to sea as
a sailor man

682
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:45,570
The mast was smashed and
the sails all torn

683
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:50,849
Mighty waves washed over
the wooden deck

684
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:55,885
But I'll not be troubled
if it's here that I die

685
01:24:56,191 --> 01:25:00,389
Awaiting me is my lovely bride

686
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:05,793
And my parents
more important to me

687
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:11,633
Neptune beckons me...

688
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:25,252
I really am your son after all

689
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:35,051
As Kimiyo says
I might be infertile

690
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:55,481
Offer up prayers
and make your vows

691
01:25:56,217 --> 01:26:05,853
To Neptune
the King of all Seas

692
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:15,064
Mighty Neptune
will you quieten the storm?

693
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:24,369
For just a little while
for just a little while

694
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:34,472
I wonder how he is?

695
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,242
Well...

696
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:43,145
I visited the hospital today
but he was fast asleep

697
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,113
He's like that recently

698
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:56,227
The man's nuisance whether
he's sick or well

699
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:01,729
It's too bad

700
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:27,017
What are you doing?

701
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,862
Shall I make a snack?

702
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,536
Listen...

703
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,104
Look...

704
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:49,416
I must apologize to you

705
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,545
What for?

706
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,216
The company's restructuring plan
was rejected

707
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:04,164
That means they're bankrupt

708
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:14,940
You only ever give results

709
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:18,138
It was all so sudden

710
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:27,788
You never discuss anything
You never have

711
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:34,292
You turned your back on
your own father

712
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:40,195
Selfishly thinking
only you've suffered

713
01:30:45,973 --> 01:30:48,066
Maybe you're right

714
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:54,481
Did I really enjoy my work?

715
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,182
There'll be no final payment

716
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,190
I don't know what to do

717
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,479
Hello, Nirazaki residence

718
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:38,722
It's the hospital!

719
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:41,562
Your father's dying!

720
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,123
Take the call

721
01:31:57,311 --> 01:32:00,644
We should've contacted you earlier

722
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:08,252
I never knew if he wanted to
live or not

723
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:25,136
My sincere regrets

724
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:14,481
Let's go
Let's go home

725
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:43,679
Little chicks!
This is incredible!

726
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:51,984
He said he would try to hatch them

727
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:55,260
And he did it!

728
01:33:57,665 --> 01:34:04,798
He didn't eat those eggs
He nurtured them

729
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:12,504
Who would ever have imagined?

730
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,831
Father...

731
01:35:20,981 --> 01:35:23,347
Spreading his ashes, how sad

732
01:35:25,753 --> 01:35:29,746
I bet he's happy
He loved a ceremony

733
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:31,816
I wonder...

734
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:38,130
I never saw the body
so I keep expecting him to turn up

735
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:42,324
If he did, would you insure him again?

736
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:45,230
Don't say that!
I was good to him

737
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,200
It was such a short time...

738
01:35:49,176 --> 01:35:51,610
You seem to be getting younger

739
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:58,416
Really?
Do you think so?

740
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:00,951
Shall we begin?

741
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:02,885
I suppose we must

742
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:17,763
Will normal funerary prayers do?

743
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:19,699
Anything, I suppose

744
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:24,468
Great God of Compassion...

745
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:35,319
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

746
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:07,986
Doesn't Hiroshi take after him?

747
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:12,859
You lied, didn't you?

748
01:37:19,733 --> 01:37:21,564
I'll keep a piece of him

749
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:31,535
Which bone was it?

750
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:42,721
I'll have to find a new job

751
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:50,361
Don't worry
Life will go on

752
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,535
You know, I'm quite strong

753
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:05,239
Even so
it's a long haul...

754
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:16,389
Mitsuru!
You've got a strong mother!
