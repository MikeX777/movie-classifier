1
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:01,416
- This is a
Manhattan bound local train.

2
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,124
- Albert...

3
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:08,875
Albert...

4
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:12,417
Albert...

5
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:44,542
Albert...

6
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,083
- Hey!

7
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:00,333
Hey buddy, how you doing?

8
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:02,792
Hello!

9
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,083
- Can we have two hot dogs please?

10
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,166
- Thank you.

11
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:13,167
Uh...

12
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,708
Buddy, I'm guessing that hot
dog is not for me, right?

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,500
- No, that one's not for you.

14
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,708
- Okay, alright, who's it for then?

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,750
- Pays for tomorrow's customers.

16
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,708
- And how do we know that
the hot dog you're giving me

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,166
wasn't on the ground?

18
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,583
- Here's your hot dog, okay,

19
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,083
it's nice and clean and fresh.

20
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,416
- Buddy, that is disgusting, okay?

21
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,333
I'm totally gonna call the
health department on you.

22
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,916
- Look, do you want your hot dog or not?

23
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,499
- Why would I want that shit?

24
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,833
What the hell's the matter with you, dude'?

25
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,166
- Excuse me, good people?

26
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,041
I think the rule of thumb
is if you want a hot dog,

27
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,541
you gotta buy it, right?

28
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,541
Okay?

29
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,708
No sense in sweating these
little things, right?

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,833
They'll drive you crazy.

31
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:53,958
- Listen, buddy.

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,375
Did you see this pig?

33
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,292
He dropped it on the ground,

34
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,166
and then he placed it
back up on the grill.

35
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:01,999
What do you think about that?

36
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,542
- I think you should just
pay the man, walk away,

37
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,624
find yourself a little fancy restaurant...

38
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:08,417
- I think you should just
mind your own business,

39
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,708
find your own hot dogs...

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,166
- Actually, I'd like a hot dog.

41
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,499
- I bet you would.

42
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,292
I bet you would like a hot dog.

43
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,374
- Let's go babe, okay?

44
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,417
- I'll take that hot dog right over there.

45
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,291
- Listen you fat fuck-

46
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,916
yeah, that's right, I went there.

47
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,208
I'm sorry, that's where I went.

48
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,291
- You didn't go far enough,
cause if you did, you'd be home.

49
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,249
- Yeah, that's great, thanks,
yeah, I'm gonna go home now.

50
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:27,083
- Take yourselves right
back up to that graveyard

51
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,541
you call the Upper East Side.

52
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,041
- Just ignore him.

53
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:30,999
- This looks terrific.

54
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:32,208
- Yeah, I bet
you like that hot dog.

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,041
- I sure do,

56
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,583
this is what a real hot
dog looks like, darling.

57
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,625
- Are you fucking serious?

58
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:36,458
Really?

59
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,333
- Stop doing this, please stop-

60
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,166
- are you serious?

61
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,583
- I am absolutely serious.

62
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,750
- That's how you talk to a lady?

63
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,208
- Actually, I thought that
was a culinary opinion.

64
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,958
- I bet you know about
culinary opinions, bud.

65
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,875
- Yeah, I know more than a couple.

66
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,042
- You have a good night.

67
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,833
- Good night.

68
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:50,916
- Snob shit.

69
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,916
This town is filled with em.

70
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,999
It's a darn good hot dog.

71
00:03:58,292 --> 00:03:59,125
What do I owe you?

72
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,125
- Two dollars.

73
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:01,250
- Two dollars.

74
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,417
Keep the change.

75
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:03,833
- Thank you.

76
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:04,916
- What's your name, anyway?

77
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,333
- Albert.

78
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,500
You know, the heat from the grille

79
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,000
actually helps keep the hot
dogs clean and germ free.

80
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:13,542
- Really?

81
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,583
You're a smart one.

82
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,750
I'll see you around, kid.

83
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,750
- Responding officers
felt they had no choice

84
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,667
but to shoot the suspect multiple times

85
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,541
to end his vicious attack.

86
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,541
The 68 year old victim
was fighting for his life

87
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,374
in the front of a hospital.

88
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,333
- You're a lazy man.

89
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:02,792
- I know.

90
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,708
- Why you make mess?

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,875
- What?

92
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,458
- Why you make mess, dirty man?

93
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,083
- Look...

94
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,541
Why are you late?

95
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,249
- Savoy does not work.

96
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:16,417
- Oh, I hate it when that happens.

97
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,291
- I'll take over, see you later.

98
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,208
Okay.

99
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,458
What are you doing?

100
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,125
- Taking your picture.

101
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,667
- Why?

102
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,083
- It's my job.

103
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,833
I'm a photographer.

104
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,041
- You should ask for permission first.

105
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:51,958
- Really?

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,375
Well, okay.

107
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:55,625
Tell you what.

108
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,249
Here's your permission.

109
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,708
Okay.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,416
- So you like money, huh?

111
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,124
You want to make some more'?

112
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,458
- I don't know.

113
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,749
- I'm not suggesting anything untoward.

114
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:14,874
I was thinking about a job.

115
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,167
- What kind of job?

116
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,083
- Art.

117
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,374
Real art.

118
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,125
- I don't know anything about art.

119
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,708
- I could teach you.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,375
- I already have a job, I don't have time.

121
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:28,042
- Oh yeah?

122
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,999
I'll give you my business card.

123
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,500
And here's a little out of incentive.

124
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:35,417
Make time.

125
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,083
- Hey!

126
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,333
Albert!

127
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:07,291
- Hey!

128
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,291
- How's it going?

129
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,624
- Long time no see.

130
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,792
- I've been trying to find
a job lately, actually.

131
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,499
But I haven't eaten in a while,

132
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:16,958
can I have a hot dog'?

133
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,541
- Yeah, sure, but I gotta
go to the bathroom first,

134
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,249
could you just watch the
hot dog stand for me'?

135
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:24,750
- Sure, Albert.

136
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:25,833
- Thank you.

137
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,917
- The
onion crunch, I like it.

138
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,499
- Yeah, you should actually
try the onion crunch dog,

139
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:51,917
because it's really good.

140
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:56,291
Especially, like, with
the onion, super crunchy.

141
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:57,541
Is that your camera?

142
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,958
- Yeah, yeah.

143
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,416
Night street photography is my thing.

144
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,749
- Oh, wow, cause I have some contacts

145
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:07,625
that actually help you get
your stuff in galleries.

146
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,375
- I'm not quite at that level yet.

147
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,542
I think I need some more
practice, what do you think?

148
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,374
- Let me see.

149
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,625
- I like this one.

150
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:15,625
- You took all of these?

151
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:16,458
- Yeah.

152
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,458
- Can I help you with something?

153
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,875
- Yeah, can I get a hot
dog and a soda please?

154
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:23,458
You know, for some reason, i
thought you were the vendor.

155
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,458
- Oh, no, I was just watching
it for my friend Albert.

156
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,958
- Good friend.

157
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,666
I figured you were too
hot for this anyway.

158
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:31,583
- Um...

159
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,874
Albert, can I have a hot dog too?

160
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:37,167
- That'll be five dollars.

161
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,666
- Can you charge me for hers too?

162
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,833
- Oh, actually, I get them
for free from Albert, so...

163
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,875
But you could buy me a beer instead,

164
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,125
and we could look at
some more of your photos.

165
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,375
- Sounds like a plan.

166
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,417
- Albert, is my hot dog ready?

167
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,333
Thank you!

168
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,625
- Well, look what the cat dragged in.

169
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,625
Our model has finally arrived.

170
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,958
Welcome to my studio, Albert.

171
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,166
- Honey!

172
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,083
Hi honey!

173
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:29,958
Hello?

174
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,041
Hi, I'm Nancy, I'm with wardrobe.

175
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,083
Okay?

176
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,416
I have some paperwork
i need you to fill out,

177
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,624
so come with me,

178
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:36,792
we're gonna put it over here,

179
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,541
and then we'll get you changed,

180
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,499
so fill this out for me, okay?

181
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,875
Here, let's put this
down, we'll put it here.

182
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,917
I'm just gonna have you sign right there.

183
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,124
- What is this?

184
00:12:49,417 --> 00:12:53,708
- It's just legal, standard
legal, don't worry about it.

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,791
- I would like to read it first.

186
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,166
- Read it later, Albert.

187
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,791
It's a basic model's release form.

188
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,874
Just protecting you and me,

189
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,833
legally and otherwise.

190
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,666
- We're just gonna take your shirt off.

191
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,833
- Why?

192
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,250
- Just...

193
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,625
- Albert, it's part
of the job, just do it.

194
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:11,542
- Come on.

195
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,041
We have a robe, it's alright.

196
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,416
Do you need help?

197
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,958
You know, you do have a nice body.

198
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,542
- Ivan, she's ready.

199
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,249
- Thank you, Jackie.

200
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:34,083
Nancy?

201
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:34,916
- Just about!

202
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,083
- Ls Albert ready?

203
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,083
- You're good?

204
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,541
- We're in a very
animated mood, aren't we?

205
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,458
Albert, lose the robe.

206
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,166
Oh, I love it.

207
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,792
Terrific, go stand next to her.

208
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,625
- Hi.

209
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,417
- Okay, now, Albert,

210
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,416
I want you to get
acquainted with Sarah, okay,

211
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,583
because we're gonna make
a little scene here.

212
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,583
- He's so shy.

213
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,500
- Oh, he is shy, but he's
not gonna be shy in a minute.

214
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:18,292
- I think I'm his first girlfriend.

215
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,999
- Oh, yeah, that's it.

216
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,958
She's your girlfriend,
she's your girlfriend.

217
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,833
Do you remember your first girlfriend?

218
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,458
Remember, you want to get to second base?

219
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,416
Now get closer to her.

220
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:28,791
- Have you been to second base before?

221
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,249
- Think of the Madonna, you know?

222
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,250
And you're like the baby Jesus.

223
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,417
Take him there, Sarah.

224
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,374
She's kind of like mama.

225
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,375
Don't you want to go home to mama?

226
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:41,417
Think about going home to mama

227
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,499
after a hard day at school.

228
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,625
The first thing you do is
you hug mama, don't you?

229
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:47,458
- He's getting excited now.

230
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,125
- Uh oh, he's a
growing boy, isn't he?

231
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:50,292
He's already...

232
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,958
- You're a big boy.

233
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,416
- My goodness, why don't
you give mommy a big hug'?

234
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,249
Yeah, show mommy some love.

235
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:56,583
Oh, but you know what you want.

236
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,750
That safety of returning.

237
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,667
Give mama a hug, that's right.

238
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,874
Don't you want to unhook her
bra and feel her titties'?

239
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,375
Don't you want to know what
they feel like in your hand?

240
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:07,375
- Doesn't that turn you on?

241
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,500
- Oh my goodness, Sarah,

242
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:09,333
why don't you feed him a strawberry.

243
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,500
I think he's hungry, he
wants you to feed him.

244
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:11,625
- Are you hungry?

245
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,083
I think he's hungry.

246
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,500
Is that what you want'?

247
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:15,833
- Yes he does.

248
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,958
He needs his fruits and
vegetables, he's a growing boy.

249
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,500
- Some milk, it's a little creamy.

250
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:20,958
- Mmm, look at that cream, wow.

251
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,458
Look at that cream!

252
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,625
- Take it all!

253
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,042
- Oh yeah, take it into your mouth.

254
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,124
Yum yum yum.

255
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,291
Bring her closer to you,
bring her closer to you.

256
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,958
That's right, that's right.

257
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,666
Okay, Nancy, can you hand me the bag'?

258
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,333
Give it to Albert.

259
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,041
Okay, Albert, put the bag over her head.

260
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:37,874
- What's this?

261
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,625
- It's a bag, we're gonna
put it over her head.

262
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:40,458
She wants it.

263
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,750
- Just put it over my
head, it turns me on.

264
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:42,583
- That's right.

265
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,416
- Why?

266
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,291
- Because she likes it.

267
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,124
- Because it's sexy.

268
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,375
You're sexy, be sexy!

269
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:47,792
- Put it over her head, Albert.

270
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,374
- Come on, put it over
my head, don't be scared.

271
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,500
- Oh yeah, she wants it.

272
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:51,917
Look how horny she is, my god!

273
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,499
Oh my god, look at those sugar walls

274
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,542
part for you like the red sea!

275
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,458
She wants it, she's really
horny, can't you see her?

276
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,166
Look at her, she's dripping,

277
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,041
she's giving you a platinum
shower with the cup juice.

278
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,291
Look at that, your hands are hugging her.

279
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,541
Harder, harder!

280
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,499
Harder, strangle the shit out of her!

281
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:11,917
Choke her hard!

282
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:13,583
She loves it!

283
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:20,375
That's it, that's it, we've got it.

284
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:21,833
Thank you.

285
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,000
Thank you, that's a wrap.

286
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,374
Excellent, people.

287
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,458
Sir, I'd like you to stay.

288
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,291
Okay man, good job.

289
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,541
- Look at you!

290
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,333
Little something for later.

291
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,708
- So when am I gonna start working?

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,416
- You already did.

293
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,916
Wasn't that easy'?

294
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,875
- But I thought I was going
to be taking pictures.

295
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,917
- Albert, in order to take good photos,

296
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,708
you need a lot of knowledge
and a lot of skill, okay?

297
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,375
- That's why I'm here, i
want to learn about art.

298
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,667
- Look, buddy, what more do you want?

299
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,874
I don't think you've had a
better deal in your life.

300
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,167
- I want to learn.

301
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,166
Or...

302
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,166
- Or what?

303
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,749
- Or I won't come back here again.

304
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:14,583
- Alright, from now on,
you're my assistant.

305
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,791
It's just that right now, this
is how you're assisting me.

306
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,708
You need to be a lot more
patient, Albert, okay?

307
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,666
What do we always say,
Patience is a virtue?

308
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,583
Yeah, I need you to be
more virtuous, okay?

309
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,500
Alright, we'll talk about this later.

310
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:28,500
- Let's go.

311
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:33,750
- Bye, Albert.

312
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,542
- I need to go to the restroom.

313
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,749
- Okay, but, you know, hurry it up.

314
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:41,083
- Just right around the corner.

315
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,500
You're up to something.

316
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,208
- I'm telling you, he is gold, okay?

317
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,458
- How is he gold?

318
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,375
- He's gonna be the
centerpiece of my next show.

319
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,708
- But where did you find him?

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,583
- He's a hot dog vendor.

321
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,041
- Oh, you're making this up.

322
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,333
- Why would I make that up?

323
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,250
- Wait a second, what were
you doing eating hot dogs?

324
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,833
- Yeah, what happened to your diet?

325
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,958
- I walked by a cart, I see this clown,

326
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,416
and I think-

327
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,624
Eureka!

328
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:29,833
- Albert!

329
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,833
- Oh, speak of the devil,
here he is, Albert.

330
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,125
Man of the hour, right?

331
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,333
- Thank you, time to go, thank you.

332
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,250
- It was nice working with you.

333
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:41,500
- Good job there, Albert.

334
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:43,042
- Take care.

335
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,708
- I'll be in touch.

336
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,124
- You're gonna come back
here, enjoy doing it?

337
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,875
- I don't think so.

338
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,042
- Really?

339
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,291
- I wanted to learn about art.

340
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,458
- But you had a hot girl, that's art.

341
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,083
- You like the pretty girl, though.

342
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,625
- Come on, he likes the girl right?

343
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,000
- Admit it!

344
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,458
- Pretty girls are nice.

345
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,250
- I did like the pretty girl.

346
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:13,375
- He liked the pretty girl.

347
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,042
- He'll be back, he'll be back.

348
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,000
- You know where to go, Albert?

349
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:25,417
- No, wait, I forgot my bag upstairs.

350
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,374
- You can get it tomorrow,
you can get it another time.

351
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,375
Come on, let's go.

352
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,792
- No, I need it now.

353
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,291
How do I get back up again?

354
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,124
- Go on up.

355
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:33,167
- Go on.

356
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,874
It's alright, just push the button.

357
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,417
You'll find your way.

358
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,916
Go on, Albert.

359
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,749
You'll find your way.

360
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,791
- Oh yeah, you like that?

361
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,874
Better get me more work!

362
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,958
You'll pay me double next week?

363
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,041
- We'll see about that.

364
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,291
It depends on what you give me, okay?

365
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,166
- You better pay me double!

366
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,749
- I'm gonna put
that bag over your head.

367
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:25,125
- Yeah, you want to be so dirty,

368
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,167
why don't you give me more work?

369
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,583
- How dirty do you want it?

370
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,000
- I can be as dirty as you want.

371
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,874
Ready to put another bag over my head?

372
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:38,583
- You like it
when he strangles you,

373
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:39,666
you little bitch?

374
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,291
- Yeah, I love it!

375
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,583
Pay me double.

376
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,166
- Yeah, you'll get double.

377
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,083
I like strangling you.

378
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,583
- Have some passion, baby!

379
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:06,458
Put that bag over my head!

380
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,625
- She loves it!

381
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:08,458
Harder!

382
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,750
- Fire!

383
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,083
- Hello, miyoki.

384
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,208
- See how clean this is?

385
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,916
You make clean.

386
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,041
- I might be getting a new job soon.

387
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,708
- A new job?

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
- Yeah, I'm gonna be making a lot of money

389
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,542
as a photographer.

390
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,166
- My cousin can have your job!

391
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,208
- Yeah, it's going to be great.

392
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,708
I just had my first day yesterday.

393
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,291
- Please keep clean, okay?

394
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,708
- Okay, see you.

395
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,624
- Hi.

396
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,375
Can we have two hot dogs please?

397
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:56,625
And could you please take a picture of us?

398
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,292
- Yeah, sure, I'm a
photographer, you know.

399
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,874
Okay, I need you to stand closer together.

400
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:11,167
Okay, now pretend that
you're eating the hot dogs,

401
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,333
and you're really hungry.

402
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,333
Open your mouths.

403
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,250
Wider.

404
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,333
Wider.

405
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:25,541
Yeah, that's perfect.

406
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,874
- No, this is great.

407
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:34,333
This picture's great.

408
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,166
- Thank you.

409
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,250
- I gotta tell you something.

410
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:45,083
I've got something really really
good I've got to show you.

411
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,500
- Oh yeah, really?

412
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,375
Is it another hot girl, Ivan?

413
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,250
- No, no, this is...

414
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,667
I've found quite a specimen.

415
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,375
He looks like a fucking bagboy in a deli.

416
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,750
From a deli in hell.

417
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:03,667
I mean, he's gonna put
me in the history books.

418
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,791
- That gives me a hard on.

419
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,874
- It's better than whitkin, arbis...

420
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,374
He's so fucking...

421
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,292
- Wow, that's exciting, Ivan.

422
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,624
Sounds like yummy butter to me.

423
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:24,208
- On baby.

424
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,041
Where are you?

425
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:25,874
- Milan.

426
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:26,833
- Oh, really?

427
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:27,666
- Yeah.

428
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,499
I'm working for this magazine,

429
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,833
and we might have a big job for you,

430
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,500
cause their photographer's super poopy.

431
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:35,500
- Oh yeah?

432
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:38,042
- Yeah, they're not 100% sure,

433
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,083
but if they do need you, it's 25k.

434
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,000
- Oh man.

435
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,333
Don't get me too excited here.

436
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,708
When will you know?

437
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,291
- Probably by tomorrow,

438
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,958
so I need you to be ready to travel

439
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,500
at a moment's notice, okay?

440
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,000
- Yeah, okay.

441
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,375
That's fine.

442
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:58,250
Alright, well, you know, keep me posted.

443
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,625
- I will, and don't even bother

444
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:00,875
bringing any equipment here.

445
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,375
We've got everything ready.

446
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,500
Just get ready to impress these people.

447
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:05,917
- Yeah, will do.

448
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:08,708
Okay, cheers.

449
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,041
- Bye.

450
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:14,791
- Little bastard.

451
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:06,667
- Hello?

452
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,916
- What's up, good looking.

453
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,499
- Oh, hello, Ivan.

454
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:17,583
- Are you ready for the next one?

455
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,416
- Next what?

456
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:20,666
Next job?

457
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:23,416
- Of course the next job.

458
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:27,333
- Okay, but I don't
want to model this time.

459
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,750
I want to learn.

460
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,708
- Again with this shit?

461
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,541
I thought we were clear.

462
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:38,333
You model, and I teach you photography.

463
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:42,208
- Yeah, but last time
you only had me modeling.

464
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,125
I want to learn photography.

465
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,375
- Okay.

466
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,874
Come to the studio,

467
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:53,083
I'll take some pictures
and then I'll teach you.

468
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,541
- How about this, you teach me,

469
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,374
and next time I'll model for you.

470
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,208
- Look, Albert.

471
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,041
I'm being too good already.

472
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,666
Now if you try to take advantage of me,

473
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,124
I'd rather work with someone else.

474
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,458
- Okay, find somebody else.

475
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,124
Hello?

476
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,083
Who's there?

477
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:43,416
. Daddy.

478
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,292
As in sugar daddy.

479
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,124
Hello, Albert.

480
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:52,458
- What do you want?

481
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,916
I told you I'm done modeling,

482
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,541
I don't want anything to do with you.

483
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:56,666
I don't want you here.

484
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:57,958
Go away.

485
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:58,791
- Fair enough,

486
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,499
but let's not be completely ungracious.

487
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,667
In fact, I brought you something.

488
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:03,874
Wow, is this your place?

489
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:05,208
It's fantastic.

490
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:07,791
Wow, what is that?

491
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,208
What an amazing use of cardboard.

492
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,791
- No, don't take any pictures!

493
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,958
I told you, no fucking pictures, okay!

494
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,708
- Okay, okay, well,
open what I brought you.

495
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,541
Yeah.

496
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,291
Isn't she something?

497
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,542
That was my first camera.

498
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:37,708
I got a lot of early
attention from that camera.

499
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,833
Got my first show with that camera.

500
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,500
Yeah, I was nobody.

501
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,541
I wasn't as lucky as you are

502
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:48,041
to have somebody take him under his wing.

503
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,125
No, but you see,

504
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:54,875
I just see so much
potential in you, Albert.

505
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:56,791
Do you know what I mean?

506
00:28:57,083 --> 00:29:00,374
I got this weird sixth sense
when it comes to real artistry.

507
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,208
It's spotting a real artist.

508
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,208
My only question is, are you ready?

509
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,791
- Ready for what?

510
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,958
- Ready for what?

511
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,125
Ready to snort coke off
the tits of some model

512
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,500
on the beaches of Saint tropez!

513
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:19,125
To go skiing with the jet set in gestadt.

514
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:22,625
To go on safari with silicon valley CEOs.

515
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,416
To live the life.

516
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,291
To get the best tables
at the best restaurants,

517
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:29,041
to hemorrhage money.

518
00:29:30,292 --> 00:29:32,625
To get yourself a real place.

519
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:36,083
To not live like a nobody.

520
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,666
Are you ready for the life'?

521
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,499
- I don't know, maybe.

522
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:41,333
" Maybe?

523
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,208
Maybe as badgirl stares
at you from the wall,

524
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,333
you're just gonna jerk off to
her for the rest of your life?

525
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,250
<i>- No.</i>

526
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,625
- Or...

527
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,292
Who's the other lady here?

528
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,666
Miss August.

529
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,791
Stare back at you while you jerk off'?

530
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,958
Is that all you want out of life?

531
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,291
To be a nobody for the rest of it?

532
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,333
<i>- No.</i>

533
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,583
- No?

534
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:04,458
So my question is, can I count on you?

535
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,750
- Yeah.

536
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:06,667
- Yeah?

537
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:07,499
- Yeah!

538
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,167
- Well then, you know what?

539
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:10,874
You and I are gonna take a photo,

540
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:14,208
because this moment must be documented.

541
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,083
Smile.

542
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:29,041
- The fuck are you doing?

543
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:29,958
- I'm making art.

544
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,041
Real art.

545
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,416
- Dumb mother fucker.

546
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:33,833
Get out of here.

547
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:43,542
- I think it's another work of art,

548
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:46,291
just the way you like it.

549
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,541
- Maybe just a little more on the face.

550
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:48,541
Okay.

551
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:49,874
- How are you doing there, sport?

552
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,083
- Yeah, I'm alright, I guess.

553
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,416
- You're alright you guess?

554
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,208
You better know, cause i
got a really expensive model

555
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,000
waiting on the set for you, okay?

556
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,917
And when you see her,
you're gonna get crazy.

557
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,708
- Where do you find these models?

558
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,375
- Where do I find them?

559
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:07,542
I book them.

560
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:08,791
" How?

561
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:09,791
" How?

562
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,208
Because I'm-

563
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,708
I'm too modest to say,

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,125
maybe you could explain
to him how I book models.

565
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:20,917
I'm one of the city's best
photographers, that's how.

566
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,374
- He pays them.

567
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,292
- A lot.

568
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,333
- How would I find models?

569
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,875
- Probably the way I did
when I was starting out.

570
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,667
On the street, you know?

571
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,916
You walk up to somebody,
you charm them a little bit.

572
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:38,416
You know how to be charming, don't you?

573
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,458
- Yeah.

574
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,083
- Yeah, you sure do.

575
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,875
Okay, we're ready to go.

576
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:43,708
Let's go.

577
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,875
- Yep, think you're done.

578
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,125
- Well, well, well.

579
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:57,042
She's looking great there, Nancy.

580
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,708
Albert, get on set.

581
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:07,250
Okay, Albert, say hello
to the pretty piggy.

582
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,583
Say hello to that lovely,
lovely, pink, little piggy.

583
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,916
Say hi.

584
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:12,916
- Hi.

585
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,749
- Hi, I'm Albert, and
i love pretty piggies!

586
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,500
Yeah, touch the pretty piggy!

587
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:19,958
Yeah, you love that, right?

588
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,708
You love, love, love that.

589
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,250
You love that so much

590
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:25,125
that you want to kill her!

591
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:26,292
Kill the pig!

592
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:28,458
That's right, piggy.

593
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,708
You're about to die because
butcher Albert's come to town!

594
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,166
The demon butcher of meat street!

595
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,208
Kill that pig!

596
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,791
Yeah, yeah, look at her
writhing in pain, oh my god.

597
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,374
This is your destiny, sweetie,

598
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:44,708
cause this is where you meet the butcher.

599
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,166
You were born to be butchered,

600
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,499
sad destiny of a little piggy.

601
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,375
She never knew it could be this bad.

602
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,667
Oh, it's unbearable, it's unbearable.

603
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,333
That's a sad way for a little piggy

604
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:56,875
to meet her end, isn't it?

605
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:57,875
But Albert's a butcher.

606
00:33:58,167 --> 00:33:59,875
You like taking pretty pink flesh,

607
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,667
pretty piggy flesh.

608
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,666
Yeah, that's you, Albert, that's you.

609
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,291
Grab those tongs over there.

610
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,833
Grab the pitchfork, grab the pitchfork.

611
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:07,833
That's it.

612
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,416
That's a big dildo you've got
in your hand there, Albert,

613
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:13,166
because you're not man
enough to use your own cock!

614
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,666
Now take that pitchfork
and shove it in her gut!

615
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:18,624
Who knew you were born to die so young,

616
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,708
so pretty, and so piggy?

617
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,791
And you can spit on him.

618
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,041
Spit on the butcher.

619
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,416
That's it, spit on that
filthy fucking butcher!

620
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:27,749
He's a piece of shit!

621
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,417
This is what he's done to you.

622
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:30,416
Look at him.

623
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:31,458
He's a piece of shit.

624
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,791
Now drag her over to the grill.

625
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,124
Do it like a man!

626
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:37,917
That's it, baby, that's
it, let her sizzle.

627
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,958
Look at you, you want to
turn her into a hot dog,

628
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,291
and then you want to sell it back

629
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,583
to the streets of New York!

630
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,583
Isn't that what you do,

631
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,583
you little demon butcher of meat street?

632
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,541
Look at you, look, she's
gonna turn into hot dogs.

633
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,166
Look at that piggy ass.

634
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:52,499
Let her sizzle.

635
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:53,583
Then you're gonna eat it,

636
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:54,750
you're gonna eat it all, aren't you,

637
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:55,750
cause you're a cannibal.

638
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,083
You're just a filthy
cannibal is what you are-

639
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,708
- this is unmotivated, Ivan.

640
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,875
I'm a vegetarian, for goodness sakes!

641
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,333
I pose nude for art,

642
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,875
not for this sick perverted idea you have.

643
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,000
- Excuse me, you pose because you're paid.

644
00:35:07,292 --> 00:35:08,167
And this is art.

645
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:09,624
Now get back on the grill.

646
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:10,667
<i>- No.</i>

647
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,458
- Would you believe this shit?

648
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,916
- She's a feisty one.

649
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:16,666
- "Ivan, I need motivation,

650
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,583
I have very high ideals,

651
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,208
and in order for me to bear
my breasts to the public,

652
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,541
I have to feel I'm making art,

653
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:29,791
because otherwise I'll just
feel like a cheap whore!"

654
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,208
- You need motivation more
than a fee we're paying you?

655
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,583
- Shut the fuck up.

656
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:37,000
Let me explain what's going on here.

657
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:39,042
See, this is a metaphor, right?

658
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,291
That maggot right there?

659
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,333
Yeah, him?

660
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,000
Big head and a skinny little body.

661
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:46,125
He's a maggot.

662
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:47,292
He's a parasite.

663
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:49,666
He feeds on people like you,

664
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,541
and that's all he does, he's
just gonna chew chew chew chew.

665
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:56,124
But you see, you're ruining
what I'm trying to do here.

666
00:35:56,417 --> 00:36:00,000
Now I'm not asking you
to fuck this monster.

667
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,667
I'm just asking you to present

668
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:05,749
your pretty pretty pink
flesh as fresh meat for him.

669
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,875
That way we get some nice,
lovely photos out of it.

670
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,083
Do you understand me?

671
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,000
Is that motivation enough for you?

672
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,958
I'll tell you, some days
it doesn't pay, right'?

673
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:20,875
Fuck.

674
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:26,041
What's up, Angela?

675
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,041
I'm in the middle of a shoot.

676
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,291
I'm okay, what's going on?

677
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:33,708
When?

678
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,250
An hour and a half from now?

679
00:36:35,542 --> 00:36:36,583
At jfk?

680
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,583
I need a hair person...

681
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,791
Okay, okay, I'll see you in Milano.

682
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:52,708
Thank you.

683
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,666
I'm off to Italy.

684
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,666
That's a wrap.

685
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:02,541
Where the fuck did you get
that model we used today?

686
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,374
- Oh, come on, you didn't
mind it when she was upstairs

687
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:05,583
with her boobs in your face-

688
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,041
- just hold the magazine and tell them

689
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,041
that that cunt is not
welcome in that studio.

690
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,416
- Okay, okay, I'll take care of it.

691
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,499
- Take the spare keys,

692
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:12,542
and I want the studio cleaned, alright,

693
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,708
it's like some misbegotten matadero.

694
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,291
- Oh yeah, you gonna pay me more for it?

695
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:17,791
- Jackie, take a hike.

696
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:18,624
- Oh...

697
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:19,667
- I love you, see you.

698
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,208
- See when you get back, bye.

699
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,333
- You look like a real killer here, kiddo.

700
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,708
You did a good job, should be proud.

701
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,250
I gotta get a fucking cab
to jfk, I'm going to Italy.

702
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:31,750
Italy, you know, like Europe.

703
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,333
You work hard, you'll get there, too.

704
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,458
You'll see.

705
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,250
You can travel and fuck
all over the planet.

706
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,625
What the fuck's the problem dude'?

707
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:45,083
You're gonna get us arrested.

708
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,750
Oh my god, here.

709
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:48,375
Put this jacket on.

710
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,333
I'm getting a whole new
wardrobe when I get to Milano.

711
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,583
You don't need the pocket square,

712
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,500
you don't have that much style.

713
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:56,500
Oh, here.

714
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,083
This is the money for the shoot.

715
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,541
Get in the cab and follow the one I take,

716
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,958
if it ever fucking gets here.

717
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,583
Always the days I gotta rush to jfk

718
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,875
that there's not a taxi
in front of the building.

719
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,208
Look at this...

720
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,083
- In the street, you know?

721
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:05,125
Walk up to somebody,
charm them a little bit.

722
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,708
You do know how to be charming, don't you?

723
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,874
- Nice apartment.

724
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,958
- It's not an apartment,
it's a photo studio.

725
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,458
- Is it yours?

726
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,541
- Of course.

727
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:32,166
I want you to pose for me,
okay, stand over there.

728
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,833
And lift your arms up.

729
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,291
I want to see your armpits, okay,

730
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:37,583
and bend forward.

731
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,625
Try to be sexy.

732
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:40,542
Sexier.

733
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,208
But act natural.

734
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,333
- If this is your place,

735
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:52,125
then you probably have a lot of money.

736
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:53,500
- Of course.

737
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:55,167
- So you will fuck?

738
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:58,791
- I want to take pictures, okay?

739
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,458
And I want you to be
quiet and pose for me.

740
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,125
Stick your ass out.

741
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,958
- Are you gonna give me more money?

742
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:06,958
- More money?

743
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,333
We haven't even talked about
how much I'm gonna give you

744
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:11,083
and you're already asking me for more'?

745
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,541
Take off your shirt first.

746
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,458
- Well, if you're getting something extra

747
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,916
than the regular John,

748
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,208
memories for you to beat off to,

749
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,541
then you've got to pay a special rate.

750
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:21,541
- Rate?

751
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:22,666
Rate'?

752
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,791
Who the fuck are you?

753
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:25,708
R...

754
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,916
I'm speechless.

755
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,624
You're talking about rate'?

756
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:33,833
You're a fucking homeless
hobo I found off the street.

757
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,083
If it wasn't for me-

758
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,250
- I'm a muse.

759
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:37,625
- You're not, okay, you're a bum.

760
00:42:37,917 --> 00:42:40,500
You'd be lying face down in your own-

761
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,042
- I wouldn't be here in
front of this thing right now

762
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,791
if I weren't a muse.

763
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,833
Do you want me to suck your cock or not?

764
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,750
I'm really good at it.

765
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,375
- You know what, this...

766
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:00,958
This is not working, okay,

767
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,375
let's go over to the fire escape,

768
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,375
pose some more over there.

769
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,708
- Then I'm putting my top back on.

770
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,541
I'm not going over there topless.

771
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:15,792
- Okay, I want you to caress yourself.

772
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:18,166
Yeah, this is turning me on.

773
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:20,374
Exactly like that.

774
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:21,292
Sexy.

775
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:25,791
Alright, now stand over in profile.

776
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:28,875
And spank yourself.

777
00:43:30,917 --> 00:43:31,917
Yeah, harder.

778
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:35,916
Perfect, perfect.

779
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:40,458
Alright, now I would like you to just

780
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,375
stick your tongue out.

781
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,000
Right, stick your tongue out and just...

782
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,833
Just keep your tongue out for me.

783
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,208
Yeah, like that.

784
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,708
Perfect, perfect.

785
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:56,000
Um, yeah, let's just...

786
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:59,708
Let's just go inside now.

787
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,625
Come on.

788
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:10,083
Wait here, I have to go to the bathroom.

789
00:44:57,042 --> 00:45:01,083
Alright, come over here,
and stop playing around.

790
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,000
Come on.

791
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,708
Alright, stand over there.

792
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,541
Over there, over there!

793
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:16,624
Now, I want to try something
new with you, okay?

794
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,583
I want you to put this bag over your head.

795
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:22,500
- What?

796
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,875
- Just put the bag over your head.

797
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,208
- You're crazy, aren't you?

798
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,666
You're some kind of sick pervert.

799
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,333
- Look, I'm paying you, aren't I?

800
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,875
So put the fucking bag
over your head, okay?

801
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,292
I'm not paying you for nothing.

802
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,708
- You're a fucking freak, you know what,

803
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,041
I think it's just a good idea
if you can give me my money

804
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,624
and I get the hell out of here.

805
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:45,458
You're like a complete idiot.

806
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,583
I didn't even want to-

807
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,125
who the hell do you think you are?

808
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:50,417
You think that I'm gonna
stick a plastic bag

809
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,083
on my fucking head?

810
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,791
- You're a fucking waste of time.

811
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,124
Don't spend it all at once.

812
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:30,417
Yeah.

813
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:33,791
Yeah, look at that.

814
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,291
You're so much more beautiful
now that you're quiet.

815
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:40,249
Yeah, not so tough now, are you bitch?

816
00:46:40,542 --> 00:46:42,458
Can't fuck up my shoot now, can you?

817
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,958
What have you got to say now?

818
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:47,458
What, what?

819
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:11,792
Fuck.

820
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,541
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

821
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,333
Shit, fuck!

822
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:18,833
Fuck!

823
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:52,958
- What can I do for you?

824
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,666
- There's something wrong with my camera.

825
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,124
I was using it yesterday,

826
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:57,792
and it takes the pictures,

827
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,541
but they all come out blurry.

828
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:00,749
See, you can't even tell

829
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:03,625
what I was taking a picture of.

830
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:06,708
I don't know, there's
something wrong with it.

831
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,208
It's not working.

832
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,124
- It's a polaroid.

833
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,708
A five year old can use this.

834
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,041
- So why wasn't it working?

835
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,750
- Try to take a picture of me.

836
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:29,667
- Qkay.

837
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,500
- Buddy...

838
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,167
You're moving the camera.

839
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,583
Now try to take another one.

840
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:45,583
Aim, take the picture,
and count to five, okay?

841
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,000
Look!

842
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:05,917
It's fine.

843
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,333
Yeah, you're perfect.

844
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:05,499
So much more beautiful
than that whore yesterday.

845
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:09,750
We're gonna take some great
pictures together, you and I.

846
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,125
- Come oh, come on, come oh!

847
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:11,166
- Are you ready to model now?

848
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:14,666
Yeah, you're so beautiful right now.

849
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:17,416
Yeah, okay, let's try something.

850
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,166
Let's try to be creative, let's try to...

851
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:24,083
Yeah, like that, yeah.

852
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,666
You're holding...

853
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:27,583
Yeah, it's like, what are you thinking?

854
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:31,250
It's like, huh,
thoughtful, but still sexy.

855
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:34,291
Let's try something else.

856
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:35,833
Scratching your head.

857
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,583
Like that, that's sexy.

858
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,166
That is very sexy.

859
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:44,083
Let's try something else.

860
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,500
You're feeling an itch,
but further down, yeah.

861
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,667
Like that, like that, that's perfect.

862
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,541
Let's see what else we can do.

863
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,333
I have an idea now.

864
00:52:57,625 --> 00:53:00,458
This is why you shouldn't be drinking,

865
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,208
because it limits your
creativity, you know?

866
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:06,958
Like, I don't drink,

867
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,250
and that's why I come up with this stuff,

868
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:11,625
this really good stuff.

869
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:12,958
So let's try...

870
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:16,708
Yeah.

871
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:19,249
That's hot.

872
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:21,500
That is really hot.

873
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,583
I wish you could see yourself right now,

874
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:25,375
you're so beautiful.

875
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:26,917
Let's try something else.

876
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,083
Twice as hot.

877
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:31,666
Perfect, perfect.

878
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,583
Perfect.

879
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:40,666
See, this is the problem.

880
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:42,666
I'm so creative, but,

881
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:46,583
sometimes there are
limits to what you can do.

882
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:04,249
- Who is there?

883
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:06,292
- I live
downstairs, you fucking retard.

884
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:07,999
My apartment is shaking!

885
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:09,375
If you don't quit jumping around,

886
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:11,875
I'm going to call the police.

887
00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:22,250
- I'm really hungry.

888
00:56:22,542 --> 00:56:24,583
You know, let me try one of these burgers.

889
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:25,750
They good?

890
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:27,333
- Yeah, yeah, they're great.

891
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,333
- Let me get one.

892
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:29,250
- Alright.

893
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,667
You see, it's the new
thing we're trying here.

894
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:05,333
We've tried to get it
as fresh as possible.

895
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,208
It's straight from the cow.

896
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,375
- Well let me ask you something,

897
00:57:08,667 --> 00:57:10,292
is it imported or American meat?

898
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:12,499
- It's 100% American.

899
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:13,750
- That's what I want to hear.

900
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:15,083
I love America.

901
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:05,792
- Albert, you're such a stallion.

902
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,374
- Thank you.

903
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,250
It's all for you.

904
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,250
The workout, the art...

905
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:15,833
Walking around taking photos in the park.

906
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,333
You inspire me to create art.

907
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:21,375
- I like it when you do things for me.

908
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,000
- You're my muse, you know.

909
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,833
I know you like my hot dogs,

910
00:58:26,125 --> 00:58:28,250
but you haven't seen anything yet.

911
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:29,500
- Oh yeah?

912
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:32,292
What are you gonna show me?

913
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:34,124
- I want to kiss you.

914
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:43,375
- Albert!

915
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:46,875
I need a place to stay.

916
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,000
- Why?

917
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,542
- Cause I got evicted,
and I don't have a job,

918
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:52,041
and I ran out of money.

919
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,249
- I think you should
get a real job like me.

920
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:55,333
- I don't want to sell hot dogs,

921
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,291
I want to be with something better.

922
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:58,833
- I'm quitting my job.

923
00:58:59,125 --> 00:59:01,250
I'm moving onto selling my photos.

924
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:02,583
- I don't believe you.

925
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:05,125
- I don't care if you believe me.

926
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,792
I could even help you get
some work if you wanted to.

927
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:09,833
- What kind of work?

928
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,916
- Do you want to model?

929
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:15,166
- Albert, I need to find
some place to stay first.

930
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,624
- You can stay in the studio where I work.

931
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:18,708
- Seriously?

932
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:21,291
Albert, if you find me a place to stay,

933
00:59:21,583 --> 00:59:23,249
I will do anything you want.

934
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:24,750
- Okay, let's go.

935
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:27,000
- Don't you want to leave your cart?

936
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:29,208
Aren't you afraid someone's
gonna steal all the hot dogs?

937
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,333
- I don't even care
about my stand anymore.

938
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,916
I'm making way too much money.

939
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:00,583
- Albert!

940
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,208
What the hell are you doing here?

941
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:03,958
- What the fuck are you doing here?

942
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,416
- What do you mean what
the fuck am I doing here?

943
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,416
I belong here, I came hereto clean up,

944
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,833
but it looks like somebody seems to have

945
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:11,500
already taken care of it.

946
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:12,708
How did you get in here?

947
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,750
- I have keys.

948
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,167
- Oh, yeah, right, from where?

949
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,666
- Ivan gave them to me.

950
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:17,666
- Bullshit!

951
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:18,874
Ivan did not give you keys.

952
01:00:19,167 --> 01:00:20,000
- Albert, maybe we should just go-

953
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:22,250
- you outta here!

954
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:23,208
Okay.

955
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,583
- Wait for me downstairs.

956
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:25,500
Okay.

957
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,791
- You are not supposed to
be here, and you know it.

958
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:32,958
This is not a place for
you to bring girls to fuck!

959
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,208
- I wanted to take photos.

960
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,625
- Oh god, that again.

961
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:41,875
You have no idea what a big
mistake you have just made.

962
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:46,041
Ivan is never gonna let you in here again.

963
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,666
- Don't tell him.

964
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:48,583
- Why not?

965
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,041
- Hey baby, I'm almost home.

966
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:52,124
How are you?

967
01:00:52,417 --> 01:00:53,583
- I'm at lvan's.

968
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,333
You are not gonna believe this.

969
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,125
- Why are you at lvan's?

970
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:59,875
- I came hereto
clean, and guess who's here?

971
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:02,250
- Jackie?

972
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:04,208
Jackie?

973
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:06,458
- Where's your friend?

974
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,250
- She's not my friend.

975
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:10,792
I told her to leave us alone.

976
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:12,583
- I didn't see her leave the building.

977
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,666
- She must have left some other way.

978
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,999
- Does she still know you're here?

979
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,583
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

980
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,958
I told her to let us work.

981
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,291
- Come on, Jackie.

982
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:31,208
Pick up.

983
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,249
- Do you think you should answer that?

984
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:34,375
- No, no no no, no.

985
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,833
That's nothing, there's
always strange people

986
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:40,875
coming through here ringing
the doorbells at all times.

987
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:42,542
- Maybe it's her?

988
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,499
- No, no, no, it's fine.

989
01:02:44,792 --> 01:02:46,042
Don't worry about it.

990
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:48,874
I'm gonna take some pictures now.

991
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,583
- Can I put this on?

992
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:01,958
- Jackie!

993
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:05,208
Jackie!

994
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:24,374
- Guess who?

995
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,791
- You look beautiful.

996
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:32,500
- Cause I was talking to my girlfriend.

997
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:33,500
- Mmm-hmm, and what happened?

998
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:34,750
- She said she was here,

999
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:36,083
but she's not picking up the phone now.

1000
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,166
- And where is she?

1001
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,916
- That's why I called.

1002
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:40,333
I don't know where she is.

1003
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,041
I called because I need you guys

1004
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,333
to find out what happened to her.

1005
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:46,833
- This is going to be real art.

1006
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:49,125
- Well, I'm ready for you, Albert.

1007
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:53,042
But only if we get
married in the pictures.

1008
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:53,958
<i>- No.</i>

1009
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,374
- Oh come on, don't be shy.

1010
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:58,833
It'll be fun.

1011
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,166
You can wear...

1012
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,500
This.

1013
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:16,958
- Hello?

1014
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,750
- This is NYPD, we have an emergency.

1015
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:21,833
We have to enter the building.

1016
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:25,708
- Okay, one
moment, I'll be right down.

1017
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,083
- Do you think your friend will let me

1018
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:29,250
keep some of her clothes?

1019
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:34,166
Oh, Albert, you look so cute.

1020
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:36,583
- Thank you.

1021
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,041
Now let's take some pictures.

1022
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,916
- Okay, what do you want me to do?

1023
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:42,749
- Over there, please.

1024
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:43,667
Okay.

1025
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,083
This good?

1026
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:48,083
- Yeah.

1027
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:50,041
Alright, now I want you to imagine

1028
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:51,208
that you're a lioness in the Savanna.

1029
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,666
Okay?

1030
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,791
You are hunting for your prey.

1031
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,208
- I'm hunting, okay.

1032
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,916
- You're the queen of Africa,
okay, you're a predator.

1033
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:02,374
You're just moving around
silently in the bushes,

1034
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,833
waiting to strike, waiting to jump

1035
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:08,583
onto your unsuspected
victim, this antelope.

1036
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:10,500
Okay.

1037
01:05:10,792 --> 01:05:13,250
- Okay, beautiful, just like that.

1038
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,000
I want you to model with your eyes.

1039
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,625
The predatory eyes.

1040
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:19,042
Yeah, beautiful.

1041
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,166
Just like that.

1042
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,750
- What's your name?

1043
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:38,750
- Tony-

1044
01:05:39,042 --> 01:05:39,583
- Tony-

1045
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:40,500
okay.

1046
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,458
Yo, Ivan?

1047
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:52,958
Ivan, it's Tony.

1048
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:01,333
Hey man, it's Tony, I live downstairs.

1049
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,000
Everything okay in there, Ivan?

1050
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,458
- I'm busy working!

1051
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,375
Go away!

1052
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:22,833
Okay, this time, you're in a sun chair.

1053
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:23,666
Okay.

1054
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,874
- Okay, it's warming your skin,

1055
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,625
making it bronzed and beautiful.

1056
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,708
Can you feel the sun on your skin?

1057
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,375
It's like paradise for you.

1058
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:35,792
Imagine that.

1059
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,874
Perfect, like that.

1060
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:39,375
Oh, but what's happening now?

1061
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:40,292
The rain.

1062
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,458
But it's gentle drizzle,

1063
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:47,541
but it makes your skin
feel sensationally soft.

1064
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,624
Enjoy it, you're enjoying this.

1065
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,542
It's cooling you down.

1066
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:56,125
Yeah, beautiful, just like that.

1067
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,124
And then you get up.

1068
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:10,042
Get up.

1069
01:07:12,458 --> 01:07:14,791
And taste the rain, taste it.

1070
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:17,292
Taste it.

1071
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,416
Yes, yes, exactly like that.

1072
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,291
You want to really experience it

1073
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:27,374
in a way you've never
experienced it before.

1074
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:30,083
You start to dance around in the rain.

1075
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:32,416
You're making this, cause this is like,

1076
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:35,499
it's a tribute to the rain.

1077
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:36,500
Okay, yeah.

1078
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:40,583
This is the rain dance.

1079
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:41,916
This is...

1080
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:44,041
Yes, yes, just like that.

1081
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:46,124
Just like that, perfect.

1082
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,124
Alright, now...

1083
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:53,792
I would like you...

1084
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:59,042
To put this bag over your head.

1085
01:07:59,333 --> 01:07:59,958
Okay.

1086
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:06,958
Okay.

1087
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,958
- Alright, perfect.

1088
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,791
Okay, I would like you to imagine

1089
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,250
that you're being asphyxiated.

1090
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:18,375
Somebody's trying to kill you.

1091
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:19,833
You can't breathe.

1092
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:21,166
You're struggling.

1093
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:25,083
You're struggling against
this unknown killer.

1094
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:34,625
You're fighting for every breath of air.

1095
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:38,083
Just like that.

1096
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:42,749
You like it'?

1097
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:48,250
It's like an aphrodisiac.

1098
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,833
Yeah, just like that, exactly.

1099
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:59,292
- This is actually kind of cool.

1100
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:06,667
Kiss me, Albert.

1101
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:13,333
Albert.

1102
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:18,708
(Gunshob

1103
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,250
- Albert.

1104
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,000
Albert, Albert, Albert.

1105
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,583
Your life cut short.

1106
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:21,416
Gone too soon.

1107
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:27,250
We were such good friends.

1108
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:30,791
I had so many plans for us.

1109
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:36,708
- Why?

1110
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,500
- Why indeed.

1111
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,416
Man's eternal question.

1112
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:48,708
Are you part of his family?

1113
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:50,958
- Uh, no.

1114
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,625
I was with him when he got shot.

1115
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:59,041
- In my studio?

1116
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:06,167
- I had nowhere to go.

1117
01:12:07,125 --> 01:12:10,208
Albert said I could stay there.

1118
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,916
- He was so generous, wasn't he?

1119
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:15,249
Such a kind, generous soul.

1120
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:22,208
That's a terrible picture of him, though.

1121
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,708
I didn't take it.

1122
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:31,375
He was a lot better looking
in real life, wasn't he?

1123
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:37,542
So...

1124
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,208
Where are you going after this?

1125
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:48,417
- I don't have anywhere to go.

1126
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:51,999
- Well, I'd be honored to give you a lift.

1127
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,958
My chauffer is waiting outside.

1128
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:03,749
But I need some time with Albert.

1129
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,416
A moment, just to say goodbye.

1130
01:13:10,542 --> 01:13:11,458
- Of course.

1131
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:19,499
Bye, Albert.

1132
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,749
- You son of a bitch.

1133
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:46,583
Do you know the trouble you've caused me'?

1134
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,750
The havoc you've wreaked?

1135
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,083
I can't get insured.

1136
01:13:53,667 --> 01:13:56,292
And you fucking killed Jackie!

1137
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:57,499
Jackie!

1138
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:58,917
She was so dear to me!

1139
01:13:59,208 --> 01:13:59,833
Oh my god.

1140
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:02,625
Do you know what it's gonna be

1141
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:05,833
to try to find a makeup
artist of her caliber again?

1142
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:09,250
You couldn't have knocked off Nancy?

1143
01:14:09,542 --> 01:14:11,583
You little ungrateful worm.

1144
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:15,583
After all I did for you.

1145
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:19,416
You're gonna pay for this.

1146
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:21,666
You're gonna pay for this.

1147
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,458
You'll live on through my art.
