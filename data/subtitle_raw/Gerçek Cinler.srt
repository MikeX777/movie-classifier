1
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:34,950
The disturbing images and speeches in this
film were broadcast uncensored. So it is not suitable for children.

2
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:38,494
- Come on, we need to shoot!

3
00:00:38,494 --> 00:00:41,813
- I want to stay a little behind...

4
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:43,547
- Give me the camera so I'll shoot

5
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:44,047
- No no! You go...

6
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:49,367
-Slowly Ceyhun...

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,400
- Slowly please

8
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:08,192
- The sound is coming from somewhere around here.

9
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:09,665
- There is a sound! There is a sound!

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,783
- Fuck your mother!

11
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,206
- Ceyhun, this has gotten out of hand. I'm not in anymore! I turn off the camera.

12
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:54,083
- Hello, I'm Ceyhun. Actually, it was as if I was greeting myself. Because I will not post this video. This will be my digital diary.

13
00:01:55,487 --> 00:02:01,828
- I will do a research for my master thesis. And that research will usually consist of videos.

14
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:10,510
- Some parts will also consist of video and audio recordings in this way. Maybe I can add some of these videos to my thesis.

15
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:14,032
- But mostly these videos will stay with me.

16
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:21,943
- What will my thesis be about? My thesis is about social fears and myths.

17
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:33,671
- I am investigating the effect of paranormal events that some people believe in, on people who do not believe in paranormal events.

18
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:40,409
-I will also do research on what looks like paranormal phenomena.

19
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:50,692
- Unfortunately, it will not be a very unbiased study. because I don't believe in such things and I know that they all have a scientific explanation.

20
00:02:51,543 --> 00:03:01,296
- I want to reveal which scientific situation people think of as a paranormal event.

21
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:08,778
- I did some research on this subject. I found places on the internet that said don't go here.

22
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:18,185
- I want to ask questions and interview the people living there about why we shouldn't go in here.

23
00:03:18,185 --> 00:03:21,319
- For these interviews, two of my classmates will help me.

24
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:34,854
- Murat will shoot with the camera. Kuzey will also help me with interviews.

25
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:41,022
- In my internet research, I discovered a village called ILICA with terrible rumors and the nearby woodland.

26
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:43,430
- No one can go out after dark!

27
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,403
- I'm going to go there and talk to the people who live there.

28
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:48,509
- ( The village has been raided by jinns! )

29
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:51,496
- I will ask why and why they are afraid.

30
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:58,170
- Rumors have it that voices are heard, shadows roam and lights are seen from the wooded area at night.

31
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:08,265
- The interesting thing is that people who have never been there also believe these rumors.

32
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,125
- In fact, this is the main point I want to focus on!

33
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:19,691
- Because if people psychologically believe in paranormal events, they believe the rumors containing this belief more quickly.

34
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:26,479
- In this way, people become selective in perception. And they perceive many things as real.

35
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,930
- That's why they think the rumors in this village are true.

36
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,922
- This will be the case I will approach first in my research.

37
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:45,417
- Secondly, there are scientific studies showing that some electromagnetic perturbations show such hallucinations.

38
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:51,842
- Magnetic waves delivered to the forebrain can cause hallucinations.

39
00:04:51,842 --> 00:05:02,413
- We know that some sound frequencies that humans cannot hear trigger hallucinations.

40
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:07,154
- Some chemicals may be intense in the area we are researching.

41
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:14,023
-there may be carbon monoxide or formaldehyde in that area.
These can also cause hallucinations.

42
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:25,734
- In the regions where these paranormal events take place, such things can happen frequently.

43
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:30,857
- I don't have the technical equipment to measure them. So I'll just try to find visual evidence.

44
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:36,146
- I think a shadow or sound seen there must have misled and frightened people.

45
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:44,293
- To reveal the truth, I will stay overnight with my friends in the forbidden area. And we will record what we see there with the camera.

46
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:51,108
- While researching on the internet, I learned that a horror movie was shot in that feared area.

47
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:55,935
- And I watched this movie (The Torment of Jin). I even talked to Onur AldoÄŸan, the director of this movie.

48
00:05:55,935 --> 00:05:59,457
- The director did a lot more research on this scary area than I did before making the movie.

49
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:07,250
- We talked about whether strange events happened during the filming.

50
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:23,628
- The people living there. They didn't want a movie to be made. They were afraid that they would awaken evil.

51
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:35,938
-According to what his director told us, the film crew was also impressed by what was said and began to fear even the smallest sounds in the forest.

52
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:44,531
- Anyway, I will not be able to shoot as professionally as that director. I'll just record what's going on with a camera and try to arouse curiosity.

53
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:52,099
- Sometimes I will interview the villagers and the people living there. Of course, if they accept it.

54
00:06:52,780 --> 00:07:11,639
- I'm ending my first shoot here. My friend Murat will record the next on video. And if you're ready, now I'm showing you my home situation behind the scenes. :)

55
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:22,151
- Yes, friends, I started recording the camera.
- We're close already. What is this? Suddenly there was fog.

56
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:28,459
- You have to be crazy to come here.

57
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:35,547
- We're cultured people, but look at the bullshit we've come and researched.

58
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:43,752
- Ceyhun, can I tell you something?
- Of course
- If you hadn't helped me earlier, I wouldn't have come here for you alive.  :)

59
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:45,272
- Everything is mutual.

60
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:46,822
- He brought me by force.

61
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:50,066
- Tell the truth, did Ceyhun pay you to come here?

62
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,714
- Of course, I will ask Ceyhun a small fee in return for my coming here. :)

63
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:54,869
- Can you look at the navigation? Are we here?

64
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:59,511
-The navigation doesn't show them. We will find out by asking.

65
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:03,075
- Only if you are aware there is no one...

66
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:07,562
- There really is no one to ask directions.

67
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:12,872
- Could it be because of those dogs? I'll close the windows so they don't jump in.

68
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:14,975
- Dogs do nothing.

69
00:08:17,273 --> 00:08:25,827
- Sorry, there is a forested area around here, do you know where it is? :)

70
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:28,622
- The dog could have spoken and said we don't like strangers here. I expected this.

71
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:44,787
- Let's find someone around here and ask the way. The glass fogged up and it bothered me.

72
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:56,090
- Turn on the car air conditioner.
- It's on, but it doesn't work.
- Wait a minute, someone is sitting in the garden. Let me ask them.

73
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:06,237
- Hello. We were going to go into the forest, but which way should we go?

74
00:09:06,237 --> 00:09:08,472
- What will you do in the forest?

75
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:11,895
- We need to shoot a video for my thesis.

76
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:18,595
- You have to go that way, but what kind of thesis is that? What will you do there?

77
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:27,185
- I am preparing a psychological thesis. There was a forest here and people were afraid of the rumors. I will research this for my thesis.

78
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:33,179
- Nonsense. It means that these stories have reached universities. There is nothing there. They are afraid of false stories that were made up fifty years ago.

79
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:40,516
- The people living here made up scary stories so that the young people wouldn't go to the woods to have sex, drink alcohol or use drugs.

80
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:51,625
- In fact, we came here to investigate where and how exactly what you are talking about originated.

81
00:09:51,625 --> 00:10:09,254
-  The people living here made up such horrible stories so that foreign people and young people would not go there and do things against the rules because the forest area is a bit desolate. In short, all the stories told are lies.

82
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:15,814
- Then there is nothing there?
- I'm telling you. There is nothing there!

83
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:25,308
- We went in search of adventure when we were younger. But don't worry there is nothing.

84
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:35,853
- Do not go in vain for research. The phone doesn't even pick up there anyway. You get lost. Pig, wolf, dog everything is there. You're afraid dude.

85
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:42,488
- Then you come too.
- Ok but what are you going to do to be right there?

86
00:10:42,488 --> 00:10:54,215
-  We will only shoot a video, but we want to spend the night there.
- Forget about me, there is Ã–zgÃ¼r here, he knows the place well and can guide you if you want ?

87
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:57,906
- Let's go ahead, we'll ask for your help if needed. Can we find you here?

88
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:05,686
- Okay, so it's okay to bother to interview you when we're done?
- Okey okey.

89
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:09,671
- Of course, when you come, we'll have coffee together.

90
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,750
- This shop is closed but I guess you are sitting inside?

91
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,225
- Yes, we turn off the lights and sit in front of the door with friends.

92
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:19,766
- Let me ask you something, we didn't see anyone on the way on our way. I wonder why?

93
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:27,130
- In this town, after a certain time, everyone goes home, it's not too soon.

94
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,460
- We were surprised that it was too early.

95
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:43,508
- Don't think of this place like city centers. Here, everyone goes home at a certain time and spends time at home. There's nothing to do anyway.

96
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,671
- We understand. Thank you so much.

97
00:11:45,671 --> 00:12:03,400
- Come back from here now. You will go for about a kilometer. There you will see the sign. Go inside from there. But as I said, the phone does not pick up. Let your parents know if they're curious. :)

98
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,607
- Okay. Thank you so much dude.

99
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:14,649
- There's definitely a dope party in the forrest! :)
- How much the man likes to talk... Our heads are swollen! :)

100
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,724
- It's your fault. You asked so many questions and you didn't stop. :)

101
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:25,359
- How do I know that the man will talk so much? He kept talking! Like the mayor of this town!  It's like the man forced everyone into their homes. And he's sitting alone in front of his shop, mentally ill.  :)

102
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:37,820
- I think all the villagers are drinking in the forest. :)
-  I think everyone is avoiding this guy. :) If you ask me, why are people so scared in this town? I would point this guy out as an answer. :)

103
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,868
- Are there too many dogs? interesting...

104
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:52,374
- I am ready
- is this here?
- I don't know, you have to ask Ceyhun.

105
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,260
- Yes here. Did you get your flashlight?

106
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,263
- What is this place?

107
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,431
- Yes welcome to my channel.
- Don't be fooled, let's shoot a video and go.

108
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:06,551
-You are right, the university committee will examine it.

109
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:16,450
- We came to the village where the famous horror events took place.

110
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,640
- It would be cooler if you turned on your flashlights.
- I didn't turn it on so that the light wouldn't reflect on the camera.

111
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,594
- Okay, done. Hold it left and right so I can adjust.

112
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:27,882
-  There are some things that people who live here are afraid of!

113
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:34,201
- If you make fun of it like that, we're going to have to cut this footage. You can't give these video recordings to the committee.

114
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,909
- Let's see what people are afraid of, we wanted to see. We will spend a night here.

115
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,985
- The cameras will be with us. Since the invention of the camera, such supernatural phenomena have not been seen very often.

116
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:50,695
- Let's see if we can capture supernatural events with our cameras. We will spend a night here...

117
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,153
- Only dog â€‹â€‹barking sounds in the distance

118
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:55,500
- I hope it's just a dog...

119
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,000
- All I want right now is that the dogs don't bite us.
- Lets go...

120
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,098
- There are just too many bugs around. One of them just landed on my head.

121
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:06,501
- This stick won't work against the insect, but still, let's have it with us.

122
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,292
- We forgot to take the insecticide.

123
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,466
- Ok.

124
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,649
- Does the camera keep recording?
- Yes.

125
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,021
- Then I'll turn on the flashlight again.

126
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,368
- We rely on pesticides and look for jin. :)

127
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:40,160
- In ancient European and Christian stories, they used to scare vampires with garlic. We also use insecticide for Jinns.  :)

128
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,441
- It's like there's a road there...

129
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:51,287
- Are you sure it's the road?
- I am not. so let's follow.

130
00:14:52,904 --> 00:14:57,627
- They entered the mysterious path.
- Here you go...

131
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:07,649
- Guys, let's move slowly, because I carry both a camera and a light.

132
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,856
- Ceyhun, you can't pay for my effort just by buying me a meal. :)

133
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:22,693
- Doesn't it mean anything to you that your friend got high marks and completed his thesis?

134
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:26,606
- Yeah it doesn't mean anything to me I came here for the food you're going to treat me :)

135
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:32,769
- I need to give a nice speech about why we're here. Let's find a better and free space for this above.

136
00:15:35,197 --> 00:15:40,000
- Have you been up before?
- No, it's my first time here with you.

137
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:48,183
- Ceyhun; Wherever there is nonsense you find and you always bring us after you.

138
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:55,657
- But rumor has it we came, you know...

139
00:15:55,657 --> 00:16:04,595
- And here we uncovered the lies. Didn't people come here? Look, people come and sit and hang out.

140
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:09,907
- Look, they lit a fire over there, too.

141
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:12,715
- They obviously made up stories so that other people wouldn't come.

142
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:15,558
- They do not want this place where they are comfortable to be known.

143
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,522
- If it were me, I would make up stories and not want to be disturbed.

144
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,000
- Let's find a nice background to shoot.

145
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,411
- Can you point the flashlight over there? The woodland goes quite down and forward... It looks mysterious.

146
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,222
- Yeah nice... You can come with your girlfriend. :)

147
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:35,237
- An elite venue :)

148
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:37,104
- Make your first date with your girlfriends here. :)

149
00:16:38,977 --> 00:16:47,222
- Yes, we came here, but what are we going to shoot? I know you called me just because I can use the camera.

150
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,106
- Ceyhun called you because you could use the camera, but I don't understand why he called me. :)

151
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,683
- I wanted to take advantage of your muscle strength. :)

152
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:55,419
- If I didn't have a camera, I wouldn't be here either. :)

153
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:02,696
- Let's start like this... First of all, let me put that stick down.
- Why did you take the stick anyway?

154
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:06,921
- Just in case. We are in the forest area, I wanted to take precautions. You come before me now and shine a light on me. I will talk to the camera.

155
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:11,932
- But you don't get into the frame, let the camera only record me.

156
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:17,091
- Hold light on your face. Keep the light in the background. I will shoot with my own camera light.

157
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,256
- As a matter of fact, it will be much better if you turn off the lights.

158
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:25,834
- three, two, one recording...

159
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:34,821
- Hello, I'm Ceyhun. We are in IlÄ±caklar village. It's now 02:22 am

160
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:45,297
- People are very afraid to come here because of the terrible rumors in this village.

161
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:54,374
- My research focus is to capture images of how these stories affect people.

162
00:17:54,374 --> 00:18:00,282
- I know there is nothing to be afraid of here. But still, I've come to understand why people are so afraid of it.

163
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:04,732
- Three friends are going to spend the night here.

164
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:19,063
- Let's see what will happen to us. We will try to understand what are the events that affect the villagers in their daily lives.

165
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:29,261
- Later in this video, we will have discussions and comments on this subject.

166
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:38,650
- what are you doing? This video will be given to the university committee.
- Nothing happens, you cut the video from here.
- Well, your voice and image overlapped.

167
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:46,989
- Do you realize that you did something very stupid? Bad things have already started to happen to us, thanks to you.

168
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:49,744
- That's what the villagers are afraid of. :)

169
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:56,994
- You're the fat and bespectacled you of our bro team. That's why you should be afraid first. :)
- So am I going to die first? :)

170
00:18:56,994 --> 00:19:02,064
- Where are we going, what are we doing bro
- What do we know. Let's go wherever we're going.

171
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:08,106
- I think we should go this way. Maybe we can see something.

172
00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:15,397
- Should we lie and pretend we saw something and were scared? :)

173
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:16,861
- I think what I just did will work very well for this issue.

174
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:22,776
- If we add that nonsense you do to the video and present it as a thesis, you will be famous.

175
00:19:24,649 --> 00:19:36,789
- I think I'll take you on video from the front. Keep the lanterns on. It gets more scary and cinematic.

176
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,707
- So where are the Jins?

177
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:51,871
- You've become like ghostbusters, it's ridiculous that we're here anyway...

178
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:13,134
- By the way, do you remember which way we came?
- I remember.

179
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:16,800
- Don't do silly things.

180
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,400
- I regret bringing you here.

181
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:25,523
- Don't touch! it's the holy stone!
- Okay, that's enough, don't make fun of it, we already know that there is nothing and everything is a lie.

182
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:29,886
- You must also respect the fears of the villagers.

183
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:33,830
- What will it gain us if I respect that?

184
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,904
- Our purpose here is to understand why they are afraid anyway. Let us do our job.

185
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:43,262
- I think it's all nonsense!

186
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:49,717
- Why did you choose such a stupid topic for your thesis?

187
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:51,807
- Unfortunately, only these topics remained for the thesis.

188
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:59,002
- What kind of a thesis teacher do you have, he asks you for such a ridiculous subject.

189
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:04,422
- In fact, the subject of my thesis; about fears and their effects on everyday life. I changed the subject a little more to make it interesting.

190
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:07,125
- So you came up with this nonsense topic...

191
00:21:09,508 --> 00:21:12,093
- The moon is beautiful.

192
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:15,504
- I think you are trying to turn the video into a romantic movie.

193
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:21,600
- Actually, what we're looking for here right now is a sound, a shadow, a movement...

194
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:28,126
- Because people are more prone to be afraid of things they can't make sense of.

195
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:39,401
- The minds try to complete the things that people cannot make sense of with the things they see.

196
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:42,130
- What are you doing bro?

197
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,706
- You continue.

198
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:47,111
- How can we go on so you can be serious?

199
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:48,775
- Ok, don't worry, you record video from the beginning.

200
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:51,283
- I'm already being silly. I don't even know what I'm saying.

201
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:56,020
- Anyway, we'll collect them later in the interview section. I'm going to make something up now.

202
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:02,223
- Can you get out of the frame, let me talk alone.

203
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:08,935
- What we are looking for is a voice, a shadow, or an illusion. Let's see what the villagers are afraid of.

204
00:22:10,978 --> 00:22:14,395
- One minute, there was a sound.
- Where from?

205
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,769
- Did you see it too?

206
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:23,978
- Is it a dog?
- Something has escaped. I couldn't understand what was running away.

207
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:27,870
- Wait a minute. The camera was recording. Let's watch the footage.

208
00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:34,200
- You saw it! just like a human...

209
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,442
- No... It is the shadow reflected from the tree.

210
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:43,360
- Look, when you hit the light of the lantern from this angle, doesn't it reflect like a human shadow?

211
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,489
- Look, that's what it looks like when reflected from here.
- Ceyhun! Guys, don't talk nonsense! Don't shout, be quiet. That thing was just like a human...

212
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,877
- I think it was the shadow...

213
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:56,324
- After all, who will be here at night but us?

214
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:59,782
- If you're here, there may be others.

215
00:22:59,782 --> 00:23:01,823
- Well, if there is someone, why run away?

216
00:23:01,823 --> 00:23:06,050
- Okay, there was someone and he ran away.

217
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,280
- And if you look where to go, there is no way.
- Right...

218
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:14,125
- But you saw it and heard the sound it made while running. What was that thing?

219
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:18,137
- Maybe it was an animal...

220
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:22,026
- Ceyhun, keep the flashlight forward, quick.

221
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,598
- Dude, look like there's someone there.

222
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,333
- Where?

223
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:35,949
- Shall we turn off the lights?
- No, then we can't see anything.

224
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:39,721
- Hello?

225
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:44,270
- It could be the villagers.

226
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:45,742
- Hello?

227
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:49,890
- I just heard a gunshot coming from far away.

228
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:57,156
- It's a tree branch!
- I almost pissed myself out of fear.
- It's a tree branch!

229
00:23:57,156 --> 00:24:01,983
- No, what we saw was not a tree branch. Let's take another look at the video we took.

230
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,685
- We shoot video in the dark. Shadows can look like many things.

231
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:10,477
- Ok, I kept quiet... When we get home, we'll see it on the big screen. But I'm still a little scared.

232
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,955
- It was a tree branch.
- Damn it, everything we see is a tree branch?

233
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:26,044
- Look then. The shadow of Kuzeys hand also looks like something.
- Nonsense...

234
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:32,785
- We started the video shoot with the subject of why the villagers are afraid. But we started to fear everything. Actually, as a thesis, it is enough to give the videos that we shot...

235
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:40,903
- In my opinion, give what we shot on this video as a thesis. We were afraid, you say why the villagers should not be afraid. Let's finish tonight, let's finish shooting.

236
00:24:40,903 --> 00:24:44,945
- What happened now? Are you scared?
- Yes what happend?

237
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:47,277
- Did you understand that?

238
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,954
- There's a big difference between what you are in the car and what you are now. You're scared.

239
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:52,673
- What does it matter?

240
00:24:53,099 --> 00:25:01,044
- Look, do you see? Are you scared or not? We can all get scared for a moment.

241
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:07,202
- Bro, I'm telling you again. In the footage we captured on camera, a man is running away.

242
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:10,995
- OK, I saw it too. If it already exists, I think it will appear soon.

243
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:15,593
- Could it be an animal?
- Will it be an animal? He was like a human.

244
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:19,678
- Ceyhun! Ceyhun! Stop! The fire is burning ahead.

245
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:23,919
- Calm down, you scared me.
- Okay, that's the guy who ran away from us, that's the one who lit the fire.

246
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,695
- Is there someone by the fire?
- Yes yes there is someone there! hold the light. Look dude! There is someone!

247
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:33,249
- Don't shine a light on the man, let's go and talk.

248
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:40,523
- Shall we not disturb?
- We have already come to the man... Sorry?

249
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,475
- Dressed in black. whoa!

250
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:45,109
- What is he doing there?

251
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,236
- Dude what is this?
- Hello there?

252
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:54,499
- Human, of course. What else?
- Ceyhun, stop, don't go!

253
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,622
- Hello?

254
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,737
- Fuck! Fuck!

255
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:02,491
- Fuck!

256
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:05,073
- Kuzey! Stop stop! Stop!

257
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:07,510
- Sprained my foot! Sprained my foot

258
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,576
-Fuck! fuck!  Stop! Stop!
- Did you see?

259
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,804
- I saw, I saw!
- Let's go to the car!

260
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:17,986
- Stop bro! I recorded it on camera.

261
00:26:18,837 --> 00:26:22,909
- Which way?
- Please let's go to the car! Where is the car?

262
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:29,280
- OK, turn off the camera.
- Wait bro, I think I injured my foot.

263
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:36,650
- Please let's go to the car!
- Where is the car?

264
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:38,240
- Are your feet okay?

265
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,355
- My foot looks fine

266
00:26:40,355 --> 00:26:43,393
- Where did we come from? Where did we come from bro?

267
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:47,978
- Phone not picking up? Let's take a look at the map, shall we?

268
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:52,513
- Phone line not working...
- No signal?
- No signal...

269
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:56,865
- Lets go...
- Dude one minute... I heard a voice...

270
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,637
- I swear I heard a voice.

271
00:26:58,637 --> 00:27:00,717
- Where did that sound come from?

272
00:27:00,717 --> 00:27:04,054
- The sound came from nearby...

273
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:28,784
- I've been like this for two weeks.

274
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:34,775
- I was startled by every sound and everything.

275
00:27:36,477 --> 00:27:41,490
- I can only sleep for 1 hour a day. Waking up from time to time of course...

276
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:51,451
- I don't know what I'm seeing... But on the other hand, I'm aware of what I'm seeing.

277
00:27:53,749 --> 00:28:02,397
- Actually, I've been trying to prepare this video for two weeks, but I couldn't talk, I couldn't get my head together...

278
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:05,826
- I want to try one more time.

279
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,307
- I've been researching like crazy... I'm trying to find out what we're going through.

280
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:17,983
- We reached the car that night...

281
00:28:17,983 --> 00:28:20,069
- Murat sprained his ankle.

282
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:27,899
- We saw that thing again several times with the camera off.

283
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:30,498
- We still couldn't figure out what that thing was...

284
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:33,165
- That thing's body looked human, but I couldn't see its face clearly...

285
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:41,266
- There was something like black cloth that he draped over it...  But I couldn't understand what it was.

286
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:47,630
- That thing's face looked human-like, but more brightly wounded...

287
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,274
- It was as if his skin was torn and shedding ...

288
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:54,770
- its eyes were very bright, not exactly like human eyes...

289
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,023
- It was like it was on fire...

290
00:28:57,832 --> 00:29:04,366
- I couldn't quite see the mouth of that thing, but it was like smokeless fire...

291
00:29:06,196 --> 00:29:14,507
- Unfortunately, because we escaped, when we look at the videos we shot that night, we can see that thing for a very short time...

292
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:21,188
- I actually went there to videotape it, but without success.

293
00:29:23,827 --> 00:29:26,991
- After what happened...

294
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:37,720
- After that incident, I got discouraged and even thought of canceling my thesis altogether. But I will not cancel. Because I have reasons...

295
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,029
- My friend Kuzey insisted that I finish this thesis and even stopped meeting with me...

296
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,883
- He said he was going to see a psychologist...

297
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:54,044
- Now he won't answer my phones either.

298
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:58,718
- We researched a little more with Murat.

299
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:05,412
- I told my wife what had happened and she didn't believe me.

300
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,080
- And I was in a situation like this...

301
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:19,196
- I can't make people believe me because of what I've seen. Everyone treats me just like I was before I started my thesis.

302
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:26,192
- In short, I became like the people on the subjects in my thesis.

303
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:32,530
- I really think that what I saw is not real, but there are camera recordings and two more of my friends saw it with me!

304
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,133
- Like I said, all three of us saw the same thing there.

305
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:44,621
- We talked about if we all saw the same thing. We opened the images and yes what we saw was that horrible thing...

306
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:56,480
- I've been watching and researching these images like crazy over and over again... But everything shows the same thing...

307
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,663
- People told me...

308
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:09,199
- People told me if you're scared, go to the police. They said someone scared you or made a joke.

309
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:12,934
- Honestly, I've considered all these possibilities.

310
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:23,542
- I wondered if the villagers, who didn't want us to go there, played this game to scare us. But what I saw was something else, I know that!

311
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:29,235
- If it's the villagers who scare us, I really congratulate you, it's a great plan... They managed to scare us.

312
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:37,386
- But the thing there was moving very fastâ€¦ One moment it was there, the next it was here.

313
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,234
- And that's in the footage.

314
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:46,672
- I'm trying to stop those moments especially on the computer.

315
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:51,005
- But it doesn't look very clear in the videos because it moves so fast.

316
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:58,765
- Maybe you'll call me retarded, but I want to take another shot! Because I'm obsessed with this situation!

317
00:31:58,765 --> 00:32:09,682
- I don't want to call that thing Jin like the villagers. But they say there are Jins out there.

318
00:32:09,682 --> 00:32:20,729
- I'm going to call that thing Jin for now. But I believe that thing there is not from this dimension.

319
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:32,793
- Why is this creature in that area? Is a dimensional door opening and appearing? Why did it appear to us? I have thousands of questions in my mind.

320
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:35,195
- And I don't want to leave the questions behind.

321
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:41,083
- Of course, people call me stupid because of this thought...

322
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:50,000
- What can I do when I go to the police station? Are the cops going to arrest something they haven't seen?

323
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,106
- It's no use calling the cops!

324
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,931
- They think I'm crazy...

325
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:58,647
- I showed the videos to a few people and they said it's not real.

326
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:05,884
- Some youtubers wanted to buy my video. They thought they could make good money out of it.

327
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:09,108
- No one took it seriously except youtubers.

328
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:27,448
- I am 30 years old and because of this event that I saw 2 weeks ago, I started to question my whole belief system. I started believing in something I didn't believe in. This is exactly what I want to go after.

329
00:33:30,768 --> 00:33:38,133
- No one believes me when I tell or show images. I want to find images that they can believe in.

330
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:40,642
- Because I didn't believe anyone either.

331
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,369
- Now it's the other way around and no one believes me. This bothers me a lot.

332
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:48,041
- Kuzey is gone.

333
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:51,972
- We went to an imam with Murat...

334
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:55,578
- My relationship with my wife is not good right now...

335
00:33:55,578 --> 00:34:00,593
- It bothered me a lot that my wife didn't believe me.

336
00:34:00,593 --> 00:34:03,596
- It bothered me a lot that she thought I was crazy.

337
00:34:03,596 --> 00:34:09,233
- We're staying in separate places now and won't be seeing each other for a while.

338
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:14,168
- I'll talk to her again after I clear my head

339
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:21,644
- It bothered me a lot that she didn't believe me and left the house...

340
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:30,304
- I'm gonna videotape that creature. I'll make my wife and everyone else believe me...

341
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:44,344
- I keep researching like crazy.

342
00:34:44,344 --> 00:34:52,954
- I reached out to someone else who saw that creature in the same area. I even noticed something interesting, let me show you that.

343
00:34:52,954 --> 00:35:03,594
- This video was shot at the same place. He says he saw the creature I was running from.

344
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:17,050
- I've seen something like this over there that goes by so fast.

345
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:22,582
- The creature I saw there is very similar to the creatures in this video and photographs.

346
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:30,740
- I've seen images like this on the internet before, but it's interesting how similar they are to what I saw.

347
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,673
- Both of these images were taken at the same location as mine.

348
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:40,526
- I contacted the owner of these images.

349
00:35:40,526 --> 00:35:47,967
- I invited her to do my research, but he said she didn't want to be involved.

350
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:57,981
- I'm investigating for another place right now. I will make a separate video about it later.

351
00:36:02,365 --> 00:36:10,000
- I found another interesting story around Kocaeli.

352
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:15,250
- I'm startled by every sound now.

353
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:23,351
- There was a house in this village. But the interesting thing is that nobody wants to tell this story.

354
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:30,676
- Everyone knew the other stories and they were very popular.

355
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:35,870
- But they don't want to talk about this story. I just learned that there is a terrible house in that village.

356
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,173
- And I learned that that house has been empty for 50-60 years.

357
00:36:37,173 --> 00:36:42,387
- I know something bad happened to the family that lived there, but I never found out what it was.

358
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:47,811
- I was able to reach someone who knows about these places through a friend of mine.

359
00:36:47,811 --> 00:36:58,110
- When I asked about the story in that house, he certainly did not want to tell. I said why I was researching this, I told what I had been through.

360
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:06,760
- Then I offered some money. It was very difficult to convince. He said he would take me all the way to the house, that he would not interfere with anything and that I should not enter the house.

361
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:13,601
- I think they have invaded the house. And these jins are also haunting those who enter the house.

362
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:19,924
- I've been searching like crazy for these things I've seen and...

363
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,802
- I think if these jins were going to hurt us, they would have hurt us in the forest anyway.

364
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:33,322
- They have not harmed us and I have good intentions towards them. I will not disturb them.

365
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:45,047
- My aim is to announce it to the world with all the evidence if they are real.

366
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:49,206
- Before we go to that village and home, we will meet with a hodja.

367
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:52,089
- We'll set off in the morning...

368
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:54,344
- Let's see what happens...

369
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:35,871
- Ceyhun, we came this far with your word, but I'm afraid.

370
00:38:35,871 --> 00:38:37,927
- I'm also very afraid.

371
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:44,615
- I do not think that the amulet written by Hodja will protect me.

372
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,614
- But our intentions are not bad...

373
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,614
- No wait a minute!

374
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:57,192
- No, I don't trust our good intentions! What if the jins we meet are malicious?

375
00:38:57,192 --> 00:39:01,139
- In short, let's not bother those jins too much.

376
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:12,595
- I think the same as you. I just want people to see these jins if they exist. Because I know very well what I saw.

377
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:19,809
- By the way, navigation led us here. If you see someone on the side of the road, let's stop. Look carefully.

378
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:22,634
- I think we are in a close place, but there is not much internet around here.

379
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:27,104
- Someone is sitting over there. If we can't find it, we'll ask. Let's go a little further. I think there's a sign over there.

380
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:35,865
- By the way, navigation led us here. If you see someone on the side of the road, let's stop. Look carefully.

381
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:41,229
- Look, someone's waiting over there.
- Yes this is he.

382
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:46,174
- If that person is not the person we are looking for. Let's phone him. A car is coming from behind, be careful while turning.

383
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:51,294
- Shall I come back from here?

384
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:53,135
- Let's ask this guy.

385
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:54,713
- Hello
- Hello

386
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:57,484
- You are Mr. Rifat, aren't you?
- Yes, you must be Ceyhun Bey?

387
00:39:57,484 --> 00:40:01,388
- Ok son, I'm hanging up the phone, my guests have arrived.

388
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:02,532
- Welcome.

389
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:06,364
- Hello. We talked to you on the phone.
- Yes

390
00:40:06,918 --> 00:40:09,586
- What will we do now? Is our destination too far away?

391
00:40:09,586 --> 00:40:12,858
- This is our village.
- Okay, so get in the car and let's go together.

392
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:16,135
- Do you have a place in the car?
- Yes, there is, we just need to move the bags to the side.

393
00:40:19,498 --> 00:40:20,336
- The back is full...

394
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:24,343
- Yes, we came prepared because we were shooting.

395
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,186
- Welcome to our village.

396
00:40:27,186 --> 00:40:28,354
- We're glad to be here.

397
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:32,923
- By the way, you know we're going to take a video recording. Do you mind if we record you on camera?

398
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:35,483
- No, it won't be a problem for me.

399
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:41,708
- Let's not record the people living in the village on camera. They don't want this.

400
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:46,695
- I guess there aren't many people out at this hour anyway...

401
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,954
- There are mostly young people walking around the village at these hours...

402
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,795
- You can stop the vehicle at a suitable place.

403
00:40:55,795 --> 00:40:57,563
- I also stop the camera recording.

404
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:01,274
- Is the camera recording?
- Yes recording .

405
00:41:01,274 --> 00:41:06,032
- We will record everything with the camera. For your information.
- Ok.

406
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:09,515
- We'll walk home from here together, and you'll tell us the story of the house.

407
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:13,037
- So let's start walking.
- Ok.

408
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,342
- What we do is this

409
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:20,146
- I actually don't believe in supernatural things.

410
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:29,154
- Together with Murat, we explore what people fear. And we are trying to understand the facts.

411
00:41:30,346 --> 00:41:33,682
- Then I was afraid of something too.

412
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:40,285
- But unfortunately, even if I show people the camera footage I have, they don't believe me.

413
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:43,763
- I know very well what I saw there. I even ran away.

414
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:51,629
- Later on, I started to research these kinds of events more broadly.

415
00:41:51,629 --> 00:41:58,641
- And I read and found terrible things about this village. There was a terrible house in this village and I met you to tell me about the events here.

416
00:41:59,705 --> 00:42:05,005
- To tell the truth, I believe what happened in that house. But I haven't seen it myself.

417
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:10,507
- From what I've heard around me, there are many stories about this horrible house.

418
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:16,895
- Has it happened to people you know?
- Yes, people I know. but i didn't see anything i just heard the stories.

419
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:29,315
- But I even have relatives who became stutters or paralyzed after their experiences.

420
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:32,731
- How many people live in this village?
- There are thirty houses in this village

421
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,235
- So everyone knows the story of that house.

422
00:42:35,235 --> 00:42:38,429
- They are already very old stories... I have an uncle.

423
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:39,534
- He stutters...

424
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:48,344
- The reason my uncle stuttered was because he walked into that house alone when he was little.

425
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:50,556
- So did you ever enter that scary house?
- No.

426
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:54,664
- You never entered.
- I am afraid because I believe and I do not enter.

427
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:57,969
- Let me tell you the story of the house.
- Please tell.

428
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:01,630
- A family lived in that house.

429
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:06,494
- But they lived a long time ago, 70 years ago.

430
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:20,269
- The father in that family was a bad person... he had connections with the jins.

431
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:28,753
- Do you mean the man used Jins and their powers with malicious intent?
- Yes.

432
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:33,023
- As I said, he has a connection with jins.

433
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:37,381
- The villagers called her the hodja of the Jinn.

434
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:44,291
- In the stories it is said that this man used jins for good and evil.

435
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:49,705
- He has used jins many times against the villagers and the people living around.

436
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:53,119
- So how did he use jins? when someone wants something?

437
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,379
- Yes, definitely.

438
00:43:55,379 --> 00:44:01,781
- He usually used jins for money when he was asked for help.

439
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:05,504
- They even came to him to find treasure.

440
00:44:05,504 --> 00:44:09,793
- It means that there are also those who look for it... So is there anyone who comes for the love spell?

441
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:15,977
- Friends, the car is coming from behind, let it pass the road, we will continue later.

442
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:34,973
