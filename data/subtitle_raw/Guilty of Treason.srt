People's Court and hang<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a traitor</font>

651
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:06,129
sooner the better excellent suggestion

652
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:08,139
on that is it enough will not serve our

653
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:11,920
purpose to destroy the man and create a

654
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:15,329
killer we must destroy something more

655
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:22,260
than the mere man so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

656
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:25,139
everything about his<font color="#E5E5E5"> reputation suppose</font>

657
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:28,930
suppose we told the world that he was

658
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:30,429
anti-semitic but everyone in Hungary

659
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:32,679
knows that the Cardinal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not Addison</font>

660
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:34,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> protect the Jews</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against the Nazis</font>

the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside does not know about</font>

663
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:43,239
that charge of anti-semitism will be

664
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:45,339
effective in time we repeated often

665
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:49,259
enough like Hitler leave me the

these things even an anti-semitic

675
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,530
traitor must be brought to trial at

676
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:22,219
exactly the right time not to assume not

677
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:26,210

as if nothing had happened retrieved our

1001

coffee read<font color="#CCCCCC"> on newspapers and wonder</font>

1002
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,430
whether the Cardinal was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little out of</font>

say so Stephanie I'm afraid you're much

1008
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:23,619
too impressed with kelly at your

1009
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:27,339
acceptance of even temporary employment

1010
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:29,769
the Secretary's most indiscreet Kelly is

1011
01:01:27,338 --> 01:01:33,099
a very courageous<font color="#CCCCCC"> man perhaps so but</font>

1012
01:01:29,768 --> 01:01:35,498
he's a very bad reporter the first duty

1013
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:37,869
of a good reporter is to survive long

1014
01:01:35,498 --> 01:01:41,558
enough to tell the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> story if I</font>

1015
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:43,450
doubt the caliber are you trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

me something Santa I only<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I</font>

01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:14,269
without delay will not be easy night his

1047
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eminence was arrested he wrote a</font>

in his own handwriting but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

1057
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:35,179
merely remind the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> His</font>

considerable pressure how will that look

1060
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:44,089
before a jury there will be no jury case

1061
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:48,590
will be tried before five judges our own

1062
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:51,110
choosing tell me doctor are you quite

1063
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:53,960
sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find every inducement with the</font>

Cardinal every type of treatment has

1065
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:58,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">been considered comment commissar but</font>

1066
01:04:56,449 --> 01:05:00,319
since it is desired to present the

1067
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:02,179
prisoner in court in the near future we

1068
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,670
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it advisable to concentrate</font>

1069

on psychological rather than on physical

1070
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,809
pressure we have therefore automated

1071
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:11,780
periods of sympathy and understanding

1072
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:15,199
