00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,771
Malcolm?!

3
00:00:58,505 --> 00:00:59,941
You want your dinner now?

4
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:08,548
I made fish sticks with mashed
potatoes and string beans, okay?

5
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:10,684
Did you hear me?

6
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:14,354
Well, if you're not going to
tell me what you want,

7
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:17,357
I'm going to make these decisions
for you and you get what you get.

8
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,558
Christ!

9
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,728
The older you are, the more you
remind me of your father.

10
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:22,796
What's that, Mal?

11
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,397
What is that thing?

12
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:33,040
Did you just do what
I think you did?

13
00:01:35,042 --> 00:01:37,611
Oh, Mal...

14
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:40,847
Who....who's going to
clean this up now?

15
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,246
So, how we doin' here?

16
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:02,782
Fine.

17
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,951
Pull off your hoodie.

18
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:10,157
What's your name?

19
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:12,293
Harry Haller.

20
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:14,228
This is private property, son.

21
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,931
Unless you got business here,...
you have to leave.

22
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:26,873
C'mon, kid, just put your shit together.
You don't want to get arrested.

23
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,075
You know you don't.

24
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,778
Look, I'll give you a ride.

25
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,116
I'm movin'

26
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,185
Thank you.

27
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:40,187
I just think it's sad...

28
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,822
What's sad?

29
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,193
That guys like you are
brainwashed by corporations into

30
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:48,761
de-humanizing yourself by
de-humanizing others...

31
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,697
...and I think it's sad that
guys like me...

32
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,066
...can't just sit wherever they
want to sit.

33
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,934
Okay, let's go.

34
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:57,704
Big Brother's watching you too!

35
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:00,307
I don't even know
what that means.

36
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:02,343
Why would you?

37
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,314
Pull your pants up!

38
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,901
Hey, Jeff.

39
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:29,736
What's up, Adelle?

40
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,539
Where's the gang?

41
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,576
What'd that cop want?

42
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:36,976
I don't know.

43
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,279
He was just bored.

44
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:41,582
Did he ask you to
pull up your pants?

45
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:43,184
Of course.

46
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,652
Original.

47
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:47,720
Probably the wittiest things
he's ever said.

48
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:50,056
It's like what Orwell said.

49
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:53,194
"We all live in a giant machine.
We're nothing but numbers."

50
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:57,665
"No one needs to torture me to behave...
no cage of rats around my head.

51
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:00,133
I have no choice
but to behave."

52
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:04,737
And that's what they want.

53
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,208
For you to give in.

54
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:10,910
So think about the rats and the
futility, you know what I say?

55
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:15,915
Fuck it.

56
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,618
Look...

57
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:19,852
...they made that sidewalk to
look like a sidewalk

58
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:24,658
to make this mall look like a
place where people thrive.

59
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:26,826
But it's not real.

60
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:30,096
No one walks on their
soul-less paths.

61
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:34,033
No one cares about
their dystopian landscaping.

62
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,504
This place is like a cardboard
cut-out of a Mall.

63
00:07:37,538 --> 00:07:41,442
We live in a world generated by
computers and corporations.

64
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:45,778
A reality designed to replicate
a real human experience.

65
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:48,915
Artificially scented candles.

66
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,584
Mmmm...

67
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:52,620
Artificial sex appeal.

68
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,490
Cultural simulation.

69
00:07:57,558 --> 00:07:59,826
Nostalgia.

70
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,828
Fabricated memories.

71
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,569
Manufactured happiness.

72
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,673
Hot cookies!
Fresh out of the oven!!

73
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,442
Just like Mom never really made.

74
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:17,977
Those smell good.

75
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,079
"It's a bad joke.
A violent abortion....

76
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:24,951
...of the primal mother. A barbaric
and hopeless catastrophe of nature.

77
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,487
To the Steppenwolf,

78
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,156
...man is not merely a partially-rational
animal but a child of the gods,

79
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:33,661
...destined to perfection
and immortality."

80
00:08:39,098 --> 00:08:41,034
You keep a bookmark in that?

81
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,036
Yeah

82
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:45,104
So I don't lose my place.

83
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:46,707
That's cute.

84
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,477
Steppenwolf, huh?

85
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:54,147
What is it about... a wolf, like,
Whitefang or something?"

86
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,384
Not really.

87
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:17,738
There's no smokin' here, sir.

88
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,574
Fill 'em with high test.

89
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,743
High test don't work good
on lawn mowers, sir.

90
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:25,412
I'm not mowin' lawns, chief.

91
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:28,816
I mean, he's cute!

92
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,784
He's got great eyes.

93
00:09:30,818 --> 00:09:33,052
But his voice is so high...

94
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,022
it sounds like a girl.

95
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,190
Hey, Cherise, hold on.

96
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:40,126
Got to ring up this freak.
One second.

97
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,101
Uh, forty-eight fifty
with the gas.

98
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,703
And a packet of Reds.

99
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,846
Are you gonna get me
any matches?

100
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:07,654
Are you gonna get me a bag?

101
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,377
You should think about goin' on a
diet, you're a bit overweight.

102
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,214
You smell.

103
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,083
And have bad breath.

104
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,084
Ya think so?

105
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,753
Yeah.

106
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:43,724
You think MY breath smells bad,
you should taste my cock

107
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:46,959
after it's been jammed up your
chubby pink butt.

108
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:52,231
My sperm's probably a lot healthier for
you than the shit you've been eating.

109
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:54,066
Would you like that?

110
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,104
Would you like to suck on my
shit covered prick?

111
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,508
No.

112
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,778
Well, then when someone gives you advice,
you be polite enough to take it...

113
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:07,915
...and say "thank you"
afterwards.

114
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,950
Than....thank you.

115
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:18,625
Do you want to push the little red button?
Yeah, go ahead!

116
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,993
You just gotta be ready
for the consequences,

117
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:23,362
cause all I'm doin'
right now is just talking.

118
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,998
And believe you me,
I can do a whole lot more.

119
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:52,693
That kid's gonna to wake up one day and
realize it's not his wife he hates....

120
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,761
...it's his mother.

121
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:58,832
But since he married his mother,
it'll be too late to do anything about it.

122
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,033
Where do you come up
with these things?

123
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:04,203
I collect observations.

124
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,639
You should write
them down, Jeff.

125
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:06,874
Write a book.

126
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,842
I will.

127
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:12,078
Tell me some more
of your observations.

128
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:16,182
Alright.

129
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,184
See that guy?

130
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,589
He thinks stewardesses
like him...

131
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:26,158
...but that's just how they treat
everybody in business class.

132
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:27,895
Your shrimp cocktail sir.

133
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:34,568
He had a brief
affair with his secretary

134
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,302
in Chicago before
things got too weird.

135
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:37,336
I mean, he loves his wife...

136
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,674
...but he hasn't had
sex with her in six years.

137
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:42,910
Since they had the last son.

138
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:48,247
He's been dating
underwear models ever since.

139
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,182
Dinner's almost ready.

140
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,219
It all started with the lingerie
catalogues in his study while his wife was

141
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:57,724
making tuna sandwiches and his
daughter was practicing the trumpet.

142
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:02,094
He started to recognize the lingerie
models in the different catalogues.

143
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,765
He would create different
scenarios in his mind...

144
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,200
Ski trips.

145
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,102
...the "mile high" club.

146
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,807
He recognizes the girl in
that lingerie poster over there...

147
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,777
That's the one he saw
in another catalogue.

148
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,078
The one that likes it
where the sun don't shine.

149
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:23,850
What about her?

150
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,922
Oh, she just quit smoking.

151
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:32,993
Yeah! Yesterday she ate a whole
pint of ice cream by herself...

152
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,828
...while her kids
were takin' a nap

153
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,864
and her husband was watching the
"Monster Truck" show.

154
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:39,800
Then she went
digging in the garbage

155
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,935
for cigarette butts and
she found one.

156
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,469
Ugh!...

157
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:46,873
She looks at herself every
night in a full length mirror

158
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,208
She still thinks
she's sexy.

159
00:13:50,877 --> 00:13:52,278
But her husband doesn't.

160
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,247
He doesn't understand
her appetite.

161
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:58,018
Sugar makes her
feel better.

162
00:13:58,051 --> 00:14:00,453
God, shoot me if I ever
end up like that.

163
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,030
She thinks about
picking up complete strangers

164
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:12,131
and fucking them in
motel rooms and she knows...

165
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:14,500
...one night she's
going to, but hey....

166
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,303
...at lest she's gotten
over her drinking problem.

167
00:14:17,336 --> 00:14:20,107
She hasn't had an episode since
that dinner party last year.

168
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:08,822
<i>"I am, in truth,
the Steppenwolf that I often call myself.</i>

169
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:14,161
<i>That beast astray that finds neither
home nor joy nor nourishment...</i>

170
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:19,032
<i>...in a world that is strange
and incomprehensible to him."</i>

171
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:55,202
Now, that guy was the biggest, toughest kid
growing up in his neighborhood in Haiti.

172
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,972
He was good with his fists...

173
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:04,010
...so, he was hired by some local
goons to work to collect debts.

174
00:16:08,982 --> 00:16:11,250
But then he fell in love...

175
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,386
He wanted to start a new life,
so he moved over here.

176
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:18,524
And the two
of them got jobs...

177
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:22,661
...working as night janitors
at a high-tech company.

178
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:23,830
They worked hard.

179
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:27,500
And every morning at 2:00AM,
they would get together...

180
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,770
...and they would
eat cold chicken sandwiches.

181
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:34,174
When she died...

182
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:37,376
...there was an
emptiness left in him...

183
00:16:44,885 --> 00:16:47,988
He began to pray to the
Madonna for forgiveness.

184
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:51,457
He promised to pay penance for
his sins by working hard...

185
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,492
...and never hurting
anyone ever again.

186
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,567
Every night...

187
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,303
...he goes back
to his empty apartment...

188
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:08,275
...and he eats his fish stew and
he dreams of his Maria.

189
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:12,913
And every night, he gets down
on his knees and he prays.

190
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:19,552
His mind is full of
snakes and demons.

191
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,487
And he can't wait
for the morning...

192
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,557
...where he can get back up and
go back to his post at work.

193
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,627
Wow.

194
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:30,197
Heavy.

195
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,366
What about this guy?

196
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:43,375
He inherited the tuxedo store
from his old man twenty years ago.

197
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,013
He hates tuxes almost
as much as he hates his life.

198
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:49,515
But he knows the business.

199
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,383
He knows that when a tux loses
it's luster,

200
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:55,554
he can sell it to a store in
a shabbier neighborhood.

201
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,725
He knows that most
guys are only going to wear

202
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:01,328
a tux twice in their life.

203
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:02,461
Once at the prom.

204
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:05,198
Oh!

205
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:07,300
And once at their
kid's wedding.

206
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:14,773
He's cornered the
market on both of them.

207
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,277
He had a pointless
and awkward affair

208
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,545
with the girl
that does his books...

209
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:22,548
...even fucked her the night before her
wedding which gave him a nice little...

210
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:25,051
...ego boost.

211
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:28,121
But those days are long gone.

212
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,426
Jeff!

213
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,762
Yo, What's up?

214
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:39,099
Whacha doin', man?

215
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:40,532
You smoking?

216
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:41,600
No...

217
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,236
Look at this guy!

218
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:46,705
Hey, Adelle.

219
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:47,773
Hey.

220
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:49,742
Do you guys want to
go see a movie?

221
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:50,809
Which one?

222
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,178
I don't know.

223
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:55,447
The one with...
you know, the guy...

224
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:56,448
Shel's working the door.

225
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:57,716
I'll see it.

226
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,119
I heard it sucks!!

227
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:00,253
Yeah.

228
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:01,553
Oh...

229
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:06,492
Are we going to get something to eat?
I'm starving.

230
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:10,163
Well....it depends on
how much cash Jeff has.

231
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,265
Yeah, Jeff! What do you got?"

232
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,766
Nothing.

233
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,634
Yeah, right!

234
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,370
You still owe me money.

235
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,605
You're an asshole, man!

236
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,143
Jeff...

237
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:27,213
you boys can figure out who owes who
later, but in the meantime...?

238
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:36,789
You can have my fries....

239
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:40,293
I don't eat saturated fats.

240
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:42,528
Oh!

241
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:48,834
Aww, jus...

242
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:50,270
Get me a smoothie,
alright?

243
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,172
Anything.

244
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:54,540
Dude...

245
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,177
That fuckin' whore gets you
every time!

246
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,313
Don't talk about her like that.

247
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,881
Dude. Whatever!

248
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:06,286
C'mon, man.
I got somethin' for you.

249
00:21:15,687 --> 00:21:17,790
You got something?

250
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,825
Maybe.

251
00:21:20,527 --> 00:21:22,027
He looks familiar.

252
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:42,848
Sir.

253
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:45,251
What're you doin'?

254
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,685
- What?
- C'mon, let's go.

255
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,587
- Let's go
- What?

256
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,723
Let's go!

257
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:53,560
That's ecstasy?

258
00:21:53,592 --> 00:21:55,228
Doesn't look like "Ex".

259
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:56,496
It is.

260
00:21:56,529 --> 00:21:58,764
I think it's "acid".

261
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,400
I don't know, man...

262
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:01,568
Dude!

263
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,903
I don't think it's a good night
for that kind of shit.

264
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:07,940
Okay. Why not?

265
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,809
I don't know... you know... I just
wanna hang out...

266
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,644
..talk to Adelle.

267
00:22:12,678 --> 00:22:14,880
Fuck, Adelle, man!

268
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:17,383
Adelle is brain dead.

269
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,319
What's your thing
with her, anyway?

270
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,788
She's nobody.

271
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,324
She's not nobody.

272
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:28,026
Have you ever had a
conversation with her?

273
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,563
There's not a
thought in her head.

274
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:31,897
She just smokes cigarettes.

275
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,665
Yeah, and she's also
incredibly beautiful.

276
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:35,901
She is?

277
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:38,338
Yeah, she is.

278
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,309
I guess I... never noticed
her looks before.

279
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:47,012
She has a gravity.

280
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:50,350
You know, she's not like
the other girls.

281
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:52,318
Gravity?

282
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:53,652
An energy.

283
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:57,590
A sense of purpose, you know?
She's...

284
00:22:57,624 --> 00:22:59,492
You're stoned, son!

285
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:01,628
No, I'm not.
You know what your problem is, dude?-

286
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:02,828
-No, Beckett, tell me.

287
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:06,399
You believe in, like, some kind
of life force-

288
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:07,600
- Not this
again, Beckett.

289
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,636
You're superstitious.

290
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,839
C'mon'.

291
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,941
I don't want to
do it alone.

292
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:17,743
Then don't.

293
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:21,581
I already did.

294
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:23,483
You did?

295
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:25,418
Do you feel anything yet?

296
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:31,457
No... I just did it like
a half hour ago.

297
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:35,295
Fuck It!

298
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:39,031
What are you guys doin'?

299
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:40,466
Nothing.

300
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,237
Dude, I forgot your smoothie.

301
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,471
Ah, that's fine-

302
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,906
Hey, guys, something is happening, okay?
Check it out.

303
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,644
I was having a smoke and these cops came out
of the doors with this pervert in handcuffs.

304
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:52,778
Pervert?

305
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:54,214
Yeah! Pervert, man,
peeping tom.

306
00:23:54,247 --> 00:23:56,683
He was hanging around the dressing
rooms trying to scope some bush.

307
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:57,684
Did he?

308
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:58,984
Well, yeah, I guess. C'mon!

309
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:02,655
Aren't you comin'?

310
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,890
I don't want to see a pervert.

311
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:07,059
Yeah, me neither.

312
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:08,894
Whatever....your loss.
This way. Go!

313
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:18,036
So, how's it goin'?

314
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,372
Hmm?

315
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:21,374
Uh, how's it goin'?

316
00:24:22,642 --> 00:24:24,711
It's going.

317
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,747
Alright!

318
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:44,863
Are you married?

319
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:45,931
What?

320
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:48,166
Your wife can
come pick up the car.

321
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,136
In the meantime, you have
the right to remain silent.

322
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:54,006
Wait a minute, c'mon.
Am I under arrest?

323
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,242
What do you think this is, you think you
can keep doing this without getting caught?

324
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:58,711
You have the right
to remain silent.

325
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:00,613
Anything you say can be
used against you...

326
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:02,315
- But... this is just... but wait a
second, you guys!

327
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:04,384
- C'mon, you saw her!
- If you can't afford one...

328
00:25:04,417 --> 00:25:05,752
But she did this shit on...

329
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,654
Do you understand these rights
that I have been saying to you?

330
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:09,921
She did that shit on purpose!

331
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:13,859
- She was real pretty, right?
- Right!

332
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,127
Okay?

333
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,830
So... look, I'm only human,
you know?

334
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,933
My niece was raped last year.
Now get in the fucking car!

335
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:24,671
- Let's go!
- Aright, Jesus!

336
00:25:24,704 --> 00:25:27,139
Alright, alright!

337
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:29,007
Fucking perv!

338
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,054
Wait... Nope, it is. It is him!
Hey! Hey!!

339
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:43,088
- Pervert!
- Yo, dude!

340
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:45,792
- That's the perverted man!

341
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:51,664
- Hey! Hey! You like
what you see, man?

342
00:25:51,698 --> 00:25:53,131
....Pervert!

343
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,000
Busted!

344
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:56,502
<i>"Life is always frightful.</i>

345
00:25:56,536 --> 00:26:00,707
<i>We cannot help it and we are
responsible all the same.</i>

346
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,744
<i>One is born and,
at once, one is guilty."</i>

347
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:49,020
You got it! Tomorrow!

348
00:26:50,423 --> 00:26:52,759
Asshole!

349
00:26:56,562 --> 00:26:58,598
You're the fucking...

350
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:05,170
We're closed.

351
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:15,213
I told you we're...

352
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:19,184
C'mon, man!

353
00:27:19,217 --> 00:27:21,454
Is that really you, Malcolm?

354
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,256
My God!

355
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,024
Look at you!

356
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,328
Long time, my friend!

357
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:34,834
Got to be at least,
like, 4 or 5 years?

358
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:37,068
You look great, man!

359
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:39,171
You've grown!

360
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:41,006
By the way, how's your Mom?

361
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,340
Huh?

362
00:27:44,444 --> 00:27:46,846
Mal, what's up?

363
00:27:48,046 --> 00:27:49,882
Hey, what are you doin'?

364
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:54,419
What's up, man?

365
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:57,790
You come to rob me?

366
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,324
C'mon!

367
00:27:59,357 --> 00:28:02,462
You want the tuxes?
You can have'em.

368
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:04,931
You want the money, you know
where it's at.

369
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:06,998
Same old place as before.

370
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:11,504
I don't fuckin' care, you see, I'm insured.
Take whatever you want....

371
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:13,338
...Get the hell out of here.

372
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:18,210
You heard me...

373
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:21,012
Take the money...

374
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,882
And leave...

375
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,250
Through the back door...
Okay?

376
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:29,254
Because security is going to be
here any minute.

377
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:31,323
And I need to get goin'.

378
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:34,059
Fuck!

379
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,061
That's not funny, man!

380
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,938
So, Adelle,
what are you doing in the fall?

381
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:51,109
I'm movin' to New York,
I'm gonna... model.

382
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:52,477
Oh!

383
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:54,379
Well, I think of
it this way...

384
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:56,983
They always need new models
and you don't have to be...

385
00:28:57,015 --> 00:29:00,987
pretty in an old fashioned way,
you can be interesting.

386
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:06,859
I think you're beautiful.

387
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,394
In an old-fashioned
kind of way.

388
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:11,931
..figure the worst
I can do is porno.

389
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:13,465
What?

390
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:20,372
I said the worst I can do is porno,
what, does ecstasy make you deaf?

391
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:23,208
No..I just...

392
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,277
Wait....how did you
know about...?

393
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,078
Duh!...

394
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:29,514
Beckett did it.
Of course you were going to do it.

395
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:34,185
But Adelle, seriously...

396
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:35,487
That would be horrible...

397
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,055
I'm joking.

398
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,090
God.

399
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:42,828
Oh!

400
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:52,470
I was serious when I said I
thought you were beautiful.

401
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:56,042
Jeff...

402
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:58,578
Are you saying you like me?

403
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:01,112
Um...

404
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,583
Like you want to go out with me?

405
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:06,251
Yes.

406
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:07,452
And fuck me and stuff?

407
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:08,988
What?

408
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:10,255
Is that what you're sayin?

409
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:11,256
No!

410
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,025
N..no, no, no. That's not what
I'm saying...

411
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:15,260
You don't want to fuck me?

412
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:17,897
No! I...

413
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,097
You're messing with me, right?

414
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,702
No, I just want to know if you
want to fuck me and stuff.

415
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:24,369
And stuff?

416
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:26,204
You know...

417
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:30,141
Okay, this is seriously
weirding me out.

418
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:33,012
Why is this weird? You just told
me you thought I was beautiful

419
00:30:33,045 --> 00:30:36,314
which make me think that you like
me and when a guy likes a girl...

420
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:39,018
he wants to fuck her, right?

421
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:41,219
Yeah... but.

422
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:42,554
And stuff.

423
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:46,124
Exactly what kind of "stuff"
are you talking about?

424
00:30:46,157 --> 00:30:49,561
Blow jobs, rim jobs,
licking your balls, going down,

425
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,496
you know... stuff.

426
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:53,565
Please stop it.

427
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:55,266
You don't' want me
to lick your balls?

428
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,301
No!

429
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:59,571
Why not?

430
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:02,507
I just want to hang
out with you.

431
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,610
I think I might be
in love with you, Adelle.

432
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:13,518
Are you okay?

433
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:15,253
Did I hurt your feelings?

434
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:17,288
No.

435
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,324
I don't know...
it's just...

436
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,160
We never really...

437
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:24,529
Talked before this...

438
00:31:25,563 --> 00:31:27,332
Do you really love me?

439
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,366
C'mon...

440
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,969
Do you?

441
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,272
Yes.

442
00:31:34,305 --> 00:31:36,108
Jeff.

443
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:39,477
Can I something and promise me
you won't... get mad.

444
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:42,748
Yeah.

445
00:31:42,782 --> 00:31:44,315
You're...

446
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:48,219
really... unexciting.

447
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:26,257
This is fucking crazy!

448
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:29,829
Malcolm? Please...

449
00:32:31,163 --> 00:32:36,234
L-listen to me. I-I have money.
You can get whatever you want.

450
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:40,338
But you've got to get the hell
out of here before the cops come.

451
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:43,241
You understand
what I'm telling you?

452
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:46,444
I won't tell
'em I recognized you.

453
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,579
Swear.

454
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,050
Do you want
a second chance, Barry?

455
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:55,487
Do I want a second chance?

456
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,789
Yeah.

457
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:59,158
That's what I want.

458
00:32:59,191 --> 00:33:03,095
Well, where was the fuck was my second
chance when you fired me you fucking faggot!

459
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:04,262
Huh?

460
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:06,198
Where the fuck was
my second chance?

461
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:07,632
You ruined
my fucking life!!

462
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:11,237
I ruined your life?

463
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:13,438
You're fuckin'
out of line, man!

464
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:16,242
Did I shove those drugs
down your throat?

465
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,844
Did I skim money?

466
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:20,478
You gave me no option, man.

467
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:21,814
I had to fire you.

468
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:25,550
You see I... run... a business!!

469
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:29,789
Not any more!
Fucking idiot.

470
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,458
Don't do this to me, Mal.

471
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,493
Hey, get away from there.

472
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:40,331
Don't fuck it up, Mal.

473
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,300
Please!

474
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:49,141
You can take
everything I have, Mal.

475
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:51,576
Please!

476
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:53,846
No! No! Please!

477
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:24,569
Any available units
in the vicinity of East Valley Mall

478
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:29,874
we have a 4-17 shots fired. Suspect
still at location believed to be armed.

479
00:35:29,909 --> 00:35:32,610
This is Unit 3, we're right outside
the Mall, we'll check it out.

480
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:34,380
Copy that Unit 3.

481
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:45,291
I'm going to un-cuff you.
Give you a summons.

482
00:35:45,324 --> 00:35:46,858
Are you serious?

483
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:49,494
Yeah, today's your lucky day.

himself and in his own life.</i>

500

503
00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:33,137
They're sayin' it
was a disgruntled employee.

504
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,674
Set fire to the place, I guess
he killed someone too.

505
00:41:35,707 --> 00:41:37,309
Uh.... Did they get the guy?

506
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:40,612
I don't think so...
He might still be in there.

507
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:42,847
That's exciting!

508
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,752
Maybe he'll come here,
we can buy him a drink.

509
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:50,722
I hate the Mall.
I hope it burns to the ground.

510
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:54,225
I'm kidding!

511
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:55,694
Right!

512
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:09,907
I'm Donna.

513
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,677
Ahh... I'm Lenny.

514
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,811
Hi, Lenny.

515
00:42:13,844 --> 00:42:15,647
You come here often?

516
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:17,882
Me? Uh, no...
I'm just... passin' through.

517
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:19,351
I'm stayin' at the hotel
next door.

518
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:22,421
Hmm...

519
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:24,723
I'm just a housewife.

520
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:26,792
Oh!

521
00:42:26,824 --> 00:42:29,226
Just another
bored housewife.

522
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,698
Living in America.
Ha ha ha.

523
00:42:33,699 --> 00:42:35,299
Mm.

524
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:37,402
How're the rooms over there?

525
00:42:37,436 --> 00:42:39,904
Ah... They're nice...
you know... Not bad.

526
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:44,743
Wow! Gosh! There's another one.
This thing must be serious, huh?

527
00:42:44,776 --> 00:42:46,877
What kind of name
is "Lenny"?

528
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,846
Ah, it was my
grandfather's name.

529
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:50,415
Mm...

530
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:52,883
You know, I'll bet this thing
is like 5 alarms.

531
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,823
Maybe you could see it better
from your room.

532
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,325
I wonder?

533
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:04,929
Let's go see...

534
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:09,233
Donna...

535
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:11,703
Uh... would you
excuse me for a minute.

536
00:43:11,737 --> 00:43:13,772
I have to run
to the little boy's room.

537
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:15,774
Certainly!

538
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:22,012
I'll, uh... be back in a second.

539
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:23,280
Mm.

540
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,958
Ed, where's Tom?

541
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:50,127
He was right over there
a minute ago.

542
00:46:05,242 --> 00:46:06,711
Oh.....shit!!!

543
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:08,379
Dude! It's the pervert!!

544
00:46:10,715 --> 00:46:12,483
Oh... Hey, man, did you escape?

545
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:13,685
I think he's in shock.

546
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:15,519
Are you in shock, dude?

547
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:17,254
Look,
he's still got his handcuffs on,

548
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:19,256
and he's all burnt up and shit.

549
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,226
Dude! The cop car blew up.
He must have flew through the air

550
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:24,729
and landed right here!
Wild!!

551
00:46:24,763 --> 00:46:26,096
Dude. Are you alright?

552
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,298
No.

553
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:28,833
Let me see these handcuffs.
Does this hurt?

554
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:30,234
No, don't do that, man.

555
00:46:30,267 --> 00:46:32,369
- Why not?
- We could kill this guy!

556
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:35,105
We could throw him in the woods.
No one would ever know!

557
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:37,141
This is the guy who was looking
at dressing rooms

558
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:38,375
With girls
in the dressing rooms.

559
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,410
He likes to look at pussy.

560
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:41,613
I know,
show him your puss, Shel.

561
00:46:41,646 --> 00:46:44,214
Do you want to see my pussy?

562
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:46,116
No, I wanna go home.

563
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:48,552
Well,
if we don't get these handcuffs off...

564
00:46:48,587 --> 00:46:51,488
You might never get free.
It'd be like stuck on a

565
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:53,692
deserted island.
You'd probably starve.

566
00:46:53,725 --> 00:46:55,492
This is like the slaves, man.

567
00:46:55,526 --> 00:46:57,596
This is what it was like
for the slaves.

568
00:46:57,629 --> 00:46:58,763
What slaves?

569
00:46:58,797 --> 00:47:01,666
My ancestors.
The African slaves.

570
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,467
Are you still
trippin', Beckett?

571
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,869
What?

572
00:47:04,903 --> 00:47:06,605
There you guys are.
What the hell?

573
00:47:06,638 --> 00:47:09,206
Yeah, check it.
It's the fucking pervert.

574
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:12,142
He must have escaped when
the nut job blew up the cop car.

575
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:14,746
Dude, this is like
that thing out in Arizona.

576
00:47:14,779 --> 00:47:16,648
I heard he's
hiding out in the woods.

577
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:19,249
I hear he has, like... a flame
thrower or something.

578
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:20,284
- What?
- Wow? Cool...

579
00:47:20,317 --> 00:47:22,286
Dude! This is going to
be on TV, man!

580
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,554
All over the fuckin' world!

581
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:24,789
Dude, we gotta get on TV

582
00:47:24,823 --> 00:47:26,323
YES! Let's go!!

583
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,328
Jesus...

584
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:33,597
Those must hurt.

585
00:47:33,632 --> 00:47:34,933
Everything's going to be okay.

586
00:47:34,966 --> 00:47:37,669
Here... let me help you up.

587
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:41,906
I'm just trying to help, man,
you don't look too good.

588
00:47:52,282 --> 00:47:53,652
Alright, everybody, let's go!

589
00:47:53,685 --> 00:47:54,953
Split it up.

590
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:57,254
Six over here,
three in the middle.

591
00:49:31,015 --> 00:49:34,618
Hey.
You just come from the Mall?

592
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:36,386
Yeah.

593
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,355
What's happening? We're not-
we're not gettin' much.

594
00:49:38,388 --> 00:49:41,793
They said a guy killed a cop.
Maybe a couple of other people?

595
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:43,594
Yeah, that's what I heard.

596
00:49:43,627 --> 00:49:45,696
God,
I hope it isn't someone I know.

597
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:47,899
Someone somebody knows.

598
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:49,801
Uh....what are ya drinkin'?

599
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:51,335
Some beer.

600
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:52,636
Yeah...

601
00:49:56,975 --> 00:49:58,777
It's on the house.

602
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,711
Thanks.

603
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:10,054
I used to always
come here with my parents

604
00:50:10,088 --> 00:50:12,422
before they got divorced.

605
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:16,493
My Dad always ordered the steak.
Medium rare.

606
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:18,997
My Mom always ordered the fish.

607
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:24,035
As if by ordering fish, she was
somehow improving herself.

608
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:27,172
She was always trying to
improve herself.

609
00:50:27,205 --> 00:50:31,176
I never noticed any change.

610
00:50:35,379 --> 00:50:38,016
You alright?

611
00:50:39,017 --> 00:50:40,684
I just...

612
00:50:40,717 --> 00:50:43,453
...saw a guy on a stretcher.

613
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:45,689
I think he might
be dead.

614
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:47,658
That sucks.

615
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:57,367
Yeah.

616
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:06,044
So what are you doing sitting
here by yourself?

617
00:51:06,077 --> 00:51:09,680
People suck out loud.
I hate people!

618
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:11,515
Yeah, especially when there's a
lot of them.

619
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:15,519
I hate them individually too.

620
00:51:15,552 --> 00:51:18,857
Hate's a strong word.

621
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,391
I don't want to hate anybody.

622
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:26,164
You alright?

623
00:51:26,197 --> 00:51:31,135
Your eyes are all,
you know, weird.

624
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:32,736
Yeah.

625
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:34,438
I'm fine I'm just...

626
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:36,941
...hanging out.
You know.

627
00:51:36,975 --> 00:51:38,842
Kicking back....

628
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:44,182
You're hangin' out?

629
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:47,919
You look pretty
serious to me...

630
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,422
I do?

631
00:51:52,456 --> 00:51:54,725
Uh....

632
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:57,628
He smiles...

633
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,565
I like to hang out.

634
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:03,700
Kick back.
Let's kick back together.

635
00:52:07,038 --> 00:52:09,073
Thought you didn't like people.

636
00:52:09,107 --> 00:52:11,441
You're not people.

637
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:13,177
Yeah, what's your name?

638
00:52:13,211 --> 00:52:14,178
Jeff.

639
00:52:14,212 --> 00:52:16,014
You're Jeff?

640
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:19,017
Hi, Jeff.

641
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,184
What's your name?

642
00:52:20,218 --> 00:52:25,056
It doesn't matter. So, what...
are you, um, a student?

643
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:27,158
College, yeah.

644
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:29,526
Yeah? What are you studying?

645
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:30,794
Literature.

646
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:32,863
Really?

647
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:35,866
What's your favorite book?

648
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:38,036
Steppenwolf.

649
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:40,238
Steppenwolf.

650
00:52:40,271 --> 00:52:42,539
The band?

651
00:52:42,572 --> 00:52:46,510
No, it's written by...

652
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:47,844
Never mind.

653
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:50,814
Uh, I stick to movies anyway.

654
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:56,687
Oh, I like that, um, the book, the,
you know, about the vampires...

655
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,722
the ones that take place
in New Orleans.

656
00:52:58,755 --> 00:52:59,723
Anne Rice?

657
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:01,525
Yeah!

658
00:53:01,558 --> 00:53:06,230
No, I really, I mean...
New Orleans is a very sexy place...

659
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:11,135
...and I really like all that,
like, kooky voodoo stuff....

660
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:12,769
I should watch out!

661
00:53:12,803 --> 00:53:16,040
Yes, you should...

662
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:23,114
You sure you're alright?

663
00:53:23,147 --> 00:53:24,548
Yeah! Nah...

664
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:28,919
I'm fine. I just,
had a lot to drink.

665
00:53:28,952 --> 00:53:30,989
Maybe you should
get some air...

666
00:53:31,022 --> 00:53:34,058
"Human life is
nothing but a bad joke.

667
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:36,294
A violent abortion
of the primal mother.

668
00:53:36,327 --> 00:53:39,998
A hopeless and barbaric
catastrophe of nature..."

669
00:53:40,031 --> 00:53:43,633
Dude, snap out of it!
You're being anti-social!

670
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,936
Sorry.

671
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:48,605
Let me ask you something.

672
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:53,910
If you could go anywhere...
where would you go?

673
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:58,016
Vienna.

674
00:53:58,049 --> 00:54:00,118
How come?

675
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:03,287
Cause that's where Freud and
Beethoven used to hang out.

676
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:04,888
I'd like to go there and...

677
00:54:04,921 --> 00:54:07,858
...feel the history.

678
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:12,096
I like that.

679
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,865
Feel the history.

680
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:18,635
That's cool!

681
00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:22,240
That's intellectual. My husband
would never say something like that!

682
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:26,843
You're married?

683
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:32,816
You're supposed to check to see if a girl's
wearing a ring, when you talk to her.

684
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:33,884
I'm sorry.

685
00:54:33,917 --> 00:54:35,886
It's okay.

686
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:38,855
He's not here, he's home
with the kids.

687
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:42,193
You have kids?

688
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:44,162
Yeah...

689
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:47,231
What, are you surprised?

690
00:54:47,265 --> 00:54:52,103
No, it's just,
you look so... young.

691
00:54:54,105 --> 00:54:56,673
Maybe I am?

692
00:54:56,706 --> 00:54:59,377
Maybe I'm younger
than you?

693
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,912
Yeah.

694
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:07,351
Do you think I'm attractive?

695
00:55:07,385 --> 00:55:10,654
Yes.

696
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:16,059
What're you thinking?

697
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:18,895
That maybe I could...

698
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:21,165
...kiss you?

699
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:24,835
Hmm... That's funny.....

700
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:28,071
I was thinking the
same thing...

701
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:38,014
Wait! Oh, oh! Easy soldier,
I'm a married woman!

702
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:40,617
I'm sorry...

703
00:55:52,762 --> 00:55:55,799
I'll call you in ten minutes.

704
00:55:55,832 --> 00:55:57,033
Where you goin'?

705
00:55:57,067 --> 00:56:00,605
Tsk! Just pick up the phone.

706
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:24,462
Hello.

707
00:56:24,495 --> 00:56:26,730
This is Alonso.

708
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:29,799
Who is this?

709
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,101
Hi, Sheila!

710
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:33,870
I'll be right there.

711
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:36,307
Okay.

712
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:49,946
You must be Alonso

713
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,014
Yes.

714
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:55,353
I said 302.

715
00:57:55,386 --> 00:57:57,153
Oh.

716
00:57:57,187 --> 00:58:00,090
What took you so long?

717
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:02,826
The elevator.

718
00:58:02,859 --> 00:58:05,795
Well, Ándale! Andale.

719
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:07,897
Tsk.

720
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:10,668
Hmm...

721
00:58:11,602 --> 00:58:16,072
Would you like some beer,
vodka... wine?

722
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:17,508
Probably not a great idea.

723
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:19,410
How 'bout...

724
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:21,177
...some chocolate?

725
00:58:22,879 --> 00:58:26,216
You're gonna
need it for your energy!

726
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:00,250
Wow! You really
wolfed that down!

727
00:59:02,118 --> 00:59:04,187
Yeah.

728
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:09,959
You nervous?

729
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:11,828
Little bit.

730
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:15,298
Hey, wanna watch some porno?

731
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,299
Porno?

732
00:59:16,334 --> 00:59:17,401
Mm....

733
00:59:17,435 --> 00:59:21,405
They pipe it into all rooms,
for all the salesmen.

734
00:59:21,439 --> 00:59:24,874
I don't like porno.
It's fucked up.

735
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:26,209
Well...

736
00:59:26,242 --> 00:59:28,446
Alonso.

737
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:31,649
Do you like.....

738
00:59:31,682 --> 00:59:34,284
This?

739
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:35,985
Sí!

740
00:59:36,019 --> 00:59:38,021
Sí...

741
00:59:38,054 --> 00:59:41,024
Now you are speaking my lingo.

742
00:59:41,057 --> 00:59:43,026
You are a very... very...

743
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:46,896
...naughty pool boy.

744
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:01,579
You fuck me, Alonso!

745
01:00:01,612 --> 01:00:04,648
I see the way you look at me
in that cabana.

746
01:00:04,682 --> 01:00:05,783
Um....

747
01:00:05,816 --> 01:00:08,284
Oh, yes, with your greasy,
sweaty body...

748
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:09,319
You want me...

749
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:10,621
Yes you do!

750
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:12,656
Is that your car?

751
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,090
Yes.

752
01:00:14,124 --> 01:00:17,193
My keys are in my pocket.

753
01:00:19,663 --> 01:00:21,364
Thank you so much!

754
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:23,333
No problem.

755
01:00:23,366 --> 01:00:26,169
Here.
Let me just get the door.

756
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:29,305
Here.

757
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:30,907
You know, if you could just...

758
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:34,944
...uh, just take me to the Police
Station and they could help me get these-

759
01:00:34,978 --> 01:00:36,580
these cuffs off, okay?"

760
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:38,616
Aren't you a fugitive?

761
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:43,086
No, they let me go.

762
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,656
Do they hurt?

763
01:00:45,689 --> 01:00:48,358
Yes. If... if you have
something like a pin or something,

764
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,293
you could get me
out of these...

765
01:00:50,326 --> 01:00:52,630
That only works
in the movies, silly.

766
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:56,099
Oh, right. Okay

767
01:00:57,133 --> 01:01:00,471
Yo! FUCK!!...
Fuck!! Ah!!!

768
01:01:00,504 --> 01:01:02,506
Is that too tight?

769
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,675
Yes, it hurts!

770
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:08,244
Why did you do that for?
Why are you doing that?

771
01:01:08,278 --> 01:01:11,147
Please, make it go back.
Please!

772
01:01:11,181 --> 01:01:12,616
They don't go back.

773
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:16,252
I... just... make it
go back, okay?

774
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:19,122
They don't.

775
01:01:20,658 --> 01:01:22,460
Well, it hurts, okay?

776
01:01:22,493 --> 01:01:25,094
Why are you hurting me?

777
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:26,564
Why would I want to hurt you?

778
01:01:26,597 --> 01:01:29,467
I could think of much better
things to do.

779
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,101
What are you going to do?

780
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:34,370
Um, what are you going to do?

781
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:36,674
What do you want me to do?

782
01:01:36,707 --> 01:01:39,242
I want you to take the
handcuffs off, please.

783
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:42,178
What if I can't do that?

784
01:01:42,212 --> 01:01:44,748
Then just leave me alone.

785
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:47,050
And, uh, go away!

786
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,019
Don't you like me?

787
01:01:51,755 --> 01:01:54,057
Yes, I... I do, yes.

788
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:57,093
Well, then, what do you want me
to do with you?

789
01:01:59,597 --> 01:02:02,432
You're, like, my total slave
right now.

790
01:02:02,465 --> 01:02:05,034
Isn't that incredible?

791
01:02:06,704 --> 01:02:09,105
Bet you've been with hookers.

792
01:02:09,138 --> 01:02:11,474
No, I've never been
with a hooker.

793
01:02:11,509 --> 01:02:14,110
Bullshit!
You're a business man!

794
01:02:14,143 --> 01:02:16,379
You're always with hookers!
I know guys like you.

795
01:02:16,412 --> 01:02:17,380
No...

796
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:19,482
I know what you do...

797
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:22,051
I've never been with a hooker,
okay? I've never been with

798
01:02:22,085 --> 01:02:25,355
a prostitute or a massage
therapist or anything like that!

799
01:02:25,388 --> 01:02:27,257
Look, I didn't hurt you!

800
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:28,726
Of course you hurt me.

801
01:02:28,759 --> 01:02:30,393
No!

802
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:31,595
Wha... What are you doing now?

803
01:02:31,629 --> 01:02:32,596
Ow! Fuck!

804
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:34,130
Fuck!

805
01:02:34,163 --> 01:02:35,533
Fuck!

806
01:02:35,566 --> 01:02:37,267
Fuck!

807
01:02:38,569 --> 01:02:42,038
I don't like it when you lie.

808
01:02:44,842 --> 01:02:46,075
Do you wanna kiss me?

809
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:48,511
No! No.

810
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:52,448
You wanna kiss me??

811
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:54,384
Okay... yes...

812
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:57,120
Ah!

813
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:00,658
Okay, okay. Your hurting my...

814
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:02,392
It hurts my arm!

815
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:04,795
You're breaking it..."

816
01:03:18,742 --> 01:03:20,476
Take me! Take me! Oh! Oh!

817
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,614
<i>"A wild longing for
strong emotions and sensations...</i>

818
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,584
<i>...seethes in me.</i>

819
01:03:26,617 --> 01:03:30,320
<i>A rage against this toneless,
flat, normal and sterile life."</i>

820
01:03:41,832 --> 01:03:43,801
<i>"I have a mad impulse
to smash something."</i>

821
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:47,303
<i>"A warehouse, perhaps.</i>

822
01:03:47,337 --> 01:03:49,172
<i>Or a cathedral."</i>

823
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,209
<i>"Or myself.
To commit outrages...</i>

824
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:56,145
<i>To pull off the wigs of a
very few revered idols."</i>

825
01:04:20,603 --> 01:04:22,673
No! No, please stop!

826
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:24,474
Please!

827
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:25,843
Too late for that now, isn't it?

828
01:04:25,876 --> 01:04:31,214
Don't do this to me!
Please, don't torture me, okay?

829
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:32,916
Do you want me to make you come?

830
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:36,319
No...

831
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:39,255
Please, please, please!

832
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:42,625
No!

833
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:46,764
Okay, yes, yes, yes!

834
01:04:47,563 --> 01:04:50,299
Say... I'm a pervert.

835
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:53,369
No...

836
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:54,972
Say it!

837
01:04:55,005 --> 01:04:57,407
I... I can't....please...

838
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,276
Please. No!

839
01:05:02,412 --> 01:05:03,814
I'm a pervert.

840
01:05:03,847 --> 01:05:06,182
Say it over and over.

841
01:05:07,818 --> 01:05:09,687
I'm a pervert.

842
01:05:10,286 --> 01:05:11,387
I'm a pervert.

843
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:14,725
I'm a pervert.

844
01:05:15,693 --> 01:05:17,895
I'm a pervert.

845
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:24,902
I'm a pervert.

846
01:05:24,935 --> 01:05:28,471
God!

847
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:39,950
Oh, gross!

848
01:05:45,923 --> 01:05:47,024
Now, where are you goin'?

849
01:05:47,057 --> 01:05:49,258
Bye.

850
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:52,328
It's nice to meet you.

851
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:55,398
"For those who loved him,
only saw the one side of him.

852
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:57,700
Many loved him as a refined
and educated man...

853
01:05:57,735 --> 01:06:00,971
were horrified and disappointed when
they discovered the wolf in him.

854
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:02,638
And they had to
because Harry wished...

855
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,007
...as every
conscience being does...

856
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:06,744
...to be loved as a whole.
And, therefore, it was just with...

857
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:10,580
...those whose love he treasured
most that he could least of all...

858
01:06:10,613 --> 01:06:13,349
...conceal and deny the wolf."

859
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:29,665
Do you want to do it again?

860
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:32,936
Um... leave your phone number.

861
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:34,905
I mean right now.

862
01:06:34,938 --> 01:06:38,374
Oh... I gotta get home
to the hubby and rugrats.

863
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,379
Hi!

864
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:46,449
Yeah, no, I'm still
stuck in traffic!

865
01:06:46,482 --> 01:06:49,685
I know. I heard! It's awful.

866
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:53,791
Yeah... No, I'm fine.

867
01:06:53,824 --> 01:06:56,425
What did you give them?

868
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:59,562
Uh, fried chicken's nutritious!

869
01:06:59,595 --> 01:07:00,596
Mmmhmm....

870
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:02,498
No, don't let Nacho in,
though, because he was

871
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:05,668
down at the swamp all day
and he's totally stinky.

872
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:07,838
No, I... I'll deal with it
tomorrow.

873
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:11,707
Yeah. Love you too. Bye.

874
01:07:13,476 --> 01:07:18,115
So what has-has been going on?
I guess I should know?

875
01:07:18,148 --> 01:07:20,716
Eight people are dead.

876
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,552
Wow!

877
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:25,588
They think they cornered him
in the woods.

878
01:07:25,621 --> 01:07:27,958
They say he might be
wearing a tuxedo.

879
01:07:27,991 --> 01:07:32,461
Oh... I mean,
that is totally weird!

880
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:38,035
Okay. Umm... I have to go....

881
01:07:38,068 --> 01:07:42,638
Now, the room is on my credit
card, so don't break anything

882
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:45,108
Why would I break something?

883
01:07:45,142 --> 01:07:47,577
Mm.

884
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,579
Maybe you'll...

885
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:50,813
....pick up some....

886
01:07:50,848 --> 01:07:52,082
...innocent girl...

887
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,017
...at the bar...

888
01:07:54,051 --> 01:07:56,786
...break the bed.

889
01:07:56,819 --> 01:08:02,326
I just wanna lie here.

890
01:08:02,358 --> 01:08:06,562
You! Are a very bad boy!!

891
01:08:06,596 --> 01:08:09,900
I'm not going to be able
to walk tomorrow.

892
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:16,672
Bye, Tiger.

893
01:11:29,291 --> 01:11:31,392
Yeah, I like to ride that cock.

894
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:33,408
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

895
01:11:40,962 --> 01:11:41,900
Fuck.

896
01:11:42,618 --> 01:11:43,586
Jeff?

897
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:45,895
Jeff?

898
01:11:45,965 --> 01:11:47,201
Are you okay?

899
01:11:48,535 --> 01:11:49,942
It's really fucked up.

900
01:11:49,996 --> 01:11:53,540
Jeff! What are you doing?

901
01:12:44,089 --> 01:12:46,426
You.
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you,

902
01:12:46,459 --> 01:12:48,428
I've got an M-4 pointed
at your fucking head...

903
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:50,163
Get over here.

904
01:12:50,196 --> 01:12:51,964
Get over here.

905
01:12:57,403 --> 01:12:59,305
What're you doing here?

906
01:13:00,105 --> 01:13:01,640
Walking.

907
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:06,279
What are you, some fucking
wise-ass?

908
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:08,113
No.

909
01:13:11,151 --> 01:13:13,186
Do you know who I am?

910
01:13:13,986 --> 01:13:15,455
Yeah.

911
01:13:15,488 --> 01:13:18,391
Yeah? And who are you?

912
01:13:18,424 --> 01:13:21,126
Jeff.

913
01:13:22,195 --> 01:13:26,299
You know, some fucking
spade rental-cop shot me.

914
01:13:26,332 --> 01:13:28,100
Can you believe that?

915
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:29,902
Nine hundred
fucking cops out there

916
01:13:29,935 --> 01:13:32,971
and this fuckin' spade
rent-a-cop shoots me.

917
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:52,090
Sit down.

918
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,995
Then you're gonna help me.

919
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:07,507
I saw the fire.

920
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:10,142
I saw dead people.

921
01:14:10,175 --> 01:14:12,811
Oh, yeah? How'd they look?

922
01:14:12,844 --> 01:14:14,447
Squished.

923
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,150
That's it?
Just "squished"?

924
01:14:19,985 --> 01:14:22,120
Why'd you shoot them?

925
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:25,958
Cause they were there.

926
01:14:29,061 --> 01:14:31,264
I used to work at the mall.

927
01:14:31,297 --> 01:14:34,334
You could have shot me.

928
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:37,803
Oh, yeah?
Where did you work?

929
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:41,139
Taco Tonight.

930
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:46,945
Yeah, maybe.
I..I was at Tuxedo Time."

931
01:14:51,351 --> 01:14:57,290
Hey, hey, hey....you wouldn't happen
to have any speed on you, would you?"

932
01:14:57,323 --> 01:15:02,362
No, no. I had some ecstasy,
but Beckett took the rest.

933
01:15:02,395 --> 01:15:04,731
I fuckin' hate ecstasy...

934
01:15:06,299 --> 01:15:10,202
Oh, I hate fuckin' ecstasy.

935
01:15:10,235 --> 01:15:11,504
Yeah, me too.

936
01:15:12,605 --> 01:15:18,844
Okay, so. There's uh, there's a, um...
a .45...

937
01:15:18,877 --> 01:15:22,415
...in my bag.
And you're gonna get it.

938
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,418
Why?

939
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:28,354
So you can kill me?

940
01:15:28,388 --> 01:15:31,890
No, you idiot!
So you can kill me.

941
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:41,534
You, you, you,
you don't wanna be the hero?

942
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:45,371
You don't wanna be the
guy that shoots the madman?

943
01:15:45,405 --> 01:15:49,041
I... I, I can't do that.

944
01:15:49,074 --> 01:15:52,779
Fuck, you'll get laid, Jeff.

945
01:15:57,983 --> 01:16:03,055
This is one of those
life-changing moments, Jeff.

946
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:06,925
<i>You are willing to
die, you coward.</i>

947
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:12,831
<i>But not to live.</i>

948
01:16:20,972 --> 01:16:23,108
Jeff?

949
01:17:02,214 --> 01:17:06,918
I am not the
coward in the woods with a gun.

950
01:17:06,952 --> 01:17:12,257
He is stuck.
In his man-wolf dichotomy.

951
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:16,462
I am made up of
many more elements than that.

952
01:17:17,663 --> 01:17:21,032
I am not stuck.

953
01:17:21,066 --> 01:17:24,136
I am un-stuck.

954
01:19:55,555 --> 01:19:57,122
Dude, you can see everything!

955
01:19:57,155 --> 01:20:00,158
- Quick! We have to send this to this guy's wife!
- Yes!

956
01:20:00,191 --> 01:20:01,459
Hey, hey!
What's your wife's name?

957
01:20:01,493 --> 01:20:02,762
Dude, which one is she? Huh?

958
01:20:02,795 --> 01:20:03,763
What are you doing?

959
01:20:03,796 --> 01:20:07,033
It's the pervert!

960
01:20:08,366 --> 01:20:09,534
C'mon, give me my phone!

961
01:20:09,569 --> 01:20:10,636
Get out of here!

962
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:11,637
C'mon, man...

963
01:20:11,671 --> 01:20:12,872
Get the fuck out of here!

964
01:20:12,905 --> 01:20:14,139
My phone...

965
01:20:14,172 --> 01:20:17,509
Dude! Chill, we were just
monkeying around!

966
01:20:22,648 --> 01:20:26,318
Hey... are you okay?

967
01:20:27,352 --> 01:20:30,221
No... No, my...

968
01:20:31,591 --> 01:20:34,392
I can't feel my arms, man.

969
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:38,129
What happened?

970
01:20:38,163 --> 01:20:40,600
It's a long story.

971
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:42,902
Here, let's, let's...

972
01:20:42,935 --> 01:20:44,837
Please don't.

973
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:46,471
Just...

974
01:20:46,504 --> 01:20:48,373
...can't do it...

975
01:20:48,406 --> 01:20:50,743
Look, why do you have your
seatbelt on?

976
01:20:52,577 --> 01:20:55,648
So that I wouldn't escape.

977
01:20:57,282 --> 01:20:59,284
Well, okay... I'll just...

978
01:21:04,824 --> 01:21:06,826
Alright...

979
01:21:07,727 --> 01:21:10,562
Are you old enough to drive?

980
01:21:10,595 --> 01:21:12,564
Yes.

981
01:21:12,597 --> 01:21:15,101
Um...

982
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:18,403
Do you think that, uh...

983
01:21:18,436 --> 01:21:21,007
...that you could, take me home?

984
01:21:22,207 --> 01:21:24,576
Shouldn't I get you to
a hospital, uh, police station?

985
01:21:24,609 --> 01:21:25,778
They could get
the cuffs open...

986
01:21:25,811 --> 01:21:27,913
No, I'd like to...
just go home, please?

987
01:21:27,947 --> 01:21:29,481
Well, maybe I could
find some tools...

988
01:21:29,514 --> 01:21:31,884
Please, I just...

989
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:36,221
If you could just....

990
01:21:36,254 --> 01:21:39,792
...you know, drive me home
to my wife, you know...

991
01:21:39,825 --> 01:21:41,626
And, um...

992
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:43,796
...you'll help me with my pants.

993
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:46,431
Please?

994
01:21:46,464 --> 01:21:48,633
Okay....

995
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:55,607
Thank you...

996
01:21:56,876 --> 01:21:58,243
One, two, three...

997
01:21:58,276 --> 01:21:59,912
Okay...

998
01:21:59,945 --> 01:22:01,681
Okay, thanks.

999
01:22:24,003 --> 01:22:25,938
You want me
to get your wife?

1000
01:22:25,971 --> 01:22:28,874
No. You better get out of here.

1001
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:50,361
Tell me somethin'...

1002
01:22:51,831 --> 01:22:55,333
Do you know a red-headed girl, uh,
she's probably around your age...

1003
01:22:55,366 --> 01:22:58,603
...she hangs out
at the mall maybe?

1004
01:22:58,636 --> 01:23:00,840
Yes.

1005
01:23:01,907 --> 01:23:04,275
Is she a friend of yours?

1006
01:23:07,813 --> 01:23:09,915
No.

1007
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:11,751
Good.

1008
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:50,688
Babe, I'm home.

1009
01:23:54,093 --> 01:23:56,394
Hey.

1010
01:23:56,427 --> 01:23:59,031
Did you guys have a fun night?

1011
01:24:09,741 --> 01:24:14,046
Tsk! Oh, Nacho!
Nacho, you stinky, stinky dog!

1012
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:17,116
Come here.
You are a bad dog.

1013
01:24:17,149 --> 01:24:20,652
You shouldn't be in the house.

1014
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:41,606
<i>One day I would
be a better hand at the game.</i>

1015
01:24:41,639 --> 01:24:47,345
<i>One day...
I would learn how to laugh.</i>

1016
01:25:01,748 --> 01:25:06,748
