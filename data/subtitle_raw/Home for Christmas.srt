1
00:00:13,248 --> 00:00:15,915
(calming music)

2
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:21,051
- The thing is, I've
loved you from the moment

3
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:22,551
I set eyes on you.

4
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:26,230
Sorry, no, no, that was cheesy.

5
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:32,638
What I wanna say, what I've
wanted to say for months is,

6
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:37,168
I think I've fallen in love with you.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,621
Well, what do you think,
was it really that bad,

8
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:46,958
if you were Aiden, would
you run for the hills?

9
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:49,291
If you could run, obviously.

10
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:58,646
You like playing hard to get don't you?

11
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,897
Yeah yeah you can grin.

12
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:19,441
Bet you've had millions of
people tell you they love you.

13
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,243
Whereas I've had...

14
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,939
(cheerful music)

15
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:52,220
♫ Well you fill your
days with a long schedule

16
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:57,696
♫ Come time to breathe,
you don't even know how

17
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:04,936
♫ Kids in white T-shirts giving free hugs

18
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:09,103
♫ In the name of Jesus,
the gypsy boy shrugs

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,530
♫ Sometimes I feel so lonely

20
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:21,448
♫ With all this love all around me

21
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:37,492
♫ Singing is human but the birds do it too

22
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,548
♫ And there's nothing better than waking

23
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:43,903
♫ To the red robin's tune

24
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:48,492
♫ Well the wind blows softly
but the waves crash so strong

25
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:51,278
♫ And it rattles your wind pipes

26
00:02:51,278 --> 00:02:55,772
♫ And your voice sings its song

27
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:59,439
♫ Sometime I feel so lonely

28
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:05,460
♫ With all this love all around me

29
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,993
- So I need to tell you about Aiden,

30
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:28,926
he's scarily posh, but also charming,

31
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:32,684
grown-up, well-traveled
and impossibly intelligent.

32
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:35,168
Over the last month, the
urge to tell him how I feel

33
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,309
has become unbearable.

34
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,323
I can't put it off any
longer, I just need to find

35
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:41,323
the right way to say it.

36
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,765
I love you.

37
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:46,589
I love you!

38
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:50,050
I love you, I love you?

39
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:54,820
I love you, I love you!

40
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:58,061
I love you...

41
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,608
I love you.
- Thanks.

42
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,324
You're not so bad yourself.

43
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:09,817
- [Woman] Crap.

44
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:13,984
My first thought was to slide
behind the counter and hide.

45
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:17,708
My second thought was why
the hell did you do that.

46
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,208
- Hello, you okay?

47
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:23,825
You okay down there?

48
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,893
- Uhm, yeah, yeah I'm fine, I just...

49
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,690
Dropped my paperclip.

50
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,530
- Paperclip, okay.

51
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:42,450
Vital bits of office
equipment, paperclips, yeah.

52
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,450
Wouldn't wanna lose one.

53
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,601
- Uhm, how can I help?

54
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,582
- Is Mrs. Blackstock in?

55
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:56,244
- Edna, you wanna speak to her?

56
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:57,327
- Matt Jones.

57
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,878
- Beth, are you after a job?

58
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:02,628
- Kind of. Is she in?

59
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:09,686
- I'm afraid not, but I
might be able to help you.

60
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,619
Have you worked in a cinema before.

61
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:15,280
- Yes I have, a few actually.

62
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,809
- [Beth] Oh, any I might have heard of?

63
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,178
- CineFlex.

64
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:20,784
- Oh, which one?

65
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:24,158
- Oh a couple, do you want
me to list them for you?

66
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,715
- Oh yeah if you like.

67
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:28,957
- I'm sorry, I'm not being fair.

68
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:31,148
I'm the Southeaster Manager for CineFlex,

69
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:35,693
and we're expanding our
business to Brighton.

70
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:36,887
- Oh.

71
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,412
- I guess Mrs. Blackstock
hasn't come around

72
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:40,245
to talking to you yet?

73
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:42,676
- No.

74
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:44,908
- Ah, sorry.

75
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:50,420
Well anyway uhm, I should go.

76
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,399
It's nice to meet you, Beth.

77
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,719
By the way, I preferred
your final I love you,

78
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,052
it sounded the most sincere.

79
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,516
(groaning)

80
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:10,516
(upbeat rock music)

81
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:18,778
I swear mate, she
followed me to the cinema

82
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,528
I was visiting today.

83
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:23,255
I mean all I did was break up with her.

84
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,766
I didn't cheat on her, didn't
float with any of her mates,

85
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:29,319
didn't treat her badly, even
broke up with her face to face!

86
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,723
I split up with her three
weeks ago and since then,

87
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:34,997
she has turned up at my flat,
or my office every single day.

88
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:36,211
She posts notes through the
letter box, she's ringing

89
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:38,876
me all the bloody time.

90
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,405
She even e-mailed me some photos of her

91
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:43,214
to show me what I was missing.

92
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:44,464
- Naked photos?

93
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,552
- It's not funny.
- Call the police then.

94
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:52,075
- I can't, it's not like she's
threatening me or anything.

95
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:53,666
And anyway, what am I gonna say?

96
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,515
I'd like to make a complaint
because a beautiful blond

97
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,128
has threatened to shag me stupid.

98
00:06:58,128 --> 00:06:59,628
- Yeah good point.

99
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,926
- So what am I gonna do?

100
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,309
- Well here's what I'd do.

101
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:11,710
Take her up on the sexual
favours and then dump her again.

102
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,995
- I don't know why I
thought it was a good idea

103
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,978
asking for your advice.

104
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:17,895
(upbeat pop music)

105
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:35,263
- [Beth] I still remember
the first time I met Aiden.

106
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,878
- Evening pimp.

107
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:46,233
You're looking a bit
rosy tonight, what's up?

108
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,040
Acne medication stopped working?

109
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,957
- Yeah I could say the
same about your shampoo.

110
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,595
- Not bad Beth.

111
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:59,842
Certainly better than
your normal insane drivel.

112
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:02,027
(phone ringing)

113
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,668
- Good evening Beth
speaking how can I help you.

114
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:06,230
- [Woman] Beth, oh God!

115
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,890
- Sorry hold on I didn't get
that can you say that again.

116
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,868
- Beth it's Lizzie, oh
God I need your help.

117
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,160
- Liz, I told you, you
can't call me at work.

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,908
- Ah I'm stuck, I'm stuck in a window.

119
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:18,715
- What, how did that even happen?

120
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,412
- I'm trying to escape.

121
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:22,856
He just a fabulous turn
into a Mr. Flatulence.

122
00:08:22,856 --> 00:08:27,819
And he won't shut up, I
swear, he only pauses to fart.

123
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:31,294
I made an escape to the
loo, I can't breathe.

124
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:34,952
And well I had a
fantastical idea, and, well,

125
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,100
not so fantastic as it turns out,

126
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,143
now I'm stuck in a bloody toilet.

127
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:43,057
- Okay okay hang on, hang on.
(throat scraping)

128
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,071
Just don't go anywhere.

129
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:45,913
- Very funny.

130
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,040
- I'm sorry.
- What?

131
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,318
- Can I just?
(groaning)

132
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:49,151
- What?

133
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,490
- Bloody teenagers also,
they're taking pictures of me

134
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,914
on their mobile phone,
and I refuse to be on

135
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:55,636
You-bloodin'-Tube with my arse hanging out

136
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,086
the pub (mumbling), come
and rescue me or I swear

137
00:08:58,086 --> 00:08:59,164
our friendship is over.

138
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:03,262
- Okay sorry, my friend is
stuck in the toilet, no,

139
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:05,554
no she's not stuck in the
toilet, she's stuck in

140
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:07,513
the window of the toilet,
she was on a date.

141
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,346
- Classy date.

142
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:10,504
- No, no, the date wasn't in
the toilet, it was in the pub

143
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:13,055
but she went to the
toilet to try and escape,

144
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,743
and now she wants me to go and rescue her,

145
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,841
but obviously I can't,
because I'm stuck at work,

146
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,232
and if do go, my boss is
probably gonna fire me,

147
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:20,910
but if I don't go, then
Liz is definitely gonna

148
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,410
chuck me out.
- Wow, it's okay.

149
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,438
Go and rescue your friend,
I'll take over the booth,

150
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:30,728
just run through what I have
to do and I'll pick it up.

151
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:32,824
How hard can it be?

152
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:33,657
- Really?

153
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:38,067
It was ridiculous really, there
I was sitting in the cinema

154
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,374
where I'd spent six years
of my life waiting for

155
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,768
Hugh Grant to walk through the door,

156
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:46,392
and here he was, almost
exactly 10 months later,

157
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:49,608
and I was gonna tell him
just how much he meant to me.

158
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,025
What could possibly go wrong?

159
00:09:54,823 --> 00:09:56,941
It's fine, he probably
thought I said 10 o'clock,

160
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,000
I mean eight o'clock and 10
o'clock do sound a lot similar

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
when you mumble, which I
do, according to Aiden.

162
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,979
(phone ringing)

163
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,202
Aiden, oh, hi Mum.

164
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,586
- Delighted to talk to you to too.

165
00:10:24,586 --> 00:10:28,988
- Sorry I'm expecting
Aiden, anyway how are you?

166
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:30,350
- I'm marvellous, thank you.

167
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,294
Look I just called to tell
you I've booked a ticket

168
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:34,324
to Australia for you.
- What?

169
00:10:34,324 --> 00:10:38,289
- Australia, the flight's
on the 24th of December,

170
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,249
just think how exciting it'll be darling,

171
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:44,001
winging our way to a
new life over Christmas.

172
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:46,476
- Mom I've told you before,
I don't want to move

173
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:50,645
to Australia, I love Britain,
I've got loads of great

174
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:54,282
friends here, and not to
mention Aiden and a good job.

175
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:55,850
- A good job?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,668
- Printing tickets and
putting money in a till--

177
00:10:57,668 --> 00:10:58,626
(door knocking)

178
00:10:58,626 --> 00:10:59,908
- Mom I've gotta go, I think Aiden's here.

179
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,047
- About the ticket, shall I
send it to you or hang onto it?

180
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,313
- Mom I'm not going,
hopefully it's not too late

181
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:05,387
for you to get your money back okay?

182
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:06,919
- What?
- I've gotta go.

183
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,388
I'll speak to you tomorrow, okay bye.

184
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:09,611
- Beth!
- Bye.

185
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:10,444
Coming.

186
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,603
Oh, Aiden.
- Beth.

187
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:15,846
- You made it.

188
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:17,987
- You are dressed as a pumpkin, right?

189
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:19,154
- [Beth] Yeah.

190
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:24,946
- So there's something I've
been meaning to tell you.

191
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:26,940
- Oh well that's great, because
actually I've really wanted

192
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,677
to talk to you about something too.

193
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:30,677
- Beth, we need to talk.

194
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,456
I need some space.

195
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:42,340
- Sorry, sorry, say that again.

196
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,214
- [Aiden] I need some space Beth.

197
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:46,797
- Uh, space, right, great okay.

198
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,917
There you go, you got
like a whole extra metre.

199
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,943
- It's not working Beth.

200
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:56,539
- What's not working,
it's my outfit isn't it?

201
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,887
I knew that you would expect
me to be in something sexy

202
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:02,106
and not, you know a pumpkin,
so, don't worry, don't worry

203
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:04,250
I can just go and put on
my little black dress--

204
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,792
- Beth it's not about what you're wearing.

205
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,746
- Have I done something wrong,
is it something I've said?

206
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:11,802
- It's not you, it's got
nothing to do with you, it's--

207
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,691
- No don't say it, please.

208
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,524
- It's me.

209
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,223
- It's, it's fine, you've
obviously had a couple of drinks

210
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:28,922
and it's Halloween and
it's probably a full moon,

211
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,951
and you know what everyone's a bit crazy

212
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,799
when it's a full moon,
especially werewolves,

213
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,648
because you know they
just sit in the middle of

214
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:39,206
the field and howl, not
God, not that I'm saying

215
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:41,655
you're anything like a werewolf, because,

216
00:12:41,655 --> 00:12:44,061
I mean I don't care what
Lizzie says, I like the bushy

217
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:45,328
eyebrows and they don't even--

218
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,082
- Please don't make this more
difficult than it already is.

219
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,066
- No no no, it doesn't
have to be difficult,

220
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,921
I mean you're obviously
just having a shit day,

221
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:55,845
and I love space, I mean, I, I
love space, I need space too.

222
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,813
- Beth I'm sorry, look, I
just, I needed to escape

223
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,091
you know, you're a
lovely girl, you deserve

224
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,090
a much better than me--

225
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,757
- But I don't want
anyone else, I want you.

226
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:11,910
- I'm sorry, really I am.

227
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:16,673
Perhaps it's best if I just go.

228
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,006
(sad music)

229
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,001
- Turn back, if I ever
meant anything to you

230
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,436
turn back and look at me.

231
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:30,674
Tell me you just made a huge mistake.

232
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:31,507
Aiden!

233
00:13:35,506 --> 00:13:36,339
Aiden?

234
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,033
Aiden?

235
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,464
Aiden, I love you!

236
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,966
(alarm ringing)

237
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,736
(calming music)

238
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,146
- [Mrs. Blackstock] Hello Beth.

239
00:14:19,146 --> 00:14:20,979
- Oh, Mrs. Blackstock.

240
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:23,228
Are you here for the takings,
because I can just go

241
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,061
and get them--

242
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,093
- No no uhm, stay where
you are, there's something

243
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:28,834
I want to discuss with you.

244
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,641
- Discuss, oh God is it to do with the guy

245
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:35,076
that came last week, Matt
somebody, because I swear

246
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:36,990
that he was a student after a job.

247
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,562
If I had known that
he'd had anything to do

248
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,792
with CineFlex, I would've
definitely gotten him a coffee.

249
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,792
- No Beth it's not that.

250
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:48,313
Beth, our cinema has not
been performing as well as

251
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,812
expected over the last year.

252
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:52,543
- No no I know that,
but we can get it back,

253
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,855
I know we can, and I've actually
had some really good ideas

254
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:57,383
which I've made a note of in
my book, and I can show you

255
00:14:57,383 --> 00:14:59,568
that now, if you would like.
- No thank you.

256
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:02,469
- Okay so what about, a loyalty scheme.

257
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,611
You know watch five
films and get one free.

258
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:08,118
- Model our cinema on the
supermarket, no dear no,

259
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:10,652
that, that wouldn't do it at all.

260
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,544
- Well it works for them, and
I know it could work for us

261
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,233
if we just tried it.

262
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:17,400
No okay, no fine, not loyalty schemes.

263
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:20,579
Theme night, theme night.

264
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,303
We could show Eurovision,
people love that kind of thing

265
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:24,957
especially in Brighton,
and people could come to

266
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,546
the cinema all dressed up
with their friends and fans,

267
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:29,236
I know it would generate
loads of interest.

268
00:15:29,236 --> 00:15:33,076
- No Beth these ideas are much
too modern for this cinema.

269
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,807
- No, no it's not, they'd fit right in.

270
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:39,649
- I'm sorry Beth, I'm selling the cinema.

271
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,748
- No, no you can't sell it to CineFlex.

272
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:46,327
- It'll be fine Beth,
Matt Jones has promised me

273
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:49,016
that they'll respect this place's history,

274
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:52,187
and they'll invest money in
trying to make it better.

275
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:53,300
- And you believe that.

276
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,885
- I'm sorry Beth, I've got no choice.

277
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,299
- Oh but...

278
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,678
What could I say, in just 24
hours I'd lost my boyfriend

279
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:05,444
and I was now about to
lose my job, what next?

280
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:06,726
So that's, that's it?

281
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,302
You're just gonna sell the
cinema and we're gonna just

282
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,585
lose our jobs?

283
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:13,099
- There is some hope,
there's a management position

284
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:16,441
available for someone
who has been working here

285
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,299
for more than two years.

286
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,274
- I'll take it, I've
worked here for six years,

287
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:22,582
so you just tell him that
I will have that job.

288
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,747
- All right Beth, I'll tell
Matt Jones to let you know

289
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:29,445
when the interviews are going to be.

290
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:30,695
Thank you Beth.

291
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,440
For all you've done.

292
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:45,110
- Balls.

293
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,453
(weeping)

294
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:57,766
(upbeat music)

295
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,173
(muttering)

296
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,317
- Of course...

297
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:16,524
Beth, oh...

298
00:17:19,718 --> 00:17:22,135
Look, here, some more drinks.

299
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:29,994
- I just, I just miss
him so much, you know me,

300
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:34,161
and I, (mumbling), but I just
so want him back so much!

301
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,761
- Really?
- Yeah!

302
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:39,285
- Why don't you just watch
some of these bloody romcoms

303
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:42,322
you like, that'll put
a smile on your face.

304
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,503
Something where Gosling
takes his shirt off.

305
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:48,634
What about that, that stupid crazy--

306
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,402
- Crazy, Stupid, Love.
- Exactly, that one!

307
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,755
We can (mumbling) over those abs.

308
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:57,444
- Do you know, I'm just, I'm
just not in the mood for Ryan.

309
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:58,694
- Hey, hey now!

310
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,729
Let's not say anything
we're gonna regret now okay.

311
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,983
- Yeah I know, I mean,
you know what I mean.

312
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,233
- Yeah.
- But you know what?

313
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:10,822
He doesn't love me, so what am I gonna do?

314
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:14,162
- Honestly, honestly?

315
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:14,995
Forget about him.

316
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:19,148
- Yeah but I don't wanna forget
about him, I want him back!

317
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:20,960
- I thought you'd say that.

318
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,793
- What is wrong with me, you know?

319
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,586
- Nothing, nothing.

320
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:30,382
Just like Bridget
(mumbling), you're perfect

321
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:31,422
just the way you are.

322
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:33,859
- Well Aiden obviously
didn't think that, did he?

323
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,634
- That's because he's a raving dickhead.

324
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,241
- Is he?
- What, he is!

325
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,147
Look you deserve way better than him.

326
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:41,835
- Well you know what he said that too.

327
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,613
- Beth, you're well rid of him.

328
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,860
- Well that's the point
though, I don't wanna be rid

329
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
of him, I want him back.

330
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:52,368
Please Lizzie help me.
- How?

331
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:56,539
- Well tell me how I can be hotter.

332
00:18:58,312 --> 00:18:59,793
- What?

333
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,725
- Well you know you can be
like one of those people

334
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,866
on a TV show where your
entire job is to make me look

335
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:06,366
like a total babe.

336
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:08,810
- Huh?

337
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,863
- You know think, think She's All That.

338
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:13,822
- What the hell is She's All That?

339
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:17,528
- Really, Rachael Leigh
Cook, Freddie Prinze Jr.

340
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:19,708
- Has anyone told you that
you watch too many movies.

341
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,032
- Oh please Lizzie.

342
00:19:22,032 --> 00:19:23,615
- Fine, fine, fine.

343
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:34,149
Well, I mean, you are a little pale.

344
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,350
- Okay a bit of take tan then.

345
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,433
- Yeah, yeah.

346
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,087
And your hair.

347
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:46,611
I mean it's just...

348
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,117
It's kinda...

349
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,404
And you really, really
should learn how to use

350
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,332
a hairdryer Beth.

351
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,165
- Lizzie!

352
00:19:58,056 --> 00:19:58,889
- Too far?

353
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:02,398
- Well no, no carry on.

354
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,292
- Look Beth you don't
need to do this you know,

355
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,902
it's not right you
changing the way you look

356
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:06,995
for bloody Aiden.

357
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:09,171
- No I'm not, I'm not.
- Really?

358
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:10,338
- Yes!
- Hmm...

359
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,347
- No.
- Uh-huh.

360
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,964
And well don't you think it's a bit soon,

361
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:19,727
I mean it's only been a day.

362
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:22,789
- Please Lizzie you gotta help me.

363
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,372
- Fine, fine, fine.

364
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:32,133
But first you must abide
by the two-week rule.

365
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:35,185
- I abide, I abide, what
is the two-week rule?

366
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:37,246
- I will tell you.

367
00:20:37,246 --> 00:20:39,913
But you're not going to like it.

368
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,637
- [Matt] Hello, Granddad?

369
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:53,312
- What?
- Open the door!

370
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,645
(muttering)

371
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:02,469
- Matt!
- Hiya Granddad.

372
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,313
- Matt, if it isn't my
least-loved grandson.

373
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:08,577
Hey listen, I thought you'd
forgotten all about me.

374
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:09,837
- Fat chance.

375
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,274
- Well look are you gonna come in?

376
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:14,449
Or are you gonna stand out
there like some bloody prat eh?

377
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:16,866
- Charming.
- All right, yeah.

378
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:23,611
- Men, respond to distance, not words.

379
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:28,999
If you've got any hope of getting
him back, you need to give

380
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:33,241
him time to realise that
he has made a mistake.

381
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,394
Sending him a bunch of texts
telling him how much you miss

382
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,393
him is only gonna scare him off, you need,

383
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:41,893
to maintain an air of mystery.

384
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:47,946
So what we need to do is
implement the two-week rule.

385
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:51,323
Where you do absolutely nothing.

386
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,656
- Nothing.
- Hmm-mm, nothing.

387
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:58,721
Two weeks, you are forbidden
to contact him Beth.

388
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:02,024
- Forbidden, that's a
little bit strong isn't it?

389
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:04,857
- It felt like a forbidden moment.

390
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:06,669
- Okay.

391
00:22:08,563 --> 00:22:12,152
- Do you think the reason
I'm 30 and still single

392
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:15,245
is because I keep running
away from commitment.

393
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:17,318
(coughing)

394
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:18,485
You all right?

395
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:26,455
- I'll be, oh, stop slapping
me on the bloody back.

396
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:29,038
- Sorry, you okay?
- Oh God yes.

397
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,563
I was just taken a bit back
from your question you know.

398
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:38,380
In my day, we left all
that mushy stuff to women.

399
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,503
- Sorry, yeah, forgot I said anything.

400
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:42,253
- All right, tell me.

401
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:45,198
How's business.

402
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,424
- Same as usual, working hard as always,

403
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:51,025
CineFlex are taking over a
new theatre on London Road.

404
00:22:51,025 --> 00:22:55,224
- Oh the one on London Road,
oh God I do love that cinema.

405
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:57,149
Oh and that lovely girl who's there, Beth,

406
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:59,706
that's her name, Beth Beth.

407
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:02,190
She always, you know sorts me
out with a nice cup of tea,

408
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,919
you know, yes.

409
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,586
Eh, she's very pretty isn't she.

410
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,470
- I don't really know
her, seems nice though.

411
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,470
- And you know, Blondie?

412
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:15,754
- We split up.

413
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:16,671
- You sp...

414
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:18,659
Oh, right.

415
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:21,761
Another one?

416
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:23,862
- Another one.
- Yeah?

417
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,054
- No.
- Yes.

418
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,659
Well you know, okay, listen.

419
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:27,933
You're not getting much younger you know,

420
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,583
and I'd like to see you
settled in with a nice girl,

421
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:32,383
before I sort of you know toddle off.

422
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:34,437
- I'm very happy as I am, thank you.

423
00:23:34,437 --> 00:23:36,377
- Oh yeah you'd be a
bloody sight happier mate

424
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:38,106
if you had the love of a good woman.

425
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:39,134
- Yeah and a bullet in the brain.

426
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,749
- Oh come on don't give me all that crap,

427
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:42,606
of all your friends
and all the rest of it.

428
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:46,013
Come on listen I know
you, right I know you.

429
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:49,154
You need the love of a good woman.

430
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:51,210
Listen in my day you got
married, that was it.

431
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,142
Better or for worse, none
of this running away.

432
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,166
No, Blondie, what's her name?

433
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,924
- Alice.
- Alice, right, Alice.

434
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,705
Now I'm right, right?

435
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:03,596
She was very fond of you wasn't she?

436
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:05,585
- Yeah.
- Now listen.

437
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,779
I don't know why you broke
up, listen I don't care

438
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,030
why you broke up but I
wanna tell you one thing.

439
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,314
Very difficult to find
a woman who loves you

440
00:24:12,314 --> 00:24:14,383
in this world, they're
not 10 a penny you know,

441
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:18,092
and I should bloody well
know that I tell ya.

442
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:21,607
Look all right, you know my
eyesight, it's not very good.

443
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:25,992
But listen I can tell you're
not happy, no you're not.

444
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:29,828
Look tell me something, why
don't you give Alice a call,

445
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:32,560
yes, no, listen, right,
ask her out to dinner.

446
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,874
See if you can sort something
out over a nice, you know,

447
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:37,069
glass of wine.
- No I don't know.

448
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:40,152
- Oh come on, give the girl a chance.

449
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:44,021
Now listen if you don't wanna
do it for you, do it for me.

450
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:45,787
You've seen the signs on
the road, Help The Aged,

451
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:47,402
well that's me, I'm the aged.

452
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,402
You help me all right mate, come on.

453
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:54,609
(upbeat music)

454
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,686
- Read the affirmation
every night and then again

455
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,849
every morning when you get up.

456
00:26:03,849 --> 00:26:06,956
I'd also like you to do it
aloud in front of the mirror--

457
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,234
- (throat scraping) Beth.

458
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,040
I need you in the bathroom,
time to pluck those brows.

459
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,594
- We're busy Elizabeth.

460
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:17,281
- I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.

461
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:19,698
- Actually no, I'm not sorry.

462
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:24,462
See, I came to speak to Beth, not you.

463
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:26,545
- Beth is busy.
- Really?

464
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,367
Because she looks pretty bored to me.

465
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:31,749
- There is no need to be rude.

466
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:33,117
- You can talk.

467
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:35,555
- [Mother] What's that supposed to mean?

468
00:26:35,555 --> 00:26:37,064
- You are always rude to Beth.

469
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:39,763
- You abandoned her to go gallivanting off

470
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:42,284
with any Tom, Dick or Harry
and then just expect her

471
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:46,451
to rescue you and you get stuck
in a bloody toilet window.

472
00:26:48,312 --> 00:26:50,540
- You told your mom about that?

473
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,025
- Yeah but only because she asked me how

474
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:53,831
me and Aiden met and it kind of--

475
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:57,211
- Fine, I got stuck in the toilet.

476
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,810
But at least I'm not a bully.

477
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,573
- A bully, how dare you call me that!

478
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:03,267
- Yeah come on Lizzie
you can't, you can't call

479
00:27:03,267 --> 00:27:05,766
my mom a bully.
- Well she is a bully!

480
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:08,014
You're bullying Beth to
go to Australia with you,

481
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:10,454
she doesn't want to go.

482
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:11,371
- Oh I see.

483
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,160
I get what this is all about.

484
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,515
You're afraid of losing
the person who picks up

485
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:19,040
all the pieces when you mess up.

486
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,030
- Mom come on you can't,
you can't talk to her

487
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,782
like that, she has been a really
good friend to me as well.

488
00:27:23,782 --> 00:27:26,753
- I have, and that is why I'm
giving her this make-over,

489
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,847
because we're great friends,
and I want her to be happy.

490
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,276
- Why do you think I'm helping
her with this business plan.

491
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:33,218
I've agreed that she doesn't have to come

492
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,984
to Australia with me if she gets this job.

493
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:37,310
Whether you believe it or not,

494
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,695
the only thing I want from my
daughter, is her happiness.

495
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:41,528
- Fine.

496
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:44,078
At least we agree on one thing.

497
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,245
- Fine.
- Fine!

498
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:48,799
- Uhm sorry guys, I know
this is probably a bad time

499
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,525
but I've got a question.

500
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:52,277
- [Both] What?

501
00:27:52,277 --> 00:27:56,106
- When was I supposed to wash the tan off?

502
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:56,939
- Shit.

503
00:27:58,044 --> 00:28:01,044
(upbeat rock music)

504
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:12,207
- Are you okay?

505
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:15,207
- Do you know what I've been better.

506
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:18,822
- Is it your liver or something?

507
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:21,491
- Liver?

508
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,792
- I mean is that why you're that colour?

509
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:28,422
- Oh my God is it really that bad?

510
00:28:28,422 --> 00:28:31,397
I knew Lizzie was lying,
I'm orange aren't I?

511
00:28:31,397 --> 00:28:33,508
- So you're not ill?
- No!

512
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:36,316
- Oh, that's a good thing right?

513
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:40,278
- Yeah it's a good thing
that I look ill and I'm not.

514
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:44,111
- Uh yeah, I'm just here
to measure things up.

515
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:48,156
- [Beth] Measure up what exactly?

516
00:28:48,156 --> 00:28:50,993
- Oh you know just
dimensions, ceiling heights,

517
00:28:50,993 --> 00:28:53,663
that kind of thing, just to
get a rough idea of costings

518
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,640
you know, doesn't have to be exact,

519
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,973
the contractors can do that.

520
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:03,403
- You okay?

521
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:08,419
- Yep, just got away from
me for a second there.

522
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:09,642
- What would you wanna change anyway,

523
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:11,541
this cinema is perfect.

524
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,938
- Oh there's no such thing as perfect.

525
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:17,363
- There is, it's between these four walls.

526
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:19,262
Did you know this is the
oldest working cinema

527
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:22,591
in the whole of the UK, it's
not just a pile of bricks

528
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:26,719
and cement, it's a
living, breathing theatre.

529
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:28,793
Do you have any idea the number of people

530
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:31,403
that get lost in here,
it's not just a place

531
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,797
where you can come and watch a film,

532
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:36,072
it's a place where for two
hours you can completely

533
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:39,699
become someone else, and just forget about

534
00:29:39,699 --> 00:29:43,116
all the crap in your life and just smile.

535
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:46,906
This cinema is priceless.

536
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:53,577
I'm gonna go and do a stock take.

537
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:55,843
Be careful with that tape measure.

538
00:29:55,843 --> 00:29:58,843
(upbeat rock music)

539
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:33,587
- Jesus fucking Christ,
what happened to your face?

540
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:35,950
- Oh don't say a word.

541
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,507
- I only need one word, I'm just not sure

542
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:40,809
which one best describes how you look.

543
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,509
- What are you doing here
Carl you're not even working.

544
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,165
- I know, I just popped
in to see if you're going

545
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:47,486
on Saturday night?

546
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:50,463
- What is Saturday night?
- Proud.

547
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:52,653
- Why would I be going to Proud?

548
00:30:52,653 --> 00:30:56,562
- For Aiden's engagement party of course.

549
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:57,812
- What?
- Oh...

550
00:30:59,412 --> 00:31:01,885
Did you not know about it?

551
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:05,302
Well, she's a lovely girl, Fi's her name.

552
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:10,686
Bumped into her and Aiden the other night.

553
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:13,353
Blond, pretty, massive tits too.

554
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:21,534
Yeah, God, everyone who's anyone is going.

555
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:27,674
Oh, well you're not obviously,
anyone that is (mumbling).

556
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:36,439
You're out Beth, you
look a little bit peaky?

557
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:42,030
Is there such a thing
as a peaky (mumbling)?

558
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:46,356
Well, I'd better shut off.

559
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:52,190
I still need to get them
an engagement present.

560
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:55,434
Laters.

561
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:12,904
- [Alice] Hi Matt.

562
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:14,389
- Alice you're here.

563
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:16,282
- Uhuh, yeah!

564
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,282
- [Matt] Hi.

565
00:32:19,108 --> 00:32:20,509
- Good to see you.

566
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:23,314
- And you, glad you could come.

567
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:24,219
Your hair's brown.

568
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:27,381
- Oh yeah I changed it, it's kinda sexier.

569
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:30,068
A bit more darker, it's matches yours.

570
00:32:30,068 --> 00:32:32,401
His and hers hair?
- Yeah...

571
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:35,404
Do you wanna sit down?

572
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:38,866
- I'll just pull out my own chair.

573
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:41,283
- Yeah.
- I'm kidding.

574
00:32:41,283 --> 00:32:44,224
- Sorry, I should've, yeah.

575
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:47,280
- I was just playing with you.

576
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,706
- I've already ordered
a nice bottle of red.

577
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:52,956
- Good, great, thank you.
- Yeah, okay.

578
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:55,824
So what would you like to eat?

579
00:32:55,824 --> 00:33:00,249
- Pork belly for main and
oysters to start, to share.

580
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:03,631
- Do you know what, I'm
okay, I'm not the biggest fan

581
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:04,464
of seafood.

582
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:06,362
- Oh Matt come on, it would be romantic.

583
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:08,540
- I can't really I...
- Go on!

584
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,373
- Oh, here's the wine.

585
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,216
- Well I need to try it first.

586
00:33:18,216 --> 00:33:19,049
It's okay.

587
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:28,992
Yeah it's cool.

588
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:41,386
Thanks, she's gorgeous isn't she?

589
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,484
- Oh I didn't notice.

590
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:45,401
- She had massive tits.

591
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:50,686
Why are you acting so weird?

592
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:52,943
- I'm not.

593
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,595
- Is there someone else you wanna be with

594
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:57,280
or somewhere else you wanna be?

595
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,192
Do you wanna be with the
waitress, just kidding.

596
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:04,359
- I was just thinking, do
you know what, forget it.

597
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:07,389
So, what are you having?

598
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:09,329
- I already said I'm having the pork belly

599
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,244
and we are having the oysters.

600
00:34:12,244 --> 00:34:13,077
- Okay...

601
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:21,347
- Are you sure about this?

602
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:22,180
- Yep!

603
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:25,623
- How do you even know
you're gonna get in?

604
00:34:25,623 --> 00:34:27,997
- Well I don't really.

605
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:32,164
- Okay, so let's just say
you've charmed your way in,

606
00:34:33,544 --> 00:34:34,377
what then?

607
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:39,487
- I'm not exactly sure.

608
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:42,537
- Right, so lemme get this straight,

609
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:46,053
you are going to gatecrash Aiden's party,

610
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:49,553
his engagement party, and you have no idea

611
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,495
how you're gonna get in,
or what you're gonna do

612
00:34:52,495 --> 00:34:56,088
when you get there.
- Pretty much yeah.

613
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:59,399
- Do you want me to stir, are you nervous?

614
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,232
- No.
- That's so cute.

615
00:35:02,989 --> 00:35:04,906
I'll start.
- After you.

616
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,973
- Well, you can just watch me and learn.

617
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:39,799
Swallowed.

618
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:46,646
Go on your turn.

619
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:03,531
- So I?
- Yeah just, knock it back.

620
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:18,469
Oh for God's sake, just swallow it.

621
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:28,516
Fuck's sake.

622
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:38,895
Oh my God...

623
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,487
Are you gonna give me
something to wipe it off of me?

624
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:46,320
- Sorry.

625
00:36:51,347 --> 00:36:54,680
- Oh my God.
- I am really, really sorry.

626
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:59,342
- Everyone is looking at me.
- It, it's fine.

627
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,611
I think it might've been an
allergic reaction in here.

628
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:04,585
- I cannot believe I've
sat here and really thought

629
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:07,352
that you were serious about
us getting back together.

630
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:10,114
I cannot believe I've fallen for it.

631
00:37:10,114 --> 00:37:11,829
- Alice you didn't fall for anything.

632
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,925
But please sit down.

633
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:15,564
- What causing a scene
am I, well fuck you Matt,

634
00:37:15,564 --> 00:37:19,731
I'm not standing around here
to be humiliated by you!

635
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,470
Oh, had all that lovely
wine and I didn't give you

636
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,303
anything for it, how's that, dick.

637
00:37:30,537 --> 00:37:31,370
Dick!

638
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:44,081
- [Beth] I'm not gonna lie,
the two bottles of wine

639
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:46,445
had given me a newfound confidence,

640
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:49,014
and I only meant to have
a couple of glasses,

641
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:52,706
God, how did I get my life so wrong?

642
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:55,539
(soft rock music)

643
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:07,380
- Oh, Beth!

644
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,612
What are you gonna do now.

645
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:14,294
- Oh don't worry about me, I
know exactly what I'm doing.

646
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,832
- Of course, you'll do great.

647
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:18,665
(soft rock music)

648
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:32,958
- Oh sorry.

649
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:57,079
- Everyone, ladies and gentlemen,

650
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,065
a little hush if you please.

651
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:02,665
Ladies and gentlemen I
am absolutely delighted

652
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,928
you could all be here tonight, on this,

653
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,360
the happiest of occasions.

654
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,098
As many of you know.
- Twat.

655
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:10,993
- This night has been a long time coming,

656
00:39:10,993 --> 00:39:14,881
and shrouded in secrecy
for obvious reasons.

657
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:17,022
But before we go to the main announcement,

658
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,660
there's someone I'd like you all to meet.

659
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,077
Mommy, Daddy, Granny, Gramps.

660
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,929
I take great pleasure
introducing you to someone

661
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,974
you thought you'd never get to see.

662
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:30,724
Everyone, this is Fi.

663
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:34,530
(applauding)

664
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:41,445
Beth.

665
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:46,233
- Surprise.

666
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,838
- What are you doing?
- Let me take that.

667
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:52,690
I'd like to say a few
words if that's okay.

668
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,857
So today is a really happy
day, a very, very happy day.

669
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:02,494
But the truth is, the truth is that,

670
00:40:03,907 --> 00:40:06,422
it's actually a really sad day.

671
00:40:06,422 --> 00:40:09,610
A very very sad day
indeed because, because,

672
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,791
well you've all been lied to.

673
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:16,958
Yeah and I, Beth Prince, I'm
here to tell you all the truth.

674
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,917
- Beth?
- Look stop it, stop it.

675
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,642
Stop pretending to everyone
that you're a nice guy.

676
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:24,829
- Beth I can explain!
- No shush, shush.

677
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:25,662
You!

678
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:31,645
This man, this man is a liar, and a cheat.

679
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:39,233
And, and he's been making love,
shagging the hell outta me.

680
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:47,308
And all the time he's been
pretending to be in love

681
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:50,684
with that woman.
(gasping)

682
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:53,543
Exactly, I probably
should chop his head off,

683
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:56,092
and I probably should off her head too.

684
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:58,562
But you know what, I'm not gonna.

685
00:40:58,562 --> 00:41:01,676
Because I may be a lot of things,

686
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:04,259
but a murderer just is not one.

687
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,336
And so now, that man,

688
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:12,126
is going to marry that woman,

689
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:16,798
and I just feel like, it's, it's my duty,

690
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:19,457
to, to, to expose him

691
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:25,919
for the cheat and the
liar that he really is.

692
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:29,012
So there you go ladies and gentlemen,

693
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:32,640
Aiden Dowles is a
complete and utter, what!

694
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,080
- No one's getting married here.

695
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,211
It'd be quite wrong if Aiden
and Fi we're getting hitched.

696
00:41:39,211 --> 00:41:40,044
- Exactly.

697
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:41,544
- They're cousins.

698
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:47,314
- Cousins?

699
00:41:47,314 --> 00:41:51,481
- And Fi here has flown in
specially for my 50th birthday.

700
00:41:56,302 --> 00:41:58,302
- Your birthday.
- Yeah.

701
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:02,874
- Carl!

702
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:13,178
Happy birthday Dad.

703
00:42:13,178 --> 00:42:15,761
(upbeat music)

704
00:42:21,228 --> 00:42:23,061
- Wow, happy birthday!

705
00:42:27,114 --> 00:42:29,447
(sad music)

706
00:42:35,297 --> 00:42:36,130
- Beth?

707
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:40,184
Beth?

708
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:43,905
Beth is that you?

709
00:42:47,073 --> 00:42:51,415
What are you doing out
here, you must be freezing.

710
00:42:51,415 --> 00:42:52,748
Here, take this.

711
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:57,926
Are you okay?

712
00:42:59,314 --> 00:43:01,064
- You should go Matt.

713
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:02,911
- Why?

714
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:10,202
- Because I'm a loser.

715
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:12,426
- No you're not.

716
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:14,400
- I am.

717
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:16,674
- Why?

718
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,125
- Because I gatecrashed a
50-year-old's birthday party

719
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:24,708
and then made a complete
tit out of myself.

720
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,606
- I bet you didn't.

721
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:29,455
- Oh I did.

722
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:34,066
- Well then I'm sure that it
wasn't as bad as you think.

723
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:34,899
- It was.

724
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,284
- Oh yeah, well I bet
you didn't accidentally

725
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:41,608
spit an oyster in someone's face.

726
00:43:41,608 --> 00:43:43,584
- You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

727
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:45,584
- No, right in the face.

728
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:49,545
(laughing)

729
00:43:50,768 --> 00:43:52,018
- That's funny.

730
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:55,075
- She didn't think so.

731
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:09,211
- Do you ever wish that you
could rewind your life Matt?

732
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:12,717
- All the time.

733
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,340
- Life is messy, love is messier.

734
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:27,805
- Who said that?

735
00:44:27,805 --> 00:44:31,480
- Jennifer Garner, Catch and Release.

736
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,423
- I don't think I saw that one.

737
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:38,090
- I think I might've
been the only that did.

738
00:44:44,951 --> 00:44:46,118
So go on then,

739
00:44:48,464 --> 00:44:50,964
tell me what happened tonight.

740
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:57,041
Why did you spit an
oyster in a girl's face.

741
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:01,507
- Long story short, I went out for dinner

742
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:05,317
with an ex to see if we
should give things another go,

743
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:08,325
and things didn't quite
go according to plan.

744
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:10,020
In fact things went so far off plan,

745
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:14,187
that they made a plan of their
own and then by the time I...

746
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:16,346
Beth?

747
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,017
(calming music)

748
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:58,540
- [Lizzie] Coffee!

749
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,389
(groaning)

750
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:04,455
Oh you look bloody gorgeous.

751
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:05,455
- Oh my God.

752
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,307
Please tell me that I did
not try and snog my potential

753
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:11,640
boss last night.

754
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:14,985
- You were in no state
to kiss your own hand,

755
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:16,934
let alone him.

756
00:46:16,934 --> 00:46:19,707
I've never seen you so drunk.

757
00:46:19,707 --> 00:46:21,550
Or (mumbling) for that matter.

758
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:25,473
- Yeah but I hit it,
tell me I hit it right?

759
00:46:25,473 --> 00:46:27,056
- Yeah, eventually.

760
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:32,196
After you puked in the
bath, and the kitchen sink,

761
00:46:32,196 --> 00:46:34,578
ah huh, you might wanna take (mumbling)--

762
00:46:34,578 --> 00:46:38,745
(growling)
(coughing)

763
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,232
- Oh my God I am never
ever drinking again.

764
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:46,343
- Patties for breakfast.

765
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:49,809
(growling)
(coughing)

766
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,343
Sorry.

767
00:46:51,343 --> 00:46:54,010
(calming music)

768
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:04,793
- [Beth] It had taken us
five hours on a minibus

769
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:08,339
to get to Swansea, and the
only thing I knew about Wales,

770
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:11,006
was that it was bloody freezing.

771
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,378
- Hi everbody, firstly, I'd like to say

772
00:47:17,378 --> 00:47:19,777
thank you all for coming,
especially those of you

773
00:47:19,777 --> 00:47:22,394
who aren't fans of leadership weekends.

774
00:47:22,394 --> 00:47:24,497
Hopefully it won't be as bad as you think.

775
00:47:24,497 --> 00:47:26,515
Now I know that there's
only one management position

776
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:28,871
available, but I still hope
that everyone takes something

777
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:30,650
out of the weekend anyway.

778
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,720
And as you know, it's gonna
be a mixture of group classes

779
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,529
and some one-on-one interviews.

780
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:36,682
So if everyone would like
to grab a bit of lunch,

781
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:40,182
change into your track suits,
and I'll see you shortly.

782
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:44,349
- Track suit, I don't even
own a bloody track suit.

783
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:47,645
Have you got an alpha I can borrow?

784
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:50,062
(rock music)

785
00:47:53,888 --> 00:47:56,493
- Okay so we're gonna
do some warmup exercises

786
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:58,442
to get us all ready for
the rest of the day,

787
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,279
and I'm gonna hand it over to Bob.

788
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:01,901
He's gonna lead the exercises.

789
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,234
- Okay everbody!

790
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:05,755
Repeat after me!

791
00:48:06,645 --> 00:48:08,228
Bananas, attention!

792
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,470
I said, repeat after me.

793
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:26,565
Bananas, attention!

794
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:31,369
- [Group] Bananas, attention!

795
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,917
- Better, better.

796
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,456
Now go bananas!

797
00:48:57,865 --> 00:48:59,578
(cloth tearing)

798
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:02,214
(laughing)

799
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:04,047
- [Carl] Banana split!

800
00:49:06,895 --> 00:49:09,661
Banana split.
- Shut up Carl.

801
00:49:09,661 --> 00:49:10,994
Here, take that.

802
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:12,942
Are you okay?

803
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:16,312
- I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.

804
00:49:16,312 --> 00:49:19,729
- Okay uhm, just carry on Bob, it's good.

805
00:49:21,452 --> 00:49:23,202
- Bananas, attention!

806
00:49:24,701 --> 00:49:27,951
(electronic pop music)

807
00:49:45,498 --> 00:49:48,165
(phone ringing)

808
00:49:51,147 --> 00:49:53,980
- [Man] You have two new messages.

809
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:58,199
- [Mom] Hello darling,
how did the interview go,

810
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,892
I'd love you to get it, but
you know how I keen I am

811
00:50:00,892 --> 00:50:05,188
for you to join me in
Australia, let me know.

812
00:50:05,188 --> 00:50:08,345
- [Man] Message deleted, next new message.

813
00:50:08,345 --> 00:50:11,246
- [Aiden] Hey Beth, it's Aiden.

814
00:50:11,246 --> 00:50:12,862
Look I wanted to talk to
you about what happened

815
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:15,337
the other night, I dropped by your flat

816
00:50:15,337 --> 00:50:18,385
but Lizzie said you'd gone away?

817
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:20,239
Where are you?

818
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:21,989
Please, call me back.

819
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,647
- [Man] Message deleted.

820
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:03,739
- Matt?

821
00:51:05,347 --> 00:51:07,680
Matt it's Beth are you okay?

822
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,070
- Beth.

823
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:19,118
- Hi.

824
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:22,315
- Come in.

825
00:51:28,447 --> 00:51:30,006
Would you like a drink?

826
00:51:30,006 --> 00:51:30,839
- Sure.

827
00:51:40,856 --> 00:51:42,773
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

828
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,753
- You can sit down if you like.

829
00:52:14,984 --> 00:52:18,817
- We missed you at dinner,
is everything okay?

830
00:52:20,843 --> 00:52:23,485
- My granddad had a heart attack.

831
00:52:23,485 --> 00:52:26,235
- [Beth] Oh God, is he all right?

832
00:52:27,286 --> 00:52:31,827
- He's still alive, which
is a good thing, right?

833
00:52:31,827 --> 00:52:35,031
Apparently he's heavily sedated.

834
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:37,538
It just sucks that I'm stuck
here while he's all alone

835
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:39,199
in the hospital.

836
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,227
- The doctors will look after him.

837
00:52:41,227 --> 00:52:42,310
- Yeah, okay.

838
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:47,115
Thanks Beth.

839
00:52:50,288 --> 00:52:53,100
For checking I was okay.

840
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,872
- No problem.

841
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:58,470
I was just, I mean, we
were just a bit worried.

842
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,436
- Yeah, I imagine the boys
are (mumbling) to the booze

843
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:05,019
just fine without me.
- You could say that.

844
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:10,490
- It's nice to talk to someone.

845
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,323
- Is it?

846
00:53:12,924 --> 00:53:16,257
- Yeah, it's not until something happens

847
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:20,992
to the one person in the
world that you really love,

848
00:53:20,992 --> 00:53:23,991
that you realise how alone you are.

849
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:26,051
- You're not alone.

850
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:27,384
- Aren't I?
- No.

851
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:30,064
I mean I don't know who you've got,

852
00:53:30,064 --> 00:53:34,881
but you must have so many
people that care about you.

853
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:37,233
- Do you know what?

854
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:42,102
My granddad says you were
kind, and he was right.

855
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:44,575
You're a very special Beth,

856
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,675
none of the others would've
thought to check up on me.

857
00:53:47,675 --> 00:53:49,784
- How did he know I was kind?

858
00:53:49,784 --> 00:53:52,262
Had he been to the cinema or something?

859
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:56,429
- Yeah, it seems you made
quite an impression on him.

860
00:53:57,995 --> 00:54:00,328
He said you were pretty too.

861
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:02,122
- Oh.

862
00:54:03,394 --> 00:54:05,061
- What's the matter?

863
00:54:07,023 --> 00:54:08,773
Beth, hey look at me.

864
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:14,835
You are pretty.

865
00:54:16,763 --> 00:54:18,680
Don't you believe that?

866
00:55:05,846 --> 00:55:08,212
(phone ringing)

867
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:11,206
- [Beth] Shit, sorry, sorry!

868
00:55:11,206 --> 00:55:13,065
- Oh that's you.

869
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:14,398
- Uhm, just a...

870
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,125
- Who is it?

871
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:20,875
- Uhm, no one, no one,
it's just complicated.

872
00:55:21,966 --> 00:55:23,250
I think I need to go.

873
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,027
- No, you don't have to go.
- Sorry I need to leave.

874
00:55:25,027 --> 00:55:27,167
Thank you, thank you, sorry.
- Beth!

875
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,084
Beth, Beth!

876
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:53,456
Granddad?
- Yes it's Granddad.

877
00:55:53,456 --> 00:55:56,548
Oh well if it isn't my
least-loved grandson.

878
00:55:56,548 --> 00:55:58,819
I thought you had forgotten all about me.

879
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:00,760
- Oh so you're the grandson,

880
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,249
I've heard a lot about you.

881
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:04,201
- He's been telling you
all my secrets has he?

882
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:07,341
- Now I wouldn't say that, but
I have heard a few stories.

883
00:56:07,341 --> 00:56:09,320
I'll be back to check up on
you in half an hour okay?

884
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,785
- Not if I can't get you first, love.

885
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,986
- Promises, promises.

886
00:56:12,986 --> 00:56:16,363
- All right then, come on, get in.

887
00:56:16,363 --> 00:56:18,272
Oh dear, dear, dear.

888
00:56:18,272 --> 00:56:19,645
- So how are you feeling?

889
00:56:19,645 --> 00:56:21,895
- How am I feeling, I feel,

890
00:56:22,903 --> 00:56:25,141
like I've punched in the heart.

891
00:56:25,141 --> 00:56:27,243
- I'm really sorry that I wasn't there.

892
00:56:27,243 --> 00:56:28,793
If I hadn't been in
Wales, if I'd been here--

893
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:30,941
- No, there's nothing you could've done.

894
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:34,113
I mean come on stop
talking like a bloody prat.

895
00:56:34,113 --> 00:56:35,727
- Well I've been thinking.

896
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:37,113
Maybe I should move in.

897
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:40,024
- What move in with me?
- And I'll look after you.

898
00:56:40,024 --> 00:56:44,191
- Are you joking, I would rather
have another heart attack.

899
00:56:45,815 --> 00:56:47,195
- So what did the doctors say?

900
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,756
- What did the doctor say?

901
00:56:48,756 --> 00:56:52,339
He said, I've gotta
stop me nightly tipple,

902
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:55,520
my sex life has gotta come to an end,

903
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,600
I've told all the women
you know, God did they cry.

904
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,279
And, ah yes, yeah, I
gotta start taking drugs.

905
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,112
- Drugs?

906
00:57:04,112 --> 00:57:07,354
- Yeah, LSD last night, XTC tonight.

907
00:57:07,354 --> 00:57:08,254
- Yeah very funny.

908
00:57:08,254 --> 00:57:11,780
- Hey I'm rather looking
forward to it actually.

909
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,947
Hey listen no look, you got
a little glow about you.

910
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:22,105
Oh, yeah got a bit of totty
did you in Wales did you?

911
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:24,262
- Totty?

912
00:57:24,262 --> 00:57:26,075
- Well come on talk to me,
it's not exactly buzzing

913
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:28,461
with bloody conversation
here is it, is it?

914
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:32,259
Who then, I know, oh come
on, it was Blondie wasn't it?

915
00:57:32,259 --> 00:57:34,842
- No, not Alice.
- No, who then?

916
00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:41,250
Oh come on, don't tell me you
don't know her bloody name.

917
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,238
- It was Beth.

918
00:57:42,238 --> 00:57:45,205
- Beth, Beth, you mean cinema Beth?

919
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:48,872
Cinema, oh good on you,
she is a keeper son!

920
00:57:49,962 --> 00:57:53,066
- Yeah anyway, would
you like a (mumbling)?

921
00:57:53,066 --> 00:57:56,443
- Oh God yes I would,
listen, if you're gonna go

922
00:57:56,443 --> 00:57:58,638
downstairs, would you go
and get me one of those

923
00:57:58,638 --> 00:58:02,805
fruit bars and a sandwich
because, the food here is shit.

924
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,211
(laughing)

925
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,443
- Bacon and egg?

926
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:11,526
- Oh, I would kill for bacon and egg.

927
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,906
- Coming up.
- Okay lad.

928
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:28,539
- [Beth] Matt?

929
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,633
- Beth?

930
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,897
What are you doing here?

931
00:58:33,897 --> 00:58:36,566
- I don't actually know really.

932
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:38,727
But I brought a card.

933
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,144
- I can see that.

934
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:43,705
- It's for your granddad.

935
00:58:44,674 --> 00:58:48,341
- Right oh, uhm, he'll
love that, thank you.

936
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,842
He'll really appreciate it.

937
00:58:53,505 --> 00:58:56,929
- Right I need to talk
to you about last night.

938
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:58,258
- Okay.

939
00:58:58,258 --> 00:59:00,030
- The phone call that I
got, it wasn't anything--

940
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:00,863
- It's fine.

941
00:59:00,863 --> 00:59:03,317
- No, no it's not, and I'm sorry,

942
00:59:03,317 --> 00:59:04,725
I shouldn't have run off.

943
00:59:04,725 --> 00:59:07,752
- Really I'm sure we'll
laugh about it one day.

944
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,393
And on the plus side I'm
pretty sure none of my ribs

945
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:10,588
are actually cracked.

946
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,690
- Oh my God I forgot about that.

947
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,334
- It's all right, sex-related injuries

948
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:16,700
happen to the best of us.

949
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,867
Come on, let's go and see the old man.

950
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:24,633
He's just in here.
- Oh hello!

951
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:28,800
Hey look, it's that lovely
girl from the cinema, Beth eh?

952
00:59:30,448 --> 00:59:31,609
- I got you a card.

953
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:35,076
- You got me a card, oh isn't that nice?

954
00:59:35,076 --> 00:59:36,341
You really shouldn't have done!

955
00:59:36,341 --> 00:59:37,663
- Oh it's nothing.
- Really.

956
00:59:37,663 --> 00:59:40,271
Let me have a look at it, oh that,

957
00:59:40,271 --> 00:59:43,339
lots of love, Beth, I mean she loves me.

958
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:45,049
I've never had a get well soon--

959
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,557
- I'll put it over here.

960
00:59:46,557 --> 00:59:49,312
- Thank you very much, oh, thank you,

961
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:52,469
I'll eat this after what they call dinner.

962
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:54,032
- [Matt] All right.

963
00:59:54,032 --> 00:59:56,042
- Thank you very much.

964
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:58,875
So then Beth Beth Beth Beth, I uh,

965
01:00:01,442 --> 01:00:05,237
I hear you had a bit of fun
with my grandson last night.

966
01:00:05,237 --> 01:00:06,771
- Granddad!

967
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:08,110
- Well what's the matter,
what's the matter,

968
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,051
we're all adults here aren't we?

969
01:00:10,051 --> 01:00:11,634
- Yeah, definitely.

970
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:16,657
- So you know Beth, let me
tell you something about life.

971
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:19,367
(calming music)

972
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:21,598
- [Beth] Matt's Granddad
was a real sweetie.

973
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,460
He told me all about his late
wife and how much he loved her

974
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,437
he didn't give a shit
about reality TV, fashion,

975
01:00:27,437 --> 01:00:30,322
or Botox and he happily told me why.

976
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:32,508
He would raise his eyebrow
at the end of every sentence

977
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:34,112
which made me giggle.

978
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:36,496
He laughed easily and unselfconsciously

979
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:39,001
just like his grandson.

980
01:00:39,001 --> 01:00:42,334
I could see why Matt adored him so much.

981
01:00:43,317 --> 01:00:44,250
- Yes.
- I'm off.

982
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,243
- Oh, are you off my boy.
- Yeah.

983
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,113
- Oh!
- But I'll come back tomorrow.

984
01:00:48,113 --> 01:00:50,926
- Yeah, oh yeah, yeah son.

985
01:00:50,926 --> 01:00:51,759
Come here.

986
01:00:55,657 --> 01:00:57,574
Be healthy eh, healthy.

987
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:09,835
- [Matt] Good night.

988
01:01:12,995 --> 01:01:17,162
- [Woman] The vain thing
isn't really real you know.

989
01:01:20,224 --> 01:01:21,807
And don't forget...

990
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,096
- [Both] I'm also just a girl.

991
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:29,597
Standing in front of a boy.

992
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,387
Asking him to love her.

993
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:40,163
(phone ringing)

994
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:43,212
- [Man] You have one new message.

995
01:01:43,212 --> 01:01:46,106
- [Mom] Hi honey, it's your mom here.

996
01:01:46,106 --> 01:01:48,969
So I haven't heard from you,
so I guess things didn't

997
01:01:48,969 --> 01:01:51,533
go so well and you didn't get the job.

998
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:54,367
I'm sorry honey, but I think it's probably

999
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:57,603
for the best, so the
flight's on Christmas Eve,

1000
01:01:57,603 --> 01:02:01,287
just over two weeks away, write it down,

1001
01:02:01,287 --> 01:02:04,302
it's time you forgot about
that stupid film obsession

1002
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:08,530
of yours and start a-fresh,
I'll see you soon darling,

1003
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:12,748
and only bring one suitcase,
maximum weight 20 kilos.

1004
01:02:12,748 --> 01:02:15,731
Love you!
(door knocking)

1005
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:16,564
- Coming.

1006
01:02:21,844 --> 01:02:23,418
Matt.

1007
01:02:23,418 --> 01:02:24,251
- Hey.

1008
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,003
- Are you okay?

1009
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:30,836
- Yeah uhm, sorry, I
shouldn't have come here.

1010
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:35,348
- Did you wanna come in,
you must be freezing.

1011
01:02:35,348 --> 01:02:37,577
- Maybe just for a bit, if that's okay.

1012
01:02:37,577 --> 01:02:40,632
- Yeah of course it is, ah
but one condition though.

1013
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:43,299
(calming music)

1014
01:02:58,847 --> 01:03:01,899
Um, how did you know where I live?

1015
01:03:01,899 --> 01:03:03,879
- I gave you a lift back in a taxi,

1016
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:05,987
the night we met on the seafront remember?

1017
01:03:05,987 --> 01:03:07,154
- Right, yeah.

1018
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:12,389
- Well this is a long shot,
but are you a fan of romcoms

1019
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:13,952
by any chance?

1020
01:03:13,952 --> 01:03:16,015
- Well yeah, yeah you could say that.

1021
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:19,281
- And let me guess, Hugh
Grant is your ideal man?

1022
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:21,473
- Well obviously I love
him, but I wouldn't say

1023
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:23,710
that he's my ideal man, I mean,

1024
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:25,737
I'd probably take his
personality in Notting Hill

1025
01:03:25,737 --> 01:03:28,363
but then I'd Ryan Gosling's body

1026
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:30,863
and young Richard Gere's face.

1027
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:33,912
- That'd be a weird-looking guy.

1028
01:03:33,912 --> 01:03:36,470
- Okay what about you, what
about your perfect woman?

1029
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,026
- I'd probably go with Angie's legs,

1030
01:03:39,026 --> 01:03:42,003
Scarlett's boobs, and bum,

1031
01:03:42,003 --> 01:03:43,503
and Monroe's face.

1032
01:03:44,402 --> 01:03:46,919
- And what about personality?

1033
01:03:46,919 --> 01:03:49,637
- Natalie Portman, yeah,
but she'd have to have

1034
01:03:49,637 --> 01:03:51,534
a dirty side to her too.

1035
01:03:51,534 --> 01:03:52,367
- Oh...

1036
01:04:00,944 --> 01:04:01,890
- Can I use the bathroom.

1037
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,660
- Sure yeah, yeah it's just down the hall.

1038
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:04,493
- Okay.

1039
01:04:08,982 --> 01:04:12,982
- Oh my God.
(calming pop music)

1040
01:04:19,516 --> 01:04:21,266
Oh yeah, smells good.

1041
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:28,700
Come on!

1042
01:04:31,673 --> 01:04:33,423
- What are you doing?

1043
01:04:40,882 --> 01:04:42,534
- Too desperate?

1044
01:04:42,534 --> 01:04:44,887
- Why are you talking to
yourself in the mirror,

1045
01:04:44,887 --> 01:04:47,720
you never normally do this do you?

1046
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:55,605
Oh she might think I'm having a shit.

1047
01:05:05,374 --> 01:05:06,207
Candles.

1048
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:11,717
- Uhm yeah it's just makes it smell nice.

1049
01:05:11,717 --> 01:05:12,834
- Oh I wasn't--

1050
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:15,229
- No no no, no it wasn't for that,

1051
01:05:15,229 --> 01:05:17,729
it was just, God I am nervous.

1052
01:05:19,234 --> 01:05:22,234
- Good, because I'm shitting myself.

1053
01:05:23,243 --> 01:05:24,076
- Why?

1054
01:05:25,738 --> 01:05:28,155
- Because I kind of like you.

1055
01:05:30,884 --> 01:05:31,717
- Kind of?

1056
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:34,374
- Yeah.

1057
01:05:36,189 --> 01:05:37,761
- Are you drunk?

1058
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:38,594
- No, you?

1059
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:43,936
- I'm a little bit pissed.
- How many have you had?

1060
01:05:43,936 --> 01:05:47,353
- One or two glasses, maybe three by now.

1061
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,145
Maybe I should?

1062
01:05:50,145 --> 01:05:52,978
- No, wow that was a desperate no.

1063
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:59,067
- Well you did light a candle, so.

1064
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:00,951
- There's so much stuff
that's messed up in my life

1065
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:04,256
at the moment and there's
one thing that I know

1066
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:06,987
I'm 100% certain of.

1067
01:06:06,987 --> 01:06:09,956
And that's that I don't want you to leave.

1068
01:06:09,956 --> 01:06:11,373
- [Matt] Why not?

1069
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:13,820
- I just...

1070
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:17,622
I just...

1071
01:06:19,053 --> 01:06:20,636
- [Matt] Just what?

1072
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,650
(romantic music)

1073
01:07:25,422 --> 01:07:26,255
- Matt?

1074
01:07:28,474 --> 01:07:30,057
- Go back to sleep.

1075
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,425
(sad music)

1076
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:20,090
- Matt?

1077
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,757
(phone ringing)

1078
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:27,237
Matt?

1079
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:31,652
- [Sheila] Oh hi Beth, this is
Sheila, I'm Matt's colleague.

1080
01:08:31,652 --> 01:08:32,485
- Oh, hi.

1081
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,527
- [Sheila] I'm sorry to
the bearer of bad news,

1082
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:37,795
but I'm afraid to say you
didn't get the manager's job,

1083
01:08:37,795 --> 01:08:39,212
I'm really sorry.

1084
01:08:40,975 --> 01:08:43,058
- Oh okay, is Matt there?

1085
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,105
- Uh yeah just a second.

1086
01:08:48,105 --> 01:08:51,235
She wants to speak to
you, what shall I say?

1087
01:08:51,235 --> 01:08:53,792
- That I never wanna see here again.

1088
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:56,698
- [Sheila] Sorry Beth, I'm
afraid Matt's in a meeting.

1089
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,715
He did say to tell you that
you'll work your notice

1090
01:08:58,715 --> 01:09:00,823
until the end of December,
and you'll be paid

1091
01:09:00,823 --> 01:09:03,343
your finally salary on
your last working day.

1092
01:09:03,343 --> 01:09:05,857
Oh and uhm, if you need a reference,

1093
01:09:05,857 --> 01:09:07,712
I shall speak to Mrs. Blackstock.

1094
01:09:07,712 --> 01:09:08,545
- Okay.

1095
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:10,633
Thanks.

1096
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:13,716
(sad, calming music)

1097
01:09:28,353 --> 01:09:29,634
Ahem.

1098
01:09:29,634 --> 01:09:31,774
- Sorry can I get two tickets
for It's a Wonderful Life

1099
01:09:31,774 --> 01:09:32,607
please.

1100
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:35,527
- Oh what's so wonderful about it?

1101
01:09:35,527 --> 01:09:37,182
- Sorry?

1102
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:38,015
- Nothing.

1103
01:09:39,706 --> 01:09:40,956
Enjoy the film.

1104
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,307
(phone ringing)

1105
01:09:48,446 --> 01:09:50,878
- Hi Beth, I understand
why you're ignoring me

1106
01:09:50,878 --> 01:09:54,546
but we really need to talk,
please call me as soon as

1107
01:09:54,546 --> 01:09:55,629
you get this.

1108
01:10:19,156 --> 01:10:23,705
Do you know what, you
look beautiful tonight.

1109
01:10:23,705 --> 01:10:25,274
Actually radiant, and
you're not orange which

1110
01:10:25,274 --> 01:10:26,607
is a good thing.

1111
01:10:28,587 --> 01:10:31,391
That said, I'd probably still love you

1112
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:35,391
if you were (mumbling) coloured.

1113
01:10:39,014 --> 01:10:39,847
- Okay...

1114
01:10:42,626 --> 01:10:44,129
Okay no no no stop stop
wait, Aiden, Aiden.

1115
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:45,420
- Sorry, I shouldn't
have gone for the boobs,

1116
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,253
it's just I love them so much--

1117
01:10:46,253 --> 01:10:47,199
- [Beth] No Aiden, stop
look at me, look at me.

1118
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,205
- You're just so sexy, and--

1119
01:10:48,205 --> 01:10:49,157
- Look at me!

1120
01:10:49,157 --> 01:10:51,960
You just said, you'd
probably still love me

1121
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,604
even if I were (mumbling) coloured.

1122
01:10:54,604 --> 01:10:56,783
- Well yeah I would.

1123
01:10:56,783 --> 01:10:58,072
- I don't want probably.

1124
01:10:58,072 --> 01:10:59,060
- It was just a joke.

1125
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,838
- No no I don't jokes either.

1126
01:11:00,838 --> 01:11:03,486
You said the word love.

1127
01:11:03,486 --> 01:11:04,486
- Well yeah.

1128
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:07,340
I love you Beth.

1129
01:11:11,427 --> 01:11:13,010
Is everything okay.

1130
01:11:14,098 --> 01:11:17,765
- I don't think we
should get back together.

1131
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:20,166
- Oh.

1132
01:11:22,064 --> 01:11:25,744
- Uhm, I mean I think it was unfair of me

1133
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:30,066
to say that I'd give
it another go with us.

1134
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:33,149
I was really confused and I am sorry.

1135
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:36,169
But I think you were
right to break up with me

1136
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:38,477
when you did, because
I was just pretending

1137
01:11:38,477 --> 01:11:40,310
to be someone I'm not.

1138
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:44,067
I'm going to Australia.

1139
01:11:45,048 --> 01:11:46,965
I'm sorry, I'm leaving.

1140
01:11:49,128 --> 01:11:52,128
I'm moving to Australia with my mom.

1141
01:11:53,525 --> 01:11:54,525
- Oh, uhm...

1142
01:11:58,462 --> 01:12:01,129
Well I guess this is good night.

1143
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:07,411
- I think this is a bit
more than good night.

1144
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:11,813
(sad romantic music)

1145
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:57,297
- You're going, aren't you?

1146
01:12:57,297 --> 01:12:58,130
- Yeah.

1147
01:13:07,448 --> 01:13:10,115
(phone ringing)

1148
01:13:17,068 --> 01:13:17,901
- Hello.

1149
01:13:20,904 --> 01:13:21,737
Speaking.

1150
01:13:25,987 --> 01:13:27,487
Are you all right?

1151
01:13:30,363 --> 01:13:31,530
I'm on my way.

1152
01:15:44,677 --> 01:15:47,344
(sad pop music)

1153
01:16:20,883 --> 01:16:23,216
What the fuck are you doing?

1154
01:16:35,239 --> 01:16:37,359
Mrs. Blackstock is Beth working today?

1155
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:38,380
- Beth?
- Yeah Beth!

1156
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,410
Is she working today?

1157
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:41,600
- I'm afraid not.

1158
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,260
- Fuck!

1159
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:45,366
- Matthew Jones!

1160
01:16:45,366 --> 01:16:48,788
- I'm sorry, I just really
needed to speak to her.

1161
01:16:48,788 --> 01:16:51,445
- [Mrs. Blackstock] Is everything okay?

1162
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:53,962
- I'm afraid not, no.

1163
01:16:53,962 --> 01:16:55,905
I've been a bit of an idiot.

1164
01:16:55,905 --> 01:16:58,085
- Oh I'm sure it's nothing
that a good old fashioned

1165
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:00,198
apology can't put right.

1166
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:02,198
- I wouldn't be so sure.

1167
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:08,720
- Do you love her?

1168
01:17:10,691 --> 01:17:11,900
- What?

1169
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:15,361
- [Mrs. Blackstock] Do you love her?

1170
01:17:15,361 --> 01:17:19,278
- Uh, I don't know, I
mean I think she's great.

1171
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:23,327
But, love, well, that's a big word.

1172
01:17:25,696 --> 01:17:28,450
- I beg to differ it's quite a small word,

1173
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:31,533
just four small letters, taken apart,

1174
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:36,015
they don't mean anything
but put them together

1175
01:17:36,015 --> 01:17:39,897
and it's the most magical
feeling in all the world.

1176
01:17:39,897 --> 01:17:42,654
I knew as soon as I met my husband

1177
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:45,571
that I loved him with all my heart.

1178
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:51,063
How do you feel when you look at her?

1179
01:17:55,178 --> 01:17:56,845
There's your answer.

1180
01:17:59,896 --> 01:18:03,280
- I should've made Beth
manager of this place.

1181
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,977
She had some great ideas,
she could've turned this

1182
01:18:04,977 --> 01:18:06,040
around in six months.

1183
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,074
- I'm sure she could but she's quit.

1184
01:18:09,074 --> 01:18:10,143
- [Matt] Quit?

1185
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:12,234
- [Mrs. Blackstock] Oh
she left a while ago.

1186
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:14,052
- Where'd she go?

1187
01:18:14,052 --> 01:18:16,567
- [Mrs. Blackstock] Off
Down Under apparently.

1188
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:19,067
She had her suitcase with her.

1189
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:22,240
- So, so she's gone?

1190
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:28,991
- [Mrs. Blackstock] I
think she's gone for good.

1191
01:18:41,103 --> 01:18:44,020
- I can't believe I messed this up.

1192
01:18:51,736 --> 01:18:54,319
- Do you believe in faith Matt?

1193
01:18:59,546 --> 01:19:00,546
- I used to.

1194
01:19:01,481 --> 01:19:03,148
- So what's changed?

1195
01:19:05,081 --> 01:19:06,164
- I met Beth.

1196
01:19:07,267 --> 01:19:10,184
- And that made you stop believing?

1197
01:19:14,168 --> 01:19:15,835
Oh, ah, there we go.

1198
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:19,747
- No, it made me happy.

1199
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:25,656
And a happy man doesn't need faith,

1200
01:19:25,656 --> 01:19:28,906
because he's already got what he wants.

1201
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,040
- I think I know how to cheer you up.

1202
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,290
How about a free ticket for the movies.

1203
01:19:37,946 --> 01:19:39,516
- What's playing?

1204
01:19:39,516 --> 01:19:42,863
- It's a Wonderful Life, what else.

1205
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:45,177
- Of course it is.

1206
01:19:45,177 --> 01:19:49,190
Why not, you can drink
in the cinema right?

1207
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:53,357
- Have as many sherry's as you
like my dear, on the house.

1208
01:20:05,517 --> 01:20:08,497
Don't give up on her Matt.

1209
01:20:08,497 --> 01:20:10,664
It is Christmas after all.

1210
01:20:11,909 --> 01:20:15,242
(upbeat romantic music)

1211
01:21:41,649 --> 01:21:42,925
- [Man] That's a Christmas present for

1212
01:21:42,925 --> 01:21:45,175
a very dear friend of mine.

1213
01:21:46,225 --> 01:21:49,328
- [Child] Look Daddy,
teacher says every time

1214
01:21:49,328 --> 01:21:52,495
a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.

1215
01:21:53,545 --> 01:21:56,462
- [Man] That's right, that's right.

1216
01:21:57,946 --> 01:21:59,196
- What, really?

1217
01:22:00,127 --> 01:22:00,960
- Hi.

1218
01:22:08,308 --> 01:22:09,141
- Hi.

1219
01:22:09,141 --> 01:22:11,474
(sad music)

1220
01:22:15,486 --> 01:22:16,774
- Have you been crying?

1221
01:22:16,774 --> 01:22:18,357
- No of course not.

1222
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:24,442
- Can I see your ticket?

1223
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,411
- [Matt] I don't have one.

1224
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:30,683
- Did you sneak in?

1225
01:22:30,683 --> 01:22:34,100
- No, Mrs. Blackstock let me in for free.

1226
01:22:35,077 --> 01:22:35,910
- She did?

1227
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,223
Why?

1228
01:22:40,337 --> 01:22:42,004
- Because I was sad.

1229
01:22:44,684 --> 01:22:46,966
- Is that why you were crying?

1230
01:22:46,966 --> 01:22:48,466
- I wasn't crying.

1231
01:22:52,137 --> 01:22:53,887
I thought you'd gone?

1232
01:22:54,778 --> 01:22:55,611
- I did.

1233
01:23:01,288 --> 01:23:02,621
But I came back.

1234
01:23:07,604 --> 01:23:08,437
- Why?

1235
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:14,534
- Cameron Diaz, Julia Roberts.

1236
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:18,082
Kate Hudson, they all come back.

1237
01:23:23,494 --> 01:23:25,016
- So who am I?

1238
01:23:25,016 --> 01:23:26,864
- You're the idiot that
has to try and convince me

1239
01:23:26,864 --> 01:23:29,447
that I made the right decision.

1240
01:23:31,195 --> 01:23:32,528
- I am an idiot.

1241
01:23:34,033 --> 01:23:37,366
Fuck no I'm worse than that, I'm a twat.

1242
01:23:38,698 --> 01:23:40,698
- Yeah, you are.
- I am.

1243
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,040
I really am.

1244
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:48,053
You didn't deserve the way I treated you.

1245
01:23:48,053 --> 01:23:50,406
You really didn't deserve that.

1246
01:23:50,406 --> 01:23:53,000
- So then why did you?

1247
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,349
Why did you sleep with
me and then disappear

1248
01:23:56,349 --> 01:23:58,516
and refused to talk to me?

1249
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,530
- Because of the sign.

1250
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:04,530
- What sign?

1251
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,579
- On your bedroom wall.

1252
01:24:08,579 --> 01:24:10,638
- [Beth] What about it?

1253
01:24:10,638 --> 01:24:14,966
- I saw it the morning after
we'd spent the night together.

1254
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:18,216
- I didn't write that sign, my mom did.

1255
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:21,833
- Your mom?

1256
01:24:23,061 --> 01:24:23,894
- Yeah.

1257
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:30,031
- I didn't see that coming,
I thought that you'd had

1258
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:32,231
written it and then the only
reason you'd slept with me

1259
01:24:32,231 --> 01:24:34,795
was to get the manager's position.

1260
01:24:34,795 --> 01:24:39,156
- Did you really think
that I would do that?

1261
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:41,739
- I suppose deep down I didn't.

1262
01:24:44,155 --> 01:24:45,072
I panicked.

1263
01:24:46,986 --> 01:24:50,444
And I could blame my ex for
making me mistrust women

1264
01:24:50,444 --> 01:24:51,861
but the truth is,

1265
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,127
that's no excuse.

1266
01:24:57,307 --> 01:25:00,890
I became the man that
I swore I'd never be.

1267
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:05,357
I was Bridget Jones' Hugh Grant.

1268
01:25:05,357 --> 01:25:06,857
Not Four Weddings.

1269
01:25:08,213 --> 01:25:12,055
- Did you just make a
romcom reference for me.

1270
01:25:12,055 --> 01:25:13,472
- Yes, yes I did.

1271
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,943
You know the job's yours if you want it.

1272
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:26,875
- What?

1273
01:25:28,847 --> 01:25:32,930
- The manager's position
is yours if you want it.

1274
01:25:34,096 --> 01:25:35,929
- Are you joking?
- No.

1275
01:25:39,216 --> 01:25:43,356
You breathe life into this cinema, Beth.

1276
01:25:43,356 --> 01:25:44,439
It needs you.

1277
01:25:47,412 --> 01:25:48,329
I need you.

1278
01:25:55,673 --> 01:25:57,756
I don't have anyone else.

1279
01:26:00,926 --> 01:26:02,593
- Matt what's wrong?

1280
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:06,761
What happened?

1281
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,173
- He,

1282
01:26:17,379 --> 01:26:18,629
he passed away.

1283
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,340
- Oh my God.

1284
01:26:27,868 --> 01:26:29,368
Matt I'm so sorry.

1285
01:26:34,751 --> 01:26:35,834
- You, you...

1286
01:26:38,644 --> 01:26:40,561
- Sorry, what was that?

1287
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:43,870
- You...

1288
01:26:47,396 --> 01:26:50,742
Granddad knew you were the one.

1289
01:26:50,742 --> 01:26:53,825
He saw how nice you are, how special.

1290
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,110
How beautiful.

1291
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:02,054
He told me not let you go and then,

1292
01:27:02,054 --> 01:27:05,887
I let pride get in the
way and I fucked it up.

1293
01:27:08,327 --> 01:27:09,577
And I hurt you.

1294
01:27:13,297 --> 01:27:14,130
I'm sorry.

1295
01:27:18,664 --> 01:27:21,164
I'm sorry for everything Beth.

1296
01:27:24,855 --> 01:27:26,272
Let's just leave.

1297
01:27:29,014 --> 01:27:30,857
- What's this, well that's just it?

1298
01:27:30,857 --> 01:27:33,403
You're just gonna leave?

1299
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:35,052
- What do you mean?

1300
01:27:35,052 --> 01:27:37,635
- This isn't how a romcom ends.

1301
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:43,713
The guy and the girl don't
just go their separate ways.

1302
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,595
- They don't?
- No.

1303
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:49,178
What kind of an ending is that.

1304
01:27:53,705 --> 01:27:55,622
- A shitty one.
- Yeah.

1305
01:27:56,608 --> 01:27:58,275
A really shitty one.

1306
01:28:00,125 --> 01:28:03,125
- So how do you think it should end?

1307
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:08,787
- Well, there's pressure now isn't there?

1308
01:28:10,613 --> 01:28:14,996
I mean we've just had
the whole over-dramatic,

1309
01:28:14,996 --> 01:28:18,379
I'm so sorry I shouldn't
have hurt you I should leave

1310
01:28:18,379 --> 01:28:21,546
speech, and you've got me up on stage.

1311
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:25,915
And I don't even know if
a kiss would be enough,

1312
01:28:25,915 --> 01:28:29,165
it would have to be one hell of a kiss.

1313
01:28:32,603 --> 01:28:34,936
(muttering)

1314
01:28:36,153 --> 01:28:39,653
(cheerful romantic music)

1315
01:28:53,752 --> 01:28:54,835
- I love you.

1316
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:04,178
Sorry, that might've be a bit soon huh?

1317
01:29:05,413 --> 01:29:06,904
I got caught up in the moment, and,

1318
01:29:06,904 --> 01:29:08,638
with being on stage and everything and?

1319
01:29:08,638 --> 01:29:12,026
- Has anyone ever told
you, you talk to much?

1320
01:29:12,026 --> 01:29:15,526
(cheerful romantic music)

1321
01:30:20,401 --> 01:30:24,234
(warm, cheerful, happy music)

1322
01:30:36,269 --> 01:30:39,827
♫ I wanted to say

1323
01:30:39,827 --> 01:30:43,113
♫ All the right things before I said

1324
01:30:43,113 --> 01:30:46,530
♫ All the wrongs instead

1325
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:56,480
♫ Much to your surprise, well I

1326
01:30:57,595 --> 01:31:01,262
♫ I wasn't surprised at all

1327
01:31:09,965 --> 01:31:14,132
♫ Oh, oh, well it's such a beautiful day

1328
01:31:16,467 --> 01:31:20,550
♫ On the other side of the world

1329
01:31:26,202 --> 01:31:29,619
♫ Oh, oh I feel so young

1330
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:36,020
♫ But my soul is so old

1331
01:31:41,899 --> 01:31:46,066
♫ So won't you cut a slice of
your life and hand it to me

1332
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:58,867
♫ Well I don't like phone
sex but if we're on Skype

1333
01:32:00,026 --> 01:32:04,193
♫ I don't mind, seeing a nipple or two

1334
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:15,000
♫ They say the heart
grows fonder with distance

1335
01:32:16,425 --> 01:32:20,592
♫ But that wasn't the case with you

1336
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:32,543
♫ Oh, oh it's such a beautiful
day on this side of the world

1337
01:32:44,617 --> 01:32:48,284
♫ Oh, oh well I am so young

1338
01:32:51,252 --> 01:32:54,585
♫ But my soul is so old

1339
01:33:00,713 --> 01:33:03,130
(vocalising)
