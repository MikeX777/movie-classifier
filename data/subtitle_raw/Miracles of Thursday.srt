1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,660
They see him? Even the humble mail train

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,060
at 6:45 a.m. he goes through this town without stopping.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,900
Of course, this did not happen 50 years ago.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,700
At that time, for an express

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,180
could be called luxury,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,140
it necessarily had to stop at Fontecilla.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,740
What has happened since then?

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,660
Why, as in so many towns in Spain,

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,620
the big expresses only stop when passing by here

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,420
a brief shaking in the pots in the cupboards?

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,100
And yet there are things that have not changed,

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,540
for example, the people of Fontecilla.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,580
They are still waiting for the council to install the new sewer system.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,660
The men still till the same piece of land.

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,540
And the women continue as always with their simple faith

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,220
asking for simple things from heaven.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,780
Rain, for example.

18
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,940
What has changed then?

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,900
What could have happened to make the trains pass by?

20
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,620
The famous Fontecilla spa is simply no longer fashionable.

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,980
Nobody buys their postcards anymore,

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,500
nor drink its calcium-nitrogen waters

23
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,900
that cured everything.

24
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,700
Hear? The good people of Fontecilla are going to rejoice.

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,340
That rain they asked for has not been long in coming.

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,260
The harvest will be better.

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,220
Congratulations.

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,340
But it never rains to everyone's liking.

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,620
And clean water doesn't suit the old spa

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,100
that falls from the sky.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,740
Yes, the spa is nothing more than a ruin.

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,300
And to restore the old prosperity, its owner,

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,940
Don Ramón, he's ready for anything.

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,540
Maybe to cheat with the law

35
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,340
and even worse. Much worse still.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,060
Carmela! What is 11:00!

37
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,700
¡Carmela!

38
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,220
What is 11:00!

39
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,420
-How much force? Half or all? -Half.

40
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,500
Half! For four cats that are ...

41
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,300
Good Morning.

42
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,260
Good Morning.

43
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,180
Luisito! Don't touch the palm tree, you can prick yourself!

44
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,820
-Good. -Remember that it causes tetanus.

45
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,540
-How shall I tell you? -How's the world going, Don Ramón?

46
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,620
Have you already reached the debut of Josefina Baker?

47
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm still in October 17th. This European war is so long ...

48
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,460
How are those of the source of Health?

49
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,140
-A 1.50. -Child, don't touch!

50
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,260
What prices! How is your life!

51
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,620
Come on, write.

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,420
And without staining your fingers!

53
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,340
Dear parents...

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,340
But woman! Write now! How the best places take us

55
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,220
-Well, you'll see. -Do not worry!

56
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,260
They were still calling the waitress.

57
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,140
-Look at these! They are there! Didn't I say it? -We can still reach them.

58
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,900
- Down the hall! -Yeah, come on, come on.

59
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,820
Child, don't drag your feet!

60
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,900
Eugene! Eugenio, come on!

61
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,940
-Come on, I've taken a place for you. - Hurry.

62
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,020
-Its busy. -Oh yeah? Excuse me

63
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,180
-I put a signal! -Not that this was the train.

64
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,620
Postcards, postcards. And my bronchial tubes to get bored.

65
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,140
Silly stuff.

66
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,940
Good...

67
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,060
What do we do? Are we waiting for Dona Paquita?

68
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,180
Get started! Get started now!

69
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,100
Luisito, don't go near the waterfall!

70
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,300
Remember that the Romans made it.

71
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,940
Do you want to separate a little, not letting me breathe?

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,860
-Why don't you turn the horn away? -Come on, Carmela! Gymnastics!

73
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,660
One two.

74
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,140
One two. One two.

75
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,380
-Has it started long ago? -Do not worry.

76
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,860
-It's still on time. -Good...

77
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,700
One two. One,

78
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,060
two. One two.

79
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,300
One, two and three.

80
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,300
-One two. -(SHOUTS)

81
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,220
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

82
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,460
-Coming soon! To the doctor! -Not!

83
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,500
Not the doctor! Don Fidel.

84
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,140
To the priest, I'm dying.

85
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,780
-How? -So,

86
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,380
-Run! -Luisito!

87
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,740
The waterfalls do not touch!

88
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,940
Doña Paquita!

89
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,900
-Doña Paquita! -What's wrong with him?

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,780
That he is dying again.

91
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,420
He has made him dizzy and asks for a confession.

92
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,660
This lady! Dying every day!

93
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,620
-It will end up scaring the water users away. -The poor!

94
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,220
How she is so old and she never wants to admit it!

95
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,220
With that of spas to die at ease ...

96
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,180
Come here to make me Easter!

97
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,420
¿Central?

98
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,100
Central? Get me Don Evaristo right away.

99
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,820
Say it?

100
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,420
Great! You run to church

101
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,180
and notify Don Fidel. I take care of the rest. Right away.

102
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,100
What's up?

103
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,980
Yes Yes.

104
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,420
See you later!

105
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,740
Pedrito has a total of 24 apples.

106
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,220
Writes!

107
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,140
If he gives 12 to his mother and six to his little brother,

108
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,780
How many apples will Pedrito have left?

109
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,340
Stay in silence. Quiet!

110
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,260
(Horn)

111
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,900
Pay me the coffee!

112
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,700
(Horn)

113
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,500
(Horn)

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,340
That lady is a bore!

115
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,220
When something hurts, you already think you are dying.

116
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,100
-I'm just letting you know ... -Yes, I know.

117
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,420
At least last year he died in good weather.

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,700
With an archangel no one would be surprised.

119
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,100
They have appeared so many times ...

120
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,740
And the sword of fire, what? Do you think it is very easy to do it?

121
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,100
It doesn't have to be. Feeling is enough.

122
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,780
A little glitter and ... Leave me the technical details.

123
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,260
I already have it!

124
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,380
Let the archangel Don Ramón, who has studied fencing, do.

125
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,220
Don't you realize that it's outrageous?

126
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,260
What? Appear with a gun in hand.

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,780
People will be scared, man!

128
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,420
¡Oh, miren!

129
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,180
San Roque. What do you think?

130
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,660
Whoops! Great! Great!

131
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,500
It is done! Don Antonio and Sultan!

132
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,460
Neither Don Antonio nor Sultan. But...

133
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,820
You don't play with my dog! (MUG)

134
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,180
These must be the five martyrs of Prague.

135
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,060
Tortured in 112 under Diocletian.

136
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,700
Clear! Five, like you!

137
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,300
They appear in a group and that's it.

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,940
That, and halfway through the apparition,

139
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,380
we sing along for you to have fun. Very pretty.

140
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,740
So then...

141
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,220
so...

142
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,260
Man! San Isidro!

143
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,060
He looks like Don Salvador.

144
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,540
In addition, they say that he is a very miraculous saint.

145
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,420
A nephew of mine fell out of a tree and nothing happened to him.

146
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,980
Yeah, so what? Well that.

147
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,660
Nothing happened to him. Don Antonio can put the springs.

148
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,900
This of San Isidro seems to me a great nonsense.

149
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,900
They would believe that a farmer or someone from the town appeared.

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,940
So do you think that to be a saint you don't have to know anything?

151
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,260
If he is a farmer, because he is a farmer.

152
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,300
And if he is a warrior, because he is a warrior.

153
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,460
So there is no way to make appearances!

154
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,020
Don Antonio calls us.

155
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,820
Come on. What? What happens?

156
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,180
Look, I already found it. Oh yeah? Where?

157
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,900
In the choir. If there is nothing there.

158
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,300
Miren, miren. Miren.

159
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,180
See, who does this face remind you of?

160
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,940
Without the beard, huh?

161
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,140
Hey? Check it out, huh?

162
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Is it him or is it not him? It is done!

163
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,900
It is true! Well of course!

164
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,180
Not! I do not! I do not want! No no no!

165
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,340
There was a man named Dimas.

166
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,620
And another called Gestas.

167
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,980
The two had committed theft

168
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,780
and they were crucified with Christ.

169
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,100
And it said Gestas, the bad thief ... Hey.

170
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,900
Aren't we getting into something too serious?

171
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,820
Look, I am Spanish. Catholic like the most!

172
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,220
Would it be calm if we were offending

173
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,700
to things of the ...?

174
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,020
Well, from the church? We dig too deep.

175
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,780
The consequences are interesting. Do you know what happened in Lourdes?

176
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,540
The miracle water killed the atheists.

177
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,820
And here who is going to know that it is a lie?

178
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,900
Only U.S. If we are careful ...

179
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,500
-Don't make that noise, man! -It's all rusty!

180
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,300
Also, he put that wire where it shouldn't.

181
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,620
Since when did two poles of the same sign join

182
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,500
is doing the wrong thing? Take a look.

183
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,380
(SHOUTING) We're lost!

184
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,460
They've already caught us!

185
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,620
- (SILENCE) - (WHISPER) They hide, they hide!

186
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,900
-Half strength or full strength? -Half! Half!

187
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,740
Be careful with Dona Paquita, don't go near the waterfall!

188
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,860
Well, we don't win for scares.

189
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,140
Fortunately, tourists will soon come to give us their money.

190
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
And what tourists! Tourists with scapular

191
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,540
willing to pay whatever it takes to see Don José appear.

192
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,180
Thousands and thousands! They will have to stay somewhere, eh, Don Ramón?

193
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,380
Cut your hair and shave.

194
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,900
You can sell that batch of rancid oil

195
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,860
that he has not been able to place anyone.

196
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,940
To Don José, as will San Dimas,

197
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,140
they will surely give you alms. How much?

198
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,300
Wasn't there a gold rush in California? This will be the fever of ...

199
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,220
of the miracle. Well I have fun

200
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,900
But I do not believe it. Why?

201
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,900
Because people will not return here even if we invent a movie miracle.

202
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,380
That is what I say. Don Evaristo is right.

203
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,980
The miracles in the cinema.

204
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
And what a favor we are going to do to religion with the birria de santo.

205
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,860
And so bad! I, at least, would not convert.

206
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,740
With this birria de santo, whoever I want converts.

207
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,780
If you are not interested, you go home in peace.

208
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,940
If I say it is for the impression at first sight,

209
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,900
but I think with the help of the azure blue,

210
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,100
we will be able to achieve top quality effects

211
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,980
And these records will help a lot.

212
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,780
Do I have the right to choose music?

213
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,420
By showing up, I think so.

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,540
Which do you prefer? I do not care!

215
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
It was to know.

216
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,780
Very good. There are other more important points.

217
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,340
For example...

218
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,900
For example, where will we do it?

219
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,380
Do I have the right to choose a site? Well, say where and we'll see.

220
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,740
Around the apple trees there is a very sheltered area.

221
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,540
Protest! That land is yours. And that?

222
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,460
He wants to take advantage to do the miracle.

223
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,260
Well, we don't go anywhere like that.

224
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,820
Let us form a commission to study the issue of the land.

225
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,220
It could be you two

226
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,980
and chaired by Don Ramón. Agree.

227
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,580
What is the second point? The most important.

228
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,700
The peseta has disappeared!

229
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,060
It has flown through the air! It has flown!

230
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,020
You believe me? I play a peseta and poof! It disappears.

231
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,660
But you are a very good boy.

232
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,620
The best in school. If you want, the peseta will return.

233
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,020
You have to ask the little angels. You want to?

234
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,180
So we do like this ...

235
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,700
(BLOWS)

236
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,940
(LAUGHS) Look! He's back!

237
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,500
Here I have the peseta, the peseta has returned!

238
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,380
- (LAUGHING) -Yes sir. Great!

239
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,300
Do you want me to disappear again?

240
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,420
Look. Look. Look.

241
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,260
¡Uy!

242
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,980
I rub against my elbow ...

243
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
The peseta is gone!

244
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,060
Look! Flying!

245
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,180
Oops, how it flies. I see her.

246
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,940
He's with the little angels!

247
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,100
Be careful, it falls from your neck, Don Salvador.

248
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,660
And this is the unhappiest kid in school?

249
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,780
Anyone make you believe that Don José ...

250
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,180
We will strengthen your trust in the supernatural

251
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,100
through chemistry. This will make a great impression on you.

252
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,140
Hala, you can go. No, no, no, kid.

253
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,740
You stay You and I are going to do a very good thing.

254
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,180
You will like it.

255
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,700
You see, when children are good, miracles can happen

256
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,780
and you have the face of being very good.

257
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,020
Take a good look and pay close attention. This is water

258
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,460
pure water.

259
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,420
Do you want it to become wine?

260
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,980
Me? No sir.

261
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,620
Not worth. You have to say yes.

262
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,700
(NODES) Yes.

263
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,340
So, say an Our Father.

264
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,980
If you pray an Our Father, God will do the miracle.

265
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,620
You, Reza.

266
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,300
Do as Don Evaristo says, Pepito. Come on

267
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,780
- (PRAY QUICKLY) -Amen.

268
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,460
Now I mix the water in the two glasses, take a good look,

269
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,620
and that's it, here is the wine.

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,220
But yes...

271
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,740
The point is that...

272
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,860
As it is not that the bisulfite is of national manufacture ...

273
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,780
I don't know what the hell ...

274
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,940
You haven't prayed devoutly enough, stupid!

275
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,180
Tomorrow you will write to me 200 times "I don't know how to pray the Lord's Prayer."

276
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
I can't pray the Lord's Prayer! Go away!

277
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,980
My terrain is better because it is higher.

278
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,460
But it does not pay contribution.

279
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,580
Very well, I will not pay a contribution, but on my farm there is no relevant.

280
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,980
When we enter mine

281
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
start to get cool? Clear!

282
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,500
Come on! As if the clouds when they pass over them say:

283
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,900
"Watch out! We are at Don José's farm!

284
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,580
We're going to hail elsewhere! "What nonsense!

285
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,140
It is not about hail, but about relente.

286
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,220
And the cold gives me a cough.

287
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,860
What would people say of a saint who cannot cure a cold

288
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,540
with so many years in heaven? What would be said of a saint

289
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,340
who appears in a farm that does not pay the contribution?

290
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,940
That is also true.

291
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,940
Look, behind the spa there is ... Man, very nice.

292
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,460
Now you want to take advantage of yourself. Don Salvador is there.

293
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,700
-What, Don Ramón? Was there an agreement? -No way!

294
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,860
Well, we can't find anyone. So, we are ready!

295
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,500
Anyway, it was a shame.

296
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,580
Where are you going? Wait. Still.

297
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,260
We could be one of us.

298
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,140
If I say that I saw San Dimas, they will believe me by force.

299
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,860
I am the official chronicler of the town.

300
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,420
Man, that takes an innocent soul and you ...

301
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,060
It seems to me that I have the solution!

302
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,140
Down at the halt, don't you see a man by the tracks?

303
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,980
We had all forgotten Mauro.

304
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,420
-Everybody! -Ah! It is true!

305
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,180
Mauro, from the station? But it is silly!

306
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,860
Yes, silly, silly, but maybe he recognizes me

307
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,820
Yes, poor Mauro.

308
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,780
Always expect a miracle.

309
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,700
And finally it will.

310
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,780
Does not wake up. Insist.

311
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,180
Yes I go.

312
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,460
Plus.

313
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,100
The brake is already released. Let's push.

314
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,820
Come on, come on.

315
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,700
It is done. Come on.

316
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,180
Yes.

317
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,580
We are already here.

318
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,500
Courage, don't worry. Everything will be fine.

319
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,700
Without leaving the tracks.

320
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,420
Come on, Don José.

321
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,660
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

322
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,500
Be careful not to drop it.

323
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,020
Hey, those cables can't go there.

324
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,580
Why? Because there is induction.

325
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,420
The electric field suffers.

326
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,020
To suffer. I have to hold them.

327
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,540
My electric field sabotages me.

328
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,740
If you fail me later, take the consequences.

329
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,420
Without leaving their grounds. Don't leave without this.

330
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,060
It's very important. Not the palm tree.

331
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,580
Pricking.

332
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,980
No palm tree, but go now.

333
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,500
Come on.

334
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,980
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

335
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,580
Nerd. You are going out.

336
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,740
I'm not the mayor for a reason. What if I get stung by a wound?

337
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,660
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

338
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,140
Still!

339
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,140
Without leaving the track.

340
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,980
Music.

341
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,660
Dammit. Right to the balcony.

342
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,860
(Music)

343
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,860
What do you think? Evil.

344
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,580
If we do everything this way, we will fail.

345
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,660
He's stepping on my cabbages.

346
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,980
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

347
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,500
And the others to annoy her.

348
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,300
You bastard!

349
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,020
Music.

350
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,980
(Music)

351
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,340
I am San Dimas.

352
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,500
The ancients called the good thief.

353
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,940
Oh, listen to you. Oh

354
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,020
Hear the word of blessed Dimas.

355
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,140
Since you were the chosen one

356
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,860
by divine mercy.

357
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,340
(SHOUTS)

358
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,180
By divine mercy ...

359
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,860
You have forgotten everything.

360
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,140
I will help you. Well, well.

361
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,860
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

362
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,100
That ... this ...

363
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,420
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

364
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,540
Listen you. Listen you. Listen you.

365
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,500
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

366
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,700
But who has done that savagery?

367
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,100
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

368
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,180
Don José does not know a word.

369
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,420
Listen to me, Mauro, I'm Dimas.

370
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
It is that nothing is seen.

371
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,940
But I tell you that man is not alone in this uncertain hour

372
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,500
and dark. My will ... my will ... I don't hear.

373
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,780
What does it say? In this day.

374
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,380
In this day. Yes Yes.

375
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,700
Oh, on this day.

376
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,100
You and those who receive my testimony

377
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,340
fulfill the mandate of San Dimas.

378
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,340
First of all, you should go ... I'll agree to appear.

379
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,580
Yes, come, brother, everyone.

380
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,580
How does it end, man?

381
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,620
Spaniards and foreigners, come and trust.

382
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,420
Consuming the miracle water

383
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,940
of the Fontecilla hot springs will be cured

384
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,420
all your ills and alleviated all your misfortunes.

385
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,420
This has been my mandate. Bear witness to him.

386
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,580
(SCREAMS) Miracle, miracle!

387
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,060
(SCREAMS) Miracle, miracle!

388
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,300
All wake up, listen to me!

389
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,340
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

390
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,500
- (THEY TALK AT THE TIME) -Me, me!

391
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,900
Wake up all of you and hear me. It will come every Thursday.

392
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,580
He wears a crown and stars are falling. Don't you want to believe me?

393
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,900
We have to go pray there. I'm going to tell everyone.

394
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,020
(Bells)

395
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,140
-You've gone mad? -San Dimas.

396
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,820
I have seen San Dimas. You have to make a sanctuary.

397
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,860
He has told me to tell everyone so they can see him too.

398
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,660
That's silly! Get out of here!

399
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,620
It will come every Thursday. She wears a cloak and a talking palm tree.

400
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,940
-And the music plays. -On the street.

401
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,580
So what do priests believe in?

402
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
-San Dimas will punish him! -On the street!

403
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,860
I don't want drunk people here.

404
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,500
It was true, it was true. I have seen him.

405
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,220
I was San Dimas and I have seen him.

406
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,060
-He will punish them all. -You're drunk.

407
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,180
-Yes to everyone. -Go to sleep.

408
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,620
He has told me, he has told me that he is coming back.

409
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,420
Hear me Come with me to pray.

410
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,060
-Idiot! -He will punish them all.

411
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,980
They ignore him.

412
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,780
Never mind. We will insist.

413
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,020
Otherwise he saw this San Dimas and got drunk,

414
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,500
-But if you don't drink. -It could have been something.

415
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,500
-Anything but a miracle. -Why don't you take it out?

416
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,660
It is not good to have him in this corner.

417
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,140
It is true. We had forgotten it.

418
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,980
Look, here, next to Saint Nicholas.

419
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,460
No, no, it takes away your sight.

420
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,500
We can leave you by the door. It is where it has always been.

421
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,420
And now with what happened to Mauro, maybe he got bad votes.

422
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,540
Don't talk to me about Mauro. Here, which is seen from the entire church.

423
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,100
As he is the good thief, perhaps he turns the one who always steals.

424
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,420
Then we cover the table with some curtains

425
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,900
and a bedspread and we have the base ready.

426
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,940
At least with this we remember San Dimas.

427
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,060
And to me that this is a familiar face.

428
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,300
Why am I going out if Mauro already knows the message?

429
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Today he will perform for Mauro and for someone else. Take a look.

430
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,020
Here is the poor man. Here it is, here it is.

431
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,620
Let's sit.

432
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,300
Give me your chair.

433
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,980
Your halo, Don José.

434
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,540
Total, for two old women.

435
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,620
Couldn't we just skip this Thursday? You promised to show up today

436
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,580
and it appears or I break it ... But, man, today I have a phlegm.

437
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,820
That's nothing, if you saw me in the morning as I wake up.

438
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,340
Okay, I'm going out, but not talking, huh?

439
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,500
That then we start with the sanctuary ...

440
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,140
Don't be silly, man. Don't you see that something needs to be said?

441
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,340
But can't we mail it?

442
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,020
Be careful, someone is coming.

443
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,500
Ah, he's a drunkard.

444
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,060
Matías. Matías the bailiff.

445
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,740
Ah, now, there are four. Sorry, five.

446
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,020
Counting me? No, telling me.

447
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,580
and as I am the chronicler of the town, no one will be surprised

448
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,020
behold the miracle.

449
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,580
Clear. See you later, gentlemen.

450
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,140
By order of the mayor,

451
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,580
it is made known that San Dimas is going to appear.

452
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,460
Praise the Lord.

453
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,100
His holy will always be done.

454
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,780
I don't want to die now after seeing you

455
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,700
and understand how much we have left to do as good Christians

456
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,500
here in the earth.

457
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,860
Yes, of course, of course, but you don't die,

458
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,300
you will bury us all, dona Paquita.

459
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,540
I wish that way I would have time to organize

460
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,980
the most holy arch-brotherhood of San Dimas

461
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,820
and the miracle water, as he personally requested.

462
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,780
-Yes, sure, sure. -You know, Don Fidel?

463
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,780
There is the turn of the pharmacy.

464
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,420
They are almost 15 hard.

465
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,340
Take them for the cult of San Dimas.

466
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,660
I take them for the poor.

467
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,060
For the record, accepting them does not mean that I approve

468
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,540
what you call a miracle.

469
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,540
Oh, Don Fidel, how do you know that you were not up there last night?

470
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,340
Ask Carmela.

471
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,060
Carmela saw the end nothing more.

472
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,620
-Well, yes, he would learn a lot. -The poor.

473
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,180
What country do we live in? If this water were miraculous,

474
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,500
Wouldn't we know? That we have been drinking it since the Romans.

475
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,420
It will be necessary to drink it entrusting to San Dimas, I say.

476
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,140
Well, entrust yourself to San Dimas, drink it, and see what happens.

477
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,620
But I'm just saying ...

478
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,300
Come on, this water is carbonated, calcicalnitrogenated,

479
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,580
And now also miraculous, do you see?

480
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,300
In my spa and miraculous.

481
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,660
What, Carmela? How about?

482
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,220
Yes, sir, and if you now put a golden ornament on it ...

483
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,580
Oh, a little gold ornament.

484
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,980
Come on, how good. Did I say put it on, Don Ramón?

485
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,700
But in a provincial capital,

486
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,980
Who is in the same printers as in Madrid?

487
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,140
A little golden ornament, what nonsense.

488
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,420
Here, take it away.

489
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,740
And remember that they only change the "mineromedicinal de Fontecilla"

490
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,340
by "miraculous of San Dimas". When do you want them?

491
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,500
On Thursday I plan to put a place where the miracle, so calculate.

492
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,500
What do I ask, 250 or do you think 500 is better?

493
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,740
Don't bother, at least 3000. Sounds like a lot to me.

494
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,660
Well, order them, and if there is any excess, for next Thursday and in peace.

495
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,460
-Do you understand? -That's also true.

496
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,980
A truth that I have seen with these eyes,

497
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,780
with the same eyes that see Silvestre now,

498
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,540
put your finger in the inkwell and paint the neck of the one in front.

499
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,220
Boys, Fontecilla was chosen by good San Dimas,

500
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,140
who loves them so much,

501
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,860
to bear witness to a true miracle.

502
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,780
A very beautiful and very great miracle.

503
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,180
As big as your children's hearts.

504
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,420
Vizcaíno, give you a slap.

505
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,980
So tell your families that on Thursday you should bring candles.

506
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,420
Izarbe, what should you bring on Thursday?

507
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,820
Candles, many candles.

508
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,260
15 or 20 packages.

509
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,060
You send them to me by the first mail.

510
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,780
Hey? But still don't know there?

511
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,020
Wait, wait a minute.

512
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,420
Concha, explain to this man about the miracle, I'm going to the town hall.

513
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,940
But, Antonio, for God's sake, by conference.

514
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,420
Two pesetas every three minutes.

515
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,420
But do you want to stop thinking about money?

516
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,220
You see, they say San Dimas showed up.

517
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,780
Several people have seen it last time.

518
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,580
Some ladies who take the waters in the spa.

519
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,220
-The teacher has also seen it. -I've seen it.

520
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,260
And do you believe me or do you not believe me?

521
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,660
If you believe me, well, but if you don't believe me, damn it,

522
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,460
I mark the nut to my father.

523
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,620
But he calculates that it was the invention of the priests

524
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,860
to get us the rooms. Well, I don't know them.

525
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,860
But have I not told you a hundred times that it appeared in the air?

526
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,300
Here in Spain you are so stupid that until you break your nose,

527
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,620
do not create a firewood.

528
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,780
Hey, Matías, who are you calling for?

529
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,100
It's very important.

530
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,020
Read it right away. All right, Don Antonio, to send.

531
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,180
By order of the mayor,

532
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,340
It is made known that by making sure with neighbors of this village

533
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,340
has agreed with Don Antonio Guajardo

534
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,220
the rental of your van, which will leave every half hour,

535
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,620
Who is the city council to get where they are not called?

536
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,740
Well, you tell him that while the Church does not recognize the miracle,

537
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,180
who wants to see San Dimas, go by bicycle.

538
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,700
I'll tell Don Antonio, you'll see how he suspends the truck.

539
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,980
Hey, hey, wait.

540
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,220
We have to talk you and me. I cannot consent to what they do.

541
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,740
Don Fidel, calm down, don't you see that everyone wants to go?

542
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,580
Look, don't fool me.

543
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,940
They are pushing people onto dangerous ground.

544
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,300
Very comfortable, to say that it is not very comfortable.

545
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,740
And what do you want me to do?

546
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,340
What does the canonization of Mauro and doña Paquita ask for?

547
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,380
No, sir, but at least you go.

548
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,460
Have the curiosity of the National Magisterium,

549
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,820
that he is also catholic.

550
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,420
It is very easy to close your eyes and say that nothing has been seen.

551
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,740
Well, we will see that of San Dimas, of course we will.

552
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,500
You have to see the game that the scoundrel Don Antonio gets out of him.

553
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,580
Instead you, stunned, you prefer your little games

554
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,940
instead of coming to thank him for showing up on your grounds.

555
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,620
For the last time, are you coming or not? Do not force me.

556
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,820
I don't want to know anything about a miracle

557
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,460
which does not yet have ecclesiastical approval.

558
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,180
Okay, then I'll go alone, like always.

559
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,260
Don José, it's us, come down.

560
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,740
Nothing, no answer. What does not answer?

561
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,180
Will something happen to him? I dont know.

562
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,900
Hello, Dona Margarita, at your feet.

563
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,100
Your husband ... My husband is not up for games.

564
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,780
It is not for miracles, then it is not for little games.

565
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,700
Yes, sure, good night, ma'am.

566
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,180
Let's go? Let's go.

567
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,820
Ay, ay.

568
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,900
So bad. Come on, Don José.

569
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,460
Nerd!

570
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,940
No, no, I'm not going, ay.

571
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,820
Ok, I'm going the same. So bad...

572
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,220
Give me a glass.

573
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,580
Thank you.

574
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,020
Thank you.

575
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,100
The same, the same.

576
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,340
Yes, the same, but two pesetas more expensive.

577
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,900
-A fraud. -Amazing.

578
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,340
Luisito, the needles of the stations do not touch!

579
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,660
Remember the Titanic.

580
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,820
-Goodnight. -Goodnight.

581
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,580
What a few hours to come.

582
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,740
You're late, huh?

583
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,220
Don Eugenio, tell them to put you a glass.

584
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,700
-This water looks like another. -And total, for two more pesetas.

585
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,060
You, baby, baby.

586
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,300
-What a difference. -Yeah sure.

587
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,820
Hey, why don't you hang on for a bit? Now it is OK.

588
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,220
I am the coach.

589
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,380
Do you hear? That sounds like San Dimas is coming.

590
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,500
What goes, is the goods, which brings delay.

591
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,900
The gramophone, but who has left it on the road?

592
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,460
I don't show up without music.

593
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,700
But if the band is there ... But also Don Fidel,

594
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,020
What can you ask me about things from heaven?

595
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,180
and say what San Nicasio does.

596
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,060
And what do I know who San Nicasio is? Well, I didn't answer him.

597
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,900
It comes from heaven, it doesn't have to.

598
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,780
But a poor fool can be fooled.

599
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,540
Now, I don't know if 300 people ... 300 people and a priest.

600
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,500
And who has given you permission to come here with that candle? Come on

601
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,180
Get out.

602
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,780
Well, it seems that this Don Dimas

603
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,500
Railroad customs have caught on a bit.

604
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,420
You don't know what punctuality is.

605
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,060
Three minutes past 00:00 and three minutes are nothing.

606
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,860
As much as nothing, haven't you ever put on a lecture?

607
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,140
Very funny, very funny joke.

608
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,460
We'll see who laughs at the end.

609
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,220
Come on, get out of here. Come here, boy.

610
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,540
I don't go out, huh? What do you mean not?

611
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,620
If you want there to be a miracle, you do it.

612
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,140
You dress as any saint and say:

613
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,380
"San Dimas cannot come, he has a lot to do."

614
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,020
That is an informality. Whatever I want, but I don't go out.

615
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,740
Are you sure that cable goes there?

616
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,380
Do I get into the fuse that you put on your rockets?

617
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,020
Don't you understand that there will be a short circuit when you plug in?

618
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,060
If you keep nagging me, I put down the projector.

619
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,380
Ah, very good, there you, but that cable is bad.

620
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,700
Please...

621
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,780
Wow, a very timely blackout.

622
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,220
Timely.

623
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,140
He has melted down the entire village facility.

624
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,020
Let's see what we do now. Sure, you have maddened me.

625
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,820
Let me give you a sign so you don't get nervous.

626
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,300
What do we do if the light doesn't come? They will give it right away.

627
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,300
In the transformer there is a guard.

628
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,820
Do you hear it? They are impatient.

629
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,380
The best thing is to get out, Don José.

630
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,060
Why do you turn off the flashlight? It must be from the stack.

631
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,620
With the rockets there will be plenty of lighting.

632
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,220
Mr Jose. Mr Jose!

633
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,260
Does not hear me? Mr Jose!

634
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,700
Hey, Don José.

635
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,540
Where has he been? I think it's gone.

636
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,140
Wait, it looks like I caught it. And I also.

637
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,500
Good evening, Don Salvador. Goodnight.

638
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,980
Come on, kids.

639
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,500
Gee, how soon you got tired of waiting.

640
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,740
Children, poor children, have to sleep.

641
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,340
Of course, of course.

642
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,700
Luisito.

643
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,740
A well-behaved child should not play with insects.

644
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,540
Remember that they transmit diseases.

645
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,220
How will this child be told to be still where he is sent?

646
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,020
When I was a child, I would keep quiet if they gave me a book.

647
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,620
How many times have I read "Corazón" by di Amicis?

648
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,820
Arturo, if you don't take care of your grandson, misfortune may happen.

649
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,260
I'm going, I'm going right away.

650
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,100
He dies in the Battle of Jutland, I'm sure.

651
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,180
He is going to tell me that I have read the story of Blasco Ibáñez.

652
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,820
It was the year the Austro-Hungarian Empire was lost.

653
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,140
-Arthur! -I go.

654
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,060
If you had made the connections right.

655
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,660
You are getting heavy.

656
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,540
It wasn't me who took advantage of the blackout to defect.

657
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,100
Well said, very well said.

658
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,460
If I had held the guy

659
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,380
we would not play now perrachica la bean.

660
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,500
What if we tried again today? Is Thursday.

661
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,300
Your aunt will show up, not me.

662
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,780
Auction it because it doesn't have a nickel left there.

663
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,700
Is there no one who will leave me a couple of dollars?

664
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,340
I'll give them back to you right away. Yeah huh

665
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,340
With the work that it has cost me to earn them.

666
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,220
With the money he owes Don Manuel and all of us.

667
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,380
You owe me $ 50 in penicillin alone.

668
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
Those are old debts.

669
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,300
The game is the game

670
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,020
and what is gained by playing should not be given to anyone.

671
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,980
The descending one at 3:40 p.m.

672
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,820
What informality. Why?

673
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,340
Because it's exactly 3:40 p.m.

674
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,020
¡Eh, corran!

675
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,740
Fuck him, he's in the wagon!

676
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,220
Stop it, it's my house!

677
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,540
Hey, stop it, it's my house!

678
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,460
Stop it!

679
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,060
Sorry, friend, but the houses should not be on the road.

680
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,460
You will have to find it for me.

681
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,220
You have released the brake.

682
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,740
It's many miles downhill.

683
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,500
and the great station, and many tracks.

684
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,820
It will be lost, they will never find it.

685
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,180
I don't have a home either.

686
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,300
You have escaped from the guards. They were taking him to jail, I know.

687
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,940
Hey, listen ...! Shut up, shut up.

688
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,220
Don't yell like that, no one can hear you.

689
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,180
Nobody, do you think nobody.

690
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,300
I have a friend who listens to us because he works miracles.

691
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,740
Are you a friend of God?

692
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,020
We are all friends of God. You less, of course, but no.

693
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,860
It is not God.

694
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,420
Do you want to know my friend's name?

695
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,860
It is called San Dimas. San Dimas?

696
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,780
Hey, San Dimas, I'm Mauro! Don't shout so much, it's not necessary

697
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,420
the saints have good ears.

698
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,580
I have seen many people praying and they could not be heard within two steps.

699
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,140
Santo San Dimas santo, hear me.

700
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,340
Here I am with the man, my house is gone. And the guards.

701
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,980
Santo San Dimas, listen to me, there is a man ...

702
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,700
there is a man who lived in jail.

703
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,620
Get him back there.

704
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,180
I'm Mauro, Mauro.

705
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,900
Surely San Dimas will be mad at you if you ask him to pursue me.

706
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,900
Don't forget that before he was a saint, he was a thief.

707
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,860
If instead of denouncing me, you would lend me your help, he would be happy.

708
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,580
Do you understand And it is even probable that one day he will return to Fontecilla.

709
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,740
Who told you that it was already? Where I was, everything is known.

710
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,220
But tell me, what did San Dimas look like?

711
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,740
Very old man, he coughed many times.

712
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,580
One night I was about to give him my cimarra.

713
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,900
Oh yeah?

714
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,140
You know? I like Fontecilla, yes,

715
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,140
but not his living forces.

716
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,940
(Reception bell)

717
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,140
So much fun, huh?

718
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,100
There was no one. What do you do when no one is there?

719
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,420
The bell is rung. What the hell do you want?

720
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,740
A room,

721
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,300
but I do not like.

722
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,420
What? Everything, everything smells dirty.

723
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,500
Yes, we will have to clean a little, air it, let the sun come in,

724
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,980
the papers are damp.

725
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,500
The paintings look like national awards for Fine Arts.

726
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,220
Plants do not have the slightest dose of chlorophyll.

727
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,940
And the furniture?

728
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,860
The furniture is very uncomfortable. And the pension 80 pesetas per person

729
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,620
entitled to water from the source of health. It's convenient?

730
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,220
It suits me if the right to contemplate the miracle is included.

731
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,300
How do you say? Is there no miracle? What a pity.

732
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,420
Thus there is no way for the spa to increase its clientele.

733
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,180
Please tell me your name?

734
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,060
Ah yes, put Martino.

735
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,900
I can't enroll you like this.

736
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,220
Yes you can.

737
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,220
Don't you know that there are provisions that ...?

738
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,780
Forget them. Firm.

739
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,380
Okay, I can hardly move my hand.

740
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,460
Whoever never wore them cannot imagine the damage

741
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,180
that make tight-fitting handcuffs

742
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,700
You? But you...

743
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,140
I am a good thief who has been attracted by the miracle.

744
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,700
Take. Well.

745
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,020
I'll go upstairs to clean up a bit. I've been on a long journey

746
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,340
and it shows.

747
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,380
See you later.

748
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,260
Well done.

749
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,780
And now I'll give you a cinchona friction and served.

750
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,220
But very badly served. Hey?

751
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,860
Do you think this is a haircut?

752
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,340
Look, these curls are unmatched, and what sideburns.

753
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,320
This cannot be left like that, I will protest.

754
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,260
I will have the government take action on this matter immediately.

755
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,560
Luckily, everything in life has an arrangement.

756
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,400
Where did you find that wig? Nerd,

757
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,740
If you guess, I'll give it back to you. But if it's not mine

758
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,340
if I have never needed ...

759
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,100
As you will see, nothing favors me.

760
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,620
And maybe you know a saint who needs it.

761
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,000
Goodbye.

762
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,820
Look, take a good look at this hat and what's underneath.

763
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,860
We mean the price tag.

764
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,460
For these models, we hope they will shine during the summer,

765
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,380
even if husbands have to work overtime in winter.

766
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,860
Elche, the beautiful Levantine city, surrounded by palm trees,

767
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,540
performs a representation of its wonderful mystery.

768
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,500
Between the first and second act of the sacroliric drama.

769
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,820
The image of the Virgin ... He has dropped something.

770
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,220
This.

771
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,260
Be careful with tunnels, things are lost and not found.

772
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,820
Let's see, open your mouth wide.

773
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,460
I don't see anything, my tonsils are normal.

774
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,860
I do not explain those inconveniences.

775
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,780
What annoyances? What annoyances?

776
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,020
Didn't you say your ears were ringing and your throat hurt?

777
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,060
Something must be said when you go to the doctor.

778
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,500
You are an artist handling light.

779
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:00,820
You should teach me.

780
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,260
What is this? A joke?

781
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,540
No, doctor, a miracle, a miracle of science.

782
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,860
Ah, the electricity.

783
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,580
However, care must be taken with the connections

784
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,540
because if you are not careful with the connections, goodbye miracle.

785
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:21,980
Hey? Who's there?

786
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,940
Who is the idiot who scares me rabbits?

787
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,860
Does not answer?

788
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,980
Who the hell scares me hunting? Come in, have a seat.

789
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,580
The lands are mine, and the rabbit was also mine.

790
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,300
So I guess being inside your property,

791
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,860
I must also belong to him, right?

792
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,620
Want to see how I still shoot you?

793
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,860
I prefer to teach him to kill rabbits. You have no idea.

794
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,020
What does? Damn, the shotgun is mine.

795
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,460
He takes the shotgun

796
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,860
leans on the shoulder, like this.

797
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,380
It points anywhere

798
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,300
and hours and hours are expected

799
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,260
until something comes into focus.

800
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,980
An abandoned wagon

801
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,700
a poor madman

802
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:00,020
or maybe better, a tunnel.

803
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,500
It aims well and ...

804
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,900
A gluttonous man would say it is a donut.

805
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,620
A folkloric, a Cordovan hat seen from above.

806
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,820
A geometrician would simply see two concentric circles.

807
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,620
And a fearful ...

808
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,020
What would a fearful person say, Don José?

809
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,220
Do not come to me with stories, that guy knows everything.

810
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,780
That guy doesn't know anything.

811
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,220
It has been shown that appearance is one thing and reality is another.

812
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,660
And the reality is that nobody can be aware

813
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,380
of our activities.

814
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,420
Unless...

815
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,540
Unless there has been a betrayal,

816
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,100
Dare you suggest that I may be a traitor?

817
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,420
I did not say you.

818
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,060
I have said any one. It is true,

819
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,980
one of you has told him everything.

820
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,860
How one of you? It can be you

821
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,420
or it could be you, or it could be ... no, not me.

822
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,380
I was at the movies, I had never seen it.

823
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,420
Why don't they ask Don Ramón?

824
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,220
Who spoke to him first. Oh yeah?

825
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,540
I am as honored as the first and more than you.

826
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,580
On top of that he insults me, I really can't stand it.

827
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,420
Be careful, I'm going to lose patience.

828
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,820
And why didn't Don Antonio do it? Because it is enough to be mayor.

829
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,140
Enough, silence!

830
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,540
Silence!

831
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,460
Arguing like this for nonsense.

832
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,460
Do you call it nonsense that they come to blackmail us?

833
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,020
I call it foolish to be afraid of that man.

834
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,460
If he knew anything about our matter, he would have talked to me too.

835
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,260
He has been in Fontecilla for three days

836
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,300
and he still hasn't done anything to see me. Sorry.

837
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,980
He came to see if there are night classes in this school.

838
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,220
I would like to learn the life of the saints well.

839
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,260
Dammit.

840
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,420
Shut up, demon.

841
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,860
Let's see, let's see.

842
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,980
Most Illustrious Lord, the quail ban will be lifted.

843
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,340
Don Antonio, how timely.

844
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,460
Don't yell so loud, the sergeant will wake up.

845
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,740
Watch out, I've put a sleeping pill in the seals you take for rheumatism.

846
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,580
Hold on, the neighbors ...

847
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,740
and Mr. Antonio Guajardo Fontana will pay 500 pesetas of fine

848
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,420
for violation of the Water Law.

849
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,540
Damn it, let them do this job to me, the mayor.

850
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,180
It is that in Spain you cannot live. There is nothing here.

851
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,180
It has to be on the table or in one of the drawers.

852
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,100
Yes, but they sure are closed.

853
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,420
Well, let's see, let's see.

854
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,740
Didn't I say it? These guards don't trust anyone.

855
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,260
But Don Antonio, don't be foolish, this can cost us dearly.

856
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,580
Lost to the river.

857
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,740
Leave me, and if I break it, the better.

858
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,300
Let them bother.

859
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,620
Here it is.

860
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,060
Alum.

861
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,940
He is wanted for alleged perpetrator of robbery with fractured drawers

862
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,460
at the Civil Guard Command.

863
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,020
Atiza, like ours.

864
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,620
Yes, go on.

865
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,700
The Chilean.

866
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,340
Here's one without a photo.

867
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,260
Rafael Villena alias El Señorito, habitual offender

868
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,060
against property ... What else?

869
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,140
84 years. No, this is not it. No no no.

870
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,900
Zamora, Zamorano ... There is a piece of paper.

871
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,420
Let's see.

872
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,940
Recipe to polish patent leather.

873
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,460
This must be something unique to Sgt.

874
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,860
There should be something earlier. Ramos told us he had the mark

875
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,540
of handcuffs. Let's search calmly.

876
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,620
Maybe there is another file here.

877
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,420
Hi.

878
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,180
You again. What does she want?

879
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,020
Here is the tab.

880
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,740
Give it to me. I'm sorry, but it's mine.

881
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,500
Give it to me. No, let's leave these things

882
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,420
in the hands of the Civil Guard. Token borrowed, token forgotten.

883
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,340
But man, that's just to check it out.

884
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,220
Nerd. You see, I am going to propose you a very interesting riddle.

885
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,180
You must speak first. Say, what am I?

886
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,020
Well, I don't know ... Don't be afraid.

887
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,380
Say, for example, murderer. Nerd.

888
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,740
Come on, say it without fear, tell me.

889
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,380
Nerd. Say: "Murderer".

890
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,900
Assassin. Fatal error

891
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,340
that it can cost you dearly to call me a murderer.

892
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,820
Don Antonio, what comes to mind? I cannot consent to this.

893
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,540
You will have to consent, it amuses me. It's me?

894
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,220
Currency counterfeiter, drug dealer?

895
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,580
Blackmailer?

896
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,100
Pass, pass.

897
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,020
Now we go up, let's show you this.

898
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,060
C'mon C'mon.

899
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,580
Hurry up

900
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,180
Hurry up.

901
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,740
-Come, come. -Come on.

902
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,900
Wait a minute. What do you think?

903
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,020
I like it, but don't think you have bought my silence.

904
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,020
Is living in the royal suite not enough for you?

905
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,420
A place for princes, for dancers.

906
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,020
Or for thieves.

907
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,380
At this table I always want a bottle of Fontecilla water.

908
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,780
Why? I am interested in its healing virtues.

909
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,180
Well okay. I could make a few changes

910
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,580
in this room.

911
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,700
It would be much more comfortable.

912
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,460
Look. What happens?

913
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,660
I would like this mirror more tilted forward.

914
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,220
What difference does it make? Is to see them

915
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,980
while playing cards.

916
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,220
It is convenient for them to feel observed. You get better when you know they are looking at you.

917
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,380
Should we also entertain him? I want joy, some music.

918
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,180
Is there a piano in this hotel? Yes there is: that one.

919
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,060
Magnificent! We are going to organize a party.

920
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,700
How about a play with the guests of the spa?

921
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,260
Before they represented one between months, but now they are so few and old ...

922
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,060
That they will no longer remember anything.

923
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,220
I already have it!

924
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,380
We will rehearse the life of San Dimas. Doña Paquita will come out on her knees.

925
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,220
But who will play the saint? That's the problem.

926
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,020
I will be in charge of presenting the show.

927
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,820
As an aperitif, little magic numbers.

928
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,380
And, as the end of the party, something serious as they like it. Look, have this.

929
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,900
Nothing in this hand, nothing in the other.

930
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,940
And now ... One, two.

931
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,540
One two.

932
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,740
Attention! The great Martino is going to surprise them and perhaps himself

933
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,700
with the appearance of an unexpected object.

934
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,620
Man! A tablet of soap.

935
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,860
That means it's bath time.

936
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,260
Half force or full force? All, 70 degrees at least.

937
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,140
-Did you not want comfort? Take comfort. -Blackmail me, I'm the mayor!

938
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,180
-Almost reached the top. -Well, hold on for a little while.

939
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,540
You cannot hear him protest. What if we really cooked it?

940
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,780
No, the human body resists to incredible lengths.

941
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,060
I remember the case of a tax inspector who once ...

942
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,620
Hey? What?

943
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,100
Are you comfortable?

944
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,340
That the water is ice cold?

945
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,620
Wait I'm going to give you a candle!

946
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,820
What? Are we getting warm?

947
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,380
We are entering unknown seas and you are my boatman.

948
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,340
What funny things he comes up with ...

949
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,420
This...

950
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,940
It was a joke. It was indeed.

951
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,060
I like jokes, happy people.

952
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,500
Impossible. Impossible. But it is.

953
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,580
The cabin has no other exit and we have seen him enter.

954
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,140
They saw me get into that one

955
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,820
But I made them believe I was coming in here

956
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,420
Answer quickly: who killed Cain? Abel. What nonsense, it is the opposite.

957
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,300
Sees it? I can make them think backwards for a while.

958
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,220
Hypnotism? Who knows.

959
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,580
Whatever it is, I don't believe in those things.

960
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,700
Raise your left hand. There, what's up?

961
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,020
-The left has told him. -And what am I doing?

962
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,980
-That's the right one. -Do you take me for a fool?

963
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,220
-It's the right. -The left, a lifetime.

964
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,580
No, you are confused. It has hypnotized you.

965
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,940
What is going to hypnotize me? It's the left!

966
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,460
While they come to an agreement, I'm going to get dressed.

967
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,140
Come in half an hour to the royal suite.

968
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,460
We will discuss literature, music

969
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:51,660
and even miracles if you like.

970
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,660
Ah, Dona Paquita!

971
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,740
At a hundred degrees it will start to burn, take it out as soon as possible.

972
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,820
Doña Paquita!

973
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,180
A wonderful bathroom, I am like new.

974
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,340
Left ... I'm already crazy.

975
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,820
Come on, come on! Shoot, dare.

976
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,140
Well!

977
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,580
Bravo! That awful.

978
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,260
It is inconceivable.

979
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,860
This trick always excites you.

980
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,180
I have seen the best specialists do it,

981
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,980
some were killed by the bullet.

982
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,460
But in full action?

983
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,060
Sure, in rehearsals it always works out.

984
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,820
Do you want to know another trick? Which one?

985
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,260
Get a public official

986
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,420
creates, for example, silkworm, tape measure

987
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,220
or storm over a forest.

988
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,260
Make me believe that I have the left hand

989
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,700
where right, still.

990
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,660
But to feel what one is not ... It is a bit strong.

991
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,620
Now we will see, but for the record, I did not come to amuse you.

992
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:07,340
Is there no one who wishes to feel like an ice skater, Viscount

993
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,900
or academic of Fine Arts?

994
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,780
This...

995
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,740
(LAUGHS) None?

996
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,420
There is only one thing to convince us. What is it?

997
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:24,940
May Don José return the money he owes us.

998
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,780
That, that. I will do more:

999
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,660
I'll make you the first philanthropist

1000
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,620
of Fontecilla. What is a philanthropist?

1001
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,300
Philanthropist is to be generous, charitable ...

1002
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,540
Don't care about money. Nerd!

1003
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,340
I don't want to be a philanthropist! Let go of me!

1004
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,740
Let go of me! I don't want to be a philanthropist!

1005
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,220
I'd rather be an ice skater or one of those fine arts!

1006
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,780
Never! My money! You have to please your friends.

1007
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,500
We're aiming.

1008
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,060
Come.

1009
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,100
Come.

1010
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,500
Look at me No I can not. I can not.

1011
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,460
Don't you want to look at this beautiful bright

1012
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,020
200 carats?

1013
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,660
It can be up to you.

1014
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,060
Very pretty. It's not pretty, it's repulsive.

1015
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,460
It's gross. Money is also disgusting.

1016
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,780
The money, what crap.

1017
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,780
He is now giving away ten thousand pesetas for parish works.

1018
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,860
The church needs a new bell.

1019
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,500
The casino, a pool table. Mauro, some pants.

1020
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,220
And Don Manuel, the 20 duros that I owe him.

1021
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,220
And to me the 50 of the penicillin. Yes bye.

1022
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,660
I'm going to get more money from my wife.

1023
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,140
(LAUGHS) This is easy.

1024
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,540
Much more than the appearance of a saint

1025
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:42,940
in an abandoned station.

1026
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,820
We are simple amateurs, you do ...

1027
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,820
Listen, we're going to do something important.

1028
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,620
You put faith in San Dimas and I put everything else.

1029
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,900
When I saw you in the tunnel I understood that if I joined you

1030
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,740
We could overcome their flaws and mine, of course.

1031
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,620
You saw us, that explains everything.

1032
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,700
Yes, I saw them.

1033
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,860
Other people saw them too, but no one was interested

1034
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,420
both the matter and me.

1035
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,540
You talked about joining us.

1036
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,540
That means a lot. It means that it's okay

1037
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,380
of playing blackmail and that San Dimas returns to Fontecilla.

1038
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,980
Don't count on me. I count on your amazement

1039
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,540
you will be surprised by everything that happens.

1040
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,620
You will write chronicles, you will contribute the miraculous water,

1041
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:29,940
you land and you will listen to all the look for the miracle.

1042
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,540
There will be very serious lung problems, heart problems,

1043
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,140
An Our Father to Saint Dimas can do wonders.

1044
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,540
Oh great. San Dimas returns.

1045
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,660
Now no one will last from him, but ...

1046
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,340
Who will dress up as a saint?

1047
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,260
Don José does not want to. And matters?

1048
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,180
The apparitions must be authentic.

1049
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,620
Actually San Dimas is not going back to Fontecilla.

1050
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,460
The miracles return. Or they start. But how?

1051
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,060
Very easy. With the mystery of a single word.

1052
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,420
Some call it faith.

1053
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,540
Don Evaristo, recreational physicist. And me...

1054
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,940
Someday I'll tell you who is right.

1055
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,220
So what is the first prodigy going to be?

1056
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,340
It can be for example ...

1057
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,660
Ah! Carmela's ear. This may be the symbol of your deafness.

1058
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,500
Can you hear me now, Carmela? Naturally, sir.

1059
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,260
Let's pray.

1060
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,140
(SPEAKS IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE)

1061
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,660
Well, well.

1062
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,380
-Wait. -Let me.

1063
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,580
Hey, Don Manuel! How did it go? Were there faints?

1064
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,780
Was any sinner converted? Are you going to organize the processions?

1065
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,500
It was awesome. As it did?

1066
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,740
Playing my head at a height of more than 40 meters.

1067
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,660
And the light was a projector? No, a simple mirror.

1068
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,780
That? Yes. Look at the people.

1069
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,060
It's true, she's upset.

1070
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,180
Although rabie Don Evaristo, you got some effects

1071
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,500
that he already wanted.

1072
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,100
We are both amateurs. There are those who do it even better.

1073
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:38,060
Look what a beautiful morning! Everything is perfect.

1074
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,100
With details that are very difficult to achieve like this breeze from the southwest.

1075
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,540
Tell me, don't you feel a sense of well-being?

1076
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,220
What I notice is that I am getting a cold.

1077
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,020
Your town is beautiful from above.

1078
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,660
But it is getting too late.

1079
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,780
Remember that they are waiting for us at the spa.

1080
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,620
Did you know that there are 32 acacias in the municipality?

1081
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,940
You said miracles started at 11:45.

1082
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,540
I'm not in a rush yet. Look down there in the river.

1083
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,580
There is a nice backwater. Some bathe, others fish,

1084
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,300
others walk.

1085
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,300
Sometimes I think that the greatest miracle is that everything works this way.

1086
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,460
With such simplicity. Yes, yes, check it out.

1087
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,340
Everything is in place.

1088
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,660
Sounds easy to you?

1089
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,860
Well come on, try yourself.

1090
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,940
(LAUGHS) Try.

1091
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:29,260
But it's almost 12 o'clock! You have nothing prepared yet.

1092
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,820
It is the same, I am an artist

1093
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,900
and artists we like improvisation.

1094
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,580
I am a priest and we do not like to be miracle workers because if we were

1095
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,620
calculate the skids we would hit.

1096
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,100
But if everyone saw it. It was something supernatural.

1097
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,340
A window that opens suddenly, a ray of sunlight, natural things.

1098
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,540
Doña Paquita is dying and I have given her only half strength!

1099
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,300
Gentlemen, this time, it really is.

1100
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,380
Don Ramón, I'm sorry to tell you that room 18

1101
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,860
-He will also be free. -Stop the stupid jokes.

1102
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:02,800
They are not joking, he is dying. And nothing can be done?

1103
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,740
Any American medicine? I would pay whatever it was.

1104
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,260
Not America, nothing. If you want to spend the money on Doña Paquita,

1105
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,940
-Buy her a flower crown. -Poor woman!

1106
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,860
Fortunately it is already 00:00, the time to start the prodigies.

1107
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,260
Do you want to try it with Dona Paquita?

1108
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,660
-Very good. -In the case of a heart attack

1109
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,780
nothing less, all you do is waste time.

1110
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,700
Don't believe it. I listened.

1111
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,940
You don't hear anything, do you? Not.

1112
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,060
And yet you see, I am fully alive.

1113
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,580
My medicine, and everyone's, is light.

1114
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,220
Give me a tape, Don Evaristo. Yes.

1115
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:40,380
What are you going to do? San Dimas is already illuminated,

1116
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,380
now it only remains to illuminate the water.

1117
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,380
We will direct a beam of direct suggestion on the source

1118
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,660
from which all must drink to produce a reflection.

1119
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,380
From this moment the waters of Fontecilla are miraculous.

1120
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,020
That is, they can already cure diseases.

1121
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,860
But what diseases? If apart from Dona Paquita ...

1122
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,900
How is it that there are no sick people?

1123
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:05,700
You cannot consent.

1124
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,420
You, to bed right now with a colic in the gallbladder.

1125
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:10,780
Me? If I...

1126
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,020
But if the gallbladder was removed for two years

1127
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,340
Before the war.

1128
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,820
Don Salvador is prone. Hey?

1129
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,460
Take care of the symptoms tonight: numbness and pain.

1130
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,820
Don't worry, the colic will be a hit. Well.

1131
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,660
I would like a patient with appendicitis. Let's see...

1132
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,420
You? No I do not.

1133
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,380
Don Manuel is indeed pale. Look, look!

1134
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,460
It doesn't matter who it is as long as it is healed by spirit.

1135
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,860
The spirit is thirsty and there is its water.

1136
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,180
Look out!

1137
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,300
But don't cover the beam. And let's see what happens with Dona Eva.

1138
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,420
Luisito, don't go near the lake where you've had a banana!

1139
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,940
Well, you can get closer.

1140
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,380
But without putting your hand in the water!

1141
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,660
(LAUGHS) How funny. Get in the water!

1142
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,860
A well-mannered child does whatever he wants.

1143
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,380
Don Fidel! Hey, Don Fidel!

1144
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,780
Don Fidel! Come up, Don Fidel!

1145
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,460
This water is miraculous, it has saved my life! Drink a little!

1146
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,980
Don Joaquín Sapena. Me?

1147
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,100
Acérquese.

1148
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,540
Here.

1149
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,420
Children,

1150
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,340
by allowing you to attend

1151
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,500
to my last moments, I'm giving you the best lesson

1152
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,220
theoretical-practical on the transience of life.

1153
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,340
Rodriguez, don't put your finger up your nose! I give you a slap ...!

1154
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,820
(TIRITA)

1155
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,900
Children,

1156
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,980
you are going to witness

1157
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,980
the death of a man who gave everything for teaching.

1158
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,460
And in the absence of manuals on the matter,

1159
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,140
transforms into waxed

1160
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,220
his funeral bed.

1161
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,940
(TIRITA)

1162
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:06,340
You are the first of the class, touch my forehead. Do not be afraid.

1163
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,660
Touch and calculate my fever in degrees centigrade.

1164
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,740
Calculate!

1165
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,140
I don't notice any heat.

1166
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,860
Sapena, you are the first of the class.

1167
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,180
I slap you like that!

1168
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,060
You must know that my fever is very high!

1169
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,780
What temperature do I have?

1170
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,780
I dont know. (BAND AID)

1171
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,980
What temperature do I have?

1172
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,420
39'5.

1173
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:33,460
-This is getting alarming! -Yes?

1174
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,300
Yes, very alarming!

1175
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,860
Do not be scared that he had it prepared.

1176
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,060
Anyway, the symptoms are obvious.

1177
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,580
I have never come across a case as clear cut as this.

1178
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,140
- Do you think it's something serious? - It could be.

1179
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:48,140
For now, do not move. Absolute immobility.

1180
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,220
And don't forget to put ice packs on your abdominal region.

1181
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,340
"Let's see, Don Manuel!" -Yes, my back hurts.

1182
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,020
-I think I have pneumonia. -You have appendicitis.

1183
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,900
-Appendicitis. -Not.

1184
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,220
What I have is pneumonia, I'm sure.

1185
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,820
But man, remember: Don Salvador, typhoid fever

1186
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,820
and you, appendicitis.

1187
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,420
509, 510, 511, 512, 513...

1188
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,860
Listen! Don't you think a lot of bottles?

1189
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,740
In the last ten years he had not sold even half.

1190
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:19,260
You must have a liter of water ready for each man in this world.

1191
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,420
A cursory estimate gives us about two billion.

1192
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,020
Couldn't we just leave the Chinese? No, no, the Chinese

1193
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,900
they also have a right to the wonderful.

1194
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,060
Will it not be necessary to encourage people with prizes on the cap?

1195
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,340
A floor, a sewing machine, something like that.

1196
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:33,820
It's not a bad idea.

1197
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,140
This water tastes so bad that no one will drink it

1198
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,540
If we only promise miracles Does it taste so bad?

1199
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,980
But haven't you tried it? Me? In my life, what for?

1200
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,460
Try it, it's only fair. She has to suffer like everyone else.

1201
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,860
Yuck! What crap!

1202
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,460
We have redressed a reprehensible lack of professional ethics. What time is it?

1203
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,460
2:45 p.m., the Maldonados have just arrived at the pavilion.

1204
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,380
And our first bottles are reaching their goal.

1205
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,500
Above all with devotion, with a lot of devotion

1206
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,580
and slowly, in small sips.

1207
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,260
An Our Father to Saint Dimas.

1208
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,860
Our father who art in Heaven.

1209
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,340
Yes, go on, pray to San Dimas.

1210
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,860
In this of miracles we have jinx.

1211
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,980
Now he goes back and forth with double pneumonia.

1212
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,660
If you need to buy something ... I've put camphor oil in it.

1213
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,860
Doña Paquita was cured yesterday with the water.

1214
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,740
Listen, for pneumococcus there is nothing but penicillin.

1215
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,540
Hail Mary, you are full of grace.

1216
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,860
The Lord is with you.

1217
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,220
Blessed you are.

1218
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,180
I signal him to finish drinking the water.

1219
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,900
I can not think of anything else. And what good is that?

1220
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,780
If I knew anything about medicine, I wouldn't say such nonsense.

1221
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,380
Now and at the hour of our death.

1222
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,260
Glory to the Father, glory to the Son.

1223
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,020
Glory to the Holy Spirit.

1224
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,420
What are you doing here?

1225
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,740
But ... is it possible?

1226
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,140
Is that I...

1227
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,540
Perhaps...?

1228
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,660
What happened? Why are they looking at me like that?

1229
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,860
-This is inexplicable. -Water!

1230
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,860
It was the water! The water of San Dimas!

1231
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,660
Miracle! Miracle!

1232
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,300
San Dimas wanted me to be the one to bring water to those who suffer.

1233
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,980
Where are there sick people?

1234
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,860
All must be cured!

1235
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:20,300
Don Salvador who is dying! You have typhoid fever.

1236
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,540
This is called a fever.

1237
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,620
It usually accompanies all infectious processes.

1238
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,220
(TIRITA)

1239
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,300
And when it reaches, as in my case,

1240
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:35,060
figures above 40 degrees

1241
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,820
means danger of death.

1242
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,580
José Rodríguez Lapuente! Please repeat me

1243
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,300
everything you just heard about fever.

1244
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,100
Fever

1245
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,540
it is a heat that enters

1246
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,820
when one is dying.

1247
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:55,580
All on your knees!

1248
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,620
Don Salvador.

1249
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,820
Will there be a glass around here?

1250
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,060
Oh yeah.

1251
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:03,620
Drink you, drink slowly

1252
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,580
and pray to each sip with me.

1253
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,620
It is the water of San Dimas! Give me!

1254
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:11,620
I feel very bad!

1255
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,380
I feel very bad!

1256
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,100
But I think.

1257
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,260
I think! And I entrust myself with all the powers of my soul

1258
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:21,700
to the sweet and pious Saint Dimas.

1259
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,300
Very well, and now we are going to pray the litanies of Saint Dimas.

1260
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,500
-Glorious Saint Dimas. -Glorious Saint Dimas.

1261
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:30,420
Glorious Saint Dimas.

1262
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:31,860
Glorious Saint Dimas.

1263
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:33,580
All that we entrust to you.

1264
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,260
All that we entrust to you.

1265
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,220
-Let's regain health. -Let's regain health.

1266
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,900
-So from the soul. -So from the soul.

1267
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:40,580
-Like the body. -Like the body.

1268
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,580
And bring peace to hearts ...

1269
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,060
So of the body, as of the soul.

1270
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,100
So of the body, as of the soul.

1271
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,340
So of the body, as of the soul.

1272
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,260
So of the body, as of the soul.

1273
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,220
Miracle!

1274
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,420
This water does not belong to you. It's from San Dimas!

1275
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:29,620
-And nobody does business with him. -But if half goes to taxes,

1276
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,420
also you can take the one you want.

1277
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,140
No, he charges me what he charges others.

1278
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:35,580
Here, mine and the children, I invite them.

1279
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,620
But by God, Dona Paquita!

1280
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:42,300
Hey, hey!

1281
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,260
-Hey, you, the peseta. -I don't have.

1282
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,620
Well, you'll give it to me, you owe it to me.

1283
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,300
What's wrong with you, you don't believe in San Dimas?

1284
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:54,060
Yes we believe, sir, we believe. What happens is that ...

1285
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:57,540
Don't be ashamed to say it. What happens is that we have no money.

1286
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:58,900
You neither? No sir.

1287
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,500
We have none. Wait.

1288
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,780
Do you know that water goes under the ground?

1289
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,020
Like a river that cannot be seen? That's.

1290
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:08,500
I am like an engineer, a water engineer

1291
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,700
and I'll tell you where that spring comes from.

1292
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,900
San Dimas appeared at the station.

1293
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,740
And there is a chute on the platform for the locomotives.

1294
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,300
¡San Dimas¡ ¡San Dimas! San Dimas!

1295
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,980
-I have seen San Dimas. -Drink this water,

1296
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,460
-It's for the miracle. -Well, he would have told me.

1297
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:09,140
-I heard the engineer say it. -Well, ask.

1298
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,140
Ask for it, come on!

1299
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:13,460
Help me, San Dimas!

1300
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:19,380
Pipo! Pipo, come here! Don't go, it's me!

1301
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:22,140
Pipo! Come! Come, Pipo!

1302
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,220
I asked San Dimas and he brought it to me.

1303
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,140
Pipo! Where have you been, Pipo?

1304
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,260
Handsome, come! Come with me!

1305
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,660
(LLORIQUEA) ¡Pipo!

1306
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,100
Miraculous water, a peseta the glass!

1307
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,820
Drink the miraculous water to peseta the glass!

1308
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,940
-Miraculous water! -Come on, give it to me!

1309
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,100
Mother, mother! I got it!

1310
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,060
Thanks to! Your son brings you the water!

1311
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,380
It was cured! It was cured!

1312
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,060
It was a miracle!

1313
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:30,620
It was a miracle, Pablo!

1314
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,260
Emilio, my Emilio who has been cured! I had the fevers and that's good!

1315
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:36,940
Miracle!

1316
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,300
It was a miracle!

1317
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,700
Don Salvador! But where is that man going?

1318
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:54,260
Stop him, Don Ramón!

1319
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:55,700
Don Salvador.

1320
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:57,460
¡Salvador!

1321
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,980
What happens? Where is it going?

1322
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,340
I don't know, to the church.

1323
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:05,740
I think I felt like praying.

1324
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,380
Still don't understand?

1325
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,060
That man suggested that he feel devoted.

1326
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:13,100
A very practical joke, come on. Don't talk to me about jokes!

1327
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:15,300
The one we did was the worst of all.

1328
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,860
¡Mire! ¡Mire!

1329
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,140
And that? That we could not imagine.

1330
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:21,620
Come on, come with us.

1331
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,860
-Now it is too late. -What's going on?

1332
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,580
How what is it? Bah, come on.

1333
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,780
We go and argue inside, we are puzzled.

1334
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,740
But what scandal is this? Listen to me!

1335
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,180
I can't have you go wild here!

1336
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,460
Can't you hear me? Silence!

1337
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,940
Leave the saint, or I'll call the Civil Guard!

1338
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,180
Doña Paquita, know that inside the church I do not tolerate other water

1339
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,820
other than holy water!

1340
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,860
I do not care! Whatever you have to tell me, in the confessional!

1341
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,900
On the street! Out all! The church is not a chicken coop!

1342
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,060
Here you come on Sundays at 8:00, so yes!

1343
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,700
Ale Ale! To make a ruckus, to the soccer field!

1344
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,380
Out all! Out all!

1345
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,180
Why not, my God?

1346
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:42,300
825 sick.

1347
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,440
4200 pilgrims in total.

1348
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,460
I use round numbers.

1349
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:49,740
I've called you to talk about the benefits.

1350
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,300
That is, so that I can talk about them if they don't mind.

1351
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,580
Section A: economic benefits.

1352
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,340
Let's calculate a profit of three pesetas per pilgrim,

1353
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,380
which means 10,200,000 pesetas a month.

1354
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,780
That is 122 million in a year, 212,000 in a century

1355
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:08,220
and one trillion two hundred billion in a millennium.

1356
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,860
Well, this is my offer.

1357
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,980
I buy them the monopoly of the miracle

1358
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,260
and I pay them all their cash value. Look.

1359
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,460
Money, bills.

1360
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,620
Money, more money! How much they have not been able to dream!

1361
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,380
Gold! An eternity of gold! We are not interested.

1362
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,260
Not? Neither you, Don Evaristo?

1363
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,140
I do not know! And don't play magic games anymore, we're not in the circus.

1364
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,100
Of course not. Not yet.

1365
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,220
You have to laugh, joy! You buy miracles!

1366
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:41,060
I pay more than anyone! Gold!

1367
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,900
Gold to cover the mountains, the rivers, to satisfy

1368
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:45,220
your least wishes.

1369
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,460
Here is seriousness, guarantee! I pay more than anyone!

1370
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:50,540
Look how gold flies! Catch it!

1371
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:51,940
Check it out! It's legit!

1372
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,260
Used to fake miracles, buy rockets, lights, wigs!

1373
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:56,580
It works for everything!

1374
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:01,260
You spoke of a section A: economic benefits.

1375
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,340
What is section B?

1376
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,940
Section B? Spiritual benefits.

1377
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:07,660
Hey, friends?

1378
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:09,980
Hear? An illustrious visitor has arrived.

1379
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,980
Do we have the right to play with them? What do you think?

1380
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,340
I'm not afraid.

1381
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,020
No fear, you know. I'm going to say it all.

1382
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,500
It's okay.

1383
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,540
Whoops.

1384
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,900
It has to be done, it is necessary.

1385
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,900
I am left wondering who you are. Will you tell me?

1386
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,540
Any day.

1387
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,420
I don't know where it will be. That is my secret.

1388
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,140
Listen to me!

1389
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,580
Hear me! Listen to me all!

1390
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,380
We try to deceive you!

1391
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,260
To all! To all!

1392
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,340
There was no miracle water!

1393
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,340
I'll tell you who San Dimas was!

1394
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,900
Look at it! We disguised it, it looked like!

1395
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,380
But we get scared!

1396
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:29,420
We thought it would be easy to fool you!

1397
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,740
And this was San Dimas, this!

1398
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,380
You, San Dimas?

1399
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,180
I, I have seen it! Carried light

1400
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,740
and a palm tree, it looked nothing like that.

1401
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,860
It is true! What she says is true!

1402
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:44,140
-We wanted to get rich! -We did it for Fontecilla!

1403
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,780
Not! Don't believe him! Don't believe him!

1404
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:50,420
I don't care to whom this is due, whether the apparition is true or a lie!

1405
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,540
Look, what I want is to take care of my daughter!

1406
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,580
I've come a long way, I sold it all!

1407
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,780
And whoever does the miracle must cure her!

1408
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,460
-Everything was false! -Invented by us!

1409
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:05,260
-Lie! Don't you see how I walk? -I asked him and he gave it back to me.

1410
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:08,420
And these hands, who has cured me?

1411
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:12,940
And I am cured. I had the fevers and look at me.

1412
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,180
I am already cured. I'm healthy.

1413
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,220
She is my daughter, heal her. She is sick.

1414
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:21,180
-Don't leave her. -I have healed

1415
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,020
with this miraculous San Dimas water.

1416
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,300
And it will heal your daughter too. Come with me, come all.

1417
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,620
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

1418
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,260
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

1419
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:10,300
You are miserable fooling everyone.

1420
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:11,620
(THEY SPEAK AT THE TIME)

1421
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,060
Martino, come down, help us! Do you hear me

1422
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,220
Martino! ¡Martino!

1423
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:23,500
It has to be here. Martino!

1424
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,660
Let's see, where is it?

1425
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,140
I want to see it. Where is?

1426
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:31,860
There is no one here, nor has there been in many years.

1427
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,100
-When have you seen it? -I was just a moment ago.

1428
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,220
Where is that Martino?

1429
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:39,580
-It was here. -Yes, just now.

1430
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:40,900
Miserables.

1431
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:44,340
-They are miserable. -There, look.

1432
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,060
"For Don Ramón, José, Evaristo, Antonio,

1433
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,180
Salvador and Don Manuel.

1434
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,380
One day I came to Fontecilla to clarify the mystery for them

1435
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:19,700
of a word that can do everything. His name is faith.

1436
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:26,820
They wanted to do business with her, not knowing that when they woke her up

1437
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,100
among the people, they woke me up.

1438
01:22:29,620 --> 01:22:32,940
If this faith also awakens them, my trip will have served for something.

1439
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,380
Tell Don Fidel that the San Dimas of his church

1440
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,700
it looks nothing like the original.

1441
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,660
Just in case you want to remember the image, I attach a photo

1442
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:44,220
and personal details of the authentic San Dimas.

1443
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:56,060
That! That's Martino!
