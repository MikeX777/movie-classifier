1
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:17,688
Damn!

2
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,111
Shooting coal

3
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:36,456
Shooting coal

4
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:14,889
Danny

5
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,870
- what in God's name are you doing?
- I got a shot set up back there.

6
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,813
Word's come down from Turley.

7
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,582
The tonnage rate?

8
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,353
They've brought it
down to 90 cent a ton.

9
00:03:26,996 --> 00:03:27,842
Down!

10
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,388
Those dagos
are holding fast in No. 3.

11
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:32,837
He says, "Take it or leave it."

12
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,624
Sephus, what we going to do?

13
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:55,135
<i>It was 1920 in the Southwest Field
and things were tough.</i>

14
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:58,406
<i>The miners were trying to
bring the union to West Virginia</i>

15
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,276
<i>and the coal operators and their
gun thugs were set on keeping them out.</i>

16
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,659
<i>They were hand-loading days.</i>

17
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,056
<i>They paid you by the ton</i>

18
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:38,859
<i>and they didn't care any more
for a man than they did for a draft mule</i>.

19
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:41,760
<i>They were hard people,
your coal miners then</i>.

20
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,229
<i>They weren't
anybody you wanted to cross</i>.

21
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:36,303
<i>So push come to shove, and pretty soon
we had us a war down there in Mingo County</i>

22
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,388
<i>which in those days
was known as "bloody Mingo".</i>

23
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:43,210
<i>And that's where it all
came to a head: there on Tug Fork</i>

24
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,960
<i>in the town of Matewan</i>.

25
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:57,849
We did it. mama.
We're going to have the union.

26
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:16,563
I've just got to stop for a little
repairs. Sorry for the inconvenience.

27
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:28,630
They shifted
Italians in, right off the boat

28
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,503
so they're still
bringing coal out of there.

29
00:06:30,602 --> 00:06:33,471
I'd sure hate to
get a whiff of that mine!

30
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,907
What the hell
are we stopping for?

31
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:54,445
Step down gentleman.
This here will be your new home.

32
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,520
How come,
we aren't getting off in town?

33
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,501
Just get in line.

34
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:09,878
I'm going to kill him!

35
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:18,342
Get on the train. Get on.

36
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,097
Come on, Bill.

37
00:08:34,284 --> 00:08:36,493
Come on, Bill.

38
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:38,094
Give me your hand, man.

39
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:43,878
Get out of here.

40
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,601
When do we get to Matewan?

41
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:56,930
You don't want to go there, mister.
It's nothing but crazy people.

42
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:23,656
Hi.

43
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:26,284
Hi.

44
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:34,520
Everybody was here.

45
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:37,775
Then they got word and
they went on up the line a ways:

46
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,114
some kind of union business.

47
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:42,125
Yeah. I saw.

48
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,013
You'd best steer clear of it.

49
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:47,953
My name's Bridey Mae Tolliver.

50
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,703
<i>uh</i>  Joe Kenehan.

51
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,472
<i>uh</i>  Do you know

52
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,106
Radnor's Boarding House?

53
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:57,625
The big white house

54
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:59,678
right on, past the coal dock.

55
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,907
She's a real sourpuss, though

56
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,412
Elma Radnor.

57
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,737
Thank you.

58
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:07,871
Are you going to
be in town long?

59
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:09,636
That depends.

60
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,332
I'll see you around.

61
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,520
I hope so.

62
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:09,652
These picks and shovels
are to be considered a loan

63
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,696
from the
Stone Mountain Coal Company.

64
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,262
Their costs will be deducted
from your first month's pay.

65
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:18,531
Tool-sharpeners provided
by the Company are 25 cents a month.

66
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:21,664
Use of the wash house
is 75 cents a month.

67
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:24,606
The medical doctor provided
by the Company is 2 dollars a month

68
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,342
special procedures: extra.

69
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,972
Your train ride here provided
by the Company will be deducted

70
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,169
from your first month's pay.

71
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,936
Your pay will be
issued as Company script

72
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,669
redeemable for all goods
and services at the Stone Mountain

73
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:39,996
Company Store.

74
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:43,015
Purchases of any items
available at the Company Store

75
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:44,756
from outside merchants

76
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:47,478
will result in
firing without pay.

77
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:50,242
What's to keep you from
jacking up them prices at your store?

78
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:52,952
Name?

79
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:55,332
Johnson.

80
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,000
They call me 'Few Clothes'.

81
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:02,333
Powder, fuses, lamps, head gear

82
00:12:02,383 --> 00:12:05,862
all appropriate clothing will be
available at the Company Store

83
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,592
and Stone Mountain
will generously advance you

84
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:10,304
a month's supply of these items

85
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,084
payment to be deducted.

86
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:15,079
I'm going to take you
over to camp now, where you'll be living.

87
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,972
There are some Italian gentlemen
that are very eager to meet you.

88
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:23,233
Rentals will be
for one room: $2.50 a month.

89
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,849
The Company rule:

90
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,205
no more than two people
to 1 room, children included.

91
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:31,320
Electricity,
where that is feasible

92
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,885
will be 1 dollar a month.

93
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,267
Mrs. Radnor?

94
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:46,310
Yes.

95
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,204
My name is Joe Kenehan.

96
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:56,154
I'm going to be in town for a bit
and your place here was recommended.

97
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:57,549
What do you do?

98
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:00,875
<i>uh</i>

99
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:03,665
I guess I'm looking for work.

100
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:04,800
Are you with the Company?

101
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:06,976
The Company?

102
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,383
If you aren't with the Company
there isn't any work.

103
00:13:12,737 --> 00:13:15,152
Look mister.
Don't act the lamb with me.

104
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,359
- What's your business here?
- Mama

105
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,657
Mama, it's Hillard.

106
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,676
Those scabs did it,
up the line a mile.

107
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,570
They were all colored this time.
They busted his nose.

108
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,486
Have you got any ice?

109
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:25,157
There's some in the back.

110
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:27,851
Go and fetch me two chunks
about this big and a piece of rag.

111
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:28,873
Are you a doctor?

112
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,696
No but I've seen
my share of broken noses.

113
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:36,295
Just put it up in the air, buddy,
just like you're watching the clouds.

114
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,385
We'll get that bleeding stopped.

115
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,513
<i>I ga my liggid</i> 

116
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:41,455
Say what?

117
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:42,952
He said, he's got his licks in.

118
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:45,034
It seems to be all
the men around here care about.

119
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:48,053
Wives and kids are starving, so
as long as they've got their licks in...

120
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:50,191
It's just frustration. That's all.

121
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,796
When you can't
take care of those you care about

122
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:53,981
I know. It isn't their fault.

123
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:54,832
Here you go.

124
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:58,027
This freezes up
all those little veins inside.

125
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,690
It's just so that they close up
and they don't let any more blood out.

126
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,703
Are you a doctor?

127
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:04,309
No.

128
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:08,349
I'm just a guy
looking for a place to stay.

129
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:11,328
5 dollars a week cash.

130
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,804
That includes
dinner and clean sheets.

131
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:16,599
I hope
I'm not making a mistake.

132
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:19,371
The name is Joe Kenehan.

133
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:29,276
Well, mostly I work for
the railroads, laying track.

134
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:30,748
Kansas, Missouri...

135
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:34,651
I went out west for a bit
and worked in a lumber camp

136
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:39,359
a little of whatever
pays an honest dollar.

137
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm a coal miner.

138
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:42,825
At least
until we came out I was.

139
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,426
I had me over in Section 3...
I was a trapper boy.

140
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,664
Aren't you a little young?

141
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,237
I'm almost 15.

142
00:14:49,715 --> 00:14:51,549
There are some in there
younger than me.

143
00:14:52,352 --> 00:14:54,823
Of course with the strike now
I mostly work on running this place.

144
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:56,651
I help a little, don't I?

145
00:14:58,224 --> 00:14:59,497
It's going to be a long one.

146
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:02,385
That superintendent
at Stone Mountain said

147
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:05,133
he'd go broke before
he let one union son of a bitch

148
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,642
so much as
step into his coal-mine.

149
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:09,415
- Danny
- Sorry, madam

150
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:10,799
but that's what he said.

151
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,863
Daniel is a preacher.

152
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:13,885
Is that so?

153
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:16,022
You ought to hear him testify.

154
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:17,702
What church are you with?

155
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,250
Well, around here
there's the missionary folks.

156
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,972
They're Hardshell Baptists.
And then there's the Free-Will folks

157
00:15:23,073 --> 00:15:25,053
which is your Softshell Baptists.

158
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:26,556
Right now I preach for both.

159
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:30,279
I'll get it.

160
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:34,573
Daniel is going to preach
tonight over at the missionary.

161
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,185
I never was religious myself.

162
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:40,361
It's Sephus, mama.

163
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:42,959
Hello, Elma.

164
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,123
Mrs. Knightes...

165
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:46,025
Hello, Sephus.

166
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,676
I've come to have
a word with your new boarder

167
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:52,536
if he doesn't mind.

168
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,039
Excuse me.

169
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,930
He claims, he's
the fellow the union sent us.

170
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:18,433
Can you prove it?

171
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,428
It doesn't take anything
to have a card printed up.

172
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:27,598
I guess
you'll just have to trust me.

173
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,717
Who wrote <i>The Iron Hill</i>?

174
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,125
Jack London.

175
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,861
Where's Joe Hill buried?

176
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:39,351
All over the world.
They scattered his ashes.

177
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,853
Which eye
is Big Bill Hayward missing?

178
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,084
His right one.

179
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:48,779
How did Frank Little die?

180
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,881
Butte, Montana: they
hanged him from a railroad trestle.

181
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,190
You know your stuff!

182
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,114
- I was with the Wobbley's.
- Me too

183
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,046
back when it meant something.

184
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:04,999
One big union!

185
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:06,818
Not around here buddy.

186
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:09,977
C.E. Lively...

187
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,538
This is my restaurant.

188
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:13,604
Fellows are waiting.

189
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:23,111
They don't give a damn
whether we live or die

190
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:25,722
just as long as they
get the coal out of the ground.

191
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:29,033
They had us pulling pillars
and the roof was working

192
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:31,763
you know, like it does
before it's going to fall down.

193
00:17:31,863 --> 00:17:35,263
If I say I'm not
dying in here, and walk away

194
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:37,463
they'll put me
down in some damn puddle

195
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:39,015
in a two foot seam

196
00:17:39,116 --> 00:17:40,980
and no air to breathe.

197
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:43,275
A man can't mine coal that way.

198
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:45,691
They're just pushing us
further than we can go.

199
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,258
The check wayman, he'll take
50 pound off your load for slate

200
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,777
when there isn't a pebble in it.

201
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,333
It's down in the bottom, he'll say,
where there isn't any looking for it.

202
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:54,619
Then they raise the prices
at the Company store

203
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:57,419
the same God damned week
that they lower the tonnage rate

204
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,241
and they still haven't
rock-dusted that damned hole.

205
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:02,448
- Who am I talking about?
- Jesus!

206
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,534
- I can't hear you!
- Jesus!

207
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,554
I still can't hear you!

208
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:10,277
Jesus Christ our Lord!
Do you know His name?

209
00:18:10,377 --> 00:18:12,473
Hallelujah! Say, "Yes, Glory"!

210
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:17,521
Have you felt the warming
comfort of His precious love?

211
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,744
Praise Jesus!

212
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:21,667
Praise His holy name!

213
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,845
Praise His blessed spirit!

214
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:29,277
Praise His everlasting love!
Jesus Christ our Lord!

215
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:32,611
Listen to me now.

216
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:37,781
The Prince of Darkness

217
00:18:40,104 --> 00:18:42,242
is upon the land.

218
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:44,134
Amen.

219
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,413
Now, in the Bible

220
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:51,225
his name is Beelzebub

221
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:54,293
Lord of the Flies.

222
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,348
Right now on earth today

223
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,579
his name is bolshevist!

224
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,688
socialist!, communist!, union man!

225
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:09,629
Lord of Untruth, Sower of Evil Seed!

226
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:13,184
Enemy of all
that is good and pure!

227
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:15,403
And this creature

228
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:19,932
walks among us.

229
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,129
Now, what are we
going to do about it?

230
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:52,713
The first thing
we've got to have

231
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,120
is all of these niggers
and all these dagos

232
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,700
that came in here
to take our jobs

233
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,774
thrown out of the mines.

234
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,884
Mines, hell!
They've got them in our houses!

235
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:01,792
They're sitting
at our tables right now

236
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,297
and they're sleeping in our beds

237
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:05,638
while we're out
living under a piece of canvas

238
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,028
at the back of the hollar.

239
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:09,203
I've been
a union man my whole life.

240
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:13,300
I know the story with these
coal operators and their gun thugs.

241
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,786
The only thing they understand
is the bad end of a bullet

242
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:18,607
and if we show them

243
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:20,547
we'd just as soon
blow up their damn mines

244
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:22,400
as see them
worked by a bunch of scabs

245
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,892
then they're going to listen.

246
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:25,693
Someone is coming.

247
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:28,059
It's Alex.  He's got someone.

248
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,293
Where did you find him?

249
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,645
He came
right up on the steps.

250
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:54,140
They told me that C.E. Lively's
is where the union men meet.

251
00:20:54,358 --> 00:20:54,982
So?

252
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:59,140
I've got
business with the union.

253
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,627
Is that so?

254
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:04,992
What's your name, son?

255
00:21:05,506 --> 00:21:08,111
They call me "Few Clothes".

256
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,258
I didn't come here
looking for any trouble.

257
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,304
A man's got to eat.

258
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:16,870
So why don't you go and eat
back where you came from?

259
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,730
They told me
that there were jobs here.

260
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:21,457
- Go home, nigger.
- God damned scab!

261
00:21:23,054 --> 00:21:25,352
You watch
your mouth, Peckerwood.

262
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:30,989
I've been called, "nigger"

263
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:32,811
and I can't help it that
that's the way white folks are

264
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:36,344
but I've not ever
been called a scab

265
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:39,874
and I'm not
fixing to start up now.

266
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:44,174
I'll go ton for ton,
loading coal with any man here

267
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:48,652
and when I do, I expect
the same dollar for the same work.

268
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:53,687
You get out of this hollar alive son,
and you be doing good for yourself.

269
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:00,402
"Union men", my ass!

270
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:12,550
Do you want to
be treated like men?

271
00:22:14,027 --> 00:22:15,723
Do you want to
be treated fairly?

272
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:19,786
Well, you aren't men
to that coal company.

273
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,572
You're equipment

274
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:26,495
like a shovel, a gondola car

275
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,722
and a hunk of wood brace.

276
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:33,818
They'll use you till you
wear out or you break down

277
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:37,573
or you're buried under a slate fall
and then they'll get a new one

278
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:41,818
and they don't care
what color it is or where it comes from.

279
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:45,225
It doesn't matter
how much coal you can load

280
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,963
or how long your family
has lived on this land.

281
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:50,113
If you stand alone

282
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:52,540
you're just so much
shit to those people.

283
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,889
Do you think
this man is your enemy?

284
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:03,970
<i>huh?</i>

285
00:23:06,063 --> 00:23:07,344
This is a worker.

286
00:23:09,578 --> 00:23:13,161
Any union that
keeps this man out isn't a union.

287
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:15,233
It's a God damned club!

288
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,143
Now they've got you
fighting white against colored

289
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:23,811
native against foreign,
hollar against hollar

290
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,136
when you know, there aren't
but two sides to this world:

291
00:23:27,357 --> 00:23:29,719
those that work
and those that don't.

292
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:30,686
You work.

293
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:32,046
They don't.

294
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:35,809
That's all you've got to
know about the enemy.

295
00:23:40,124 --> 00:23:41,970
You say, you've got guns.

296
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:51,341
Well I know that
you all are brave men

297
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:56,307
and I know you could shoot it out
with the company if you had to

298
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,844
but the coal company
don't want this union

299
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,488
and the state government
don't want it.

300
00:24:02,588 --> 00:24:04,274
The federal government
don't want it.

301
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:07,973
And they're all of them just
waiting for an excuse to come down

302
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,726
and crush us to nothing.

303
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:16,396
Fellows, we're in
a hole full of coal gas here.

304
00:24:17,996 --> 00:24:21,640
The tiniest spark at the wrong time
is going to be the end of us.

305
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:28,281
So we've got to pick away
at this situation, slow and careful.

306
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:33,073
We've got to
organize and build support.

307
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:36,095
We've got to work together.

308
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:37,588
Together!

309
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,912
Till they can't get their coal
out of the ground without us!

310
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,371
Because we're a union!

311
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:46,453
Because we're the workers damn it!
And we take care of each other!

312
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,502
How can we shut the mines down
if we don't dynamite them?

313
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,985
The men walk out

314
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:55,854
all of them...

315
00:24:59,752 --> 00:25:01,284
Fat chance!

316
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,988
And every man that
walks out on his own steam

317
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:14,613
we take into the union.

318
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:21,742
All the dagos
and all the coloreds?

319
00:25:24,073 --> 00:25:25,995
That's
what a union is, fellows.

320
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,917
You'd better get used to it.

321
00:25:30,936 --> 00:25:32,461
So this fellow owns a vineyard.

322
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:35,648
He goes out first thing one morning
and he hires some workers.

323
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:37,259
He says he'll give them
a dollar for the day

324
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:39,991
which was decent
wages in biblical times.

325
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,034
Well, then
he's at the marketplace

326
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,790
and he sees some
other fellows and he hires them

327
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:47,329
and some more at noon
and some at 2 and some at 5

328
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:50,825
and every time, it's
the same deal: a dollar for the day.

329
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:54,489
And he's hiring all day long,
right up till 1 hour before quitting time.

330
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:08,246
Look. We're really
sorry to barge in on you like this

331
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:11,422
but it's come to a point
where we've got to talk to you.

332
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:15,966
Now I know you people have
got it hard, coming to a new country.

333
00:26:16,066 --> 00:26:17,648
You don't know the rules.

334
00:26:18,364 --> 00:26:19,915
You don't know how things work.

335
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:23,124
They don't know shit
about mining coal. That's for sure!

336
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:26,661
They've been dying
like flies in that No. 3 hole.

337
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:29,985
But how it is:

338
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,242
you don't have
a whole lot of choice in this thing.

339
00:26:34,413 --> 00:26:36,201
Do you know
what a union is?

340
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:39,877
<i>- Sindacato.</i>
- "Sindacato"?

341
00:26:39,977 --> 00:26:41,965
What the situation is

342
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,662
- we need every
- If we join the union

343
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:45,963
they'll shoot us.

344
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:49,348
If we don't join the union,
you'll shoot us.

345
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,883
Well, that's
one way of looking at it.

346
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:31,427
That dago's
just driving me crazy.

347
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:34,870
- Now what's he playing  <i>- sh</i> 

348
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,604
Now who's that?

349
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:10,977
Peckerwood's gone past.

350
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:14,489
A union man
will be up in a few minutes.

351
00:28:15,643 --> 00:28:17,277
What are we
talking to him for?

352
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:20,086
Do you want to
walk back to Alabama?

353
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:25,200
The sun goes down and he
sends for his foreman and he says to

354
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,806
go and pay off the workers

355
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,909
starting with the ones
he picked up just an hour ago

356
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,186
and to pay every one of them
the same dollar a day.

357
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,292
And of course
the fellows that went out first

358
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:36,057
are roped off about this

359
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:37,836
so they get to agitating

360
00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:39,818
complaining so loud that
the owner comes up

361
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,380
and he says, "Look."

362
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:45,304
"We dealt for a dollar
and that's what you get"

363
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:49,073
"and what I pay anybody else
is none of your look-out. So there!"

364
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:52,617
Now that's
all the gospel story says

365
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:55,210
except for the moral
Jesus drew out of it.

366
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:58,082
And so Jesus says

367
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,566
"Thus it will be
in the kingdom of heaven."

368
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:04,278
"The first will be last
and the last will be first."

369
00:29:06,268 --> 00:29:08,513
Now it's clear
from this parable

370
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:11,245
that Jesus hadn't
heard anything about the union.

371
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:14,371
If he was walking the earth today
and had seen the situation we've got

372
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,235
with these coal operators,
he would have changed his tune.

373
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:19,311
"A man deserveth
an hourly wage," he'd say

374
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:22,031
"for though the pit be gassy
and the face full of slate"

375
00:29:22,131 --> 00:29:24,585
"a man still toileth
by the sweat of his brow"

376
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,494
"and wants
a better deal here on earth"

377
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:29,453
"no matter what I've got
in store for him in the hereafter."

378
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,649
Praise Jesus!

379
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:35,252
Kenehan

380
00:29:39,463 --> 00:29:41,265
out kind of late, aren't you?

381
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,763
I met some people
and we got to talking.

382
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:47,315
Talking?

383
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:49,932
Yeah.

384
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,936
Who are you?

385
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:55,954
The name is Sid Hatfield.

386
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:58,713
I'm chief of police around here.

387
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,954
It isn't against the law
to talk, is it?

388
00:30:04,557 --> 00:30:05,355
It depends.

389
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:14,388
I take care of my people.

390
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,254
You bring them trouble,
and you're a dead man.

391
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:26,428
Sleep tight, Kenehan.

392
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:32,661
Hi.

393
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:37,230
Well, look at this, Griggsy.

394
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:39,825
They've got up a little
reception committee for us.

395
00:31:48,018 --> 00:31:50,034
What is your name, honey?

396
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,682
Bridey Mae Tolliver.

397
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,227
Do you like to watch
the trains come and go, Bridey Mae?

398
00:31:58,053 --> 00:31:58,970
Yeah.

399
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:02,563
And the people
that come into town.

400
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:06,201
Have there been a lot of
new people coming here lately?

401
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,300
A few.

402
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,723
Did a fellow
named Joe Kenehan show up?

403
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:16,249
Maybe.

404
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:20,413
Are you married, Bridey Mae?

405
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,167
I was.

406
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,078
He got killed in the mine.

407
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,620
That's too bad.

408
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:31,693
Did you hear that, Griggsy?
He got killed in the mine.

409
00:32:31,793 --> 00:32:32,749
It's a shame.

410
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:38,919
Was your husband
a union man while he was living?

411
00:32:39,062 --> 00:32:42,367
No. He said, it wouldn't
ever take hold down here.

412
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,944
He sounds like a smart fellow.

413
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:53,381
I think that you are really pretty.
Do you know that, Bridey Mae?

414
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:55,778
Thank you.

415
00:32:58,249 --> 00:33:00,850
Don't you think
she's pretty, Griggsy?

416
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:08,797
You are
the best looking mountain trash

417
00:33:08,896 --> 00:33:11,732
I've seen in a long while.

418
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:17,722
We'll see you around.

419
00:33:22,661 --> 00:33:24,415
Let's roll, Griggsy.

420
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:29,421
The sooner we get out of
this shit hole the better.

421
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,371
I was putting up blackberries
when Tremel Blankenship come

422
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:50,488
shouting up the hollar
that the No. 5 had blown.

423
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:54,973
I remember I took
the pot off the stovetop

424
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:57,658
and washed up my hands
before I went down.

425
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,014
It took 2 days
to dig through.

426
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:07,251
Then when they brought them up,
you couldn't tell which was which.

427
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:12,237
They found blood on the walls from
fellows trying to claw their way out.

428
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:17,906
Mrs. Elkins,
Mrs. Mounts, Bridey Mae, me

429
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,187
we all lost our men in that fire.

430
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,826
Danny was seven then.

431
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,143
Now he's
back in that same hole.

432
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,284
How did it start?

433
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:37,283
Coal dust gets hanging in the air
down there and there's a spark.

434
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,371
They could
spray the walls down

435
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:41,723
but the company says
that'd cost too much.

436
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:45,540
Hey. Was

437
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:48,225
was Sid Hatfield
ever a miner?

438
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:51,864
Not for long.  He doesn't
like to be closed in, Sid.

439
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,217
He's always
really friendly, smiling Sid.

440
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:57,950
Then the war came.

441
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:00,948
Cabell Testerman
got to be the mayor.

442
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:05,435
He made Sid, chief of police
and then the girl that Cabell married

443
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:06,613
Well

444
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:16,145
I don't want you using Danny
on any crazy union business.

445
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:19,165
A man has to stand up for
what he believes in.

446
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:21,265
Danny isn't any man.

447
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,810
Look, mister.
You're going to be moving on.

448
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:28,794
Win or lose, you're going to
walk on out of this hollar

449
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,584
and we've got to stay here.

450
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:33,252
I intend to
leave a union when I go.

451
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:35,823
My husband
used to talk union.

452
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:38,435
I saw where it got him.

453
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,203
Mama!  People out the front, mama.

454
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,225
Sorry, mister. We're full up.

455
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:57,859
Not any more,
you're not, sonny.

456
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:59,674
Stone Mountain
sent us down here.

457
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:01,176
We're still full up.

458
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,991
Can I help you gentleman?

459
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:04,459
These two are trying to
push their way in here.

460
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:05,998
I told them
there wasn't any use.

461
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:07,752
I don't see where you've got
any say in the matter.

462
00:36:07,852 --> 00:36:10,448
If my mama says you can't stay here
then you can't, that's all.

463
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:11,176
Danny

464
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:12,393
Keep out of this.

465
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:15,531
Look. I've only got
one room left.

466
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,346
Well then, somebody is
going to have to move, aren't they?

467
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:20,125
Let me see your register.

468
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:22,033
You aren't seeing anything.

469
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:27,629
Lady, we're here as guests of
the Stone Mountain Coal Company.

470
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,156
They own this house.

471
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,720
Good morning.

472
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:33,739
Are you fellows moving in?

473
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,609
- Yeah.  - No.

474
00:36:36,138 --> 00:36:39,526
Well, you won't find a better
night's sleep anywhere else in town.

475
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:45,397
It's a shame I've got to move
over to the hotel. It's business, you know.

476
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,537
So would you mind if
I settle my bill, madam?

477
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:54,883
Danny, you sign
these two gentleman in.

478
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:03,975
Don't think the Company
isn't going to hear about this!

479
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:20,620
Boy, sometimes you've got to
bend so that you don't break.

480
00:37:22,754 --> 00:37:24,975
The food's awful at the hotel.

481
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,516
The mattresses have got lumps

482
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:29,567
probably cooties, too.

483
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:33,589
I'll be all right.

484
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,551
I'll get my things.

485
00:37:38,374 --> 00:37:39,234
Thank you.

486
00:37:47,908 --> 00:37:50,708
Now, if you want to
stay alive down here

487
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:54,429
you've got to listen up,
get a hold of something solid

488
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:57,178
and give the top
a little poke.

489
00:37:57,513 --> 00:38:01,225
Now, if you get a nice
ringing sound, you're all set.

490
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,495
You've got a nice
solid top over your head.

491
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:10,551
You get
a kind of hollow sound

492
00:38:10,883 --> 00:38:14,845
like a drum:
that's slate sagging a bit

493
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:17,877
and you've
got to put in another post.

494
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,266
Have you dug coal a long time?

495
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:22,654
Since I was 10. And you?

496
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,356
We make a shoe. Everybody
in the same <i>fabricca</i>  in Milano

497
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:28,777
make a shoe.

498
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,497
Shoe<b>s</b>.

499
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,958
You make-a shoe<b>s</b>.

500
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,330
As soon as they get that union
they'll send us back.

501
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,533
It could be

502
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,283
but you try and
head out of here now

503
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,723
and you'll be owing
all that money. Like they say

504
00:38:48,823 --> 00:38:50,747
The company will
shoot you for a thief.

505
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:55,741
We're just some slaves up here.
They own our black asses.

506
00:38:57,217 --> 00:38:58,217
Gentleman...

507
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,598
Hey, Few.
I've got a question for you.

508
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,106
Yes?

509
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,243
Now suppose they let us
in this union, like they say.

510
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,798
Are we going to have to
work with those Italian people?

511
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:26,917
Come on, babies.

512
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:30,828
Come on and get it now. Come on.

513
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,216
Come on now.

514
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:40,571
Oh, boy.

515
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:41,391
All right.

516
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:43,301
Taking a walk?

517
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:44,243
Hi.

518
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:47,337
I'm going up to the coal camp

519
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:50,375
to meet those new fellows
when they come off their shift.

520
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:54,696
You're doing
union business, aren't you?

521
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,413
How do you like Mrs. Radnor's?

522
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,612
Well there wasn't room.

523
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:03,618
I'm at the hotel now.

524
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:05,654
Isn't she a sourpuss though?

525
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,757
Mr. Kenehan

526
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:11,031
They're evicting
in town, Mr. Kenehan.

527
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:12,221
It's Baldwin.

528
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:14,473
It's those Baldwin thugs.

529
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,975
This is town property.

530
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,185
Who are you?

531
00:41:00,979 --> 00:41:02,018
I'm the mayor.

532
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:05,013
Well, pleased to meet you!

533
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:06,984
My name is Bill Hickey.

534
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:08,952
This is Tom Griggs.

535
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,607
We're carrying out
an eviction for Stone Mountain.

536
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:14,330
You can do what you want
up at the coal camp

537
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:16,328
but this is town property.

538
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:19,710
Stone Mountain holds
the deeds on these houses, Cabell.

539
00:41:20,692 --> 00:41:22,361
You need a writ for an eviction.

540
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:26,321
Are you the law around here?

541
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,145
Well, good!

542
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:30,419
Then you can help us.

543
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,770
Now these people are
trespassing on Company property.

544
00:41:33,971 --> 00:41:37,106
They all signed a contract
that they wouldn't join any union.

545
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:38,203
Are you...

546
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,076
are you
Baldwin-Felts Agency?

547
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:42,595
That's right

548
00:41:44,564 --> 00:41:47,696
presently employed by
the Stone Mountain Coal Company.

549
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,723
This is from Mr. Turley here

550
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:55,870
and this is from our boss

551
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:57,616
Mr. Thomas Felts.

552
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,665
I've met Mr. Felts.

553
00:42:02,738 --> 00:42:05,373
Well, good!
We won't have any problem.

554
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:08,691
I wouldn't pee on him
if his heart was on fire.

555
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,920
Neither of these
will do for a writ.

556
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,879
You'll have to
see a judge in Charleston.

557
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,748
What if we haven't
got time to go to Charleston?

558
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:24,087
Then you'd better find some.

559
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:28,683
Now I can't do anything about
what you pull outside town limits

560
00:42:29,064 --> 00:42:31,187
but you bother these people
under my jurisdiction

561
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:32,856
and I'll put you under arrest.

562
00:42:33,703 --> 00:42:34,388
Yeah?

563
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:36,605
You and whose army?

564
00:42:41,953 --> 00:42:44,019
All you men who own a gun

565
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,511
go home and get it.

566
00:42:46,645 --> 00:42:48,315
You're deputies as of now.

567
00:42:51,038 --> 00:42:52,775
The rest of you people,
stick close.

568
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:53,964
We'll need witnesses.

569
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,096
I'm giving you 10 minutes

570
00:42:58,196 --> 00:43:00,290
to get those people's belongings
back in the house.

571
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:03,301
If the rest of the boys were here
you wouldn't be so cocky.

572
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:08,205
If the rest of the boys were here,
I'd give you 5 minutes.

573
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:10,368
Now move it.

574
00:43:27,345 --> 00:43:28,987
You can't win, you know.

575
00:43:29,671 --> 00:43:32,749
This is going to
happen with you or without you.

576
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:34,541
You can't stop it.

577
00:43:38,673 --> 00:43:40,123
All right boys.

578
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:42,044
Let's put it back in.

579
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,502
This isn't our day!

580
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,291
That a boy, Sid!

581
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:02,894
I've never seen a law man
buck a company gun before.

582
00:44:08,893 --> 00:44:11,272
He's mostly
a really nice fellow, is Sid.

583
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,528
I may be mayor of the town
but I'm going to be mayor of a cemetery.

584
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,689
Contention
makes him nervous, though.

585
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,739
We've got
a motion on the floor here

586
00:44:24,422 --> 00:44:26,422
and this is coal miners only.

587
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:34,179
All those in favor of
keeping those scabs out of the mines

588
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:38,667
tomorrow morning, using whatever
force it looks like is necessary

589
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:41,805
raise your hands.

590
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:54,028
It's settled then.

591
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:00,787
Pass those peas, boy.

592
00:45:07,868 --> 00:45:09,321
Pass the peas, Danny.

593
00:45:12,096 --> 00:45:14,162
Is your boy
deaf or dumb or what?

594
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:17,321
Daniel isn't dumb.
Daniel's a preacher.

595
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,468
Is that right, boy?
Are you a preacher?

596
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:24,408
What do you
preach to, boy? Squirrels?

597
00:45:24,682 --> 00:45:27,317
Daniel preached
at the meeting last night.

598
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:29,714
It was
a good number of souls there.

599
00:45:29,848 --> 00:45:31,562
Are you a soul-saver, boy?

600
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:38,841
You want to have a go at me and Griggsy here.
We ought to be be a real challenge.

601
00:45:39,656 --> 00:45:41,509
He's a squirrel preacher, is what

602
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:43,884
stands up
on a stump out in the woods and

603
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:45,982
testifies to the holy rodent.

604
00:45:46,082 --> 00:45:46,708
Danny

605
00:45:46,808 --> 00:45:49,087
are you in a hurry to
meet your maker, boy?

606
00:45:50,743 --> 00:45:52,877
There aren't
any guns allowed at table.

607
00:45:52,977 --> 00:45:54,328
You sit down, Danny.

608
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:02,207
You do what
your pretty mama says, preacher.

609
00:46:13,343 --> 00:46:14,862
You put that away now, mister.

610
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:18,966
Pack it away, Griggsy.

611
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:22,549
Look.

612
00:46:23,015 --> 00:46:24,754
We're going to be
here a while, little lady.

613
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:27,217
You can have it
the easy way or the hard way.

614
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:31,210
Now, how about those peas?

615
00:46:38,258 --> 00:46:40,343
The boy's getting on my nerves.

616
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:57,794
Oh Lord.

617
00:46:58,323 --> 00:47:00,556
They told me
they would talk to the fellows.

618
00:47:00,596 --> 00:47:03,000
I saw
their faces last night, Joe.

619
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,200
They weren't buying it.

620
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:06,118
We're playing
right into the company's plans.

621
00:47:06,218 --> 00:47:09,109
The men voted, Joe.
What more do you want?

622
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:15,877
I've seen
the lights on the hill.

623
00:47:16,114 --> 00:47:18,045
They're sneaking them in
for a night shift.

624
00:47:22,031 --> 00:47:23,565
Let's go, fellows.

625
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,596
Keller told me,
you're sent from the union.

626
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:36,462
<i>uh-huh</i> 

627
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:39,229
I bet you've seen
hundreds of strikes.

628
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:40,368
Yeah.

629
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:43,464
I got thrown clear out of
the missionary the other night

630
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:45,828
talking the union
from the pulpit.

631
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:48,107
Are we getting close?

632
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,113
Up there...

633
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:03,712
They're down the hill.

634
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:04,949
Over here...

635
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:03,774
When our fellows
put their lanterns out

636
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,533
you just hit the dirt.

637
00:49:38,057 --> 00:49:39,808
I think, this belongs to you.

638
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,324
I'm with him.

639
00:49:58,201 --> 00:50:00,109
All of you union men

640
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,366
let's welcome our new brothers.

641
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:13,687
From now on

642
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,638
Stone Mountain doesn't
move one piece of coal

643
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,919
unless it's
a union man that moves it.

644
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:23,995
Let's get out of here.

645
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:40,444
Glad you could join us! 

646
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,770
<i>In those days the coal company
owned your camp houses.</i>

647
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:13,245
<i>They owned your land.
They owned most of the town</i>

648
00:51:13,345 --> 00:51:14,913
<i>and the people who ran it</i>.

649
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:17,171
<i>If you weren't for the company</i>

650
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,087
<i>there weren't too many places
you could go that were still on the map.</i>

651
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,442
<i>The union didn't have too much</i>

652
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:41,960
<i>they could
give to the people back then.</i>

653
00:51:42,247 --> 00:51:44,395
<i>"All we've got
in common is our misery"</i>

654
00:51:44,495 --> 00:51:46,598
<i>Joe Kenehan used to say</i>

655
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,416
<i>"and the least
we can do is, share it."</i>

656
00:52:23,725 --> 00:52:25,299
She's got
the evil eye, that one.

657
00:52:28,361 --> 00:52:29,855
Oh, mama.

658
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:31,551
Don't you let me
catch you peeking over there.

659
00:52:31,652 --> 00:52:33,888
She's got the evil eye
if I've ever seen it.

660
00:52:39,678 --> 00:52:41,406
Well, what have we got here?

661
00:52:41,554 --> 00:52:44,174
We've brought you some food.
Mama stole it from the company.

662
00:52:44,225 --> 00:52:45,319
Quiet, Danny.

663
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:47,527
Well, we can use
everything you've got.

664
00:52:48,283 --> 00:52:50,830
You people are crazy! You aren't
ever going to win this thing.

665
00:52:51,306 --> 00:52:53,016
Then what are you helping us for?

666
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,942
I've got work to do.

667
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:02,154
We appreciate your help.

668
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,741
I've not ever seen
everybody all together like this.

669
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,420
The company doesn't stand a chance.

670
00:53:52,245 --> 00:53:53,160
Jessie

671
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:10,991
what's the pitch?

672
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:16,428
Well I was just
saying to the mayor here how

673
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:19,526
we're all trying to do our jobs

674
00:54:19,745 --> 00:54:22,298
you, and me and him

675
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:27,391
and nobody is paying us enough
to be dodging any bullets for it.

676
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,958
<i>um</i>  Now

677
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:36,785
Mr. Felts
has authorized me to

678
00:54:37,147 --> 00:54:40,984
make it more attractive
for you gentleman to cooperate.

679
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,435
The town isn't for sale, mister.

680
00:54:47,602 --> 00:54:48,996
What about you?

681
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:53,018
Now, I figured that

682
00:54:53,192 --> 00:54:56,343
little show you were putting on
out there the other day was

683
00:54:56,442 --> 00:54:58,404
just for bargaining power.

684
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:02,892
Or are you
going to be stupid, too?

685
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:17,359
If either of you shit hogs
lift a finger in town limits

686
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:19,317
I'll put you away.

687
00:55:26,486 --> 00:55:29,585
Damn hillbillies! They've
always got to do it the hard way.

688
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:39,826
You boys
are going up against some

689
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,468
pretty big people.

690
00:55:55,473 --> 00:55:57,029
Don't push your luck.

691
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:16,230
How's Jessie these days?

692
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,538
Oh she's OK, Sid.

693
00:56:20,392 --> 00:56:21,881
Do you think, they're bluffing?

694
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,218
No.

695
00:56:27,506 --> 00:56:29,008
Neither am I.

696
00:56:34,365 --> 00:56:37,796
Now, the way the relief fund works
is kind of tricky

697
00:56:38,517 --> 00:56:42,613
because with all the different situations
we've got going around the country

698
00:56:43,585 --> 00:56:45,516
we're stretched really thin.

699
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:49,305
There's a lot of strategy
to who gets what and when.

700
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,482
I report to the strike committee.

701
00:56:52,093 --> 00:56:54,323
They evaluate
the progress we're making here

702
00:56:54,423 --> 00:56:55,955
and the political situation

703
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,395
and then they release
the strike fund to us.

704
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,122
Do you mean, they'd cut us off?

705
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,696
No. The amount we get is based on

706
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,121
What if they
think we're going to lose?

707
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:10,272
Look. The strike committee
considers what's best

708
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,275
for the union as a whole
but that doesn't mean

709
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:14,185
Politics, boys!

710
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:17,792
If you're going to play union,
you've got to play politics.

711
00:57:18,475 --> 00:57:20,942
I'm sure Joe doesn't like that
any more than you do.

712
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:33,817
I don't like it one damn bit.

713
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:36,344
Me either. I didn't
get into this thing so that I could have

714
00:58:36,444 --> 00:58:38,420
one more boss
to tell me what to do.

715
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,234
The union isn't your boss. It's you.

716
00:58:40,335 --> 00:58:42,258
Then why have we got to wait

717
00:58:42,308 --> 00:58:45,504
for some hunkies up in Pittsburgh
to give us the word to move?

718
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,857
Because it's a democracy.

719
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:49,962
It's like the United States:

720
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:51,019
a democracy.

721
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,262
That's a joke.

722
00:58:52,669 --> 00:58:53,468
Quiet.

723
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,045
Get down. They're shooting.

724
00:59:10,515 --> 00:59:12,134
Just keep your head down, son.

725
00:59:13,743 --> 00:59:15,192
They're going to make a night of it.

726
00:59:34,317 --> 00:59:35,959
Sarah, you come over here.

727
00:59:36,058 --> 00:59:38,121
I think you've just got
a little piece of bullet left in there.

728
00:59:39,433 --> 00:59:41,499
The company doctor
said he wouldn't come out

729
00:59:42,361 --> 00:59:44,728
but there's a fellow
in Pikeville on the Kentucky side

730
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:47,573
that'll treat union men on the sly.

731
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,982
He'll be here by noon.

732
00:59:50,856 --> 00:59:52,200
Will he treat colored?

733
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:55,118
If he treats union,
he'll treat colored.

734
00:59:55,651 --> 00:59:57,774
- More water, Danny.
- Yes, madam.

735
00:59:58,225 --> 01:00:00,696
You just hold this up there
against that, really gently.

736
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:02,502
- Don't press hard.
- Hey, Elma.

737
01:00:03,393 --> 01:00:05,017
Have you seen any of the men?

738
01:00:07,008 --> 01:00:08,621
Only those that are wounded.

739
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:12,307
How's she doing?

740
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:13,703
Not bad.

741
01:00:13,853 --> 01:00:15,658
At least nobody got killed.

742
01:00:16,357 --> 01:00:17,766
No thanks to you!

743
01:00:19,777 --> 01:00:21,104
Take it easy, buddy.

744
01:00:22,156 --> 01:00:23,553
Good morning, Joe.

745
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,674
Hey, Bridey.

746
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:26,384
Have you seen any of the fellows?

747
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:27,821
Not a one.

748
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,471
He's really nice looking.

749
01:00:33,703 --> 01:00:36,412
He likes me. I can tell.

750
01:00:36,604 --> 01:00:37,548
How?

751
01:00:38,299 --> 01:00:40,517
I just know men. That's all.

752
01:00:41,145 --> 01:00:43,047
That'd make a cat laugh.

753
01:00:45,387 --> 01:00:47,153
If you want to
make that kind of slop

754
01:00:47,252 --> 01:00:50,404
for dinner,
you go back home and make it.

755
01:00:50,504 --> 01:00:53,745
This is the United States here
and we do things differently.

756
01:00:53,845 --> 01:00:58,055
Listen to me.
You can learn something here.

757
01:00:59,395 --> 01:01:01,625
Come on ladies.
What's the problem here?

758
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:04,908
I thought she was going to
make up some cornbread with it.

759
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:07,589
Well, you should see
the slop she came up with!

760
01:01:10,353 --> 01:01:11,366
Miss Elkins

761
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,897
these people have got
their own way of doing things.

762
01:01:13,997 --> 01:01:17,143
Well, that is a waste of
good corn meal, if you ask me.

763
01:01:17,243 --> 01:01:18,998
She makes up
this porridgy kind of mess...

764
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:20,413
I wouldn't feed it to the pigs!

765
01:01:20,513 --> 01:01:21,182
Ascoltate

766
01:01:29,944 --> 01:01:31,502
where have all the men gone to?

767
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:40,450
That changes the whole picture.

768
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:45,788
What I'm saying is,
unions are fine for some things

769
01:01:46,031 --> 01:01:48,702
but for other things
a man's got to go on his own.

770
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:51,565
Of course that's up to you.

771
01:01:53,775 --> 01:01:54,774
Roscoe

772
01:01:59,814 --> 01:02:01,379
you make <i>sindacato</i>

773
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,263
you do what the <i>sindacato</i>  say.

774
01:02:05,745 --> 01:02:07,051
I listen to Joe.

775
01:02:09,868 --> 01:02:10,855
Few Clothes?

776
01:02:12,757 --> 01:02:15,205
We're going to be
shooting white folks, right?

777
01:02:16,219 --> 01:02:17,328
That's the idea.

778
01:02:19,763 --> 01:02:22,375
If people hear about
black folks shooting white folks

779
01:02:22,555 --> 01:02:23,899
no matter what it's for

780
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,075
there's going to be hell to pay.

781
01:02:27,698 --> 01:02:28,714
You've got a point.

782
01:02:31,587 --> 01:02:32,470
Well then

783
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,540
if you gentleman will excuse us

784
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:41,387
<i>andiamo.</i>

785
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:49,783
You people

786
01:02:50,589 --> 01:02:54,064
have been put out of
Stone Mountain Mine housing

787
01:02:54,973 --> 01:03:00,093
and some of you have seen fit to
take along certain items

788
01:03:00,275 --> 01:03:02,752
of food, furniture and clothing

789
01:03:02,852 --> 01:03:05,281
that don't belong to you
but belong to the Company.

790
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,676
As of the day of the strike

791
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:15,401
your script ceased to
be legal tender, meaning

792
01:03:15,663 --> 01:03:18,647
that any item of
food, clothing, and furniture

793
01:03:18,747 --> 01:03:21,737
not paid for in cash money

794
01:03:22,871 --> 01:03:25,054
must be turned over to me

795
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:27,118
and my deputies

796
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:30,343
and I suggest that
you all cooperate.

797
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,181
You see... my boys

798
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:36,138
they didn't
get much sleep last night

799
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,170
so they're kind of jumpy.

800
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,327
Besides

801
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,404
we've got the law on our side.

802
01:03:43,504 --> 01:03:47,020
You aren't any law!
You've got to slip around the real law.

803
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:50,071
You've just got guns. That's all.

804
01:03:50,413 --> 01:03:52,069
You're just thugs.

805
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:56,208
Yeah. Maybe your right, sonny.

806
01:03:56,308 --> 01:03:57,891
We've just got guns

807
01:03:58,821 --> 01:04:01,303
and you've still
got to hand in those goods.

808
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:04,012
You yellow scab-herder, you!

809
01:04:05,944 --> 01:04:07,770
Hillard, you get up from there.   

810
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,621
Have you got a list of goods?

811
01:04:12,555 --> 01:04:13,808
I don't need one.

812
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,228
How you going to know what belongs
to the company and what doesn't?

813
01:04:18,163 --> 01:04:19,642
He's the red, Hickey.

814
01:04:21,516 --> 01:04:22,828
He's the agitator.

815
01:04:26,957 --> 01:04:29,832
Everybody, you see.
I haven't got a gun on me.

816
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,952
What good do you think
that's going to do you, red?

817
01:04:40,285 --> 01:04:43,004
You shoot me, and
folks will know, it was murder.

818
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:46,692
Well, that's some cold comfort.

819
01:04:48,183 --> 01:04:50,522
Now you listen to me, red.

820
01:05:08,682 --> 01:05:10,031
We were hunting.

821
01:05:12,953 --> 01:05:15,352
You folks are making
an awful lot of commotion.

822
01:05:15,452 --> 01:05:17,607
You scared all the game away.

823
01:05:19,171 --> 01:05:20,698
Is this your machine?

824
01:05:22,356 --> 01:05:24,218
I heard it last night, too.

825
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:26,616
It's an offense to the ear.

826
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:29,801
Hold it pops.
You're talking to the law here.

827
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:32,928
Did he ask you anything?

828
01:05:34,299 --> 01:05:36,136
Where did you get that thing, pal?

829
01:05:36,236 --> 01:05:37,667
The Spanish war?

830
01:05:41,196 --> 01:05:41,888
No.

831
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:46,041
The war between the states.

832
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:50,766
You all, get in this machine and
get back into town where you belong.

833
01:05:51,183 --> 01:05:55,336
There isn't but one law out here
and that's the law of nature.

834
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:00,720
Let's get the hell out of here.

835
01:06:24,756 --> 01:06:27,788
You folks try and keep
the noise down and you'll do fine.

836
01:06:28,887 --> 01:06:31,133
Help yourself to
the bird and the rabbit.

837
01:06:32,144 --> 01:06:34,788
If you see any hogs,
they're probably ours.

838
01:06:34,962 --> 01:06:37,083
We'd appreciate it
if you'd leave them be.

839
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:39,549
Good day to you.

840
01:06:51,086 --> 01:06:52,459
Are you OK, Joe?

841
01:06:52,924 --> 01:06:55,710
Yeah. I'd be all right
if it weren't for my ribs.

842
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:57,921
Who were those people?

843
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,458
Rossums, mostly

844
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:00,926
and a Shuttleworth.

845
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:05,524
- Are they miners  - No.
You'll never find those folks near a hole.

846
01:07:05,624 --> 01:07:07,604
They've had most of their land
stolen by the company.

847
01:07:07,703 --> 01:07:10,051
- They're hill people.
- Foothill people, really.

848
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:12,066
Your genuine hill people

849
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:13,910
can be dangerous.

850
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:25,388
Now the thing
you've got to remember, son

851
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:28,124
is, your fuse
burns one foot per minute.

852
01:07:28,884 --> 01:07:31,511
Make it too long,
and they might see it.

853
01:07:32,897 --> 01:07:34,171
Make it too short

854
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:37,549
and we'll all be
meeting you on the other side.

855
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:52,884
Damn it!

856
01:08:00,984 --> 01:08:03,091
Air shaft No. 4.

857
01:08:04,076 --> 01:08:05,526
Go out the back way.

858
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,350
Where are all our
other friends tonight, Miss Elma?

859
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:36,743
Did they get
tired of the chuck, or what?

860
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:40,480
I think
that old bitty went on strike

861
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:42,640
and laid down her teeth in protest.

862
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,390
They're just
particular about who they eat with.

863
01:08:45,636 --> 01:08:47,169
What about you, Miss Elma?

864
01:08:48,221 --> 01:08:49,535
Are you particular?

865
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:53,557
If Stone Mountain didn't
hold the lease here, you two

866
01:08:53,658 --> 01:08:55,979
if Stone Mountain didn't hold the
lease here, you'd be peddling puntang

867
01:08:56,078 --> 01:08:58,729
down in Cinder Bottom,
so just shut your mouth about it.

868
01:09:11,082 --> 01:09:13,256
Where's your
little preacher tonight?

869
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:30,781
The bitch has got no table manners.

870
01:09:45,024 --> 01:09:45,939
Elma

871
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:53,314
do you know where Danny is?

872
01:09:55,144 --> 01:09:57,719
No. I don't know where anybody is

873
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:00,605
and nobody wants to tell me either.

874
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:04,846
Are you OK?

875
01:10:05,011 --> 01:10:06,953
Yeah, just tired. That's all.

876
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:11,496
I've been working all day.
This place

877
01:10:14,656 --> 01:10:15,940
I've been working

878
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:23,971
the day they burned my husband,
I started and I've been working and

879
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,599
it doesn't ever stop.

880
01:10:27,931 --> 01:10:29,143
I get so tired

881
01:10:30,163 --> 01:10:31,153
and

882
01:10:32,442 --> 01:10:34,840
- there isn't anybody.
- Look. It's hard.

883
01:10:36,415 --> 01:10:38,022
It's hard being on your own.

884
01:10:46,462 --> 01:10:48,765
You don't know anything about it.

885
01:10:51,712 --> 01:10:54,067
We're in business, buddy.
Let's get going.

886
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:04,813
What is it?

887
01:11:04,913 --> 01:11:07,198
It sounds like
dynamite up at the mine.

888
01:11:07,299 --> 01:11:09,395
It might be that No. 5 shaft.

889
01:11:22,448 --> 01:11:24,393
It might be some shooting.

890
01:11:28,474 --> 01:11:29,654
Hillard!

891
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:32,243
Hillard!

892
01:11:33,425 --> 01:11:34,893
Have you seen my boy?

893
01:11:35,549 --> 01:11:37,411
Has anybody seen my boy: Hillard?

894
01:11:37,912 --> 01:11:39,260
That'll be the Baldwins.

895
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:40,358
Hillard!

896
01:11:49,228 --> 01:11:51,573
Has anybody seen my Hillard?

897
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:37,457
It's the Baldwins up the hill

898
01:12:38,323 --> 01:12:40,385
Shoot low, boys! Cut them down.

899
01:12:48,301 --> 01:12:51,398
You fellows get on
out of here. I'll hold them back.

900
01:12:59,962 --> 01:13:02,125
Reese! Reese, get up.

901
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:07,967
Sephus, come on.

902
01:13:14,997 --> 01:13:17,707
OK, boys. Let's
spread out. He's here somewhere.

903
01:13:17,806 --> 01:13:20,783
- I've got him. He's over here.
- Hold it boys. It's me. 

904
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:24,149
Hold your fire, boys. It's C.E.

905
01:13:25,149 --> 01:13:26,131
Are you all right?

906
01:13:27,953 --> 01:13:29,596
You'd better get back to camp.

907
01:13:36,556 --> 01:13:38,079
Judas

908
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:40,779
hold his leg.

909
01:13:41,665 --> 01:13:42,609
Hold it.

910
01:13:43,373 --> 01:13:43,988
Hold.

911
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:48,416
Now I'm just going to
pull this back from your leg, boy.

912
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,712
Give me back
that knife, Hillard.

913
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:54,051
Hey. What happened?

914
01:13:55,157 --> 01:13:56,283
We were sold.

915
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:58,881
Those Baldwins
came up from behind.

916
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,694
They knew right
where we were laying out.

917
01:14:00,794 --> 01:14:03,217
They knew when the men
were out of camp today too.

918
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:05,672
How's she feeling, buddy?

919
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:07,185
You made it.

920
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,765
We thought
we'd lost you back there.

921
01:14:09,864 --> 01:14:11,256
Well, I got off a couple of rounds

922
01:14:11,355 --> 01:14:12,689
and buried myself in the leaves.

923
01:14:13,984 --> 01:14:15,790
I saw Reese Hadley go down, though.

924
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:17,221
Did Sephus get back?

925
01:14:18,345 --> 01:14:19,835
I don't think so.

926
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:22,445
You see what happens
when you pick up a gun!

927
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:26,381
All I see is, those niggers
and dagos weren't there tonight

928
01:14:26,482 --> 01:14:29,912
and we were sold
and somebody's going to pay.

929
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,814
Something bad
is happening out there:

930
01:14:37,915 --> 01:14:39,123
those guns.

931
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,871
A hunting party. That's all.

932
01:14:41,015 --> 01:14:42,480
Now, where was I?

933
01:14:43,994 --> 01:14:46,145
"Time to put all shyness"

934
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:49,980
"time to put all shyness aside"

935
01:14:51,836 --> 01:14:53,228
"and admit"

936
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:55,494
"to our heartfelt"

937
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:57,393
"attraction."

938
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:01,022
I'm not sure
how you spell "attraction".

939
01:15:02,608 --> 01:15:03,672
How about

940
01:15:04,684 --> 01:15:05,966
"heartfelt"

941
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,179
"desires"?

942
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:11,220
Are you sure
you want to do this?

943
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:14,935
"heartfelt desires"

944
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:16,840
"dearest"

945
01:15:18,331 --> 01:15:19,528
"Joseph"

946
01:15:23,104 --> 01:15:25,288
Look at that:
just covered with gore.

947
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:27,022
Dogs didn't do all that.

948
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:31,323
Are you drawing breath, son?

949
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,085
The Baldwins!

950
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,637
We were sold.

951
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:37,453
What's your name?

952
01:15:37,764 --> 01:15:38,979
Bosephus

953
01:15:40,855 --> 01:15:42,484
Sephus Purcell.

954
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,786
Kin to Nimrod Purcell? 

955
01:15:46,522 --> 01:15:47,939
That's daddy's uncle.

956
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:51,477
You say,
some Baldwin agents took you?

957
01:15:53,399 --> 01:15:54,698
From behind.

958
01:15:55,658 --> 01:15:58,920
None of those Purcells
ever was too bright.

959
01:16:00,128 --> 01:16:03,177
Grab his ankles, missus,
and mind your dress.

960
01:16:03,278 --> 01:16:05,266
He's bleeding like a stuck pig.

961
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:18,703
I've found him boys. He's here.

962
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,779
It's Reese.

963
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,739
You've got yourself a martyr.

964
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:40,889
I tried to stop this.

965
01:16:43,406 --> 01:16:45,212
See any sign of Sephus?

966
01:16:47,314 --> 01:16:50,344
We'll maybe
smell him before we see him.

967
01:16:56,547 --> 01:16:57,527
Have they found somebody?

968
01:16:57,627 --> 01:17:00,404
Just stay right here, honey.
You don't want to look at that mess.

969
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:03,824
But I've got
something for Mr. Kenehan.

970
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:07,753
I don't think he's in any mood
to be bothered right now.

971
01:17:08,407 --> 01:17:09,555
I'll see he gets it.

972
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:12,939
Who is it?

973
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:18,114
Oh, just some poor miner
whose troubles are finally over.

974
01:17:19,819 --> 01:17:20,591
Don't look, honey.

975
01:17:23,349 --> 01:17:24,931
I talked to Ellix.

976
01:17:25,137 --> 01:17:27,362
He says
your phonograph machine is

977
01:17:27,462 --> 01:17:29,355
going to be fixed
in a couple of days now.

978
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:32,837
It's awfully
nice of you to do, Everett.

979
01:17:34,252 --> 01:17:37,202
Well, we've got to take care of
our favorite lady now, haven't we?

980
01:17:39,244 --> 01:17:41,107
You've been so generous

981
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,739
thinking about me
when that Mr. Kenehan

982
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:46,523
had got you all
so busy with the union.

983
01:17:48,203 --> 01:17:50,895
That Mr. Kenehan is what I've
come to talk to you about, Bridey.

984
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:55,662
I've got a suspicion, he

985
01:17:56,206 --> 01:17:58,417
might not be what he says he is.

986
01:17:59,324 --> 01:18:00,473
What do you mean?

987
01:18:05,817 --> 01:18:06,650
Bridey

988
01:18:07,848 --> 01:18:10,108
did you send Kenehan
some sort of letter?

989
01:18:36,631 --> 01:18:37,683
What do you want?

990
01:18:39,919 --> 01:18:40,680
No.

991
01:18:42,047 --> 01:18:43,073
He wouldn't.

992
01:18:44,065 --> 01:18:46,591
There was a whole
crowd of fellows standing around him.

993
01:18:46,692 --> 01:18:49,880
I saw Kenehan
laughing and waving that letter.

994
01:18:50,969 --> 01:18:51,766
So I

995
01:18:52,153 --> 01:18:53,761
came over to see what was so funny.

996
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:57,181
A lot of fellows?

997
01:19:01,533 --> 01:19:03,831
Do you mind if
I have another drink, honey?

998
01:19:06,527 --> 01:19:08,340
It isn't pretty,
what I've got to say.

999
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,003
He said some things, Bridey,

1000
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,839
"She's been following me around
ever since I got here"

1001
01:19:29,085 --> 01:19:31,877
"trailing after me
like a dog in heat"

1002
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:35,007
"sniffing around my legs
like a brood bitch."

1003
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,858
"She doesn't
wear any drawers", he says

1004
01:19:36,957 --> 01:19:38,801
"so she can
be ready for whatever"

1005
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,738
"stumbles down the pathway."

1006
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:42,355
He didn't

1007
01:19:47,581 --> 01:19:48,801
he didn't

1008
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:54,616
he said you did it
with one of the coloreds.

1009
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:58,025
The lying bastard!

1010
01:19:58,352 --> 01:19:59,064
Bridey

1011
01:20:00,068 --> 01:20:02,172
I think
it might be worse than that.

1012
01:20:03,234 --> 01:20:05,206
I think, he might be a spy

1013
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,841
in with the coal operators.

1014
01:20:08,398 --> 01:20:11,577
Well, he's got the fellows
so turned around with all his talk!

1015
01:20:13,801 --> 01:20:15,893
I need for
you to help me, Bridey

1016
01:20:16,618 --> 01:20:20,015
and sometimes you've got to
tell a little bit of a lie

1017
01:20:20,707 --> 01:20:22,551
just to get the truth across.

1018
01:20:24,585 --> 01:20:26,398
If we fight them with guns

1019
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:27,944
we lose.

1020
01:20:29,868 --> 01:20:31,572
That's the whole damn story.

1021
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,400
I'm not going to
bullshit you fellows

1022
01:20:34,501 --> 01:20:36,020
and tell you
there won't ever come a time

1023
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:38,047
when the people that own this state

1024
01:20:38,148 --> 01:20:40,466
send the word down
to have us all murdered

1025
01:20:40,772 --> 01:20:42,779
but if we don't stand together now

1026
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:44,216
as workers

1027
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,743
we've got no hope at all.

1028
01:21:01,988 --> 01:21:02,773
Help me up.

1029
01:21:04,018 --> 01:21:05,130
Are you going somewhere?

1030
01:21:05,565 --> 01:21:07,488
This is miner's business

1031
01:21:08,212 --> 01:21:09,953
and you aren't any miner.

1032
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:13,180
You two come along.

1033
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,301
So

1034
01:21:28,487 --> 01:21:31,291
last night he came up here and

1035
01:21:32,609 --> 01:21:35,445
he was all drunk and everything
and I said how

1036
01:21:35,546 --> 01:21:37,873
I didn't want to
have anything to do with him

1037
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:41,457
and I would
call some of you fellows

1038
01:21:42,073 --> 01:21:43,549
for help and

1039
01:21:44,286 --> 01:21:46,583
he said that all of you were

1040
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:49,448
taken care of.

1041
01:21:50,984 --> 01:21:52,567
"Taken care of", <i>huh?</i>

1042
01:21:52,979 --> 01:21:56,073
When I saw that
there wasn't any help

1043
01:21:59,518 --> 01:22:01,512
he kind of

1044
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:06,288
forced me

1045
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,778
he forced me

1046
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:11,341
Si... 

1047
01:22:14,605 --> 01:22:15,693
That's OK.

1048
01:22:16,165 --> 01:22:17,942
You'd better
hear this first hand.

1049
01:22:18,908 --> 01:22:20,637
Go ahead, honey,
What happened then?

1050
01:22:24,724 --> 01:22:26,331
And afterwards he

1051
01:22:27,503 --> 01:22:29,317
he threw money on the bed

1052
01:22:29,417 --> 01:22:31,916
like I was some kind of a whore.

1053
01:22:37,936 --> 01:22:39,617
You did just fine, honey.

1054
01:22:42,131 --> 01:22:44,876
Now why don't you
go and sit outside for a minute

1055
01:22:45,033 --> 01:22:47,426
while we figure out
what we're going to do about this.

1056
01:22:59,794 --> 01:23:01,885
So he doesn't
have any sense with women...

1057
01:23:02,429 --> 01:23:03,311
So what?

1058
01:23:03,783 --> 01:23:05,778
You know
how Bridey builds things up!

1059
01:23:07,845 --> 01:23:09,247
Take a look at this

1060
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:12,693
that our friend left
lying on the floor last night.

1061
01:23:21,516 --> 01:23:24,110
"Baldwin Felts Agency."

1062
01:23:29,882 --> 01:23:30,777
What's it say?

1063
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:32,977
It's a death warrant. That's what.

1064
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:36,131
For Mr. Joseph Kenehan.

1065
01:24:20,862 --> 01:24:24,270
So it's,
"Goodbye Mr. Kenehan", tonight.

1066
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:25,340
Miners?

1067
01:24:27,038 --> 01:24:28,368
How'd you manage that?

1068
01:24:29,323 --> 01:24:32,176
That tramp that
goes to meet the passenger train

1069
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:35,413
it seems
she's got the eye for Kenehan.

1070
01:24:35,512 --> 01:24:37,637
So he put it in her head
that Kenehan has been

1071
01:24:37,738 --> 01:24:40,022
bad mouthing her all around town.

1072
01:24:40,203 --> 01:24:43,250
He's got her down there
right now, crying to the miners

1073
01:24:43,757 --> 01:24:47,560
and he's got
these papers from Bluefield.

1074
01:24:54,002 --> 01:24:56,136
I didn't leave my Colt like this.

1075
01:25:08,007 --> 01:25:09,688
You spying little bastard!

1076
01:25:11,477 --> 01:25:12,783
What did you hear?

1077
01:25:12,891 --> 01:25:14,096
- What did you hear?
- Nothing.

1078
01:25:14,197 --> 01:25:16,083
Horseshit! Hit him, Bill.

1079
01:25:21,886 --> 01:25:23,275
See this medal?

1080
01:25:24,921 --> 01:25:28,197
Do you know how
I won this, preacher boy?

1081
01:25:29,573 --> 01:25:33,358
I was sitting alone
in a ditch in France

1082
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:37,480
and this <i>kraut</i>
jumps in right next to me

1083
01:25:38,211 --> 01:25:40,297
and I took my bayonet

1084
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:44,310
and I stuck him right in the face

1085
01:25:45,706 --> 01:25:48,783
and then another jumps in
and I stick him too

1086
01:25:49,304 --> 01:25:51,998
and another and another

1087
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,417
and another... They just kept coming

1088
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:56,967
one at a time, all night long

1089
01:25:58,817 --> 01:26:00,849
and a little bit

1090
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:03,871
I got worried
that they weren't all dead, so

1091
01:26:04,318 --> 01:26:07,436
I stuck them all again
a couple of times, just to make sure

1092
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:11,112
and in the morning

1093
01:26:12,163 --> 01:26:14,666
they said that I was a war hero!

1094
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:22,922
Well, I'm going to stay
close to you tonight, preacher boy

1095
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:27,939
and you let one wrong word fly

1096
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:30,890
and I'm going to
put one in your skull

1097
01:26:31,614 --> 01:26:34,238
and I'll do
the same for your pretty mama.

1098
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,989
You know
I'm not lying, don't you, boy?

1099
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:40,935
Yes, sir.

1100
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:45,203
The man who draws the short straw
gets to do the job

1101
01:26:45,964 --> 01:26:48,805
and word doesn't travel
beyond this room about who it is.

1102
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:52,299
The rest of us
will want a good alibi.

1103
01:26:53,314 --> 01:26:55,212
I figure on
that prayer meeting tonight

1104
01:26:55,864 --> 01:26:57,677
right under the preacher's nose.

1105
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,212
Welcome to the union, son.

1106
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:25,531
What's the story?

1107
01:27:27,404 --> 01:27:30,790
Ludie heard that the Baldwins
were coming after you tonight

1108
01:27:32,108 --> 01:27:33,364
and I'm supposed to

1109
01:27:33,739 --> 01:27:34,681
stick by you.

1110
01:27:37,148 --> 01:27:39,493
You got
the shit detail again, <i>huh?</i>

1111
01:28:04,725 --> 01:28:06,059
Are you all right, Danny?

1112
01:28:06,403 --> 01:28:08,591
have you got your sermon memorized?

1113
01:28:09,269 --> 01:28:11,590
I'll bet he doesn't know
any more scripture than I do.

1114
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:14,634
And that isn't a whole
hell of a lot, is it, Griggsy?

1115
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:16,897
Do you know any?

1116
01:28:17,247 --> 01:28:18,988
I never got any further than

1117
01:28:19,087 --> 01:28:21,104
"In the beginning was the Word..."

1118
01:28:21,442 --> 01:28:24,545
I guess we're
both doomed to the hot place.

1119
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,628
If the Lord relies on little shits
like this one to spread His word

1120
01:28:30,786 --> 01:28:32,721
I don't want any truck with heaven

1121
01:28:32,877 --> 01:28:34,317
and as for hell

1122
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:37,761
well, we've been to West Virginia.

1123
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:43,645
Ah

1124
01:29:50,585 --> 01:29:53,063
What in god's name
are you doing, son?

1125
01:29:53,163 --> 01:29:54,925
I'd just got
your leaks all stopped up

1126
01:29:55,024 --> 01:29:57,403
and here you're trying to
bust them open again.

1127
01:29:57,536 --> 01:29:59,951
I've got to get down there.
They've got to know.

1128
01:30:00,051 --> 01:30:01,376
You aren't going anywhere

1129
01:30:01,475 --> 01:30:02,904
unless it's in a pine box.

1130
01:30:03,003 --> 01:30:04,197
Where's your sense?

1131
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:06,422
I've got to.

1132
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:13,291
I wish
those fellows would get here.

1133
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:15,041
<i>Huh?</i>

1134
01:30:16,987 --> 01:30:18,813
If they're coming
I wish they'd hurry up.

1135
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:21,073
I don't want
any more shooting in the woods.

1136
01:30:28,301 --> 01:30:29,777
Did you ever use one of those?

1137
01:30:34,939 --> 01:30:35,797
The 10th Cavalry

1138
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,689
in Cuba, back in '98:

1139
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,688
San Juan Hill.

1140
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:46,895
Pretty rough down there?

1141
01:30:49,047 --> 01:30:49,966
I did what I had to.

1142
01:30:54,136 --> 01:30:55,864
Is it true, you're a red?

1143
01:30:59,987 --> 01:31:02,525
Yeah. I suppose it is.

1144
01:31:03,698 --> 01:31:05,500
Then how come, you don't carry a gun?

1145
01:31:07,204 --> 01:31:09,912
Well, we carry little round bombs.

1146
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:11,665
Don't you read the papers?

1147
01:31:24,201 --> 01:31:26,184
I want to tell you tonight

1148
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:28,761
about the blackness
in the heart of man.

1149
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,367
I'm going to warn you

1150
01:31:30,466 --> 01:31:32,049
about the many and devious ways

1151
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:34,648
in which Satan
will hide from you the truth

1152
01:31:35,154 --> 01:31:37,233
of who your real friends are.

1153
01:31:38,176 --> 01:31:40,364
I'm going to do it
with a story from the Patriarchs.

1154
01:31:42,297 --> 01:31:43,748
Now, we all know about Joseph

1155
01:31:43,849 --> 01:31:45,683
and how out of
all Jacob's 12 children

1156
01:31:45,783 --> 01:31:47,702
he was the
smartest and the smoothest

1157
01:31:48,172 --> 01:31:49,612
and how
his brothers got so jealous

1158
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:51,841
they pulled off
his coat of many colors and

1159
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:55,360
whooped on him and left him
out to be sold into slavery.

1160
01:31:56,623 --> 01:31:59,627
But Joseph was not your
ordinary fellow, even for biblical times.

1161
01:31:59,727 --> 01:32:01,294
He had a special way with him

1162
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:05,230
a way of looking at
the grand scheme of things.

1163
01:32:05,399 --> 01:32:07,924
So when this fellow,
Potiphar bought him for a slave

1164
01:32:08,024 --> 01:32:11,805
Joseph just smiled and
vowed he was going to be a good one.

1165
01:32:11,906 --> 01:32:13,826
Making the best of
a bad situation

1166
01:32:13,926 --> 01:32:15,398
he put his heart to his work

1167
01:32:15,497 --> 01:32:17,195
and was honest
and friendly in his dealings

1168
01:32:17,296 --> 01:32:19,872
and before you knew it,
he was just about running Potiphar's

1169
01:32:19,971 --> 01:32:23,122
households and fields
and all his businesses for him.

1170
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,183
The only trouble

1171
01:32:26,283 --> 01:32:27,770
was Potiphar's wife.

1172
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,594
Now she was what
you might call, a loose woman.

1173
01:32:30,984 --> 01:32:34,497
When I was in Leavenworth
there was a bunch of Mennonites

1174
01:32:36,141 --> 01:32:38,208
mainly because
they wouldn't fight in the war.

1175
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:39,768
It's against their religion.

1176
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,104
It's also against their religion
to shave their beards or

1177
01:32:46,621 --> 01:32:48,533
wear buttons on their clothes and

1178
01:32:49,416 --> 01:32:52,220
they were being forced to
do both by the prison guards.

1179
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:57,987
So they refused to work

1180
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:03,524
and they went on a strike
right there in Hell's Half Acre.

1181
01:33:04,297 --> 01:33:06,908
They were handcuffed to
the bars of a cell house

1182
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:09,435
8 hours a day, for 2 full weeks.

1183
01:33:13,194 --> 01:33:16,935
They were put
with their arms up, like this

1184
01:33:18,598 --> 01:33:20,640
so that they had to
stand on their toes

1185
01:33:21,403 --> 01:33:23,676
or those cuffs
would cut into their wrists.

1186
01:33:28,605 --> 01:33:31,342
There can't be anybody
who'd stay on their toes eight hours.

1187
01:33:34,555 --> 01:33:36,235
So pretty soon

1188
01:33:37,698 --> 01:33:40,192
their fingers would start to swell up.

1189
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:43,697
They turned blue and then they'd

1190
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:45,194
crack open.

1191
01:33:47,574 --> 01:33:49,618
Blood would run down their arms

1192
01:33:51,382 --> 01:33:52,698
8 hours a day

1193
01:33:52,991 --> 01:33:54,357
day after day

1194
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:57,984
but still they wouldn't work.

1195
01:34:00,578 --> 01:34:02,765
Still they tore
the buttons off their uniforms

1196
01:34:02,866 --> 01:34:05,078
every time they were sewn back on.

1197
01:34:05,297 --> 01:34:06,815
They tore them with their teeth

1198
01:34:07,185 --> 01:34:10,489
because their hands
wouldn't close any more.

1199
01:34:16,857 --> 01:34:19,532
So now I don't
claim a thing for myself

1200
01:34:22,561 --> 01:34:24,586
but those fellows

1201
01:34:25,256 --> 01:34:27,841
haven't ever
lifted a gun in their lives

1202
01:34:30,715 --> 01:34:33,560
and you couldn't
find any braver, in my book.

1203
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,558
I wish
those fellows would get here.

1204
01:34:49,552 --> 01:34:52,631
Also in Potiphar's employ
at this time

1205
01:34:52,732 --> 01:34:55,433
were a couple of
spies from one of his enemies

1206
01:34:57,091 --> 01:34:58,882
fellows that wanted to
bring him down in the world

1207
01:34:58,983 --> 01:35:01,031
and get their hands on
his fields and houses.

1208
01:35:01,131 --> 01:35:03,147
They'd seen
the want and lust in Mrs. Potiphar

1209
01:35:03,247 --> 01:35:04,916
and seen, it would
be good for their purposes

1210
01:35:05,015 --> 01:35:06,832
to get shed of the young Joseph.

1211
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:09,828
So they came to Potiphar's wife.

1212
01:35:30,265 --> 01:35:32,765
She called Joseph in
and she asked him one more time

1213
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,987
"Joseph will you lie with me?"

1214
01:35:34,058 --> 01:35:36,162
and he said, "No madam. I won't."

1215
01:35:36,368 --> 01:35:38,926
And she set up a ruckus and grabbed
hold of the garment he was wearing

1216
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:41,305
and rent it in two
before he could get clear.

1217
01:35:41,538 --> 01:35:43,728
Potiphar runs in with his guards

1218
01:35:43,828 --> 01:35:46,217
and she's bawling her eyes out
and shaking like a leaf.

1219
01:35:46,318 --> 01:35:48,051
"Your servant Joseph", she says

1220
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:50,796
"he come in here and
tried to make me lie with him."

1221
01:35:50,895 --> 01:35:52,359
"Only when I called out, he fled"

1222
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,179
"leaving
this here garment as evidence."

1223
01:35:54,279 --> 01:35:56,136
"And not only that", she says

1224
01:35:56,235 --> 01:35:58,585
"he's been spying and plotting
against you with your enemies."

1225
01:35:58,685 --> 01:36:01,579
"He means to take over here
and have you killed."

1226
01:36:03,686 --> 01:36:06,953
Potiphar had no reason to
misbelieve his wife.

1227
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,844
Joseph was
a slave and a foreigner.

1228
01:36:11,239 --> 01:36:13,277
So he gathered up his servants

1229
01:36:13,454 --> 01:36:17,121
and household workers
and they went and slew Joseph dead

1230
01:36:17,929 --> 01:36:22,977
cut him from gut to gizzard
and left him bleeding in the street.

1231
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:26,051
And lo! They never
learned of Mrs. Potiphar's lies and

1232
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:30,118
went to their maker, unrepentant,
with innocent blood on their hands.

1233
01:36:33,073 --> 01:36:34,837
Draw your own conclusions.

1234
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:12,349
- It's getting awful late.
<i>- shh</i>

1235
01:37:17,845 --> 01:37:18,875
Did you hear something?

1236
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:23,128
No. You?

1237
01:37:23,229 --> 01:37:24,457
Yeah. I think I did

1238
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,439
like somebody moaning.

1239
01:37:28,068 --> 01:37:29,518
Maybe it's the fellows.

1240
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:33,225
I think we should
go out there and have a look.

1241
01:38:51,627 --> 01:38:52,586
Who's that?

1242
01:38:54,706 --> 01:38:57,154
That's Hillard.

1243
01:38:59,904 --> 01:39:01,040
The meeting's been called off.

1244
01:39:03,243 --> 01:39:05,787
Well, we'd better
get back to camp, <i>huh?</i>

1245
01:39:08,934 --> 01:39:09,685
Wait a minute.

1246
01:39:14,871 --> 01:39:16,827
Well, at least
we didn't waste a trip.

1247
01:39:22,135 --> 01:39:25,336
- Shouldn't we do something?   
- No way. It won't spread.

1248
01:39:26,103 --> 01:39:27,279
Is C.E. inside?

1249
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,839
No such luck.

1250
01:39:33,107 --> 01:39:35,118
Find that son of a bitch.

1251
01:40:16,556 --> 01:40:19,619
How come, they waste
more food in one day

1252
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:22,930
than a poor worker's family
has on their table in a week?

1253
01:40:23,492 --> 01:40:24,900
Now let me ask you!

1254
01:40:25,462 --> 01:40:28,663
Who's sweat was it that
went into building those mansions?

1255
01:40:28,841 --> 01:40:32,193
<i>Once they'd seen how
they'd almost done an innocent man</i>

1256
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:34,942
<i>it was like
Joe couldn't say any wrong</i>.

1257
01:40:36,172 --> 01:40:38,540
<i>We moved out
into the Mango County then</i>

1258
01:40:38,759 --> 01:40:40,947
<i>spreading the word about the union</i>

1259
01:40:41,153 --> 01:40:44,368
<i>spreading like wildfire
over to Red Jacket</i>

1260
01:40:44,467 --> 01:40:48,796
<i>to Ragland and Delbarton
all up and down the Tug Fork river</i>

1261
01:40:48,895 --> 01:40:52,123
<i>bringing the union out
to all the folks that needed help</i>

1262
01:40:52,507 --> 01:40:55,036
<i>putting the spirit into them
and trying to shut down</i>

1263
01:40:55,136 --> 01:40:56,859
<i>the whole southwest field</i>

1264
01:40:57,024 --> 01:41:01,345
<i>helping themselves to our land
and our labor for too damn long.</i>

1265
01:41:56,327 --> 01:41:59,706
<i>Joe Kenehan said
how there was a new day coming</i>

1266
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:02,770
<i>and sometimes
I could just about see it</i>

1267
01:42:03,426 --> 01:42:06,145
<i>but it was
a dangerous living for a union man</i>

1268
01:42:06,244 --> 01:42:08,243
<i>and you didn't
dare turn your back</i>.

1269
01:42:11,403 --> 01:42:15,261
<i>It was hard times
and it was hungry times too</i>.

1270
01:42:15,561 --> 01:42:18,881
<i>The union relief was spread thin
and with the hope of a new day</i>

1271
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:20,546
<i>can feed your soul</i>

1272
01:42:20,645 --> 01:42:22,524
<i>but leave your belly rumbling.</i>

1273
01:42:26,833 --> 01:42:27,587
Scoot.

1274
01:43:05,692 --> 01:43:06,561
Lady...

1275
01:43:09,927 --> 01:43:11,773
since there are
just me and Hillard

1276
01:43:11,966 --> 01:43:13,854
and you've got
all these little ones

1277
01:43:15,509 --> 01:43:16,221
well

1278
01:43:19,311 --> 01:43:21,323
do you know what to do with this?

1279
01:43:21,569 --> 01:43:23,252
Hillard brought it in.

1280
01:43:25,469 --> 01:43:26,507
It's for you.

1281
01:43:28,232 --> 01:43:30,640
I'm not going to
watch no babies go hungry.

1282
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:33,586
Now here...
You go on. You take it.

1283
01:43:34,429 --> 01:43:36,426
Here are some navy beans

1284
01:43:37,561 --> 01:43:40,051
and these here are ramps.

1285
01:43:40,152 --> 01:43:42,104
Now, you can cook with these.

1286
01:43:43,239 --> 01:43:45,442
They put a taste in your stew.

1287
01:43:50,832 --> 01:43:51,585
Anyhow

1288
01:44:10,157 --> 01:44:11,626
well, I

1289
01:44:12,583 --> 01:44:15,211
figure, we're all in this together.

1290
01:44:19,711 --> 01:44:21,954
You've sure got some pretty babies!

1291
01:44:26,716 --> 01:44:28,863
- Who's your favorite pitcher?
- Hod Eller.

1292
01:44:29,082 --> 01:44:30,451
He's from Logan county.

1293
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:34,814
Did you get to play ball much?

1294
01:44:35,511 --> 01:44:37,031
When the mines were open.

1295
01:44:43,036 --> 01:44:43,721
Joe...

1296
01:44:45,087 --> 01:44:45,813
Yeah?

1297
01:44:46,332 --> 01:44:48,125
Did you ever kill anybody?

1298
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,909
What brought that up?

1299
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,029
I'll bet Sid has.

1300
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:57,757
He were in the war.

1301
01:45:02,024 --> 01:45:04,756
All I saw was
workers killing workers

1302
01:45:05,784 --> 01:45:07,550
and there wasn't any point in it.

1303
01:45:07,779 --> 01:45:09,797
They thrown you in jail
because you wouldn't go?

1304
01:45:10,752 --> 01:45:14,524
Those 2 years kept me from
killing some poor stiff that got

1305
01:45:14,924 --> 01:45:18,658
pushed out on a battlefield
by rich folks and politicians

1306
01:45:19,796 --> 01:45:21,149
and they were worth it.

1307
01:45:29,225 --> 01:45:30,591
It's getting dark, Danny.

1308
01:45:34,024 --> 01:45:35,426
You'd better go and get that coal.

1309
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:04,475
Do you see there,
right there by the railroad trestle?

1310
01:46:06,265 --> 01:46:09,565
That's where Cap Hatfield
and his boy Joe Glenn killed 3 men.

1311
01:46:10,907 --> 01:46:12,257
Th boy wasn't but 13.

1312
01:46:12,358 --> 01:46:13,773
He used a Winchester.

1313
01:46:17,569 --> 01:46:19,212
Do you think
it hurts much, a bullet?

1314
01:46:21,944 --> 01:46:24,265
It beats dying in a damn coal mine!

1315
01:46:27,686 --> 01:46:30,297
The boy wasn't but
13 years old, Joe Glenn.

1316
01:46:50,328 --> 01:46:51,658
He must be in there.

1317
01:46:52,819 --> 01:46:54,305
He always
sleeps with the lights on.

1318
01:46:54,935 --> 01:46:56,663
We've just
got to be quiet. That's all.

1319
01:47:16,635 --> 01:47:18,327
Let's get
the little bastards.

1320
01:47:21,381 --> 01:47:22,497
Over here...

1321
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:26,729
Grab him. Cut him off.

1322
01:47:33,618 --> 01:47:35,469
Well, well...
What have we got here?

1323
01:47:37,452 --> 01:47:39,011
Smarts a little,
doesn't it boy?

1324
01:47:40,232 --> 01:47:41,525
"Hillard", right?

1325
01:47:42,529 --> 01:47:43,279
Now

1326
01:47:43,665 --> 01:47:48,149
how about, you give us the names of
your ring leaders up in Logan...

1327
01:47:48,512 --> 01:47:52,815
Give us 5 names boy. That's all:
5 names and we'll let you go.

1328
01:47:53,082 --> 01:47:54,448
That's fair isn't it?

1329
01:47:54,641 --> 01:47:55,585
Never!

1330
01:47:56,212 --> 01:47:57,373
Griggsy

1331
01:48:00,721 --> 01:48:02,331
talk to us boy.

1332
01:48:04,567 --> 01:48:05,872
Talk to us.

1333
01:48:06,962 --> 01:48:08,689
I'll rot in hell first.

1334
01:48:09,087 --> 01:48:10,648
Have it your way.

1335
01:48:11,095 --> 01:48:12,799
Mr. Lively

1336
01:48:33,761 --> 01:48:34,752
Boy

1337
01:48:35,368 --> 01:48:39,092
I sentence you to death for
the crime of stealing Company property

1338
01:48:39,395 --> 01:48:41,945
and being a dirty
bolshevist union man.

1339
01:48:42,804 --> 01:48:44,944
You've got 10 seconds to talk.

1340
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:21,863
Talk. 

1341
01:49:27,739 --> 01:49:28,935
What a smell!

1342
01:49:29,407 --> 01:49:31,051
The boy dirtied his diapers.              

1343
01:49:31,462 --> 01:49:32,945
We want names, son. 

1344
01:49:33,846 --> 01:49:36,612
I can't. I swore on a Bible.

1345
01:49:37,929 --> 01:49:40,613
Then we're going to
have to get down to it son.

1346
01:49:41,447 --> 01:49:42,377
Use the razor.

1347
01:49:42,619 --> 01:49:43,635
Hold him boys.

1348
01:49:49,872 --> 01:49:51,395
Just a little nick, boy.

1349
01:49:58,927 --> 01:50:00,837
Get it off your chest, son.

1350
01:50:04,234 --> 01:50:11,149
Plyant Mount, Bill Mahan,
Asa Radnor, J.T. Keadle

1351
01:50:12,854 --> 01:50:13,832
5!

1352
01:50:14,643 --> 01:50:16,130
Give us 5, boy.

1353
01:50:16,456 --> 01:50:17,714
And Harley Shilton.

1354
01:50:18,826 --> 01:50:20,167
- Kill him.
- No.

1355
01:50:42,121 --> 01:50:44,006
So where do
those fellows he named live?

1356
01:50:45,070 --> 01:50:46,025
Clay Hill.

1357
01:50:46,690 --> 01:50:47,706
Where's that?

1358
01:50:48,939 --> 01:50:50,341
It's a cemetery.

1359
01:50:51,984 --> 01:50:54,560
They are all fellows
that were killed in a gas fire

1360
01:50:54,661 --> 01:50:56,204
5, 6 year ago.

1361
01:51:08,523 --> 01:51:10,675
There's nothing like
a young boy dying

1362
01:51:11,654 --> 01:51:13,201
to stir things up!

1363
01:52:02,717 --> 01:52:05,522
Baldwin's coming
into town tomorrow, Kenehan.

1364
01:52:37,836 --> 01:52:40,060
Do you fellows have
any idea what's waiting for us?

1365
01:52:41,462 --> 01:52:42,948
You mean, they didn't tell you?

1366
01:52:43,384 --> 01:52:45,255
No. I just saw
a line in the papers about

1367
01:52:45,355 --> 01:52:48,425
"opportunity
for red-blooded American men"

1368
01:52:48,703 --> 01:52:49,683
"immediate openings"

1369
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:53,104
"high pay,
travel, chance for advancement."

1370
01:52:53,297 --> 01:52:56,344
"Apply Baldwin Felts
and write your own ticket."

1371
01:52:57,056 --> 01:53:00,261
When the natives get restless
someplace they put that out

1372
01:53:01,397 --> 01:53:02,993
and hook some more cannon fodder.

1373
01:53:04,613 --> 01:53:06,872
Ever hear of
the Hatfields and McCoys, son?

1374
01:53:06,973 --> 01:53:08,552
Yeah. Of course, I have.

1375
01:53:08,819 --> 01:53:11,127
This Matewan
is their stomping grounds.

1376
01:53:11,397 --> 01:53:15,081
They'll put a bullet in your brain
as soon as they look at you.

1377
01:53:20,304 --> 01:53:20,944
Sid

1378
01:53:21,247 --> 01:53:22,953
we have authorization
to put these miners

1379
01:53:23,052 --> 01:53:25,139
off Company property here in town.

1380
01:53:25,239 --> 01:53:26,723
Not from me, you don't.

1381
01:53:26,917 --> 01:53:28,982
And we've also got
a warrant for your arrest

1382
01:53:29,082 --> 01:53:30,773
if you give us any trouble.

1383
01:53:36,333 --> 01:53:38,739
This isn't worth shit
and you know it.

1384
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:43,595
One way or another we're
going to carry out these evictions

1385
01:53:43,694 --> 01:53:44,808
tomorrow morning.

1386
01:53:46,632 --> 01:53:47,661
Gentleman

1387
01:54:03,949 --> 01:54:05,552
they came to kill me.

1388
01:54:18,645 --> 01:54:20,506
Hillard was my friend.

1389
01:54:22,899 --> 01:54:24,991
When I first came
down to the mines, it was Hillard

1390
01:54:25,091 --> 01:54:26,489
who'd show me what to do.

1391
01:54:27,493 --> 01:54:31,024
He was a good coal miner,
a good union man

1392
01:54:31,797 --> 01:54:33,828
and he always
took care of his mama.

1393
01:54:37,225 --> 01:54:40,211
I don't know how they
could have done him like they did.

1394
01:54:43,221 --> 01:54:46,086
All he wanted to do
was live decently. That's all.

1395
01:54:48,564 --> 01:54:50,728
Sometimes people say
how God willed it

1396
01:54:50,828 --> 01:54:53,012
how everything is His plan.

1397
01:54:55,794 --> 01:54:56,701
Well

1398
01:54:57,993 --> 01:54:59,552
I don't think He planned on

1399
01:54:59,806 --> 01:55:01,863
Hillard lying here
amongst all these Elkinses.

1400
01:55:01,962 --> 01:55:03,518
Not this young in his life!

1401
01:55:05,573 --> 01:55:07,577
I think
all God plans is, we get born

1402
01:55:07,676 --> 01:55:09,261
and we've got to
take it from there.

1403
01:55:11,171 --> 01:55:12,935
So you rest in peace, Hillard.

1404
01:55:14,616 --> 01:55:17,637
You rest easy because we're
going to take up where you left off.

1405
01:55:22,425 --> 01:55:23,247
Amen.

1406
01:55:31,081 --> 01:55:33,805
Are you going to tell us to
turn the other cheek, still?

1407
01:55:36,425 --> 01:55:38,274
Shooting is what they want now.

1408
01:55:39,822 --> 01:55:41,658
Maybe it's what we want, too.

1409
01:55:45,128 --> 01:55:47,551
You expect
too much of people, Joe.

1410
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:53,324
You're still after that
one big union, but most of us

1411
01:55:54,558 --> 01:55:56,250
we can't see past this hollar.

1412
01:56:50,685 --> 01:56:52,716
I need to talk to the men.

1413
01:56:55,194 --> 01:56:57,323
It wouldn't be decent now.

1414
01:57:01,397 --> 01:57:03,501
I'll call
a meeting in the morning

1415
01:57:05,471 --> 01:57:06,353
first thing.

1416
01:57:54,576 --> 01:57:56,983
Pass the word
to stay out from town tomorrow.

1417
01:57:59,011 --> 01:58:00,197
Is something up?

1418
01:58:03,775 --> 01:58:04,997
I've got a feeling.

1419
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:08,732
You know how white folks are
when they get all excited...

1420
01:59:09,248 --> 01:59:11,594
Nothing's going to
bring Hillard back, you know.

1421
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:16,103
Danny, I came here to help.

1422
01:59:17,723 --> 01:59:18,764
Sure you did.

1423
01:59:20,661 --> 01:59:22,837
First people come here
to help us with some money.

1424
01:59:24,685 --> 01:59:26,704
Next we know we've got no land.

1425
01:59:27,805 --> 01:59:29,425
Then they say
they're going to help us with a job

1426
01:59:29,524 --> 01:59:30,766
and a place to live

1427
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:33,523
and they stick us in
some damn coal camp

1428
01:59:34,309 --> 01:59:36,304
and let us dig out their mines.

1429
01:59:37,814 --> 01:59:42,227
Now you come here
to help us bring in the "new day".

1430
01:59:43,569 --> 01:59:46,265
Well, Hillard isn't
going to see any new day.

1431
01:59:47,801 --> 01:59:50,194
We had about
as much help as we can stand.

1432
01:59:51,498 --> 01:59:53,457
We've got to take care of ourselves.

1433
01:59:56,359 --> 01:59:58,235
We've got to
take care of each other.

1434
02:01:37,797 --> 02:01:39,344
Joe!

1435
02:01:39,768 --> 02:01:41,122
The men go to town.

1436
02:01:53,234 --> 02:01:54,238
See it?

1437
02:01:57,235 --> 02:01:59,448
There's no need
for you to be in on this.

1438
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:02,445
It's my town too.

1439
02:02:03,315 --> 02:02:04,598
They're my people.

1440
02:03:13,299 --> 02:03:15,704
You have no right to
come to this here town

1441
02:03:15,805 --> 02:03:18,372
with all these people and
drawing guns and terrorizing them.

1442
02:03:18,497 --> 02:03:20,734
The writs you have
are not valid for this town.

1443
02:03:20,833 --> 02:03:22,908
- You can't get one
- No.

1444
02:03:23,019 --> 02:03:24,542
No. Wait.

1445
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:10,137
Jesus! Don't shoot me.

1446
02:06:24,967 --> 02:06:26,805
I just wanted to talk.

1447
02:06:30,939 --> 02:06:32,366
I just wanted to talk.

1448
02:06:40,114 --> 02:06:41,989
I can't feel my legs.

1449
02:07:54,957 --> 02:07:56,262
<i>There was a trial</i>

1450
02:07:56,363 --> 02:07:58,702
<i>but there wasn't
anybody going to pass guilty</i>

1451
02:07:58,801 --> 02:08:01,497
<i>on Sid Hatfield in Mingo County.</i>

1452
02:08:01,836 --> 02:08:04,640
<i>Sid got married to
Mayor Testerman's widow</i>

1453
02:08:04,822 --> 02:08:07,525
<i>and then the Baldwins
caught him unarmed</i>

1454
02:08:07,626 --> 02:08:10,661
<i>walking up the steps of
the McDowell county court house.</i>

1455
02:08:10,841 --> 02:08:13,087
<i>They shot 15 bullets into him</i>

1456
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:14,964
<i>right in broad daylight</i>

1457
02:08:15,279 --> 02:08:19,413
<i>and C.E. Lively stepped in
and put one right through his skull.</i>

1458
02:08:19,605 --> 02:08:21,915
<i>There wasn't even
a trial on that one</i>.

1459
02:08:22,665 --> 02:08:25,529
<i>That was the start of
the great Coalfield War and</i>

1460
02:08:25,686 --> 02:08:29,214
<i>us miners took the worst of it,
like Joe said we would.</i>

1461
02:08:29,314 --> 02:08:32,131
<i>"It's just one big union
the whole world over"</i>

1462
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:34,122
<i>Joe Kenehan used to say</i>

1463
02:08:34,221 --> 02:08:36,108
<i>and from the day of
the Matewan massacre</i>

1464
02:08:36,207 --> 02:08:37,800
<i>that's what I preached.</i>

1465
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,734
<i>That was my religion.</i>

1466
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:44,594
<i>We buried
Joe Kenehan with our own.</i>

1467
02:08:45,042 --> 02:08:47,866
<i>My mama thought
he wouldn't ever stay</i>

1468
02:08:48,281 --> 02:08:50,977
<i>but now he's with us for always</i>

1469
02:08:51,545 --> 02:08:54,505
<i>lying up here
in these West Virginia hills.</i>
