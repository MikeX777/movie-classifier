1
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,188
All right.
My shift's not over till 9:00.

2
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,332
So tell Coach C I'm gonna be

3
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:22,982
a few minutes late
picking you up, okay?

4
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,484
Okay.

5
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:25,860
Good luck out there today.

6
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,487
Thanks.

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,780
Hey.

8
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,199
You know, if I could,

9
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:33,660
I would be in those stands
cheering for my baby.

10
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,829
I know. Next game.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,165
Hey, Bron?

12
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,001
You forgetting something?

13
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,508
Love you, Ma.

14
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,010
I love you too, baby.

15
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,055
All right. Go kill it.

16
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:05,733
What's up, Bron?

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,318
What's up, Malik?

18
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:13,575
Check it out. It's for you.

19
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,202
My dad got me the new color one.

20
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,606
Oh, and if it freezes up on you,
just smack it really hard.

21
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,665
- Works every time.
- Thanks, man.

22
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,667
Let's go get this win.

23
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,419
Phew!

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,886
<i>Eh, what's up, Doc?</i>

25
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:35,805
Hey, where Bron at?

26
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,890
LeBron James!

27
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,118
<i>Eh, what's up...</i>

28
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:40,810
- What the hell is this?
- Oh, snap!

29
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:41,978
"Oh, snap" nothing, man.

30
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:44,480
Get your tail on the court right now!
Whatchu doing?

31
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,816
Hey, hey, hey!

32
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,068
Iso! Iso for Bron!

33
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,487
Nobody else shoot the ball.

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,657
All right, Bron, you keep that ball!

35
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:56,743
You shoot the ball.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,679
- Iso! Iso! Iso!
- You know what to do, baby.

37
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,038
Let's go. It's your world.

38
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,671
Damn! Damn!

39
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,173
It's all right, it's all right.

40
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:11,674
Damn!

41
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,843
Come on, line up.
Line up in front of me.

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,845
Line up right here in front of me.

43
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,517
<i>Listen, man.</i>

44
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,871
I'm not even disappointed
about us losing the game tonight

45
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,480
'cause it's not about that.

46
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:28,316
It's about you giving your all,
and you didn't do that tonight.

47
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:29,567
LeBron.

48
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,904
You wasn't focused.

49
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,298
Getting your head in the game

50
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,966
starts before you even put
one foot on the court.

51
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,384
It starts before you even
get to the gym.

52
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,552
But everybody on the team
plays video game...

53
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,577
LeBron.

54
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,461
This ain't about everybody,
this is about you.

55
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,208
Listen, you're the best
basketball player I ever coached.

56
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,627
You could be
a once-in-a-generation talent

57
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,089
if you focus on the game
of basketball and not these

58
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,257
distractions.

59
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,344
You can't be great
without putting in work, right?

60
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:59,138
You got the chance to use basketball
to change everything.

61
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:02,767
For your mom, for you,
for everybody who you care about.

62
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,186
You want that?

63
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,197
<i>LeBron James
has an NBA body.</i>

64
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,158
<i>Six-seven and a half, 240 pounds</i>

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,890
<i>plus he has got the complete package.</i>

66
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,877
<i>With the first pick
in the 2003 NBA draft...</i>

67
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:35,425
<i>the Cleveland Cavaliers
select LeBron James.</i>

68
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,515
<i>There he is
with his mom, Gloria.</i>

69
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,166
<i>And the NBA Most Valuable Player
goes to...</i>

70
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,285
And this fall, I'm gonna take my talents
to South Beach.

71
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,632
<i>LeBron James
with his first field goal</i>

72
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,885
<i>as a member of the Miami Heat.</i>

73
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,696
<i>The Most Valuable Player trophy</i>

74
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:25,224
<i>of the 2012 NBA Finals.</i>

75
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:29,437
<i>The 2013 NBA Championship
resides once again in Miami!</i>

76
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,023
<i>I will not just shut up and dribble.</i>

77
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,100
<i>We in the White House
right now. This is like...</i>

78
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,447
Mom, I made it.

79
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,824
<i>LeBron James
is going back to Cleveland.</i>

80
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:45,828
I'mma do what makes my city happy.

81
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,039
I love you. I'm back!

82
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,961
<i>LeBron James,
makes a great American story.</i>

83
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,423
<i>Cold block by James!
It's over!</i>

84
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,467
<i>Cleveland!</i>

85
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:00,635
This is for you!

86
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:02,386
LeBron James is a Los Angeles Laker.

87
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,971
<i>Here comes LeBron!</i>

88
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,135
<i>My goodness,</i>

89
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,974
<i>that's the stuff
that dreams are made of.</i>

90
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,060
<i>Two seconds to go.</i>

91
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,812
<i>James, the buzzer beater!</i>

92
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:11,979
<i>You bet!</i>

93
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,897
So how much more work
does your video game need?

94
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:37,922
It's been months.

95
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,090
It's almost ready.

96
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,218
Like how you're almost ready to tell Dad
about the E3 Game Camp next weekend?

97
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,303
I'm waiting on the right time.

98
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:46,740
Honestly, I just think you should rip
the Band-Aid off and ask him.

99
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,283
You're just saying that
'cause he says yes

100
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,433
to everything you ask.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,601
That's 'cause I'm nice.

102
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,728
- You're not that nice.
- That's big talk.

103
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,147
See if you can back it up.

104
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:57,567
Come on, let's see what you can do.

105
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,337
All right. Don't get crossed.

106
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,029
Oh! Gotcha!

107
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,241
Yeah, okay.

108
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,618
Come on, bro.

109
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:08,995
Dom.

110
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:10,329
What was that?

111
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,373
An open shot.

112
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,559
And if you're gonna be out here,

113
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,060
it's about giving everything
that you got.

114
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,502
And not whatever that was.

115
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:17,626
Where's your fundamentals?

116
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,171
We having fun.

117
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,923
Everything in between these four lines

118
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,174
is work.

119
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,885
Who said I wasn't working?

120
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,345
This thing right here.

121
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,473
Told you not to bring that out here.

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,851
Come on, Dom.
This isn't a game.

123
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,203
I need you focusing more...

124
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,371
...instead of playing with these toys.

125
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,396
Darius, chill out.

126
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:36,883
You know I got full court vision.

127
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:38,566
How does he do that?

128
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,443
Ball.

129
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,987
Show me that step-back move
I taught you.

130
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:44,780
You got this, son.

131
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:46,884
- In and out. Crossover.
- In and out.

132
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:47,909
Step back.

133
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,663
Come on, Dom.
You gotta concentrate.

134
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,415
Darius, show him the move.

135
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:55,875
Watch me.

136
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,543
Ball.

137
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,088
In and out. Crossover.
Step back. Shoot.

138
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,986
Yep. See, that's 'cause your brother
been putting in that work.

139
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,260
I ball all day.

140
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,387
Ow!

141
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:09,931
Dom. Focus.

142
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,974
You got basketball camp next weekend.

143
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,701
Them boys gonna be coming at your neck.

144
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,144
Seeing what you got.

145
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,610
Oh, we quitting on each other now?

146
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,947
Can't be great without putting in work.

147
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,544
All right. That's my guy.

148
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,837
Let's get some work done.

149
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,298
Enough of these games.

150
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,883
Okay. I'm ready.

151
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:48,970
Boys!

152
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,348
Y'all can't stay out here all day.
It's dinner time.

153
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,766
Oh, man.

154
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:54,850
Really, Bron?

155
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:56,870
What are we having for dinner?

156
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:57,937
Spaghetti and meatball?

157
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,064
Ow!

158
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,244
- Ooh, that's my favorite.
- Damn!

159
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,788
We talked about you
affirming Dom more.

160
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,999
Spending some
un-structured time with him.

161
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,167
We was just outside.

162
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,461
I mean, how much more spontaneous
do you want me to be?

163
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,548
Babe. I am worried
that you are pushing him too hard.

164
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,300
I mean, the kid keep telling me
he want the best coaching

165
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:29,903
so he can be the best player
on the court.

166
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,595
Have you thought about
talking to your son

167
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,264
about something other than basketball?

168
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,515
Like what?

169
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,435
Like how Dom built a video game.

170
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:41,188
He's 12 and he built his own game.

171
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,274
Yeah, I know. I mean, that's great.

172
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,819
I mean, but if I don't push him,
if I don't stay on him,

173
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,071
- all the distractions...
- He doesn't need a coach.

174
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,534
He needs his dad.

175
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,323
<i>LeBron James, a hit.</i>

176
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,759
<i>- James...
- LeBron James...</i>

177
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:52,093
I've searched far and wide
for the perfect partner for this launch,

178
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,845
and I've finally found him.

179
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,138
LeBron James.

180
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,311
Pete, he's a family man,
an entrepreneur,

181
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:07,108
a social media superstar
with millions of fans worldwide.

182
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,694
Algorithmically speaking,
he's more than an athlete.

183
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,322
He's a king.

184
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,907
Hmm?

185
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,785
I know I'm just an algorithm, Pete.

186
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:20,121
That's precisely why I need King James.

187
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,418
I'm stuck inside the Serververse.

188
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,715
No one knows who I am or what I do.

189
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,971
But that all changes today.

190
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:40,349
Because today, Warner Bros. launches

191
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,602
the revolutionary technology
that I masterminded.

192
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,522
Today,

193
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,441
it's my time to shine.

194
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,946
Just look at this guy, Pete.

195
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:58,826
Oh, he is the key element
to this entire operation.

196
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,913
Once I partner with King James

197
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,877
and combine his fame
with my incredible tech

198
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,840
I will finally get the recognition
and respect

199
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,092
that I so richly deserve.

200
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,929
LeBron James, get ready.

201
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,816
Oh, hello.

202
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,486
A new idea from the algorithm.

203
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,780
I'm listening.

204
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:12,066
Hey, son.

205
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,152
What you doing?

206
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,614
Um, just building my game.

207
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,341
Is this the one you've been working on?

208
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,702
Actually, it's basically done, but I...

209
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,204
Here. Just...

210
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:27,957
I still have to figure out
some of the player designs.

211
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,794
Whoa. Who are those guys?

212
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,089
Oh, those are people around
the world tuning in to my livestream.

213
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,424
- It's pretty cool, huh?
- Okay.

214
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,219
And this is how it works.
You do combos and moves,

215
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,680
and the better you do,
the more people tune in.

216
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,446
Let me see
a couple of those combo moves.

217
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,517
Crossover. Foul line!

218
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:47,972
Oh, that was nice.

219
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,854
- Ooh! Posterized!
- Posterized?

220
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,232
Is this not real basketball?

221
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,025
Well, I put a spin to it.

222
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,527
You can get style points.

223
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,969
- Power-ups.
<i>- Count it!</i>

224
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,615
It's like basketball, but better.

225
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:05,244
You just play for fun.
Remember fun, Dad?

226
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,578
Tsk. I am fun.

227
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,038
Man, give me that.

228
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,206
Show you how fun I am.

229
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:10,833
Kick your butt in this game.

230
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,252
Dang, I miss this, man. I ain't...

231
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:14,771
- Whoa.
<i>- Gimme dat!</i>

232
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:15,855
Were you trying to do my move?

233
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,298
Yeah, I put it in the game.

234
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,842
In and out.
Crossover. Step back.

235
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,010
Let it go.

236
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,220
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

237
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,472
No.

238
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:26,724
Why... Why he freeze?

239
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,602
No, no, no.

240
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,563
Man, can you fix it?
'Cause I don't want...

241
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,170
Hey, don't try to blame me for that.

242
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,358
No. No, no. Don't erase my char...

243
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,365
My entire character is gone.

244
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:47,578
It's gonna take me at least
a week to rebuild this.

245
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,166
Listen, son.

246
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,542
Setbacks happen.

247
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,878
Adversity is a part of the process, man.

248
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,522
But if you're passionate
about something,

249
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,106
you gotta learn how to push through it.

250
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,344
You got me?

251
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,032
Hey, I think I've got something
that will cheer you up.

252
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,017
I'm meeting at Warner Bros.
about some high-tech movie thing.

253
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,727
You should come. Cool?

254
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:12,936
Yeah, Dad.

255
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,313
Oh, snap.

256
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,523
Did Dad just come up with a dope idea?

257
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,193
Please don't dab.

258
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,486
Oh, what'd you just say?

259
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,780
Did you just say, "Please, Dad, dab"?

260
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,615
- No, I said...
- Dab.

261
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:27,451
Uncle Malik will be here in 15.
Let's roll.

262
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:33,707
It's called Warner 3000
and it's supposed to be next level!

263
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,376
This could be the new wave!

264
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,878
<i>Hello. I'm AI G. Rhythm.</i>

265
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:42,383
<i>And as you might have guessed,
I am an algorithm here at Warner Bros.</i>

266
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,885
<i>The studio behind all the classics.</i>

267
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,722
<i>But now, it's time
for our greatest creation yet...</i>

268
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,474
<i>Warner 3000.</i>

269
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,243
<i>This will revolutionize</i>

270
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,311
<i>the entire entertainment industry,</i>

271
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,856
<i>and we want you
to be on our team, King James.</i>

272
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,317
<i>Now, we know you're busy,</i>

273
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,861
<i>but we can make it
very easy for you.</i>

274
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,365
<i>Because our brand new
Warner 3000 technology</i>

275
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,033
<i>will scan you right into the movies.</i>

276
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,205
<i>Oh, it's like looking
into a mirror, huh, LeBron?</i>

277
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:17,334
<i>Think about it,</i>
Batman versus LeBron.

278
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,050
LeBron of Thrones.

279
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,475
LeBron and the Chamber of Secrets.

280
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,728
<i>The possibilities are endless.</i>

281
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,065
<i>You'll be the king of Warner Bros.</i>

282
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,943
<i>That's the power of Warner 3000.</i>

283
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,155
<i>Say yes, LeBron, and together,</i>

284
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,950
<i>we'll make mind-blowing
entertainment...</i>

285
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,201
<i>forever.</i>

286
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,124
Huh? Huh?

287
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,090
So, what do you say?

288
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,885
Pretty sweet, right?

289
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,088
I mean, look at him.

290
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,888
Look at that face. He's speechless.

291
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,431
He loves it!

292
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,475
How about that algorithm, huh?

293
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,295
<i>Pretty brilliant.</i>

294
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,645
<i>He came up
with the entire presentation.</i>

295
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,856
<i>I should watch my back</i>.

296
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,025
Yes! Thank you! Finally, huh?

297
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,902
Put some 'spec on my name, right?

298
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,737
Oh, man.

299
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,220
<i>That was, um...</i>

300
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,864
That was something.

301
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,116
Right, Malik?

302
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,120
Listen, guys, I'm a ballplayer.

303
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,164
You know, and athletes acting,

304
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,582
that never goes well.

305
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,044
<i>I'm sorry, guys.
This is all just...</i>

306
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:43,563
<i>It's just not me.</i>

307
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,672
And I can't afford to take
time away from the game.

308
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,882
Whoa, Bron.

309
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,343
<i>- Let's not be too hasty here.
- Malik.</i>

310
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,820
<i>Let's just hear
what they're talking about.</i>

311
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,845
<i>Nah, nah, nah.</i>

312
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,139
<i>With all due respect,
with all due respect,</i>

313
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,517
<i>this idea is just straight-up bad.</i>

314
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,852
<i>That algorithm is busted.</i>

315
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:01,063
Busted?

316
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,270
<i>It's among the worst
ideas I've ever heard.</i>

317
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,900
Top five, easily.

318
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,694
Okay. Thank you. Thank you!

319
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,221
That's exactly what I was think...

320
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,822
You're saying what I'm thinking.

321
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,991
This is trash, this algorithm.

322
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,284
You're cancelled, algorithm!

323
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,079
<i>What a terrible idea.
So stupid.</i>

324
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:18,598
<i>So stupid.
This is what happens when...</i>

325
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,582
Pete, tell me
he did not just say "stupid"!

326
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,875
Uh-oh.

327
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,461
<i>I don't know.
I think the algorithm's pretty cool.</i>

328
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,004
<i>I've got a question.</i>

329
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:30,217
<i>Is it a heuristic algorithm
or some kind of matrix variant?</i>

330
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,263
Dom,
using the medulla oblongata.

331
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,891
I think we got a little
Stevie Jobs on our hands.

332
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,858
Yeah, I'm actually building
my own video game.

333
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,728
Oh, nice, your own video game.

334
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,772
You heard of the E3
Game Design Camp, right?

335
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:44,898
Yeah.

336
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,751
Well, there's gonna be one
next weekend, and I'm going.

337
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,586
There's gonna be a whole bunch
of other coders there.

338
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,696
- Hold... Dom.
- I'm actually looking forward...

339
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,490
No. You can't go to that.
Basketball camp is next weekend.

340
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,411
I'm not going to basketball camp, Dad.

341
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,413
Dom, you don't have to be scared.

342
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,540
You got amazing potential on the court,

343
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,041
and I can help you get there.

344
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,502
That's not what I want, Dad.

345
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,382
Dom.

346
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,135
Wonderful to meet...

347
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,053
Excuse me, guys.

348
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,221
Dom!

349
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,384
Hey, hey, I'mma catch you at the car.
I'mma catch you.

350
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:21,768
What?

351
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,024
So, is this a hard pass or...

352
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,406
Who does this guy think he is? Huh?

353
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,117
Rejecting me? Humiliating me?

354
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,626
Okay.

355
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,378
All right.

356
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,966
I tried being a team player,

357
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,968
but those days are over.

358
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,096
I'm done playing
by everybody else's rules.

359
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,015
It is my game now.

360
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,394
Dom!

361
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,241
I'm your father.
When I say stop, you stop.

362
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,149
Right this way, King James.

363
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,568
<i>Dom,
do not get in that elevator!</i>

364
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,986
Come on, Dom.

365
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,249
You know I can't let you
back out of camp like that.

366
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,251
You made a commitment.

367
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,421
You make me hate basketball.

368
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,508
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

369
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,052
Everything is always what you want.

370
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,388
You never let me do what I wanna do.

371
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,307
You never let me just do me.

372
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,018
"Do me"?

373
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,436
You think I got to "do me"

374
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,855
when I was 12?

375
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,776
Hold up. Wrong floor.

376
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,202
Warner 3000.

377
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,874
<i>Welcome, Dominic James.</i>

378
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,388
Wow, this is cool.

379
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,560
Dom? Stop playing, man.

380
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:27,967
You know your mom don't like it

381
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,063
when I don't have you home
for dinner on time.

382
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,567
All this computer stuff
is your thing, not mine.

383
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:36,695
Dom?

384
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:43,577
Dom!

385
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,542
Dom?

386
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,091
What in <i>The Matrix</i> hell?

387
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,488
Dom! What's going on?

388
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,072
Are you okay?

389
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,407
Yeah, I'm fine.

390
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,117
Wow.

391
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,788
This must be
some kind of immersive tech

392
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,541
like holography with haptic technology,
or something like VR...

393
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,002
Dude, dude, dude.
Just tell me what's going on.

394
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:36,338
Dad, I think we're digitized.

395
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,673
- We're in the computer!
- We're in the computer?

396
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,280
- Dad.
- You know I'm claustrophobic.

397
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,611
- Dad, chill out.
- How do we get out of here?

398
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,695
- Dad. Dad.
- Where's the elevators?

399
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,071
Hey, Siri,
can you let us out of here, please?

400
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,138
Siri?

401
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,699
<i>Who goes there?</i>

402
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:50,644
Who dares disturb
the great and the powerful AI G.?

403
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:55,917
Look at your faces.

404
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,068
You were terrified!

405
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,362
Priceless.

406
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,164
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

407
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,541
The computer's Black.

408
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,750
I can see that.

409
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:14,835
Hello.

410
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,046
Hi.

411
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,551
Wow. King James. I am a big fan.

412
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:23,969
I just...

413
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,015
I don't know,
I thought you'd be taller somehow.

414
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:27,889
Hmm.

415
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,141
- These graphics are unreal.
- Right?

416
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,394
Dom, don't touch
the silver computer man.

417
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:33,894
What's going on?

418
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,106
- And who are you, man?
- Uh...

419
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,029
You're right. Forgive me.
Where are my manners?

420
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,361
I am King AI G. Rhythm.

421
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,928
Oh, you're that guy from the video.

422
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,823
Yes, I am.

423
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,658
And this... Ha-ha.

424
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,952
Oh, gentlemen, this...

425
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,330
This is the Warner Bros. Serververse.

426
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,375
Just make you feel all insignificant,
don't it?

427
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:58,211
Are all computers like this?

428
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,380
Dom?

429
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,507
- Dom?
- Uh-oh.

430
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,509
What'd you do to my son?
Where's Dom?

431
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,802
Who's Dom?

432
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,722
Dude, chill out.

433
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,170
You're gonna get your son back.

434
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,576
There better not be a "but"
at the end of...

435
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,894
But there's something
you're gonna do for me first.

436
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:14,977
Like what?

437
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,940
You know, you, uh...

438
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,192
You really shouldn't have
rejected my ideas back there.

439
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,987
That was a mistake.

440
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,382
Now, I'm afraid you're gonna
have to help me fulfill my destiny.

441
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,242
Listen, man, if you don't
produce my son in five seconds...

442
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,286
Eh-eh! Uh-uh. No, no, no.

443
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,954
All that pointing and aggression.

444
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:35,290
No, no, no.
You're not running things in here.

445
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:37,334
I am the king of this domain.

446
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,877
I'm not your coach.

447
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,504
Now, the only way you're getting
your son back

448
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,090
is if you and I play a little game
called basketball.

449
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,509
You wanna play me
in basketball?

450
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,803
Well, you didn't wanna be in the movies.

451
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,014
You wanted to "focus on your game."

452
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,223
Well, guess what?

453
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,434
Now you can focus on this game.

454
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:57,437
You and me,
we're gonna put on a show, baby.

455
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,814
We are gonna play a game of basketball

456
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:03,526
in front of the largest
captive audience ever.

457
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:04,945
All your followers,

458
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,988
they're all gonna be watching.

459
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,699
And when they see
the two of us together...

460
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:13,578
I will finally step out of the shadows

461
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,288
and into the light.

462
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,207
And the entire world is gonna know

463
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,794
the name of King AI G. Rhythm.

464
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,255
But you know what,
I'm a good sport.

465
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,466
Tell you what, if you win,

466
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,010
you and your son can
skedaddle on out of here.

467
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,637
And what if I lose?

468
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,222
Yeah. Wrinkle.

469
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,891
If you lose... Well, when you lose...

470
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:39,062
you're just gonna have to stay here
in the Serververse with me...

471
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:43,566
forever and ever and ever

472
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,276
and ever.

473
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,362
Oh!

474
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,072
So, you better play like you mean it.

475
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,509
You know, you think this is a game.
I'm calling the authorities on you.

476
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,035
- 'Cause what you got going on here...
- On this phone?

477
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,120
How'd you do that?

478
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,622
LeBron, why are you worried
about the authorities

479
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,669
when you should be out there
looking for a team?

480
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,293
Pete, send this clown to the rejects.

481
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,921
Wait...

482
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,927
I guess he fell for it.

483
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,579
<i>Here's looking at you, kid.</i>

484
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,773
No, no, no, no, no!

485
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,109
What is happening?

486
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,112
<i>I'll get you, my pretty.</i>

487
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,373
No, no, no, no, no, no!

488
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,319
What is this?

489
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,113
I'm shorter than Kevin Hart!

490
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,324
No, no, no!

491
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,581
What the... I'm a cartoon?

492
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,334
Is this where the game is gonna happen?

493
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:32,133
Where is everybody?

494
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,138
Hello?

495
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:39,766
Hello?

496
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,018
Hello?

497
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,063
Hello?

498
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,570
"Rabbit season"?

499
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,824
What the...

500
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:01,496
Ahh! Get away! Leave me alone!

501
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,414
Somebody help!

502
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,917
What's up, Doc?

503
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:09,129
Duck season!

504
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,215
Bugs Bunny?

505
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,299
Whoa!

506
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,513
Bugs! I can't believe...

507
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,056
Bring it in, man.

508
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,058
Listen, I need your help.

509
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,853
Eh, you missed your cue.

510
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,189
Oh. Rabbit season.

511
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,899
All right, here. Now say,

512
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,623
"I'm huntin' wabbits..."

513
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,251
...and try to chase me.

514
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,241
Bugs, wait!

515
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:39,951
Come back!

516
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,167
I should've seen that coming.

517
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,127
Coming through!

518
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,383
Say, have I seen you somewhere?

519
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,929
Hey, you're that famous basketball guy.

520
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,473
Come on, aren't you LeBron James?

521
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,812
Bugs Bunny knows who I am?

522
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:10,356
Of course.

523
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,818
I may live in a hole in the ground,
but we still get TNT.

524
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:14,986
Oh, my God, is that a...

525
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,905
Yep. Cover your ears, Doc.

526
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,870
Why would you do that?

527
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,918
I'm a Tune, Doc.
I can survive anything.

528
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,422
I'm not a Tune!

529
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,840
No, no, no! Ahhh!

530
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,091
Ouch!

531
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,843
Ouch! Ouch!

532
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,012
Ouch!

533
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,769
I do not understand this world.

534
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,689
Eh, my bad, Doc.

535
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:00,740
How long
have you been alone here?

536
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,661
Alone? You're never alone
when you got friends like mine, Doc.

537
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,622
- Ain't that right, Porky?
- Uh...

538
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,832
That's just a pile of pumpkins.

539
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:13,044
Porky, did you hear
what he just called you?

540
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,465
So, what brings you to Tune World, Doc?

541
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,801
Torn meniscus?

542
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:21,970
Midlife crisis?

543
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,056
Ran out of teams to play for?

544
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:34,649
Uh... All I know is a computer
dude kidnapped my son

545
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,693
and I have to play basketball
to get him back.

546
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,529
His name is AI G. Rhythm?

547
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,740
Did you say AI G. Riddim?

548
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:47,370
Yeah, that's the guy. Rhythm, Riddim...

549
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,579
Whatever.

550
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,224
That nefarious nimrod

551
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,792
nixed my nearest and dearest
from Tune World.

552
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,085
He kicked them out?

553
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,087
Well, not exactly.

554
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,839
He buttered them up,

555
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,300
<i>saying they were wasting their time.</i>

556
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,804
<i>That there was much more to see
in the Serververse than old Tune World.</i>

557
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:08,391
<i>Made 'em turn their backs on
who they really were.</i>

558
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,104
<i>They all left, all of them.</i>

559
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,775
And I wish them all the best
in their new endeavors.

560
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,696
Ah, man. Sorry, Bugs. That's terrible.

561
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,031
Family's everything.

562
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:25,742
Yep.

563
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,036
Family.

564
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,663
Well, Bugs Bunny, I need to assemble

565
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,290
an elite team of A-plus ballplayers

566
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,292
to help crush this AI G. guy.

567
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,879
And I need to do it before
that game clock runs down.

568
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,839
Hol... Hold up, Doc.

569
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:43,176
So, you want me,
a talking cartoon bunny,

570
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,803
to play with you, an NBA superstar,

571
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,181
in a high-stakes basketball game?

572
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:50,683
Sounds awfully familiar.

573
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:51,934
Who are you talking to?

574
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,618
But yeah, that actually sums it up well.

575
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:57,607
Mmm. I think I know a way
that can help the both of us.

576
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,861
I declare this land for planet Earth.

577
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,594
Not so fast, furry creature.

578
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,890
Excuse me.

579
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,643
Marvin the Martian?

580
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,311
For real?

581
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:39,315
I claim this planet
in the name of Mars.

582
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,318
My goodness.
My mistake, partner.

583
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,320
I thought this land was in the clear.

584
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:48,366
Well, we'll just get back in our ship
and out of your way.

585
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,451
Oh, it's quite all right.

586
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,453
Everyone makes mistakes.

587
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,830
Come on. Let's boogie.

588
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,808
What? You're stealing his ship.
I didn't agree to this.

589
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,958
My ship!

590
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,043
Blasted rabbit.

591
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,800
Whoa, whoa!

592
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,845
Bugs! Help! Help! Whoa!

593
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,888
Take this, rabbit.

594
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,682
Back at ya.

595
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:14,475
Huh?

596
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,353
You coming, Doc?

597
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,729
Or would you rather hang back

598
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:20,374
with a cranky Martian
and his space mutt?

599
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,399
Just watch out for the...

600
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,668
Just watch out for the...

601
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:23,752
I just said, watch out for...

602
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:24,777
Bugs!

603
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,659
You have made me very angry.

604
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,371
Very angry, indeed.

605
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:40,209
This place is awesome.

606
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:41,878
It really is.

607
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,006
Wait, where's my dad?

608
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,299
Your dad?

609
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,843
Oh! He's out there looking for a team.

610
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,428
- A team?
- Yeah.

611
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,430
He challenged me to a basketball game.

612
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:53,848
I mean, that's weird, right?

613
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,766
He just left?

614
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,060
Kind of his M.O., right?

615
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,521
I mean, he left Cleveland,
he left Miami.

616
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,356
He left Cleveland again.

617
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,358
Look out, Lakers, huh?

618
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,404
Come on, don't look so sad, Prince.

619
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,966
I mean, you don't need your old man
bossing you around anyway.

620
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,991
Look at where you are.

621
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:16,412
This is the greatest view
in the entire Serververse.

622
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:18,080
Your old man is missing out.

623
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,082
It is pretty amazing.

624
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:21,626
Who built this?

625
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,503
Well, someone brilliant.

626
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,297
Visionary. Incredibly good looking.

627
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,381
Modest.

628
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,634
With a multitudinous vocabulary.

629
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:33,638
Hint, you're looking
right at him, kid.

630
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:37,141
But all my extraordinary gifts,
they're nothing compared to yours.

631
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:38,226
Yeah, right.

632
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:39,519
It's true, Dom.

633
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,955
I saw you back there in that boardroom
through some camera-phones,

634
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,315
and a printer, and a fax machine,
and a thermostat.

635
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,859
It's very clear how smart you are.

636
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,988
And Pete tells me
that you hate video games.

637
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:53,324
You create video games.

638
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,511
Why don't you enunciate?

639
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,803
How many times do we
have to go through this?

640
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:57,828
I'm the problem?

641
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,181
Get out of here. Get out of here!

642
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,082
Sorry.

643
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,000
Heard you made your own character, too.

644
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:07,296
Yeah, but he got deleted
because of some stupid glitch.

645
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,507
Ah, don't worry about that.
We can rebuild him.

646
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,551
- You could?
- Absolutely.

647
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,696
Make him greater than he was.
You wouldn't even have to lift a finger.

648
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,723
There's a shortcut for
everything in the Serververse.

649
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,810
What?

650
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,353
Aw.

651
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:25,523
Thinking of your dad again,
huh? How he's always...

652
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,525
"You can't be great
without putting in work."

653
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,570
Yeah. How did you know that?

654
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,154
I know a lot about you, Dom.

655
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,365
Any device with a camera,
I can see you.

656
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:35,533
If it's got a mic,

657
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,326
I can hear you.

658
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,997
Hey, let's get a look
at that game of yours.

659
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:52,133
Captain's log,
Captain James T. Bunny.

660
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,511
Intergalactic space traveler
on a five-year mission.

661
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,687
My crew has been scattered to the far,
far reaches of the Serververse.

662
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:08,065
Marooned on strange,
inhospitable worlds.

663
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,943
I've commandeered
Marvin's ship in an effort

664
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,778
to reassemble the team.

665
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,782
Yo, Bugs. Check it out.

666
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,576
Look what I found.

667
00:35:24,749 --> 00:35:26,375
Oh, that's not good.

668
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:30,630
Were you saying something?

669
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,757
Uh, I was just asking you...

670
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,974
Hey, what's that for, Doc?

671
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,596
Gotta make a list.

672
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,288
We're gonna need the most powerful
Warner Bros. characters for this team.

673
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,689
Now, let's see. Who to get? Hmm.

674
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:49,940
Gotta start with Superman.

675
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,504
Man, I could've used him on the Cavs.

676
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,487
Ooh. King Kong.
He'd be a beast on the boards.

677
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,072
Yeah, listen, Doc...

678
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,158
Try not to get your hopes up too much.

679
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:02,161
You might not be able to get all those
top guys for the team.

680
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,996
This ain't the Miami Heat, you know.

681
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,873
We're gonna need a strong power forward.

682
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:06,957
Iron Giant.

683
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,043
Put him on the same team
as his hero, Superman.

684
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,421
I'm just saying it might be good
to have a backup plan.

685
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,132
Wow.

686
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,259
This Serververse is massive.

687
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,637
So many different worlds to explore.

688
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,515
I wish Dom was here to see this.

689
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,602
So, how come you stayed on Tune World?

690
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,439
Tune World is my home.

691
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,567
It's the only place where I can be me.

692
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,528
- Where I belong.
- Yo!

693
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,363
Is that Harry Potter World?

694
00:36:38,781 --> 00:36:39,865
<i>Awesome!</i>

695
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,535
Hufflepuff? I knew it!

696
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,203
Nerd alert.

697
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,249
Oh, yeah! Metropolis.

698
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,056
I can't wait to see
what I turn into here.

699
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:51,877
Oh, it's gonna be somebody dope.

700
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,637
Robin? I'm freaking Robin?

701
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:05,307
And why are we chasing a runaway train?

702
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,105
We're in DC World, Doc.

703
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,482
And where there's trouble,

704
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:16,360
- there's superheroes.
- Whoa!

705
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:20,906
Hmm?

706
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,412
Gadzooks!

707
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,457
Some despicable villain
tied up the driver.

708
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,250
Yeah, sorry.

709
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,753
Unless someone stops this thing,

710
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,476
it'll crash straight into...

711
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,717
...an orphanage. Of course.

712
00:37:39,884 --> 00:37:42,136
This is not good.

713
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,181
Luckily, Super Duck
is here to save the...

714
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,640
Cut!

715
00:37:46,724 --> 00:37:48,350
What are you doing here, rabbit?

716
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,396
Say, we need a couple of guys
to win a basketball game.

717
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,231
Hold up, you want these guys?

718
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,066
Basketball? Are you kidding me?

719
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:59,487
This stunt here is gonna get me
into the Justice League penthouse!

720
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,571
With free parking.

721
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:03,574
And now, the hero,
Super Duck, who is me,

722
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:07,203
will pull this brake,
and save the day.

723
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,541
That's all, folks.

724
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:18,756
Whoa!

725
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:36,899
The... The children!

726
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:46,492
Huh?

727
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,996
Uh, we did it?

728
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,331
Oh, no, you don't, rabbit.

729
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:53,916
I did this. It was me.

730
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:56,126
I masterminded this entire operation.

731
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,545
It was me!

732
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,089
It was him.
It was definitely the pig.

733
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,382
Yeah, what?

734
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,135
Any of you play any basketball?

735
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,267
You know, on second thought,
I love basketball!

736
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:12,601
Dibs on coach.

737
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:19,066
All right, we're off to a...
decent start.

738
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,235
But now we gotta crew up,
build our elite squad

739
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,528
so I can get my son back.

740
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:25,573
And that's exactly what we'll do.
It's draft day.

741
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:31,745
Beep, beep.

742
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,503
- Witness!
- Witness!

743
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,256
Beep, beep.

744
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:53,350
This guy?

745
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,769
Yeah. He's explosive.

746
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,771
Beep, beep.

747
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:02,067
I know what you need.
You need a player.

748
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,152
- Yeah.
- Beep, beep.

749
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,071
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

750
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,949
He is exactly
like you in every way.

751
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:15,497
Except 1/8th your size.

752
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,876
Sylvester, is that you?

753
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:22,004
Sufferin' succotash!
What are you doing here?

754
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,440
Can we just get some players

755
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,674
who are at least tall enough
to ride a roller coaster?

756
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,971
Sing it, Sam.

757
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,267
Ooh. You got baggage, lady.
I can relate.

758
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:36,810
<i>You must...</i>

759
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,771
What? what?

760
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,397
Oh, come on, man.

761
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:43,817
Well, with the hat on,
he's at least 4'2".

762
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:45,611
4'3", varmint!

763
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:50,491
Bugs, I'm getting the feeling
that I need to be very literal with you.

764
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,919
We're done running tests
on your badger thing.

765
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,718
It turns out
his condition is irreversible.

766
00:40:57,831 --> 00:41:00,292
I'll never erase
what I saw from my brain.

767
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,461
He's your problem now, dum-dums!

768
00:41:05,673 --> 00:41:07,549
Yo, Bugs, does this thing bite?

769
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:14,098
Winter, I say, winter is coming!

770
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,138
You know what we're missing?

771
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,187
Everything.

772
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,272
We're missing everything.

773
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:23,857
Some veteran leadership?

774
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,567
You read my mind.

775
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,907
Police! Hands on your head!

776
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,077
Can't a lady check her Twitter?

777
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,287
<i>Abuela,</i> let's do this.

778
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:39,039
What's happenin', bro?

779
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,419
<i>Arriba! Arri...</i>

780
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:48,215
<i>Mi sombrero!
Epa! Epa-epa!</i>

781
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,427
Neo ain't got nothing on me, bro.

782
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,472
Oo-hi-yah!

783
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:01,812
Oh.

784
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:04,481
Hi-yah! Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-yay!

785
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:06,984
What did I miss?

786
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,652
Hey, Granny.

787
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:09,862
Speedy.

788
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,698
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

789
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,366
Group picture.

790
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,077
So, uh, has anybody seen Tweety?

791
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:24,626
What year is this?

792
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,593
- Man! You got smelly.
- Gross!

793
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,064
- You're kidding, right?
- Oh, Tweety!

794
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,715
This is not the team I asked for.

795
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:31,050
Relax, Doc.

796
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,594
This is the team
you wanna go up against AI G.

797
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:36,597
Best team in the whole wide Serververse.

798
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:39,683
Mother...

799
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,560
Fine.

800
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:44,271
But you gotta get me at least
one real ballplayer, Bugs.

801
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,355
Just one.

802
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,483
Well, I got just the player you need.

803
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,276
A true friend of the court.

804
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,570
<i>Trust me, she ain't busy.</i>

805
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:56,742
Lola! Lola! Lola!

806
00:42:56,909 --> 00:43:00,996
Today will be the most challenging day
of your life, Lola Bunny.

807
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:05,042
You have earned the right
to become one of us.

808
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:09,046
But first,
you must pass these final trials.

809
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:11,256
I'm ready, Princess Diana.

810
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,695
- Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me.
- Down in front!

811
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:16,780
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.

812
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:17,864
Ow! That was my toe!
Watch it!

813
00:43:17,888 --> 00:43:19,515
There she is. Lola!

814
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,895
Lola! Lola!

815
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:29,983
You must complete all the obstacles
before time runs out.

816
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:31,652
Begin!

817
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:33,987
Giddyap!

818
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:38,826
Whoa!

819
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:41,537
Hey, Lola,
we need your help.

820
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:43,705
We gotta play
a basketball game!

821
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:54,465
Ow! Ow!

822
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,902
Listen, I know it's been a while,
but...

823
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:57,261
I'm kind of busy here!

824
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,762
I got this!

825
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,479
Come on, Lola, this is our big chance.

826
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,523
This is LeBron James.

827
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,818
How often do you get to play
with an NBA superstar?

828
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:14,528
Been there, done that!

829
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,824
Huh. That's a good point.

830
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:22,119
But basketball is who you are, Lola.

831
00:44:23,453 --> 00:44:24,454
Uh-oh.

832
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:26,331
I don't play anymore.

833
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:28,417
I spent years training for this.

834
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,085
Do not mess it up for me.

835
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,922
Sorry, Doc. I guess she is busy.

836
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,174
We can't die here!

837
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:36,633
I have to save my son!

838
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:37,718
What?

839
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,511
Calm down, Cleveland.

840
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:41,638
I got this.

841
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:46,059
Lola, we need your help!

842
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:49,730
This lava is gonna be really hot!

843
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,371
I...

844
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:08,790
I failed.

845
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:13,337
A warrior is judged
not only by her skills,

846
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,422
but by her values.

847
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,133
You are now an Amazon.

848
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:20,052
I am?

849
00:45:20,594 --> 00:45:21,595
I am!

850
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,430
Now, go with your friends.

851
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:26,266
Help them win
this battle of the baskets.

852
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:29,978
I will help you deliver justice
to the one they call AI G.,

853
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,397
and save the son of The Bron.

854
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:34,441
- Hey, guys!
- Lola!

855
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,901
Hi, Lola.

856
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:36,985
Good to see you!

857
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:38,737
Yo, Bugs, you coming?

858
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,951
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

859
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,954
Yeah, Bugs! Here we go.

860
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,709
Nah, nah.

861
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:54,995
Oh, I got the ball. Let's go.

862
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:56,213
- No.
- I got you now.

863
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,881
Oh. Ah.

864
00:45:57,965 --> 00:45:59,466
<i>Dunk-tastic!</i>

865
00:45:59,633 --> 00:46:02,010
You dunked on me? Man...

866
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:05,389
I still can't believe you made
this by yourself, Dom.

867
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,474
I mean, people need to see this.

868
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:09,601
You're not just a prince,
you're a wizard.

869
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:10,978
Come here.

870
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:14,189
Wow.

871
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:17,567
That's Diana Taurasi.

872
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:19,236
How'd you build her?

873
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:21,172
- Yo, Dame!
- What's good, bro?

874
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,799
<i>Dad hooked me up
with some of his friends</i>

875
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:24,574
<i>at an NBA charity event.</i>

876
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,661
<i>I thought maybe they could help me
with the character designs for my game.</i>

877
00:46:27,703 --> 00:46:28,703
Game?

878
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,014
Yeah, I'm building a video game.

879
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,039
Okay.

880
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:32,183
You know you're gonna need a shooter,

881
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:33,434
- and I'm that dude, so...
- Wait a minute.

882
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,128
I'm next, because if Klay's in it,
then I'm in it.

883
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:39,047
Hey, if I'm gonna be in this game,
I need a superpower or something.

884
00:46:39,423 --> 00:46:42,884
Between me and you,
I need one of those special modes.

885
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,886
And we can call it "Dame Time."

886
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,948
Nah, time's up. Time's up.

887
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:48,765
You guys can be whatever you want.

888
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:56,273
<i>It was great.</i>

889
00:46:57,024 --> 00:46:58,900
<i>They really helped me out.</i>

890
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,278
<i>Stored all the scans right on my phone.</i>

891
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,572
This phone?

892
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:10,537
So, theoretically, this app of yours

893
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:13,081
can scan people in
from anywhere in the world,

894
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:14,708
using their own phones.

895
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,376
Yeah, I guess.

896
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:18,128
That is sick.

897
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,212
Pete!

898
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:20,756
Check this out.

899
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,602
Make sure he gets it back though,
it's his.

900
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,009
And respect his privacy.

901
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,645
Gotta say, though,

902
00:47:35,729 --> 00:47:38,482
it's really a shame that
your dad doesn't support you.

903
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:41,902
I mean, I get it.

904
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:45,155
He's one of the greatest
of all time at what he does.

905
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:47,657
Well, the jury's still out on that,
I think, but go ahead.

906
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:52,454
And I... build video games.

907
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,331
Mm.

908
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:55,749
I think he doesn't...

909
00:47:58,168 --> 00:47:59,878
He won't let me do me.

910
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:03,423
He won't let me be me.

911
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,592
I'd let you be you.

912
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:09,763
You know what?

913
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,265
I think I know a way we can fix this.

914
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:16,228
<i>We're gonna make your dad stand up
and take notice of you, young prince.</i>

915
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,335
Ball.

916
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:43,713
I need us to focus
so we can beat this AI G. guy,

917
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,006
and I can get my son back.

918
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,134
I'm coach, I'll take it from here.

919
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,803
The dictionary defines basketball

920
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,096
as a game

921
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,056
played between two teams of five.

922
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:54,391
Uh, look here, Cleveland.

923
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:56,560
We got a certain way
of doing things around here.

924
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,204
Let's start with the basics.

925
00:48:58,228 --> 00:48:59,938
Lola, show 'em how we do it.

926
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:01,731
You're despicable.

927
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,943
Simplest shot in the game.

928
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,170
- Sufferin' succotash!
- Oh, wow!

929
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,195
Nice layup.

930
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:08,506
That's fundamental basketball.

931
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,841
Fundamental basketball.

932
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,241
That's what I've been saying.

933
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:12,784
Sam, shoot the ball.

934
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,582
Let's try that again, shall we?

935
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:22,878
Ooh!

936
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:24,921
Come back here, you.

937
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,507
Whoo-hoo!

938
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,260
What the...

939
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:31,720
I say, I say, hi-ho, Silver!

940
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,140
Yee-haw!

941
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:38,727
Ow!

942
00:49:44,566 --> 00:49:46,166
Ball hogs.

943
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:47,819
Hey! I'm open!

944
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,407
Go, Tunes!

945
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:54,493
Here I go.

946
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,915
Taz, no!

947
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,127
Whoa!

948
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:05,545
<i>Ay! Diablo loco!</i>

949
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:08,507
Let me show you how it's done.
Three-point land!

950
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,515
Where'd she get the ramp?

951
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:21,728
In your face!

952
00:50:22,604 --> 00:50:23,939
This isn't real basketball.

953
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,399
You're right. But it's fun!

954
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:28,902
You remember fun, don't you, Doc?

955
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:32,364
Game: blouses! What?

956
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:37,661
You lost LeBron James?

957
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,372
And his son? For real?

958
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:42,791
You better find that dude.
He on my fantasy team.

959
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,417
I didn't lose LeBron,

960
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,261
so stop saying that!

961
00:50:47,379 --> 00:50:48,463
Oh, come on, man.

962
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,966
Listen, his wife keeps calling me
every ten minutes.

963
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:53,426
Now, I gotta get back to her soon
or she gonna kill me, man.

964
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:56,304
Look, does my name badge say,
"LeBron Finder"?

965
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,932
"LeBron Locator"? No, it doesn't.

966
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,017
But isn't it your job
to secure something?

967
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:02,185
With all due respect,

968
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:06,064
I went to school for six months to be
accredited as a security specialist,

969
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,400
specializing in the securial arts.

970
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:09,901
And the sooner you come to terms

971
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:12,904
with the fact that you lost
the world's greatest athlete,

972
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,007
the sooner you'll be able
to move on with your life.

973
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,801
I'm a professional!
An avid professional, man!

974
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:18,052
I ain't lose LeBron,

975
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:19,262
and I ain't ask you about your...

976
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:22,581
Hey, Kamiyah. Yeah, I got
the funniest story to tell you.

977
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,749
Oh, snap!
I gotta call you back.

978
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,102
I'm driving through a canyon right now.

979
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:27,127
He ain't in no canyon.

980
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,479
He in my office,
violating my personal space!

981
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:29,564
I'm driving through a canyon right here!

982
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,923
He need to get back on his business
and find LeBron.

983
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,175
Code ten! Code ten!

984
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:36,636
- You... I can't hear...
- Malik.

985
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:40,181
You have zero seconds to tell me
where my husband and my son are.

986
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:43,852
Okay, young prince,
time to rebuild your character.

987
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:46,271
AI, have you done this before?

988
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:47,598
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

989
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:50,400
I upgrade things all the time.

990
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:51,967
I mean, look at Pete, for instance.

991
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,696
He was hideous, now he's adorable.
Right, Pete?

992
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:57,115
Ugh. Don't...

993
00:51:57,574 --> 00:52:00,035
Don't look at Pete, okay?
Just focus on yourself.

994
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:09,210
That's the character customization menu
from my game.

995
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:11,755
Yes, it is. Now, with this,

996
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:15,050
you can become the player
that your dad always wanted you to be.

997
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,218
Best part is, you get to do it your way.

998
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:18,762
You have control.

999
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,071
75? You're good with 75?

1000
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,448
Come on! We didn't come here
to be three-quarters.

1001
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:40,617
Pete's a 75, he can't even rebound.

1002
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:44,287
Come on, Dom. Let's go.

1003
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:46,414
Dream big, son. Turn up.

1004
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:51,461
Turn up.

1005
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,965
That's it. Now you're living.

1006
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,509
Let's go! Yes!

1007
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,180
Ha-ha! Yes.

1008
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:05,141
Now, you are finally gonna be
who you really are.

1009
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:07,811
Captain of my basketball team.

1010
00:53:11,648 --> 00:53:13,316
Whoa, wait a minute.
Take it. Swish!

1011
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,711
Watch me do it.

1012
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:18,279
Come on, Pete.
Running man on 'em. Whoo!

1013
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:20,483
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Running man on 'em. Huh?

1014
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,992
You said we were rebuilding
my character.

1015
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:25,954
You never said anything
about me actually playing in the game.

1016
00:53:26,121 --> 00:53:28,041
Look, do you want your dad
to respect you or not?

1017
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:30,375
- Yeah, but...
- No, Dom. No buts.

1018
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:34,563
You want your dad to respect you,

1019
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,090
you beat him in a game
of your own creation.

1020
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,968
Dads don't understand reason, Dom.

1021
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:41,428
They understand power.

1022
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,222
You take the power.

1023
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:45,849
You gotta make him respect you.

1024
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:49,477
You make him see that you are special.

1025
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:59,028
Do it. Upgrade me.

1026
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:18,339
Yeah! Feel it!

1027
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:28,266
Yeah!

1028
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,607
Oh!

1029
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,485
Yeah!

1030
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:42,489
Yo! I got handles!

1031
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,157
You got mad handles.

1032
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:46,034
There's no way we're gonna get beat now.

1033
00:54:47,702 --> 00:54:50,163
Hey, how about we show
your teammates some love?

1034
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,372
Have some fun with it.

1035
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:56,169
And remember, Dom,

1036
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:58,254
no rules, okay?

1037
00:54:58,421 --> 00:54:59,547
Forget about fundamentals.

1038
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:04,093
Okay. I think I can make
a few customizations.

1039
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,305
Ooh.

1040
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:11,851
I'm sure you can.

1041
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,923
And now Bron
won't answer my calls

1042
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,031
or texts or anything.

1043
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,366
It's almost like...

1044
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:28,636
It's almost like they were abducted,
all right?

1045
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:29,661
What?

1046
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,388
Now, we gotta rule out
all possibilities here.

1047
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:34,082
Now, I'm talking about aliens, okay?
The government.

1048
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,045
Uh, the New York Knicks.

1049
00:55:36,084 --> 00:55:38,253
Guys, guys. Dad just tweeted.

1050
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,046
- Thank God! About what?
- Okay.

1051
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:41,813
Said he's playing in a game later today.

1052
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:47,336
- Is that Dom?
- Yeah. Some kinda...

1053
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:48,388
Game?

1054
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:50,765
...epic live event
that you can stream on this app.

1055
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:51,850
Weird.

1056
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:53,285
I just had a thought, okay?

1057
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:55,149
Now, if he's tweeting
from his phone right now,

1058
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:56,226
then that means you can...

1059
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:58,064
I can track him on my phone.

1060
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:00,441
That's what I was gonna say.

1061
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,493
Pre-game ritual?

1062
00:56:11,244 --> 00:56:14,831
I like to remind myself
who I'm playing for. My family.

1063
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,667
And right now, it's all about Dom.

1064
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:22,463
We'll get your son back. I promise.

1065
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:34,058
Ooh! My ship! Finally I shall get my...

1066
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:39,731
Wow! Isn't this great?
We're all back together.

1067
00:56:39,898 --> 00:56:41,816
Come on, Tunes. We gotta get to work.

1068
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,276
Move it or lose it, rabbit.

1069
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:46,195
Jeez, can't a guy stop
and smell the roses?

1070
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:49,365
A little help here?

1071
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,242
Uh, well... Oh, I...

1072
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,080
Okay, one more time.

1073
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:59,500
In and out, crossover, step back, shoot.

1074
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:03,087
Ooh, that's some fancy footwork, Doc.
Let me try.

1075
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,721
Okay. Stop!

1076
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:13,306
Can't touch this!

1077
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:15,725
What the... Really?

1078
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:18,144
Look, Bugs,
you already got what you wanted.

1079
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:19,604
Your friends, Tune World.

1080
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:20,980
I still need my son back.

1081
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:23,483
Outside these lines,
be as looney as you want.

1082
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,986
But inside, you do what I say.

1083
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:29,989
Oh, I see.

1084
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:31,908
You're that kind of king.

1085
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:34,661
Look, Bugs,
it's my way or the highway.

1086
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:36,704
Uh... Guys?

1087
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,665
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1088
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:40,500
Fundamentals win championships.

1089
00:57:42,627 --> 00:57:43,670
Uh-oh.

1090
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:46,422
He's here.

1091
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:56,766
Go! Go! Get out of the way!

1092
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,706
I say, shake a leg, Granny!

1093
00:58:03,815 --> 00:58:04,816
Watch out!

1094
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:07,735
I got you, <i>pajarito!</i>

1095
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,869
Huh?

1096
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:26,587
Well, if it isn't
the old-news Looney Tunes.

1097
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:29,465
Looking just as washed up as ever.

1098
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,384
You know what?

1099
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,136
I think it's time for an upgrade.

1100
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:36,681
An upgrade?

1101
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,601
No!

1102
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:43,229
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1103
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,189
Lola!

1104
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,277
What in the world?

1105
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:53,656
I say, I say,

1106
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:56,701
cock-a-doodle-doo... not do that.

1107
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:00,788
I look expensive!

1108
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,044
What's happening?

1109
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:20,224
Oh, no!

1110
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:24,020
Oh, they're alive! Alive!

1111
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:31,069
Oh, yeah. You're looking sharp,
Looney Tunes.

1112
00:59:31,861 --> 00:59:33,112
AI G.,

1113
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,115
this means war.

1114
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:37,551
Whatever, Bugs.

1115
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:38,826
Where's my son?

1116
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:40,553
Oh, now you wanna be Daddy of the Year?

1117
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,465
Just calm down, LeBron.
He'll be here, okay?

1118
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:44,082
We got bigger fish to fry.

1119
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,502
Let's get some butts in these seats!

1120
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:52,799
How big are these butts?

1121
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,568
Yabba Dabba Doo!

1122
01:00:12,735 --> 01:00:13,736
Hey, Boo-Boo!

1123
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:19,909
Hey, yo, he's probably in here.

1124
01:00:20,076 --> 01:00:21,536
Don't be scared. Come on.

1125
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,348
<i>Welcome, James family.</i>

1126
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:25,873
No, Xosha. Wait.

1127
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:30,461
Ladies first.

1128
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,381
- Really?
- No?

1129
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:37,093
All right. I'mma go first
'cause I'm a gentleman.

1130
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:38,177
Uh-huh.

1131
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:40,304
Bron?

1132
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:41,472
Bron?

1133
01:00:42,223 --> 01:00:43,283
It says he's in here.

1134
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,308
Dad?

1135
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:45,393
Dom?

1136
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,477
Bron?

1137
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,903
Where's the other half of the crowd?

1138
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,781
Uh, they should be tuning in
to the livestream right about...

1139
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:00,283
Right about...

1140
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:01,450
Right about...

1141
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:04,412
Buffering! So embarrassing.

1142
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,140
Right about now!

1143
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:10,575
Oh, yeah.

1144
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:13,045
Oh, that's it.

1145
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,106
<i>It's game time!</i>

1146
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:38,487
Yo.

1147
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:39,572
<i>It's game time!</i>

1148
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,533
Hey, look here.

1149
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,993
<i>It's game time!</i>

1150
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:58,049
I say, I say, how in the world
did he get all these spectators here?

1151
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:01,719
I don't know, but the line
for the bathroom's gonna be insane.

1152
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:08,184
And we're back from commercial and...

1153
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:10,144
Where are we?

1154
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:11,437
Lil Rel?

1155
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,314
Man,
what are you doing here?

1156
01:02:13,648 --> 01:02:15,733
Wait, Ernie Johnson? This is crazy!

1157
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,580
Look, I was on my phone, right,
and I was getting on the elevator...

1158
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,614
Wait a minute,
did I fall down the elevator shaft?

1159
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,115
Ernie, are we dead?

1160
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:24,384
Is this what heaven looks like?

1161
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:27,453
No, it looks like we're in some kinda

1162
01:02:27,536 --> 01:02:30,373
computer-generated basketball game.

1163
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:34,899
It looks like Dad's game's starting.

1164
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:36,963
What? Let me see that.

1165
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:38,489
<i>Oh, Bron, Bron.</i>

1166
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:39,632
Who's this guy?

1167
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:42,593
Got some VIPs coming in.

1168
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:44,303
No!

1169
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:45,427
Yeah!

1170
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:48,224
What a twist!

1171
01:02:49,225 --> 01:02:50,535
No, we shouldn't be watching that.

1172
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,812
Where is he?
Where is this coming from?

1173
01:02:52,979 --> 01:02:54,480
Something's not right here.

1174
01:02:58,025 --> 01:02:59,336
<i>It's game time!</i>

1175
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,403
What?

1176
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:08,536
Whoa, what in the world?

1177
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:10,621
Mommy, what just happened?

1178
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:12,206
Oh, my God! Kids!

1179
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:13,374
Bron!

1180
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,672
Babe, what is going on?
Where's Dom?

1181
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,275
I don't know, but I have to go
to play this game

1182
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,693
- to save everyone with...
- Bugs Bunny?

1183
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:25,428
Uh...
What's up, Doc?

1184
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,307
That's kinda normal around here.

1185
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:33,019
Dad, this is Dom's game.
You know how to play, right?

1186
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:35,229
It's basketball. Of course!

1187
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:37,606
Yeah.

1188
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:40,109
<i>Uh, excuse me?
Paging Mr. LeBron James!</i>

1189
01:03:40,276 --> 01:03:41,461
Everything's gonna be all right.

1190
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,362
I promise.

1191
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:46,574
Zap me into you.

1192
01:03:47,158 --> 01:03:49,368
<i>Sorry,
I didn't understand that.</i>

1193
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:52,288
I said, zap me, into you.

1194
01:03:52,455 --> 01:03:55,166
Zap me, human, into you, phone.

1195
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:57,334
Zap me.

1196
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,921
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1197
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:03,341
<i>please give a warm welcome
to your host for the evening,</i>

1198
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:06,469
<i>Mr. AI G. Rhythm!</i>

1199
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,346
Hey, how y'all doing?

1200
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:10,931
Thank you!

1201
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:12,578
Thank you very much!

1202
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,769
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

1203
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:19,857
welcome to the first and final
Serververse Classic!

1204
01:04:25,196 --> 01:04:26,989
Oh! Let me tell you what.

1205
01:04:27,073 --> 01:04:30,618
I know that you all
are LeBron's biggest fans.

1206
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:33,037
And the King has had a great run,
hasn't he?

1207
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:36,082
But that's over. That's done now.

1208
01:04:36,582 --> 01:04:39,668
And it is time for a new king
to take the throne.

1209
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:40,961
This dude is a hater.

1210
01:04:41,128 --> 01:04:42,213
Haters gonna hate.

1211
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:44,298
- He's a bad guy.
- Big time.

1212
01:04:44,507 --> 01:04:46,467
So let's lay down
some basic ground rules.

1213
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:48,844
If King James wins,

1214
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:51,764
you all get to go back
to your regular, boring lives.

1215
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,475
But if my team wins,

1216
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:58,938
you all get to stay with me
in the Serververse...

1217
01:04:59,105 --> 01:05:01,148
forever.

1218
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,441
What?

1219
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:03,776
How 'bout that, huh?

1220
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:05,820
What? That wasn't the deal.

1221
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:07,946
Oh, yeah!
Didn't see that coming, did you?

1222
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:09,824
Well, at least we're good.

1223
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,033
Oh, boy.

1224
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:12,717
Oh, and I almost forgot,
all of the Tunes

1225
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:14,537
will be deleted, so...

1226
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,620
Oh, no!

1227
01:05:15,663 --> 01:05:16,973
- Deleted?
- That is messed up!

1228
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,642
- That dude is bad.
- Why?

1229
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:21,502
You just couldn't keep
your big beak shut.

1230
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,421
Blabbermouth.

1231
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:24,588
I deserved that.

1232
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:28,300
And now, from the beautiful
mind of Dominic James,

1233
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:29,760
introducing...

1234
01:05:30,428 --> 01:05:31,720
the Goon Squad!

1235
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,557
Whoo!

1236
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:37,435
White Mamba!

1237
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,395
What's up?

1238
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:41,772
Wet ball, baby!

1239
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:43,649
Wet Fire!

1240
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,364
Arachnneka!

1241
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,535
Queen of the web. Mwah.

1242
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,126
And The Brow.

1243
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:03,794
Flyest guy on the squad.

1244
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:04,962
Dang!

1245
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:07,423
What'd they do to my boy, AD?

1246
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:09,717
And this next young man
I'm bringing up...

1247
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:12,761
Oh, my goodness.
Y'all gonna love him.

1248
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:14,930
He puts the G in genius.

1249
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:17,183
He's my hero on the ones and zeroes,

1250
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,478
Mr. Dominic James!

1251
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,954
<i>Dom!</i>

1252
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:55,471
Give it up one more time
for Dominic James!

1253
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:56,722
Dom!

1254
01:06:58,557 --> 01:06:59,600
Dom!

1255
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:01,393
I don't think he can hear you.

1256
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,896
I'm his mother.
He better hear me.

1257
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:05,814
Dom!

1258
01:07:06,482 --> 01:07:09,944
- Whoa.
- Right? It's amazing.

1259
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:12,446
All these people came here
to see you, Dom.

1260
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,907
And we used your scanning tech
to make it happen.

1261
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:16,075
Check 'em out.

1262
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,203
This is dope.

1263
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:20,579
- Dom.
- Dad!

1264
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:21,956
Are you okay, son?

1265
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,499
I've never been better.

1266
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,459
Listen to me.
Everyone in here is in danger.

1267
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:27,378
Come on, Dad.

1268
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,338
Why you gotta make everything
so serious?

1269
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:31,006
This is serious. Your boy AI G.,

1270
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:32,633
- he's a bad dude.
- What?

1271
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,593
He's using your game
to trap everyone in here.

1272
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,472
He's not bad. He's just sad
because he works so hard

1273
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,057
and no one pays attention to him.

1274
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:41,475
He's like me, Dad.

1275
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:43,686
No, he's nothing like you.
He's manipulating you.

1276
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:44,770
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1277
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:46,605
Why you using all these charged words?

1278
01:07:46,772 --> 01:07:49,733
Deleted. Manipulate...
kidnapped.

1279
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,980
Come on, LeBron, chill out.

1280
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:52,194
What'd you say, man?

1281
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,214
I'm playing basketball.
I thought you'd be happy.

1282
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:55,739
Thought you'd be happy.

1283
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:56,824
Yeah, you keep it up,

1284
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:58,260
you ain't gonna get that
Father's Day card.

1285
01:07:58,284 --> 01:07:59,427
Those things are not guaranteed.

1286
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:01,453
- Dom.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1287
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:03,581
You going down, King James.

1288
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:05,916
What's good, baby?

1289
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,376
Hey, yo, Brow...

1290
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:10,063
I think it's time for your eyebrows
to break up with each other.

1291
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:11,755
Oh?

1292
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:14,300
They ugly. Let it go.

1293
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,802
What he mean?
What's wrong with 'em?

1294
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:19,179
We'll show him who's boss.

1295
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,098
What did he say, Bron?

1296
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:24,268
He thinks AI G. is his friend.
I don't know what else to do.

1297
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:29,732
You gotta win this game...

1298
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:34,612
and get our son back.

1299
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:37,114
Okay.

1300
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:42,202
<i>It's game time!</i>

1301
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:05,184
Pete's the referee?

1302
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:07,811
Oh, you mad, bro?

1303
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:13,442
Look, I don't want to alarm you
or any of our viewers,

1304
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:16,236
but apparently,
if the Tune Squad doesn't win this game,

1305
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:18,781
we're all gonna be trapped here forever.

1306
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:20,783
Luckily the Tune Squad got

1307
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:22,626
the four-time MVP LeBron James
on their team.

1308
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:23,786
I ain't sweating it.

1309
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:38,884
Oh, we doomed. We're doomed!

1310
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:40,594
You gotta be kidding me.

1311
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:43,031
Did you see that kid fly?

1312
01:09:43,055 --> 01:09:44,056
Uh-huh.

1313
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,433
He's like Superman,
but with a hi-top fade.

1314
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,127
Rel, I gotta tell you,

1315
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:59,279
this Goon Squad is loaded,
top to bottom.

1316
01:10:00,114 --> 01:10:04,618
Bugs Bunny is gonna need a rabbit's foot
against this guy, Wet Fire.

1317
01:10:04,702 --> 01:10:07,329
Oh! Because he's wet, and he's fire.

1318
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:09,248
That's kinda brilliant.

1319
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:11,875
- Whoop. Oh. Whoop. Ha-ha.
- What?

1320
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:15,212
- Gimme that ball!
- Back off, rabbit.

1321
01:10:16,088 --> 01:10:18,006
Entering the Splash Zone!
Ha-ha!

1322
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,313
And you know
what else is brilliant?

1323
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:25,514
This ball movement, man.
Check it out.

1324
01:10:25,681 --> 01:10:26,961
Sufferin' succotash!

1325
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:28,058
Leading!

1326
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:29,351
Whoo!

1327
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:34,857
16? What's up with the score?

1328
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,275
Style points, Dad.

1329
01:10:36,859 --> 01:10:37,860
Style points?

1330
01:10:37,943 --> 01:10:38,986
Style points?

1331
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:40,946
We playing video game rules.

1332
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:43,073
Style points, power-ups.

1333
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,993
See, kids, playing video games
do pay off!

1334
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,079
Come on, baby bunny.

1335
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:51,039
Out of my way, you big worm.

1336
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,461
Thank you.

1337
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:58,505
Help me. Please.

1338
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:59,715
What?

1339
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,092
Come chase this down.

1340
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:05,387
Hey!

1341
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,015
Arachnneka throws down
a monster dunk.

1342
01:11:08,182 --> 01:11:10,058
And she dunks again.
And again and again.

1343
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,619
Eat that, eat that, eat that, eat that.

1344
01:11:11,643 --> 01:11:13,479
And again and again and again!
And again!

1345
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:15,230
And again!

1346
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:18,107
Ow.

1347
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:21,779
Down goes the king!

1348
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:23,030
Is... Is this legal?

1349
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,153
Man, she got six arms.
What else she supposed to do?

1350
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:26,533
Oh, boy.

1351
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,037
Get up, LeBron.
We need you.

1352
01:11:30,329 --> 01:11:31,872
How'd that taste, King?

1353
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,417
Yeah! Can't touch us.

1354
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,211
Listen, Bron-Bron.

1355
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:39,755
This is basketball,
but with a spin to it.

1356
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,757
We gotta think outta the box.

1357
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:43,050
There's only one basketball.

1358
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:45,135
And, Bugs, don't do nothing looney.

1359
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:46,470
Nothing looney?

1360
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:47,638
Let's go!

1361
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:50,307
We're not called
the "Fundamental Tunes."

1362
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:53,811
Don't just stand there, rabbit!
Get the ball to LeBron!

1363
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:56,855
LeBron's so hard
to guard down low

1364
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:58,857
using that huge size advantage.

1365
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:01,151
Sorry, son.
You know I gotta go win this game.

1366
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:02,236
If you say so.

1367
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,865
Ooh,
he just got blocked by Dom.

1368
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,742
The King has been dethroned.

1369
01:12:09,034 --> 01:12:10,244
His own son.

1370
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,530
That is cold-blooded, Ernie.

1371
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,306
Look, this is not like
any kind of basketball

1372
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,331
LeBron has ever seen.

1373
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:16,291
Whoo!

1374
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,502
I've never seen
anything like this.

1375
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:19,670
Where's that pass going?

1376
01:12:19,837 --> 01:12:21,357
- Hey, what up, Bugs?
- Watch the hair.

1377
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:25,217
Thank you. Assist.

1378
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,594
Top floor!

1379
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:35,811
33-pointer?

1380
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,646
- Oh, yes!
- Huh?

1381
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:39,940
Well played.
See, this is why we practice.

1382
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,876
We didn't. We don't practice.

1383
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,002
What's up with that, Pete?

1384
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:46,392
You can't move the basket like that,
man, that's cheating.

1385
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,053
No, you can.
You can move the basket.

1386
01:12:48,115 --> 01:12:49,551
Man, you don't
even know what you're talk...

1387
01:12:49,575 --> 01:12:50,677
A technical?

1388
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:51,928
Oh, you're gonna give me a technical?

1389
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:53,829
Man, I wish you would. Tsk!

1390
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:56,206
I say, what kind of ship
are you running here?

1391
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:57,833
You gotta call the game fair.

1392
01:12:57,916 --> 01:12:59,918
I say, fair!

1393
01:13:02,296 --> 01:13:03,839
Well, that happened.

1394
01:13:03,922 --> 01:13:07,134
Never in my career
did I think I'd say these five words,

1395
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:09,636
"Foghorn Leghorn just got ejected."

1396
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,930
This is not going well.

1397
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:14,641
Your dad's got this. I hope.

1398
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:21,411
Let's go. Stand her up.
D up! Right there.

1399
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:22,983
Come here, bunny.

1400
01:13:23,984 --> 01:13:26,236
- Got you!
- Iverson'd! Ha-ha!

1401
01:13:30,699 --> 01:13:32,499
- Way to go!
- We love LeBron!

1402
01:13:32,868 --> 01:13:34,328
Let's go!

1403
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,497
You act like it's the first time
you ever dunked.

1404
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:45,631
Buckets.

1405
01:13:53,138 --> 01:13:54,139
Buckets.

1406
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:00,479
Who you calling "worm"?

1407
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:02,564
Not you, girl.

1408
01:14:05,484 --> 01:14:07,444
Ooh! I got her, I got her!

1409
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:12,115
Oh, she got me.

1410
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,451
We're gettin' murderized!

1411
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:15,786
Try a power-up, Dad!

1412
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:18,622
What you got, King?
Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that!

1413
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:20,749
- Oh, I got this.
- Wait!

1414
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:23,460
LeBron's on a mission.
He wants to go coast to coast!

1415
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:27,923
And...

1416
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,174
then some.

1417
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,862
Ouch.

1418
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:34,054
Ooh.

1419
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,222
Yikes.

1420
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:39,726
LeBron just hit a force field.

1421
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:41,829
Man,
and speaking from experience,

1422
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:43,021
that's gonna leave a mark.

1423
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:45,888
We gotta stop meeting this way.

1424
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:47,025
Tell me about it.

1425
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,694
Time out.

1426
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:52,280
I'm not a betting duck,

1427
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:54,658
but, uh, my money's on the other team.

1428
01:14:54,825 --> 01:14:56,410
Let's run a triangle offense.

1429
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,096
- We're getting crushed.
- A square offense.

1430
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,579
A trapezoid offense? Any shape!

1431
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:00,789
I know.

1432
01:15:00,956 --> 01:15:02,958
Look at 'em.
Their spirit is broken,

1433
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,793
and that's exactly what we want.

1434
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,582
But I guess it's time to
put 'em out of their misery.

1435
01:15:08,088 --> 01:15:09,482
Go ahead and take a little break,
Dom Dom,

1436
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:11,550
because do you know what time it is?

1437
01:15:11,717 --> 01:15:12,968
What time is it, AI?

1438
01:15:13,135 --> 01:15:15,220
Oh, it's Dame Time.

1439
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:18,765
<i>New character unlocked.</i>

1440
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,101
New character?

1441
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,146
Here's our first
Goon Squad substitution of the night.

1442
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:27,315
<i>Chronos!</i>

1443
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:33,488
It's the King Stomper!

1444
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,200
- Granny, I'm subbing you out.
- What?

1445
01:15:37,284 --> 01:15:39,411
- Road Runner, you're in.
- Beep, beep.

1446
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:46,918
Knock yourself out, kid.

1447
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:50,630
Chronos!
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

1448
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:52,132
Chronos!

1449
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:04,811
Beep, beep.

1450
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:21,369
Beep, beep.

1451
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:27,918
Sheesh!

1452
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:29,336
Dude could use a makeover.

1453
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:30,879
Mm. Oh.

1454
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:32,464
Wow. Whoo!

1455
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:34,174
Hmm. Oh. Okay.

1456
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:35,926
Ha-ha! Word.

1457
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,472
Oh...

1458
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:55,112
Yeah!

1459
01:16:58,073 --> 01:16:59,866
- Dame Time!
- Bye, bye!

1460
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,411
Ooh, I'm feeling salty now.

1461
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,752
Way to Dominate!

1462
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:13,523
That's how you do it, Dom!

1463
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:14,673
Goon Squad, what?

1464
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,175
Yeah, Dom!
Puttin' the lights out!

1465
01:17:17,342 --> 01:17:18,343
Yeah, Dom!

1466
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:20,178
- Hey, Tune lover.
- Wow.

1467
01:17:20,262 --> 01:17:21,614
- You feel good?
- Feel great.

1468
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:24,850
What a job. What a job!
Amazing. He's amazing.

1469
01:17:24,933 --> 01:17:25,934
Goon Squad, what you got?

1470
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:27,337
They can't touch us.

1471
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,771
Goon Squad!

1472
01:17:29,855 --> 01:17:30,856
We got this.

1473
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:31,999
You're the best, Dom.
You're the best!

1474
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:33,084
Come on, give it up! Give it up!

1475
01:17:33,108 --> 01:17:34,628
Thanks for the turnovers.

1476
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:36,987
Goon Squad!

1477
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:40,574
Goon Squad!

1478
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,903
Oh, please don't let us get deleted.
Please don't let us get deleted.

1479
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:02,846
Come on, guys. Don't give up.

1480
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,407
There's a whole other half to play.

1481
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,517
I'm telling you, we can still win this.

1482
01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:11,271
How?
We're getting decimated.

1483
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:15,400
We need a boost. A pick-me-up.

1484
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:17,485
A secret weapon.

1485
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:19,446
We need a miracle.

1486
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:23,325
I don't know
if this counts as a miracle,

1487
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:26,161
but I found Michael Jordan!

1488
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:29,456
He was in the audience.
I know he can help.

1489
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:33,877
His Airness?

1490
01:18:34,044 --> 01:18:35,587
You found him?

1491
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,964
I can feel his power already.

1492
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:40,717
Ooh, I can hear his shoes.

1493
01:18:45,597 --> 01:18:49,643
At guard, 6'6",
from North Carolina...

1494
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:54,064
Number 23...

1495
01:18:54,231 --> 01:18:57,234
Michael Jordan...

1496
01:18:57,317 --> 01:18:58,568
Huh?

1497
01:19:02,614 --> 01:19:04,449
Come on, man.
That's Michael B. Jordan.

1498
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:06,076
The actor.

1499
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:10,497
I was just getting some popcorn,
and then this cat grabbed me.

1500
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:13,041
We couldn't get
Michael A. Jordan,

1501
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:14,876
so we got Michael B. Jordan?

1502
01:19:15,043 --> 01:19:17,045
How could you think he was His Airness?

1503
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:18,546
They look nothing alike.

1504
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,133
It's been 25 years.
I thought he aged gracefully.

1505
01:19:22,717 --> 01:19:24,219
This is awkward, um,

1506
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:26,763
but I believe in you guys, okay?

1507
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:29,557
Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.
You hear me?

1508
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:30,910
Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose!

1509
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,334
- Say it with me...
- Mike.

1510
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:34,688
Yeah, y'all got this.

1511
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,648
I'm... I'm too much.
You're right. I'm sorry.

1512
01:19:36,815 --> 01:19:38,817
I'mma go back to my seat.
You came back three-one.

1513
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:39,961
- Well...
- You killed it.

1514
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:41,236
You can do it again!

1515
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:42,696
Right.

1516
01:19:42,779 --> 01:19:44,739
Well, that was a bust.

1517
01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:46,783
Anyone else got any bright ideas?

1518
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:49,411
Come on! Get it together, guys.

1519
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:52,038
The Tune Squad
doesn't give up at halftime.

1520
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,624
The Tune Squad doesn't give up ever.

1521
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,186
We're down a thousand points.
No team is coming back from this.

1522
01:19:57,210 --> 01:20:00,380
Well, why don't you try
coaching us better, bucko!

1523
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,063
I've been coaching y'all
this whole time!

1524
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,634
Sylvester over here
getting the wrong MJ,

1525
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:07,178
Granny's out here
having a martini at halftime,

1526
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,385
and Taz might as well
be playing for the other team!

1527
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:11,641
Your son plays for the other team.

1528
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,560
Yeah, you're a bad dad.

1529
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:14,686
I'm a bad dad?

1530
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:17,772
I've been trying to save my son
and coach y'all at the same time.

1531
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:19,566
- What y'all doing?
- We've been trying.

1532
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:21,234
Trying to do what?

1533
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:24,154
Trying to be like you.

1534
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,700
And it's not working.

1535
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:37,167
Because you're not me.

1536
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:46,551
"You never let me just... do me."

1537
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:49,846
Huh?

1538
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,391
Okay, I got it. New game plan.

1539
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:56,186
Bugs.

1540
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,361
Time to do what you guys do best.

1541
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,041
You know something?

1542
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:21,086
If we're going out,
we're going out looney.

1543
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:22,921
Let's go, team!

1544
01:21:23,088 --> 01:21:26,216
All tooney, big mooney, full looney!

1545
01:21:26,383 --> 01:21:29,177
Good plan. I say, good plan.

1546
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:34,057
It seems bleak,
but let's remember,

1547
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,975
there's an entire half left to play.

1548
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,695
Oh, that first half
was interminable.

1549
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:50,573
Are you kidding me?

1550
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:00,250
It's showtime!

1551
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:05,839
Yeah! Let's go, Tunes!

1552
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,966
Yep, we in here. Are we ready?

1553
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:11,219
Tune Squad, we in the building!

1554
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,138
Ha-ha. Yes, sir!

1555
01:22:13,221 --> 01:22:15,061
Tune Squad!

1556
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,731
Hey, they may be down
a gazillion points,

1557
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,609
but LeBron James and the Tunes
are coming back out here

1558
01:22:26,776 --> 01:22:28,736
for the third quarter
with some renewed energy.

1559
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:31,865
And I don't understand why.
They are losing really badly.

1560
01:22:32,907 --> 01:22:34,719
All right, here we go
in the third quarter.

1561
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:37,787
Uh-oh.

1562
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:40,582
Yeah! Bird versus baby bird.

1563
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:42,625
Do you have your ticket?

1564
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:46,254
'Cause the 11:50 Express
is running on time.

1565
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:47,755
Huh?

1566
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:54,596
Classic.

1567
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:57,744
Give me that ball, rabbit.

1568
01:22:58,391 --> 01:22:59,642
Whoa!

1569
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:04,272
Someone's absorbed
in the game.

1570
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:08,990
Beep, beep.

1571
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:10,403
- Yo.
- Hey, guys.

1572
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:11,696
Where's the ball?

1573
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:13,942
Beep, beep.

1574
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:22,812
Beep, beep.

1575
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,793
Oh, no! Are you kidding me?

1576
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:27,420
Road Runner smokescreen?

1577
01:23:27,504 --> 01:23:29,172
It's the oldest trick in the book!

1578
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,381
Tweety!

1579
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:33,384
Ooh, slam dunk!

1580
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:35,471
Just like I drew it up.

1581
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:38,181
Gossamer, I say,
he's the quicker-picker-upper.

1582
01:23:41,059 --> 01:23:43,811
Oh, what a no-look pass
ahead to Dom.

1583
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,939
Looks like the Goons
are playing keep-away.

1584
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:48,506
<i>Dom passes to Wet Fire.</i>

1585
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:51,236
<i>Wet Fire back to Brow.
He's gonna dunk... Oh!</i>

1586
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:52,879
<i>But he freezes at the rim!</i>

1587
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:54,864
<i>Oh? Huh?</i>

1588
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:58,076
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1589
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,078
<i>Giving new meaning to
"suspended from the game"!</i>

1590
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:01,329
Give me that.

1591
01:24:01,871 --> 01:24:04,374
<i>But the Goons fast break,
take it to the other end.</i>

1592
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:06,876
<i>These silly Tunes don't have
what it takes to win.</i>

1593
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:10,430
<i>No, wait, wait.
I wasn't trying to start a...</i>

1594
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:13,216
Oh, we rappin' now?
We rappin'?

1595
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:18,513
Hey, Porky, fry 'em.

1596
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,057
Fry 'em? Me... Me... Me?

1597
01:24:21,224 --> 01:24:25,311
Show 'em who you really are,
Notorious P.I.G.

1598
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:33,236
Oh... Oh, boy. Here goes nothin'.

1599
01:24:37,532 --> 01:24:38,866
<i>What up? It's Porky Pig</i>

1600
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,243
<i>They call me P Double</i>

1601
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:42,954
<i>AI G. step to me
He don't want no trouble</i>

1602
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,037
- Yeah!
- Boo!

1603
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:45,790
<i>I was famous before the internets</i>

1604
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,167
<i>Since 1935
I've been getting respect</i>

1605
01:24:48,626 --> 01:24:50,753
<i>This pig is lit
I'm super legit</i>

1606
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,590
<i>Every time I'm out in public
People askin' me for pics</i>

1607
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:56,050
<i>You, nobody knows you
When you walk the street</i>

1608
01:24:56,134 --> 01:24:58,886
<i>How your last name Rhythm
And you still off-beat</i>

1609
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,406
- Off-beat!
<i>- From beginning to the end</i>

1610
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,639
<i>I'm here for all the smoke</i>

1611
01:25:01,723 --> 01:25:04,183
<i>Your squad ain't all-star
Your squad is all jokes</i>

1612
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,267
All jokes!

1613
01:25:05,268 --> 01:25:07,038
<i>End this with one bar
Most famous of all quotes</i>

1614
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:08,229
<i>This battle is now over</i>

1615
01:25:08,313 --> 01:25:10,023
<i>That... That... That's all folks</i>

1616
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,359
Yeah, Porky!

1617
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:15,236
That's all, folks!

1618
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,946
Get off the stage!

1619
01:25:24,121 --> 01:25:25,413
Style points.

1620
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:30,835
I'm not exactly sure
what we just witnessed here.

1621
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:33,463
He just got
bonus points for those bars.

1622
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:34,964
He was spittin' hot fire.

1623
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:35,964
Yeah!

1624
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:40,011
Taz brings it up.
He can really pat the rock.

1625
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:42,055
And it's stolen by The Brow!

1626
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:44,015
Back to Tasmania, ya little devil.

1627
01:25:44,098 --> 01:25:46,893
Taz!

1628
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:55,567
Huh?

1629
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:57,403
- Yeah!
- Let's go! Yeah!

1630
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:00,865
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

1631
01:26:00,948 --> 01:26:02,533
Make a call, Pete!

1632
01:26:02,617 --> 01:26:04,035
Oh, you wanna swallow your whistle?

1633
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:07,997
Yeah! How'd that taste?

1634
01:26:08,081 --> 01:26:09,224
Now call the game!

1635
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:12,877
How did I lose control?

1636
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:14,962
I didn't lose control.

1637
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:17,507
You lost... You...

1638
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:20,134
This one lost... I haven't lost any...

1639
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:22,428
Yeah, baby, let's go. Let's go!

1640
01:26:22,512 --> 01:26:23,739
- Yes!
- Yay, LeBron!

1641
01:26:23,763 --> 01:26:24,806
- Let's go!
- Yes!

1642
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:26,529
- Let's go, Tunes!
- Here we go! Let's go!

1643
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:27,600
Let's go, Tunes!

1644
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:31,062
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!

1645
01:26:31,354 --> 01:26:34,440
Let's go, Tunes! Let's go, Tunes!

1646
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:35,983
Let's go, Tunes!

1647
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:38,528
Let's go, Tunes! Let's go, Tunes!

1648
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:41,280
Wow! Check out this crowd.

1649
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:44,325
Everyone really getting behind
the Tune Squad.

1650
01:26:44,492 --> 01:26:46,160
You know somethin', it's about time.

1651
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:56,188
Coming off
the bench now for the Tunes,

1652
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:57,964
Wile E. Coyote.

1653
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:04,887
Beep, beep.

1654
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:22,655
Wow.

1655
01:27:25,742 --> 01:27:26,784
Look out.

1656
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:29,996
Looks like Wile E.'s gotten himself
mixed up in the machine.

1657
01:27:45,178 --> 01:27:46,512
And just like that,

1658
01:27:46,596 --> 01:27:48,973
the Tunes have a thousand points
on the board.

1659
01:27:49,056 --> 01:27:50,475
We havin' fun yet?

1660
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,663
They're gonna clean
these coyotes off the court

1661
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,123
and keep the game going.

1662
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:58,065
What's wrong, AI?
That was awesome.

1663
01:27:58,149 --> 01:28:00,269
What do you mean, "What's wrong?"
They're catching up.

1664
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,445
Run Dame Time.

1665
01:28:06,574 --> 01:28:07,575
Not him again.

1666
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:09,952
He's gonna
make bacon out of us.

1667
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:13,539
Oh, don't worry. Time's on our side.

1668
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:21,756
She knows time is literally
on their side, right?

1669
01:28:25,343 --> 01:28:26,511
You sure about this, Granny?

1670
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:29,430
I'm going old-school on his butt.

1671
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:36,687
Whoa.

1672
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:45,904
Come on.

1673
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:49,950
Stop!

1674
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:57,416
Tick-tock.

1675
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:02,421
Hyah!

1676
01:29:05,258 --> 01:29:07,635
She is The One.

1677
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:13,015
What in the AARP
is going on out here?

1678
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:17,395
I got hops! Whoo!

1679
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:19,938
Lola!

1680
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:21,607
Got you, Bron!

1681
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:47,466
There we go! Let's go!

1682
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:49,260
And the Tunes take the lead!

1683
01:29:49,677 --> 01:29:52,805
What a play from Lola and LeBron James!

1684
01:29:52,889 --> 01:29:54,640
A monster jam!

1685
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:56,934
LeBron came back from three-one down.

1686
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:59,520
Can he come back from this far back?

1687
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:02,189
Let me tell you this, I woke up today
and only knew one world.

1688
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:04,942
Then I got sucked into my phone,
and at this point,

1689
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:06,861
anything's possible!

1690
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:10,730
- Way to go, Tunes!
- Let's go!

1691
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:11,782
Foghorn, right here.

1692
01:30:11,866 --> 01:30:13,719
- Yeah! I say, that's all right!
- Yeah!

1693
01:30:13,743 --> 01:30:15,369
- Lola!
- Yes! My dude!

1694
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:16,454
Taz!

1695
01:30:18,456 --> 01:30:20,791
- Go, baby! Yeah!
- Oh, yeah! Here we go!

1696
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:21,977
Way to go, Tune Squad!

1697
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:23,520
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1698
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:25,796
Now we having some fun! Yeah!

1699
01:30:26,589 --> 01:30:29,008
Whoo-hoo!
This is fun basketball right here!

1700
01:30:29,216 --> 01:30:31,256
- Be yourselves! Be yourselves!
- All right!

1701
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:34,013
Hey, Dom, are you a Tune
or are you a Goon?

1702
01:30:34,138 --> 01:30:35,222
Tune or Goon? Tune or Goon?

1703
01:30:35,306 --> 01:30:36,974
Make up your mind. Make up your mind.

1704
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:38,976
Let's go. Sit down.

1705
01:30:39,143 --> 01:30:41,103
Yeah. Way to get looney out there.

1706
01:30:41,187 --> 01:30:43,022
Ooh-whee!

1707
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:44,857
We did it!

1708
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:49,570
Everybody happy, huh?

1709
01:30:49,737 --> 01:30:51,447
Everybody having a good time? Yeah?

1710
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:52,841
You having a lot of fun out there?

1711
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:55,218
'Cause that's all that matters, right?
Is that you're having fun.

1712
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:56,470
That doesn't matter at all!

1713
01:30:56,494 --> 01:30:59,538
What matters is that
I win this game!

1714
01:31:00,706 --> 01:31:04,335
Oh, and you, Dom.
How are you losing at your own game?

1715
01:31:04,418 --> 01:31:07,314
For server's sake,
I didn't even think that was possible!

1716
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:09,298
I expected a lot more out of you, son.

1717
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:12,134
Get your head in the game.
I need to win!

1718
01:31:12,343 --> 01:31:13,344
All right!

1719
01:31:13,427 --> 01:31:15,262
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw!

1720
01:31:15,346 --> 01:31:16,430
Drinks on me!

1721
01:31:16,514 --> 01:31:18,140
Boy, that was awesome!

1722
01:31:18,224 --> 01:31:19,266
Go team!

1723
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:23,187
Yeah,
maybe your dad was right about you.

1724
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:26,399
Letting you be you was a mistake.

1725
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:32,780
Okay.

1726
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:36,117
If everybody would move down,
then we could all sit on the bench.

1727
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:37,910
Let's all sit on the bench!

1728
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:40,871
Now that's what
I call momentum, son.

1729
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:42,265
- LeBron?
- Way to go!

1730
01:31:42,289 --> 01:31:43,541
Hey, you with us?

1731
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:45,042
I'm so tickled.

1732
01:31:47,211 --> 01:31:48,921
Let's end this.

1733
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:51,132
I'm getting my son back.

1734
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:08,650
Iso. Clear out.

1735
01:32:17,033 --> 01:32:18,492
I wonder what move he's gonna do.

1736
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:19,660
The post-up?

1737
01:32:19,744 --> 01:32:20,745
Maybe the fadeaway.

1738
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,538
He's gonna dunk all over him.

1739
01:32:23,164 --> 01:32:25,332
Look at that kid! Kid's too small.

1740
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:33,758
Dad, what are you doing?

1741
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:35,124
We're in the middle of a game.

1742
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:37,887
Hey, what's goin' on?

1743
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:39,221
I don't know.

1744
01:32:41,057 --> 01:32:42,266
Dad...

1745
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:48,606
Dom, your game is amazing, son.

1746
01:32:49,857 --> 01:32:52,297
But I guess I would've known that
if I would've listened more.

1747
01:32:52,443 --> 01:32:53,903
Sorry I didn't.

1748
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:55,821
For me, when I was a kid,

1749
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:58,902
the things that I went through
to get where I am now,

1750
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:01,827
I had to be a certain way.

1751
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:04,538
Yeah, it helped me win games,

1752
01:33:05,873 --> 01:33:07,917
but not so much being a dad.

1753
01:33:10,878 --> 01:33:14,006
I'm still learning how.
You're teaching me.

1754
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:16,926
I want you to be yourself.

1755
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:21,764
Do you understand how much I love you?

1756
01:33:23,599 --> 01:33:26,227
Do you understand
how important you are to me?

1757
01:33:28,354 --> 01:33:29,855
How very special you are?

1758
01:33:31,607 --> 01:33:34,777
I mean, I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.

1759
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:44,411
Sounds right to me.

1760
01:33:51,544 --> 01:33:52,920
I love you, Dad.

1761
01:33:54,088 --> 01:33:55,631
I love you too, son.

1762
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:06,600
- Oh, now, that's beautiful.
- Let's go!

1763
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:07,893
Whoo!

1764
01:34:07,977 --> 01:34:09,270
I think I'm gonna cry.

1765
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,188
Not me.

1766
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:15,317
Bugs, pull it together.

1767
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:16,902
Dom!

1768
01:34:18,529 --> 01:34:19,530
Dom!

1769
01:34:22,783 --> 01:34:23,784
Mom!

1770
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:25,452
Hey, Xosha!

1771
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:27,454
Are you serious?

1772
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:31,250
Zip it!

1773
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:34,837
You two are a joke, you know that?

1774
01:34:36,172 --> 01:34:37,339
I got this, Dad.

1775
01:34:37,715 --> 01:34:39,317
Oh, what?
You got something to say?

1776
01:34:39,341 --> 01:34:42,845
Yeah. I think you want people
to fear you more than anything.

1777
01:34:43,012 --> 01:34:44,805
And I'm not about that, AI G.

1778
01:34:45,431 --> 01:34:46,765
I'm playing with my dad.

1779
01:34:46,849 --> 01:34:49,602
First of all, it's Mr. Rhythm to you,
you little traitor.

1780
01:34:49,685 --> 01:34:52,605
Second of all, you're not.
You're playing against your dad.

1781
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:54,356
See what this says? "Goon Squad."

1782
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,108
You already made your choice, Dom.

1783
01:34:56,192 --> 01:34:57,526
Right, Pete? He can't...

1784
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:59,570
Pete, are you crying?

1785
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:02,364
There's no crying
in the Serververse, Pete!

1786
01:35:04,325 --> 01:35:06,076
All right. Yeah, all right.

1787
01:35:06,327 --> 01:35:07,828
I see how it is, Dom.

1788
01:35:07,912 --> 01:35:09,663
I see how it is.

1789
01:35:09,747 --> 01:35:11,081
I gave you everything!

1790
01:35:11,707 --> 01:35:13,667
I say, I say, good to have you, son.

1791
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:15,729
- Great spot for you right here, kid.
- We got 'em now!

1792
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:17,129
<i>Bienvenido, señorito!</i>

1793
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:18,982
- Somebody get him a new jersey.
- Welcome to the hunt.

1794
01:35:19,006 --> 01:35:20,216
Sufferin' succotash!

1795
01:35:20,299 --> 01:35:22,301
I made this, just in case.

1796
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:23,385
Thanks, Granny.

1797
01:35:23,469 --> 01:35:24,762
Eh. What's up, Dom?

1798
01:35:24,845 --> 01:35:26,138
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

1799
01:35:26,222 --> 01:35:27,138
Here you go, Dom.

1800
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:28,899
Really glad
to have you on the team!

1801
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:30,266
Thanks, Dad.

1802
01:35:30,267 --> 01:35:31,311
Fine.

1803
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:35,105
You wanna join these losers?

1804
01:35:35,648 --> 01:35:37,066
You go ahead, Dom.

1805
01:35:37,650 --> 01:35:39,735
'Cause it's not your game anymore.

1806
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:41,969
I am the game.

1807
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:45,699
King Kong ain't got nothin' on me!

1808
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:03,300
- Did you see that?
- Uh-huh.

1809
01:36:03,425 --> 01:36:05,219
The man just grew, like, five feet.

1810
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:11,201
Yo, King.

1811
01:36:11,225 --> 01:36:13,936
You're about to lose
your family, your friends,

1812
01:36:14,103 --> 01:36:15,396
those Tunes,

1813
01:36:15,604 --> 01:36:17,398
everything you love.

1814
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:19,566
I don't think so.

1815
01:36:19,984 --> 01:36:21,902
Oh, it's on.

1816
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:30,786
Count it!

1817
01:36:34,665 --> 01:36:35,623
Yeah, Lola!

1818
01:36:35,624 --> 01:36:37,002
All right!

1819
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:38,210
Nice pass, King!

1820
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:41,338
Let's go, Tunes!
Let's go, Tunes!

1821
01:36:41,422 --> 01:36:42,673
Let's go, Tunes!

1822
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:45,801
That's cute. But I thought I told you...

1823
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,182
What?

1824
01:36:52,725 --> 01:36:53,726
Ugh!

1825
01:36:54,018 --> 01:36:55,728
...it's my game now.

1826
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:57,771
Yo, yo, switching everything.

1827
01:36:57,855 --> 01:36:58,856
Yo', stay home. Bump out.

1828
01:37:01,692 --> 01:37:02,860
Sic 'em, Goons.

1829
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,027
Get back, rabbit.

1830
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:11,409
Ow!

1831
01:37:11,827 --> 01:37:12,907
Come here!

1832
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,100
Incoming!

1833
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:41,482
Whoo!

1834
01:37:42,191 --> 01:37:43,233
I'm a monster!

1835
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,070
We about to break the internet, baby!

1836
01:37:48,113 --> 01:37:49,114
It's over.

1837
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:51,200
Time out.

1838
01:37:51,617 --> 01:37:53,160
Oh, brother.

1839
01:37:54,661 --> 01:37:55,663
Did you see that?

1840
01:37:56,205 --> 01:37:57,205
He's cheating!

1841
01:37:57,206 --> 01:38:00,000
Well, I say, I say,
that plain ol' sucks.

1842
01:38:00,084 --> 01:38:02,504
Listen, it's all right.
All we gotta do is get one bucket.

1843
01:38:02,586 --> 01:38:05,381
How can we score
if he controls the game, Doc?

1844
01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:07,192
Whoa! Where my Goons at?

1845
01:38:07,216 --> 01:38:08,443
Right here, Coach!

1846
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:12,888
No mercy!

1847
01:38:12,971 --> 01:38:16,558
That no-good,
despicable son of a glitch!

1848
01:38:19,853 --> 01:38:21,146
Yo! That's it!

1849
01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:23,399
Your move, Dad. Remember?

1850
01:38:23,482 --> 01:38:24,482
The step-back glitch.

1851
01:38:24,608 --> 01:38:26,860
In and out, crossover,
step back, shoot.

1852
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,487
That move froze my whole game.

1853
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:29,714
And that's good because...

1854
01:38:29,738 --> 01:38:30,757
If the game crashes,

1855
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:32,741
AI G. won't be able
to control it anymore.

1856
01:38:32,825 --> 01:38:34,201
And if he can't control it,

1857
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:36,412
- he can't stop us from scoring.
- Right!

1858
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:39,039
- Oh, boy!
- Yeah! Yay!

1859
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:40,624
Wait.

1860
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,137
- That's not gonna work.
- Why not?

1861
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:46,463
When my character did the step-back,
it got deleted.

1862
01:38:47,256 --> 01:38:49,967
So, whoever does the glitch move...

1863
01:38:50,426 --> 01:38:52,177
Will get deleted.

1864
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:57,474
So, I say, so I guess
we're drawing straws.

1865
01:38:57,558 --> 01:38:59,268
We are not doing that.

1866
01:39:00,269 --> 01:39:01,478
We'll think of something else.

1867
01:39:01,562 --> 01:39:03,814
What about the old alley-oop?

1868
01:39:03,981 --> 01:39:05,107
I'm gonna do the step-back.

1869
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:08,986
What? No. Dad, you'll be deleted.

1870
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:11,363
I'm not a video game character.
I think I'll be okay.

1871
01:39:11,447 --> 01:39:13,216
Dad, you don't know that.
I've done the calculations.

1872
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,240
Dom.

1873
01:39:14,575 --> 01:39:15,993
Somebody's gotta do something.

1874
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:18,078
LeBron, you don't have to do this.

1875
01:39:18,162 --> 01:39:19,246
No!

1876
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:20,664
Listen, just get me the ball.

1877
01:39:21,665 --> 01:39:22,666
Hands in.

1878
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:27,963
Tune Squad on three.

1879
01:39:28,297 --> 01:39:29,631
One, two, three...

1880
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:31,175
Tune Squad!

1881
01:39:43,353 --> 01:39:44,438
Here we go.

1882
01:39:49,776 --> 01:39:50,819
Yeah, this is fun, huh?

1883
01:39:51,612 --> 01:39:54,531
We should just do it again,
and again, and again.

1884
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:58,202
Just over, and over, and over
for all eternity.

1885
01:40:01,163 --> 01:40:02,414
How's that sound?

1886
01:40:02,581 --> 01:40:03,957
Ten seconds on the clock.

1887
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:08,128
The Tunes are one style point play
away from victory,

1888
01:40:09,129 --> 01:40:10,172
or defeat.

1889
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:24,853
This is their last chance.

1890
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:27,064
Bugs, what are you doing?

1891
01:40:27,231 --> 01:40:29,024
And it looks like a broken play!

1892
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:33,111
In and out, crossover, step back...

1893
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,280
Bugs, no!

1894
01:40:35,447 --> 01:40:37,908
Shoot!

1895
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:58,345
Bugs' shot is gonna be short.

1896
01:41:03,392 --> 01:41:06,061
But wait,
LeBron is flying through the air!

1897
01:41:10,983 --> 01:41:12,150
Come on, Dad.

1898
01:41:19,366 --> 01:41:20,367
Oh, no.

1899
01:41:24,121 --> 01:41:25,747
He's not gonna make it.

1900
01:41:26,707 --> 01:41:27,874
He's... He's not...

1901
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:29,585
Gonna make it.

1902
01:41:30,669 --> 01:41:31,670
No.

1903
01:41:52,399 --> 01:41:54,026
That's cheating!

1904
01:42:17,382 --> 01:42:19,968
Great. Posterized.

1905
01:42:25,766 --> 01:42:28,310
Yeah! Yes! Let's go!

1906
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:30,062
Whoo!

1907
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:32,356
We did it! Yeah!

1908
01:42:32,439 --> 01:42:35,567
- Posterized. Yeah!
- Beep, beep.

1909
01:42:37,444 --> 01:42:39,571
The Tunes win!
The Tunes win!

1910
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:42,616
Unbelievable!

1911
01:42:42,783 --> 01:42:46,161
AI G. just got turned
into a literal poster.

1912
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:49,122
This is not
how I wanted to go out!

1913
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:51,624
- Yeah!
- I say, I say,

1914
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:53,227
- that's all right!
- That's what I'm talkin' about!

1915
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:54,795
No, no, no, no, no!

1916
01:42:54,878 --> 01:42:56,546
Hold on. No! No!

1917
01:42:56,630 --> 01:42:58,507
<i>Adiós,</i> Goons!

1918
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,550
We won! Whoo-hoo! We won!

1919
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:02,010
Give me a hug!

1920
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:06,181
- Somebody hug me! Anybody?
- I love y'all. Yeah, Tunes!

1921
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:07,516
- All right, Dad!
- Beep, beep.

1922
01:43:08,225 --> 01:43:09,476
Great assist, Dom!

1923
01:43:09,559 --> 01:43:12,270
Whoa!

1924
01:43:27,369 --> 01:43:29,871
Yes! I never doubted you
for a second, LeBron!

1925
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:32,791
We are going home!
Thank you so much!

1926
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:35,293
You are the Akron Hammer.
The chosen one!

1927
01:43:35,377 --> 01:43:38,964
<i>King James, man! I love you!</i>

1928
01:43:39,923 --> 01:43:41,508
<i>We going home.</i>

1929
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:49,266
Bugs...

1930
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:54,563
How'd I do, Coach?

1931
01:43:59,526 --> 01:44:02,446
Bugs, that's the least looney thing
you've ever done.

1932
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:03,905
You got that right.

1933
01:44:04,072 --> 01:44:07,993
But taking care of the people you love
is fundamental.

1934
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,536
Right, Doc?

1935
01:44:12,664 --> 01:44:13,874
Thank you.

1936
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:17,961
Goodbye, Bron.

1937
01:44:59,294 --> 01:45:00,545
We did it.

1938
01:45:03,006 --> 01:45:05,550
We're all back together again.

1939
01:45:07,093 --> 01:45:08,345
Bugs.

1940
01:45:08,512 --> 01:45:10,138
That's all, folks.

1941
01:45:34,412 --> 01:45:35,997
- Son?
- Dad.

1942
01:45:41,753 --> 01:45:43,231
- You're all right, right?
- I'm good.

1943
01:45:43,255 --> 01:45:44,381

01:45:44,464 --> 01:45:45,757
All right, let's go home.

1945
01:45:47,968 --> 01:45:48,969
Come here, boy.

1946
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:52,305

1949
01:45:55,226 --> 01:45:57,078

1950
01:45:57,102 --> 01:45:58,520
I'm so proud of you!

1951
01:45:58,603 --> 01:45:59,771
All my family.

01:45:59,938 --> 01:46:00,939
My goodness.

1953
01:46:01,022 --> 01:46:02,708

- We love you, too.

1954
01:46:02,732 --> 01:46:04,043
Come on, Malik.
Come on in, man.

1955
01:46:04,067 --> 01:46:05,253
You the Bron, man!

1956
01:46:05,277 --> 01:46:06,712
It's a family affair, man. Come on in.

1957
01:46:06,736 --> 01:46:08,780
LeBron! LeBron.

1958
01:46:08,864 --> 01:46:10,365
Hey, Malik, you good?

1959
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:11,741
No. No, man.

1960
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:13,302
- You cryin'?
- What?

1961
01:46:13,326 --> 01:46:14,326
All right.

1962
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:16,207
- I ain't crying, bruh.
- Okay.

1963
01:46:21,793 --> 01:46:23,712
So, Dom,
you ready for basketball camp?

1964
01:46:23,795 --> 01:46:25,356
Yeah. I'm actually pretty excited.

1965
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:27,358
Yeah? Because I know
how much you really wanted...

1966
01:46:27,382 --> 01:46:30,552
I think I'mma just take a break
from video games for now.

1967
01:46:30,635 --> 01:46:32,262
You know, after we...

1968
01:46:32,345 --> 01:46:33,930
Got sucked into one?

1969
01:46:34,014 --> 01:46:35,056
Yeah.

1970
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:37,559
Really? Because, like...

1971
01:46:38,184 --> 01:46:39,978
I mean, I feel like I've made a mistake.

1972
01:46:40,395 --> 01:46:42,856
I mean, we can turn around
right now if you want to.

1973
01:46:43,356 --> 01:46:44,858
What are you talking about?

1974
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:48,278
Look.

1975
01:46:57,370 --> 01:47:00,332
I mean, I figured
it's about time for you to do you.

1976
01:47:02,626 --> 01:47:03,728
Thank you, Dad.

1977
01:47:03,752 --> 01:47:05,045
You're welcome.

1978
01:47:05,128 --> 01:47:06,796
Hey, man, have fun.

1979
01:47:09,382 --> 01:47:10,383
Yo, Dom.

1980
01:47:11,176 --> 01:47:12,344
Ball?

1981
01:47:17,891 --> 01:47:19,434
I think I'mma hold onto it.

1982
01:47:29,319 --> 01:47:31,696
Aw, that's so sweet.

1983
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:33,073
What's up, Doc?

1984
01:47:33,531 --> 01:47:35,951
- Bugs! How did you...
- Come on.

1985
01:47:36,034 --> 01:47:38,578
You didn't think you'd get rid of me
that easily, did you?

1986
01:47:39,037 --> 01:47:41,539
I told ya, I'm a Tune, Doc!

1987
01:47:41,623 --> 01:47:43,333
I can survive anything!

1988
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:45,502
It's good to see you, buddy.

1989
01:47:45,585 --> 01:47:48,755
Oh, by the way, you think I could
crash at your pad for a few days?

1990
01:47:48,838 --> 01:47:50,733
Of course. There's more
than enough room for you.

1991
01:47:50,757 --> 01:47:52,550
Great! I've never been to Tinseltown.

1992
01:47:52,634 --> 01:47:53,843
I wanna go on a star tour.

1993
01:47:53,927 --> 01:47:55,470
I hear they love drinking juice here.

1994
01:47:55,553 --> 01:47:56,972
Oh, do they make carrot juice?

1995
01:47:57,055 --> 01:47:58,324
They juice anything for you here.

1996
01:47:58,348 --> 01:48:00,225
Oh, hey, can I stay for Taco Tuesday?

1997
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:02,477
Taco Tuesday! No doubt.

1998
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,437
Hope you and Mrs. LeBron got bunk beds

1999
01:48:04,521 --> 01:48:06,481

who wanna visit.

2000
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:08,044
Hold up, hold up. Bunk beds?

2001
01:48:08,108 --> 01:48:10,902
That's right.
I brought the whole gang with me!

2002
01:48:10,986 --> 01:48:12,254
What do you mean, "the whole gang"?

2003
01:48:12,278 --> 01:48:13,947
You can't get rid of us now, Doc.

2004
01:48:14,030 --> 01:48:15,532

"I need this to work"</i>

01:49:12,255 --> 01:49:14,340
<i>Jumped the line
Like I needed it first</i>
