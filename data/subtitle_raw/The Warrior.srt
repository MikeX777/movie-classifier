1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,080
Gather up!

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,680
- Get together, lazy bums!
- Hurry up!

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,600
Let's go!

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,840
Hurry, go!

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,800
Let's go!

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,600
Gather up in the field!

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,960
Come on, faster!

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,000
Stand in order!

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,800
Fall in line, faster!

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,280
Come on, go! Walk!

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,880
Come on!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Attention!

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,880
Salute!

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,040
Report!

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,240
There are 90 flocks of inlanders,

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,360
consisting of rebels and dissidents
who do not want to pay taxes.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,000
The robbers and criminals
are ready to do forced labor.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,400
Report completed!

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,040
Lieutenant!

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,640
Where's the prisoner from Kandanghaur
who rebelled against the Company?

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,600
He's on the left end of the line,
ready to be interrogated.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,560
Here he is, sir.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,440
De Boer,

24
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,320
you have to treat this man seriously.

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,520
I have a hunch that
this guy is very dangerous.

26
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,280
Yes, sir!

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,760
What's your name, young man?

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
Answer my question, rascal!

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,520
My name's Parmin.

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,720
People call me Jaka Sembung.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,000
Your people call me a rebel.

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Satisfied?

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
How disrespectful!

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,160
Betron!

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Tell them all to leave!

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,440
Yes, sir!

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
Line, right-face...

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,600
go!

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,520
Walk! Go!

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,160
Hurry up!

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Let's go!

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,480
Move!

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Hurry up!

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,760
- Good morning, Maria.
- Good morning, Daddy.

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,120
All of you can go.

46
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,680
- Daddy.
- Yes?

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,160
You torture the prisoners every day.

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,080
They're already weak and suffering.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How can they work well?

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,720
Maria,

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,360
not only do rebels have to work,

52
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
they also have to be taught discipline.

53
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
We must not be weak.

54
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,200
We're in charge.

55
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,960
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

56
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
Hey!

57
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480
You just got to work
and you already wanna drink?

58
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,040
I'm thirsty, sir.

59
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
Get to work!

60
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,840
Come on, stand up.

61
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't help him!

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,640
Come, get on!

63
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
Continue.

64
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,080
Work! Come on, back to work!

65
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,880
Hurry up!

66
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,640
Save him.

67
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,120
Get those bastards!

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,840
Chase them! Don't let them get away!

69
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,840
Run!

70
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,920
- Everybody, run!
- Come on!

71
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,320
What?

72
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,520
Jaka Sembung got away?

73
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,080
Bloody hell.

74
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,280
You are crazy, man.

75
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,000
That's crazy!

76
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,040
For him to stoop this low...

77
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,960
He's a dangerous man!

78
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,720
You must hurry and catch him, De Boer!

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,840
Do you understand?

80
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,480
Yes, sir!

81
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,800
I'll do it immediately!

82
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,560
Wait, Captain.

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,440
Catching Jaka Sembung won't be easy.

84
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,640
His followers are everywhere.

85
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,240
Wouldn't it be better if we ask
Resident Cirebon

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,960
and Governor Hederald himself
in Batavia for help?

88
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,160
No, it won't.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
They'll laugh at us

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,240
if they find out that we failed to solve
such a small matter.

91
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,720
Wait, Captain.

92
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
Didn't the Batavian government
enact divisive policy

93
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,960
to deal with the indigenous people?

94
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,160
I don't agree with that kind of policy.

95
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,160
I'd rather just kill anyone
who rebels against the government.

96
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
Your way of thinking is too shallow,
De Boer.

97
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,120
You only know how to kill people,

98
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,920
even though there's
one more effective tactic.

99
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,920
What do you suggest?

100
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,400
There are many heroes in this country,
yes.

101
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,880
Let's gather them to catch Jaka Sembung.

102
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,080
How?

103
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,640
Let's make it a contest.

104
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,800
Exactly.

105
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
"A contest!"

106
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:39,080
"Looking for tough champions
to catch a master robber

107
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,040
named Jaka Sembung."

108
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,480
"The prize is a hundred gold."

109
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,160
"Signed, Captain Van Schram."

110
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,400
{\an8}CONTEST

111
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
{\an8}A contest!

112
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
A contest!

113
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
A contest!

114
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,440
A contest!

115
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
Water.

116
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
CATCH A MASTER ROBBER NAMED JAKA SEMBUNG

117
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Stop.

118
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,120
What do you want?

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,080
Don't ask!

120
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,880
Hey, wait!

121
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
Stop!

122
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,640
Surround him!

123
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,920
Get him!

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
What's that noise outside?

125
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,520
I don't know, sir.

126
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
Come!

127
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,880
Come to me!

128
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Come!

129
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,480
What do you want, making a fuss here?

130
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
I want to meet <i>Meneer</i> Van Schram.

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
What do you want with me?

132
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,800
I'll join your contest

133
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,640
if you pay me 300 gold.

134
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,000
Right, sure.

135
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,440
Of course.

136
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,680
But you

137
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,720
must be tested first.

138
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,000
That's because Jaka Sembung
is not an ordinary man.

139
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,400
You understand?

140
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,560
He can be a master,

141
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,240
but Kobar

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,720
is a hero of all masters, sir.

143
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
Good.

144
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,280
Prove it!

145
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,160
Parmin,

146
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm worried.

147
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,120
Right now, your enemy

148
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,680
is not only the Company,

149
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
but also their mercenary heroes.

150
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,920
<i>Hubbul wathan minal iman.</i>

151
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,280
"Love for our motherland
is part of faith."

152
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
They'll be damned
for helping the non-believers,

153
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,120
especially the ones
who kill their comrades.

154
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,120
Parmin,
you're a known leader of the people here.

155
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,400
Don't stay in one place.

156
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,760
<i>La haula wa la quwwata illa billah.</i>

157
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,200
"There is nothing that happens
without His permission."

158
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,640
That's true,
but there are a lot of spies here.

159
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,520
You better gather your forces
in a safe place.

160
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,240
Okay.

161
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,480
I understand how you feel, Surti.

162
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,480
If God wills it,

163
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,840
I will face the Company
and the apostate heroes who oppose us

164
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,800
until my very last breath.

165
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,720
Open up!

166
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,800
Open the door!

167
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,920
- Everyone, hide!
- Okay.

168
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
Come on, hurry up!

169
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,400
Where's the so-called Jaka Sembung?

170
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,720
Where?

171
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,600
He isn't here.

172
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,280
This isn't his house!

173
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,560
Great!

174
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,080
Turns out that
Jaka Sembung is just a coward!

175
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Come on!

176
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,760
Let go!

177
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,080
Let go!

178
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Shut up!

179
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
It seems you're working with the Company

180
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,720
that's just greedy for money!

181
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,720
Shut up!

182
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,560
Indeed, Kobar needs money.

183
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,200
But I also need your head!

184
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
A hero whose basis
isn't religious knowledge

185
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,760
only becomes a tool for murder.

186
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,400
Oh, my God.

187
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,080
Wait!

188
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,480
Go home if you don't want
to end up like him...

189
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,720
and tell your master
that Kobar died in my hands.

190
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,720
Let's go.

191
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,880
I was amazed by his power.

192
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,640
How strong would our army be
if someone like him would unite with us?

193
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,720
All of you can go.

194
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:19,960
Go.

195
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,040
- Excuse us, sir.
- Excuse us, sir.

196
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,920
- Excuse us, sir.
- Excuse us.

197
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
Kobar is dead.

198
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,040
Which hero should we look forward to,
then?

199
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,960
At this rate, where's our pride, sir?

200
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,160
What do you mean, Lieutenant?

201
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
We have troops.

202
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,520
We have enough weapons to destroy them.

203
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,840
But I don't want that.

204
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,640
Why?

205
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Because other than
our use of tactics and policy,

206
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,520
I want the indigenous people to know

207
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,000
that we colonists don't like violence.

208
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,320
Good afternoon, sir.

209
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,200
Who is he, Van Holland?

210
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,000
He's a shaman
who wants to join the contest.

211
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,520
He can bring a corpse back to life
to kill Jaka Sembung.

212
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,560
What?

213
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,480
Really?

214
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,760
Is it possible, <i>Meneer</i> Van Holland?

215
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,520
Even the great Kobar was defeated.

216
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,320
Let alone a corpse.

217
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,120
Sorry, sir.

218
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
Even though Ki Hitam's a corpse,

219
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,440
he has <i>Rawe Rontek</i> magic

220
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,880
that gives him immortality.

221
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,960
When a part of his body is cut off,

222
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,120
it can come back to life

223
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,400
when it hits the ground.

224
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,360
Nonsense!

225
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,600
If your story is true,
why would he still be a corpse?

226
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,280
Because his head was hung on a tree

227
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,800
and his body was kept
in a separate coffin.

228
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,160
He was defeated by Ki Sapu Angin,

229
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,560
Jaka Sembung's teacher.

230
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
All your stories are lies!

231
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,960
You swindler!

232
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,720
You only want this, right?

233
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,600
No!

234
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,840
Help me!

235
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,480
Help, let me go!

236
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,440
Help me!

237
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,000
Help me!

238
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,440
Let me go!

239
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,800
Let me go!

240
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
Help me!

241
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,000
Help me, sir!

242
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,920
Put him down.

243
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,160
My heart...

244
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,840
You better bring Ki Hitam
back to life to help us.

245
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,880
Yes, sir.

246
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,320
Next time, watch your mouth.

247
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,560
Oh, god. Your magic is so magnificent.

248
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,320
For the will and the power
that controls the universe,

249
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,760
I call you, Ki Hitam,

250
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,720
inside your dark coffin

251
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,680
to be present again in this life.

252
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,920
Search for your head.

253
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,760
I'll follow your steps.

254
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Wake up, Ki Hitam.

255
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
Ki Bidin, my friend,

256
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,960
I know you purposely
brought me back to life

257
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,960
to help your employers, those foreigners.

258
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,280
Yes, to kill Jaka Sembung,

259
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,360
Ki Sapu Angin's student,

260
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,320
and our great enemy.

261
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,680
All right.

262
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,440
I'll atone for my defeat.

263
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,880
Let's start!

264
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,040
Come on, get out!

265
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,240
Come on, go there!

266
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,400
Hurry! Go out!

267
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,800
You're so slow!

268
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
Forgive us.

269
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,040
Hurry up! Faster!

270
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
Gather all of them up at the square!

271
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,280
Hurry up!

272
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,600
- Here's your order.
- Thank you, sir.

273
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,440
Jeez!

274
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,360
Come on!

275
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,160
All of you, come out!

276
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Gather over there!

277
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,240
Come on!

278
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,840
Catch them and gather them up!

279
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,880
Don't move!

280
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,960
Come with us!

281
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,000
You know what this is?

282
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Where are you going?

283
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,600
You crazy Dutchmen!

284
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,000
- You're crazy!
- Don't run!

285
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,960
Crazy Company!

286
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,560
Crazy Dutchmen!

287
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,160
Out of my way! The Company's there!

288
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,040
- I have to go there. What happened?
- Move!

289
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,040
Step aside!

290
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,800
You're crazy!

291
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,840
Step aside, sir, I wanna pass!

292
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,800
You...

293
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
- Step aside, sir!
- Wait!

294
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,840
Step aside!

295
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,320
- Help!
- Crazy Dutchmen!

296
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,000
There are crazy Dutchmen!

297
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
What's wrong with Harjah?

298
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,840
- Hey!
- What happened?

299
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,480
- What happened?
- What's wrong, Ja?

300
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,160
- What's with the noise?
- The Dutch?

301
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,160
- Crazy Dutchmen're going there!
- What's going on with them?

302
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,120
Going there.

303
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,560
Where's Parmin?

304
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,560
Over there.

305
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,120
- Let's go!
- Come on.

306
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,760
Parmin.

307
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,760
The village was ransacked
and everyone was arrested by the Company.

308
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,200
What should we do?

309
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,680
Everyone calm down.

310
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,800
Don't take any action.

311
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,880
Hey, you inlanders!

312
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,040
You probably already know

313
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
why the Dutch government is in charge.

314
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,520
We want to make this country prosperous,

315
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,600
rich with spices,

316
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,040
and free from the rebels and robbers
like Jaka Sembung.

317
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,560
He's a bad guy.

318
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,840
All of you have to tell us

319
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,640
where Jaka Sembung is hiding,
you understand?

320
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,480
No! Jaka Sembung isn't a criminal!

321
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,640
He's a hero of justice and truth!

322
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,880
Shut up!

323
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,680
Back off!

324
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
- Hey, come here!
- No!

325
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,200
- I don't want to!
- No!

326
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,400
Let go!

327
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
- Come!
- I don't want to!

328
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,480
- I'm afraid!
- Sir, don't kill my child!

329
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,640
She's my only child, sir!

330
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,680
- Mom!
- No!

331
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,960
No!

332
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,120
Calm down, ma'am!

333
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,040
No!

334
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,120
No!

335
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,320
I'll count to three.

336
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,560
You're going to tell me
where Jaka Sembung is hiding.

337
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,680
Don't kill my child, sir!

338
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,040
- Mom!
- Hurry up!

339
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,240
- Mom!
- Please don't, sir!

340
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
If you don't,

341
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,760
my bullets will go through
this child's head.

342
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,360
- Mom!
- Please don't, sir!

343
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,880
Ma'am, calm down!

344
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,880
One!

345
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,480
Mom!

346
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Two!

347
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,000
Three!

348
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,120
Hey, foreigner!

349
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,640
I can't bear to see a child die
just because of me.

350
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,560
Really?

351
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,400
Looks like you finally gave up, asshole!

352
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,760
No! Don't give up, Warrior!

353
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Let my child be the victim!

354
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,200
Continue your fight!

355
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,120
Yes! Don't give up, Warrior!

356
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,080
Yes! That's true!

357
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,760
- Don't give up!
- Don't give up!

358
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,280
Continue!

359
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,440
Continue! Don't give up!

360
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,280
- Go! Continue!
- Go, Jaka!

361
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,720
Calm down!

362
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,080
- God is great!
- God is great!

363
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,520
We don't need to worry!

364
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,920
The struggle to liberate this country

365
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,520
will not stop even without me.

366
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,880
If one goes, there'll be another!

367
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,360
I admire your dirtiness.

368
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,320
Bastard!

369
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,360
Everyone, step aside!

370
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Dammit!

371
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
Harjah, where are you going?

372
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,520
Don't act like a hero.
Everyone, get behind me!

373
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
Good job, Ki Hitam! Great!

374
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,440
Tie him up,
and take him around the village...

375
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,440
so that everyone knows

376
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,760
what punishment awaits
for a robber like him!

377
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,320
- Jaka Sembung's been arrested!
- What? Where?

378
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,240
Over there!

379
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,280
Mr. Bendol, come out!

380
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,560
- What happened?
- Jaka Sembung has been arrested!

381
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,080
Hurry up!

382
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,520
Come out!

383
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,760
What's wrong, sir?

384
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,640
- Pull him!
- Make way!

385
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,720
- Get out of the way!
- Go!

386
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,200
Hurry up!

387
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
Hurry up!

388
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,760
Keep going!

389
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,080
Come on!

390
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,200
Step aside! Out of the way!

391
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,080
Step aside!

392
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,920
Everyone, step aside!

393
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,680
Open the way!

394
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,240
- Parmin!
- Move!

395
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,040
Come on, faster!

396
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,040
Hurry up and walk!

397
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,640
Get out of here!

398
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,800
Step aside!

399
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,200
- Step aside!
- Parmin!

400
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,760
- Hurry up!
- Parmin!

401
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,720
- Step aside!
- Parmin!

402
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
Hurry up! Go ahead!

403
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,440
Put him in a cage!

404
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,120
Don't give him anything to drink or eat!

405
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,040
Come on!

406
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,600
Go ahead!

407
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,960
Hurry up!

408
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
- Hurry up!
- Okay!

409
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,520
Come on!

410
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,480
Hurry up!

411
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Hey, look. It's him.

412
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,080
Come here!

413
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,240
Hurry up!

414
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,680
Come on!

415
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,680
Come on, hurry up!

416
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,600
Get in there!

417
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,040
Where are you going this late?

418
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,880
Dad, we can't just do nothing.

419
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
We have to hurry and free Parmin.

420
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,760
You mean we'll invade their camp?

421
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,320
Yes, Dad.

422
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,200
No, my daughter.

423
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Our strength can't be compared to theirs.

424
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,560
It's just the same as suicide.

425
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,520
That's the risk of war, Dad.

426
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,800
I can't bear to see the Dutch cruelty
against Parmin.

427
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,280
We have to free him, Dad.

428
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,200
We have to free him!

429
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,760
Calm down, Surti.

430
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,360
Calm down.

431
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,160
I know you love Parmin.

432
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,200
Dad.

433
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,400
Let's hope for the best,

434
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,680
and may God make a way for all of us.

435
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,080
Who are you?

436
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,520
Jaka, I'm here.

437
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,960
What're you doing here?

438
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,120
Calm down. I want to set you free.

439
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,600
I'm a rebel,

440
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,480
a criminal,

441
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,560
and your father's captive.

442
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
That's true, Jaka.

443
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,000
But you're a warrior of your people.

444
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,960
I'm surprised...

445
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,200
that someone like you calls me a warrior.

446
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,000
Jaka, I pity you,

447
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,240
- and...
- Maria...

448
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,240
can you take your hand off my face?

449
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,240
Why?

450
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,360
My religion forbids it.

451
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,240
Okay.

452
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,440
Don't get me wrong.

453
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,600
I'm here to set you free.

454
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,120
Maria.

455
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,480
Well done.

456
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,320
You did very well, didn't you?

457
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,760
Daddy heard everything you said.

458
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,280
Come here, sweetheart.

459
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,960
I said come here, dammit!

460
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,440
I'll take you back to Holland

461
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,760
and don't ever dream
of coming back to Java.

462
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,800
Do you understand?

463
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,800
Dammit!

464
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,840
And you, rebel.

465
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,040
I'll torture you before I hang you!

466
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,920
Dad, no!

467
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,040
Dad, no!

468
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,160
Dad!

469
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,000
Step aside!

470
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,120
You're so cruel, Dad.

471
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,720
You want a smoke?

472
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,920
It's quite cold.

473
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,120
- You bring it?
- I lit the fire.

474
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,720
Who's that?

475
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,840
Don't run!

476
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,600
Chase him!

477
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,560
Stop!

478
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,800
- Come here!
- Catch him!

479
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,440
- Genteng!
- Yes, sir!

480
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,160
Who is it?

481
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,880
Come on!

482
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,200
She's Jaka Sembung's subordinate.

483
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,600
Very well.

484
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,560
Good.

485
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,560
So you're here to free your leader?

486
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,920
- Genteng!
- Yes, sir!

487
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,920
Put her in jail!

488
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,040
Dammit!

489
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
Come on!

490
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,840
- Move.
- Get in there!

491
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,720
- Stay still!
- Who is she?

492
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,640
A prisoner, sir.

493
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,320
Come on!

494
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,400
Let me go!

495
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,400
Get in there!

496
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,920
Let's go.

497
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,400
Open up!

498
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,640
Open the door!

499
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,640
Let me go!

500
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,880
Let me go!

501
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,160
Open up!

502
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,600
Open the door!

503
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,880
Let me go!

504
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,440
Surti.

505
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,960
Forget it, Miss.

506
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,040
Don't dwell in sadness.

507
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,440
No one dares oppose your dad.

508
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,680
{\an8}Yes, that's true...

509
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,920
{\an8}but I can't leave it like this.

510
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,600
{\an8}Don't ever talk about it anymore.

511
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,680
{\an8}We can't do anything

512
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,120
{\an8}except give up.

513
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,800
It's getting late.

514
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,040
Let it all disappear in your dreams.

515
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,160
God.

516
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,960
God.

517
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,240
Oh, God.

518
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,000
Oh, God.

519
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,960
God.

520
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,560
God...

521
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,440
God...

522
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,160
God...

523
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,760
God.

524
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,360
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

525
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,920
Parmin.

526
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,200
- Parmin.
- Surti.

527
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,800
- Your eyes.
- Yes.

528
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,520
We have to go.

529
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,920
Get out! All of you!

530
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,880
Shoot them!

531
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,920
Come on, get out!

532
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,120
Wait!

533
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,080
Wait!

534
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,840
I'll be in front!

535
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,160
- Let's go!
- Come on!

536
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,240
Come on!

537
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,800
Halt!

538
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,800
Patience.

539
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,040
This is my business.

540
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,880
You don't have powers anymore.

541
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,120
Parmin!

542
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,040
Hold!

543
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Let her run!

544
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,480
Let her bleed to death!

545
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,360
I'm worried

546
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,840
about Jaka Sembung's fate.

547
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,440
What if he turns back into a human

548
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,640
and takes revenge?

549
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,800
No, sir.

550
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,440
That pig'll either starve to death

551
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,720
or be killed by the villagers.

552
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,320
{\an8}Sir, you should know

553
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,040
{\an8}Muslims in this village really hate pigs.

554
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,760
Let's kill it!

555
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,440
Pigs are haram!

556
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,040
Pigs are haram!

557
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,560
No! Don't beat him!

558
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,840
Don't kill him!

559
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,520
Don't kill him!

560
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Parmin.

561
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,920
Calm down, I'll help you.

562
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,880
Come on, kid.

563
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,120
You're so pitiful, Jaka.

564
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,120
It's hard to fight Ki Hitam's magic.

565
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,960
Hopefully, with God's permission,

566
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,600
I can turn you back into a human.

567
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,640
I seek refuge in God from Shaitan,
the accursed one.

568
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,440
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

569
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,360
God...

570
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,000
May it be so, O Lord of the Worlds.

571
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,120
Teacher.

572
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,080
Come here.

573
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,600
Your opponents are highly skilled.

574
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,040
You're no match for them.

575
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,800
Your powers need to be replenished.

576
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,760
In this blindness,

577
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,360
how could I do that?

578
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,040
Don't worry, Jaka.

579
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:59,640
A follower of yours who secretly loves you
has given up her eyes.

580
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,760
Who is she, Teacher?

581
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,840
Surti.

582
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,400
Surti?

583
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,880
She just passed away a moment ago.

584
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,920
Where is she, Teacher?

585
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,680
Come with me.

586
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,680
She's lying in front of you, Jaka.

587
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,720
Surti.

588
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,280
You're my hero...

589
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,880
as well as my lover.

590
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,720
You sacrificed a lot...

591
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,320
to help in this fight, Surti.

592
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,600
I won't forget you, Surti.

593
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,360
Goodbye, Surti.

594
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,320
Verily we belong to God,
and verily to Him do we return.

595
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,840
In the name of God,
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

596
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,360
Good.

597
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,640
You've mastered

598
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,440
the ultimate technique
to fight Rawe Rontek.

599
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,520
Thank you, Teacher.

600
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,040
But you have to remember.

601
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,840
The pieces of his body
should not touch the ground.

602
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,480
My people have lived here long enough.

603
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:30,760
Personally,
I'm against my father's method,

604
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,120
oppressing the indigenous people

605
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,360
in this country.

606
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:41,920
Yes.

607
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,120
Especially for those who hate
the colonial government,

608
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,600
the struggle to liberate this country
from the colonists

609
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,320
is the right of the people themselves,
which is strange.

610
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,440
They're all arrested...

611
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,680
tortured, and imprisoned

612
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,000
without trial.

613
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,960
Even though our people
live from their sweat

614
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,360
and the wealth of the land
of this country.

615
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:21,880
That is the reason why I'm sympathizing
with Jaka Sembung's struggle.

616
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,680
The ideals of the deceased
were very noble.

617
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,200
We all have to support it,
without exception.

618
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,120
If it's not all of you

619
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,640
who'll continue their struggle,

620
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,120
who will?

621
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,880
Jaka?

622
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,120
- Peace be upon you.
- And peace be upon you too.

623
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:04,240
My comrades, I bet you're surprised
to see my complete presence, right?

624
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,240
I'll tell you all about it later.

625
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,280
I heard what you said, Maria.

626
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,320
I didn't expect the child of an invader
would fight with us.

627
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,800
My determination to liberate this country

628
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,800
is also the determination of the people.

629
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,440
We must be one with them.

630
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,720
The people are the backbone of the fight.

631
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,320
And this intention will come true

632
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,560
if Maria wants to help us.

633
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,880
It turns out that
my own child is a traitor...

634
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,320
betraying her father and the Company.

635
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,320
It seems that all this time,

636
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,840
you were secretly meeting
Jaka Sembung's people.

637
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,320
It's true.

638
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,440
Your daughter Maria disagrees
with your arbitrary actions

639
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,120
against indigenous peoples.

640
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:41,560
They fight for their rights.

641
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,920
They want to live freely,

642
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,040
relishing the wealth of their own country.

643
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,640
We just...

644
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,640
live temporarily here.

645
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,360
Dad...

646
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,480
You're so greedy, Dad!

647
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,680
The Company is too cruel!

648
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,120
How can you say that to your own father?

649
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,200
You're such a brazen girl! How rude!

650
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,760
Maria!

651
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,960
Apparently, you believe this
under the incitement of those rebels.

652
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,400
No, Dad!

653
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,640
I realized what I was doing!

654
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,280
Not like them,

655
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:26,080
who betrayed their own people for money!

656
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,200
Dammit!

657
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,520
The two of you...

658
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,000
have to capture Jaka Sembung
who came back to life!

659
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:39,920
Yes.

660
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,280
We're ready.

661
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,520
Sir's orders will be fulfilled.

662
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,200
Good.

663
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,440
If you fail,

664
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,040
both of your heads
will be the replacement.

665
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,640
- Understand?
- Understood, sir.

666
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,920
God is great.

667
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,560
- God is great.
- God is great.

668
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,040
- God is great.
- God is great.

669
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,880
- God is great.
- God is great.

670
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:21,960
Peace be upon you,

671
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,920
as well as the mercy of God
and his blessings.

672
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,840
Peace be upon you as well.

673
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,400
Peace be upon you, as well as
the mercy of God and his blessings.

674
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,960
Peace be upon you, as well as the mercy
of God and his blessings.

675
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,560
- Praise be to God.
- Amen.

676
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,320
May prayer and safety be given...

677
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,720
Amen.

678
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,680
Don't!

679
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,720
You're not his equal.

680
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,080
Hey, you apostates!

681
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,440
What did you come here for?

682
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:06,400
Do you want to know
that I'm no longer a blind pig?

683
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,720
It turns out you're a student
of Ki Sapu Angin,

684
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,920
my nemesis.

685
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,920
I've prepared a grave for you...

686
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,440
the arrogant Jaka.

687
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,000
Thank you,

688
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,360
but my spirit will be sad

689
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,360
if I die at the hands
of Company minions like you.

690
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:01,680
You can choose any part of my body...

691
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,120
all you want.

692
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,360
<i>You have to remember.</i>

693
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,920
<i>The pieces of his body
should not touch the ground.</i>

694
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,800
Burn him!
Make sure not to touch the ground!

695
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,120
- Let's go, carry him!
- Carry him!

696
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,280
Take it there!

697
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,800
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

698
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,840
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

699
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,000
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

700
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,600
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

701
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,640
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

702
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,920
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

703
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,800
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

704
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,800
- Harder!
- One,

705
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,160
- two, three.
- Let's go!

706
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,920
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

707
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,800
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

708
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,960
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

709
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,840
- Attack!
- Yes!

710
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:00,600
Catch him.

711
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,080
Don't let go! That hurts!

712
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,440
Oh, God!

713
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,880
Come on, Somat, help me!

714
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,080
This is my hand! Help!

715
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,800
Take my hand!

716
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:14,880
Oh, God!

717
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:17,120
Come on!

718
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,400
Don't let go! Oh, God!

719
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,200
Mr. Company, don't let go!

720
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,680
Oh, no! I fell!

721
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,400
Die!

722
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,800
God is great!

723
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,080
God is great!

724
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,000
Separate the men.

725
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,000
Yes, sir.

726
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,200
Come on.

727
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,400
Open all of it!

728
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,520
Get out! Hurry!

729
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,400
Get out! Go!

730
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,240
Get out!

731
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,240
Boys! Come on, everyone!

732
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,600
Kill all of the rebels!

733
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,120
Come on, hurry up!

734
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,080
Get out!

735
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,960
Come on, run!

736
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:08,920
Let's go, Somat!

737
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,520
Come down! You said you wanted to fight!

738
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,760
Van Schram.

739
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,040
Now, you can be proud of your death.

740
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,960
No.

741
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,920
That only applies to you.

742
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,680
You're looking to die, young man!

743
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,200
You rascal!

744
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,000
Miss Maria, wake up!

745
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,600
Jaka Sembung and his friends
are attacking us outside.

746
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,440
- Jaka Sembung?
- Yes, Miss.

747
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,760
You damn rebels!

748
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,120
Dad!

749
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,440
I'm sorry, Maria.

750
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,320
I had to kill your father.

751
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,120
I have no power to avoid this destiny.

752
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,320
He's a great person to your people, Maria.

753
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,680
I respect him.

754
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,520
That's enough, Maria.

755
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,400
Let's bury your father's body properly.

756
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,280
- We'll punish you!
- Maria, watch out!

757
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:16,920
Maria!

758
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:20,960
Maria...

759
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:22,520
Maria!

760
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,080
Dad...

761
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,720
Maria!

762
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,160
Maria!

763
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,360
Jaka...

764
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,040
In this last moment...

765
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,960
I...

766
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,240
want to tell something...

767
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,320
- to you.
- What is it, Maria?

768
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,000
I...

769
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:03,680
love you...

770
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,800
Please continue your fight!

771
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,800
Maria!

772
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,280
Maria!

773
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,320
Maria...
