1
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,134
<i>In the year 1807...</i>

2
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:25,046
<i>... a small ship of the Royal Navy set sail</i>
<i>from England for a secret destination.</i>

3
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,286
<i>With five million French</i>
<i>and Spanish soldiers...</i>

4
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,447
<i>... poised on the continent</i>
<i>under Napoleon...</i>

5
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:36,755
<i>... nothing could save England from invasion</i>
<i>except her 300 ships.</i>

6
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:42,128
<i>HMS</i> Lydia <i>was soon far beyond</i>
<i>battle-charged Europe.</i>

7
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:50,208
<i>Under the most secret of sealed orders,</i>
<i>she sailed deep into southern waters...</i>

8
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,439
<i>... fought her way around the Horn...</i>

9
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,515
<i>... headed north again, into the Pacific.</i>

10
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,080
<i>For seven months,</i>
<i>she stayed out of sight of land.</i>

11
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,424
<i>Becalmed finally...</i>

12
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:12,827
<i>... her weary crew toiled at the oars</i>
<i>in the vain hope of towing her into a wind.</i>

13
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,402
<i>They thirsted and hungered</i>
<i>and wondered where she was going...</i>

14
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,472
<i>... what she would do</i>
<i>when she got there, if she got there.</i>

15
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,338
<i>These were things</i>
<i>known only to one man aboard.</i>

16
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,846
Heave!

17
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,653
Heave!

18
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,353
Heave!

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,316
Heave.

20
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,224
- Heave.
- Heave!

21
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,263
Heave!

22
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,161
Five years hard labor,
the judge says to me...

23
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,601
...or honorable service
in His Majesty's Navy.

24
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,207
What did I pick? Hornblower.

25
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,743
What are we doing in the Pacific, anyway?
I tell you, he's got us lost.

26
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,245
There's islands there
where we could have a picnic.

27
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,748
Brown-skinned girls, bread growing
on trees, where the <i>Bounty</i> went.

28
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,012
Why don't you ask Hornblower
to take us there?

29
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,418
What's wrong with our cargo
doing the asking?

30
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,753
Muskets and ammunition.
Who for? Why not for us?

31
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,259
Come on, get on with your work.
Get on with it.

32
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,633
- You've had your water ration, Carter.
- Me throat's closing up on me.

33
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,172
I can't help that. One-half cup a day.

34
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,539
Officers and crew the same. Even him.

35
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,240
Hornblower? He ain't human.

36
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,152
- Mr. Bush.
- Thank you.

37
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,263
How much do you suppose
he's paced the deck since Plymouth, sir?

38
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,925
Well, an hour a day at three knots,
and we're 201 days out.

39
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,798
I'd say the distance
between Plymouth and Aberdeen.

40
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,701
I'd like to know what he's thinking.

41
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:06,072
What would you think about? A rotting ship
and 10,000 miles from a friendly port.

42
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,023
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

43
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,254
Mr. Bush, would you have the hands
piped aft to witness punishment?

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,297
- Aye, aye, sir.
- What about the towing crews, sir?

45
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,367
- That won't be necessary.
- Very good, sir.

46
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,264
Hands lay aft to witness punishment!

47
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,705
Hands lay aft to witness punishment!

48
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,160
Shoulder arms!

49
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,841
Bosun's mate, do your duty.

50
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,234
Do you know why I'm having
Hommel flogged, Mr. Gerard?

51
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,836
I reported him for fighting, sir.

52
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,997
I'm not having him flogged
for fighting, Mr. Gerard.

53
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,009
I'm having him flogged because you said
in front of the men that you'd flog him.

54
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,738
This is a ship of war.

55
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,143
As its captain, I must uphold
my lieutenant's authority.

56
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,546
I understand, sir.

57
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,279
Flogging only makes a bad man worse,
Mr. Gerard.

58
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,392
And it can break a good man's spirit.

59
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,050
Is Hommel a bad man?

60
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,130
Aside from his temper, sir,
he's a good sailor.

61
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,359
A good sailor, ill-fed and thirsty.

62
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,268
Watch the cat as it cuts his back to pieces,
Mr. Gerard.

63
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:20,401
And in future, perhaps you'll think twice
before you threaten anyone with a flogging.

64
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,415
Dismiss the hands.

65
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,892
- Dismiss the hands.
- Hands dismissed!

66
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,143
Come in.

67
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,339
Yes, doctor?

68
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,511
I'm here to make a representation.

69
00:06:56,682 --> 00:07:00,584
Since the lime juice ran out, the men
are dropping with scurvy every hour.

70
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,551
There's 39 sick and off duty,
49 just sick.

71
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,350
And eight dead. I know the figures.

72
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,559
Nine dead. Hazlitt, a minute ago.

73
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,931
<i>Hazlitt...</i>

74
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,464
He was a good topman.

75
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,503
You'll lose more than Hazlitt if you
don't put ashore for fresh food and water.

76
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,470
Dig into your medical kit
and get me a breath of fresh wind.

77
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,872
There's land to the east.
Have us towed there.

78
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,536
The <i>Lydia</i> will not come within sight of land
until we reach our destination.

79
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,443
Unless you'd have us fail our mission.

80
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,483
I don't know what our mission is
or why we're in the Pacific.

81
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,314
All I know is, three more days...

82
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,150
...and I won't answer for the life
of anyone on this ship.

83
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,757
We continue as before.

84
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,326
- Captain Hornblower.
- You may go, doctor.

85
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,825
Scurvy visits the quarterdeck
as well as the fo'c's'le, sir.

86
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,195
And I know how you've been
driving yourself.

87
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,801
I said you may go.

88
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,495
Deck there!

89
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,877
Now.

90
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,152
- Sixty-five, thirty.
- Mr. Crystal, would you tell the cooper...

91
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,226
...to scald his water casks for filling?
- Very good, sir.

92
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,863
Are we...? Are we towing ashore, sir?

93
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,501
There's no need to stammer, Mr. Gerard.
No, we are not towing ashore.

94
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,296
I expect the wind before morning...

95
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,202
...and we're within a hundred miles
of our destination.

96
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,870
Did you say something, Mr. Crystal?

97
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,206
What with chronometers that haven't
been checked for seven months...

98
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,646
...and Spanish charts
that aren't to be trusted...

99
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,944
...we can be 300 miles
out of our reckoning.

100
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,917
That means five days without food, sir.

101
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,751
Gentlemen, we will raise our destination
within two days.

102
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:24,954
It will be identified by a fortress on a hill
overlooking a large bay.

103
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,728
A fortress and a wind before morning.

104
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,428
Heat's gone to his head.

105
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:35,631
Well, I think he knows
more than he's saying.

106
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:39,005
- Care to take a wage on it, Mr. Bush?
- How much can you afford?

107
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,408
I've got five shillings that says no wind...

108
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,550
...and 10 shillings
that we don't sight any fortress.

109
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,344
Done.

110
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,482
Heave!

111
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,614
Heave!

112
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,118
Heave!

113
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,463
- Course north by west.
- North by west. As if it mattered.

114
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,434
Look at that candle.
Straighter than Hornblower's backbone.

115
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,798
Heave! Heave! Heave!

116
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,667
Heave!

117
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,733
Heave!

118
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,267
The wind!

119
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,331
Call the watch!

120
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,637
Call the starboard watch!

121
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,172
Come on, there!

122
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,785
- Hands aloft to secure!
- Come on, get aloft there!

123
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,685
Watch the clew lines there!

124
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,465
Fo'c's'le party, take in the towing cable!

125
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,972
Haul in those tow lines!

126
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,609
Secure the guns!

127
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,415
Secure the guns!

128
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,418
Make these guns fast!

129
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,661
Away with the yards!

130
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,679
- Keep her into the wind.
- Aye, aye, sir.

131
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,916
Away with the stays!

132
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,959
Watch it there, Mr. Longley.

133
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,568
- Up the shrouds.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,343
That's five shillings, Mr. Crystal.

135
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,306
There's still 10 shillings
riding on that fortress.

136
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,382
You were right, sir.
Blowing nice and steady.

137
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,220
Aye. Nice and steady.

138
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,022
- Everything secure aloft?
- Aye, aye, sir.

139
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,272
Starboard your helm.
Let the wind take her.

140
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,492
- I'll have my lunch now, Polwheal.
- Aye, sir.

141
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,971
- You sent for me, sir?
- This ship is getting slack, Mr. Gerard.

142
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,539
It's taking you longer every day
to clear for action.

143
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,041
- The hands are weak, sir, <i>and...</i>
- And what?

144
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,773
Restless, sir. After all, sir,
seven months without sighting land.

145
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,940
That's no excuse.
You ought to control them.

146
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,553
Land ho! Off the starboard bow!

147
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,189
An officer who cannot control his men
is not reliable.

148
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,020
Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir,
that was "land ho."

149
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,729
- I have ears, Mr. Gerard.
- Thought you'd be interested, sir.

150
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,501
It took you 11 minutes and 20 seconds
to clear for action yesterday.

151
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,263
- I want it done in 10. Now.
- Now, sir?

152
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,839
You seem to have your mind
on something else.

153
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:39,000
- I said now.
- Aye, aye, sir.

154
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:48,016
- Land, sir!
- I said I'd have my lunch now, Polwheal.

155
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,245
Aye, aye, sir.

156
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,790
Fortress off the larboard bow!

157
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,221
A fortress, by Gad.

158
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,630
- He's made it.
- That's 10 more shillings, Mr. Crystal.

159
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,260
And may my liver rot if any other man
in the whole navy could've done it.

160
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,838
Including Lord Hood.

161
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,340
Mr. Longley, my respects to the captain.

162
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,002
- Tell him a fortress off the larboard bow.
- Aye, aye, sir.

163
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,375
If I hadn't been here to see that...

164
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,017
...if any man had told me,
I'd have called him a liar.

165
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,588
Hit it right on the nose,
after 10,000 miles at sea.

166
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,485
Mr. Bush's respects, sir.
Fortress off the larboard bow!

167
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,789
May his liver rot if anyone else
in the ruddy navy could've done it.

168
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,522
Including Lord Hood.

169
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,667
I don't think that Mr. Bush
intended you...

170
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,394
...to convey the last part
of that message, Mr. Longley.

171
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,130
My compliments to Mr. Bush.
Tell him to hold the course.

172
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,673
- I'll be on deck presently.
- Aye, aye, sir.

173
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:47,073
- Mr. Longley.
- Yes, sir?

174
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,840
- Not so much noise on the companion wing.
- Aye, aye, sir.

175
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,109
- Mr. Longley.
- Yes, sir?

176
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,081
The next time, would you knock
before you enter the captain's cabin?

177
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,986
Aye, aye, sir.

178
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,028
- Water casks ready for filling?
- Water casks ready for filling, sir.

179
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,728
- The ship cleared for action?
- Cleared for action, sir.

180
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,568
- Ten minutes and two seconds, sir.
- Very good, Mr. Gerard.

181
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,404
- We'll have the guns loaded and run out.
- Aye, aye, sir.

182
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,510
- Bring her into the wind.
- Aye, sir.

183
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,316
Starboard battery load!

184
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,887
- Ease your helm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

185
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,495
- Let go the anchor, Mr. Bush.
- Aye, aye, sir.

186
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,365
Let go the anchor!

187
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,442
Deck there!

188
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,748
Mr. Bush.

189
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,589
Rum-looking lot, eh, sir?

190
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,457
They're His Majesty's allies, Mr. Bush.

191
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,223
Allies, sir?

192
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,960
I thought that this part of the world
belonged to Spain.

193
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,798
Don Julian Alvarado,
a prince of this country...

194
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,203
...has been persuaded by England
to revolt against Spain.

195
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,572
Then our cargo of arms is for him.

196
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,736
If Don Julian
can conquer Central America...

197
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:31,747
...Spain will have to take ships
and soldiers from Napoleon...

198
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,612
...to preserve her colonies.

199
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:41,082
- Man the side, Mr. Bush.
- Aye, aye, sir.

200
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,659
Man the side!

201
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,710
Captain Hornblower?

202
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,621
I am Don Jose Hernandez,
admiral in the service of El Supremo.

203
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,261
El Supremo? That means the almighty.

204
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,795
El Supremo was formerly known to men
as Don Julian Alvarado.

205
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,361
And where is this Don Julian Alvarado?

206
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,974
El Supremo is in his fortress.
You will come with me now.

207
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,781
Mr. Bush...

208
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,179
...here are the keys to my dispatch box
containing the Admiralty's orders.

209
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,519
If I'm not back aboard by midnight...

210
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,789
...you assume command.
- Not back aboard, sir?

211
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,728
But you said they were on our side.

212
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,233
War breeds strange allies, Mr. Bush.

213
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,762
Captain Horatio Hornblower,
at your service.

214
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,964
King George of England charges me
with messages of his friendship.

215
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,133
I am not interested
in the words of a mere king.

216
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:52,681
Have you brought me the guns and powder
for my conquest of the Americas?

217
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,513
A thousand muskets,
a million rounds of ammunition...

218
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,919
...and cannon for your fort, senor.
- Human beings do not address me as senor!

219
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,526
Make arrangements with Admiral Hernandez
for landing your cargo.

220
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,455
I can hand over nothing
until my ship is reprovisioned.

221
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,123
I have given you an order!

222
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:16,331
Perhaps outside you saw various criminals
suffering punishment.

223
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,533
They, too, disobeyed me.

224
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,244
If I am not back aboard the <i>Lydia</i>
within one hour...

225
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,976
...she'll train her guns upon your fort
and reduce it to rubble.

226
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,815
- With you in it, captain?
- That is my order.

227
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,241
Such earthly matters are beneath me.
We are allies, are we not?

228
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,401
Make known your needs
to Admiral Hernandez.

229
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,139
Aside from water,
I shall need 200 bullocks...

230
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,283
...500 pigs, 100 quintals of salt...

231
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:08,450
...40 tons of flour, 10 tons of sugar,
five tons of tobacco, one ton of coffee...

232
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,424
...the juice of 40,000 limes...

233
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:14,190
...and are there any wines
to be had here? Spirits?

234
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:18,496
We drink a spirit distilled from molasses
which you probably do not know.

235
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,570
We call it rum. Would that do?

236
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,873
Well, if there's nothing better,
that will have to do.

237
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,203
- One hundred barrels.
- Start now.

238
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,249
When you have landed my weapons,
I intend to move on El Salvador and burn it.

239
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:37,320
- Perhaps you'll accompany me?
- No, my orders are to blockade Panama.

240
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,922
It is your loss.

241
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:43,084
A burning town is a magnificent sight.

242
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,933
You are in luck, captain.

243
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,908
This scum, who enters without knocking,
brings news of a visitor from Panama.

244
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,943
- An ally?
- I hardly think so.

245
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,639
Three months ago the Spanish viceroy
sent a diplomat...

246
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,944
...who warned me to curb
my political ambitions.

247
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,317
In answer, I sent part of him
back to Panama.

248
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,219
His head, to be precise.

249
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,258
Then the Spanish already know
of your plan?

250
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,296
This visitor comes armed
to destroy my city.

251
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,629
She is a Spanish warship of 60 guns,
the <i>Natividad.</i>

252
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,772
A Spanish ship of the line in these waters?
When does she arrive?

253
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,669
According to this wretch, before dawn.

254
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,300
I must take measures to prepare my ship.

255
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,639
See that my provisions
are sent out immediately.

256
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,648
Captain! You will not destroy
the <i>Natividad.</i>

257
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,785
You will capture her
and turn her over to me.

258
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,680
If I capture the <i>Natividad,</i>
she will be a prize belonging to my king.

259
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,850
Your king would not wish you
to offend me.

260
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,822
You were charged
with a mission, captain:

261
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,933
To aid me in my conquest
of the Americas.

262
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,695
If I fail, England fails.

263
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,829
I cannot surrender a British prize ship
without authority from the Admiralty.

264
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:06,102
Think, captain! With two ships,
we could crush all Spanish America.

265
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,042
There are 10,000 troops in Panama
whom you could blockade...

266
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,980
...while I destroyed El Salvador,
Honduras and Costa Rica.

267
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,949
You would be helping
your country's cause.

268
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,384
Before I can turn the <i>Natividad</i> over to you,
senor, I must first capture her.

269
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,790
Now, you must excuse me.

270
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,480
Prepare the boats for storing ship.

271
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,023
There are enough provisions coming
to make us independent for six months.

272
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,161
- Our cargo goes ashore.
- Aye, aye, sir.

273
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,959
Oh, and, Mr. Bush, there's a Spanish ship
of 60 guns due here before dawn.

274
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,198
Send your best lookout
to the top of that hill...

275
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,100
...to warn us of the enemy's approach.
- Aye, aye, sir.

276
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,906
A 60-gunner.
What do you suppose he's up to?

277
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,011
If we don't clear the bay,
I'll wager we're all dead by morning.

278
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,647
- How much can you afford this time?
- Twenty shillings.

279
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,909
Done. Where shall I send the money
if you win?

280
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,146
- Mr. Harrison, get the boats out.
- Aye, aye, sir.

281
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,916
Clear away the boats!

282
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,980
I hear the <i>Natividad's</i>
a 100-gun ship of the line.

283
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,050
We'd better up-anchor
and get out of here.

284
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,882
- Not till we get this grub aboard.
- Look!

285
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,794
- What's it read, Mr. Longley?
- "Ship's royals horizon, southeast."

286
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,726
Lookout station reports
<i>Natividad</i> sighted, sir.

287
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,734
- Thank you. We'll have the lights out.
- All lights out!

288
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,269
Shall I stop the loading, sir?

289
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,636
- No, we've a few hours yet.
- Aren't we gonna run for open water, sir?

290
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,369
We'll remain at anchor here
under the lee of this point.

291
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,103
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, Mr. Bush.

292
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,215
Would you and Mr. Gerard
and Mr. Longley give me the pleasure...

293
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,147
...of your company at supper tonight?
- Thank you, sir.

294
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,947
Tonight, sir?

295
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,784
Our young midshipman may be risking
his life before dawn, Mr. Bush.

296
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,621
His stomach might feel better
with a meal in it.

297
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,721
What if the Spanish attack
while we're at anchor, sir?

298
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,027
The <i>Lydia'd</i> be blown to bits.

299
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,693
And I'd lose 20 shillings.

300
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,314
- Gentlemen, the king.
- The king.

301
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,625
Thank you, sir.

302
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,891
Signal from the point.
<i>Natividad's</i> gone about.

303
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,297
One more tack,
and she'll be at the harbor mouth.

304
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,199
Very good, Mr. Crystal.

305
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,074
Well, gentlemen...

306
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,672
...that leaves us time
for a rubber at whist.

307
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,478
Will you cut for deal, Mr. Longley?

308
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,271
Lookout reports
<i>Natividad's</i> anchored, sir.

309
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,999
- Snugged down for the night, eh?
- Yes, sir.

310
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,370
That's the Spanish for you.

311
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:03,209
I've been gambling that
they would do exactly that.

312
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,172
Now, gentlemen...

313
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,743
...here's what I plan to do.

314
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,958
What a prize she'll make.
We'll all be stinking rich.

315
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,061
Dead, more likely.

316
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:40,117
Don't hurry, Mr. Longley.
It has a bad effect on the men.

317
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,914
- Set them an example. Take your time.
- Aye, aye, sir.

318
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,725
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Crystal.

319
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,914
Wake them up, Mr. Longley.

320
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,143
You may retain your sword, captain.

321
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:01,808
Mr. Bush, will you remove these officers
to the <i>Lydia</i> and put them in irons?

322
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,780
But we have surrendered.
There are rules of war.

323
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,153
Believe me, if Don Julian as much
as sees you during the coming day...

324
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,318
...he'll have you all killed.
Those are his rules of war.

325
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,760
That was wonderful swordplay, sir.

326
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,062
Mr. Longley, when I was a midshipman...

327
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,637
...I was at the bottom of my class
in swordsmanship.

328
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,401
This is the first occasion
I've had to use one of these since.

329
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,568
I hope it's the last.

330
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,591
She's a beauty, sir.

331
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,458
Purser reckons she's worth
120,000 guineas.

332
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,735
That gives every man jack aboard <i>Lydia</i>
50 guineas prize money.

333
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,696
<i>Natividad</i> is not a prize ship, Mr. Bush.

334
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:59,275
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- She's to be used by our ally, Don Julian.

335
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,207
You're giving her away, sir?

336
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,312
But your own share'd be worth 10,000.

337
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,450
I asked for no figures.

338
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,415
But, sir, you yourself
said that Don Julian was mad.

339
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,886
- Can you trust him?
- Rest easy, Mr. Bush.

340
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,992
I alone will have to answer
to the Admiralty for this decision.

341
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,486
Deck there!

342
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:31,131
- An 11 -gun salute, Mr. Bush.
- Aye, aye, sir.

343
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,436
Fire!

344
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:50,322
You'll remember in the future, captain,
that the correct signal for El Supremo...

345
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,826
...is 23 guns.

346
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,521
Our king himself receives only 21.

347
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,760
That is why I always have 23.

348
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:02,804
I have noticed before, captain,
that you have shown a little disrespect.

349
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:07,274
But I have been mild enough to attribute it
to your foreign breeding.

350
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,280
You did not kill many.

351
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,140
No, I didn't want to deprive you
of your crew, Supremo.

352
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,912
I shall kill the officers, then, and replace
them with my own. Where are they?

353
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,852
I greatly regret that I threw them
overboard this morning...

354
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,754
...with their hands and feet tied.
- That is a pity.

355
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,327
I was looking forward
to making an example of them...

356
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,897
...in case any of these wretches
hesitated to serve me.

357
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,762
But there are other ways.

358
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,636
We sail tonight.
You will proceed south to blockade Panama.

359
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:38,173
- I shall take care of the north.
- Mr. Bush, we're returning to the <i>Lydia.</i>

360
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:01,795
I'd like to know why Hornblower
gave that monkey-face our ship.

361
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,759
What happened to our prize money?
I ask you, what happened to it?

362
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,211
Loose and make all plain sail.

363
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:17,472
Loose and make all plain sail!

364
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,416
Sail off the larboard bow!

365
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,991
Keep an eye on her, Mr. Crystal.
She's a Spaniard.

366
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,389
Ease your helm down.

367
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,190
She's hove to
and preparing to lower her boat.

368
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,660
A white flag. I don't like it.

369
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:18,041
- What is she, Mr. Bush?
- Spanish lugger, sir. Flying a white flag.

370
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,268
That'll mean a parley.

371
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:25,113
- Run out a gun.
- Aye, aye, sir.

372
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,581
- Why do the enemy want to speak to us?
- We'll soon know.

373
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:35,954
- Stand by the carronade, Mr. Gerard.
- Stand by the carronade.

374
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,823
There are women aboard.
What are these Spaniards up to?

375
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,429
Women?

376
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,123
You're right, by George.
Better get the sling ready.

377
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:47,362
Mr. Bush, have you ever seen our captain
talking to a lady?

378
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,200
No, but I'm willing to wager
what his first words will be.

379
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,363
- The exact words?
- Aye.

380
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,531
- How much?
- A guinea.

381
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,871
- Done.
- What are they?

382
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,956
Estobar Entenza, <i>capitan</i>
in his most Catholic Majesty's Navy.

383
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,727
<i>Capitan</i> Hornblower?

384
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,895
Oh, thank heaven
we have found you in time.

385
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,598
You might have fallen afoul
of our warship <i>Natividad...</i>

386
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,835
...before I could bring you
the wonderful news.

387
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,305
- News?
- Captain Hornblower...

388
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,779
...I welcome you
as the new ally of Spain.

389
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,113
That's done it.

390
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:40,189
For a month, your country and mine have
been brothers-in-arms against Napoleon.

391
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,021
Together, with God's help,
we shall destroy him.

392
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,360
Oh, perhaps you think
it is too good to be true.

393
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,098
Here is a letter from your Admiralty.

394
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,629
Thank you.

395
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,906
Excuse me. Mr. Bush.

396
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,805
- Bring the prisoners here.
- Aye, aye, sir.

397
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,881
Last month,
Napoleon kidnapped our king...

398
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,348
...and put his own brother
on the throne of Spain.

399
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,680
Our government in exile
immediately concluded...

400
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,948
...an alliance with His Britannic Majesty.

401
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,356
You understand now my fear that you
might have encountered the <i>Natividad.</i>

402
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,759
Her <i>capitan</i> also is ignorant
of the new alliance.

403
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,297
It happened, sir...

404
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,597
...that last week
we did encounter the <i>Natividad.</i>

405
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,170
You were wise to show your heels, <i>capitan.</i>
She is twice your strength.

406
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,574
Imagine what would have happened.

407
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,245
We captured the <i>Natividad,</i> senor.

408
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,684
Impossible!

409
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,517
Captain, you are... You are joking.

410
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,489
I've never been more serious in my life.

411
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,105
- Where is the captain?
- Over there.

412
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:17,015
Captain Hornblower?

413
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,538
My name is Wellesley,
Lady Barbara Wellesley.

414
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,532
Wellesley?

415
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,038
You're not related
to the Duke of Wellington?

416
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,968
- He's my brother.
- Oh, but...

417
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,781
- A Spanish lugger?
- There's yellow fever in Panama.

418
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,579
And when Capt. Entenza set out
in search of you, he was good enough to...

419
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:59,823
- What the devil is that, Mr. Longley?
- I'm not quite sure, sir.

420
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,529
Forgive me, captain,
but I was about to tell you...

421
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,101
...that I require passage to England
for myself and my maid.

422
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,806
Not in the <i>Lydia?</i>

423
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,701
What other British ship
is in these waters, sir?

424
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,777
Do you suggest that we swim home?

425
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,105
I suggest that Your Ladyship
cross the Isthmus of Panama...

426
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:23,549
...and embark on a ship which has frills
and fancies enough for women passengers.

427
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,054
A thousand people died
in Panama this week.

428
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,959
May I ask why you were in Panama
in the first place?

429
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,528
Because, sir,
the British packet I was sailing in...

430
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,688
...was captured months ago
by the Spaniards.

431
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,731
I was their prisoner until the alliance.

432
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,666
I must say, I was treated
by the enemy with more courtesy...

433
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,274
...than I've received so far from
the captain of His Majesty's ship <i>Lydia.</i>

434
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,376
- Exactly.
- Oh, <i>capitan, capitan,</i> it cannot be true.

435
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,449
You gave the <i>Natividad</i>
to the rebel Don Julian?

436
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,676
But a week ago
you were already our ally.

437
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,378
Santa Maria, do you realize
what you have done?

438
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:02,185
We have no ship in the Pacific!
They'll burn our ports, sack all our cities!

439
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,421
I am well aware of the situation.

440
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,656
This removes any possibility
of Your Ladyship's remaining aboard.

441
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,061
Indeed.

442
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:12,634
We're on our way to fight
a ship twice our strength.

443
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,772
If we're defeated, you'll be in the hands
of a butchering maniac.

444
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,738
If I return to Panama,
I'll probably die of the fever.

445
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,673
And since there's a good chance of death
in either case...

446
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,644
...I must insist
upon making the choice myself.

447
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,750
Longley! If I am to overtake <i>Natividad,</i>
I must ask you to leave at once. Adios.

448
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,912
Mr. Bush, see these gentlemen
over the side.

449
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,684
Mr. Longley, Lady Wellesley
will be moving into my cabin.

450
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,953
Be a little crowded, sir.

451
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,389
Clear my things into Mr. Bush's cabin.
Move his into the wardroom.

452
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,659
If Your Ladyship
will accompany Mr. Longley...

453
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,235
...perhaps you'll come
to regret your insistence.

454
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,940
Get that boat underway! Man the braces!

455
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,885
I hope I'm not disturbing the ship's routine,
Mr. Longley.

456
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,522
Oh, no. Not in the least, ma'am.

457
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,817
I'm afraid Captain Hornblower
thinks otherwise.

458
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,756
He's got a lot of his mind, ma'am.

459
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,863
If he doesn't retake the <i>Natividad,</i>
he's in for serious trouble.

460
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,558
Surely it isn't his fault
that Spain changed sides in the war.

461
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,260
I'm afraid the Admiralty
won't stop to consider that.

462
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,573
- You're fond of the captain, aren't you?
- Fond, ma'am?

463
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,470
He's the best officer in the service.

464
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,771
He's a better sailor than Mr. Bush,
a better gunner than Mr. Gerard.

465
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:32,074
When it comes to navigation,
Mr. Crystal doesn't hold a candle to him.

466
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,047
That's not all. He's as gentle
and warm-hearted as any man...

467
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,848
...who's ever sailed for the king.
- Mr. Longley!

468
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,459
Gentle and warm-hearted?
I see what you mean.

469
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,461
- Polwheal!
- Excuse me, ma'am.

470
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,861
Mr. Bush, I'll have you remind everyone
that this is still a ship of war!

471
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,468
- Clear away!
- Aye, aye, sir.

472
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,996
You are so big and so strong.

473
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:23,998
- Yes, surely. Feel that.
- Here.

474
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,036
- Oh, you got nothing there.
- Just get ahold of that now.

475
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,730
- Now, let's see what you got.
- No!

476
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,967
Come out of there! I'll eat you alive!

477
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,236
Mr. Bush!

478
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,282
Mr. Bush, we are not
on a pleasure cruise.

479
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:45,787
Our lives and our passengers' lives depend
upon this ship being properly handled.

480
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,322
The men seem to have their minds
on other things.

481
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,689
You will inform Her Ladyship
that she and her maid will remain below.

482
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,193
Aye, aye, sir.

483
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:57,027
May I wish you the best of fortune
in what lies ahead.

484
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,726
- Thank you.
- It is the captain's wish, Your Ladyship...

485
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,304
...that from now on,
you and your maid remain below.

486
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,673
Can two women really be so distracting,
captain?

487
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,009
May I remind you, ma'am, that my men...

488
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,343
...have been continually at sea
for eight months?

489
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,881
Oh, captain.

490
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:21,157
And how long have you been at sea?

491
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,664
Sail! Off the larboard bow!

492
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:44,610
Mr. Longley, conduct Lady Barbara
and her maid to the cable tier.

493
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,910
- They'll remain there until the action is over.
- Aye, aye, sir.

494
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,849
Captain's ordered you
to the cable tier, ma'am.

495
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,980
The cable tier? And what if I refuse?

496
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,389
I shall have to carry you, ma'am.

497
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,621
Orders, ma'am.
You'd get me shot if you didn't.

498
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,665
I shouldn't want to do that, Mr. Longley.

499
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,101
Man the braces there!

500
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,140
Port your helm. Keep her as close
near the wind as she'll lie.

501
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,537
Aye, aye, sir.

502
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,271
Mr. Bush, beat to quarters
and clear for action!

503
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,936
He'll have quite a shock, sir...

504
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:47,509
...when he gets his 23-gun
salute broadside.

505
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,084
I'm afraid not, Mr. Bush.

506
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,783
It looks as though Don Julian
has heard the news too.

507
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,985
Our chance to surprise him is gone.

508
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,719
She's got twice our guns
and twice our men.

509
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:40,057
We can't stand off and pound her
and we can't go in and board her.

510
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,722
All we can do is outsail her
and hit when she can't hit back.

511
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,496
I'm not worried.
Not with Captain Hornblower.

512
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,830
He's crowded on every rag she'll carry.
Look at her heel, sir.

513
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:55,501
- Her gun ports are under water.
- That's what we've been waiting for.

514
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,341
- Starboard battery, ready!
- Starboard battery, ready!

515
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,248
Helm the weather!

516
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,098
- Fire as your guns bear!
- Fire as your guns bear!

517
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,277
Ease your helm!

518
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,283
Mr. Harrison, the helm's a lee!

519
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,526
Head and foresheets, let go!

520
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,165
- I thought we were going across her bow!
- So do they.

521
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,925
Hornblower fooled them and me too.

522
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,569
- Check your foresheets!
- Starboard battery, reload!

523
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,254
Port battery, fire as your guns bear!

524
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,893
- Port battery, reload.
- Well done.

525
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,639
That's one in the beezer, one in the belly
and nothing back from him.

526
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,855
Hornblower's amazing.

527
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,460
Two broadsides into her
without a round back.

528
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,425
Now we've a chance
in a pounding match.

529
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,033
But there'll be no fooling her a third time,
I'm thinking. Here she comes.

530
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,795
For what we are about to receive,
may we all be truly thankful.

531
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,905
Stand by on the quarterdeck!

532
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,383
- Two starboard guns out of action.
- Report to Mr. Gerard.

533
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,118
Aye, aye, sir.
Two starboard guns out of action.

534
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,626
- Where?
- The fo'c's'le.

535
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,336
Quist, look out!

536
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,508
Do you hear that?
He knew my name. He knew my name.

537
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,238
Chop that rigging away.

538
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,915
I'm all right, sir.

539
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,255
Of course you are, sonny.
Of course you are.

540
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,421
Quist, take him below.

541
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,069
Run up a new set of colors!

542
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:50,540
- Blast her as she goes by, Mr. Gerard.
- Aye, aye, sir. Port battery, ready!

543
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,482
Fire!

544
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:34,848
Get those guns back into action!
Get those guns back into action!

545
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:38,426
Get these wounded below!
Clear this wreckage away!

546
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,459
That's it, men,
get that wreckage overboard.

547
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,262
Fire!

548
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:22,297
Give me a hand here, men.
Get this stuff off of him.

549
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,179
McCrea, over here, the captain.

550
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,283
- Are you all right, sir?
- See to your duties, Mr. Bush. I'm all right.

551
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,291
- What are you doing on deck?
- The surgeon's been killed, sir.

552
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,328
- Who's with the wounded?
- Her Ladyship.

553
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,159
- What?
- She insisted on helping, sir.

554
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,233
- There's so many, sir.
- She's down there?

555
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,269
No stopping her. Put on a bosun's jacket
and went to work.

556
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,437
- Well, go below, man, and help her.
- Aye, aye, sir.

557
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:11,115
Stand by to go about. Have every gun
ready to fire when we cross her.

558
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,722
Aye, aye, sir. Stand by to go about!

559
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,053
- Hard alee!
- Aye, aye, sir.

560
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,690
Port battery, ready!

561
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,879
We're in range. Ready!

562
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:41,548
Steady there! A keg of rum
if you get the foremast!

563
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:08,099
- Hard astarboard.
- Shift over the headsheets!

564
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,590
Cease fire!

565
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,915
Our mission in the Pacific is finished,
gentlemen.

566
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,151
Thank you for the way
you've all carried out your duties.

567
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,524
Your conduct today will be brought
to the attention of the Admiralty.

568
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:36,632
- What course shall I set, sir?
- Course?

569
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,594
- South, Mr. Crystal.
- Very good, sir.

570
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:48,004
Mr. Gerard, I told you to clear the decks
for action in 10 minutes.

571
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,373
You did it in eight.

572
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,551
Bosun, double ration of rum all around.

573
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:01,520
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Well done, well done.

574
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:06,328
- Well, Quist, there goes your prize money.
- It's all right, sir.

575
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,329
You'll find us another one.
It's a big ocean.

576
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:38,559
I came back to you, Mother, didn't I?

577
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,230
I promised you I'd come back.

578
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,897
Yes, dear, you've come back to me.

579
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,161
Did you miss me?

580
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,271
Oh, yes. Yes, my own.

581
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,180
Kiss me the way you used to, Mother...

582
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,781
...when I was very little.

583
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,214
Couldn't you?

584
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,050
Just once?

585
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,195
If I only knew how.

586
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,859
On his eyes and on his mouth,
Your Ladyship.

587
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,541
That's right, Mother.

588
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,117
Good night.

589
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:56,635
How did you know?

590
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:01,502
It was the way she said goodbye to him
at Plymouth.

591
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,212
As though she was kissing him
good night.

592
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,277
And she was.

593
00:59:10,526 --> 00:59:14,462
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Good afternoon, captain.

594
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,257
I haven't had an opportunity yet...

595
00:59:16,432 --> 00:59:18,923
...to thank you for everything
you did for the men.

596
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:25,066
- Have you a chill, Your Ladyship?
- It's just the strain of the past two weeks.

597
00:59:25,241 --> 00:59:30,338
Well, I don't wonder. What you saw
was never meant for woman's eyes.

598
00:59:30,846 --> 00:59:32,973
But I did see, captain.

599
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:36,016
And I know there's not another officer
in the king's service...

600
00:59:36,185 --> 00:59:39,245
...who could've done
what you've done on this voyage.

601
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:41,923
I'm glad you think so, Your Ladyship.

602
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:46,084
- All England will think so.
- Thank you, ma'am.

603
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,528
Your Ladyship.

604
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:59,373
Mr. Bush. Mr. Gerard.
Her Ladyship is ill. Give me a hand.

605
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:09,182
- It is the fever! The fever!
- Make sense, girl.

606
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:12,548
Milady, she has the yellow fever
from Panama.

607
01:00:12,721 --> 01:00:14,279
We will all die.

608
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:18,018
Oh, I have seen
how it strikes down whole cities.

609
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:22,955
Sentry, keep her quiet. Allow nobody
aft of her without my orders.

610
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,312
And our surgeon dead.

611
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,709
Bring me the medical books
from the sick bay.

612
01:00:43,886 --> 01:00:45,353
And some more blankets.

613
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:47,546
Just put them inside the door.
Don't come in.

614
01:00:47,723 --> 01:00:50,692
If it's yellow fever,
this cabin will be quarantined.

615
01:01:27,296 --> 01:01:30,527
- I thought you might feel the need of this.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bush.

616
01:01:30,699 --> 01:01:34,226
- The books tell you anything, sir?
- Well, enough to give me some hope.

617
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:37,600
Swamp fever and yellow fever
have the same symptoms in the beginning.

618
01:01:37,773 --> 01:01:39,638
- When will you know?
- In 72 hours.

619
01:01:39,808 --> 01:01:42,800
If it's swamp fever,
her temperature will break.

620
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:45,705
If it's yellow <i>fever...</i>

621
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:12,197
Hebe.

622
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:19,868
Hebe.

623
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:40,286
Hebe?

624
01:03:43,232 --> 01:03:46,565
- Will you fetch Lady Barbara's maid, please?
- Aye, sir.

625
01:04:00,516 --> 01:04:03,144
Oh, Hebe, you may go in
to Lady Barbara now.

626
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:05,583
No, it's all right. The fever's broken.

627
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:07,483
Go in quickly.

628
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:14,753
I'm sure everybody'll be happy
about Lady Barbara's recovery, sir.

629
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:18,388
Myself included. It would've been
a black mark against this ship...

630
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:21,468
...if anything had happened
to the Duke of Wellington's sister.

631
01:04:21,637 --> 01:04:24,265
It wouldn't have set so well
with Mucho Pomposo either.

632
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,967
- Mucho Pomposo?
- Oh, a slip of the tongue.

633
01:04:28,143 --> 01:04:29,440
I meant Admiral Leighton.

634
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:32,273
Sir Rodney Leighton,
the man she's going to marry.

635
01:04:34,183 --> 01:04:38,677
As soon as she gets back to England,
according to Her Ladyship's servant.

636
01:04:41,957 --> 01:04:43,822
Will that be all, sir?

637
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,753
Oh, yes, that's all.
Thank you, Polwheal.

638
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,725
Good night, sir.

639
01:05:00,109 --> 01:05:02,100
Dear Hebe.

640
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:05,178
And to think I nearly left you in Panama.

641
01:05:05,347 --> 01:05:07,212
What would have happened
to me if I had?

642
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:12,252
Oh, milady, I did not help you.
I was afraid of the fever.

643
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:15,584
The whole time, only one was here.

644
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:25,391
The <i>capitan</i> was the only one.

645
01:05:30,272 --> 01:05:35,403
- How long was I ill, Hebe?
- Three day and three night, milady.

646
01:05:37,946 --> 01:05:40,107
He was the only one?

647
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:07,267
- Good morning, captain.
- Good morning.

648
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:09,274
I'm glad to see that you're better.

649
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:13,211
It's my good fortune that you're not
only a captain, but a doctor as well.

650
01:06:14,082 --> 01:06:16,812
I did no more than read a medical book,
Your Ladyship.

651
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:19,476
And go 72 hours without sleep.

652
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:21,885
That's not unusual for a sailor,
Your Ladyship.

653
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:25,784
I do wish you'd call me Lady Barbara
instead of Your Ladyship.

654
01:06:27,062 --> 01:06:29,496
Oh, certainly, Your Lady...

655
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:32,161
Lady Barbara.

656
01:06:32,434 --> 01:06:35,062
Of course, if Lady Barbara
doesn't come easily to you...

657
01:06:35,237 --> 01:06:39,196
...and you wish to attract my attention,
you can always say:

658
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:45,809
You see, captain,
I'm well enough to be rude.

659
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:47,846
Please forgive me.

660
01:06:48,116 --> 01:06:51,449
You're very observant.
No one's ever noticed that before.

661
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:53,611
Oh, I'm sure of that, captain.

662
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:57,922
Won't you sit down?

663
01:06:58,093 --> 01:07:00,789
Well, thank you, but I must
make an inspection of the ship.

664
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:02,828
We've a difficult voyage ahead.

665
01:07:03,265 --> 01:07:07,258
- When should we reach England, Captain?
- In the spring, Lady Barbara.

666
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,765
It should take as long as that?

667
01:07:10,606 --> 01:07:13,632
With fair winds
and all the canvas we can carry...

668
01:07:13,809 --> 01:07:18,644
...I think I can promise you that
we'll have you home before the first robin.

669
01:07:20,816 --> 01:07:23,182
Now you must excuse me,
Your Ladyship.

670
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:26,010
I mean, Lady Barbara.

671
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:52,098
How beautiful the stars are tonight.

672
01:08:52,274 --> 01:08:55,107
It's as though we were sailing
the heavens instead of the sea.

673
01:08:55,277 --> 01:09:00,476
Well, in a way, we are. We steer from
star to star rather than from land to land.

674
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:03,117
You never forget you're the captain
of a ship, do you?

675
01:09:03,285 --> 01:09:06,448
No, the ship's captain
cannot afford to forget.

676
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:09,386
On a night like this,
I can forget everything.

677
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:14,621
Who I am, where I come from,
where I'm going.

678
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:19,460
I only knew the <i>Lydia's</i>
sailing on and on in space.

679
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:24,299
There is no other world
and this voyage will never end.

680
01:09:30,812 --> 01:09:33,679
- How much?
- Five and a half, sir.

681
01:09:33,849 --> 01:09:36,841
Five and a half knots.
We're making a quick passage.

682
01:09:37,019 --> 01:09:41,012
Is that what you really want,
a quick passage?

683
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:44,157
Well, every captain wants that,
Lady Barbara.

684
01:09:48,463 --> 01:09:50,363
Well, it's getting late.

685
01:09:50,632 --> 01:09:53,795
There'll be a chill in the air.
These tropical nights are deceptive.

686
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:57,666
I don't want a quick passage.
I don't want this voyage to end.

687
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:03,800
- <i>Barbara...</i>
- How much longer are we going to pretend?

688
01:10:04,212 --> 01:10:08,911
You must know I love you.
Why do you fight against it?

689
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,217
I'm married, Lady Barbara.

690
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:25,098
Forgive me.

691
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:28,663
I've made a terrible mistake.

692
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:31,799
I'm deeply ashamed.

693
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:36,372
No, please. Stay here
and speed your ship homeward.

694
01:10:54,896 --> 01:10:59,128
Mr. Bush, we'll have more sail on her.
Reset your t'gallants.

695
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:02,031
But the wind is increasing.
I was about to reduce sail.

696
01:11:02,204 --> 01:11:05,435
- I gave you an order, Mr. Bush.
- Aye, aye, sir.

697
01:11:05,774 --> 01:11:08,641
Away aloft! Set the t'gallants!

698
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:12,777
And I thought I knew all his moods.
I've never seen him drive the ship so hard.

699
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:16,145
It's as if he wished
the <i>Lydia</i> would fly home.

700
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:26,984
Now.

701
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:30,992
Thirty-one.

702
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:35,599
Are we near land, Mr. Bush?

703
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:38,763
See those sea gulls, ma'am?
They sleep in England.

704
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,670
With any luck, we'll sight
Land's End tonight, ma'am.

705
01:11:41,843 --> 01:11:45,711
And if the weather holds,
Plymouth by morning.

706
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:49,177
You've been at sea a long time, ma'am.

707
01:11:49,384 --> 01:11:51,875
A lifetime, Mr. Bush.

708
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:43,560
- Oh, my love.
- Barbara. Barbara.

709
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:48,835
- I have no longing for the land.
- Nor I.

710
01:12:52,113 --> 01:12:57,050
I've known from the first, I think,
when you tried to make me leave the ship.

711
01:12:57,219 --> 01:13:00,154
All captain and no heart, I thought.

712
01:13:00,522 --> 01:13:04,356
Now every mile closer to England
is agony for me.

713
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:11,360
Oh, my dear. My sweet.

714
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:29,216
Land ho!

715
01:13:38,126 --> 01:13:39,423
What are we to do?

716
01:13:41,196 --> 01:13:42,527
Do?

717
01:13:44,499 --> 01:13:47,491
We are lovers and the world is ours.

718
01:13:49,537 --> 01:13:53,166
- But...
- Hebe is safe.

719
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,901
She wouldn't be indiscreet.

720
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,311
But we're not free...

721
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:03,280
...either of us.

722
01:14:12,193 --> 01:14:14,525
You really believe it can end here?

723
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:17,695
In this one moment?

724
01:14:21,336 --> 01:14:22,963
I see.

725
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:28,007
It isn't easy for me to say.

726
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:30,572
Please try to understand.

727
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:51,359
Admiral's barge heading our way.

728
01:14:54,803 --> 01:14:56,430
Hoist the storm warnings.

729
01:14:56,638 --> 01:14:59,129
- It's Mucho Pomposo himself.
- Who?

730
01:14:59,307 --> 01:15:03,437
Sir Rodney Leighton, Knight of the Bath,
Knight of the Tower and Sword of Portugal.

731
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:07,172
For some extraordinary reason,
a rear admiral in His Majesty's Navy.

732
01:15:07,349 --> 01:15:09,647
Come to claim his lady.

733
01:15:10,185 --> 01:15:11,618
Pipe the side!

734
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,892
Captain Hornblower at your service, sir.

735
01:15:19,461 --> 01:15:22,521
Lady Barbara Wellesley is aboard,
is she not?

736
01:15:22,864 --> 01:15:25,458
She's been informed of your arrival, sir.

737
01:15:25,967 --> 01:15:29,061
Your exploits at sea, captain,
have made you quite famous.

738
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:32,331
When you make your report
to the Admiralty you'll probably find...

739
01:15:32,507 --> 01:15:35,408
...that you've something better
to command than this 38-gunner.

740
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:36,839
I did little to deserve it.

741
01:15:37,145 --> 01:15:39,272
It's my belief
that you were very fortunate...

742
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:44,111
...to sink the <i>Natividad,</i>
having first given her away as you did.

743
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:47,618
- On your own initiative.
- It seemed the best thing to do at the time.

744
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:51,623
The captain of a frigate
doesn't normally decide Admiralty policy.

745
01:15:51,793 --> 01:15:54,819
There was no way of consulting
the Admiralty, or I'd have done so.

746
01:15:54,996 --> 01:15:59,695
But, really, Hornblower, giving away
a 60-gun prize to a madman.

747
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:02,359
I stood ready to answer
for my action, sir.

748
01:16:02,537 --> 01:16:05,199
Had you been serving under me,
you'd have answered for it.

749
01:16:05,373 --> 01:16:09,139
A court martial might have considered
your action irresponsible.

750
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:12,404
It caused you to risk the life
of the Duke of Wellington's sister.

751
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:14,905
I apologize for that, sir.

752
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:18,211
It would have gone very hard with you
had anything happened to her.

753
01:16:18,686 --> 01:16:22,383
I, too, value Lady Barbara highly.
We're to be married.

754
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:24,989
Yes, so Lady Barbara has told me, sir.

755
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,560
I suppose a ship of this size
is rather confining...

756
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:31,893
...and confidences are likely to be freer
than under normal circumstances.

757
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:35,593
Here you are, at last, my dear.

758
01:16:36,237 --> 01:16:39,104
You've no idea how concerned I've been
for your welfare.

759
01:16:39,274 --> 01:16:40,502
That was sweet of you.

760
01:16:40,909 --> 01:16:43,605
Shall we go? Your family waits
impatiently in London.

761
01:16:43,778 --> 01:16:46,838
And after that, my family in Ireland.

762
01:16:56,891 --> 01:16:58,449
Goodbye, Captain Hornblower.

763
01:16:59,761 --> 01:17:02,855
Thank you for your kindness.

764
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:06,299
Goodbye, Lady Barbara.

765
01:17:18,046 --> 01:17:21,538
- Gentlemen.
- Goodbye, ma'am.

766
01:18:17,805 --> 01:18:19,432
Maria?

767
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:24,302
Maria.

768
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:28,314
Oh, sir. It's you at last.

769
01:18:28,483 --> 01:18:30,610
Mrs. McPhee. Where's my wife?

770
01:18:30,785 --> 01:18:35,154
If only you could've come home sooner,
captain, to be here in time.

771
01:18:35,557 --> 01:18:39,823
- What's happened?
- She's dead, sir.

772
01:18:39,994 --> 01:18:42,622
Died in childbed, giving you a son.

773
01:18:43,097 --> 01:18:48,034
She so wanted to live, sir,
at least until you returned.

774
01:18:52,473 --> 01:18:54,839
She left this for you, sir.

775
01:18:55,476 --> 01:18:58,240
It was on her deathbed she wrote it.

776
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:09,920
- Where is the child?
- In here, sir.

777
01:19:12,527 --> 01:19:15,928
He's a strong lad,
with a lusty voice when he's awake.

778
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:49,091
Fine boy.

779
01:20:04,279 --> 01:20:06,577
<i>My husband:</i>

780
01:20:06,748 --> 01:20:11,481
<i>Not knowing where you are,</i>
<i>I cannot send these last words to you...</i>

781
01:20:11,653 --> 01:20:14,850
<i>... but I pray you will come back</i>
<i>to read them.</i>

782
01:20:15,123 --> 01:20:19,560
<i>Do not forget me completely, Horatio,</i>
<i>when I'm gone.</i>

783
01:20:19,927 --> 01:20:22,691
<i>Though we've been married</i>
<i>for 15 years...</i>

784
01:20:22,864 --> 01:20:26,857
<i>... in all that time we were together</i>
<i>for only 15 months...</i>

785
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:30,698
<i>... one Christmas, two birthdays.</i>

786
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:33,705
<i>But I am not sorry for the years.</i>

787
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:37,367
<i>I know you have not loved me deeply,</i>
<i>Horatio.</i>

788
01:20:37,545 --> 01:20:42,244
<i>But I have loved you more</i>
<i>for never betraying it to me.</i>

789
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:45,647
<i>I know it was because</i>
<i>you are sorry for me.</i>

790
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:49,551
<i>And because a sailor</i>
<i>needed someone to come home to.</i>

791
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:54,625
<i>And I pray now</i>
<i>you will come home to our son.</i>

792
01:20:55,363 --> 01:20:59,527
<i>Your loving wife, Maria.</i>

793
01:21:08,576 --> 01:21:11,670
You shouldn't be here in the dark
like this, sir.

794
01:21:11,846 --> 01:21:15,338
And I'm beginning to think you don't like
my cooking as much as ship's food.

795
01:21:15,516 --> 01:21:18,610
Two weeks now, and you've done
no more than nibble at it.

796
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:23,081
This'll cheer you up.
It's about the lady you brought...

797
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:26,988
...from the other side of the world.
A bonnie wedding it must've been.

798
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:52,545
By special messenger, sir,
from the Admiralty.

799
01:21:54,322 --> 01:21:57,257
I hope it's not to be the sea again, sir.

800
01:22:00,895 --> 01:22:05,923
- I'll be leaving for London in the morning.
- You've had so little time with the lad.

801
01:22:13,641 --> 01:22:17,236
Dashed if that report of yours didn't read
like a novel. Couldn't put it down.

802
01:22:17,412 --> 01:22:18,777
- Thank you.
- You know everyone?

803
01:22:18,946 --> 01:22:21,779
Leighton, Elliott, Bolton, Macartney.
You know enough of them.

804
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:24,176
It's a pleasure to see you again, sir.

805
01:22:24,352 --> 01:22:27,014
You've changed since you were
one of my midshipmen.

806
01:22:27,188 --> 01:22:30,157
- Quite a fellow with the girls, eh?
- I beg your pardon, sir?

807
01:22:30,324 --> 01:22:34,693
Come, come. Six months at sea
with a flower of the English nobility.

808
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:37,353
Don't tell me it wasn't a trifle gay, what?

809
01:22:37,532 --> 01:22:38,863
What? What?

810
01:22:39,033 --> 01:22:42,696
Well, Hornblower, after that cruise,
you may not find it so exciting...

811
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,395
...commanding a ship of the line.
- A ship of the line?

812
01:22:45,573 --> 01:22:48,872
We're giving you a 74. A Frenchman
we captured, renamed the <i>Sutherland.</i>

813
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:52,308
- The <i>Lydia's</i> crew will be transferred to her.
- I'm extremely grateful.

814
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,573
You'll be attached
to Leighton's squadron.

815
01:22:56,684 --> 01:23:00,450
And now, gentlemen,
the confounded war.

816
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:05,188
I think Napoleon has bitten off more
than he can chew in the Spanish peninsula.

817
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:07,759
The Duke of Wellington
has a chance to defeat him...

818
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:11,626
...and bring victory to England,
if we can maintain our naval blockade.

819
01:23:11,799 --> 01:23:14,632
But not a single French ship must sail.
That's up to you.

820
01:23:14,802 --> 01:23:18,397
Now, if you look at this map,
Macartney'll be <i>here...</i>

821
01:23:24,812 --> 01:23:26,541
Captain Hornblower.

822
01:23:30,117 --> 01:23:31,709
Barbara.

823
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:39,191
I hoped we would meet.

824
01:23:40,328 --> 01:23:44,264
I wanted to tell you how sorry I was
about the news you had at home.

825
01:23:44,432 --> 01:23:45,865
Well, thank you.

826
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:50,964
I would have written, but I only heard
upon my return from Ireland.

827
01:23:52,139 --> 01:23:56,166
- After the ceremony.
- Yes, of course, Lady Barbara.

828
01:23:58,713 --> 01:24:00,271
I hear you have a son.

829
01:24:01,649 --> 01:24:05,483
Yes. He's a boy to be proud of.

830
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,120
I'm sure he is.

831
01:24:13,561 --> 01:24:16,029
Well, I must take my leave now.

832
01:24:16,497 --> 01:24:18,795
I wish you every happiness.

833
01:24:19,367 --> 01:24:20,891
Thank you.

834
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:28,374
Goodbye, Horatio.

835
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:31,444
Goodbye, Barbara.

836
01:24:57,438 --> 01:24:59,998
Signal from the flagship, sir.
All captains come aboard.

837
01:25:00,174 --> 01:25:02,972
Oh, very good, Mr. Bush.
Acknowledge, and clear away the gig.

838
01:25:03,144 --> 01:25:06,875
Acknowledge!
Clear away the captain's gig!

839
01:25:09,617 --> 01:25:12,745
Clear away the yard and stay tackles!

840
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:17,122
Brace around the foremain yard!

841
01:25:22,964 --> 01:25:25,558
Well, gentlemen,
now that we are finally all assembled...

842
01:25:25,733 --> 01:25:28,930
...l've some fairly startling news
that has been sent to me by cutter.

843
01:25:29,103 --> 01:25:31,765
The French have broken
Macartney's blockade at Brest.

844
01:25:33,107 --> 01:25:36,508
The old boy supposedly had Napoleon's
ships completely bottled up in here.

845
01:25:36,677 --> 01:25:38,736
A pea-soup fog settled in for 48 hours.

846
01:25:38,913 --> 01:25:42,872
- When it lifted, four ships had slipped away.
- Any idea what course they took?

847
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:45,883
The only place they could go
is to the Mediterranean.

848
01:25:46,053 --> 01:25:50,490
So if we proceed from our position here,
stand well out into the bay...

849
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:55,459
...we'll intercept them about here.
Four against four, the outcome's obvious.

850
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,521
You don't seem to agree,
Captain Hornblower.

851
01:25:58,699 --> 01:26:00,963
Where else would they go
except the Mediterranean?

852
01:26:01,135 --> 01:26:04,127
- I submit, sir, here.
- North of Spain?

853
01:26:04,305 --> 01:26:05,829
Nonsense. Why should they?

854
01:26:06,007 --> 01:26:08,737
Napoleon's army has already
been pushed deep into Spain...

855
01:26:08,909 --> 01:26:10,240
...by the Duke of Wellington.

856
01:26:10,411 --> 01:26:12,675
If I were Napoleon,
I'd consider it a good idea...

857
01:26:12,847 --> 01:26:15,247
...to thrust from the northeast,
behind the duke.

858
01:26:15,416 --> 01:26:16,713
And supply them by sea?

859
01:26:16,884 --> 01:26:19,182
Better than hauling over
the Pyrenees, I'd say.

860
01:26:19,353 --> 01:26:21,821
The French wouldn't risk four ships
on such a gamble.

861
01:26:21,989 --> 01:26:23,752
What does Napoleon care about ships...

862
01:26:23,924 --> 01:26:26,154
...except to help him
in his military operations?

863
01:26:26,327 --> 01:26:29,194
I submit most urgently
that instead of standing out to sea...

864
01:26:29,363 --> 01:26:31,297
...we move north along the French coast.

865
01:26:31,465 --> 01:26:34,798
Be the devil to pay with the Admiralty
if they got to the Mediterranean.

866
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:36,869
Be the devil to pay with the duke
otherwise.

867
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:40,303
Perhaps we could take care of both
possibilities with a wide deployment.

868
01:26:40,474 --> 01:26:43,034
Three of us fanning out from here,
and one ship inshore.

869
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:46,805
Good idea, Sylvester. You see,
I've no objection to a practical suggestion.

870
01:26:46,981 --> 01:26:49,381
I welcome it, in fact.
We've a war to win.

871
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:51,211
Very well then, who goes inshore?

872
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:53,780
Which of our ships
has the shallowest draught?

873
01:26:53,954 --> 01:26:56,684
The <i>Sutherland,</i> sir. French built.

874
01:26:56,857 --> 01:26:59,951
Oh, I see now what was influencing you,
Hornblower.

875
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:03,153
The prospect of picking up
a prize or two, eh?

876
01:27:03,497 --> 01:27:06,762
- Not at all, sir.
- Well, I'll make sure of that.

877
01:27:06,934 --> 01:27:09,926
I know how you enjoy
acting on your own initiative.

878
01:27:10,104 --> 01:27:13,801
I'm ordering you not to risk your ship
in any way for any reason.

879
01:27:13,974 --> 01:27:15,305
I want nothing crackbrained.

880
01:27:15,776 --> 01:27:17,767
If you sight the enemy,
bring me the news...

881
01:27:17,945 --> 01:27:20,277
...and we'll destroy them together,
is that clear?

882
01:27:20,448 --> 01:27:22,245
Perfectly clear, sir.

883
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:26,579
Just the same, put it in writing, Rogers.

884
01:27:37,665 --> 01:27:42,068
Sail off the larboard bow!

885
01:27:43,704 --> 01:27:47,834
That's queer, sir. It's a French brig,
but she's not running away.

886
01:27:48,576 --> 01:27:51,909
- Standby guns crew.
- Standby guns crew!

887
01:27:52,413 --> 01:27:54,608
She can't have see our flag yet.

888
01:27:55,049 --> 01:27:56,380
She's signaling.

889
01:27:57,885 --> 01:27:59,648
M.V.

890
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:02,789
We can't blame her for thinking
we're French. We're French built.

891
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:04,914
M.V. Is not in the code, sir.

892
01:28:05,092 --> 01:28:09,028
She'll start running fast enough
if we can't give her a conventional signal.

893
01:28:09,196 --> 01:28:11,994
- Port your helm!
- Aye, aye, sir.

894
01:28:12,366 --> 01:28:14,027
You're right, sir, there she goes.

895
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:16,601
- Put one across her bow, Mr. Gerard.
- Aye, aye, sir.

896
01:28:16,771 --> 01:28:20,002
Muzzle right point. Steady.

897
01:28:20,941 --> 01:28:22,408
Fire!

898
01:28:25,379 --> 01:28:29,008
Good shot, Mr. Gerard.
Any closer, and you'd have sunk her.

899
01:28:29,383 --> 01:28:32,750
- She's lowering her flag, sir.
- Take your boat and board her, Mr. Bush.

900
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,047
Bring her in.
I'd like a word with her captain.

901
01:28:35,222 --> 01:28:37,156
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Bring her into the wind!

902
01:28:37,324 --> 01:28:40,521
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Make the boat ready!

903
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:43,855
Not another British ship in sight.

904
01:28:44,031 --> 01:28:47,057
That means, we'll have to take
all the prize money.

905
01:28:50,404 --> 01:28:52,736
Off with the cap, Alfonse.

906
01:28:55,376 --> 01:28:58,402
Merchant brig <i>Marie Louise,</i> sir.
Captain doesn't <i>comprend</i> English.

907
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:09,289
He doesn't seem to understand
French either, Mr. Bush.

908
01:29:09,456 --> 01:29:11,583
Shall I flog it out of him, sir?

909
01:29:11,759 --> 01:29:13,659
No, I don't consort brutality, Mr. Bush.

910
01:29:13,828 --> 01:29:16,126
Just take him up on deck,
chop off his head...

911
01:29:16,297 --> 01:29:17,821
...and give his body to the cook.

912
01:29:17,998 --> 01:29:21,957
No, no, <i>capitan,</i> no. I am only a poor man.
I care not about Napoleon.

913
01:29:22,703 --> 01:29:25,467
- I'll tell you what you want to know.
- That's better.

914
01:29:25,639 --> 01:29:28,540
Now that we've overcome
the barrier of language...

915
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:31,075
...once again,
what does this signal M.V. Mean?

916
01:29:32,813 --> 01:29:36,613
- It is French recognition signal, <i>capitan.</i>
- Thank you.

917
01:29:36,784 --> 01:29:40,515
That may be very useful, Mr. Bush.
Put the captain in the cable tier.

918
01:29:40,688 --> 01:29:42,952
Tell off a prize crew
to sail the brig to England.

919
01:29:43,123 --> 01:29:45,455
Brig and cargo ought to be worth
2000 pounds, sir.

920
01:29:45,626 --> 01:29:47,526
Come along, Alfonse.

921
01:29:48,629 --> 01:29:50,790
Just a minute, Mr. Bush.

922
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:54,500
What is the cargo?

923
01:29:54,668 --> 01:29:58,195
Forty tons of powder, 100 casks of beef
and 1000 bushels of oats, sir.

924
01:29:58,672 --> 01:30:00,537
A thousand bushels...?

925
01:30:01,408 --> 01:30:03,968
- Do you know what that means?
- A lot of horses, I'd say.

926
01:30:04,144 --> 01:30:08,137
Correct. And horses mean cavalry,
and cavalry means a land engagement.

927
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:10,408
Where were you bound for?

928
01:30:10,584 --> 01:30:13,348
Come on, man, or I'll guillotine you
here and now.

929
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,920
- Where were you bound for?
- La Teste, captain.

930
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:17,921
La Teste.

931
01:30:19,193 --> 01:30:21,388
There's no army near La Teste,
is there?

932
01:30:21,562 --> 01:30:25,054
You were transferring your cargo
to four French ships of the line?

933
01:30:25,232 --> 01:30:29,168
The ones that escaped from Brest?
For an attack on Wellington and Spain.

934
01:30:30,104 --> 01:30:33,835
I knew it. Sentry, take this man
down to the cable tier.

935
01:30:34,008 --> 01:30:37,341
Mr. Bush, cram on all sail
and set a course for La Teste.

936
01:30:37,511 --> 01:30:39,411
You're going
without advising the admiral?

937
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:43,038
We've no time. I'd rather be court-martialed
than let those ships get away.

938
01:30:43,217 --> 01:30:45,208
Send the French brig
to look for Leighton.

939
01:30:45,386 --> 01:30:47,650
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and Mr. Bush...

940
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:50,517
...pass the word to the sailmaker
to make me a French flag.

941
01:30:50,691 --> 01:30:52,158
Aye, aye, sir.

942
01:31:12,613 --> 01:31:15,741
- Let's hope that fools them, sir.
- We'll know soon enough, Mr. Bush.

943
01:31:15,916 --> 01:31:19,044
Clear for action, but keep
the gun ports shut and crew out of sight.

944
01:31:19,219 --> 01:31:22,052
- Aye, aye, sir. Beat to quarters.
- Beat to quarters!

945
01:31:27,528 --> 01:31:30,122
Stand by on the quarterdeck!

946
01:32:04,131 --> 01:32:05,826
Mr. Bush.

947
01:32:06,467 --> 01:32:08,697
There is a magnificent sight.

948
01:32:08,869 --> 01:32:14,307
Mr. Gerard, we'll load with chain shot.
I want those four Frenchmen dismasted.

949
01:32:15,409 --> 01:32:17,172
Aye, aye, sir.

950
01:32:41,869 --> 01:32:43,564
Hoist M.V.

951
01:33:05,192 --> 01:33:08,559
That fooled them, sir.
I really believe they're pleased to see us.

952
01:33:08,729 --> 01:33:11,027
Might be somewhat different
on the way back.

953
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:13,325
Especially with the wind dropping away.

954
01:33:17,704 --> 01:33:21,037
We'll close to point-blank range
and take them in succession, Mr. Bush.

955
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:22,675
Aye, aye, sir.

956
01:33:24,711 --> 01:33:28,511
Now, strike that French flag
and send up our own!

957
01:33:40,227 --> 01:33:43,219
At her rigging. Fire as you bear!

958
01:33:43,597 --> 01:33:45,963
Fire as your guns bear!

959
01:34:13,827 --> 01:34:15,454
Fire!

960
01:34:25,105 --> 01:34:27,471
- Fire to starboard. Wear ship!
- Aye, aye, sir.

961
01:34:35,349 --> 01:34:38,807
We'll give her another broadside.
For luck, lads!

962
01:34:46,894 --> 01:34:49,294
- Port, you helm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

963
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:52,090
Bring up the spinnaker.

964
01:35:12,452 --> 01:35:15,615
- Bring her as close as she'll take.
- Aye, aye, sir.

965
01:35:18,258 --> 01:35:20,283
Fire when ready, Mr. Bush!

966
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,690
Fire when ready!

967
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:26,063
Broadside, fire!

968
01:35:42,349 --> 01:35:45,876
Get this gun back into action.
Get the wounded below.

969
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:49,386
Fire as your guns bear!

970
01:36:10,711 --> 01:36:13,271
Keep firing, men. Keep at it!

971
01:36:16,817 --> 01:36:19,183
Get back to your guns, men.

972
01:36:19,853 --> 01:36:22,287
Another broadside!

973
01:36:22,823 --> 01:36:25,656
Let them have another broadside!

974
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,061
Fire!

975
01:36:44,411 --> 01:36:49,371
Come on, get this off, you devils.
Get it off. Get it off.

976
01:36:51,985 --> 01:36:55,716
- Carter, bring me a length of line here.
- Aye, aye, sir.

977
01:36:57,824 --> 01:37:01,260
Well, we left them cold meat
for Leighton, sir.

978
01:37:01,962 --> 01:37:04,396
Six feet of water in the well, sir.
We're sinking.

979
01:37:04,564 --> 01:37:07,761
Then we'll sink her where it'll do
some good, in the main channel.

980
01:37:07,934 --> 01:37:11,426
Draper, Saunders, Derrick,
bring the wounded up from the cockpit.

981
01:37:11,605 --> 01:37:13,470
Tie them to anything that will float!

982
01:37:24,418 --> 01:37:28,684
Men, give a hand here with Mr. Bush.
Lash him well to a grating.

983
01:37:33,994 --> 01:37:36,690
Quist, give a hand here with this gun.

984
01:37:36,963 --> 01:37:40,364
Men, clear the deck. Pull it in.

985
01:37:43,403 --> 01:37:45,667
Scoot around forward.

986
01:37:47,641 --> 01:37:51,509
Quickly, men. We'll her sink here right here,
with a shot through her hull.

987
01:37:55,415 --> 01:37:57,610
That's right. Chuck it up.

988
01:38:01,988 --> 01:38:04,422
- Lf you don't mind, Mr. Quist.
- Aye, aye, sir.

989
01:38:04,591 --> 01:38:06,616
Stand by now.

990
01:38:09,396 --> 01:38:11,864
Over the side! Abandon ship!
Over you go!

991
01:38:22,309 --> 01:38:24,402
Fellas, give a hand!

992
01:38:28,515 --> 01:38:30,881
Come on, or you'll go down with her.

993
01:38:31,318 --> 01:38:33,752
Come along, boys. Overboard.

994
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:46,460
- Over the side, Quist.
- Aye, aye, sir.

995
01:39:49,729 --> 01:39:51,128
Look at the <i>Sutherland,</i> sir.

996
01:39:51,298 --> 01:39:54,995
They'll never get past her now.
They're like ships in a bottle.

997
01:39:55,168 --> 01:39:56,795
So it would seem, Quist.

998
01:40:25,632 --> 01:40:27,190
Men.

999
01:40:27,968 --> 01:40:31,734
Our squadron should be here
before nightfall. That means you'll be free.

1000
01:40:32,138 --> 01:40:36,131
Mr. Bush, you and I are to be taken to Paris
and tried as pirates.

1001
01:40:37,310 --> 01:40:41,041
Well, I expected to lose my leg, sir,
but not all the way up to the neck.

1002
01:40:41,214 --> 01:40:44,411
Pardon, sir, but Mr. Bush
didn't ought to travel far without care...

1003
01:40:44,584 --> 01:40:46,313
...not with that leg of his.

1004
01:40:46,486 --> 01:40:50,081
I'd like to look after him, if you don't
mind putting up with an old jailbird.

1005
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:54,124
Oh, I can't allow you to do that, Quist.
The wind is getting stronger every second.

1006
01:40:54,294 --> 01:40:56,592
You'll be on your way home
with the rest of them.

1007
01:40:56,763 --> 01:40:59,789
I respectfully submit,
you won't hardly find a way of stopping me.

1008
01:41:01,635 --> 01:41:03,432
Thank you, Quist.

1009
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:11,634
Well, I'll say goodbye to you now, men,
for myself and Mr. Bush.

1010
01:41:12,379 --> 01:41:15,075
It's not likely
that we'll ever see you again.

1011
01:41:16,216 --> 01:41:18,741
You know the England
that you fought for.

1012
01:41:19,452 --> 01:41:23,388
You know that you never need lose faith
in her final victory.

1013
01:41:25,058 --> 01:41:26,958
I want to thank you all...

1014
01:41:27,127 --> 01:41:31,086
...for the honor that you've bestowed on me
by fighting at my side.

1015
01:41:38,338 --> 01:41:39,965
What's all that yelling mean, sir?

1016
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:43,200
They've just sighted our squadron.
Good for Leighton!

1017
01:41:53,486 --> 01:41:57,320
Captain Hornblower,
you're leaving for Paris immediately.

1018
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,718
Inside, or you shall find your grave here.

1019
01:42:25,885 --> 01:42:28,911
You're about to lose your ships, colonel,
and the fort.

1020
01:42:29,089 --> 01:42:32,115
That is hardly likely
to endear you to the emperor.

1021
01:43:04,724 --> 01:43:06,715
How is it now, Bush?

1022
01:43:07,961 --> 01:43:10,327
It's not my leg that's worrying me, sir.

1023
01:43:10,497 --> 01:43:14,593
It's knowing that you won't even try
to make a break as long as I'm here.

1024
01:43:15,535 --> 01:43:19,096
- I'm afraid he's delirious, Quist.
- He's not, sir. He's talking sense.

1025
01:43:19,272 --> 01:43:23,641
If you get a chance, why don't you
have a go, sir? I'll stick with Mr. Bush.

1026
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:26,037
It's all or none of us.

1027
01:43:47,634 --> 01:43:50,694
- I'm afraid I dozed off. What was wrong?
- Something with the wheel.

1028
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:53,100
They didn't wanna get
their delicate hands dirty.

1029
01:43:53,273 --> 01:43:55,173
You all right, Bush?

1030
01:43:55,842 --> 01:43:59,175
I feel better than I have for days, sir.
I had a good sleep.

1031
01:43:59,345 --> 01:44:02,803
Just the same, sir, I think we ought
to keep a tight hold on him for a bit.

1032
01:44:02,982 --> 01:44:06,850
I made a terrible job of fixing that wheel,
sir. Ought to be flogged for it.

1033
01:44:28,408 --> 01:44:32,435
- What's he say, sir?
- The horses are loose.

1034
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:36,071
He sent three of the men after them.

1035
01:44:36,249 --> 01:44:38,012
Now's your chance, sir.

1036
01:44:39,319 --> 01:44:41,719
You two. Get out of the coach.

1037
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:49,789
Go. Pick up that wheel.

1038
01:45:25,165 --> 01:45:27,497
No. I'll slow you down, sir.
You get on without me.

1039
01:45:27,667 --> 01:45:31,103
- It'll be quicker this way, sir.
- Out this way.

1040
01:45:38,111 --> 01:45:41,672
- Does it hurt, Bush?
- Less every day, sir.

1041
01:45:48,721 --> 01:45:51,451
We'd stand a better chance
if we looked like the others.

1042
01:45:51,624 --> 01:45:53,592
So I borrowed these.

1043
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:55,427
Quist, you ought to get a medal.

1044
01:45:56,062 --> 01:45:58,553
A medal, sir?
I got the jail for that in Hampshire.

1045
01:46:00,133 --> 01:46:02,158
Now, don't tell me
you stopped to cook these.

1046
01:46:02,335 --> 01:46:04,701
A poacher I may have been, sir,
but a cook, never.

1047
01:46:04,871 --> 01:46:08,967
Those birds just sort of flew
out of the kitchen into me hands, sir.

1048
01:46:09,943 --> 01:46:11,570
Where would you say we are, sir?

1049
01:46:11,744 --> 01:46:14,372
Oh, this is probably a tributary
of the river Loire.

1050
01:46:14,547 --> 01:46:17,778
If we continue on, we should each
the port of Nantes, God willing.

1051
01:46:17,951 --> 01:46:20,351
- And after that, sir?
- Beyond Nantes is the sea.

1052
01:46:21,354 --> 01:46:22,946
And beyond that, England.

1053
01:46:23,122 --> 01:46:24,589
Oh, sink me, Portsmouth.

1054
01:46:24,757 --> 01:46:28,784
All in good time, gentlemen.
Meanwhile, remember, you're French.

1055
01:47:00,894 --> 01:47:04,762
- Look over at that dock.
- Why, it's the old <i>Witch of Endor,</i> sir.

1056
01:47:04,931 --> 01:47:07,832
She went aground on the French coast
during the october gales.

1057
01:47:08,001 --> 01:47:09,935
She looks seaworthy enough now,
though.

1058
01:47:11,037 --> 01:47:14,234
It'd take about 20 men to handle her,
I'm afraid.

1059
01:47:14,407 --> 01:47:17,069
Aye. This is one time I wish
we was octopuses.

1060
01:47:18,578 --> 01:47:21,604
Steady. Uniforms.

1061
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:38,157
Why, they're not Frenchmen.
They're Hollanders.

1062
01:47:38,331 --> 01:47:41,357
Dutch, sir.
They're still Napoleon's allies, though.

1063
01:47:41,534 --> 01:47:42,967
Right, Mr. Bush.

1064
01:47:43,136 --> 01:47:46,697
And as such,
they have access to all shipping.

1065
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:49,571
Set a course for that rowboat, Quist.

1066
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:52,578
We won't be French much longer, Quist.

1067
01:48:14,634 --> 01:48:16,795
What's all that about, sir?

1068
01:48:18,037 --> 01:48:20,733
Big Dutchman's giving a birthday party.

1069
01:48:22,575 --> 01:48:24,770
Let's join in.

1070
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:08,849
Only an anchor watch aboard, sir.

1071
01:49:09,422 --> 01:49:11,515
Two hands and a master's mate.

1072
01:49:19,165 --> 01:49:21,531
- What are they, sir?
- Convict labor.

1073
01:49:21,701 --> 01:49:26,604
Fair riles me to see human beings treated
that way, even if they are Napoleon's men.

1074
01:49:35,248 --> 01:49:38,274
I'd like to brain that sergeant
and throw him in the sea.

1075
01:49:39,685 --> 01:49:41,983
They're English prisoners, sir.

1076
01:49:44,023 --> 01:49:45,422
Let's go aboard.

1077
01:50:28,167 --> 01:50:31,102
I'll send the other two down here.
See that they're entertained.

1078
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:33,033
Aye, aye, sir.

1079
01:50:34,207 --> 01:50:37,074
Looks like fair weather, Mr. Bush.

1080
01:51:02,034 --> 01:51:03,262
What's up now, Alf?

1081
01:51:03,436 --> 01:51:06,269
Seems that the Dutchman wants us
to move the <i>Witch</i> downstream.

1082
01:51:06,439 --> 01:51:09,067
Might be the chance
of throwing the sergeant overboard.

1083
01:51:25,491 --> 01:51:27,823
You said you'd brain him
and throw him in the sea.

1084
01:51:27,994 --> 01:51:31,760
- What are you waiting for?
- Come on, lads, let's go.

1085
01:51:35,434 --> 01:51:37,299
Over the side with him. Over the side.

1086
01:51:47,246 --> 01:51:49,510
Put me down, you fools!
I'm from Hampshire.

1087
01:51:49,682 --> 01:51:51,479
Let go of me!

1088
01:51:51,651 --> 01:51:53,642
No, no, no. Not them.

1089
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:57,453
Cast off, Mr. Bush. Take the wheel,
Quist. Make sail, men.

1090
01:51:57,623 --> 01:51:59,215
We're on our way to England.

1091
01:52:05,164 --> 01:52:08,998
All right, lads. Come on, now.
Heave! Heave!

1092
01:52:09,602 --> 01:52:11,729
Heave! Heave!

1093
01:52:28,020 --> 01:52:31,512
- Heave! Heave!
- Drop the topsail!

1094
01:52:31,691 --> 01:52:33,659
Heave! Heave!

1095
01:52:35,194 --> 01:52:38,220
- Let the wind take her!
- Aye, aye, sir.

1096
01:53:06,359 --> 01:53:07,951
<i>The Witch of Endor?</i>

1097
01:53:08,194 --> 01:53:11,322
Captain Horatio Hornblower?
If your eyesight's good and I'm sober...

1098
01:53:11,497 --> 01:53:13,727
...there's a dead man approaching
in a lost ship.

1099
01:53:13,899 --> 01:53:17,630
Answer back the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> just
got in ahead of him. And sign it St. Peter.

1100
01:53:18,037 --> 01:53:21,302
It's the truth. It's the <i>Witch.</i>
I'd know that girl's beakhead anywhere.

1101
01:53:21,474 --> 01:53:23,499
Here, let's send a telegraph.

1102
01:53:40,393 --> 01:53:42,486
<i>Witch of Endor?</i> Hornblower?

1103
01:53:42,662 --> 01:53:45,563
- Is everyone in Plymouth drunk, Woodford?
- It's the <i>Witch,</i> sir.

1104
01:53:45,731 --> 01:53:47,995
And they've confirmed Hornblower
in private code.

1105
01:53:48,167 --> 01:53:52,228
Well, why are you standing about, man?
Meet him where he lands. Bring him here.

1106
01:53:52,538 --> 01:53:55,371
The news has gone around.
All Plymouth's wild with excitement.

1107
01:53:55,541 --> 01:53:59,204
Plymouth? If it really is Hornblower,
all England will go wild.

1108
01:54:00,079 --> 01:54:01,876
Prize crew.

1109
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:06,781
Goodbye, Quist.

1110
01:54:07,253 --> 01:54:10,017
- I hope we sail together again.
- Thank you kindly, sir.

1111
01:54:10,189 --> 01:54:12,282
Perhaps you'll come
and take a glass of ale...

1112
01:54:12,458 --> 01:54:16,258
...in the pub I'll buy with my prize money.
I'll call it the Hornblower Arms.

1113
01:54:16,762 --> 01:54:18,696
I'd be honored, Quist.

1114
01:54:18,864 --> 01:54:21,128
Goodbye, sir. God bless you both.

1115
01:54:22,301 --> 01:54:26,465
- Goodbye, men.
- Goodbye!

1116
01:54:58,804 --> 01:55:02,137
Gad, Hornblower, the only pleasure
I seem to get from life these days...

1117
01:55:02,308 --> 01:55:04,708
...is when you come home
from one of your adventures.

1118
01:55:04,877 --> 01:55:07,778
Thank you. May I call your attention
to the gallant behavior...

1119
01:55:07,947 --> 01:55:10,472
...of my first lieutenant, Mr. Bush?
- Indeed you may.

1120
01:55:10,649 --> 01:55:14,813
Mr. Bush, the greatest pleasure
of an admiral is to reward good conduct.

1121
01:55:14,987 --> 01:55:16,818
I'm promoting you to captain.

1122
01:55:16,989 --> 01:55:18,650
If Leighton knew you were alive...

1123
01:55:18,824 --> 01:55:21,520
...l'm sure he'd have recommended it
in his last report.

1124
01:55:22,695 --> 01:55:25,858
- His last report, sir?
- Of course, you couldn't have known.

1125
01:55:26,031 --> 01:55:28,932
He was killed at La Teste. Great loss.

1126
01:55:29,101 --> 01:55:32,935
We need all our admirals
if we're ever to finish this confounded war.

1127
01:55:33,105 --> 01:55:36,199
- Yes, my lord.
- Oh, yes. Nearly forgot.

1128
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:39,173
Hornblower,
you're to leave for London at once.

1129
01:55:39,345 --> 01:55:41,006
- Oh, I'm afraid I can't, sir.
- Can't?

1130
01:55:41,580 --> 01:55:44,549
Wouldn't be surprised
if there was a knighthood in it for you.

1131
01:55:45,484 --> 01:55:48,715
Thank you, my lord.
But I'd like to see my son first.

1132
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:52,724
In that case, you'd better be off.

1133
01:55:52,992 --> 01:55:54,653
Thank you, my lord.

1134
01:56:41,907 --> 01:56:43,898
[ENGLISH]
