- Something terrible's happened!
- Tsumura's disappeared!

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,800
It appears he's escaped!

15

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
What an odd incident.

18
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,120
For us, members of the Bizarro 
Enthusiast Club, it's a little intriguing.

19
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,320
This is no small thing -

20
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,240
it's a big deal, is what it is!

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Not to mention the 
members of our club

22
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,080
have a connection with Dr. Kano...

MODEL AGENCY
"MUTUAL ARTS CLUB"

24
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm after a model.

25
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
May I ask your name, or 
the name of your referral?

26
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
"I HEREBY REFER GHOSTMAN SAGAWA"
DR. SANSAKU KANO

27
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
I see - Dr. Kano referred you.
"I HEREBY REFER GHOSTMAN SAGAWA"
DR. SANSAKU KANO

28
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,280
I see - Dr. Kano referred you.

29
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,720
This will do fine.

30
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,680
But this "Ghostman"...

31
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,720
...this is your name?

32
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,040
Quite the strange pen name.

33
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,240
That's a very typical Dr. Kano referral.

34
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,280
- Will the model be for painting, or photography?
- Oil painting.

35
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,400
- From when?
- 2 hours, every day.

36
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,400
10 days, from today.

37
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,200
From today?

38
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
What's the address?

39
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,200
This way, please.

40
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,520
We have 6 models 
available for selection.

41
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,680
Keiko.

42
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,400
Yes.

43
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,800
There's something off about him.

44
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,080
I hope Keiko's alright.

45
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,040
What'll it be?

46
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Thank you very much.

47
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,280
What're you doing 
out here? Any news?

48
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,920
You got a big mouth 
for a broke reporter.

49
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,000
You didn't see an odd 
man over there, did you?

50
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
- An odd man?
- Like a ghost.

51
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,440
- How macabre!
- No clue.

52
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,920
I see. Let's head back.

53
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,960
- I'm ready, Manager.
- He's too strange!

54
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,800
- You must reconsider.
- But...

55
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,080
...it's been so long between jobs.

56
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,800
- Hello.
- Hello, there.

57
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,360
Mr. Kikuchi - don't you think Keiko 
should turn that man down?

58
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
He's terribly weird.

59
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,360
What's going on?

60
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,640
What do you think?

61
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
There was a man here 
that looked like a ghost--

62
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,560
Stop it!

63
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,480
I'm going.

64
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,000
They're decent terms, after all.

65
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
If I lose any more work...

66
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
...my whole family is done for!

67
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,720
The address was Nishi-Ogikubo, 
wasn't it, manager?

68
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,440
Keiko! Wait, Keiko!

69
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
What's with you?

70
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,720
- I can't say.
- What's that?

71
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,840
Listen, you're just getting worked up.

72
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,920
That's not it -

73
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,120
I just feel like it's got to with that 
crazed man from the paper...

74
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,440
That's a good one.

75
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,800
Sounds like you'd be perfect 
for the Bizarro club too, Osada.

76
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,480
Good for you.

77
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
That's not what I'm talking about.

78
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,000
What's with the long face, Osada?

79
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,360
Are you cold?

80
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
Drink this. It'll warm you up.

81
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,120
Once you've finished, 
take your clothes off.

82
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
This way.

83
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
What will you do?

84
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm feeling numb.

85
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,960
It's cleaning your blood.

86
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
My blood?

87
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,560
Are you going to kill me?

88
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't kill me!

89
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,040
Please don't...please!

90
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,480
My mother's very old...

91
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
...and my little brothers...
there's lots of them!

92
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,160
You're looking terribly 
troubled, young man.

93
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,400
Your editor angry at you for 
not getting any good scoops?

94
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,560
- Nothing like that.
- What's with the long face and quick retorts, then?

95
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,320
I'm bored.

96
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,040
Write this, then:

97
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,000
"GHOST MAN VISITS 
NUDE MODEL CLUB"

98
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,760
Good, right? I'd read that newspaper!

99
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,040
Quit joking around.

100
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,360
Wanna dance?

101
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,200
They say nudes aren't even enough 
to sell papers these days.

102
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,360
Oh, it's the Doctor!

103
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,400
Dr. Kano himself graces 
us with his presence!

104
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm sure you remember him, Mitsuko.

105
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,360
Shush.

106
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,120
Fewer girls here than usual. 
Someone off working?

107
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,360
Oh - that reminds me.

108
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
A strange man with 
your referral was here.

109
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,600
- My referral?
- That's right.

110
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,320
One "Ghostman Sagawa"...

111
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,280
Ghostman Sagawa?

112
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,960
Here.

113
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
Never seen it before.

114
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,080
What's wrong?

115
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,160
She'll be killed.

116
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Come now, you 
shouldn't joke about that!

117
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,400
That ghost man was Tsumura - 
he ran an art class for women!

118
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,280
11:00pm already, huh?

119
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
She's late.

120
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
Good evening.

121
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,000
Have you seen your sister, Kokichi?

122
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Nope.

123
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,000
I knew it.

124
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,400
What're you talking about? 
We don't know anything yet!

125
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,120
Did something 
happen to my sister?

126
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,200
Let's go and have a look, then!

127
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,440
- You have a car, Dr. Kano?
- Yes.

128
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,040
Let's get moving.

129
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,160
This concludes tonight's 
Bizarro Enthusiasts meeting.

130
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,560
Take me, too.

131
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,280
Good evening.

132
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,160
Who are you?

133
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,320
Who are you, 
and why are you here?

134
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,600
We're from a model agency -

135
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,200
a girl that we sent here on 
a job hasn't returned home.

136
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,880
A job? This house is abandoned.

137
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,880
The lights were on, 
so I thought I'd take a look.

138
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Well, let's look inside and 
see what's going on.

139
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,720
That door ain't going to open.

140
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,920
How did you...?

141
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,800
Nothing to it.

142
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,760
Hey...isn't this Keiko's?

143
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,320
It is - it's hers!

144
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,760
So we at least know 
that she got naked here.

145
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,480
Don't say something so scary!

146
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,920
Sis!

147
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,000
<i>MODEL MURDERED IN THE NUDE</i>

148
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,560
<i>MURDERED BEAUTY IN THE BATHTUB: CRAZED 
SPIDER-OWNING PAINTER, WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN</i>

149
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,480
And why mustn't I associate with 
the Bizarro Enthusiast Club?

150
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
By all means, you can -

151
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,240
but you're at the international 
forefront of psychiatry:

152
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,120
if you get too curious, you'll 
start to want greater thrills.

153
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,280
This vampiric Tsumura fellow 
was also a member, I recall.

154
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,640
And just what do you take 
the Bizarro Enthusiasts for?

155
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,120
You've been so careless about the club, 
now the police are looking in our direction!

156
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,640
Hirota.

157
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,040
You must tell every newspaper that the
 club has nothing to do with the ghost man.

158
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,440
Yes, sir.

159
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
It's too late, Dr. Kano.

160
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,240
It was one of our models 
that was killed, after all.

161
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,520
What's that? How dare 
you be so blasé!

162
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,080
In any case, the club has 
nothing to do with this case.

163
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,040
Maybe, maybe not.

164
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's only natural for them to be 
suspicious of high-profile members.

165
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,080
What? What exactly are you--!

166
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,800
Are you alright?

167
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm fine.

168
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,520
<i>Greetings, models from 
the Mutual Arts Club.</i>

169
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,520
<i>This is the Ghost Man.</i>

170
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:37,720
<i>I trust you all enjoyed the superb 
performance I put on for Act 1 of the show...</i>

171
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,560
- Come out of there!
- Wait - it's dangerous!

172
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,960
<i>And now, preparations for 
Act 2 have been completed,</i>

173
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,400
<i>and I am now 
looking for a co-star.</i>

174
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:52,920
<i>I truly hope the next one 
will be as splendid as the first.</i>

175
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,360
It's just a tape.
<i>I truly hope the next one 
will be as splendid as the first.</i>

176
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
<i>I truly hope the next one 
will be as splendid as the first.</i>

177
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,480
Let's listen to the end.
<i>I truly hope the next one 
will be as splendid as the first.</i>

178
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,600
Let's listen to the end.

179
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,440
<i>I look forward to your attendance. 
That's all from me - good night!</i>

180
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,080
Tea, please.

181
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,520
Hello? Yes, it's me.

182
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,560
Inspector Todoroki.

183
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,240
I'd like you to look 
into one more guy.

184
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,280
Matsubacho 23, Taito-ku.

185
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,920
Goes by the name of 
Kentaro Yamagata.

186
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,480
The kanji for "ken" is "<i>kane</i>". 
That'll be it for today.

187
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,120
Look into him carefully. 
I'll be here a while more.

188
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,720
Evening, Inspector.

189
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,480
Y'know...

190
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,280
...you needn't work so hard 
sifting through all your suspects.

191
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,560
The tape serves as 
great evidence, doesn't it?

192
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,240
Isn't there a more...
scientific way of investigating?

193
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
That might be enough for the 
Bizarro Enthusiasts, but not for us.

194
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,920
We've got to be preemptive about this 
second murder he's announced, in any case.

195
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,600
Exactly! Mr. Kikuchi's 
acting all indifferent about it,

196
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,960
even though we're the ones being hunted!
- That's right!

197
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,920
Take it a little more seriously, OK?

198
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,560
Alright, alright. My apologies.

199
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
Yes? Yes, that's right.

200
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Hello, sir. Inspector Todoroki - 
it's from headquarters.

201
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,480
Thank you.

202
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,360
Yes, hello? Yes.

203
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Yes. Hm? Taro Yamada?

204
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,840
Yes...yes...what?

205
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,280
Ah...yes. Alright, understood.

206
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,120
No such person as 
"Taro Yamada", apparently.

207
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,360
Which girl is he hiring?

208
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,200
Let's see...

209
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,480
...it's Mitsuko!

210
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,240
Nothing to worry about!

211
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
Could just be a prank.

212
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,360
It doesn't mean 
he's after you next!

213
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,960
Not to mention the fine fellows from 
the police force will be there with you.

214
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,520
Do you remember what 
kind of man he was?

215
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,520
Well...

216
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,160
...it says he called us on the 23rd.

217
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,800
I wonder which one he was...

218
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,680
Do you remember him?

219
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,560
How about you? And you?

220
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,120
Don't you remember him?

221
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,440
Now you mention it...

222
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,280
...there was one weird guy, right?
- Ah! Him!

223
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,400
Stop it!

224
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,520
I'm going to be killed...!

225
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,360
<i>TARO YAMADA, PAINTER, AOYAMA.
MODEL NAME: MITSUKO MIYAKAWA</i>

226
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,520
I'll keep you company overnight.

227
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,080
- You'll be fine.
- Thank you.

228
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,080
Don't leave me alone!

229
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,000
Mr. Kikuchi.

230
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,480
What a fright you gave me!

231
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,800
Anything out of the ordinary?

232
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,600
Of course not! Don't be silly.

233
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,600
Really?

234
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,040
Can you come along too, Kokichi?

235
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,920
Please...I'm scared.

236
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,920
Go on, then.

237
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,040
Sure, no problem.

238
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,000
Huh? Where are we going?

239
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,280
What's wrong?

240
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,640
You...!

241
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,080
Who are you?

242
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,080
Taro Yamada.

243
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,200
Please...spare my life!

244
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,760
I'll do anything! 
I don't want to die!

245
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,720
Keiko said the same thing.

246
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,880
I like the way women look 
when they are freshly dead.

247
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
No! I don't want to die!

248
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,280
Fine.

249
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,640
They won't find me, 
anyway - I give up.

250
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,120
Your face...

251
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,760
...take off those bandages!

252
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,280
I don't want to die not 
knowing who killed me!

253
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,840
Very well.

254
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,440
It makes no difference, I suppose.

255
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,440
I'll take them off for you.

256
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,360
Hello? Hello?

257
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,520
Hey, mister!

258
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,320
- She'll be killed.
- Huh?

259
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,920
She'll be killed!

260
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,520
- Mitsuko will be killed...
- Hello?

261
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,520
Pull yourself together. Who's that?

262
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,720
Who's Mitsuko?

263
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,680
Three-fingered man...

264
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,480
...three-fingered man...
- Three-fingered man?

265
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
Tsumura, the Ghost Man!

266
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,920
Hello? And who are you?

267
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,040
If he's telling the truth, 
something bad's happened!

268
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,240
There's been an incident in Mitaka. 
We just heard from the bureau.

269
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,840
Busy day today.

270
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,200
Call an ambulance, and 
tell HQ to look into this man.

271
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,200
- What's their condition?
- Nothing serious.

272
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,960
Hey, you can't take photos yet!

273
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,240
Are they alright?

274
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,240
They've just been drugged.

275
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,400
They'll come to in about an hour.

276
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,360
How did you know about this?

277
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,400
This is the work of the Ghost Man.

278
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Huh?

279
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,960
The Ghost Man phoned last night...

280
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,280
Why didn't you tell us?

281
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,520
Didn't think he would spare them.

282
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,960
I don't suppose you're related 
to this Ghost Man, are you?

283
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Take care of this for me, would you?

284
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,000
Get started, then.

285
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,080
This isn't a joke.

286
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,480
You think I'm related to 
the Ghost Man, too?

287
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,200
No, you idiot.

288
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,360
I think you shouldn't keep 
sticking your nose into this.

289
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,480
I'm a newspaper reporter.

290
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,880
You've only been focused on 
the Ghost Man incidents, though.

291
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,920
Anybody would think that's odd.

292
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,680
You want me to be a small 
fry reporter forever?

293
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm worried.

294
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,680
Ayuko...

295
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,760
Y'know, Ken, I'm...

296
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
Forget it. I shouldn't just blurt 
things out like you do.

297
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,360
Ayuko!

298
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,840
So...Tsumura and the Ghost Man 
are two different people, then?

299
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,200
Yes.

300
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,120
I didn't make it to the 
hideout, so I can't be sure,

301
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,520
but that's what Kokichi says.

302
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,960
Let's stop talking about it, OK?

303
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,680
Alright.

304
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,720
You were after a big scoop when 
you heard about the incident, right?

305
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,320
Guess you'll have to wait a bit longer.
- What are you on about?

306
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,840
In any case, I wish Dr. Kano would hurry 
back from Osaka and take us to a shoot.

307
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,360
I can't bear being 
shut up in here.

308
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,000
Couldn't we do a shoot 
somewhere far away?

309
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,200
Dr. Kano said he's 
thinking of a hotel in Izu.

310
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,040
It'd be lovely there.

311
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,840
That sounds good. It's been a 
while since we had a meeting.

312
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,040
Will Dr. Kano be back by then?

313
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,920
Of course he will!

314
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,880
Wait a minute...

315
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,360
...there's something 
odd about Dr. Kano.

316
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,920
You said he's in Osaka,

317
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,320
but I remember seeing him at Ginza.

318
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,240
There you go making 
strange remarks again.

319
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,240
<i>NUDE PHOTO SHOOT - IZU HYAKKA-EN HOTEL
MUTUAL ARTS CLUB</i>

320
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,200
Hey!

321
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,400
Not in front of everyone, you two!

322
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,920
I feel sorry for you 
without Mitsuko around.

323
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,640
Why'd he return her, do you think?

324
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,800
There was nothing wrong with her, 
right? I wonder why he took her.

325
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,280
She's not been the same since.

326
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,760
She's lost all of her spark.

327
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,520
- Big disappointment for me, too.
- Come, now.

328
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,720
Talk about that topic is 
out of bounds for today!

329
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,800
Time to eat.

330
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,920
- Dr. Kano - have you seen Sadako?
- No.

331
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,600
- Have you seen Sadako?
- She headed off that way earlier.

332
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,600
I wonder where she's got to.

333
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,560
Let's go eat.

334
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,840
Where's the other half?

335
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,160
And just who might you be?

336
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,080
Kosuke Kindaichi.

337
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,960
The private detective?

338
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,560
What gives you the 
right to be here?

339
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,920
I paid 5000 yen to become 
a registered participant.

340
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,240
Seems it was all 
for nought, however.

341
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,520
You knew this was 
going to happen?

342
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,760
Don't be ridiculous - if I did, 
I would've done something.

343
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,360
I'd like you all to 
return to the hotel.

344
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,000
You mustn't disturb 
the scene of the crime.

345
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,520
Please.

346
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,200
I apologize for the disruption,

347
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,120
but I must ask 
you to wait patiently.

348
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,600
Inspector Todoroki from 
HQ will arrive shortly.

349
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,760
It is of utmost importance that 
the crime scene is undisturbed.

350
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,000
While it is cramped in here, 
I must ask you to be patient.

351
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,080
Also, I want to ask you to turn 
in the film you shot today.

352
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,080
It will be your alibi -

353
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,360
or at the very least, 
it may be of some help.

354
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,080
- Go and collect them.
- What a waste of film...

355
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,480
- It's Todoroki.
- Come in.

356
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,680
- Hello.
- Hello, Inspector.

357
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,280
Another strange murder case, eh?

358
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,960
What time did you last 
meet with Sadako, Doctor?

359
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,200
One o'clock, perhaps? 
I'm afraid I don't recall.

360
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,720
I understand. An approximate 
time will do fine.

361
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,720
Why are you treating 
us like criminals?

362
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,840
We're merely asking 
everyone the same questions...

363
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,560
- The murder weapon has been found.
- Has it?

364
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,520
- That's medical equipment.
- Dr. Kano?

365
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,240
Bellboy!

366
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,720
Do you remember 
seeing that suitcase?

367
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,080
Yes, sir.

368
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,760
Someone who was referred by 
Dr. Kano was carrying it last night.

369
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,960
You, manager - wasn't 
the place fully reserved?

370
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,000
I received a call from Dr. Kano 
asking if he could arrive early.

371
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,440
I do not recall 
making that phone call.

372
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,800
People forget things. 
Listen, manager -

373
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,920
is that man amongst these people here?
- Let's see...

374
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
He is not.

375
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,440
Damn it.

376
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,520
Show us his room.

377
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
- Take care of this.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,960
This one.

379
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,960
Give it a knock.

380
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,680
Try the key.

381
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,840
God damn it...
two in one day.

382
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,120
Look into where the mannequin 
legs and hands came from.

383
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,480
Good day.

384
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,840
Making an order? We're 
backed up for quite a while.

385
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,040
No orders today, thanks.

386
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,040
We've a few questions for you.

387
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,920
I'm too busy to stop 
working right now.

388
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,600
I gathered as much.

389
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,920
You're considered as one of the 
best mannequin makers in Japan.

390
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,920
Not really.

391
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,600
This one's just 
like the real thing.

392
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,320
That one?

393
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,440
I just finished it.

394
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,000
She turned out pretty well.

395
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,200
- Satoshi!
- Yes?

396
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,840
We gotta hurry up and get 
this packed and sent.

397
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,280
I'll get the packaging.

398
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,960
I'm spending way too 
much time on her mouth.

399
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,080
Why's it gotta be such high 
quality if it's just a mannequin?

400
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,720
I wonder what it's being used for.

401
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,720
Beats me -

402
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,560
the guy said it just needed 
to show up well in a photo.

403
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,720
Nothing unusual.

404
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,440
What kind of person 
made the order?

405
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,520
Someone just like you.

406
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,200
Sounds like a good-looking man, 
if he's anything like me.

407
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,720
I didn't really get a look at him.

408
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,800
Said he'd had acid thrown on his face 
by a woman - head was in bandages.

409
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,160
Where's it being delivered to?

410
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,400
Why are you getting so nosy?

411
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,880
Just wondering what 
kind of guy he was.

412
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,080
Hey old man.

413
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,320
Old man?

414
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,360
So that's where you are!

415
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,600
You needn't be so shy.

416
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,200
What's this? Another act?

417
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,720
You'll catch a cold 
in that outfit...!

418
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,680
It's...not her!

419
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,200
Then just who is it, Dr. Kano?

420
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,440
Now see here - 
who's responsible for this?

421
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,040
We'd like to ask you 
the same question.

422
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,440
What? Me?

423
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,760
Why do you and the Ghost 
Man have the same hideout?

424
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,960
What are you saying? 
That I'm the Ghost Man?

425
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,680
- Perhaps.
- Nonsense.

426
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,280
These are the doings of 
someone trying to set me up!

427
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,960
Be that as it may,

428
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,160
it appears you were making a 
rendezvous with a married woman.

429
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,000
If that's not the case,

430
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,240
what exactly are 
you doing here?

431
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,760
I'll answer that.

432
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,480
Madam!

433
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,520
Let me say this, 
just to be clear.

434
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,000
This is a good, honest man.

435
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,640
If you arrest him, he'll be 
treated as the Ghost Man.

436
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,680
Until his alibi has been confirmed, 
I'm taking him into my care.

437
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,400
What happened? Are you alright?

438
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,440
We're fine. Quick, 
set up a perimeter.

439
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,120
"Towa Company, for luxury 
Western clothing materials.

440
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,160
Towa Company, specializing in 
Western clothing materials.

441
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,000
Towa is widely adored by 
everyone as a reliable,

442
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,560
cheap Western fabric store."

443
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,600
"In recent times, Towa has been...

444
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,440
Was it wrong of me to 
meet with you, Ken?

445
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,120
- Not really.
- I'm sorry.

446
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,040
I've just been so lonely.

447
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,320
I wish you weren't so quiet.

448
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,640
I've got something I 
need to discuss with you.

449
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,360
It's not like I'm angry 
with you or anything.

450
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,560
- Ayuko, I--
- Hey!

451
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,280
Can't wait to hear this.

452
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,560
I heard you quit modeling 
and became a stripper, Ayuko!

453
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,600
- Is that true, Ayuko?
- Well, now!

454
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,480
Even her lover doesn't know! 
That spells trouble.

455
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,120
How did you know 
that, Mr. Kikuchi?

456
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,320
I got sharp ears.

457
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,880
I know about how much you love a 
certain newspaper reporter, and lots more.

458
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,840
Goodbye, then. See you 
at the club sometime!

459
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,400
How did he know that?

460
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,000
Is it true, Ayuko?

461
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,040
That was what I wanted 
to talk to you about today.

462
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,720
I agree with the 
idea in general, but...

463
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,640
...do you have what it 
takes to be a stripper?

464
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,400
I got a pretty good offer 
from the Reijin Theater.

465
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,240
I feel a little frightened 
being at the club these days.

466
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,920
- Have I made a mistake?
- But - listen, I...

00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,440
I...

00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,160
...I can only think that these people 
are here to watch how you're killed!

489
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,840
I know.

490
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,800
Is that all you have to 
say? Foolish woman!

491
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,920
It doesn't matter where I go.

492
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,440
At least I'll be safer with 
lots of people around.

493
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,480
I've got to earn a 
living, in any case.

494
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,920
Ayuko...

495
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,000
...I'm sure my father will 
listen to our predicament.

496
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,440
I don't think so.

497
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,880
I'm a nude model - a stripper.

498
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,040
I'm certain my father will 
provide us with some money to--

499
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,480
Fire!

500
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,840
Hey! Everyone!

501
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,000
It's not a big fire!

502
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,200
Hey, listen! Calm down!

503
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,440
Hey! It's not a big deal!

504
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,040
There you are.

505
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,600
I decided to stay put 
to avoid the rabble.

506
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,040
- Good idea.
- Sorry for worrying you.

507
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,000
Don't mention it.

508
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,000
Detective! It was just smoke!

509
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,520
They really pulled a dumb prank 
this time. This is all it was.

510
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,520
- Show me.
-Here.

511
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:01,240
Is this one of the theater's?

512
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,480
Well...

513
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,520
...ours are much smaller. 
We can't use those kinds.

514
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,360
You know what I think, Detective?

515
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,440
The theater's getting old 
and run down these days -

516
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,680
I think some trickster just 
wanted part of the action tonight.

517
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,640
I love these kinds of whodunit cases! 
We're gonna catch this fellow for sure!

518
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,080
<i>WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE DISTURBANCE
NO DAMAGE INCURRED - THE SHOW WILL CONTINUE</i>

519
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,760
Yes?

520
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,680
Everything alright?

521
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,120
The girl third from the 
left is pretty charming.

522
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,880
What's her name?

523
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,080
- You got eyes for her?
- She's already got 3 guys, you know.

524
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,080
Only 3?

525
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,960
Welcome.

526
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,760
But that's so cruel, Ayuko...!

527
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,560
The world's a 
cruel place, you know.

528
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,320
You can't see it through 
your naivety, though.

529
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,240
What a single woman has 
to do to make a living...

530
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,640
...it's both thrilling, and terrifying.

531
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,640
Why, even you, Ken...

532
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,680
Stop talking nonsense!

533
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,080
I don't want your life
 to be in danger!

534
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,920
Watch my performance carefully, Ken.

535
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,160
It's going to be wonderful.

536
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,120
They're ready for you, Ayuko.

537
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,480
Let's head out.

538
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,120
Could you get Mr. Kajiwara for me?

539
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,520
Yes?

540
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,720
Mr. Kajiwara, Ayuko sent for you.

541
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,680
Come in.

542
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,600
What is it?

543
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,960
Ah - I just wanted 
to rehearse a bit.

544
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,560
Alright.

545
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,480
Let's see...

546
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,320
Huh? It's a mannequin!

547
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,720
Where's Kajiwara?

548
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,360
The manager went to look for him!

549
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,800
To think he'd use 
a mannequin like this...

550
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,240
- How bizarre.
- Where's the real Ayuko, I wonder?

551
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,600
- Manager! Where's Kajiwara?
- I found him, but--

552
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,880
- Anybody else been here but you?
- No.

553
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,320
Looks like the 
next act is starting.

554
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,080
Damn it!

555
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,360
Get her down, quick!

556
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,200
Ayuko!

557
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,240
Ayuko...Ayuko!

558
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,880
Hands off the crime scene!

559
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,320
What's this?

560
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,480
Wait...no!

561
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,080
No! It wasn't me!

562
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,520
Shut it.

563
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,360
Those three teeth are enough 
to pin you to the crime.

564
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,360
If you please, Inspector.

565
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,200
Wait! No! It wasn't me!

566
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,040
You've got the wrong guy!

567
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,520
<i>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
ROOM 6</i>

568
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,000
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

569
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,240
Here.

570
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,200
Alright. I was 
the first Ghost Man,

571
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,320
but that was it!

572
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,920
I only threatened Keiko - 
I would never kill her!

573
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,440
He's still out there.

574
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,560
Who's responsible for 
the second murder, then?

575
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,920
- Not me, that's for sure!
- Whatever you say.

576
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,520
I don't care if it's one guy 
or Ghostman brothers.

577
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,720
How'd you come up 
with something like that?

578
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,320
As a newspaper reporter...

579
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,200
...I wanted to 
get the best scoop.

580
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,440
Isn't your father working a 
high position at your paper?

581
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,040
- Why'd you try so hard?
- That's exactly why I panicked!

582
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,440
I couldn't stand 
disappointing my father.

583

598
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,320
Kind of a disappointing result.

599
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,000
- He's not admitting anything!
- I should think not.

600
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,320
- He doesn't know anything, after all.
- Huh?

601
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,960
He's the victim here. I asked 
him to do a little job for me.

602
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,600
You think we're 
safe releasing him?

603
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,000
He'll lead us to the Ghost Man 
any minute now, I think.

604
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,720
Yes? It's for you, Mr. Kindaichi.

605
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,880
Yes?

606
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,320
What?

607
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,920
So he was at Yanokura!

608
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,080
I'll be there right away.

609
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,520
I'll be off then, Inspector Todoroki.

610
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,240
What did you do with him?

611
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,120
What do you plan 
to do with him?

612
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,240
This man is getting in my way!

613
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,680
Let me go! Just 
exactly who are you?

614
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,320
Everyone calls me Ghost Man.

615
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,040
Coward!

616
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,640
Kinuko!

617
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,760
Kinuko...do you 
know what it's like?

618
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,000
For a man to truly 
love a woman?

619
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,760
What? Let me go!

620
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,440
Let me go!

621
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,920
Get a good look, Doctor.

622
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,640
I'm going to do whatever I like 
with her right in front of you!

623
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,240
Get off me!

624
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
I'm married, you know!

625
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,920
And your husband Tsumura
 is a crazed maniac.

626
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,520
So then...

627
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,200
...what exactly is 
that man to you?

628
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,880
Your lover?

629
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,520
I divorced Tsumura!

630
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,680
And he went mad as a result. 
Is that what you wanted?

631
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,200
Why don't we see 
what he thinks?

632
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,520
Tsumura! Tsumura!

633
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,840
Mind if I answer for him?

634
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,600
You!

635
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,920
I've finally seen him -

636
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,040
the famous Ghost Man killer.

637
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,760
No! The killer is Tsumura!

638
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,760
- We heard it all from Tsumura.
- What are you going on about?

639
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:14,200
- This man is a crazed maniac!
- And who used that maniac?

640
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,920
Give it up, you murderer!

641
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,920
Be a man and 
turn yourself in.

642
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,880
It wasn't me!

643
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,000
It wasn't me!

644
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,080
I didn't mean to kill anyone!

645
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,400
Why'd you take Tsumura's 
ex-wife hostage, then?

646
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,240
She's my girl.

647
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:28,480
I'm in love with her - she's 
the one I ought to be with!

648
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,280
The woman that's trying to 
become Dr. Kano's wife?

649
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,840
Tsumura's the one that 
took those women!

650
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,840
Tsumura was known for his thirst for blood, 
but you were the one pulling the strings.

651
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,320
You're a fiend. All in the 
needless pursuit of one woman.

652
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,840
It wasn't me - 
it was Ken Tatebe!

653
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,680
Ken might have 
played the first prank,

654
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,400
but you assumed the lead role.

655
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,360
I know everything.

656
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,360
Lies! Lies!

657
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,000
Lies!

658
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,080
I'll shoot!

659
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,160
Throw down your gun!
This is the end of line!

660
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:12,280
