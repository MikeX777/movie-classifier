                Sorry, I'm late.

No problem.

   of faggotry.                 

112
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,273
        Stop the spread         
        of faggotry.            

113
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,153
[sighs]                         

114
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:05,458
  Okay, just because            
  we used to date the same loser

115
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,693
      doesn't mean we have to be
      all cunty to each other.  

116
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:11,530
You're right. Truce?            

117
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:15,333
                  Oh, I'm s--

00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:21,238

    What's wrong?               

119
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,906
                       I just...

120
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:25,608
              I don't want to be
              a slut anymore.   

121
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,610
             I want a boyfriend.

122
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:30,111
                  [sobbing]     

123
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:33,847
        I just really wish Caleb
        was still here.         

124
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,783
  Is that the heterosexual      
  you were trying to sleep with?

125
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,117
               No. Well, yes.   

126
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,052
          He was my roommate    
          who I used to want.   

127
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,386
       Your roommate dumped you?

128
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:42,954
     No, my boyfriend dumped me.

129
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:45,022
        My roommate isn't here  
        to help me through this.

130
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:47,257
So, is your roommate the gay one
or the straight one?            

131
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:49,325
     You're not listening to me.
     My boyfriend's gay,        

132
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:52,394
       and not just that,       
       he's the hottest gay     
       I will ever make it with.

133
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,696
  Honey, you're gonna make it   
  with plenty of hotties.       

134
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:58,232
Mom, it's not even that.        
He's gonna find a new boyfriend 
first, and I'm gonna be alone.  

135
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,200
              <i>You are not</i>       
              <i>going to be alone.</i>

136
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:03,102
     There are plenty           
     of rainbow fish in the sea.

137
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:05,637
                          Ha-ha.
Plenty of cocks in the henhouse.

138
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,606
                            Mom!
     Plenty of freshmen ass     
     in the locker room.        

139
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:09,707
                  Ew, Mom!      

140
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:13,376
        Kyle, I am              
        really trying here.     

141
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:16,412
            I know, Mom. Thanks.

142
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:19,982
Do you have any idea            
what it's like to be a gay man  
trapped inside a woman's body?  

143
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:21,817
               My God,          
               you have no idea.

144
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:23,819
Well, there's, like,            
five gay men trapped inside me, 

145
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:25,887
and they're all greasy          
and having sex with each other  

146
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,022
and just trying                 
to fuck their way out.          

147
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,157
               Send me an X-ray.

148
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,159
Why are you being               
all Fiona Apple?                

149
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,661
          I broke up with Shane.
He's single?                    

150
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,329
         Hands off, cock-monger.

151
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,164
[laughs]                        
I'm kidding.                    

152
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,900
   What is it with straight guys
   and their aversion           
   to sucking dick?             

153
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:42,568
       I just got dumped.       

154
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,003
       What is with gay guys    
       wanting to suck          
       everyone's dick?         

155
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:47,638
Yeah, I heard.                  
I'm so sorry.                   
                Thanks.         

156
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,039
Sorry you're a psychopath.      

157
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,740
I say this with                 
my trademark sweetness,         

158
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:53,642
but you do know that Marc       
was the best thing that will    
ever happen to you?             

159
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:56,111
      Hey, I'm a catch.         
Says who? Your mom?             

160
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:59,581
     Other people do, too.      

161
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,583
I just...                       

162
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,651
I just want to hear             
"I love you"                    

163
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,654
instead of "Take it,            
you tight little snatch."       

164
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,089

                inlet overlay.  

167
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,192
                 My wife has one
                 just like it.

          are sick to death     
          with still life,

    that we tried something

How rustic.

00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,949
                    Troy.       

225
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,617
From Troy.                      
              Illinois.         

226
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:57,119
    [clears throat]             
    Oh, are those your drawings?

227
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,420
Yeah.                           

228
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:02,557
This is mine.                   
That's Kyle's, and Tiffani's.   

229
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,559
I've never drawn one before,    
so I figured                    

230
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,228
that I would                    
just focus on it.               

231
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,297
     Well, you're very generous.
I'm a giver.                    

232
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,464
Aw, this one's incredible.      

233
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:14,967
Thanks.                         
You just spoke to me.           

234
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,735
Are you an art major?           
  No.                           

235
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,870
     She's undeclared, which is 
     practically the same thing.

236
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:20,805
            Well, you should be.

237
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:23,641
How'd you get into              
nude modeling?                  

238
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:25,476
              Well, I grew up   
              in the country,   

239
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,478
       and no one's around,     
       so I just go naked a lot.

240
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,647
         Then I bought a Webcam.
            I'm so Googling you.

241
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,182
          When I moved here,    
          I found I can get paid
          to hang out naked.    

242
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:34,550
       I was like, "Sign me up!"

243
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:35,584
             Next stop, porn.   

244
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:38,920
How much does that ass          
of yours bring in?              

245
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:42,056
           Oh, 50 bucks a class.
Porn pays way better.           

246
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,958
  Yeah, I'd just as likely do it
  for a case of beer or weed.   

247
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,493
Ah, noted.                      
  When did you move here?       

248
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,062
A couple weeks ago.             
  All by your lonesome?         

249
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:52,431
Yeah.                           
  I'll bet it was great.        

250
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,933
Start over where no one         
knows your name.                

251
00:11:54,935 --> 00:11:58,169
You can do anything you want    
with whomever you want.         

252
00:11:58,171 --> 00:11:59,904
                    I guess.    

253
00:11:59,906 --> 00:12:01,739
            Kind of miss my mom.

254
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:03,707
             Oh, so you're close
             to your mom?       

255
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,542
         I miss both my parents,

256
00:12:05,544 --> 00:12:07,844
          but there's something 
          about a mom, you know?

257
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:10,379
    A boy needs none other      
    than the love of his mother.

258
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,681
                     Yeah.      

259
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:14,783
Hey, we were gonna              
go grab some coffee.            
You wanna come?                 

260
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:17,786
       Ah, I got to get home.   
       But thanks for the offer.

261
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:20,455
Maybe some other time?          
  Someone waiting for you       
  at home?                      

262
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,190
                Uh, my roommate.

263
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:24,625
                He's secretly   
                in love with me.

264
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:27,461
I'll see you in class.          
Keep up the good work.          

265
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:31,131
Oh, keep up the good penis!     

266
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,799
[Man]                           
Stop the spread of faggotry.    

267
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,567
I totally thought               
he was a 'mo                    

268
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:36,502
till he made that lame          
straight-guy joke.              

269
00:12:36,504 --> 00:12:39,838
              He's an enigma    
              fucking a riddle  
              fucking a mystery.

270
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,873
      I love being single.      

271
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,908
Stop the spread                 
of faggotry.                    

272
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,609
     But spreading              
     is my favorite thing.      

273
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,545
    I'll be praying for you.    

274
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,325
[Gwen]                          
Hold that pose.                 

275
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:07,895
Would you boys do me a favor    
and just sit there for a minute?

276
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,229
             Or 20?             

277
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:10,930
But I want him                  
out of here in five.            

278
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:13,399
       What's her story?        

279
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,401
I, uh, used to flirt            
with this one,                  

280
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,770
but we never did anything       
'cause I wasn't available.      

281
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:20,405
So we're going to make up       
for lost time.                  

282
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:23,307
[door opens]                    

283
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:24,808
            Man whore!          

284
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,643
[door closes]                   
               [sighs]          

285
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:28,444
          Lucky bastard.        

286
00:13:28,446 --> 00:13:30,379
[Kyle]                          
See that guy over there?        

287
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:32,647
The studly rack of meat         
or your loser ex-boyfriend?     

288
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:36,150
 The meat rack. Marc pre-cheated
 with him and with a couple     
 of other guys, too.            

289
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:38,152
He pre-cheated?                 
   It's this thing that gays do.

290
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:40,521
  The moment their relationship 
  starts getting a little rocky,

291
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:42,623
       they start lining up     
       replacement sex partners.

292
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,159
      The second they're single,
      it's, "Hey, remember me?  
      You want some head?"      

293
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:48,094
Your boyfriend's                
far too creampuff               
to cheat.                       

294
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:49,929
        I didn't say he cheated.
        He pre-cheated.         

295
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:51,997
God, you're paranoid.           
      I know how his mind works.

296
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,932
          If I were hot enough, 
          I'd do the same thing.

297
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,134
              I guess it's over.

298
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,269
              Look what I found!
    Hey.                        

299
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,838
                         Troy!  
        Nude guy!               

300
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,974
So, Troy, the three of us       
are falling behind in art class,
and we were wondering...        

301
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:07,710
Do you have                     
a preference?                   

302
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:09,645
    Uh...                       

303
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:13,448
[coughing]                      

304
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,150
See? It works.                  

305
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:17,451
Now take off                    
your clothes, damn it.          

306
00:14:18,453 --> 00:14:20,120
          This is kind of weird.

307
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:21,955
  No. Come on.                  
  We're just gonna draw, really.

308
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:27,527
So, did you leave someone       
special back home?              

309
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:28,628
                 Nope.          

310
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,997
    That's probably good.       
                      Yep.      

311
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:33,866
I've always wondered            
what it would be like           
to live on a farm.              

312
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:35,901
I mean,                         
what did you do for fun?        

313
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:39,070
  Mostly, we'd just drive around
  the strip on weekends         

314
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,839
     or-- or throw parties      
     in some field.             

315
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,741
I always liked the idea         
of being out among all          
the nature,                     

316
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:46,976
getting fucked                  
in a rainstorm,                 

317
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:48,377
getting fucked                  
in a tractor,                   

318
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,312
getting fucked in a...          

319
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:52,047
       [laughs]                 
       Can't say I did all that.

320
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,716
Well, where did you             
get fucked?                     
               I don't know.    

321
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:57,218
               Regular places.  
               Bed.             

322
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,819
                         My car.
         In the ass?            

323
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:00,420
                   Excuse me?   

324
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:03,055
         Oops. I mean,          
         boys or girls?         

325
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,923
                      Uh...     

326
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:08,393
Uh, I'm sorry. If you don't     
want to talk about this...      

327
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:10,795
           No, it's-- it's okay,
           I guess.             

328
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,797
                   Girls,       

329
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,165
                   mostly.      

330
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,533
           [gasping]            

331
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:18,502
   Why? Does that freak you out?
Oh, honey, no.                  

332
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:22,005
I'm what they call a fag hag.   
           So you are gay, then.

333
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:24,540
I am...                         
       I'm not gay. It's just...

334
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,709
       Well, all kinds of people
       hit on me,               

335
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,544
            so I just kind of   
            go along with it.   

336
00:15:29,546 --> 00:15:30,778
              What the hell     
              does that mean?   

337
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,279
        I like it.              

338
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,648
I mean,                         
we're all just people.          

339
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,717
   Just bodies                  
   with organic needs.          

340
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,885
          So, did you ever      
          have a girlfriend?    
                    Sort of.    

341
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:42,988
What about boyfriends?          

342
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,157
        Well, I-- I had         
        this really close friend
        in high school.         

343
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,259
           But I never done much
           with a guy before,   

344
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,227
    'cause I want to get married
    and have kids.              

345
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:53,230
        Not that gay guys can't,
        'cause they can.        

346
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:54,898
                 It's just...   

347
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
                I don't know.   

348
00:15:56,902 --> 00:16:00,069
            Being gay just seems
            like so much work.  
               Amen, sister.    

349
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,404
              First, you have to
              tell everyone.    
              That's no fun.    

350
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:04,572
              And then          
              there's rejection.
        You're never hot enough.

351
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:06,440
                      STDs.     
             If you're lucky.   

352
00:16:06,442 --> 00:16:08,575
            There's this group--
            Coming In.          

353
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:11,311
        I kind of wanna go      
        check 'em out, 'cause I 
        think they might fix me.

354
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:13,813
The antigays?                   
                    Ex-gays.    

355
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:16,916
Just like you, Kyle, right?     
                    What?       

356
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:19,418
                         What?  
Kyle used to be gay.            

357
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,454
[gasps]                         
You two should hang out,        
get to know each other,         

358
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:24,989
   swap stories.                
               [nervous chuckle]

359
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:26,924
               You're an ex-gay?

360
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,927
[Kyle]                          
Well...                         

361
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,029
          You're, like, my idol.

362
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:35,297
 I totally just wanna get inside
 of you and learn everything.   

363
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:37,132
                   Uh...        

364
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:39,801
                 Oh, my God!    

365
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,436
    You two are together, right?

366
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,140
Yes. Yes.                       
                   Yeah.        

367
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:50,008
We are boyfriend                
and girlfriend.                 

368
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,676
          God, I knew it!       

369
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,544
        You're always together, 
        but I wasn't sure.      

370
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,046
          It must've been the...
   The fact that I act so faggy?

371
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,881
         And you're             
         really straight now?   

372
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,383
             As a cucumber.     

373
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:05,452
    God! No wonder I felt       
    so comfortable with you two.

374
00:17:05,454 --> 00:17:08,254
     How long you been together?
Uh...                           

375
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:10,089
a few months.                   
                 Yeah.          

376
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:13,325
And it's true love.             
Open up, my little sex monkey.  
                Oh! Oh, God!    

377
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:15,327
                 [nervous laugh]
[forced laugh]                  

378
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,028
              You're comfortable
              that he used to...

379
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,696
Smoke sausage?                  

380
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:20,597
You know, we've all got         
skeletons in our closet.        

381
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,166
His are just more well hung.    
   And how's that going for you?

382
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,002
Well, how do you think          
it's going for him?             
Look at me. I'm perfect.        

383
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,371
      Yeah. Yeah, she's awesome.

384
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:31,940
Oh! He especially loves         
my titties.                     
                 [shudders]     

385
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,374
      Breasts!                  

386
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,942
 So, what are the meetings like?

387
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:38,712
    Oh, uh, you know, I've never
    been to this chapter.       
    I don't--                   

388
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:43,116
     Oh, my God. Would you do me
     the biggest favor?         
         Of course I'd do you...

389
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:45,785
       You have to take me      
       to one of these meetings.
       There's one tomorrow.    

390
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:48,020
    You could be, like,         
    my-- my sponsor or whatever.

391
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:49,521
You know, honey, do it.         

392
00:17:49,523 --> 00:17:52,657
It might do you some good       
to renew your vows              
to heterosexuality.             

393
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:54,692
Not that he doesn't             
ride me every night.            

394
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:56,293
[chuckles]                      

395
00:17:56,295 --> 00:17:58,895
               Uh, okay.        

396
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:01,130
                    It's a date!
             [chuckles]         

397
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:03,098
      I'll be right back.       
      I have to go use the head.

398
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,402
          What the hell         
          just happened?        

399
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:10,404
We just got you laid            
by Troy from Illinois.          

400
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,840
  You made me into an ex-gay.   
  Those are my least            
  favorite kinds of gays.       

401
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,675
                Grow some nuts. 
                Do you think    
                he would've been

402
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,344
           remotely interested  
           in you if you were   
           just another gay guy?

403
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:19,845
Listen to me.                   

404
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:22,080
I don't have a chance           
in this godforsaken world       

405
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:25,316
of wrapping my lips             
around his 40 acres and a mule, 
but you do.                     

406
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:28,852
 So you're saying               
 he'll let me have sex with him 
 because I'm <i>not</i> gay?           

407
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:31,921
               You heard him.   
               You'll be his new
               close friend.    

408
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:35,024
          Since you're straight,
          you'll get to hang out
          with him.             

409
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:38,027
           You'll support him   
           in all those straight
           emo bonding ways     

410
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,395
              until, eventually,

411
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:42,831
       all his repressed passion
       explodes!                

412
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,567
Right down                      
your throat.                    

413
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,436
       This is sick.            
       You're both sick!        

414
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:51,439
    You think it could work?    

415
00:18:56,211 --> 00:18:57,711
                     Damn!      

416
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:02,480
          Hey.                  

417
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:05,149
                    No way.     

418
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:08,218
        I'm so nervous.         
                      It's okay.

419
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,552
      You'll be fine.           

420
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:15,124
What are you doing?             
Straight-male bonding.          
Just have fun.                  

421
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:27,067
[chattering]                    

422
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,640
                          Hi.   

423
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,807
           [Men]                
           Hi.                  

424
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,409
I'm Octavio.                    
                        [Man]   
                        Octavio.

425
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,145
       Introductions lead       
       to conversations,        

426
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,281
   lead to invitations          
   of intercourse               
   with the wrong persuasion.   

427
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,082
    I'll do the introducing.    

428
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,317
   What the hell do you want?   

429
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,519
   Oh, uh...                    
                We want to join.

430
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:53,521
  I find that hard to believe.  

431
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,556
Maybe we should leave.          
                God believes me.

432
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:57,624
   Well, I did pray for you.    

433
00:19:57,626 --> 00:19:58,825
                         I know.

434
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:00,426
Spooky.                         

435
00:20:00,428 --> 00:20:03,429
      I'm Jacob Buchanan,       
      Coming In president.      

436
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:07,132
     This is Derek, Allan,      
     Roy and, uh...             

437
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:08,266
           Violet.              

438
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:09,500
            Violet.             

439
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:11,602
          Well, I'm Kyle, and...
     Troy.                      

440
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:13,637
           [all]                
           Hi, Troy.            
     Hi.                        

441
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:16,072
      Hello, Kyle.              
                     [Jacob]    
                     You do know

442
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:18,808
      what we're all about here,
      right, at Coming In?      

443
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,311
Well, yeah, but he              
doesn't need to be here.        

444
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:25,647
He's a success story.           
               [nervous chuckle]

445
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:28,249
Kyle's renouncing               
his sexuality?                  

446
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:31,151
What's going on?                
           Are you sitting down?

447
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:34,220
Now, who'd like to speak first? 
Okay, I will.                   

448
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:37,556
     I have some great news     
     that is gonna change       
     all of our lives.          

449
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:40,525
       I have been asked        
       to present               

450
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,895
    the new ad campaign         
    for Coming In National.     

451
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:47,764
  The board of directors,       
  including my mom,             
  is gonna be here next week,   

452
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:49,532
        and if they like        
        my presentation,        

453
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,233
        which they will,        

454
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,934
  you're gonna see my posters   

455
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,902
      in high schools           
      and college campuses      

456
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:57,404
       across the nation.       

457
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:02,908
 "Homo no more.                 
 Stop the spread of faggotry."  

458
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,012
  Now, I need you to repeat     
  this slogan to every student  
  across campus.                

459
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:11,316
 "Homo no more" is gonna become 
 a national catchphrase.        

460
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:14,052
Like,                           
"Can you hear me now?"          

461
00:21:14,054 --> 00:21:16,120
    Yeah, only more clever.     

462
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:19,690
 So, let's have a testimonial.  
 Who wants to start?            

463
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,530
        I sucked a dick.        

464
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:29,431
        Shut up.                
        Are you serious?        

465
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,433
          Like a fox.           
                That's fabulous.

466
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:33,168
What was it like?               
Details.                        

467
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,304
     Yeah, yeah.                
     Well, tell us how it       
     made you feel, Violet.     

468
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:38,906
Well, I got really trashed      

469
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:40,507
at the Up With Jesus kegger,    

470
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,575
and this skinny guy             

471
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:44,677
with dyed black hair            
and lipstick                    

472
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:48,013
asked if I wanted               
to do one of those              
upside-down keg shooters.       

473
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:53,017
   They started playing         
   My Chemical Romance,         
   so I took that as a sign.    

474
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:57,487
Downed half the keg,            
and before I knew it, we were   
in the back of his mom's Saab-- 

475
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:59,989
      choking on his dick,      

476
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:03,459
      my makeup smearing,       
      I'm about to puke.        

477
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,127
         It was great.          

478
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:06,862
I watched porn.                 

479
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:11,132
         Straight porn.         
         And I made sure        
         it was Ron Jeremy,     

480
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:12,666
         so I wouldn't focus    
         on his, um...          

481
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,100
             Yeah.              
Yeah.                           

482
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,402
                 And it was hot.

483
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:20,104
          Good. Good.           

484
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,806
    Allan, how are              
    things going with, um...    

485
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,674
      Was her name Leslie?      

486
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,510
       I think so. Yeah.        

487
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,545
         Uh, we went on a date. 

488
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:31,213
       And what happened        
       on this date?            

489
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:33,682
      We went to this cute      
      little Italian restaurant.

490
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:34,849
              Service was great.

491
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,584
      No. No, no.               
      I meant physically.       

492
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:39,286
                   Oh, well, um,

493
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:41,788
       after dinner,            
       we went back to her dorm.

494
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,290
Were you nervous?               
                       Oh, yeah.

495
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:46,225
Turned on?                      
                        Well... 

496
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:48,193
I'm trusting at some point      
you got turned on, right?       

497
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:51,562
          Oh, yeah! Yeah!       

498
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:53,196
[chuckles]                      

499
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:58,033
            Totally...turned on.
            Rock hard.          

500
00:22:58,035 --> 00:23:00,068
  Tell me about that.           

501
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,338
              Uh, um, let's see.
              [chuckles]        

502
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,106
              We sat on her bed,

503
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,807
        and she showed me       
        this photo album she had

504
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:10,342
     of this Japanese internment
     camp she had visited.      

505
00:23:10,344 --> 00:23:15,045
           And we were balancing
           the book on our legs,

506
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:17,280
                 and her knee   
                 grazed my knee,

507
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:19,949
                and that kind of
                got me going.   
                [laughs]        

508
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:21,383
           And then?            

509
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:22,884
                           Then?

510
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,255
                   She jumped   
                   on top of me.

511
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:29,389
           Really?              

512
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:32,158
              And, uh, I let her
              kiss me and stuff.

513
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,995
Good! Good.                     
Now, did she go for second base?

514
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:39,897
Run her hands up and down       
your smooth chest               
underneath your shirt?          

515
00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:41,899
             A little.          

516
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:45,768
     Might not count.           
     Why don't you show me?     

517
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:51,907
     Like...this, I guess.      

518
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:58,712
[Jacob]                         
But never the nipples?          
                   No.          

519
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:01,448
On this date,                   
did you think about men?        

520
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,950
                         No. No.
Never?                          

521
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:05,851
What about                      
your locker room fantasy?       

522
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:09,954
Thrusting jockstraps,           
towels snapping at your ass.    

523
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:13,223
         I never said anything  
         about towels.          

524
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:15,391
            Well...             

525
00:24:15,393 --> 00:24:16,692
    next week's assignment--    

526
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:19,261
 and I'm holding you to this--  
 is third base.                 

527
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:21,463
        But what about the girl?

528
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:23,731
     Leslie?                    
              Yeah, Leslie.     

529
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:26,233
         Shouldn't I respect her
         and stuff?             
Don't worry.                    

530
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,235
She's not gonna get pregnant.   

531
00:24:28,237 --> 00:24:30,537
       All I'm asking for       
       is one finger...         

532
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,572
       [swooshing sound]        
       in her bush.             

533
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,443
   So, I'm fascinated to hear   
   your guys's stories.         

534
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,978
I'm not ready                   
to talk yet.                    

535
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,380
But, uh, Kyle here              
has got a hottie girlfriend,    

536
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:45,449
and they can't keep             
their hands off each other.     

537
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:48,718
    You...have a girlfriend?    
                         Mm-hmm.

538
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,321
    And you used to be gay?     
                           Yeah.

539
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,756
      Well, why don't you       
      tell us, Kyle,            

540
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,691
      what brought about        
      this amazing change?      

541
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:59,628
                 Uh, my story...

542
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,897
      Just speak from the heart,
      like Jesus would.         

543
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,134
                  Well, I was...

544
00:25:07,136 --> 00:25:09,436
           pretty much born gay.

545
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:10,837
          Mom said              
          my first sentence was,

546
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,172
          "Get those boobs      
          out of my face," so...

547
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:17,041
       Anyway, uh,              
       I lived the gay lifestyle
       for a while,             

548
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:19,042
                  and I dated   
                  a lot of guys.

549
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:24,914
        A lot...of guys.        

550
00:25:24,916 --> 00:25:27,416
              Just mens         
              and mens and mens.

551
00:25:27,418 --> 00:25:29,351
    I mean, they were calling me
    all the time.               

552
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:31,720
          "Kyle, please have sex
          with me. Please!"     

553
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:34,823
               I was so popular.
       [Jacob] But then it began
       to take its toll.        

554
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,625
 See, you realized that gays--  

555
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:39,793
    they're not interested      
    in getting to know you.     

556
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:42,395
  No, as soon as you put out,   
  they vanish,                  

557
00:25:42,397 --> 00:25:45,398
  and then they never           
  call you back when they say   
  they're gonna call you back,  

558
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,566
because they're out             
with some stud                  

559
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:50,802
    when they say               
    they should be in class!    

560
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:52,603
            I wouldn't say that.

561
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:54,938
    Well, then, what exactly    
    would you say, Kyle?        

562
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,406
  What brought about            
  this amazing transformation?  

563
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:01,943
              Well, I got fed up

564
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:05,313
        with the men            
        and the sex and the fun,

565
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,415
         the music              
         and the apple martinis.

566
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,784
 And just when                  
 I didn't know what else to do, 

567
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:12,453
   an angel from heaven above   
   flew into my life.           

568
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:17,924
     A sexy 52-24-48 angel      
     named Tiffani.             

569
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:20,593
       Is Tiffani a rhinoceros? 
    Size doesn't matter.        

570
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,629
    What matters is,            
    is that I fell in love,     
    and I never looked back.    

571
00:26:24,697 --> 00:26:25,697
                       Oh, stop.

572
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,600
         But what about the sex?

573
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:32,169
       Oh, it's a piece of cake.
       I just say, "Kyle,       

574
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:35,472
       "take everything you love
       about Reese Witherspoon  
       and project it           

575
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:37,440
      onto this girl            
      who wants to be with you."

576
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,841
  And now I can't get enough.   

577
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:40,142
That's incredible.              

578
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:41,543
         Yeah, 'cause you seem  
         really gay.            

579
00:26:41,545 --> 00:26:44,245
 Not anymore. I'm telling you,  
 there is nothing               

580
00:26:44,247 --> 00:26:47,214
  like the smooth, wet,         
  porcelain lips of the vagina  

581
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:49,149
  spreading and enveloping me,  

582
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:52,518
      squeezing against         
      the head of my dick       
      ever so firmly.           

583
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,119
       And that's nothing       

584
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:57,988
 compared to what it feels like 
 to eat her out                 

585
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,857
    and lap up                  
    all those fresh juices.     

586
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,325
                      [coughing]

587
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:04,192
                 [snaps fingers]

588
00:27:06,895 --> 00:27:08,896
       Well, we look forward    
       to seeing you both again.

589
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:10,831
Well, we both look forward      
to coming.                      
        <i>¶ ["Hallelujah Chorus"]</i>

00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,834
        With girls.             
        A little ex-gay joke.   

591
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:16,503

594
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:23,142
                That was fun!   
That was nerve-racking.         

595
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:26,478
         Yeah, you were sweating
         like a suicide bomber  
         on a summer jihad.     

596
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,214
Man, I love your...

Man, you really dig             
your pussy.                     

599
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:35,853
              Yeah. So, what are
              you up to now?    

600
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,655
I gotta go model                
for Mr. Thompson's art class.   

601
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,858
Hey, uh, are we still on        
for tomorrow's game?

          Go, local sports team!

[laughs]                        

604
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,953
This must be                    
the right place.                
                           Hey. 

605
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:17,289
Hey, I'm Marc,                  
Professor Thompson's            
next top model.                 

606
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,125
But I use the word              
"top" loosely.                  

607
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:22,560
Wow, great body.                
                   Yeah, I know.

608
00:28:22,562 --> 00:28:24,295
I meant you.                    

609
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:26,030
                 Oh. Oh, thanks.

610
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:28,065
You're, uh,                     
supposed to wear it             
over your shoulders.            

611
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:29,866
                           What?
The robe.                       

612
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:33,135
                       Oh. Yeah.

613
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:36,037
Did you want some privacy?      
'Cause I could come back.       

614
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,040
      No. No. I'm gonna be naked
      in front of 15 people.    

615
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:42,109
                  You're easy.  
How would you know?             

616
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:45,145
             No, I-- I wouldn't.

617
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:47,213
Anyway, <i>we're</i> gonna be naked    
in front of 15 people.          

618
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:49,148
                   Huh?         
We're posing together.          

619
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,216
                Seriously?      
You got a problem with that?    

620
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:53,952
         No, of-- of course not.

621
00:28:58,557 --> 00:28:59,890
               Are you gay?     

622
00:28:59,892 --> 00:29:02,792
Well, yeah.                     
You got a problem with that?    

623
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:05,394
       N-No, I-- I don't        
       have a problem with that.

624
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:07,462
I mean, you're not straight,    
are you?                        

625
00:29:08,464 --> 00:29:10,798
                       Well...

       Oh, my heck!             
       Who-- Who are you?

                   your model.

           Well, what about him?

629
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:22,174
           You didn't request   
           two models for today?

00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,342
 I have the Student Services req
 in here.                       

631
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:25,910
                   Nice.        

632
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:27,311
                           What?
                   What?        

633
00:29:27,313 --> 00:29:29,313
                I can't find it.

634
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:32,949
     I mean, I guess if you     
     don't need two nudes today,
     I can leave.               

635
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:35,818
           Oh, n-n-- Okay, okay.
           I know what.         

636
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,787
 Yeah. 'Cause I-- I do need     
 both-- both of-- both models.

      if it wasn't on top of me.

640
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:50,463
   I would forget <i>my</i> head       
   if it wasn't on top of me.

       I don't know             
       if you know that.        
       Oh, okay.

   I'll, uh...                  
   I'll get the class ready.    

647
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:13,446
So, what's                      
your name again?

650
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,785
With a C.                       
Pretty gay, huh?                

651
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:22,921
                      [chuckles]
                      Yeah.     

652
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:26,591
Look, dude, if you're worried   
about me looking at your dick,  
I can turn around.              

653
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:29,293
But, I mean, don't sweat it.    
You're not my type.             

654
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,894
                     I'm not?   

655
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:34,631
No. Should you be?              
           No, I guess not.     

656
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:38,468
I mean, you're hot and all,     
but I like guys                 
who can take charge.            

657
00:30:40,003 --> 00:30:43,804
Plus, your hair is too dark.    
And you're too tall.            

658
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:46,139
                 [chuckles]     
                 Gee, thanks.   

659
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:49,976
Just being honest with you.     
I think it's great-- types.     

660
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:53,178
I mean, if we all wanted        
the same thing,                 
might as well be straight.      

661
00:30:54,847 --> 00:30:57,648
        Maybe not everyone knows
        what their type is.     

662
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,450
     True enough.               

663
00:31:00,452 --> 00:31:02,718
There was this one guy...       

664
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,320
This sounds stupid,             
but when I met him,             

665
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:09,223
I sort of saw something         
in his soul, like a light.      

666
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:12,492
And physically,                 
he was nothing like any         
of the guys I dated before.     

667
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:16,595
But when I saw that light,      
I realized...                   

668
00:31:16,597 --> 00:31:19,030
this is my type, too.           

669
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:21,532
I asked him out, eventually.    

670
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,066
                    That's deep.

671
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:24,734
        Fuck you.               

672
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:26,969
              No, I'm serious.  
              That's...         

673
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:29,104
           So, whatever happened
           to your soul man?    

674
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:32,006
Doesn't matter.                 

675
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:35,542
Anyway, that's...               

676
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:37,210
ancient history.                

677
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:40,680
Hey, you need                   
a workout buddy?                

678
00:31:40,682 --> 00:31:42,114
                           Yeah.

679
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:44,749
 <i>[Kyle]</i>                         
 <i>This feels horrible.</i>           

680
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:47,785
Stop shaking                    
your ass so much.               
  No, I mean lying to Troy.     

681
00:31:47,787 --> 00:31:51,321
Honey, men lie.                 
And you're a man, technically.  

682
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:53,323
     Well, tonight,             
     you better not forget to...

683
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,325
                      Fuck!     
Oh, honey, I never              
forget to fuck.                 

684
00:31:55,327 --> 00:31:56,693
            No, "fuck," as in...

685
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:58,027
                           Kyle.

686
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:01,096
Well, hey, boys,                
what's up?                      

687
00:32:01,098 --> 00:32:03,131
                     Oh, you two
                     know Marc? 

688
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:05,133
I used to have                  
a big crush on Kyle.            

689
00:32:05,135 --> 00:32:08,035
Didn't I?                       
               But he's not     
               your type at all.

690
00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:10,470
           So, how do you two   
           know each other?     

691
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,538
We got naked together           
last night.                     
                     What?      

692
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,706
             Yeah, we both model
             for Mr. Thompson.  

693
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,774
Ah. Well, he's a regular        
Gus Van Sant.                   

694
00:32:16,776 --> 00:32:18,274
               Can I talk to you
               for a second?    

695
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:22,611
You haven't fucked him yet.     

696
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:24,479
  Hey, I don't treat people     
  like pieces of meat.          

697
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:25,880
   Well, you should.            
   It's fun.                    

698
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:28,048
You do know                     
he's gay, right?                

699
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,884
      Oh, God, I'm sorry.       
      Is that against the rules?

700
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:32,819
Dude, that's the only           
fucking rule!                   

701
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:36,255
Keep away from hot gay guys     
unless they have girlfriends    
like me.                        

702
00:32:36,257 --> 00:32:40,491
       Okay, okay. Well,        
       don't queen out about it.

703
00:32:40,493 --> 00:32:42,659
             Besides, he told me
             I'm not his type.  

704
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,193
And you believed him?           

705
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,663
I bet he told you he saw        
a light in your soul, too.      

706
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:50,033
 Kyle, I think your girlfriend's
 getting jealous.               

707
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,735
       Oh, please.              
       She trusts me completely.

708
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,505
       We're stronger than ever.
In fact, we were just           
about to...fuck.                

709
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,240
                         Whoa.  
 Really?                        

710
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:02,510
Yeah. I can hardly              
keep my fingers off             
his big, hard stick,            

711
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:04,111
especially when he's all...     
[inhales sharply]               

712
00:33:04,113 --> 00:33:05,846
sweaty from power walking.      

713
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,949
                       I'll bet.
 Go for it.                     

714
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:10,216
What?                           

715
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:13,185
Stick your hand                 
in his shorts.                  

716
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:14,786
Get him hard.                   
                        Yeah.   

717
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:18,022
            No way.             
What? Aren't you                
straight anymore?               

718
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:20,524
     Of course I'm straight.    
     I just don't think parading

719
00:33:20,526 --> 00:33:23,360
       my heterosexuality around
       in public is very polite.

720
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:26,463
           Well, then, how about
           you two just kiss?   

721
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,798
Yeah, that'd be hot.            
                        Yeah.   

722
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,032
            A kiss.             

723
00:33:30,034 --> 00:33:31,967
And use some tongue.            

724
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,202
Unless you don't like           
kissing your girlfriend.        

725
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:36,204
       Oh, I love kissing       
       my girlfriend.           

726
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:37,705
  Prove it.                     

727
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:41,375
       Oh, why should...        

728
00:33:44,912 --> 00:33:46,779
                            Wow.

729
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:53,584
            You two, get a room.
            Invite me over.     

730
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:56,720
[car approaching]               

731
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:58,822
[tires screech]                 

732
00:33:59,824 --> 00:34:02,425
Kyle?                           
                            Mom?

733
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:04,360
Kyle!                           

734
00:34:04,362 --> 00:34:07,396
What are you doing here?        
     I was just running errands.

735
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:11,232
          Oh, baby, this is more
          than I could ever     
          have hoped for!       

736
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:14,301
              This is wonderful!
          [chuckling]           

737
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,969
          You are a girl, right?

738
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,571
Mom, of course she's a girl.    
Would you please                
stop hugging me?                

739
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:21,607
We hadn't told her yet.         
           You don't understand.

740
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:25,110
        I used to catch this boy
        masturbating with every 
        vegetable in the fridge.

741
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:27,145
               And now this! Oh!

742
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:30,148
      Have you told that awful  
      ex-boyfriend of yours yet?

743
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,116
Mom, I have a feeling           
that he already knows.          

744
00:34:32,118 --> 00:34:34,318
I have a feeling                
this is the funniest thing      
he's ever seen.                 

745
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,621
 Well, I have a feeling that    
 the childish things that he's  
 doing are acts of jealousy.    

746
00:34:37,623 --> 00:34:40,423
  In some small way,            
  it's nice to know             
  that he cares for a change.   

747
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:44,627
     Who gives a shit about him?
     I'm gonna be a grandma!    

748
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,730
       This is war!             
       Marc is gonna rue the day
       he ever messed with me!  

749
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:50,132
Wow, you almost seem            
like a top.                     
          Marc thinks he can get

750
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:52,634
   whatever he wants            
   just by taking his shirt off.

751
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:56,571
 Maybe some guys don't want     
 a hot, muscular stud who's     
 confident with their sexuality.

752
00:34:56,573 --> 00:35:00,607
Maybe some people think         
it's charming enough to pretend 
that you're sexually conflicted.

753
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,843
             Some people like...
             Octavio.           

754
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:05,611
Octo-what?                      

755
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:08,847
         Oh, hi, honey.         
         I'm Tiffani.           

756
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:11,683
The rhinoceros?                 
           Excuse me?           

757
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:14,986
        Tiffani, this is Octavio
        from that group that I  
        was telling you about.  

758
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,054
        Mmm. Rhinoceros?        

759
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:19,089
          I'll call you tonight.

760
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:21,324
    Good luck                   
    not fucking each other.     

761
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:25,160
                    So, Octavio.

762
00:35:25,162 --> 00:35:27,228
[corrects pronunciation]        
Octavio.                        
                        Octavio.

763
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,231
It's like you're saying         
a V and V at the same time.     

764
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:32,366
Octavio.                        
                      "B and B"?

765
00:35:32,368 --> 00:35:34,034
V and V.                        

766
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:36,369
                So, what are you
                doing here?     

767
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:40,072
Your girlfriend's sexy.         
           Thanks.              

768
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:43,308
Nothing like I expected.        
    So what are you saying?     
    I'm not good enough for her?

769
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,644
           No, I just...        
           I didn't believe you.

770
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:49,880
 Something about you            
 screamed single...and lonely.  

771
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:51,882
           Well, as you can see,
           I'm clearly not.     

772
00:35:51,884 --> 00:35:53,617
And horny.                      

773
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,285
                     Horny.     

774
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,854
                 You're-- You're
                 hitting on me. 
Yes, I am.                      

775
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:58,921
                  [mouths words]

776
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,656
        What about Homo No More?

777
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,324
           I thought they       
           straightened you out.

778
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,259
    Yeah, but when I            
    saw you at the meeting,     

779
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:06,361
  I sort of fell off my wagon.  

780
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:09,731
         Well, you didn't really
         have that far to fall. 
Shut up.                        

781
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:11,899
I must have you.                

782
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:14,668
      I have a feeling that this
      is against the rules.     

783
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,405
It's okay. That bossy guy,      
Jacob, he breaks the rules      
all the time.                   

784
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,940
              Wait. Jacob's gay?
         Of course.             

785
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:22,942
  One time he followed me       
  into the bathroom at school   

786
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:25,678
  and started tapping his toes  
  underneath the stall.         

787
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,281
Anyways,                        
enough about him.               

788
00:36:31,917 --> 00:36:33,918
Your lips taste                 
like cherry.                    

789
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,986
            It's my girlfriend's
            lip gloss.          

790
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,791
                 Oh, Octavio.   
[corrects pronunciation]        
Octavio.                        

791
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:48,631
             Well, I'm this way.
             Thanks for the jog.

792
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:51,400
Cool. Hey, you wanna            
come over tonight?              

793
00:36:51,402 --> 00:36:54,302
        Uh, no, I can't.        
        I'm gonna watch the game
        with Kyle and Tiffani.  

794
00:36:54,304 --> 00:36:57,538
  Oh. Well, you guys have fun.  

795
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,473
             Hey, you wanna     
             jog again tomorrow?

796
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:02,776
     Maybe late afternoon?      
     We can hang out afterwards.

797
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:05,044
That'd be great.                
                   Cool.        

798
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:15,219
That's how we gays do it.       

799
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:19,723
                   Hey, w-wasn't
                   that awesome?

800
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:21,391
          Yeah.                 

801
00:37:22,393 --> 00:37:24,560
     Kyle made his mom so happy.

802
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:34,902
    What could they             
    possibly have in common     

803
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:36,737
        besides wanting         
        to be straight?         

804
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:39,439
Well, they both have dicks      
that haven't been sucked today. 

805
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,573
         Thanks, Gwen.          

806
00:37:40,575 --> 00:37:42,675
You have nothing                
to worry about.                 

807
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,045
Kyle's nonthreatening.          
He's like...soy milk            

808
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:49,281
or something you use            
when you run out of normal milk.

809
00:37:49,283 --> 00:37:52,250
And you're cream--              
gay cream.                      

810
00:37:52,252 --> 00:37:54,452
                 Ew.            
Hold still!                     

811
00:37:54,454 --> 00:37:56,654
        What's up with          
        all the drawing?        

812
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:58,822
   I don't know.                

813
00:37:58,824 --> 00:38:01,357
I like it.                      
I'm kind of good at it.         

814
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,858
          Since when?           

815
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,093
      Since now.                

816
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,562
I think I found my calling.     

817
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,031
    I barely think              
    about sex anymore.          

818
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:12,333
  I just wanna draw it.         

819
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:14,835
    That's so not like you.     

820
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:17,504
And you being all jealous       
isn't like you, either.         

821
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:21,574
   Look, it's simple.           
   Troy is a blank canvas.      

822
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:23,609
     No, he's a sketch.         

823
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:26,678
He's got all these lame ideas   
about what being gay is like,   

824
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,148
but he needs you to come in     
and provide the horny details.  

825
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,884
             Ha-ha.             
And before you know it...       

826
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,621
    fine art.                   

827
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:41,391
[grunting]

                 <i>Fucking shit!</i>  

829
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:46,329
         Come on, motherfuckers!
         We can win this!       

830
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:50,466
Kyle, 48 points behind          
with less than a minute to go.  

831
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:52,468
                       Oh.

832
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,303
           That was             
           actually fun, though.

833
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:56,004
                I mean, it sucks
                that we lost.   

834
00:38:56,006 --> 00:38:58,773
Aw, you'll get over it.         

835
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:01,542
Um, so how was your day?        

836
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:03,443
                     Strange.   

837
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:06,212
        But, you know, there was
        something that I wanted 
        to talk to you about.   

838
00:39:06,214 --> 00:39:10,049
       Something I didn't share 
       with the group yesterday.

839
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:14,820
       I didn't exactly         
       go cold salami when I    
       decided to turn straight.

840
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:17,989
      There were a few slip-ups.
While you were with Tiffani.    

841
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:20,324
              Well, yeah.       
              And she's great,  

842
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:23,894
         because she understands
         how pent-up feelings   

843
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:27,931
   can just explode if you don't
   do anything about 'em.       

844
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:32,502
    So, it's-- it's okay        
    if one of us makes a mistake
    every once in a while.      

845
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,705
     You know, we've even talked
     about the possibility of...

846
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,841
           playing...together.  

847
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,376
What, like a three-way?         
                    Yeah.       

848
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:44,011
Yeah. I had a three-way once.   

849
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:46,380
                           What?
Yeah, with two girls.           

850
00:39:46,382 --> 00:39:48,515
        Oh. I guess that counts.

851
00:39:48,517 --> 00:39:50,850
     Barely.                    

852
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:53,786
We were in this empty farmhouse 
outside of town.                

853
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:56,188
It was going great,             
you know.                       

854
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,123
They had me in the middle.      
We were kissing.                

855
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:01,626
And then they                   
pulled their panties down       
and pushed me downtown,         

856
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:03,394
and that's when things          
started to fall apart.          

857
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,028
          So you didn't like it?

858
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:10,132
Well, it wasn't                 
doing much for me.              
Does that make me gay?          

859
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,701
     Well, lots of straight guys
     don't like eating pussy.   

860
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:16,371
          I mean, they complain 
          about it all the time.
          So what happened next?

861
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:19,407
Well, the situation             
got worse.                      

862
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:22,143
I couldn't, you know.           

863
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:25,913
I couldn't find their clits.    
                   You couldn't?

864
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:28,515
Or G-spots or whatever.         

865
00:40:28,517 --> 00:40:31,084
I was down there forever.       
It was embarrassing.            

866
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:33,152
They laughed at me.             

867
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:36,588
And one of them even called me  
the Susan Lucci                 
of tongue fucking.              

868
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,057
Seventeen attempts              
and no clit.                    

869
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:41,726
           I know where it's at.
You do?                         

870
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:44,061
                     Yeah.      
Well, could you show me?        

871
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:47,297
                  Show you?     
How do you find it              
on Tiffani?                     

872
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:51,066
               How am I supposed
               to show you that?
I don't know. Use your fingers. 

873
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:55,369
          How about I use yours?

874
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,571
       You know, so you can feel
       what I'm doing.          

875
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:08,547
This is stupid.                 
                  No, come on.  
                  It'll be fun. 

876
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,782
               I'll show you    
               my whole routine.

877
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:15,052
 All right.                     
 [clears throat]                

878
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:20,991
               All right. First,

879
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:24,461
        you gotta start         
        with some little teases.

880
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:30,132
               Breathe on it.   

881

882
00:41:36,172 --> 00:41:39,440
           And then, you just...

883
00:41:39,442 --> 00:41:43,143
[laughing]                      
        Which is usually not    
        the reaction that I get.

884
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:46,279
No, it's-- it's good.           
It's-- It's good.               

885
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:56,955
               In the middle    
               of all of this,  

886
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,890
                of course,      

887
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:01,125
             is the love button.

888
00:42:02,227 --> 00:42:06,463
          But most girls go nuts
          if you just...        

889
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:08,465
                  dive on in.   

890
00:42:44,868 --> 00:42:46,368
                That's good.    

891
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,903
             That's really good.

892
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:54,274
Sorry I missed the game, guys.  
What the hell?                  

893
00:42:54,276 --> 00:42:57,543
         I was just showing Troy
         some tips on the art   
         of cunnilingus.        

894
00:42:57,545 --> 00:42:59,011
Not that I need 'em.            

895
00:42:59,013 --> 00:43:01,380
Even Melissa Etheridge could    
learn a thing or two from Kyle. 

896
00:43:01,382 --> 00:43:03,115
I gotta get going.              

897
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,717
Oh, stay.                       
There's plenty to eat.          
     Yeah, you don't have to go.

898
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,919
                Uh, I gotta     
                call it a night.

899
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:11,455
                 Thanks for, um,
                 time, Kyle.    

900
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,695
  Did you see that?             
  One more session like that,   
  and he's gonna explode.       

901
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:21,263
     Yeah, if he doesn't explode
     with Marc first.           

902
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,434
     [yells]                    
     I win!                     

903
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,735
[chuckling]                     
Oh.                             

904
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:31,071
             What?              

905
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,608
     So, uh, when did you first 
     know for sure you were gay?

906
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,242
      Mmm. Just now.            

907
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:42,646
No, I had my suspicions         
when I was, like, 12 or 13.     

908
00:43:42,648 --> 00:43:45,415
But I didn't know for sure      
until a couple years later      

909
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:47,917
    when I went down            
    on my first guy.            

910
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:50,085
It's the best thing             
that's ever happened to me.     

911
00:43:50,087 --> 00:43:51,453
             What? Being gay?   

912
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:53,154
          Yeah.                 

913
00:43:53,156 --> 00:43:56,123
Imagine that you think you're   
gonna live your life one way--  

914
00:43:56,125 --> 00:44:00,593
you get a job, you get married, 
get a three-bedroom house--     

915
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:04,930
and then you discover           
this...thing about yourself.    

916
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:09,200
It opens up a million           
new options as to how           
you can live your life.         

917
00:44:09,202 --> 00:44:11,202
Suddenly, you don't have        
those milestones                

918
00:44:11,204 --> 00:44:14,138
that straight people have       
to compare each other against.  

919
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,340
    You can...choose            
    your own adventure.         

920
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:19,709
             I love those books.

921
00:44:19,711 --> 00:44:22,478
      Me, too.                  
          But aren't you worried

922
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,013
         you'll end up all alone
         and not have           
         any of those things?   

923
00:44:25,015 --> 00:44:28,116
    Doesn't everyone?           
    Gay or straight?            

924
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:32,386
Sprint you home.                

925
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:37,389
                [panting]       

926
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:42,961
   And just so you know,        
   Kyle's mom's reaction        

927
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:44,996
   to him being straight        
   wasn't awesome.              

928
00:44:44,998 --> 00:44:46,998
                     Huh?       
           Well,                

929
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,933
     you said it like           
     you were happy for them.   

930
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:51,035
      Like that's the way       
      it should be.             

931
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:53,203
  My parents are totally cool   
  with me being gay.            

932
00:44:53,205 --> 00:44:55,338
      Yeah, but are your parents
      really okay with it?      

933
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,040
        I bet Kyle's mom        
        grew to be okay with it.

934
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:00,409
              But you saw       
              how happy she was.

935
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:02,978
     And that's what parents    
     really want for their kids.

936
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,480
     If you ask,                
     most parents will say      

937
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:08,182
   they just want their kids    
   to be happy.                 

938
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:11,084
   And maybe my mom             
   would be happier if I put    
   my dick somewhere else.      

939
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:15,054
 But you've seen those ex-gays. 
 Is that happy?                 

940
00:45:16,222 --> 00:45:18,456
    [sighs]                     
    If your parents love you    

941
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,858
and they think you're happy,    
they'll adjust.                 

942
00:45:22,293 --> 00:45:25,194
   I don't think my parents     
   would adjust to me being gay.

943
00:45:25,196 --> 00:45:28,230
    <i>They</i> shouldn't have         
    anything to do with it.     

944
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:31,933
You have to be who you are.     
It's the only way               
you can live with yourself.     

945
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:35,869
And it's the only way           
I can live at all.              

946
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:39,405
Did you wanna take a shower?    

947
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:42,141
        Talk about getting <i>my </i>  
        <i>creative juices flowing.</i>

948
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:45,711
I didn't know                   
you were here.                  
            Wait. Keep 'em down.

949
00:45:45,713 --> 00:45:47,646
                Would you boys  
                let me draw you?

950
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:49,214
               What, together?  

951
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:52,784
        No, right where you are.
        Right now.              

952
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:55,920
       I'll call it <i>Proposition.</i>

953
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:58,289
           What do you think?   
             I don't know. It...

954
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:02,259
It's this or renting a movie.   
Choose your own adventure.      

955
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,530
     When I walked in on the two
     of you, I was, like,       

956
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,999
    "Fuck this                  
    drawing-one-person-at-a-time
    shit.                       

957
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:13,468
    If I can capture the tension
    between these two"...       

958
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:18,172
              There was tension?
   Honey, it was more tense than
   Star Jones in a training bra.

959
00:46:18,174 --> 00:46:21,074
             Now, make that look
             you had--          

960
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:24,109
  surprised, a little turned-on,
  kind of scared.               

961
00:46:25,544 --> 00:46:27,878
               No. I don't know.

962
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,981
       Stare at Marc's crotch   
       and imagine what he could
       do to you with that.     

963
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:33,282
              Trust me,         
              he could do a lot.

964
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,853
                     Perfect.   

965
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:41,623
          So, uh, you two dated?

966
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:45,326
Gwen was my last girlfriend.    
          And Marc was my first.

967
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:49,696
              After him,        
              all I ever wanted 
              to date were fags.

968
00:46:49,698 --> 00:46:52,298
        I've got an idea.       
        This could take forever,

969
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,301
     and I see the potential for
     something more interesting.

970
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:59,137
             Could I do a series
             with you guys?     

971
00:46:59,139 --> 00:47:03,107
     Almost like a story        
     that starts with this scene
     and goes from there.       

972
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:04,875
              What do you think?
                   I don't know.

973
00:47:04,877 --> 00:47:07,844
            If I said,          
            "Pose with a woman,"
            you'd totally do it.

974
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:10,847
It's not like we'd even         
have time to pose for a series. 

975
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:13,749
      I'll take photos          
      and use them to draw from.

976
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:15,684
      Come on.                  
      We can be done in minutes,

977
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:18,186
              depending how well
              you two...connect.

978
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:22,123
Yeah, but Troy                  
feels uncomfortable.            

979
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:25,659
             No. I'll do it.    

980
00:47:25,661 --> 00:47:29,061
Perfect.                        
I'll get my camera.             

981
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,562
         You sure?              

982
00:47:31,997 --> 00:47:34,298
                        Yeah.   

983
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,000
      Choose your own adventure.

984
00:47:37,002 --> 00:47:40,536
   Okay, Troy, sit back down.   
   Marc, off with the pants.    

985
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,741
                   [beeps]      
                   Perfect.     

986
00:47:46,743 --> 00:47:50,211
Okay, Troy,                     
stand back up with Marc.        

987
00:47:50,213 --> 00:47:53,414
          I want you to do      
          that same character   
          you were doing.       

988
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:57,850
         Like he's a virgin     
         and he wants it,       
         but he's confused.     

989
00:47:57,852 --> 00:48:01,253
          Can you do that?      
      Yeah.                     

990
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:04,589
        So, Marc, honey,        
        why don't you           
        get down on one knee    

991
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:07,358
          and put your hands    
          underneath...         

992
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,094
Yeah, that.                     
[camera beeps]                  

993
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:13,864
    Actually,                   
    raise the shirt a little    
    and lift your head          

994
00:48:13,866 --> 00:48:15,999
       so you're looking        
       into his eyes.           

995
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,900
[camera beeps]                  

996
00:48:17,902 --> 00:48:20,869
  Look like you're in the moment
  and you want it.              

997
00:48:20,871 --> 00:48:22,904
            [beeps]             

998
00:48:22,906 --> 00:48:25,539
Marc, I want you to stand       
and take Troy's...              

999
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,608
Yeah, that.                     
[camera beeps]                  

1000
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:30,776
Now, Troy,                      
the removal of the shirt        

1001
00:48:30,778 --> 00:48:33,111
is one of                       
the hottest moments.            

1002
00:48:33,113 --> 00:48:36,880
When you know soon              
you'll be skin on skin,         

1003
00:48:36,882 --> 00:48:39,082
        chest on chest,         

1004
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:41,617
         lips on lips.          

1005
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,686
                 [camera beeps] 
     Marc, toss the shirt aside.

1006
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,255
       Marc, lick one of        
       Troy's nipples.          

1007
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,624
                Don't worry.    
                It'll feel good.

1008
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:56,963
Yeah. I-- I know.               

1009
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:04,703
                [camera beeping]

1010
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:10,574
        Troy, run your left hand
        through Marc's hair.    

1011
00:49:11,676 --> 00:49:13,677
                  [camera beeps]

1012
00:49:14,912 --> 00:49:17,146
      Marc, hold it right there.

1013
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:21,182
             Troy, pull Marc in.

1014
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:23,517
                  [camera beeps]

1015
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:25,285
                Yeah.           

1016
00:49:25,287 --> 00:49:27,520
                  [camera beeps]

1017
00:49:27,522 --> 00:49:32,724
            Marc, lick his chest
            up to his neck.     

1018
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:34,358
                  [camera beeps]

1019
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:38,127
          [Gwen]                
          How you feeling, Troy?

1020
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:42,697
Really, really good.            

1021
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:44,698
      Then throw your head back.

1022
00:49:46,534 --> 00:49:48,201
            [grunts]            
            Sorry.              

1023
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:50,102
            It's perfect.       
            Stay right there.   

1024
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:53,671
Marc, make like you're          
kissing your way down.          

1025
00:49:53,673 --> 00:49:57,074
[camera beeping]                

1026
00:50:00,111 --> 00:50:02,045
How 'bout I do this?            

1027
00:50:02,047 --> 00:50:04,547
This is hot, right?             
                      God, yeah.

1028
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:06,315
    You're a natural, Troy.     

1029
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:08,550
                [camera beeps]  
                Close your eyes.

1030
00:50:08,552 --> 00:50:13,420
Marc, move down between his legs
and kiss his stomach.           

1031
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:15,822
        [camera beeping]        

1032
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,925
   Now, Marc, get up            
   so that you're on top of him,

1033
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:22,060
                   face-to-face.

1034
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,732
          You can open your eyes
          if you want.          

1035
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:31,568
      Hold that pose.           
      Like you're about to kiss.

1036
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,571
       One of those first kisses

1037
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,540
              that takes forever
              before you meet.  

1038
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,675
                Moving closer...

1039
00:50:40,977 --> 00:50:43,177
                     and closer.

1040
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:46,513
                [camera beeping]

1041
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:48,581
                           Shit!
               What?            

1042
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,684
           My card's full.      
           Hey, look, I wanna   
           keep this going.     

1043
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:53,419
   You're fine with that, right?
Uh-huh.                         

1044
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,087
         I'll just go upload 'em
         in my room.            

1045
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:58,090
          It'll take 15 minutes.
          Hold that pose.       

1046
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:06,030
I'll be in my room.             
With the door closed.           

1047
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,500
                   [door closes]

1048
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:14,536
      I...don't think I can stay
      like this for 15 minutes. 

1049
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,305
Me, either.                     

1050
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,711
I-- I know                      
I'm not your type, but...       

1051
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:27,714
            And I'm not a girl, 
            but we'll improvise.

1052
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:46,798
           [moaning]            

1053
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,766
    Oh, that feels so good.     
    [moans]                     

1054
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:51,968
          I'm gonna...          
          I'm gonna...

           [grunting]           

1056
00:52:05,848 --> 00:52:07,181
                            Wow.

1057
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:10,884
                That was...fast.

1058
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:14,220
I'm sorry. It's--               
It's been a while.              

1059
00:52:14,222 --> 00:52:17,423
Plus, I--                       
I haven't gotten it             
like that before.               

1060
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:21,793
    Like that--                 
    meaning with a guy          
    or meaning it was that good?

1061
00:52:21,795 --> 00:52:25,096
                Here, let me    
                get you a towel.
 No, wait.                      

1062
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:26,764
            My turn.

                   Sorry. Sorry.

00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,308
           [moans]              
           It's okay.           

1067
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:43,611
         Oh, yeah! Oh!

00:52:43,613 --> 00:52:47,014
          [straining]           
          Oh, yeah!             

1069

             [grunts]           
             All right.         

1070

              [sighing]         

1071
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:53,987
Am I not                        
doing it right?                 

1072
00:52:53,989 --> 00:52:56,923
              No, you were fine.
              I just...         

1073
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,593
               No, I just can't.

1074
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:03,629
Fuck! Why am I so bad           
at giving oral sex?             

1075
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:07,298
       No, you were doing great.
       I just...                

1076
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,300
                      I'm sorry.

1077
00:53:10,735 --> 00:53:13,136
Is it because                   
I'm not your type?              

1078
00:53:13,138 --> 00:53:17,373
       Troy, you're hot,        
       trust me.                

1079
00:53:20,076 --> 00:53:24,479
Or, no, don't trust me.         

1080
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:30,751
Can you wait one minute?        

1081
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,157
These are hot.                  

1082
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:40,425
             I can't do it.     

1083
00:53:52,905 --> 00:53:55,506
But it's going                  
exactly how you wanted.         

1084
00:53:55,508 --> 00:53:58,642
             I just can't do it.

1085
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:01,878
     If Kyle wants              
     to pretend to be straight  
     just to have sex with Troy,

1086
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,614
         that's his prerogative.

1087
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,583
                I just can't    
                do this anymore.

1088
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,770
Well, can we at least           
finish the photo shoot?

[car departs]                   
                    Oh, great.  

1091
00:54:34,376 --> 00:54:37,043
           He's probably        
           freaking out about   
           making it with a guy.

1092
00:54:37,045 --> 00:54:40,780
He's probably                   
looking for someone             
who won't cock-tease him.       

1093
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:44,816
                    I know where
                    he's going. 

1094
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:47,885
             [sighs]            
             I fucked up.       
      What is it?               

1095
00:54:47,887 --> 00:54:50,487
     I had sex with a guy.      

1096
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:52,188
                    Was it Marc?

1097
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,690
Oh, my God!                     
That's horrible!                

1098
00:54:54,692 --> 00:54:55,957
        I know. It was.         

1099
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,092
It was?                         
                         It was?

1100
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,828
       I felt so guilty,        
       because...               

1101
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,830
   all I could do               
   was think about you, Kyle.   

1102
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:05,666
Really?                         
  Yeah. And how I let you down, 

1103
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:08,602
        and how I let           
        the group down,         

1104
00:55:08,604 --> 00:55:12,005
  and how, more than anything,  
  I just wanted to be           
  with a woman.                 

1105
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:13,373
      Or with a man and a woman.

1106
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:16,209
          I don't know.         
          It's so confusing.    

1107
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:18,311
       [sighs]                  
       And then I thought       
       of you two,              

1108
00:55:18,313 --> 00:55:21,480
and what good friends           
you've been to me,              

1109
00:55:21,482 --> 00:55:25,583
    and how honest and open     
    you've been about           
    your struggles, Kyle,       

1110
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:31,889
     and about how you two      
     have...an arrangement.     

1111
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:09,626
           Wait, wait.          
           Is this too weird?   

1112
00:56:09,628 --> 00:56:12,028
It's not too weird!             
             It's not too weird!

1113
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:33,114
    Ahhh!                       

1114
00:56:37,285 --> 00:56:39,252
           [panting]            
           Show me.             

1115
00:56:39,254 --> 00:56:41,854
Huh?                            
     Show me your routine.      

1116
00:56:42,922 --> 00:56:45,189
Oh. It's gonna go               
that far, huh?                  

1117
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:46,523
          Three-ways usually do.

1118
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:50,159
         I want you to teach me.

1119
00:56:50,161 --> 00:56:51,927
            Please? I need this.

1120
00:56:51,929 --> 00:56:56,064
            Well, why don't I do
            a little mouth magic
            on you first?       

1121
00:56:56,066 --> 00:56:59,567
     That'll get me all nice    
     and rolling out            
     the welcome mat down there.

1122
00:56:59,569 --> 00:57:02,202
       No. You two first.       

1123
00:57:02,204 --> 00:57:04,637
That way, it'll get me ready    
for what you're gonna do to me. 

1124
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:06,872
But you don't want              
sloppy seconds.                 

1125
00:57:06,874 --> 00:57:09,674
I mean,                         
company should go first.        

1126
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:23,119
                      [whimpers]

1127
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:31,893
                      [whimpers]

1128
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:34,629
              That is so hot.   
[nervous chuckle]               

1129
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:41,735
Oh, Kyle, eat me out already.   
The boy wants to see            
how it's done.                  

1130
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:44,871
           Please don't make me!
           Please don't make me!

1131
00:57:44,873 --> 00:57:46,639
                      [grunting]

1132
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:52,009
                 [lips smacking]

1133
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:54,378
           Oh, yeah.            

1134
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,080
      Oh, yes. That's it.       

1135
00:57:57,082 --> 00:58:00,249
        You can do it.          
        Make Mama proud.        

1136
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:03,552
  My God, it's like             
  the little homo that could.   

1137
00:58:03,554 --> 00:58:06,221
        Do you wanna            
        try now, please?        

1138
00:58:07,256 --> 00:58:09,590
            Troy?               
                    [Kyle gulps]

1139
00:58:09,592 --> 00:58:11,491
Where are you going?            
                       [gasps]  

1140
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,094
     Well, that certainly didn't
     taste like sugar and spice.

1141
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:18,297
Troy?                           
                What's going on?

1142
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:21,633
It's my pussy.                  
My pussy scared him away!       

1143
00:58:21,635 --> 00:58:24,569
You little ex-gay sluts!        

1144
00:58:24,571 --> 00:58:27,905
                     Oh, my God!

1145
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:30,173
Can we come in,                 
or were you in                  
the middle of dinner?           

1146
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:31,841
        What are you doing here?

1147
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:34,410
We're not eating pussy.         
What are the three of you doing?

1148
00:58:34,412 --> 00:58:36,345
      Well,                     
                         [gulps]

1149
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,280
Kyle was showing Troy           
the art of cunnilingus.         

1150
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:40,015
And he was doing                
an admirable job.               

1151
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:42,751
            Yeah, for a gay guy.

1152
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:46,688
       Yeah, I know. Everything.
       And you guys will do     
       anything to get laid.    

1153
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,558
        I ate pussy for nothing?

1154
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,693
                You deserved it.
       Hey!                     

1155
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,494
It wasn't that bad.             

1156
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:56,696
                   I'm sorry.   
                   I'm horrible.

1157
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:59,264
      We're all horrible.       

1158
00:59:00,866 --> 00:59:04,602
If it's any consolation,        
it wasn't just about the sex.   

1159
00:59:04,604 --> 00:59:07,037
We really liked you.            
    Working out with you.       

1160
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:09,873
              Watching the game.
Drawing you.                    

1161
00:59:09,875 --> 00:59:13,877
Well, it doesn't matter now.    
You think he's gonna wanna      
have anything to do with us?    

1162
00:59:13,879 --> 00:59:16,613
         Now, what the fucked-up
         thing is, even though  
         you lied to me         

1163
00:59:16,615 --> 00:59:20,282
            and to each other   
            and to people       
            you don't even know,

1164
00:59:21,284 --> 00:59:24,519
             I like you...liars.

1165
00:59:24,521 --> 00:59:27,054
We like you, too.               
           Yeah, you're so cool.

1166
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:31,291
  And I'm sorry.                
  I know I kind of led y'all on 
  with the whole confused thing.

1167
00:59:31,293 --> 00:59:34,727
Yeah, so, come on. You've       
sucked dick and eaten pussy.    
Which is it?                    

1168
00:59:34,729 --> 00:59:38,230
Well, that's what's been        
tripping me up all these years. 

1169
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:40,432
     I thought it had to be     
     one or the other.          

1170
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:42,800
   After sampling both,         
   I've come to a conclusion.   

1171
00:59:44,068 --> 00:59:46,903
                 I'm...bisexual.

1172
00:59:46,905 --> 00:59:48,905
[all together]                  
There's no such thing!          

1173
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:51,307
                       Says who?
   Uh, the laws of nature.      

1174
00:59:51,309 --> 00:59:53,342
It's like horses                
fucking gerbils.                

1175
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:56,578
          Well, then,           
          I'm a freak of nature,
          and I'm proud of it.  

1176
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,514
Good. Be proud, bi-boy.         

1177
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:01,516
         I wish you'd been proud
         when we met.           

1178
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:04,352
   Yeah, I guess that's hard    
   when people like <i>you</i>         

1179
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:07,021
  and Jacob Buchanan tell him   
  how bad it is to be gay.      

1180
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:10,090
                Yeah. I'm sorry.

1181
01:00:10,092 --> 01:00:12,459
          I should've helped you
          instead of trying     
          to take advantage     

1182
01:00:12,461 --> 01:00:15,061
of you not knowing              
what you were.                  

1183
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:17,829
So, what do we do now?          

1184
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:20,865
        We're gonna stop        
        people like me.         

1185
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,067
  No one should take advantage  
  of confused queer kids.       

1186
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:26,470
 And the sooner we help them    
 see past what it is            
 they don't like in themselves  

1187
01:00:26,472 --> 01:00:29,372
 so they can see all the great  
 things right in front of them, 

1188
01:00:30,374 --> 01:00:32,274
          the better.           

1189
01:00:35,111 --> 01:00:39,013
He's a homo who fucks things up 
for other homos.                
        I don't know if that's--

1190
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:42,349
Octavio, if people              
like him weren't around,        
everyone would come out.        

1191
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:44,351
You would get laid like that.   
[snaps fingers]                 

1192
01:00:44,353 --> 01:00:46,286
              Hmm.              
              I take your point.

1193
01:00:46,288 --> 01:00:48,721
          I'll do it.           
          And then we make love.

1194
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:56,326
                 Stop the spread
                 of faggotry.   

1195
01:00:56,328 --> 01:00:58,794
Wake up and smell the patchouli.
You're a dyke.                  

1196
01:01:00,696 --> 01:01:02,730
            Help!               
            I'm being recruited!

1197
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:10,802
Convince me                     
you didn't like that.           
Do your best.                   

1198
01:01:11,937 --> 01:01:15,205
             Look, I'm not gonna
             embrace who I am   

1199
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:17,173
             just because       
             it's obvious, okay?

1200
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:21,210
What?                           
              Everyone's so cool
              with being gay.

           <i>"Will and Grace</i> this,
           Clay Aiken that."    

1202
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:26,081
               Well, I'm not    
               gonna be labeled.

1203
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,516
You're not convincing me.       

1204
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:33,888
        Okay, I'm gay.          
        Now shut up and kiss me.

1205
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:37,024
I'm not gay.                    
          Then what do you want?

1206
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,960
I want us to make art.          

1207
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:48,134
               That is so...hot.

1208
01:01:49,136 --> 01:01:52,204
God, you are a lesbian.         

1209

[Kyle]                          
Mom?                            

1210
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:56,874
    What are you doing here?    

1211
01:01:56,876 --> 01:01:58,909
                   What's wrong?
           Nothing.             

1212
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,544
            No. What? I've never
            seen you this upset.

1213
01:02:03,046 --> 01:02:04,880
        [sniffles]              

1214
01:02:04,882 --> 01:02:07,983
I was at the beauty shop,       

1215
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:10,118
    and I was looking           
    through a magazine,         

1216
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,187
and I saw that the Oscars       
are coming up.                  

1217
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:16,890
   Well, I thought,

   the Oscars with?

and have kids,                  
for Christ's sake.

with my girlfriend,

01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:51,252

is our grandchildren.

  were fighting over Troy,

        you tapped into         
        some unknown confidence 
        none of us knew you had?

1374
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:08,474
   Yeah.                        

1375
01:12:08,476 --> 01:12:10,275

      and made some hot friends.

      I knew where he was going.

     when I had a problem

1390

do you think that               
you can find it in your heart   
to love somebody                

1391
01:13:01,082 --> 01:13:04,249

just to get laid?               

1392
01:13:04,251 --> 01:13:05,950
                   I don't know.

1393
01:13:05,952 --> 01:13:08,752
            Can you love someone
            who flirted with

                 your boyfriend?

1395
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:15,590
Can you love somebody           
whose last sexual act           
involved eating pussy?          

1396
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:19,226
      Can you love someone who--

1397
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,861
        Wait. Being a flirt     
        was my only flaw, right?

I don't know.

1399
01:13:24,131 --> 01:13:26,431
         You brushed your teeth,
         right?                 

1400
01:13:38,744 --> 01:13:42,212
     Does that turn you on      
     as much as I think it does?

1401
01:13:42,214 --> 01:13:43,713
   Yeah.                        

1402
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:46,716
But that doesn't mean           
I'm not open to new experiences.
