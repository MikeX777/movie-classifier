Presents

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,348
a film by

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,993
ROSE'S  SONGS

4
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,473
based on a real story

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,597
cast

6
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,873
photographed by

7
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,593
Who's Chaliapin?

8
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,868
What was that?

9
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,551
- Did you hear it? - Something got
knocked over in Mr. Rose's flat.

10
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,871
Dad's up there.
Who's Chaliapin?

11
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,988
Mr. Rose's friend.
An opera singer, too.

12
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,515
Russian.

13
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,669
When the war's over, you can fetch
Granny's old mirror. All right?

14
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,030
- All right.
- Come here...

15
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,397
You know he must eat,
or he won't sing.

16
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,518
Come on, put that cricket down.

17
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,958
Come and
try it on...

18
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,032
You'll sew one for Dad, too?

19
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,830
Of course,
I will.

20
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,149
We have to.

21
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,638
- Where's the salt?
- The salt?

22
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,238
Where do you think?
In the kitchen.

23
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,157
- Is that all?
- Why? Isn't that enough?

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,956
Ask Mrs. Bödõ then.

25
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,832
What do you think?

26
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,709
- Crap.
- Tomi, you mustn't say

27
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,716
such words.

28
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,713
Dad wants to take
a picture of you before you go.

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,513
What, with this?

30
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,397
We're late. I'll just take
the salt up to lmre.

31
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,629
Yes, with this.

32
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,638
- But it's such cra...
- Hush, I don't want to hear.

33
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,835
Now, off you go. The girls can't
wait to see your school report.

34
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,317
- I bet they can't.
- Can't they?

35
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,158
Go on, clever clogs.
Don't keep Dad waiting.

36
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,912
But give me his coat first.

37
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,391
Off you go!
Right a bit.

38
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,432
Stay there.
Come back.

39
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,432
You're too far away.
Come closer. Closer.

40
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,034
Hello.

41
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,510
I'm Mr. Waltz,
this is my family.

42
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,753
Good morning.

43
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,876
How do you do.
I'm Géza Halász.

44
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,874
I'm sorry to disturb you
Mr. Halász.

45
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,990
We're looking for Mr. Rose's villa.
Is this it?

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,436
Yes, this is it.
I'm a friend of lmre's.

47
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,712
Pleased to meet you.
Please tell Mr. Rose that

48
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,911
Waltz is here.
He knows about us.

49
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,435
Do come in, please
Mr. Waltz.

50
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,154
Mr. Rose always said
we could turn to him

51
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,033
if we needed help.

52
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,315
I never thought that
one day we'd have to.

53
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,433
We too are only guests -
for a year now. Since

54
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,391
I lost my job.
But, you know,

55
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,435
three kids are three kids. Imre's
gone up to the tower room to avoid them.

56
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,558
Well, children will
always be children.

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,513
Since March he hasn't even
come down to eat. Locked himself in.

58
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,833
I take him food and
clean clothes.

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,120
- Then I think we'd better go.
- No, no. You misunderstand me.

60
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,511
It'll all be fine.
Only I can't promise

61
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,959
lmre will come out of hiding.

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,276
Of course.
One must make allowances for

63
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,470
such a great artist.

64
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,194
Come on. My wife will help you
make yourselves at home.

65
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,596
- Hello.
- Hello.

66
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,395
I had to come, Mr. Halász.

67
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,549
My mistress had to go
to the countryside.

68
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,075
Come in, Maggie.
Can I help?

69
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,112
Don't call me Maggie, please.
It sounds so common.

70
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,152
Of course, you've told me before.
Won't happen again,

71
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,349
Miss Magda.

72
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,239
Oh, come now.
Don't...

73
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,794
Tomi and I are just off
to the school.

74
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,997
Get going then...
Where will I find Gran?

75
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,874
She was in the pantry
a minute ago.

76
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,388
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

77
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,193
Bye, Tomi.

78
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,592
- Good morning, Mr. Halász.
- Julo, your mum's

79
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,278
looking for you.

80
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,076
I'll be off then.
Have you seen my old man?

81
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,714
- No.
- I'll find him somewhere.

82
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,719
You know: "Matter is never lost,
only transformed". Who said that?

83
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,593
- Lavoisier?
- Yes! Lavoisier.

84
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,155
"Matter is never lost,
only transformed."

85
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,519
Let's hurry now, or we'll
never get that school report.

86
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,551
- No. No.
- Let's go!

87
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,948
I know he's a good lad, sweetheart.
But that's how it is these days.

88
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,914
Believe me, both Dad and I,
we only want the best for you.

89
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,271
- But we hardly ever meet.
- Even hardly ever is too much.

90
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,515
- Try to understand...
- What?

91
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,156
That it's best for everyone
if you don't meet for a while.

92
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,274
- But why? Why, mum?
- Because we're Jews,

93
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,715
and he is not.

94
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,316
He'll understand.
He's a bright boy.

95
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,038
I beg your pardon...

96
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,910
Tell your filthy brat to stop it!

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,790
Did you address me?

98
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,838
- Well, who else?
- Do we know each other?

99
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,838
I don't know any Jews!

100
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,398
Look! He's still making faces!

101
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,157
He is only seeing
how strong his lungs are.

102
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,118
How long he can hold his breath.
I gave him a watch

103
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,835
for his good school report...
Now he's experimenting...

104
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,316
It's not that bad, is it?

105
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,831
Making his Hungarian jacket dirty!

106
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,349
Pardon?

107
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,838
Take that star off!

108
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,949
But, Madam, it's compulsory
for us from today...

109
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,078
Compulsory?

110
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,633
Like stealing,
I suppose?

111
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,399
That's compulsory for you lot,
too, isn't it?

112
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,710
Hitler'll see to the likes of you.
He knows what to do with you!

113
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,317
These soldiers are not here to see
to us... There's a war on,

114
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,349
Madam.

115
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,597
They'll turn you into soap!
And your filthy Jewish brat, too!

116
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,670
Then that was from
a cake of soap, Madam.

117
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,432
He hit me! Did you see? He hit me!
The filthy Jew!

118
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,518
Do something!

119
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,629
<i>Did you see?</i>

120
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,910
<i>Do something!</i>
<i>Stop!</i>

121
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,269
You bastard!

122
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,073
<i>Catch him!</i>

123
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,109
<i>Stop him!</i>

124
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,359
<i>You bastard!</i>

125
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,797
I'm very proud of you.

126
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,958
What did you do in town?

127
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,394
Did Dad take you to eat cakes
with that nice Auntie Olga?

128
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,952
I put the Waltzes in the ironing
room. I thought I'd tell lmre.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,956
I knocked, but he didn't
even answer.

130
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,395
He doesn't like to be disturbed,
I've told you.

131
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,638
- I only knocked.
- What are you doing?

132
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,395
I'm trying to make paper the colour
of this Bible's.

133
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,351
It's beautiful.
Whose is it?

134
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,636
Lmre gave it to me - to sell if we
need to. It's worth 1,000 pengõs.

135
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,438
Did you tell Skubala
to come in the morning?

136
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,599
And what shall we say to Father?
The first thing he'll do will be

137
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,233
- to look for lmre. - He'll understand.
Imre doesn't want to see anybody.

138
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,673
Have you been up to him?

139
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,589
Have you been?

140
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,753
He just lies and
looks at the ceiling...

141
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,558
And why does he need the salt?

142
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,512
For the smell of the sea.

143
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,319
But a whole sack?

144
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,669
He lies on it to feel the infinite.

145
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,596
And won't he ever practise again?

146
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:01,037
King of Rikitiki! He arrive in Europe!
Home of industrious peoples!

147
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,558
Julo a real lady.

148
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,835
Where's Tomi?
I not see.

149
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,389
Sarah! You see this?

150
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,116
Lmre's sworn that he's not coming out
until these rats have been

151
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,673
cleared out of Budapest.

152
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,789
What you telling me?
What you mean?

153
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,673
That you won't meet him, Father.

154
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,599
Bad! I understand!

155
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,559
Bad. Very bad.

156
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,349
I'm not sure yet.
Perhaps for your sake

157
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,314
I may be able to persuade him.

158
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,517
Sarah, you hear?
Rose no sing.

159
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,550
Nu, this is bad.
Very bad.

160
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,356
I bring his favourite tea.

161
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,760
Mr. Halász,
could I have a word with you?

162
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,237
Of course, coming. Have your
breakfast, I'll be back

163
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,235
in a minute.

164
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,673
Good day.

165
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,709
Thank you, my son.

166
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,228
Go home.

167
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,111
<i>Tomi, where are you?</i>

168
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,269
- He's always wandering off.
- You've grown a lot, my boy.

169
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,194
- Grandpa!
- Come, my boy.

170
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,556
Have you spoken to
the child, Mr. Halász?

171
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,391
If you mean Julo, then yes,
I have, Mr. Skubala.

172
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,154
They went cycling again yesterday.

173
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,995
They're fond of each other.
Arpad's a good lad.

174
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,352
Times have changed. Understand?
Don't worry. I understand.

175
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,351
Look, I'm not like that.

176
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,832
We're poor, very poor.

177
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,668
Just don't let the children meet.

178
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,078
Don't worry, they won't.
I give you my word.

179
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,191
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- That's all I wanted.

180
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,391
All the best, Mr. Halász.
Give my regards to Mr. Rose.

181
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,908
I'll pass them on.

182
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,157
Pass the milk, please.

183
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,509
Here it is.

184
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,996
- All right.
- Just a little.

185
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,595
- Fine.
- Thanks.

186
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,999
Ugh!
That's not mine.

187
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,877
Sorry, I haven't unpacked
yours yet... I thought

188
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,273
this would do...
I'll go and get it.

189
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,715
Pour away, please.

190
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,955
Sloosht.

191
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,512
Nu, you read.
What be written there?

192
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,551
- Segesvár... 1849...
- Sarah's papa fought

193
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,159
in the battle there.
Read on.

194
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:27,114
- Lemberg, 1811.
- Lemberg.

195
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,598
Sarah's grandpa was there.

196
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,955
Zsuzsõ...

197
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,674
Give me bacon, please.

198
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,552
Mr. Skubala gave it to us.

199
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,148
The best type.

200
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,477
Father, have some bread with it,
you'll be sick.

201
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:10,916
Oh, Sarah, my dear wife.
Kosher is what's good.

202
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,396
How much longer will it last,
Mr. Halász?

203
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,309
The BBC says a month or two...

204
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,308
A month or two, a year, a century,
a thousand years...

205
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,518
but a single second is
enough to kill someone.

206
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,197
De Gaulle's already in Paris...
Imre heard it on the radio.

207
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,670
Would you tell Mr. Rose that we
miss his voice very much.

208
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,271
If only he would practise sometimes.

209
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,549
He's not even willing to talk.

210
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,396
One can still sing
without saying the words.

211
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,794
It's very important to us.
Please tell him.

212
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,992
I will.

213
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,315
Hello.

214
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,109
I can't believe it!
Girls! Where's the salt?

215
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,436
- I've asked you something.
- I don't know.

216
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,631
- I don't know
- Tomi, what's all this now?

217
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,955
- Nothing.
- He's always doing it.

218
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,157
Where can it be?
I don't understand where it's gone.

219
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,910
Lili, my dear, we've got guests.

220
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,600
Good morning.
I'm Olga Fehér,

221
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,154
Géza's colleague.

222
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,838
Good morning. I'm Lili.
You must have heard of me.

223
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,031
- Of course.
- This is my sister.

224
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,315
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hello. I'm Vera.

225
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,834
Please forgive us. Mr. Halász has
said many times to me, to us,

226
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,274
- that if there's trouble...
- The Arrow Cross broke into

227
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,476
our home at dawn.

228
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,910
They rounded up all the women
from the flats in the courtyard.

229
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,594
Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,873
Hello, Tomi.

231
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,595
We've met already, haven't we.

232
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,350
- Tomi, say hello properly, please.
- If we push this dresser

233
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,915
in the middle,
it will divide the kitchen,

234
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,991
- won't it.
- Of course...

235
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,593
It would divide it, my dear.

236
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,114
Mr. Rose doesn't even come down
any more - just sends messages.

237
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,476
I don't know what will
come of this.

238
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,276
These poor people wouldn't have
any shoes if you didn't

239
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,514
mend them for them.

240
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,760
Well... everything will be alright.

241
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,990
What is it,
did you hear something?

242
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,798
Listen to the other side, quick.

243
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,273
Hands up.

244
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,511
Don't disturb us, Géza.

245
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,951
Take it.

246
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,878
- What?
- Take my gun.

247
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,789
Nu, gun?!
Not broom?

248
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,432
As we practised.

249
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,914
Why he take it?
There not be another?

250
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,474
Ladies and Gentlemen!
See David's fight

251
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,158
with Goliath!

252
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,990
See the real man strike first!

253
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,639
Come on, Tomi!
Grab it!

254
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,713
You give it to him!

255
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
Our life depends on this, Father.

256
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,112
Nu, you know!

257
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,709
I no talk!
You do that! Do, do.

258
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,353
Tamás, come on!

259
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,118
As we agreed...
We'll spot the weakest...

260
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,517
- Move.
- Géza!

261
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,790
You can't be such a coward...

262
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,628
Come on, let's show them.

263
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,558
Strike first and win.

264
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,637
What are you?
A coward, a stinking little Jew...

265
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,755
Did you see your mother?
She's got strength!

266
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,600
Did you see her?
That's how to do it, my boy!

267
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,235
To dance, to dance.

268
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,870
If you're ordered to go
to the ghetto, then you've got to

269
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,875
go to the ghetto.

270
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,310
Like cattle to the slaughter house.

271
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,751
- It's not yet the slaughter house.
- Right. Only the entrance to it.

272
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,032
I'm not going to give them my life.

273
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,394
What if they come here?

274
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,476
Oh, Géza, what's this again?

275
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,075
A brace.
It was my father's in the war.

276
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,116
Just tell me what you're going to do?

277
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,310
They'll come here,
say we disobeyed their order and

278
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,318
line us up against the wall.
What happens then?

279
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,716
I'll leave you alone,
only tell me what you'll do

280
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,118
if they want to kill us.

281
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,149
What will you say then?

282
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,348
I'm so scared.

283
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,514
It's all right...
Don't be afraid. I'm here with you.

284
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,719
Leave me alone.
Do you think I don't know?

285
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,070
What don't you know, darling?

286
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,590
- That she's your lover.
- Who?

287
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,595
Olga!

288
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,116
Don't, Géza.
The kids are still awake.

289
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,515
And so is Mrs. Bödõ.
And Magda.

290
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,478
- What about them?
- They, too, are my lovers.

291
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,957
Didn't you know? And Mrs. Waltz.
So? Give me your hand.

292
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,711
I'm serious, Géza.

293
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,438
So am I. Come on.
Give me your hand.

294
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,869
Can't you think of
anything else?

295
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,195
What has that got to
do with things?

296
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,437
A lot. An awful lot.
You can't imagine.

297
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,871
- Ah...
- Good morning, Mrs. Bödõ.

298
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,510
Mr. Halász. You almost
gave me a heart attack.

299
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,917
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Can I help you?

300
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,634
I wanted to say something
to Mr. Rose.

301
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,952
He stayed up late.
He must be still asleep.

302
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,515
But I'm happy to help you
if I can.

303
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,629
Listen, Mrs. Bödõ.
We've got to talk about this.

304
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,954
What about a morning snifter?

305
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,758
I don't expect that, Mr. Halász.
What do you think of me?

306
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,751
Only the best, from what lmre tells me.
That Mrs. Bödõ is like a

307
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,755
mother to him!

308
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,430
- Mr. Rose always exaggerates.
- To your health!

309
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,834
- To Mr. Rose.
- So that he could always sing to us.

310
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,119
May he do so.

311
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,318
I know that nobody knows lmre
as well as you do.

312
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:07,593
1 August 1904. Forty years,
three months and nineteen days.

313
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,518
That's a lot even in marriage.

314
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,713
Well, that I don't know. I couldn't
even stand a year with my old man.

315
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,629
I gave him his marching orders.

316
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,519
He drank, the wretch.

317
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,116
And that caused his death,
as I heard.

318
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,914
Here I was in Budapest,
all alone, the child in my arms.

319
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,309
Mr. Rose took me in.
Got a heart of gold.

320
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,828
Never met anyone like him.

321
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,197
Imre's very ill. You know
he's an artist, his soul

322
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,468
can't bear these atrocities.

323
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,675
I know, only I thought
I'd ask him if he fancied

324
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,790
a little pigeon soup.

325
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,233
I always made some
when he was poorly.

326
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,393
Mr. Skubala's brought
a brace of pigeons.

327
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,274
Make him some.
I'll take it up to him.

328
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,478
Is there still salt in the larder?

329
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,315
Salt?

330
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,916
Aren't those two whole
sacks enough?

331
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,629
- Tomi, watch out!
- Faster! Even faster!

332
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,716
- Faster, faster!
- Father!

333
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,239
- No faster?

334
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,114
Ah, hello.
How are you?

335
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,068
- Hello.
- Coming for a walk?

336
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,954
- Very kind.
- We've come to say goodbye.

337
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,875
If you'll excuse us...

338
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,510
Goodbye? What goodbye?
What are all those cases?

339
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,957
We're leaving, Mr. Fischbaum.
We're going to the ghetto.

340
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,954
- But why?
- What are you doing, Mr. Waltz?

341
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,315
Oh, Mr. Halász,
I've told her we can't do that.

342
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,399
We're going to town.
Please, don't be angry.

343
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,075
We don't want to be
any trouble to anyone.

344
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,513
We're going to the ghetto.

345
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,198
Now? When the Arrow Cross are
everywhere?

346
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,955
We've made up our minds,
Mr. Halász.

347
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,153
And I? Then what shall I tell lmre?
What shall I tell?

348
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,192
That I let you walk out?

349
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,711
Lmre's a gentleman.
He will understand.

350
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,395
And your daughter?
Have you thought of her?

351
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,792
They won't let her get away,
that's for sure!

352
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,868
Well...
We'll try to be careful.

353
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,033
To be careful?
Look at yourselves,

354
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,354
I beg you.

355
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,952
- Oh, Mummy! Daddy!
- My darling, we simply don't

356
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,991
want to be any trouble to anyone.

357
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,795
Go back to your room, Mr. Waltz.
That'll be the best.

358
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,158
Go on. Please.

359
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,798
- Mrs. Bödõ. Come here, please.
- What's happening here, dear?

360
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,637
Don't ask me.
I don't know.

361
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,829
Mr. Halász must have said
something.

362
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,838
Nothing to me.
Only to open the dumbwaiter.

363
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,718
Four, three, two, one.

364
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,236
Do tell Mr. Rose that
I'm very angry why

365
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,111
he never sang this to me.

366
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,035
Tell him it all went very well.

367
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,075
Please, Mr. Halász,
pass on our gratitude.

368
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,388
For a few minutes he made us
feel like human beings again.

369
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,555
That's not nice.
Look,

370
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,039
like this.

371
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,634
- Shall we put some flowers
in the window? - Yes.

372
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,434
A beautiful flower.
And look what's here.

373
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,155
- A tiny little...
- Pussy.

374
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,075
Much better, isn't it.
Now you draw something.

375
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,118
Come on poppet, it's late.
Let's give Auntie Olga a break.

376
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,918
Here's your tea, Father.

377
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,833
I didn't ask for any.

378
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,353
All right.
Come on, poppet.

379
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,192
Thomas Halász? In person?
Stand in front of me, please.

380
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,159
What's the first law
of the table? Tell me.

381
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,868
Whosoever disturbs through
unjustified tardiness

382
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,119
the family's lunch or dinner,
or does not obey

383
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,152
their mother's instructions
shall for one whole day

384
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,715
be the family's servant.

385
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,237
Until they make amends
for their sins.

386
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:13,632
Sarah, you see this?
You bore me a Moses!

387
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,999
Dead simple.
In on the bell, out when I knock.

388
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,469
Wonderful.

389
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,069
Have you seen Tomi?
We ought to go for water.

390
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,475
What is it?

391
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,269
- What's the matter, Olga?
- I'm scared.

392
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,988
I can't help feeling that we'll
only live as long as Mr. Rose sings.

393
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,837
Are you his lover?
Tell me!

394
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,671
- That's my business.
- No, you're wrong.

395
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,592
- I'm here, too.
- Why do you hurt me?

396
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,878
- Oh, please. Leave me alone.
- Are you his lover?

397
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,595
Yes, I am.

398
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,918
You brought me here
without telling me.

399
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,680
Think of mother.

400
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,037
What would she say about you
destroying a family's life.

401
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,189
You don't understand.

402
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,112
What is there to understand?

403
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,276
- We're only friends.
- A lover is not a friend.

404
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,313
You're lying.
How could you bring me here?

405
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,759
Where else could
we have gone?

406
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,190
But what about his family?
How could you do that?

407
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,949
- Are you seriously asking me?
- I am.

408
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,832
- His children, his wife?
- And...

409
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,114
what am I supposed to do?
Choose to be alone like you?

410
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,116
Excuse me.
May I come in?

411
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,355
Of course, you can.
Anyway, we're the ones

412
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,913
who're intruding.

413
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,273
Intruding? Come now. We're pleased
we can help, that's all.

414
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,831
But I hardly know Mr. Halász.

415
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,673
So what? It's quite enough
if Olga knows him well,

416
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,589
isn't it?

417
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,035
Exactly.

418
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,756
- Dad!
- Yes?

419
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,831
Will we really only live as long
as that?

420
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,796
- As long as what?
- Well, as long as Mr. Rose sings.

421
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,157
- Who told you that?
- Auntie Olga.

422
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,310
- Is Mr. Rose a Jew, too?
- Yes, he is.

423
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,918
Are Jews not Hungarians?

424
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,679
- It's not that simple.
- Why?

425
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,549
As our religions differ.
Ours is Jewish.

426
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,273
- And the Hungarians'?
- All sorts.

427
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,793
- Protestant...
- Then what makes them Hungarian?

428
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,035
We'll talk about
this in a few years' time...

429
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,278
It isn't easy to understand.

430
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,598
- The woman on the tram?
- What about her?

431
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,193
- She wasn't a Jew, was she?
- No, she wasn't.

432
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,828
- And nobody can meet him?
- Who?

433
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,038
Mr. Rose.

434
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,389
Nobody.

435
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,235
Not even me?

436
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,554
No.

437
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,275
Shame.

438
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,876
- I can't see.
- Read it!

439
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,110
By the rights invested upon me by
the Hungarian nation, I hereby order

440
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,512
every legal and natural entity to
yield assistance, without question

441
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,999
under any circumstance
to the valiant brother

442
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,631
Géza Horányi-Halász, Staff Captain,
Hero of the First Hungarian Army,

443
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,150
bearer of the Grand Silver Medal
of Honour, the Petit Cross

444
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:12,834
and the Officer's Spear
of the Order of Transylvania, and...

445
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,555
as possessor of these national
decorations,

446
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,512
the defender of the honour
and the repository

447
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,959
of the future of Hungary.

448
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,555
Ferenc Szálasi,

449
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,113
- Leader of the Nation.
- This'll give some chance of survival.

450
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,118
This rabble loves mysterious

451
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,912
documents like this.

452
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,196
They'll hang us all.

453
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,595
I'd add that the seal is original...
or almost original.

454
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,393
Not that I've ever actually
seen one.

455
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,112
You're out of your mind.

456
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,230
We'll crease it a little,
and stain

457
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,670
it here and there.
Even our great arsehole leader

458
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,473
- will not suspect a thing.
- You've got a screw loose.

459
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,118
- Ladies and Gentlemen! Allow me...
- They'll hang us, Géza.

460
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,718
- You said you had nowhere to sleep!
- Please, Gran!

461
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,115
- Where were you last night?
- Nowhere! Here, at home.

462
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,596
- Home! You're a tramp!
- That's not true.

463
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,959
I feel ashamed of you.
Are you going out again?

464
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,075
No.

465
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,352
You're lying again.

466
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,115
It's good that your mother
could not see that.

467
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,789
Why aren't the curtains drawn?
People can see in.

468
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,114
Oh, Gran.

469
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:53,870
The cricket's keeping me awake.
Have you listened to the radio today?

470
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,596
- Yes.
- And?

471
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:06,511
- Just the usual things. They're coming.
- Coming, but when?

472
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,589
What?!

473
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,638
Good morning.
Zdrast-vuy-tje.

474
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,630
- What are you up to now?
- Russian conversation, for travellers.

475
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,034
- I can see that.
- So?

476
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,276
But we're not going
anywhere, Géza.

477
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,309
If they find this,
they'll shoot the whole family.

478
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,275
Nonsense, darling.
Why would they find it?

479
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,909
Zdrast-vuy-tje.

480
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,873
And who knows
the eighth rule?

481
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,959
- Julo? Do you?
- What? I don't know. What is it?

482
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,469
Do you know what a
peeping Tom is?

483
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,077
No, I don't!

484
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,114
Don't you? Would you fetch
the dictionary, then?

485
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,759
Oh, it's so Jewish.

486
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,393
- It's so what?
- Jewish.

487
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,835
What do you mean Jewish, Julo?

488
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,873
Running around for dictionaries
and encyclopaedias.

489
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,997
Who says so?

490
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,038
Pászthy... t-h-y.

491
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,632
And who is Pászthy, t-h-y
if I may ask?

492
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,880
A girl in my class.

493
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:12,273
I see. Well, if you'll allow me,
I'll go and fetch it myself.

494
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,157
I once go to the Orpheum.
There were beautiful girls.

495
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,799
Very beautiful girls.
They dance...

496
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,554
and they no have knickers.
Lift their legs

497
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,592
and nothing underneath.

498
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,551
Mr. Halász. I just wanted to tell you
that I'm going to lock the upper gate.

499
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,708
- As you think best.
- I'm just telling you.

500
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,476
- We come this way when we go to
get water. - I'll lock it.

501
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,718
- All right.
- Would you tell Mr. Rose

502
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,036
to look for somebody else?
I won't be coming any more.

503
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,830
I'll tell him.

504
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,879
Here's something else.
Your daughter wrote this

505
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,748
to my son.
Read it.

506
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,718
<i>Hands up!</i>
<i>Higher!</i>

507
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,109
<i>What's this?</i>

508
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,875
<i>A nest of Jews?</i>

509
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,550
I don't speak German.

510
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,992
<i>She doesn't speak German</i>.

511
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,633
Of course, even if I spoke it,
I would never talk to a German.

512
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,716
- Vera!
<i>- What did she say?</i>

513
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:19,317
<i>She said why don't we offer</i>
<i>the gallant gentleman a drink</i>.

514
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:28,080
<i>Stalingrad's a long way away!</i>
<i>You'll work up a real thirst</i>

515
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,436
- <i>before you get there</i>. - <i>I can see</i>
<i>by your nose you're a Jew, too</i>.

516
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,236
<i>Nu, have you got a better offer?</i>

517
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,553
<i>I like you</i>.

518
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:46,073
<i>At the moment I can't reciprocate</i>
<i>your feelings, mister soldier</i>.

519
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,669
<i>Very good!</i>
<i>Very good!</i>

520
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,950
<i>Perhaps if we sit down for a little</i>.
<i>I'm sure a drink wouldn't go amiss</i>.

521
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,870
<i>These are difficult times, but we're</i>
<i>all still just people, aren't we?</i>

522
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,197
<i>It's not easy for you, but</i>
<i>neither is it for us</i>.

523
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,395
<i>That's true</i>.

524
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,033
<i>War is war</i>.
<i>It's not easy for anyone</i>.

525
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:34,478
<i>Budapest is a beautiful city</i>.
<i>Full of beautiful women</i>.

526
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,750
<i>Yes, indeed</i>.
<i>Beautiful women</i>.

527
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,271
<i>"In war a woman is</i>
<i>a real treasure. "</i>

528
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,990
<i>Who knows what tomorrow may</i>
<i>bring. Will we be alive at all?</i>

529
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,833
<i>Yes, indeed</i>.

530
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:04,872
<i>Will we be alive at all? Would you</i>
<i>tell us what we can do for you?</i>

531
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,676
<i>I get 10,000 pengõs</i>.

532
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,912
- <i>Pardon?</i>
- <i>10,000 pengõs</i>

533
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,713
<i>and you can stay</i>.

534
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,795
<i>And if we</i>
<i>don't have 10,000 pengõs?</i>

535
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,313
<i>Then I'll requisition this villa</i>
<i>in the name of General von Scheck</i>.

536
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,989
<i>I see</i>.

537
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,828
<i>Prosit!</i>

538
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,110
<i>To the beautiful Jewish women!</i>
<i>Sieg heil!</i>

539
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,988
<i>To women!</i>

540
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,750
<i>Mummy, I really need a pee</i>.

541
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,239
- <i>To the Reich!</i>
- <i>To the Reich!</i>

542
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,395
<i>To the Führer!</i>

543
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,234
<i>To the Führer!</i>

544
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,512
<i>I really need to go</i>...

545
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,638
<i>To life!</i>

546
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,076
- <i>To life!</i>
- <i>To life!</i>

547
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,191
<i>To Jewish death!</i>

548
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,472
<i>To Jewish death!</i>

549
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,793
What have you done? Is he dead?
You've killed a German soldier!

550
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,839
- I haven't killed him, he's gone to sleep.
- I knew there would be trouble.

551
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,511
Shall I pistle on the axel?

552
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,873
Do what on the what?

553
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,872
It won't squilch.

554
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,074
Squilch?
Where do you learn such words?

555
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,351
Mr. Skubala always pistles
on the axel when it squilches.

556
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,635
I see.

557
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,798
- Are you sure this works?
- Sure.

558
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,030
We have to wait
a little until it seeps in.

559
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,473
I see.

560
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,478
What did you do with him?

561
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,878
We've put him in a wagon.

562
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,112
- What if he comes back tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

563
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,471
He won't even know
which country he's in.

564
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,231
- Then the day after!
- Where from?

565
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,555
Szeged? Szabadka?
Or who knows where?

566
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,234
- Anywhere.
- He won't remember.

567
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,951
He'll think the whole thing

568
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,272
was just a bad dream.

569
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,038
Everybody's frightened.
Except, of course, Father.

570
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,753
Imre?
Did he appear?

571
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:24,599
No.
But the Waltzes have gone.

572
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,910
- Didn't even say goodbye.
- What?

573
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,119
They went without a word.

574
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,036
What a fool I am!

575
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,998
I beg your pardon, Mr. Waltz.
I do apologise.

576
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,235
I forgot about you.

577
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,713
I'm really sorry.

578
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,149
You don't need
to apologise, Mr. Halász.

579
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,511
- Do come out.
- Don't!

580
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,753
- How could you do such a thing?
- I'm sorry.

581
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,758
Shame on you! You swine!
Forgot about us!

582
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,789
What if I'd suffocated?
Eh? What if we'd suffocated?

583
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,555
The Lord moves
in mysterious ways.

584
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,275
Please.
A little decorum, dear.

585
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,636
Please calm down.
I'm very sorry. Very sorry.

586
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,911
How could you forget about us?

587
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,433
How could you do this?

588
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:30,437
I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

589
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,029
Mr. Halász understands.
The chronic lack of oxygen

590
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,799
- in the brain.
- Mummy, dear.

591
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,069
- I need a pee desperately.
- Come on.

592
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,515
- Wake up, poppet. Do you hear?
- I'm not at home, Mum.

593
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,478
You must wake up.
Quick. Please.

594
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,713
- It's still dark. In the morning.
- Come on, hurry! Get dressed!

595
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,518
Tomi, wake up! Do you hear?
Get dressed! Quick!

596
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,472
- What is it?
- Get dressed. Quick! Hurry!

597
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,795
Zsuzsõ!

598
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,993
What in God's holy name
is going on here, brothers?

599
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,919
Is that how you greet your fellows
in the new motherland?

600
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,395
- Fortitude! Hail Szálasi!
- Fortitude! Hail Szálasi!

601
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,435
Árpád!

602
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,957
Skubala! Did you bring
this drunken rabble here?

603
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,470
Not so fast...
We'll quieten you down soon.

604
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,478
You come here
disturbing decent citizens!

605
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,029
Why aren't you
in the ghetto, Jew?

606
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,954
Your papers!
What are you waiting for?

607
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,708
I'm sorry, Captain!
Fortitude!

608
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,635
I'm sorry.

609
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,870
Is this a Jew's arm? I sacrificed
this, for our beloved Transylvania!

610
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,349
Once again I apologise,
Captain.

611
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,871
You oaf! Didn't you tell the brothers
that Mr. Rose sang in person

612
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,071
- to the Führer on his birthday?
- Please forgive me, Sir.

613
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,111
The star on the gate misled us.

614
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,909
Scratch it off!
Fortitude!

615
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,748
Fortitude!

616
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,237
Is this a Jew's arm?

617
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,912
Skubala, you fucking bastard.

618
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,078
Did you hear?
Scratch it off!

619
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,312
Put this on your forehead.

620
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,996
They can't leave you in peace,
even at night.

621
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,950
The devil take them!

622
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,834
- What will become of us,
Mr. Halász? - Vera, please.

623
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,190
- They've gone. - First the
German, then these people...

624
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,789
Go back to bed.
They were just drunkards...

625
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,030
Please go, Mr. Halász.

626
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,639
Please go.

627
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,589
Imre!

628
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,515
Lili!

629
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,878
Don't do it, Géza.
You can't.

630
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,277
Let's go to the ghetto!

631
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,916
At least we'll be safe there!

632
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,476
I have to talk to lmre about it.

633
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,677
He's alone, but you must think
of your family - your children.

634
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,549
So, talk to him, please.

635
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,198
I'll sell the Bible tomorrow -
we need that 1,000 pengõs.

636
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,234
Will he let you?

637
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,948
He said I could. That's why
he gave it to me.

638
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:06,919
Dad? Was Árpád with them, too?
Tomi said...

639
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,274
Árpád was here.

640
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,515
Was he?

641
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,837
- Yes, he was.
- Are you sure, Dad?

642
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,949
Yes, I'm sure, sweetheart.

643
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,719
Hey, slow down! Wait!
Careful!

644
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,998
King St. Stephen's Bible - I can
hardly believe it.

645
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,712
Odrola, some tea for
the gentleman,

646
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,071
and give the boy some sweets.

647
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,112
I bet the old hag hasn't
even moved

648
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:23,510
deaf as a post.
Aren't you cold?

649
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,237
I'm frozen to the bone.
Is this yours?

650
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,718
No, I'm here on behalf of
lmre Rose.

651
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,472
Rose, the famous countertenor?

652
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,475
Yes.

653
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,672
Mr. Halász, you put me
in a difficult position.

654
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:51,033
This is not just a rare book.

655
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,719
It's like the Holy Crown of Hungary
or the coronation robe.

656
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:03,315
It's as if I were to sell you one of
the tablets of the Ten Commandments.

657
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,031
Mr. Kalmár, it'd be a great
help to us. Times are hard.

658
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,439
I never thought I'd live to hold
the first Hungarian king's bible.

659
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,913
I never dared to dream of this.

660
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,393
For an old man, like me,
this is the grace of God itself.

661
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,668
Mr. Kalmár, I have Mr. Rose's
permission to sell this very

662
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,836
rare book - if you want it.

663
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,434
Always money!

664
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,079
Nothing else matters, just money.

665
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:43,116
You're Jews if I'm not mistaken.
That's what's wrong with you -

666
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,997
you live here with us
but you don't understand a thing.

667
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,235
I didn't mean to offend you,
Mr. Kalmár.

668
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,398
I'm not offended.
Are you a lawyer?

669
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,634
No, I was an engineer
in the Ganz Factory

670
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,948
until I had to leave
because of my origin.

671
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,995
It's not easy for anyone today.

672
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,190
Then Mr. Rose offered me a job.
Now I work as a caretaker for him.

673
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,312
At least there's a roof
over our heads.

674
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,680
May I ask how long you
have known him?

675
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:28,275
Since I was a child.
My father had a little grocer's shop.

676
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:32,552
He paid for his first singing
lessons.

677
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,435
Believe a blind old man,
those happy years will

678
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,232
never return.

679
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,835
40 pengõs.
Can you change 50?

680
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,433
The congregation is poor.

681
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,676
All right, keep it.
I can see you're a gentleman.

682
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,438
Pay me back later.
You owe me 10 pengõs.

683
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,509
- The fly...!
- Pardon? What did you say?

684
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,275
Nothing.

685
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,351
Where are you going? Get in line,
pigs! Or do you want to die here?

686
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,995
Look, I've got papers.

687
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,796
To wipe my arse with?
Or what?

688
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,513
Please show them to
Sándor Csija.

689
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,835
- He's a childhood friend of mine.
- Anything else?

690
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,397
What are doing? That's an important
document. There'll be trouble.

691
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,073
You may get yourself
into deep water.

692
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,396
- Are you a Yid?
- Who? Me?

693
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,830
- I resent that!
- Your son?

694
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,711
Come here.

695
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,874
Swear on his life.

696
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,957
- Yes, I'm a Jew.
- You see? Fall in!

697
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,356
Chin up.
It'll be all right.

698
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,951
Stop jabbering. Huh!
Csija's buddy!

699
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,872
<i>Move along!</i>

700
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,518
<i>Hurry. Don't stop!</i>

701
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,350
<i>What's happening at the back?</i>
<i>Close up!</i>

702
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,634
Get ready.
Don't be afraid.

703
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,159
I dream my own death.

704
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,794
Where's my tea?

705
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:45,393
<i>A Jewish seed in my garden grew,</i>
<i>I watered it with vitriol</i>

706
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,590
<i>through and through</i>.

707
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,831
<i>Yet still he grew, arms,</i>
<i>legs and beard</i> - 

708
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,030
<i>And a stinking Jewish neck</i>
<i>for the rope he feared!</i>

709
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,795
<i>A Jewish seed in my garden grew,</i>
<i>I watered it with vitriol</i>

710
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,354
<i>through and through</i>.

711
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,913
<i>Yet still he grew, arms,</i>
<i>legs and beard</i> - 

712
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,356
<i>And a stinking Jewish neck</i>
<i>for the rope he feared!</i>

713
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:02,229
- Tomi!
- Dad!

714
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:32,313
Géza! We've caught
the peeping Tom at last!

715
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:05,630
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

716
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,239
Something terrible's happened.

717
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,430
- What is it?
- Isn't Julo here?

718
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,596
- No.
- Oh, that poor thing.

719
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,319
The Skubala boy, Árpád,
has hung himself.

720
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,236
He didn't even want to come...
I told him to.

721
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,953
He wrote this to Julo.
Would you give it to her?

722
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,474
I'll never forgive myself,
Mr. Halász.

723
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:46,554
I wasn't even there.
His mother cut him down.

724
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,195
I'd rather hang myself.

725
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,034
I'm truly sorry.
He was a good lad.

726
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:06,192
He was.
Would you tell Mr. Rose, please?

727
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,949
I will.

728
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,998
I'll open the upper gate.
If you agree.

729
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,875
Do it.
Mr. Rose will be glad.

730
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,236
I know it hurts terribly now.

731
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,354
- Honey.
- It doesn't.

732
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:58,678
- How can you say that?
- It doesn't hurt at all.

733
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,269
But I can see it does.

734
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,916
I don't want to be a Jew, Mum.

735
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,030
Don't be silly.

736
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,110
I don't want to be a Jew,
do you understand?

737
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:29,428
- I do. - I don't want to!
I don't want to be a Jew! I don't!

738
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,115
<i>Stop it</i>.

739
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:57,074
We are going to die, Tomi!
All of us.

740
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,712
Touch me, please.
Just once in a lifetime.

741
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,875
We are all going to die.
Touch me, please.

742
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,398
What are you doing?

743
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,908
I've had enough.
I'm going to the countryside.

744
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:35,392
I want to see cows and pigs!
A load of smelly pigs!

745
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,958
Would you tell Mr. Rose?
I knocked but

746
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,194
he didn't answer.

747
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,949
I can't stand this anymore.

748
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,631
You do everything for
him anyway.

749
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,190
Do think it through,
Mrs. Bödõ!

750
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,917
Think it through?
There's nothing to think through.

751
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,674
Mrs. Bödõ!
Stop and think!

752
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,673
Think?
Times have changed.

753
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,712
Take care of yourselves.
If the Russians come or the English,

754
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,435
go down to the cellar.
You may be safe down there.

755
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,231
- What about Magda?
- You've seen her?

756
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,759
- No.
- Me neither!

757
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,072
A fine sort she is!

758
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,876
First she says she's got nowhere to
sleep, then she disappears.

759
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,512
Don't know where to
- just shrugs

760
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,272
her shoulders if I ask.

761
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,398
In my day I'd have got
a good hiding.

762
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,551
Tell her I've gone home.
She'll find me.

763
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,278
- God bless you.
- Let me help.

764
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,629
Don't bother.
You have enough to worry about.

765
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,518
Thank you for everything.
We're going back to town.

766
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,875
- And Olga?
- She's coming, too. Getting ready.

767
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:22,918
- What's this all about?
- Nothing! We're going!

768
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,877
You're not going anywhere!

769
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,036
You tell your wife what to do,
not me!

770
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,958
What's a matter with you?
That's not what we agreed!

771
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,560
I can't stay any longer.
I've had enough.

772
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,989
- What's happened?
- What's happened?

773
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,157
Everything's over, my life, the
world. And you ask

774
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,919
- what's happened?
- I can't let you go!

775
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,349
- You must.
- Olga, please stay.

776
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:46,198
- We're going.
- What good will it do?

777
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:51,471
Think it over! It's not
easy for anyone! Stay.

778
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,199
I won't.

779
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,673
And if I ask you?

780
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:12,357
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right.

781
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,990
Calm down.
Everything's OK.

782
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,795
Can you see it?

783
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,110
You are here.
It's okay.

784
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,713
You can go and get
that mirror very soon.

785
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:34,599
Géza, how say in Russian
"stinking mess"?

786
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,559
I don't know.
It's not in the dictionary.

787
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,878
I know. Important
words never in dictionary.

788
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,480
Géza, tell Father
to stop this talk, please.

789
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,831
Zdrastvuystje tovarishi.
Here it is.

790
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,594
It's not correct...
Zdrastvuytje tovarishi.

791
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,115
That's correct...
Zdrastvuytje tovarishi.

792
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,271
Honestly, this is
driving me crazy.

793
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:11,670
- What you say?
- Zdrastvuytje tovarishi.

794
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,709
I beg you, Father. They're bombing
because we're under siege.

795
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,591
They want to oust the Germans.

796
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,948
- I know.
- Well, thank God.

797
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,034
I only don't know how to say
"stinking mess".

798
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,271
Zdrastvuytje tovarishi.

799
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,912
Zdrastvuytje tovarishi.

800
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:41,557
Nu. Don't know.
Then I say in German.

801
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:46,352
That'll be great, Father.
Then they'll certainly shoot us all.

802
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,714
Make your face sooty, Julo.
Do you hear?

803
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,749
I've done it.

804
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,792
- I don't believe you.
Come here. - Yes.

805
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,555
- I thought so!
- Shall I make my face dirty, too?

806
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,268
I'll do it for you, Tomi.
Come over here!

807
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,272
No, thank you.

808
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:12,557
Death be here.
I can smell it.

809
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:24,999
Russian no hurt me now.

810
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,715
The war's over.

811
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,839
Aunt Lili!
Mr. Halász!

812
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,358
<i>War is over!</i>

813
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,595
Mr. Halász!

814
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,548
<i>Aunt Lili!</i>

815
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,953
<i>War is over!</i>

816
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:31,518
Do you hear, Father?
We've won. Once again.

817
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,875
Don't do a thing, Géza. Let them
take whatever they want! Do you hear?

818
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,077
Here you are. Look here. See?
Read it all. It's written here.

819
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,556
And there's a stamp. Stamp!
You'll be shot in the head

820
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:13,313
for this. Do you want that?
What are you staring at?

821
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,829
Get out!

822
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,110
I'm Marshal Malinovsky's
interpreter. Clear out! Scram!

823
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,799
- <i>He's some top dog!</i>
- <i>Let's get out of here!</i>

824
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,715
Here is some schnapps.
This will be good for you.

825
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,590
Come away from
the window, Tomi!

826
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,828
Look at the thermometer
and get back into bed, will you?

827
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,072
- I can look at it here, too.
- <i>No, you can't</i>.

828
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,830
- Do you want to get even worse?
- It's not at all cold here.

829
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:05,429
You just can't feel it...
Come on, now! Dad will be angry.

830
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,076
Don't! Stop it! Don't!

831
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,478
- When will they get back?
- Patience.

832
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,956
- Can I go for the water tomorrow?
- If you're better.

833
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,674
Julo will be happy
if she doesn't have to go.

834
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:43,997
Tomi! Where are you going?!

835
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,956
Mr. Rose!
