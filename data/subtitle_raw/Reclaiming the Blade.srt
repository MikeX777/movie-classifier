00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:34,130
[music]

3
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,661
When men were to
take up arms,

4
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:08,666
the predominant object
was the sword.

5
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,998
'Cause when I have done
sword fights in movies,

6
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:16,804
I've always thought about:
What are they for?

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,746
Often these things were
right at the point of history.

8
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:29,015
They're such a part
of our cultural heritage.

9
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,693
[hammer striking]

10
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,531
[music]

11
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,607
The Medieval
and Renaissance blade,

12
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,774
a profound
and beautiful object

13
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,978
handcrafted by
master artisans of old.

14
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,817
It is designed to kill.

15
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,415
The truth of the sword
has been shrouded in antiquity

16
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,587
and the Renaissance martial arts
that brought it into being

17
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,528
are long forgotten.

18
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,260
The ancient practitioners
lent us all that they knew

19
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,768
through their manuscripts.

20
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,032
As gunslingers
of the Renaissance

21
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,837
they were the westem heroes
with swords.

22
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,844
They lived and died by them.

23
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,676
Yet today, their history
remains cloaked

24
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,683
under a shadow of legend.

25
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,912
Before the invention
of gunpowder,

26
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,388
the sword was
the weapon of the time.

27
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,959
The sword probably has not
been a relevant weapon

28
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,755
for at least 200 years.

29
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:48,425
To think that a pummel,
a handgrip, a crossbar, a blade,

30
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:52,631
a very simple object
could hold such sway

31
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,197
over thousands of years
of human evolution.

32
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,369
These objects have really
controlled our history

33
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,379
and where we are today.

34
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,014
Swords have been used
throughout history

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,021
to defend people and land,
to build nations

36
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,217
and to protect kingdoms
from tyranny.

37
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,226
From 1st century wars
against Rome

38
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,455
to the Viking
and Norman conquests,

39
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,362
sword and steel have
changed the fate of kingdoms,

40
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:25,403
the map of Europe and ultimately
the timeline of world history.

41
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,303
Their essential role
in preserving freedom and honor

42
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,969
goes back far into
the dim mists of history.

43
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,410
The connection between
sword and freedom

44
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,846
may perhaps find its
origin within the customs

45
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,010
of the Germanic
and Celtic tribes.

46
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:43,680
Here, being armed with a sword
was not only a right

47
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,089
but also a duty
of all free men.

48
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,627
In fact, the ceremony
for giving freedom to a slave

49
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,663
required that
the former slave

50
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:56,667
be presented with
the armament of a free man.

51
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:02,499
Many British kings chose to
trust their subjects with arms

52
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,407
and to supplement the militia
in times of need

53
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,105
rather than abolish it.

54
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:12,275
The idea of a free militia
versus a financed army

55
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,580
presents an interesting concept

56
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,747
that is reflected
in many of our modem films.

57
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,917
The sword is as relevant today
as a symbol

58
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,292
as it was in ages past,
being found within statues,

59
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,993
civic emblems, and insignia
both ancient and modern.

60
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,037
It has been an ancient symbol
for words spoken in truth,

61
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:36,734
for purity, justice
and the spirit of God.

62
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,711
The iconic power of the sword
is everywhere within our culture

63
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,475
from literature to
popular entertainment and

64
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:48,885
nowhere is it more celebrated
than in the modern cinema.

65
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,323
There's a definite symbolism
that's part and parcel

66
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,260
of every story
containing a sword.

67
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,856
The sword combines
power, authority,

68
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,495
and the threat of impending
violence all in a prop,

69
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,436
which might be hanging
off somebody's side

70
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,804
until the moment
they draw it.

71
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,436
I think there's something
more intimate about

72
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,446
two guys going at it
with swords.

73
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:20,178
To fight someone with a sword
as opposed to shooting someone

74
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,187
with a gun, I think
it takes more courage.

75
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,157
It's conflict at its most raw
where you've got two characters

76
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,024
Iooking at each other eye to eye
engaging at that level.

77
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,324
And the stakes are higher
it could go either way.

78
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,400
You are right there in the end
and the sword, in many ways,

79
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,092
is an extension
of that character's arm

80
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,103
so it's really
a sharpened fist.

81
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,140
It suddenly is a realm
of myth, of legend,

82
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,540
of heroes, of adventures.

83
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,274
That would explain to a large
degree the popularity of swords.

84
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,283
They're, you know,
an integral part of it.

85
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:57,155
Our technology has progressed
far beyond needing the sword

86
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,419
as an object of personal
defense, and while

87
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,051
it's still irrelevant, don't
you think it's interesting

88
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,959
the extent to which
we seem to still have

89
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:08,397
the image of the sword,
the concept of the sword,

90
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,662
the symbolic importance
of the sword.

91
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,238
I mean, it's hard to
turn on the television

92
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,273
or go to the cinema,
it seems,

93
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,640
without still being
surrounded by swords.

94
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:41,056
[music]

95
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,751
Our stories and movies contain
the kind of morality and justice

96
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,725
that we only wish we could
find in the real world.

97
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:42,094
I've had the honor really--
I have to say it like that--

98
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,291
I've had the honor really--
I have to say it like that--

99
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,663
of working with Bob Anderson
as my swordmaster.

100
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,568
In all of the fights that
I did on film as a coach,

101
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,197
and indeed as a modern fencer,

102
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,335
has undoubtedly been
my life, swordplay.

103
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,242
Others who have worked
with him feel like I do,

104
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,872
that you always want to give
100% to live up to

105
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,349
the choreography
that he comes up with.

106
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,420
Even his presence,
just him walking on the set,

107
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,887
suddenly you have to pick
up your game a bit, you know.

108
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,254
The first time I met
Bob Anderson was actually

109
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,224
on the set of
"Lord of the Rings."

110
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,353
He turns around and
introduces himself and says,

111
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,021
"Well, I'm going to show you
a few things that might

112
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,962
save your life today, mate."

113
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:25,197
And so he proceeded to show
me some basic blocking

114
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,569
and thrusting and
cutting moves with the sword.

115
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,405
And the guy who came after him
to show me some more says,

116
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,070
"Oh, do you realize
who that was?"

117
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,670
And I was like,
"No, I don't."

118
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,908
"Well, that's
Bob Anderson.

119
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,247
"He, you know, he used
to train Errol Flynn

120
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,253
and you know, has worked for
years in the industry."

121
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,255
And I said, "Oh really,
is that so?"

122
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,415
Why don't you give up?

123
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,425
You can see
I'm a better swordsman

124
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,963
Errol Flynn was a very
talented, athletic actor

125
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,328
who could do anything
if he set his mind to it.

126
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,596
And that's why he became
a swordsman, I think,

127
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,002
is because the parts that
were getting the publicity

128
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,042
in those days--
sword fighting and stuff--

129
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,077
fighting at the end,
and you know,

130
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,204
Douglas Fairbanks stuff
as it was called in those days.

131
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,681
Then he said,
"Oh, and he was Darth Vader."

132
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,344
He was actually in
Darth Vader's costume

133
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,353
actually doing all
the light saber work.

134
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,353
And I was like...

135
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,687
that sort of struck
a resonance with me, you know.

136
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,920
Oh, Darth Vader, yes.

137
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,932
It's just a cloak and a helmet
that I was underneath it all.

138
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,559
I did choreograph the fights.

139
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,331
I did three of those.

140
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,599
It was good work for me.

141
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:40,168
It became the weapon of choice
in that series of films.

142
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,543
Indeed even, it seems
when somebody's making

143
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,481
a science-fiction movie
and off in space

144
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,554
they can't seem to escape
from the sword.

145
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,679
I wonder why that is?

146
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,417
What is it?

147
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,187
It's your father's
light saber.

148
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,660
This is a weapon
of a Jedi knight.

149
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,392
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

150
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,370
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

151
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:12,740
To go into the future and
then think about laser swords,

152
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,506
that's brilliant.

153
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,583
Suddenly "Star Wars"
is not just a sci-fi movie,

154
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:22,279
it's also a modern version
of a hero legend.

155
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:28,020
"The Princess Bride"
was one of the best fights

156
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,255
and everybody tells me
it was one of the best fights

157
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,729
I've choreographed.

158
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,129
You seem like
a decent fellow.

159
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,700
I hate to kill you.

160
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,063
You seem like
a decent fellow.

161
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,431
I hate to die.

162
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,597
They learned to fight
with left and right hands.

163
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,731
Then why are you smiling?

164
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,605
Because I know something
you don't know.

165
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,768
And what is that?

166
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,641
I am not left-handed.

167
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,272
And then they do it again
when the other guy changes

168
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,351
to his right hand.

169
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,942
I'm not left-handed either.

170
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,448
Johnny is about as good
as you can get.

171
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,928
He can transform what
he leams from someone like me

172
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,090
into a character.

173
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,360
You know what you are doing,
I'll give you that.

174
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:14,565
Excellent form,
but how's your footwork?

175
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,169
Viggo came running in
from Los Angeles

176
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,805
and I stuck a sword in
his hand and he had to fight

177
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:27,943
20 stuntmen in almost
the same day as he arrived.

178
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,749
When all the stunties
with their swords at

179
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,652
the other end of the room
and Viggo was standing there

180
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,248
Iike looking around
like: What next?

181
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,191
And then all of a sudden
they just charged Viggo

182
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,263
and they're like running towards
him and he's just like...

183
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,956
had his sword up.

184
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,660
Apparently,
that was his initiation.

185
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:45,134
He didn't run away,
so I think Bob was like:

186
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,569
Okay, I think I can
work with this guy.

187
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,004
He had a lot to learn.

188
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,600
He did, I thought he
did extremely well.

189
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,072
You know, it was hard work
to prepare the fights

190
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,947
and demanding
physically at times.

191
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,919
But it was mostly fun
and it was sort of like

192
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:07,186
a boyhood dream come true.

193
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,625
You know, I got to
really do it for real.

194
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,492
There were real enemies,
it was a real sword.

195
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,464
It's important that the people
you're working with trust you

196
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,730
and you trust them and you
effectively work out the sort of

197
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:22,035
highly-detailed choreography
weeks and weeks in advance

198
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,405
of when you actually get
to do it on the set.

199
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,741
And then really the tough
thing becomes about stamina.

200
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,408
Especially when you are
wearing armor and leather

201
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,508
and weighed down
by all that sort of stuff.

202
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,678
I thought it was some of
the best choreography

203
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:40,816
I had seen in
this type of movie.

204
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:48,565
A lot of the stuff the stunt
men put together themselves.

205
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,830
And they did
a very good job of it.

206
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,599
He is much more than
a swordmaster, and I think

207
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,404
that directors have been well
pleased with his collaboration.

208
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,639
A sort of a regal refined
cultured kind of a gentlemen

209
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,908
in the midst
of all this chaos.

210
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,610
It was an honor to work
for him and I learned a lot.

211
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:11,554
Not just about sword fighting
but just about being a man,

212
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,023
about being a gentleman,
about how to deal with people

213
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,929
and a respect for the weapon.

214
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,361
and a respect for the weapon.

215
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,456
The swords were very well
done, very attractive.

216
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,229
John Howe's
designs were superb.

217
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,133
I really enjoyed getting
involved with

218
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,035
"The Lord of the Rings" swords

219
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,768
because it was always
a question of paring it down

220
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,640
and making the blades slimmer
and making it shorter,

221
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,805
making it more real,

222
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,816
even though we are not
talking about real swords.

223
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,149
The actor may tum up a year,
a year and half

224
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,314
after you first started
designing that weapon.

225
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,915
It's therefore a great thing
when you finally present

226
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,995
the weapon to the actor.

227
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,326
I really enjoyed working
with Richard Taylor

228
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:57,425
and all the people at
the Weta Workshop because they,

229
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,495
Iike Bob Anderson,
were sticklers for detail.

230
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:06,840
The attention to detail that
these guys devoted to items

231
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,382
that may not necessarily
be visible to the camera,

232
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,508
at least not on first viewing,
but they're there.

233
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:18,215
As an actor it was wonderful
to have those kind of props to

234
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,727
you know, really help transport
you to that time and place.

235
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,730
I liken our effects workshop as
are all other effects workshops

236
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,666
around the world, to be similar
to an artisan's studio

237
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,600
of the years past.

238
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,970
This is a gathering
of an eclectic group

239
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,408
of craftspeople working
across an amazing array

240
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:43,140
of different artistic skills
coming together.

241
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:48,482
It's a really exciting
thing to be part of that.

242
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,680
As a designer you can
draw your heart out.

243
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,656
You can draw hundreds, hundreds
of designs that you love

244
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,626
but if the man making them
doesn't understand then there's,

245
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,163
you know, it's--
everyone's disappointed.

246
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,927
We're incredibly fortunate to
have a fellow named Peter Lyon,

247
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,696
who was the metal worker,
the swordsmith on the movie.

248
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,534
And he's someone who understands
what weapons and armor are

249
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,371
and he did these
amazing blades.

250
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,629
The forging techniques I use
are some ways they're similar

251
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,292
and some ways they're different
from the old techniques.

252
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:40,361
With sword blades I'll start
with a bar of spring steel.

253
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,636
Usually, I'll cut and grind that
and then if necessary, forge it.

254
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,611
We use bronze, wood, leather,
and various other materials

255
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,477
that were used in period.

256
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,516
The main difference really,
is that today

257
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:56,850
with mass production
and steel foundries and so on,

258
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,552
that we can get things to
a much more consistent standard.

259
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,029
And essentially they're a lot
easier to get and work with.

260
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,567
The style of the sword,
the level of decoration,

261
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,431
the aging on it, they all
tell you a bit about

262
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,869
whether this character
is a new person,

263
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,440
whether they're
an old warrior.

264
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,338
It's a really
lovely experience

265
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,937
when the actors begin
to take ownership of them.

266
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,744
Bob very much encouraged you
to be familiar with this weapon,

267
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,945
which in some cases
is your livelihood.

268
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,751
Yes, it's only a movie, but,
the more you can feel like

269
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:37,352
it's not a movie,
the better the movie.

270
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,461
Actors on the stage
also demonstrate swordplay

271
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,904
through real-time
fight choreography.

272
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,251
[blades clashing]

273
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,352
[blades clashing]

274
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,831
[grunting]

275
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,334
Doing it on the stage
is so very difficult.

276
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,466
They have to
remember every blow.

277
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,374
On the films you can take
a part of the fight,

278
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,711
film it, do it once, twice,
15 times if necessary.

279
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,717
You get one chance on stage.

280
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,118
But you've got to be really good
to be a good stage swordfighter.

281
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,488
When you've gone to the cut,
and it comes in with a thrust,

282
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:45,791
you tum, and your hand is
stopped here and as you do it,

283
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:50,631
you transfer that
all in one fast move.

284
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,964
You try to hit him
on the head

285
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,301
with the cross part
of your sword.

286
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,739
Now if he hangs on to his
sword you pull him down

287
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,573
and you hit him under
the chin with the pommel.

288
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,775
But he knows that,
what he does is he lets go.

289
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,818
Then I go to hit him,
he has the advantage now

290
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,514
and that's why
you see them in the manuals.

291
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,090
The thing that we call
a glissar, which means to glide,

292
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:16,923
is which leads you
straight at his belly.

293
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,726
In the 18th century the move
still comes into swordplay.

294
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,700
We attack each other's chest,
he comes back,

295
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:29,365
I stretch him on the lunge, and
the glissar could disarm him.

296
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,841
So there is the same movement
over a period of 200 years

297
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,278
with different weapons
it still has the same intention.

298
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,110
All those moves,
you're trying to find out

299
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,844
what the other one's doing.

300
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:45,720
Now you can do the glissar
and then they all join together.

301
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,054
It's eye contact,
it's distance, it's balance,

302
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,791
it's timing
and it's intent.

303
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,890
I was looking at Andy's eyes,
I can see everything

304
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:59,459
that his body's doing but l
can also see Dad standing there

305
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,062
and I can see 180 degrees
in front of me.

306
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,665
Again the arm goes first,
the reality obviously

307
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,643
the arm plunge down
or through the throat.

308
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,738
See, there won't be a second
performance so we keep the arm,

309
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,317
shoulder, the body looking
as though it's going towards

310
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,444
the throat but at the last
moment we tum the point.

311
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,252
And to make it real,
he then defends and tums away.

312
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,519
'Cause I don't trust him.

313
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,095
I feel that I might get hit
so I then use the dagger

314
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,630
to make sure that the sword
has actually missed me.

315
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,633
You cut, and you hit him,
and you take his intestines out.

316
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,633
You hope.

317
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,931
The reason I don't hit him
is because as I cut him,

318
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,201
my elbow is pulling
the sword back into me.

319
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,640
The skill that that
needs is just as great

320
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,110
as the skill of killing
him is, of course,

321
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,807
sometimes the difference
of about 2 inches.

322
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,811
[swords clashing]

323
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:06,132
The point of choreography
in a play or a movie

324
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,399
is to forward the story.

325
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,499
If it does that
it is successful.

326
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,738
It's not designed to
actually show a real fight,

327
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,280
it's designed to show
something exciting with swords.

328
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,943
There's an undeniable
romanticism attached to it all.

329
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,386
And there's even
the grittier films, I think,

330
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,287
tend to steer clear
of much of the mechanics

331
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,519
of what a sword does
to a human body.

332
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,095
And it has to look
good on the screen.

333
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,460
I think, you know, I honestly
believe that a real fight

334
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,965
would be very short, sharp.

335
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,401
It's not just
a piece of art,

336
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,063
though it can be
appreciated that way.

337
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,573
It's not just
a piece of history

338
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,700
because they were used
for a purpose.

339
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:51,443
It is an ancient weapon that was
used to gain or lose kingdoms.

340
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,613
There's always been fighting.

341
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,916
There's never been a time

342
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,218
when there hasn't been
personal combat.

343
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:04,056
People are interested in combat
and cared about combat

344
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,687
from the highest
to the lowest in the land;

345
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,062
kings, and princes, emperors.

346
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,601
A sword as a weapon
is something that pretty much

347
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,536
everyone would have owned
it in the Anglian Period,

348
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,575
anyone being an adult male.

349
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,735
So, from top to bottom
of society

350
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,075
personal combat
was important.

351
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,679
Few subjects have received
such unfortunate neglect by

352
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,584
historians than the
martial arts of western Europe

353
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,156
although ancient kings
and nobles gave the blade

354
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,191
great credence
during their time,

355
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,818
often modern academics
fail to clearly write about

356
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,055
the reality of the blade,
defining its practice

357
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,725
as something apart from
its actual use.

358
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,667
It's quite a popular subject,
the history of dueling.

359
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,602
And you look at these books

360
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,573
and one thing they
never mentioned is the fighting.

361
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:54,942
You know, you'd think that this
was the raison d'etre of a duel.

362
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,537
But the one thing
they never mentioned

363
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,411
was techniques of combat.

364
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,417
It's a subject that
has been ignored

365
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,453
for the most part
for centuries.

366
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,352
Probably the world's foremost
scholar on historical fencing,

367
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,857
Dr. Sidney Anglo,
broke open the subject.

368
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,360
He said, "Hey historians,
you've missed the boat."

369
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,488
I'm sure that
a lot of historians

370
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,863
still find it kind of
not a proper subject.

371
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,595
That it isn't something
that historians

372
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,035
should be writing about.

373
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,799
Which, of course is foolish.

374
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,807
Think it's perhaps
not a very nice thing,

375
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,275
you know, these people
cutting each other to pieces

376
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,608
and running each other
through and so forth,

377
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,511
and often killing
each other, and

378
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:34,915
if they didn't kill each other
they often maimed each other.

379
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,454
Originally fencing meant
simply the art of defense;

380
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,353
the noble science of defense.

381
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,983
We have lots of records of
there being fencing schools

382
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,790
all over the place and we also
have records of people

383
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,955
complaining about
fencing schools and

384
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,557
the noise and the violence
that they engendered.

385
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:56,733
This changed bit by bit into the
late 16th and 17th century when

386
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:01,074
they became more fashionable for
nobles to go to these schools

387
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,148
and to learn how to fence.

388
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:04,916
Yet today, there are too few
historians that fully understand

389
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,908
Yet today, there are too few
historians that fully understand

390
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,477
the significant role
of medieval masters.

391
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,688
And so to a large extent much
of their history is lost to us.

392
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,856
The sobering death toll of the
First World War spoke plainly

393
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:26,905
the truth that the romance of
war was officially lost in time.

394
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:31,408
The one-on-one dueling spirit
of the sword could not prevail

395
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,877
under the shadow of automatic
machine gunfire with its

396
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,043
gruesome wake of millions who
were all too soon forgotten.

397
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,881
With the increased use
of firearms

398
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,579
during the tum of
the century

399
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,588
the slow erasure of
classical sword fighting

400
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,625
from public consciousness
seemed almost inevitable.

401
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,629
Fortunately the romance of
swordplay remained in the hearts

402
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,359
of early filmmakers
who kept it alive

403
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,459
through imagination
and fantasy.

404
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,530
But would the lost art of sword
defense every truly be reborn?

405
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,772
It was a change from battlefield
techniques and fighting skills

406
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,575
for judicial combat
and for private duel

407
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,980
and for street level
self-defense to essentially

408
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,645
gentlemen having private affairs
of honor, identical swords;

409
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,689
single sword against
single sword.

410
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:18,990
Most duels back in the day
were not to the death;

411
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,584
Most duels back in the day
were not to the death;

412
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,786
they were just to first blood.

413
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:29,856
During the 1700s you had guns
beginning to supplant

414
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:34,405
the sword as the choice
weapon for dueling

415
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:39,944
and in the mid-1800s fencing
became more and more a sport.

416
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,240
People started, you know,
playing the game

417
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,145
instead of training
to actually duel.

418
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,310
The term fencing today is
primarily synonymous with

419
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,323
the collegiate and Olympic sport
of epee, foil, and saber.

420
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,916
Now it's based on
hooking yourself up

421
00:24:56,027 --> 00:25:00,464
into an electric circuit
and depressing tips.

422
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,764
You can just slip it in
anywhere, as long as you

423
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,771
slip it in on target,
then it's a good touch for you.

424
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,570
Fencing became
more and more a sport

425
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,736
and there's a lot of aspects
of fencing that are fun.

426
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,145
Anybody who wants to leam how
to use a sword should go into

427
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:23,278
fencing because it teaches you
the handling of the weapon.

428
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,482
I like the honor aspect
and the dueling history

429
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,149
that goes along with it.

430
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,955
Modern fencing has retained
a lot of the values

431
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,029
of Renaissance fencing
in the way we always salute

432
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,963
before and after our bouts.

433
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,899
The thing that I like about
fencing is that it allows me

434
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,369
to do a physical
but also a mental sport.

435
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:43,066
It's much more a thinking game
than it is a physical game

436
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,974
despite the fact that it's a
tremendously athletic endeavor.

437
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:51,640
Tips of fencing blades
go as fast as 135 miles an hour.

438
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,550
Fencers have very quick
reflexes, a lot of leg strength.

439
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,987
You have to deal with someone
attacking you before you can go.

440
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,650
And fencing is straight
forward and back.

441
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,728
They're used to people
reacting to their moves

442
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,125
in a particular sort of ways.

443
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,258
There's a whole language of
this very highly refined sport.

444
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,598
It's not real, though.

445
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:17,767
And it's been 200 or 300 years
of evolution away from

446
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,902
people nicking one another
or cutting one another

447
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,037
or killing one another
with swords.

448
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,777
There are very specific
penalties for brutality and

449
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:30,184
hitting a little bit too hard
and if the referee in control

450
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,688
of the bout, if they thought it
was with malicious intent

451
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,056
or too hard or anything like
that you can get penalized,

452
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,026
docked points,
thrown out of the toumament.

453
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:44,796
You will see coupEs, flicks,
where the electric connection

454
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:49,533
on the end will score but if
you had a point you're making

455
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:55,841
a little bitty nick where as the
classical fencer will stick you.

456
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,415
I can get my rapier
and leverage him there

457
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,780
and come in here
and put it into him.

458
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:04,878
I was sparring with some friends
who were fencers and as

459
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,858
he lunged I slapped the blade
aside with my left hand

460
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,020
and extended my right
and stabbed him.

461
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,620
And he said,
"You can't do that."

462
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,700
And I said,
"But I just did."

463
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,893
I can engage it and
take it out this way.

464
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,437
Then he said,
"But that's illegal."

465
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,564
And I said, "I'm not
interested in legalities,

466
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,165
I'm trying to kill you."

467
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,005
They have no problem
grabbing you by the waist

468
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,204
and knocking you
to the ground

469
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,837
and beating you over
the head with their sword.

470
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:35,045
He does a lunge at me, I would
kick that leg out from him

471
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,882
and I'm gonna
half sword my rapier.

472
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,684
This wouldn't occur
to a fencer.

473
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,725
Fencing masters,
my fencing coaches would say,

474
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,225
"Well yeah,
you can't do that;

475
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,886
"You can't grab his leg,
you can't kick him,

476
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,327
you can't trip him,
you can't push him."

477
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,865
People weren't dumb
in the 1100s.

478
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,764
They had their own styles
or whatever

479
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,496
but they were
much more all encompassing

480
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,368
in terms of combat than
this kind of fencing is.

481
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,532
We don't think of
this as fighting.

482
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,839
There's a lot of aspects
of fencing that are fun,

483
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,346
but you can't take their rules
and things too seriously

484
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,111
because they just don't work
in a straight fight.

485
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,822
The evolution of fencing
is rather simple.

486
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,857
Historical swordplay
transitioned to

487
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,018
classical fencing upon
the advent of the gun.

488
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:20,996
Over the past century,
sport, or Olympic fencing

489
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:24,660
was developed from
classical fencing.

490
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,261
Modern sport fencing is not
necessarily an advancement of

491
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,241
historical European martial arts
but rather a pruning down

492
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,972
from older more inclusive
fighting systems.

493
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,778
In time, proper decorum
and stylized posture

494
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,217
came to replace
combat utility.

495
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,848
By the 19th century, fighting
men no longer needed to learn

496
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:50,485
and use diverse arms and armor
and had fewer occasions

497
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,155
to employ such skills.

498
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,324
Not surprisingly, what was
not modified and adapted

499
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:01,167
from the wider craft
consequently withered and died.

500
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,069
As they pursued
a far more specialized form

501
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:06,837
of gentlemanly fencing,
directed towards duels of honor

502
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,381
with single identical swords,
they came to dismiss

503
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,384
and sometimes even ridicule
older fencing skills.

504
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,183
At the same time, fencing
became more sport-focused

505
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,281
and in the 19th century it
increasingly lost its military

506
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,690
or self-defense value.

507
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,660
Those who continued to duel

508
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,996
did so under less and less
lethal terms.

509
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,401
The popular myth of crude
and clumsy medieval swords

510
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,567
slowly evolving into more
superior thrusting swords

511
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,543
began to surface
at this time.

512
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,375
Ancient European
martial arts

513
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,645
were now officially
lost in time.

514
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:58,863
[singing]

515
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,201
If you look at our society
there are a large number

516
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,261
of subcultures from reenactment,
from Revolutionary War

517
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,137
to even reenactment
of World War ll.

518
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,904
It's interesting in that
it puts the human being

519
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:17,880
back in to where he should be;
into the middle of it.

520
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,280
It's an interesting way
to study history

521
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:24,515
and it's a lot more fun than
sitting there with a book.

522
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,953
This is an epee blade.

523
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,525
This is what we originally
started using for fencing

524
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,718
in the SCA.

525
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,991
It's the same type of blade
that's used in strip fencing

526
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,190
that you would see
at the colleges.

527
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,201
The strip fencing
is more of a sport.

528
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,328
It's not really dedicated to

529
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,099
the medieval martial arts
of the sword.

530
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:46,007
What I have here looks
more like a real sword.

531
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,510
It's heavier but it is
still designed to be safe,

532
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,012
to bend without breaking.

533
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,982
It has more of the weight of
a real medieval sword, so we can

534
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,417
start to use the techniques
as they would have been used

535
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,251
in the Middle Ages with
a proper weighted weapon.

536
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,018
Well, it's
a wide spectrum of things;

537
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,387
it goes from people
dressed as Orchs

538
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:07,829
to very serious people
who weave their own cloth.

539
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,560
There is an individual
fulfillment that

540
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:15,071
the individual becomes somebody
more than just a small cog

541
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,403
in a large plastic machine.

542
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,170
Historical reenactment folks
have got their own culture

543
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,768
and it's an amazing thing.

544
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,374
It's a great to be in but
it's a whole gestalt for them.

545
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,044
It's a whole lifestyle
for them.

546
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:35,649
What we do is to create
a persona, each of us who joins.

547
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,819
My name is Greg Prevost
in the real world.

548
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,295
In the SCA, I'm known as
Janos of Kitmendown,

549
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,798
which is Welsh
and it's hard to spell.

550
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:47,395
You create the clothing,
the equipment for that person

551
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,803
and you become that
person at the events.

552
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,240
I take the name
Achbar lvanalli.

553
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,608
That name actually derives
from Andalusian Spain

554
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,340
so it's Moorish.

555
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,747
And my title in the SCA
is King currently.

556
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,581
But I'm also a knight
in the SCA.

557
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,348
Once you get knighted
you are knighted for life

558
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,923
so it's like a lifetime
achievement award.

559
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,085
This is a very
family-oriented society.

560
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,684
Everyone's welcome.

561
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,128
I have four children and
all of them have been to

562
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:16,666
their first event when they
were weeks or months old.

563
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,702
My oldest son is 11 now

564
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,600
and I'm starting to
teach him how to fence.

565
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:23,833
We don't chop each
other in this sport.

566
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:29,346
There's a thrust and
there's a draw cut.

567
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:35,215
Every kingdom is ruled
by a king and queen.

568
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,220
They are chosen by combat.

569
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,381
When all the fighters come
forward and they have

570
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:42,482
a best two-out-of-three
elimination tournament.

571
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:46,757
You call the wound as accurately
as you can what it would have

572
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,129
done to you if it had
been a real sword.

573
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,829
For instance, ifyou get hit
a legal blow to your leg,

574
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:57,339
you then have to drop your knees
and fight from the ground

575
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,434
which compromises your
mobility quite a bit.

576
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,641
Your opponent has the option of
being chivalrous and also taking

577
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:09,152
the same handicap so that
the match continues to be equal

578
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,618
but he doesn't have to.

579
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:11,586
It's on his honor.

580
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,249
If he does agree,
takes up that handicap,

581
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,851
then he is lauded by the
audience for his chivalry.

582
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,487
If I get hit with a solid blow
that would have been killing

583
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,226
with a real sword,
I will act out that death.

584
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,165
We don't say that
we are dead,

585
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,294
we say we are
disinclined to continue.

586
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:28,895
People see us fight
from a distance

587
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,770
at first they think of
Medieval Times,

588
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,435
strictly for the entertainment
of people watching.

589
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,636
The SCA's completely different.

590
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,906
It's an actual sport.

591
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:36,912
We're competing.

592
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,142
Every blow thrown out there
is thrown with real force.

593
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,514
We don't know who, when we
step on the field, will win

594
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,109
and we don't know
who will be the next king

595
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,712
until the last blow
is thrown in the tournament.

596
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:49,589
It's just a different spin off
of the same basic history.

597
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,857
The creative part is we take the
best parts of the Middle Ages

598
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,730
and we try to recreate them;
the beauty, the pageantry.

599
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,564
We leave behind
the plague and the death.

600
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,332
I think that reenactment
is an interesting and valid,

601
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,876
I feel like, approach to--
approach to history,

602
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:10,641
it can be a very rich, rich,
rich source of information.

603
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,613
It's also a little
bit dangerous,

604
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,311
because reenactment is
now becoming a part of

605
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,287
history itself which
troubles me quite a bit.

606
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:23,383
When you take a pipe and you
wrap it with some padding and

607
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,827
you whack on one another that's
no different from reality than

608
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,128
we who fence with electronic
gear that lets us know

609
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,429
whether or not a touch
would have happened.

610
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,300
If the swords were
actually sharp,

611
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,339
most of these guys really
wouldn't be doing this.

612
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,602
And I wouldn't be either.

613
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:49,544
There are many martial arts
within the Asian culture.

614
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,521
Out of China you have
manta style, tiger style,

615
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,784
eagle style, wing tsun.

616
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:59,090
From Korea, you have taekwondo,
kongsoodo, soobahkdo,

617
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:04,430
kwonbup, taekyun, hapkido,
yudo, gumdo, gumsool.

618
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:09,063
Out of Japan you have the very
familiar karate, judo, kendo.

619
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:13,041
Out of the Philippines
you have escrima or amis.

620
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,544
Out of Thailand
you have muy thai.

621
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,910
Out of Burma
you have bando

622
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,176
and I'm sure there are
many, many others.

623
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,775
When you hit a target area,
you have to say

624
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:28,018
where you're hitting;
so, "head," "wrist," "side."

625
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,287
Hua-mo-ah!

626
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:35,388
Just coming in and hitting
is not considered a point.

627
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,491
I have to have
proper etiquette.

628
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,436
I have to make
a pronounced step.

629
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,566
I have to hit the proper part
of my sword which is in between

630
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:48,474
this leather piece
and this leather piece.

631
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,876
Ah-oo!

632
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,347
I have to either go
forward or backward.

633
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,145
Hua!

634
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:59,349
My body, my mind, and my sword
have to be all in unison.

635
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,891
The idea is you're becoming
one with your weapon.

636
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,051
In the '70s and the '80s,

637
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:34,057
movies increased our interest
in Asian martial arts.

638
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,991
Hey, wouldn't
a fly-swatter be easier.

639
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:42,191
Man who catch fly with
chopstick, accomplish anything.

640
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,765
Today when people hear
the term martial arts

641
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,239
they immediately bring to mind
fighting arts from the East

642
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:55,335
such as karate and taekwondo.

643
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:59,075
There's a more esoteric concept
to kill someone efficiently

644
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:03,916
that is more than just
killing someone and that,

645
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:10,051
in my opinion, is absent within
the Westem swording styles

646
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,721
as opposed to Eastem.

647
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:15,182
In many respects you can say
the West had the same attitude

648
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:19,992
that the Japanese had
but we handled it differently.

649
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:25,125
So there's nothing really
different in these things.

650
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:29,036
We have a tendency
to forget that the West

651
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,166
had their own tradition
of martial arts as well.

652
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:36,076
European fighting skills
tend to sort of get relegated

653
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,946
to something that was very
sort of crude and basic,

654
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,245
which it wasn't.

655
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,081
What's funny is they
don't seem to remember

656
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,088
that the human body's
the same the world over.

657
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,885
And it depends on
how your body moves

658
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,018
and that's govemed
by body mechanics.

659
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:57,124
It's somewhat amusing to have
a dEbute of the oriental

660
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:01,694
martial arts glancing through
a European manual on,

661
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,671
say wrestling,
or hand-to-hand combat and say,

662
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,607
"Oh wow, this is done
almost like the Japanese."

663
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:10,010
Things from Asia and Japan
are viewed as being sort of

664
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:14,380
pinnacle of fighting skills
and as skillful as they were,

665
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,385
we were just as skillful here.

666
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,182
But what we did was
we forgot about them.

667
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:22,225
As you're comparing the two,
look how quickly the West

668
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:26,160
seized on the firearm
and made great use of it.

669
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:30,461
Whereas in Japan it was used
for a brief period of time until

670
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,595
once the Tokugawa Shogunate was
established, they were banned

671
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,607
because this would destroy
the social culture.

672
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:44,011
When a peasant could blast
a samurai from 50 yards away,

673
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,844
it was unthinkable.

674
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,510
Martial arts from the East
of very hierarchical

675
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,247
being orally transmitted
from one person to the next.

676
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,050
Pretty much, it was
a heredity thing

677
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,920
because you had to be
born a samurai.

678
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,791
So it was essentially father
to son, master to disciple.

679
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,229
When of course the big
difference is the schools

680
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:07,669
and some of the oriental schools
continued to flourish.

681
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,741
How far they're teaching
exactly the same sorts of things

682
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:15,778
they taught in the past,
is only anybody's guess.

683
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,008
You remember the game where you
whisper and then you whisper

684
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,482
to the next, by the time
it gets to the end

685
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,246
this thought
is all different.

686
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,822
Eastem martial arts have a long
and continuous history where

687
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,654
in the West martial arts,
with the sword in particular,

688
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,490
died down a lot after
the Renaissance.

689
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:39,168
As the gun improved
the sword was relegated

690
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,902
and became
less and less important.

691
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,240
People stopped training
and teaching in the old arts.

692
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:52,076
There was no necessity, no need
to learn those things anymore.

693
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,082
So we have essentially a break
in the history of the sword

694
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,315
in the Western world.

695
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,193
What was the sword,
and how was it used?

696
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,659
Before practical
swordplay developed

697
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,962
into a gentlemen's ritual
of single dueling,

698
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:16,403
masters of defense
flourished across Europe.

699
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,873
Many of the surviving
manuscripts detailing

700
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:23,811
their combative systems remained
largely obscure for centuries,

701
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,575
until now.

702
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,084
Today historical fencing
studies are on the rise

703
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:33,680
and an unprecedented revival of
these extinct combative systems

704
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,157
is now underway.

705
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:52,499
[music]

706
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,807
The West had its own
martial arts tradition

707
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:36,854
exactly as the Orient did,
exactly the same.

708
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,752
There's been a renaissance,
so to speak,

709
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:43,315
in the study of the sword
offering us a lot of insight

710
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,895
that had been lost in
the several hundred years

711
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,692
since the sword was truly
relevant to combat.

712
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:53,862
The work of people in making
very accurate recreations

713
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:58,237
of the sword in terms of form
as well as the manner in which

714
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,004
they would handle, and then
those martial artists

715
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:04,512
who are taking these
accurate recreations,

716
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,981
moving them in space,
and working out

717
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,986
what was possible
and what isn't possible.

718
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,122
All across Europe, the Americas
and around the world

719
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,222
historical European fight clubs
have emerged with the desire

720
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,963
to study the original
combative systems of both Europe

721
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,561
and the ancient world.

722
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:31,869
They have set out to practice
with a different kind of energy

723
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,501
and intensity separate from
the reenactment

724
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,638
and sport fencing groups.

725
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,342
We're trying to discover
something that's always

726
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,978
been there and has been
forgotten and it's a lot of work

727
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:49,492
to obviously, to try to
understand what was lost.

728
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,728
It's a part of
our history in Europe

729
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,593
and I think that's
very important.

730
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,393
This is actually
our history.

731
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,867
This is actually
how we fought.

732
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,495
Historical European
martial arts is the study

733
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:07,168
of Europe's traditional
fighting systems.

734
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:09,745
I'm doing this because
I had previously studied

735
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,543
Asian martial arts and l
wanted to study martial arts

736
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,517
related to my own culture
and the place that I'm from.

737
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,554
Martial arts from Japan
or China or southeastAsia,

738
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,681
as valid as they are,
I wanted something

739
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,692
that was from
my culture and for me.

740
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,888
I came from a long background of
doing martial arts so I wanted

741
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,455
to see how modem arts compared
to the old arts and it seems

742
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:33,593
that their standard was every
bit as complicated as ours,

743
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,605
and possibly more so.

744
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,178
If you look at modern sport
fencing and kendo, and the like,

745
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,042
they've actually become
simplified versions

746
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,585
of these great complex systems,
which are actually brutal.

747
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,587
It's our past, it's
part of our culture actually.

748
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,390
Today historical European
martial arts groups

749
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,826
are reclaiming the ancient
fighting techniques

750
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:06,335
and studying the diversity
of arms and armor.

751
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,307
For me I think the sword
is like what it was

752
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,966
in the medieval time.

753
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:18,071
What matters is the man
on the other side.

754
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,575
The difference between
the medieval sword

755
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,119
and the Japanese sword

756
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,849
is that the Japanese
put their soul into the sword.

757
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,187
In medieval time,
what matters was

758
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,523
to put the other man
into the sword.

759
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,926
There's no such thing
as just a sword.

760
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,498
It's a weapon
for killing people

761
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,260
and I'm learning how
to do it efficiently.

762
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:41,667
To me the sword is...

763
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,672
cool.

764
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:45,876
For centuries these
ancient fighting skills

765
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,174
For centuries these
ancient fighting skills

766
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,473
have not been practiced.

767
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,312
Historical fencing students
are now leaming to reconstruct

768
00:45:54,418 --> 00:46:00,323
martial arts that have
been until now, extinct.

769
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,153
We're having to try
and rediscover

770
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,524
what the fight masters
of the time were thinking

771
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:09,656
and how they formulated their
techniques and how they evolved.

772
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,895
So there's quite a strong
academic side to it

773
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,903
in the westem martial arts.

774
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:18,406
We're essentially
resurrecting this from books.

775
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,807
Just as European scholars
wrote down every other

776
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,778
art and science,
the science of defense

777
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,816
was also documented
and recorded.

778
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,385
Many of the old
fighting manuals and treaties

779
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,751
that were written during
the 15th and 16th centuries have

780
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:37,850
recently been rediscovered and
are now being studied worldwide.

781
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,395
We focus on mainly
German manuals

782
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:46,436
but also ltalian manuals,
15th century and 16th century.

783
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,062
My personal favorite
is Talhoffer.

784
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,970
For the most part
the ltalian books,

785
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,702
the German books and the Spanish
books on the fighting arts

786
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,575
have been forgotten,
hidden in old libraries

787
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,446
and monasteries in old
archives and universities.

788
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,611
Unfortunately, very little
research had been done on them.

789
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,950
For the most part,
they had not been looked at

790
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,751
for hundreds of years.

791
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,055
Today these old texts are once
again being systematically

792
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:15,188
studied and the ancient fighting
skills are being reborn.

793
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,132
In the text the old masters
actually request

794
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,965
that the students study
the source literature

795
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:25,565
and in one instance they ask
that they add to the text,

796
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,373
bringing their own ideas
to it and expanding upon it.

797
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:33,609
These arts existed in various
forms because they evolved

798
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:39,087
together hand in hand with
the societies that created them.

799
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,487
There's nothing equivalent to
that in any of the other world's

800
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,752
traditional martial arts.

801
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,919
They don't have the volumes
of technical literature

802
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,017
that we have.

803
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,790
This is our westem tradition.

804
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,423
A lot of people leam martial
arts from people who learned it

805
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,002
from somebody else so often
times it's many generations

806
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:56,231
removed from someone
with real combat experience.

807
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,865
These books, they're
written by the source.

808
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,739
There's a play in
Wallerstein, specifically,

809
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,038
where the caption
says something like:

810
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,079
The swordsmen have captured
each others' swords.

811
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,512
I thought how that would
never happen in a fight

812
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,244
and I that following week
I was in a bind with a guy who

813
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,685
spun out and we were standing
just like the play showed,

814
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,278
and so that,
all of a sudden,

815
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,723
becomes like a direct
link back to that time.

816
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:30,230
How did they communicate their
systems to absent third party?

817
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,436
This is combination of words and
images where you have a kind of

818
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,741
notation where you can
almost read the movements

819
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,372
Iike we'd read in music.

820
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:43,419
It combines a ground plan,
where your feet go,

821
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,489
a representation of how
you hold the weapon.

822
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,525
You can see the relationship
between the swords,

823
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:52,094
horizontally as well as
vertically because

824
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:56,655
it casts a shadow and,
of course, scores of postures,

825
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,498
the overall attempt
to convey what the author

826
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,698
wants his student
to understand.

827
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,775
This is the source literature.

828
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,277
This is what's going to tell us
how they did it back then

829
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,939
and this is how we should
be doing it again today.

830
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,041
When one looks at books
on arms and armor,

831
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,712
the incredible detail
and diversity of design

832
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:20,051
in such weaponry is apparent.

833
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,421
Therefore, it stands to reason
that there should be

834
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:27,429
an equally sophisticated manner
of using such weapons.

835
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,193
I was inspired by the works
of a gentleman named

836
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,562
Ewart Oakeshott.

837
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,829
Oakeshott was considered
the world's leading authority

838
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,064
on European swords, on
medieval swords in particular.

839
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:40,735
Most academics look on them
as quaint curiosities,

840
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:45,508
but they have no real concept
of what that sword was used for

841
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,583
or even how it was used.

842
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,744
Ewart made it into
what it was.

843
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,721
These were weapons
made for young men

844
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,122
to kill other young men;

845
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:59,024
a real weapon
used by real people.

846
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,757
The typology of the sword
that Ewart Oakeshott devised

847
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:06,097
included a classification
for all historical blades.

848
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,105
Oakshott's classifications
unlocked the mythical doors that

849
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:15,110
had obscured the true history
of European martial combat.

850
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:29,650
I think if you look at any
Anglo Saxon blades, for example,

851
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,957
or Viking blades, ordinary
warriors might have a long knife

852
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,692
and a spear and a shield,
but they don't have the sword.

853
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,199
There are very few swords

854
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,031
in comparison to the number
of axes or spears.

855
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,698
Spearheads and axes
a blacksmith can make.

856
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,866
You have to be a swordsmith
to get the technology

857
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:50,504
to be able
to make a sword.

858
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,912
I feel a real connection
to the ancient smiths

859
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:57,043
because I like doing it with
the tools that they had,

860
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:01,318
with the fuel that they had,
with just clay and water

861
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:03,325
and a hand hammer
and charcoal.

862
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,520
I have a modern shop, too.

863
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,598
I've got air hammers and
gas forgers and electric kilns

864
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,223
which I used for experimentation
and making sure that

865
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,598
what I think is happening
the ancient way

866
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,864
is actually happening
with some modern tests.

867
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,701
What really affects
me is the chemistry.

868
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:18,740
Say, "Well how do
they make stuff

869
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:22,403
from iron sand,
from dirt, basically?"

870
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,639
It's kind of magic.

871
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,147
The more I learned about
it the more I realized

872
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,716
there's different ways
that different cultures

873
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,809
did it so
I had to try that.

874
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,251
I don't like just
reading about it

875
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,412
and putting a book
on the shelf.

876
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,922
I want to do it until l
get it right which causes

877
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,255
a whole lot of sleepless
nights and a lot of work

878
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,419
and a lot of
trial and error.

879
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:44,592
I feel that a collector
like myself does at least have

880
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:48,637
some utility to those attempting
to rediscover the sword.

881
00:51:48,738 --> 00:51:52,299
I can provide a swordsmith
such as Paul the opportunity

882
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,707
to make very careful
measurements so that

883
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:58,577
some of the original swords
which have survived--

884
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:02,675
rediscovering the way
in which they were put together

885
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:08,088
to give great performance even
with materials and techniques

886
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:14,130
that are primitive by today's
technological standards.

887
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,967
Well, sometimes
there is a debate going:

888
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,433
Is the Japanese sword better?

889
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,594
Or the Chinese sword?

890
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,467
Or the Chinese taught
the Japanese their techniques,

891
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,166
so basically it's just
a refined Chinese sword.

892
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,708
Well, no the European
swords are better--

893
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,973
no whoots,
lndian-type blades are better.

894
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,275
I've been working a lot of these
traditions and I'm finding

895
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:35,317
more similarities of how
they solved their problems

896
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,942
than I am finding differences.

897
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,315
But they have different
ways of doing them,

898
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,116
different ways to stack them.

899
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,247
Some of them using twists

900
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:43,223
some of them didn't use
twisted steel.

901
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,794
But they solved the problems
in a very similar fashion.

902
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,454
And that really intrigued me.

903
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,031
I figured out some things
that were wrong in books,

904
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,759
things that weren't
written in books,

905
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,860
and other things that I feel are
right by actually doing them

906
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,201
and trying them and testing
the swords and breaking swords,

907
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,468
analyzing things.

908
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,010
I enjoyed getting
primary knowledge.

909
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:04,512
Definitely people who smelt
their own steel and test

910
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:08,380
their own blades
and make all things--

911
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:12,751
Where I feel the connection is
sitting back there with the fire

912
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,348
going and pumping the bellows
with everything quiet

913
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:20,088
and just me and
forging that blade.

914
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,571
In 2006 a suitcase in the attic
of a well-loved and deceased

915
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:38,774
archaeologist was literally
saved from history's dust bin.

916
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:46,379
The treasure inside:
a sword, 13 centuries old.

917
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:49,390
Since then the sword has been
tested extensively

918
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,325
by the Royal Armories and
the Bamburgh Research Project

919
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,294
in a effort to
unlock the secrets

920
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,560
of this rare object's
hidden past.

921
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,693
This is one of the most
significant swords found

922
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:03,932
by Brian Hope-Taylor in
his 1960s excavation.

923
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,601
It remained in his possession
up until his death in 2001

924
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:12,648
at which point it came
back to the castle.

925
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,742
When you hold it today it has an
almost mystical quality to it.

926
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,380
It looks like a corroded lump
of metal but in its glory

927
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:24,290
this would have been
an awe inspiring sight.

928
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,385
The x-rays revealed
it to be an extraordinarily

929
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:29,397
sophisticated piece
of technology.

930
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,900
It proved to be
an incredibly important weapon.

931
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,800
One of the most
important weapons,

932
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:38,772
I think it's fair to say,
ever found in Britain.

933
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:42,606
It's actually composed at its
central core of six strands

934
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:46,375
of iron which are worked and
twisted and welded together.

935
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:50,647
On the edge of that is added
a steel seventh element,

936
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,949
if you like, in a technique
called Patton welding.

937
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,957
An iron core with
a forge-welded steel edge,

938
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,392
so you get the flex
and strength of the iron

939
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:02,590
with the extreme
cutting power of the steel.

940
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,133
Which is incredibly tough and
quite springy and flexible,

941
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,668
so it won't break
very easily.

942
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,796
You'd rather have a sword
softer, take a set,

943
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,101
take a bend, than break.

944
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,732
Because a broken sword in
your hand during a battle,

945
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:14,867
you're done.

946
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,946
I wouldn't want to be the smith
that the customer came back to

947
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,811
with his brother's broken
sword in his hand going,

948
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,611
"Hey, why did you make
this so brittle?"

949
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,915
If a warrior would go
into battle with a sword

950
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,888
that was excessively
hard and brittle

951
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,427
the battle for him could be
very short indeed.

952
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:34,497
There's only a handful
like this in the world,

953
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:37,191
probably four or five
in the entire world.

954
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,597
Experts we've talked to in

955
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:42,035
the British Museum
of the Royal Armories

956
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:45,107
don't know of a single example
of a six stranded sword

957
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,143
prior to this one being
identified which does suggest

958
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,075
that they are-
something of this

959
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,411
technological sophistication
is staggeringly rare.

960
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,644
If you were actually have looked
in the home of a medieval

961
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:01,713
warrior or a warrior in another
culture of a century or 2 ago,

962
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:05,090
often the sword would've really,
you know, represented

963
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,596
the most technologically
advanced item in the house.

964
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,156
It represents the epitome of
technology of weapons technology

965
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,292
of its age.

966
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,394
It is, I suppose in
a modern analogy,

967
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,938
something like
a stealth fighter.

968
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,905
The one thing I can say with
certainty is that it's very,

969
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,532
very difficult to
make one of these.

970
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,544
You wouldn't let a smith who
knew the secrets of making

971
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,511
a sword like this
wander about.

972
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,379
They would have been kept
closely guarded by the king.

973
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,850
The information
would have been

974
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,046
an incredibly
jealously guarded secret.

975
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:35,488
The process is very
long and very arduous

976
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,152
and requires an incredible
level of skill.

977
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,695
He would have had
a mastery of metals.

978
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:44,255
He would have known exactly
when to take it from the fire,

979
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,495
which bits to forge, how hard
to hit it, when to hit it,

980
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,663
more importantly
when not to hit it.

981
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,264
One single blow can shatter
a blade like this easily

982
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,468
if it's at
the wrong temperature.

983
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:59,014
Literally tens of thousands of
hammer blows have to be right.

984
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:05,546
When you manufacture a blade
like this you don't just

985
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:08,089
make it, you live it,
and you dream about it

986
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,625
and you think about it
every single moment.

987
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:14,219
It would often reflect
the very best craftsmanship

988
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,731
and some of the best applied
art of that culture.

989
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:24,671
I generally try to see how all
the pieces were put together

990
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,641
because Patton welding is
quite a complicated process.

991
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:31,578
That would have been translated
into a 3-D reconstruction

992
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,876
in the computer of how it
was put together.

993
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:38,545
There is a cleanliness of
line and an economy of weight

994
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:42,853
to make it efficient, durable,
as light as possible.

995
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,588
I'm continually impressed
to no end of how beautiful

996
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,129
all these objects are.

997
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,631
High-end warriors and kings
who can do what they want

998
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,361
with precious metals
and precious stones.

999
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,065
The idea that they don't need
to because the sword itself

1000
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,801
is so precious,
I think, speaks volumes.

1001
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,605
There must have been quite a lot
of thought on the part of

1002
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:08,082
the regular soldier to actually
preserve the blade from damage.

1003
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:11,551
Simply to employ a person of
the caliber of the individual

1004
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,145
who made this would
have cost a fortune,

1005
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,657
would have cost
an absolute fortune.

1006
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:21,025
If you look at old swords you
can tell which ones have had to

1007
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,395
be used to parry
or bone break.

1008
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,991
You can tell
bone breaks, too.

1009
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:29,629
It's actually notched and
chipped along both sides which

1010
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:32,537
does suggest that it has been
used repeatedly in battle.

1011
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,975
A sword of this quality would
have been owned by someone

1012
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,411
who was incredibly important.

1013
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,075
It was probably owned by one
of the kings of Northumbria,

1014
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,414
possibly by several of
them which does suggest

1015
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,283
200 or 300 years of use.

1016
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:47,481
So it may of well
been an heirloom of

1017
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,081
the Northumbrian Royal House,
passed down from generations

1018
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:52,957
basically from
one king to another.

1019
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:56,520
A sword like this, I think,
would have inspired

1020
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,362
absolute terror.

1021
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:02,063
When you're in battle and you
see a sword of this quality

1022
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,004
coming towards you, you would
know immediately that the person

1023
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,975
who wielded a sword like this
was someone who had spent

1024
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,602
their entire life training
to be a warrior,

1025
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,114
who lived their
life by the sword.

1026
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:30,622
[music]

1027
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:51,921
Contrary to popular notions,
the medieval long sword

1028
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:55,049
Contrary to popular notions,
the medieval long sword

1029
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:58,616
is surprisingly light, weighing
an average of only 3 pounds

1030
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,891
and capable of
blindingly fast attacks.

1031
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:05,331
Sword combatants use both
footwork and the ability to

1032
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,893
manipulate timing and distance
to enhance the swords cutting

1033
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,269
and thrusting capabilities.

1034
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:14,036
One of the primary principles
of swordplay is to attack

1035
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,976
and defend at the same time
where every attack contains

1036
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:22,040
and defense and every defense
contains a counter attack.

1037
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,915
Picking up a sharp implement
and cutting someone,

1038
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,318
you know you can teach
that very quickly,

1039
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:28,913
however the strategy
behind it--when to attack,

1040
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:32,426
when not attack--that is
a very mental pursuit.

1041
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:37,397
The subtle movements,
the deceptions, the trickery,

1042
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:41,459
where I look over here, move
and strike someplace else.

1043
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:48,039
When you start fencing
with medieval swords,

1044
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,612
then you discover that
there is more to it

1045
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,578
than actually using
just the blade.

1046
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:55,480
There's different angles
and lots of things that

1047
01:00:55,585 --> 01:01:00,579
it's not obvious for the normal
person in using the sword.

1048
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,817
Levering with the sword to
try to disarm the other guy,

1049
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:07,624
bashing with the cross, pommel.

1050
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,631
Historically European
martial artists believe that

1051
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:13,327
it is important to study
and practice the techniques

1052
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:16,803
with great energy
and intensity.

1053
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,897
From the manuals we
can see the diversity

1054
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,238
of the ancient masters' skills.

1055
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,472
They studied
two weapon combinations:

1056
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:29,540
sword with shields,
swords with buckler,

1057
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:32,314
and swords with daggers.

1058
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,117
Often they considered
unarmored and well as

1059
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:38,489
armored fighting,
mounted as well as on foot.

1060
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:41,495
Generally the ancient masters
always integrated armed

1061
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:45,226
and unarmed skills,
never practicing fencing

1062
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:49,430
without also including grappling
and wrestling techniques.

1063
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:53,236
Most of these combats
probably ended on the ground.

1064
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:08,089
When he's down on the ground
and I'm using all my weight

1065
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:11,217
to shove my sword through him,
then I can penetrate.

1066
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,954
In order to
comprehend the sword,

1067
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:15,053
you need to comprehend all
the techniques surrounding

1068
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,928
the actual use of swords.

1069
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:21,003
Contrary to what you see at
Ren fairs and what you see

1070
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,834
in Hollywood movies,
armored fighting is not about

1071
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,737
using the edge of the sword.

1072
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,606
It's not gonna penetrate that
breast plate or that plate leg

1073
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,077
armor so they have to come up
with another way of defeating

1074
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,014
a man in armor and that method
is primarily half swording.

1075
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,745
The manuals are full
of this technique.

1076
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,845
I grab my own blade and l
use it as a thrusting weapon.

1077
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:44,552
I can shorten the blade by doing
this and make it much stiffer

1078
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:48,596
so I have accuracy and enough
strike to penetrate his armor.

1079
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,599
I have to thrust it in,
and put some weight behind it

1080
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,225
and really drive it.

1081
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:56,863
Fencing does not allow you
to use the left hand

1082
01:02:56,973 --> 01:03:01,342
and I have heard people
tell you or say that

1083
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,208
the left hand
is for balance.

1084
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:05,940
It has nothing to
do with balance.

1085
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:07,913
We're constantly
using this hand,

1086
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:12,454
so if he makes an attack-
if I have to I'll use elbow,

1087
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:17,151
forearm,
anything I need to.

1088
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:21,560
Now in classical fencing
or dueling manuals

1089
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:25,691
you see slapping the blade
as a constant thing.

1090
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,202
In fact, you will see that most
of the time with the left hand

1091
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,933
up here in a position to slap.

1092
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,703
He makes a thrust
and I have to get to here,

1093
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,142
I'm gonna disarm him.

1094
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,042
You have to do freeplay,
you have to do

1095
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,047
an intense amount
of mock combat.

1096
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,312
You have to do it with as
realistic a way as possible.

1097
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:59,825
[music]

1098
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,157
Today we do a lot
of sitting.

1099
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,923
You know we sit in
front of our computers.

1100
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,759
We sit in front of
our televisions.

1101
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,699
We sit on the way to work,
then we get to work and we sit.

1102
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,498
Then we go home and we sit again
and then we're laying down.

1103
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:37,664
In the medieval renaissance
eras people didn't.

1104
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:40,298
They did a lot of walking
and a lot of riding

1105
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,467
and a lot of running.

1106
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:44,375
I think we have no idea how much
like rawhide these people must

1107
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,278
have been back in, you know,
5 or 6 centuries ago.

1108
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,443
I think we're very soft
nowadays despite our efforts

1109
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,454
to remain,
you know, fit.

1110
01:04:56,225 --> 01:05:06,123
[music]

1111
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:08,838
I was a sword nut at 12, so me
and one of my friends went out.

1112
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:12,239
I was a sword nut at 12, so me
and one of my friends went out.

1113
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,104
We immediately went
"bang, bang, bang,"

1114
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,871
started fencing with them.

1115
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:20,938
And after it was over with,
I had two hacksaws because

1116
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,416
you know it just
ruins the edge.

1117
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,285
Well I was shocked and upset
because this wasn't what

1118
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,358
happened in the movies.

1119
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:34,157
Movie combat is really a curious
undertaking because it's

1120
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,164
not very realistic, generally.

1121
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:42,169
It doesn't portray how
the historical weaponry

1122
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,364
actually performs and handles.

1123
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:47,567
It's one of my favorite themes
actually that that metallic

1124
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:51,408
noise that a sword makes
coming out of a scabbard

1125
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:52,981
which makes no sense.

1126
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,947
Swords don't make a noise
when they come out, you know.

1127
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,712
It's, life as a fantasy.

1128
01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:02,018
It doesn't reflect the way
human beings actually behave

1129
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,615
in violent,
personal armed combat.

1130
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:05,887
Mainly when you see
movies nowadays,

1131
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,793
they always focus
on techniques

1132
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:12,231
even in moves displaying
medieval Europe.

1133
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:16,294
They always focus on Asian
techniques and et cetera,

1134
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,568
and that's not our way,
so to speak.

1135
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,041
Westem martial arts,
you know, that's, you know,

1136
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:26,581
whether it be English,
ltalian, French, Spanish,

1137
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:30,049
there are specifics to those
styles and those weapons

1138
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,450
that are ignored in most
of the movies these days.

1139
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:35,490
It's like a huge pot of soup
with many, many ingredients.

1140
01:06:35,591 --> 01:06:37,218
You know they're
hybrids, really.

1141
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,386
They're not true to westem
martial arts, I wouldn't say,

1142
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,589
for the most part because
they're mixing in elements

1143
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,064
of Asian martial arts that
have no place there,

1144
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,634
really if you want
to be realistic.

1145
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,465
So you have a little bit
kung fu, and a little bit of,

1146
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,004
you know, a little
bit of everything.

1147
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,564
Most of the time a lot of
these movies are very good.

1148
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:57,544
The problem that I have with
it is that a lot of people

1149
01:06:57,646 --> 01:07:01,912
in the audience think this
is the way you use a sword.

1150
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,816
It's purely for entertainment;
this is true.

1151
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,945
But it certainly
makes my job harder.

1152
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,923
We teach people: No, your
sword's not going to cut through

1153
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,494
a guy with plate armor;
no you can't cut through--

1154
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,825
cut a Z in somebody's chest.

1155
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,694
But you can do
other things and they're

1156
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,032
even more interesting
because they're real.

1157
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,566
Many who study classical fencing
and European martial arts

1158
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:30,270
believe that if you give the
audience more realism combined

1159
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:34,782
with credible performances then
they will enjoy and embrace it.

1160
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,717
I think that now there's
a generation of moviegoers and

1161
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:41,916
readers who are ready for that,
and they're asking for that.

1162
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:45,118
Classical fences and historical
European martial artists

1163
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,060
and scholars have now shown
that there is a wonderful craft

1164
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,395
out there that has been lost but
that can now be made

1165
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,161
to exist again.

1166
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,567
There have, recently there
are some movies that have been

1167
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,105
focusing a little bit on
European martial arts.

1168
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:01,370
Good examples of films that
feature combat based on specific

1169
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:06,107
historical swordsmanship include
"Rob Roy," "Gladiator,"

1170
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:11,312
"Troy," "Kingdom of Heaven"
and "Alatriste."

1171
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:17,387
In some few cases people are
more in tune and do a better job

1172
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:21,327
of researching and being true
to the style of the period.

1173
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,364
As I said,
Bob does this very well.

1174
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:25,229
For example,
in "Alatriste,"

1175
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:31,295
they're not what Bob would call
sword-slapping scenes, you know.

1176
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:35,810
His goal is always
credibility, naturalism,

1177
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,210
fights the way they would be
and the reason that people are

1178
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:42,250
careful going in and they're,
once they commit they commit

1179
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,842
fully is because even
a small wound in those times-

1180
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,548
infection and you could
die just from that.

1181
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:51,023
You're going in to kill and
it's over with very quickly.

1182
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:54,927
They were violent, you know,
shockingly violent at times

1183
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,328
and there were very real,
dangerous consequences

1184
01:08:57,433 --> 01:09:00,766
to mixing it up with swords.

1185
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:10,844
In many regards it is to the
high fantasy of film that we are

1186
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:15,349
indebted for today's resurgence
of western martial arts.

1187
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,511
Movies have inspired many
talented individuals

1188
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,612
to take up the sword
in an effort

1189
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,557
to rediscover
its true martial significance.

1190
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,565
The resurgence of authentic
European martial arts has been

1191
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,032
growing exponentially over time.

1192
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:37,731
Over the years it has actually
become influential in cinema.

1193
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,434
Historical European martial
arts are neither reenactment

1194
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,272
nor sport fencing.

1195
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:45,506
They're in a category
all of their own.

1196
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:49,641
This fresh approach to training
takes history into account

1197
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:54,655
striving to improve both its
practice and authenticity.

1198
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:18,747
Our lives don't depend
on this craft.

1199
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,476
Our lives don't depend
on this craft.

1200
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,983
Nobody's going to challenge us
to a duel at the mall

1201
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,177
with a rapier.

1202
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,981
Nobody's going to ambush
us in the parking lot

1203
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,283
with a bastard sword,
so we have to have

1204
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,415
altemative reasons for
why we're doing this.

1205
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:33,723
We do this, I think,
because it needs to be done.

1206
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:36,389
And hopefully it will increase
everyone's understanding

1207
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:41,265
and awareness of how
European warfare was conducted.

1208
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,703
They will be appreciated for
as effective and as elegant

1209
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:50,074
and as useful as anything the
rest of the world has to offer.

1210
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,840
All these things
that have been forgotten

1211
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,676
needs to be found again.

1212
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:57,684
In an age where truth
seems so far from us,

1213
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:01,278
symbol of the sword
shines bright.

1214
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:04,848
The journey it takes to
become good with your blade,

1215
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,361
to become good with your sword,
that takes a lot of time,

1216
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,329
a lot of effort, and
that changes a person,

1217
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,626
matures a person.

1218
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,224
Obviously in the process
it is going to teach you

1219
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:14,393
to become a better man.

1220
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:18,132
We hope to be--who knows--
someday a better swordsman,

1221
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,471
maybe even mildly
average swordsman.

1222
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:24,876
It would be more than
I would ever expect.

1223
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:31,383
What story can
an ancient sword tell us?

1224
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,217
I can't say I really
understand the sword as of yet,

1225
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,723
but hopefully one day
I will be there.

1226
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:39,453
Eventually, I would like
my studies to take me to

1227
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,086
the great heights
of beating my instructor-

1228
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:43,994
the first woman
to ever do so.

1229
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,967
Sword fighting is kind of
different and looked like

1230
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:53,975
good fun and I've been a couple
of times and it is good fun.

1231
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,203
While those who train today
have only begun to scratch

1232
01:11:56,312 --> 01:12:02,911
the surface, they are slowly
beginning to lift the shadow.

1233
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,418
You know, it's all
those dreams that

1234
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:08,888
you really can't have any
more 'cause you've grown up.

1235
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,357
People are often looking
backwards in time to see

1236
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,655
whereabouts we've come from.

1237
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:17,721
Even in the '50s,
progress was happening.

1238
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,768
People were looking forward
and now we've reached a point,

1239
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:24,100
I think, where we're
looking all around,

1240
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,664
trying to find meaning
to what's happening.

1241
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:31,837
People need to feel that sense
of identity with their past

1242
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:33,244
and their history.

1243
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,180
There's nothing
richer than history.

1244
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:36,876
History is, you know,
history is, all of us

1245
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,475
over thousands of years.

1246
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:40,919
I've been doing martial
arts for over 20 years now.

1247
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:44,254
I've noticed my body changing
and I'm getting older and things

1248
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,725
are a little bit
more difficult.

1249
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,557
However, I don't
give up on that.

1250
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:51,121
I train myself harder so it
becomes very, very mental.

1251
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:57,229
Your body goes away, but your
mind should stay sharp.

1252
01:12:57,339 --> 01:13:00,399
So I get a bit more gray
and a little more stooped.

1253
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,534
As long as I can
swing a hammer,

1254
01:13:02,644 --> 01:13:04,805
I'm just going to
keep doing this.

1255
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:08,747
Within the sword lies the power
both to protect and to rule.

1256
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,685
It can be used for great
evil or for great good;

1257
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:16,451
to control a people or stop
the hordes of a tyrant;

1258
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:21,427
to break the rightful will of a
nation or to set the truth free

1259
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:26,365
and every man a king
over his own fate.

1260
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:33,237
A good swordsman does not take
lightly unsheathing his sword.

1261
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:36,140
If your sword is out, it means
that you intend to use it.

1262
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:40,147
It's a pity, really, that we
couldn't fight with rapiers

1263
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,412
today rather than guns.

1264
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:47,956
It's a pity that gunpowder
was invented, in my mind,

1265
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:51,583
because we would probably
still be fighting with rapiers.

1266
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:55,629
And I'd be good at it.

1267

1268
