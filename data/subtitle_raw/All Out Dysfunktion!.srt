1
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,822
Everybody get
the fuck out!

2
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,944
Fuck.

3
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:35,280
Testing.

4
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,416
-One, two.
-Red leather,
yellow leather.

5
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,518
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

6
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,887
- Red leather, yellow leather.
-

7
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,291
hallway,
gator's room, check.

8
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,260
Carrie.

9
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,896
Ooh, Carrie
on the toilet seat.

10
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,398
And she did,
she did, she did.

11
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,566
She looked like somebody--

12
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,370
hurry up and brush
your fucking tongue,

13
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,305
'cause I have

14
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,707
Fucking cracker!

15
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,443
White bitch.
Yeah, I said it.

16
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,612
Get your fucking ass
out the bathroom,
i got shit to do.

17
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,247
I know what the fuck
you do all the time in there,

18
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,881
-shit, shit, shit.
-I see your nasty ass.

19
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,316
Fucking keeping
my fucking customers

20
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,317
waiting and shit.

21
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,318
Yeah, yeah,

22
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,586
it's fucking still on.

23
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,821
I'll be there
in a fucking hour.

24
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,489
Don't fuck me over, okay?

25
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,524
Carrie, I will break
the fucking door down.

26
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:20,826
Fucking white
cracker bitch...

27
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,832
Ooh,
this bitch don't know.

28
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,500
You fuckin' stupid...

29
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,537
Don't you know
i got shit to do, bitch?

30
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,340
Yeah, you'd better chill
with that shit,

31
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,976
don't you fucking throw that
at me.

32
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,978
Don't you know I will wipe
your honky ass up, bitch?

33
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,613
Cum dumpster bitch.

34
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,848
Crazy ass white bitch,

35
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,316
all skinny,
throwing up and shit.

36
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,917
Who the fuck
does that shit?

37
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,819
You ain't never gonna have
an ass like this, bitch!

38
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,721
Never!

39
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,295
Who the hell are you?

40
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:57,963
Yeah, excuse you, too.

41
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,467
I don't like your face.

42
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,874
Okay, boys,
where was I?

43
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,044
Mama's gonna take care
of all you nasty suckers.

44
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,879
And by the time
I'm done with y'all,

45
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:18,950
y'all gonna be some
dirty ass wet noodles.

46
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,752
You motherfuckers
want to see me play

47
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,787
with this right?

48
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,490
Well, since
you're all platinum members

49
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,759
of pleasure's paradise,

50
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,695
you motherfuckers

51
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:34,466
are gonna get
a look-and-see.

52
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,903
Oh, yes.

53
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,071
Oh!

54
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,410
Oh, yeah,
oh, I'm about to squirt.

55
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,113
I'm gonna give it to you
in the style of an orangutan.

56
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,782
Oh, yes!
Yes!

57
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:54,519
I'm gonna squirt!
Oh!

58
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,956
Oh, I'm gonna give you
the punch of a donkey!

59
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,424
Oh!

60
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,605
What the fuck is going on
around here?

61
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,975
Â¡Ay, "cariba"!
Buenos dias, mamacita!

62
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,377
Shut up!

63
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,611
Have you not seen
all the people

64
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,846
fucking parading
around the house?

65
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,581
Have you noticed
that your nose

66
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,815
is having
a heavy flow day?

67
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,016
Oh, you did,
'cause you jammed

68
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,486
a tampon up there,
good for you!

69
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,887
Shut the fuck up,
all right?

70
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,822
Your breath smells
like a fucking slave ship.

71
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,823
Wow!

72
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,393
Oh, fuck!

73
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,761
Look, you've lived here
long enough,

74
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,596
you know pretty
much anything goes.

75
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,965
Really?
What the fuck is that?

76
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,467
Ah, relax.
It's for my new indie film.

77
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,436
-Gonna be hot! Pa-pow!
-Who raised you?

78
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,605
-I mean, seriously.
-My mom, okay?

79
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,507
I had a very nice upbringing,
thank you.

80
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,809
Listen, you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

81
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,711
Was that you vacuuming
at like, 5:00 am?

82
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,045
You know what?
Eat me, gator.

83
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,680
Nobody scratches
anything for me around here,

84
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:56,882
so fuck off, okay?

85
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,617
Well, maybe
if you had better skin,

86
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,018
we'd be more willing
to scratch things for you.

87
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,623
Shit.

88
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,861
It's just
a natural reaction

89
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,596
I've had
ever since I was little.

90
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,001
Every time mama
comes real good,

91
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,836
I cry, that's all.

92
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,542
That's it
for pleasure's paradise today.

93
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:27,078
I'll see all you
dirty motherfuckers tomorrow.

94
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,488
--Whoopsie.

95
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,457
Shit.

96
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,728
Grow some courage.

97
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,031
Always hiding
behind your mask.

98
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,699
Tough horny guy
"curry stick"

99
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,534
- with a long schlong.

100
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,536
How is my little son
doing?

101
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,672
Have you been able
to find a job

102
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,007
with that beautiful,
shiny American degree?

103
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,076
Why are you sweating?

104
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,078
The house is a little hot.

105
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,581
That is all,
that's why I'm sweating.

106
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,584
I'm still freelancing,
web coding

107
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,019
and trying to find
steady work.

108
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,955
But I must
talk to you later, huh?

109
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,156
Why are you rushing me?

110
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,693
Please, papa.
I need more time.

111
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,961
It's really hot.

112
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,696
-More time?
-I need to clean.

113
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:20,065
Huh, you want to live
like a transient forever?

114
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,067
No, I will not let you
live like that.

115
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,503
You will live like
a very good Indian
hard-working boy.

116
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,138
American culture is not like
Indian culture, papa.

117
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,107
That is why I'm saying
American culture

118
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,775
is very different
from Indian culture.

119
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,010
Indian culture
is very good culture.

120
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,879
Two more months,
no more, that is it.

121
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,747
Yes, papa.

122
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:38,116
And one more thing.

123
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,653
How is that
American woman?

124
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,623
I understand American woman
very good with the mouth.

125
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,724
Huh?

126
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,693
No hands?
Your mother--

127
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,961
not very good
with the mouth.

128
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:53,031
Bite sometime.
Eyes pop out, not good.

129
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,033
-Papa, please.
-What happen?

130
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,635
Your eyes pop out?

131
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:04,042
Don't be shy, ranjit,
i see the way you look at me.

132
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,977
You nasty.

133
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,128
Ranjit, what up?

134
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,831
Dude, I finally figured out
how to make my fingers Dutch.

135
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,135
You hungry?
Want some yum-yums?

136
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,271
Stupid huta.
That's disgusting.

137
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,073
Oh, god,

138
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,609
things are not settling well
from last night.

139
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:40,111
Where I come from,
people do not burp this way

140
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,147
in front of others.

141
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,915
You are a dirty pashu.

142
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,584
Wait, what's pashu?

143
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:49,087
Pashu,
an animal, a beast,

144
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,056
a brute.

145
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,824
That is so sweet.

146
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,727
I should get that
tattooed on my heart.

147
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:56,828
Pashu.

148
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,699
-You are worthless.
-Mm-hmm.

149
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,200
Where's my coffee?

150
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,302
Sorry, dude,
i had a production meeting

151
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,605
this morning
and I was tired.

152
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,840
Needed to drink it all.

153
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:13,011
What the fuck, pashu?
This is expensive coffee, man.

154
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,615
-Wasn't that good.
-I'm tired of you
taking advantage of my things.

155
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,083
Name four things.

156
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,852
I buy rice,
and you're burning the rice.

157
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,922
-One time.
-I buy curry, and you are
burning the curry.

158
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,357
You're right,
that one's on me.

159
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:27,959
-That one was my fault.
-My coffee's from India.

160
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,260
Look, your coffee,

161
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,096
I'll buy you some more
tomorrow, okay?

162
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,965
--Good god, this guy is crazy.

163
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,101
-Who?
-That black guy, Tyrell.

164
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,702
Why he gotta be black, huh?

165
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:39,237
He's got a name.

166
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,172
I don't go around calling you
brown guy ranjit.

167
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,941
Because he's black.

168
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,876
I'm gonna call you
brown guy ranjit, then.

169
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,879
Fuck you, pashu,
i mean, who labels everything?

170
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,249
By name, taste,
spoilage dated,

171
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,884
perfectly matching
containers?

172
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,253
Have you seen him open a door?

173
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,788
Guys, guys,
good morning, good morning,

174
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,423
-good morning.
-Good morning.

175
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,924
Hi! Can you please
do me a favor?

176
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,159
If you're going
to talk about me,

177
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,161
-just do it to my face.
-Fair enough.

178
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,131
And can you please,
please not touch my things?

179
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,767
Especially you, gator,
with your filthy hands.

180
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,705
Well, excuse me
and my filthy hands.

181
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:16,041
Calm down, Tyrell.
We're just playing around.

182
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,143
Yeah, man,
just playing around,

183
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,145
it's not like
you're the only person

184
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:21,913
on the entire planet

185
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,115
who uses a handkerchief
to touch his weenie.

186
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,316
All right,
let's just be honest.

187
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,951
Just because
my state of cleanliness

188
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,186
is on a higher level
of consciousness

189
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,721
than both
you two neanderthals,

190
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:30,922
it's gonna protect me
from bacteria

191
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,158
eating me
from the inside out.

192
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,094
Did you know
that warmth and moisture

193
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,396
are the key components
to bacterial growth?

194
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,365
Hmm? Have you ever heard of
salmonella?

195
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,401
E. Coli?
Listeria?

196
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,136
Bro, the bottom line

197
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,105
is that even
a kitchen counter

198
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,442
has 50 times
more bacteria on it

199
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,943
than a toilet seat.

200
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:55,413
Not mine.
My Booty's pretty clean.

201
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,482
-I sit down to pee.
-I know.

202
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,484
What?
You think that's weird?

203
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,919
Ask him how he poops.

204
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:01,953
How do you shit?

205
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,122
I use a squatty potty.

206
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,725
You know it really comes out
silky and smooth.

207
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,959
That's what
you keep telling me.

208
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,360
But that's not the point.

209
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,895
If the earth opened up
and beelzebub hit you

210
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,197
with fire and brimstone,

211
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,299
you better believe
that I would be licking

212
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,768
a toilet seat
way before I would lick

213
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,103
a kitchen cutting board.

214
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,771
-That's fucked up, dude.
-No, no, no, no.

215
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:22,407
And I'm not done.
Did you also know--

216
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,111
look at this--
that a kitchen sponge

217
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,847
is one of the most
bacterially infested items

218
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:29,848
in the entire household?

219
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,516
A single bacterial cell

220
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:34,085
can multiply into
over 80 million cells

221
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,420
in 24 hours.

222
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,489
That is some serious
"fuck-you-up" shit,

223
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:40,425
so while you guys
are running around,

224
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,228
scratching your balls
and rubbing your asses

225
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,829
and touching
the kitchen sponge,

226
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,265
I will keep my sanitizer
and I will be safe.

227
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,968
And while you
two little germies

228
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,771
are crying bloody mercy,
pissing out of every single

229
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,439
little baby orifice
in your body,

230
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,142
dehydrated
as a fuckin' arab,

231
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,443
I will be okay.

232
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,844
So, do me a favor

233
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,347
and keep your hands
off my shit!

234
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,549
What the hell
are you pencil pricks

235
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,284
-hemming and hawing about?
-This is very sad.

236
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,286
You brown-nosing,
circle-jerking teabaggers

237
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,420
make some coffee yet?

238
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,389
My Stein is dry.

239
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,358
We would, but Mr. snuff film
drank it all.

240
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,326
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
you touched my tupperware

241
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,928
and you're a snitch?

242
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,463
--That's why your mama

243
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,064
has three teeth.

244
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:24,202
Huh? One in her mouth,
and two in her pocket.

245
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,304
-What's my mother
got to do with any--
-cut it out!

246
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,409
I am tired of playing
momma dearest around here,

247
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,111
so you ball-slappers
best make nice

248
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:37,048
or I'll whip out
the metal hangers!

249
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,585
Ranjit,
here's ten bucks.

250
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:43,888
Go get us all some coffee,
and none of that cheap shit,

251
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,990
I want something nice
that they enslave people

252
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,392
in south America for.

253
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:51,029
And keep your mitts
off people's shit!

254
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,397
- Why me? He--

255
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,999
cap it!

256
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,402
"Speed your way"
easy chairs,

257
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:59,170
your hope
for elderly scooters.

258
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,406
This is clarelle,
how can I help you?

259
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,913
It's a bit of a shitter,
but it's got potential.

260
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,483
It's kinda shitty.
Fuckin' shitty.

261
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,052
You're looking at the star
of fashion week

262
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,486
if you can pull this off.

263
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,922
-Yeah, pull that shit all off.
-High ceilings.

264
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,325
-But we don't have any color.
Hello!
-Calm down, price.

265
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,093
Why is it always me?

266
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,494
Come on, I'll show you
why we really came here.

267
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,629
There's four bedrooms
down the hall

268
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,331
that aren't even
being used,

269
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,632
and wait till
you guys see this.

270
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,541
- Okay,
pull her arms back.

271
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:41,446
Yeah, that's good.
That's how we like it.

272
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:45,216
Mmm-hmm.
Now arch your back, baby.

273
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,086
Arch your back.

274
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:51,356
Now ride him.

275
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,991
Pull out slow.

276
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,626
Slower!

277
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,662
Slower!

278
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,133
And punch!

279
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:05,003
Cut!
God damn it, cut!

280
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,539
And what is this?
Amateur day?

281
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,576
And what is that?
Huh?

282
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,513
Your dick is flapping around
like cock snot.

283
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,052
Hello!
Anybody home?

284
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,388
Pleasure,
do me a favor

285
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,056
and get into makeup

286
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:28,159
while I talk to silly putty
super schlong over here.

287
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,261
'Cause your face
look like shit.

288
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,096
What you say,
motherfucker?

289
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,969
Now listen here,
miss ghetto fab,

290
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,271
and listen good.

291
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,507
Now I don't wanna hear
any flim flam

292
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,208
coming out of your mouth,

293
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,244
'cause you're fucking
with your money,

294
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:50,048
and more importantly,
you're fucking with my money,

295
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,650
and I don't take
too kindly to that shit.

296
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,455
Now, you're the star
of this fucking show,

297
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,425
and if it was up to me,
I'd bury your head

298
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:04,162
in a mound of pillows,
and unlucky for me

299
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:09,033
my bosses didn't hire me
to shoot "ass pounders 254,"

300
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:13,638
so, taking
your beat-up face

301
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,341
and burying it
in a mound of pillows

302
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,743
isn't exactly an option.

303
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,980
Take your bootylicious ass
to makeup,

304
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:26,150
don't pass, go,
collect $200,

305
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,219
till I fucking say so!

306
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:32,056
Makeup!
Fix her fuckin' gorilla chin.

307
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:35,493
-I need a money shot!
-I don't like to see her
treated this way.

308
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,395
Dude,
she's a porn chick,

309
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,498
she takes platoons of penises
in her butt for a paycheck.

310
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,167
I don't care.
She's still a person.

311
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,737
Hey!
One fucking voice!

312
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,708
Where you goin', punjab?

313
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,177
Know what?
Fuck you, man.

314
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,347
Don't talk
about my people.

315
00:16:56,349 --> 00:17:00,685
I don't have to take this shit
anymore, okay?

316
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,722
That was hot.

317
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:06,357
Now that that's settled.

318
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,194
-I'd fuck him.
-Hey, assy.

319
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,630
My name is azeebo.

320
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,565
Oh, I know what
they call you.

321
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,235
I write
your two dollar contracts.

322
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,704
Hey, hey, there are
a lot of people around.

323
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,245
You think I give a fuck?

324
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,579
What's my name?

325
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,082
Mike mix under thunder.

326
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:34,652
What's my name,
down syndrome dick?

327
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,421
Mike mix under thunder.

328
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:40,525
Say it like you're getting
your ass hole licked.

329
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,461
Mike mix under thunder!

330
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,230
Yes! Now get used
to that six syllable name.

331
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,834
You know why I get
a six syllable name?

332
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,103
'Cause
I'm fucking successful.

333
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,138
So, remember that sound,

334
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,807
because I can make
or break your career

335
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,776
just like that,
and all you'll hear

336
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:03,414
is the sound
of Mike mix under thunder

337
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,183
fucking you in the ass

338
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,451
unless you get
that black rhino

339
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,452
to turn to steel.

340
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,619
You got me?

341
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,754
Yes.

342
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,622
Hey, fluffer!

343
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,459
Mouth, dick, go!

344
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,462
Okay, everybody,
take five.

345
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,330
Come here, mufasa.

346
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:21,532
My name is azeebo!

347
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,801
Whatever, zebra.

348
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,637
Zebra?
This is racial profiling.

349
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:27,805
I'm not happy

350
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,173
with these
working conditions--

351
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,710
oh, oh, oh.

352
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,213
That's good.

353
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,215
What do you think?

354
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,618
This is more like it.

355
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,720
I like it.
I like it a lot.

356
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,622
Okay.

357
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,793
Stage here.

358
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,395
Got to check
the breaker box
for secondary power.

359
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,598
We've got serious capacity
here.

360
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,133
Vip area down there.

361
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,834
Yes, baby.
Can do.

362
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,170
-Glitter.
-Bruce, what about security?

363
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,304
Just the usual, man.

364
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,439
It's going deep.

365
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,307
Okay, price, on the dial.

366
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,309
I want you to reach out
to all the social networks.

367
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,544
We got a new venue, guys.

368
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,247
-Get on that dial, bitch.
-On it.

369
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,349
Hey, there, get up.
Let me take a look at you.

370
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,917
Do you perform?

371
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,153
-I...
-And what's with the mask?

372
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,388
Uh...

373
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,392
If-- if you can smell sex,
then sex is airborne.

374
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,694
You can see it on the couch
and some on his skin

375
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,229
and I can maybe
smell it on your breath.

376
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,298
-Do you like to fuck?
-I don't--

377
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,900
'cause I got
some pretty hot ass here.

378
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,234
Yeah, she's hot.

379
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,736
Yeah, no,
i can see it now.

380
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,337
Look it.
"Ebony rising."

381
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,672
--Fuck, yeah.

382
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,776
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Pole vaultin' the moon.

383
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,611
You've got good throw.

384
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,713
I can make it
a interracial thing.

385
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,416
- But I don't pole vault.
- I didn't even make varsity.

386
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,351
-Crystal.
-I-- no.

387
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,420
-Get your white ass over here.
-That's-- yeah, that's--

388
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,422
-yes, Mike?
-Hi.

389
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,790
Suck his cock.

390
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,559
Hey, there, big winner.

391
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,860
Gator, gator, ah!

392
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,362
Okay, okay,
armadillo, armadillo.

393
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,498
-Camp, camp, camp.
-What are you, a "fage"?

394
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,799
No.

395
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,635
-Hey, David.
-It's slurp and burp.

396
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,804
God, you're so loud.

397
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,573
What are you doing? No!

398
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,441
Can I play
with the big winner?

399
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,976
No, you can't play
with the big winner.

400
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,744
-I need some help, gator.
-Yep, solution right here.

401
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,479
I love blowjobs.
I love 'em.

402
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,448
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

403
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,250
Let's go! Let's go!
I am ready, Mike.

404
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,586
-Just give it to me straight.
-I am strong like spear.

405
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,888
-It's too many germs.
-Let me get this right.

406
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,257
You are turning down
getting some

407
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,827
of the greatest head
of your life

408
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,562
from one
of the hottest girls

409
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,830
-in my library--
-it's nice to meet you.

410
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,599
...because you
don't like germs?

411
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,669
Yeah, that's--
that pretty much sums it up.

412
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,504
Well, you better get
used to it,

413
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,608
you pencil-poker
piece of pussy lint!

414
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,310
Welcome to L.A.!

415
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,714
Oh, yes, Mike.
I am ready.

416
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,415
First a.D.,
can I talk straight

417
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,383
to the talent?

418
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,921
Oh.

419
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,628
Grow some fucking balls.

420
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,596
"Welcome to L.A."

421
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,937
Look,
there's one more thing.

422
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,640
There's this old lady,
clarelle, who manages
this place.

423
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:16,974
I don't think
she's gonna be cool

424
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,776
with us having a party here
last minute.

425
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,411
I'll deal with
the roommates, but...

426
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,046
Don't tell me you dragged me
all the way here

427
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,881
to ghetto valley to tell me
that it's not gonna work.

428
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,683
I'm giving you $2,000

429
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,718
and enough coke
to melt your face.

430
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,321
-Face, bitch.
-Let me explain something
to you.

431
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,456
I don't care about ravers.
I don't care about music.

432
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,558
And I don't give
a fuck about people.

433
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,827
What I care about
is my money and my time,

434
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,763
so don't fuck
with my money or my time.

435
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,998
In about three hours,
I'm on a plane to Miami.

436
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,633
If you don't come through,

437
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,869
you're gonna face a shitstorm
of unimaginable.

438
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,338
So, now what are you gonna do
about this old lady, clarelle?

439
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,572
I don't know.

440
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:52,009
Can we knock her out
or something?

441
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,312
How old is she?

442
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:57,915
-Sixty or 70?
-Fuck.

443
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,984
We can't fuck her up.
We can knock her out, though.

444
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,619
Oh, every day at 6:00,

445
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,388
she goes out back
and she waters her flowers.

446
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,025
-Fuck, I'll just
chloroform the bitch.
-Okay, everything's a go.

447
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,428
Ooh, cocktails.

448
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,896
Ah, fuck it.

449
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,731
I'm just gonna inject
that bitch with acid.

450
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,466
Have that bitch
seeing rainbows.

451
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,967
Jesus, I don't want
to kill her.

452
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,703
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
We're not gonna kill her.

453
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:19,804
We're just gonna put her
to sleep.

454
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,072
And, on that note,

455
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,007
we're gonna set up
and break down.

456
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,942
By the time she wakes up,
everything will be back
to normal.

457
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,711
You get your gig
in cash, bitch.

458
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,879
Gig in motherfuckin' cash.

459
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,881
Will you shut the fuck up?
Seriously.

460
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,917
Come on, dig, bitch.

461
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,753
All right, look, you guys.

462
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,655
We're gonna go out
the same way we came in.

463
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,056
She's the old lady
that's standing out front.

464
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,624
You can't miss her.

465
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,893
Bruce, give me a bump.
For the love of god.

466
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,795
Oh, yeah, you want
some of Mr. moist?

467
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,630
-Just give me some.
-Want my dick?

468
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,998
Shut up,
just give it to me.

469
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,934
Say you want
my dick, bitch.

470
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,869
Say it.

471
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,438
-Say it.
-I want your coke.

472
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,877
Like that shit?

473
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:04,915
All right.

474
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,920
Okay, a deal's a deal,
all right?

475
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,722
And if anything
goes wrong,

476
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,457
I'm gonna cut off
your fucking balls

477
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,658
and I don't owe shit,

478
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,060
you broken record
motherfucker.

479
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,528
Now get the fuck
outta here.

480
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,163
And that goes for you,
too, scooter.

481
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,399
Fucking bitch.

482
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,501
Isn't she saucy?

483
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,006
Ranjit?
Something I can do for you?

484
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:32,009
Hi.

485
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:36,647
Huh, I was just looking
for something.

486
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,182
You know, something.

487
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:40,084
Laundry room's
down the hall, bro.

488
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,752
Yes.

489
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,155
Yes, the laundry room
is down the hallway,

490
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:47,992
but I was admiring
your, uh, uh,

491
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:51,162
unique film antiquities
and glorious memorabilia.

492
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,800
You know, you have
a lot of space here.

493
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,201
You know, you could probably
milk a cow.

494
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,769
It's nice.

495
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,004
Yeah, my old man's
a cinematographer.

496
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,772
I'm lactose intolerant.

497
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,207
But, you know what,
let's cut out this first date

498
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,675
chitchat bullshit.

499
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:05,910
What the fuck
are you doing in here?

500
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:08,479
Okay, pashu.

501
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,115
I'm angry and I'm pissed

502
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,017
and I'm wanting
to hurt that director,

503
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:15,586
and I know you had some things
in your room

504
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,489
and I'm looking for something
to beat him with.

505
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,159
You know what happened
to the last person

506
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,562
that went rummaging around
through my stuff?

507
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,867
Let's just say...

508
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,470
I'm still on medication.

509
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,944
Do you know why
they call me gator, ranjit?

510
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,183
It's because
I'm hard to tame.

511
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:49,620
Please, pashu, no, no.

512
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,127
Oh, man!
Got you!

513
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:58,796
Oh, you should see
your face right now.

514
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,130
I wish you could.

515
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:03,701
It is so stupid-looking.
You look like a hostage.

516
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,236
You look like
you're really mad at me.

517
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:07,071
And you look stupid.

518
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,874
Crazy fucking pashu.

519
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,176
You're awesome, dude.
You're amazing.

520
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:16,180
You're like a fucking
curry dahmer.

521
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,982
- Yes.
- -Quiet on the set!

522
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:20,951
You know what?
I'm sorry. Yep, you got it.

523
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:23,821
Shh, listen.
Don't worry about that guy.

524
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:24,989
- Okay?

525
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:26,957
You proved
your point with him.

526
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,693
I never knew
you had so much heart.

527
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,262
Come in here.
Get over here.

528
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,732
Yes,
booby traps everywhere.

529
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:38,168
There's no treading
in gator's house.

530
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,237
You are
completely unhinged.

531
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,306
You-- you are a sociopath.

532
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:44,542
No, I'm just kidding.
Don't hurt me, please.

533
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,877
Listen, there's a lot of girls
getting dicks slapped

534
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,245
on their foreheads
out there.

535
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,980
I want to see
what I can get on this guy.

536
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,048
Put it
on the Internet later.

537
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,716
Try and make us
some money.

538
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,852
Make yourself at home.
You break it, you buy it.

539
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,187
--Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look at me. Look at me.

540
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,223
I am coming! I am coming!

541
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,192
This is why they call me
the black rhino!

542
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,229
- This is for Botswana!

543
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,632
Cut! God damn it, cut!

544
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,334
That's the fucking
money shot.

545
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:13,137
Holy dick roll.
What the fuck did you eat?

546
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,939
There he is.

547
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,607
Pleasure, I don't give
a hootenanny

548
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,108
what you do
in your own damn room,

549
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,177
but the living room
is community property.

550
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,746
-Hi, ma'am.
-Don't you ma'am me.
I run this house.

551
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,782
So, you better get
your fresh-out-of-film-school

552
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,350
wish-you-had-a-better-job
stuck-in-a-porn

553
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,218
peacock feathers
the hell out of my way.

554
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,254
It's all good.
This is gonna be
a big movie for me.

555
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,656
Yesterday you said you were
doing a photo shoot,

556
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,158
not shooting
a goddamn porn.

557
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,026
I'm writing you up.
I'm telling Harold.

558
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:38,062
-Now, where is he?
-He is the guy.

559
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:41,198
Now, you listen here,
you two-bit crackerjack.

560
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,300
I like nothing more
than some good,

561
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:46,670
old huffin' and puffin',
so I support your industry,

562
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,906
but what
i will not support

563
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:52,776
is your two-inch penis
running around my house

564
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,713
insulting my tenants
with more arrogance

565
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:58,048
than a Kentucky drunk
with a Napoleon complex!

566
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,657
Peanut butter sassafras!
Ah, holy shit!

567
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,859
-What's with the plastic bag?
-I was worried
he was gonna bleed.

568
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,294
Do you have
a handkerchief?

569
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,695
Everybody out.

570
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:12,730
And get this asshole
out of here

571
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,832
before he wakes up.

572
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,967
-Clarelle--
-i don't want to hear it.
I'm writing you up.

573
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,703
All I do is try
to look out for you kids.

574
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,039
And you sure as hell
don't make it easy for me.

575
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,815
--Fuck.

576
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,784
Fuck this.
I'm going back
into construction.

577
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,687
Oh, god.
That smells like donkey piss.

578
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,423
Any time, shit, otherwise,
i wouldn't be able to see you.

579
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,392
Fuck you, cream pie.
Get the fuck out of my face.

580
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:42,726
You wanna fight, midnight?

581
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,962
'Kay, Jesus Christ.

582
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,331
I don't even need zoom
on you girls.

583
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,867
Hello.
I'm gator.

584
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:54,438
Yeah, like a gator.

585
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,973
All right.

586
00:27:55,975 --> 00:28:00,444
He's hot. Grr.

587
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,146
Gators don't go grr.

588
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:05,783
They go rr.

589
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:08,185
Hey.

590
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,023
That was nice,
what you said about how people

591
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,259
treat me and stuff.

592
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:18,729
Thanks
for sticking up for me.

593
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,898
You're like my phula.

594
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
The what?

595
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:26,370
In my culture,
phula means flower.

596
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,372
To me, you are like that.

597
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,808
Oh, come here.

598
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,087
Careful, careful,
careful, careful.

599
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,824
What up, Joe Frazier?

600
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,826
Dude, dope cross.
I didn't even see you coming.

601
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,861
-Thanks, gator.
-Yeah.

602
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,763
-You think
it's broken, clarelle?
-Yeah, it's broken.

603
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,465
Will you put
that damn camera away?

604
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:56,934
No can do, sorry.

605
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,969
We'll wrap it
at the articular disc

606
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,105
and give you a splint.

607
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,506
You'll be fine, okay?

608
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,209
Gator, grab a bag
of frozen veggies

609
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:06,410
and wrap it in a towel.

610
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,911
Yes, ma'am.

611
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:11,448
I'll go outside,
make sure bozo leaves.

612
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,850
Hurry.

613
00:29:12,852 --> 00:29:13,984
Carrie, you gotta see this.

614
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,519
Check this out.

615
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,187
-Fuckin' hard, man.
-I totally missed the punch,

616
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,288
but I totally got the fall.

617
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,158
Ready?
Three, two, boom.

618
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,761
I don't fucking care.
You're so annoying.

619
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,062
"You're so annoying."

620
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,333
Move.

621
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,202
Tell your little cronies

622
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,905
that the flowers
are around back.

623
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,843
Thank you.

624
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:42,446
That's a down payment,
pussy cat.

625
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,047
Okay, ew.

626
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,150
Get the fuck off me
and leave.

627
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:50,120
Let's go.

628
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,356
We'll see.

629
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,833
Fuckers.

630
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,170
My room, now.

631
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,939
Look, I don't know
what you have planned,

632
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,507
and, frankly,
i don't care.

633
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,075
Odds are, clarelle's
not siding with you,

634
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,844
and scooter is bad news.

635
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,180
Coming from me,
that's a pretty big deal.

636
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,548
If you want this thing
to go off,

637
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,483
you need my help
and I want half.

638
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,318
Fuck you, gator.

639
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,220
All right, remember
your little weed
growing operation

640
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,221
you had in here?

641
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:25,222
Payback, fucker.

642
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:26,390
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

643
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,591
Okay, well,
go ahead and call

644
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:28,926
your little boy toy
and tell him

645
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,060
that his party's off.

646
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,163
-Clarelle!
-All right, look.

647
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,398
I'll give you a third.

648
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,966
Half.

649
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,534
You know, you may think
your fucking hot shit

650
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,403
around here 'cause
you're the little handyman

651
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,238
and clarelle's favorite
and everything,

652
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,140
but don't fuckin' forget
that outside of this house,

653
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,075
you ain't fuckin' shit,
you weird little fuck.

654
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,343
Oh, pfft.

655
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,578
I am the coolest dude
in this house

656
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,146
-and you know that.
-Okay.

657
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,315
But do not piss me off,
little miss thing.

658
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:52,616
Because it'll be
a bad payday.

659
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,184
And I know that the face

660
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,986
and all this is how you
make your money,

661
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:58,155
so I'd hate to fuck
that up, too.

662
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,289
Are you threatening me?

663
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,892
Call it what you like,
darling.

664
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:03,093
Half.

665
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:06,063
Sugar pie, honey bunch.

666
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,397
You know, fuck you, gator.
Fuck you.

667
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,599
All right?

668
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,067
I have been
in this fucking town

669
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,301
for four fucking years

670
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,303
doing some really
degrading shit,

671
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,005
taking some really
fucked up jobs

672
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,407
just to get anywhere,
all right?

673
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,443
Now, I finally feel
like I have a shot.

674
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:21,178
This deal could get me
on a hot runway

675
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,646
that I need to be on.

676
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:25,182
Get the exposure
that I finally need, you know?

677
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:29,887
I just--
i can't go back.

678
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,591
I can't go back
to the fuckin' fields

679
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:37,895
and the trailer parks
and the beer drinking rednecks

680
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,997
who just fuck me for fun

681
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:43,600
so that they can
go and tell their friends.

682
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,137
I won't do it, all right?
I need this.

683
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,006
I can't handle
this fuckin' town

684
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,574
and the fucking rejection
any longer.

685
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,043
I just need to feel like
I'm doing something,

686
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,479
like I'm worth something,
you know?

687
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:01,018
I can't fucking fail now,
all right?

688
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,653
Ew, are you crying?

689
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,222
Yeah, fuck you, dude.

690
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,657
I'm having
a fucking breakdown here.

691
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,026
I need
your fucking help, okay?

692
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,670
What about clarelle?

693
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,407
Scooter said he was
gonna take care of it.

694
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,276
It'll be fine.

695
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,512
And you believe that?

696
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,552
This is fucked up.

697
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,259
I've, uh...

698
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:46,330
Been here, well,
about ten years now.

699
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,398
Don't let
too many people in here.

700
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,701
Mm, thanks for the invite.

701
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,671
Is that you onstage?

702
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,373
Oh, yeah.

703
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,477
Wow, you look amazing.

704
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,547
Oh, that was
the good old days.

705
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,549
Ran in the circles
with the greats

706
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,251
from the glory days
of off Broadway.

707
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,355
Years I spent in New York
doing understudy work

708
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:15,225
and walk-ons from everything
from brecht to Chekhov.

709
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:19,196
-Chekhov?
-Mm-hmm.

710
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:22,265
I played trofimov
in my third year.

711
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:26,636
Oh, you were an idealist.

712
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,373
-I played Anya in '74.
-I was.

713
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:31,308
The critics loved me.

714
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,078
It was gonna be
my break to Broadway.

715
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,147
So, what happened?

716
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,116
What happens
to so many starlets

717
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:42,486
and wild-hearted artists.

718
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:45,689
We fall in love.
I got pregnant.

719
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,658
Had a miscarriage.

720
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,194
After the miscarriage,

721
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,563
the only thing
that healed him was booze,

722
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,265
and when
he found the bottle,

723
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:59,269
the thing that healed me
were ice packs and bandages.

724
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:00,337
I'm really sorry.

725
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:03,173
Oh, I was
a wild one, too.

726
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:06,810
In this biz,
it's hard to step out

727
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:08,478
once you're already in.

728
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,680
Men have all the power,
right or wrong,

729
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:14,217
and women...

730
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,585
They're easily forgotten.

731
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:21,525
So, I got up and moved
to L.A. in '77.

732
00:34:22,693 --> 00:34:24,494
Weren't you afraid?

733
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,496
Sure, I was.

734
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,298
But I was more afraid
of not making it,

735
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,302
of never winning
that statue.

736
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,840
More afraid
of failing myself.

737
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:39,776
What are you afraid of?

738
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,711
Struggle.

739
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,385
Whether or not I...

740
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:52,489
Think I could be
good enough.

741
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,591
I guess I'm also afraid
of whether I can get over

742
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,493
my own issues...

743
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,464
And actually do it.

744
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,300
Yeah, I...

745
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:07,204
I am afraid.

746
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:10,440
The fact
that you know that...

747
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,276
Puts you ahead
of the game.

748
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,379
You know, I may never
have gotten my obie

749
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:21,685
or my Tony or my Oscar.

750
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:27,290
But I was in it
and I found glory.

751
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,861
And nobody can take that
away from me.

752
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,632
Well, that's enough
of that crap.

753
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,368
I've got to go and tend
to my flowers.

754
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,739
By the way...

755
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,609
Take this.

756
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:49,513
I have no use
for it anymore.

757
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:52,315
-What is it?
-Sand.

758
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,750
From the backstage bags

759
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,685
of my first leading role
off-Broadway.

760
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,388
And don't go putting
that sterilizer all over it.

761
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,757
That's
your first assignment.

762
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,562
Not--

763
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,464
not all,

764
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:10,667
but some grit is good.

765
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,469
Yes, ma'am.

766
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,337
Now get outta here.

767
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,907
Go on.

768
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:25,182
-I really can't--
-I'm an old lady and I can't
take too many visitors.

769
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,888
Thanks...

770
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,456
Get.

771
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,591
...for everything.

772
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,540
What happened, Paul?

773
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,315
Clarelle,
there you are.

774
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:01,551
Jeez, you are about as hard
to get conference with
as the pope.

775
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,353
Listen, got a lot of things
going on this month,

776
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:04,955
which, by the way,
I'm gonna be a little late

777
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:06,923
-on rent again.
-Gator, I don't want
to hear it.

778
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,326
I've had your back
for the past three months,

779
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,894
and you know Harold's
a Jew.

780
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,263
So, there's only
so far I can go.

781
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,898
And don't forget,
i only run this shack.

782
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,866
Clarelle, wait a minute.

783
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,368
I've been keeping up
on plumbing,

784
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,736
I've been keeping up
on drywall.

785
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,738
I have a whole list
of things that I need

786
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,240
to get this place tip-top.

787
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,708
Gator, kiss my patootie.

788
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,843
The walls need fillin',
the toilets are busted.

789
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,546
Your only job here
is to fix this damn house,

790
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,880
and that pays your rent.

791
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,616
Nobody even uses
those toilets anyway.

792
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,284
They're all filled up
with poo.

793
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,253
Well, maybe somebody'd
take a shit in there

794
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,787
if they were white
and working.

795
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:41,992
I know I told your mother
I'd take care of you.

796
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,694
That's what godmothers
are for.

797
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,730
Your mother's
like a sister to me.

798
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:50,367
I'd do anything
for her and you.

799
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,402
But I can't keep
this umbilical cord

800
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,703
attached forever,

801
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,573
so tomorrow I need $800
out of you

802
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:59,276
or I'm serving you
eviction papers.

803
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:01,044
Clarelle,
how can you expect--

804
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,779
do you think
Janet and Gary

805
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,882
would be proud
of what their son's become?

806
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,018
It's time for you
to man up.

807
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:15,292
It breaks my heart.

808
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:19,696
I love you like a son.

809
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:23,833
When you-- when you
were a teenager...

810
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,638
I always thought
you'd be great.

811
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,944
Well, there's still time
for that.

812
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,080
Now, not another word.

813
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:39,716
I've got to go
and tend to my flowers.

814
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:46,082
Who is it?

815
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,751
Hey, ren-ren.

816
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,753
Oh.

817
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:52,088
Hello.
Please come in.

818
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,926
Wow.

819
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:00,964
Your room smells...

820
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:03,133
Really good in here.

821
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,402
It's very tech-y
and stuff.

822
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,537
So, how can I help you,
Carrie?

823
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,539
I have a favor
to ask of you.

824
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,074
So, I'm throwing
a party later.

825
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,575
Oh, I really like parties.

826
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,643
You know,
my father in India,

827
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,412
he's a really good dancer.

828
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:17,514
He does
this bhangra dance thing.
He's a--

829
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,516
yeah, okay, ranjit,
we all have a dad.

830
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:20,617
Jesus.

831
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,585
Anyway,
what I need you to do

832
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,621
for the party,
don't tell anybody

833
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,556
and please
don't do anything stupid

834
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:28,124
when my friends are here.

835
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:31,828
And also don't tell clarelle.
Can you do that for me?

836
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,097
What do I get in return?

837
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:38,101
I thought maybe
we could work out a deal, hmm?

838
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,103
Oh, yes.

839
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,605
I'm really liking this.

840
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,607
-Oh, god.
-Yeah?

841
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,576
Creamy and American
and white.

842
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,578
Mm.

843
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,914
Okay, so,
we have a deal, then?

844
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,216
Maybe later
we'll have a little fun? Hmm?

845
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:56,019
What kind of fun,
my wild snow leopard?

846
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,690
Fun
that you will never forget.

847
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,026
-Oh. Mm.
-Oh, my god.

848
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:05,495
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

849
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,864
You have to wait.
Till later.

850
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:11,201
Hmm, what's wrong,
kitty cat?

851
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:14,103
Nothing.
We just, um--

852
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,172
I just want it
to be really special

853
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:19,576
for you, ran-ran,
okay, hmm?

854
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:22,579
So, I'm going
to be wanting you

855
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,013
and your two girlfriends.

856
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,617
What?

857
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:31,187
Okay, if not,
no party.

858
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,523
I'll tell clarelle.

859
00:41:33,525 --> 00:41:36,493
Okay, fine.
That's fine.

860
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:39,229
Mm, good.

861
00:41:39,231 --> 00:41:41,865
I'm going to need you
to text me two photographs

862
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,500
of your friends,

863
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,068
and we meet here tonight.

864
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,703
Oh, yeah, one more thing.

865
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:49,839
I'm going to need
a deposit.

866
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,674
I don't have
any fucking money.

867
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,010
Hmm.

868
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,646
That's a down payment,
pussy cat.

869
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:59,282
Okay, ew, get the fuck
off me and leave.

870
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,117
Where did you get that?

871
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,187
Hmm, my resources
are none of your concern.

872
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,890
But I encourage you
to please keep listening.

873
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:10,159
I'll fucking give you half.
Fuck you, all right?

874
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,594
I have been
in this fuckin' town

875
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,062
for four fucking years...

876
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:15,865
-How do you even--
-...The most degrading shit...

877
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,634
Who the fuck are you?

878
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:20,303
-Seriously?
-Shh.

879
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:23,039
Snow bunny, hmm?

880
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,009
A couple of hundred
and we meet here tonight.

881
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:29,078
-You motherfuck--
-please hand over a deposit.

882
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,748
And it will be
100% refundable once we...

883
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,554
Can't
fucking believe this.

884
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:38,955
Stop.

885
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:46,095
You're so creamy.

886
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,599
I'm sure you're filled
with juicy goodness.

887
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:53,269
Oh, if I licked you
from the outside in,

888
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,071
I'm sure you would taste

889
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,742
like j-e-l-l-o.

890
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,844
Okay, gross.
Come on.

891
00:43:01,846 --> 00:43:03,880
Oh, yes.
I like it.

892
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,950
I've been a naughty schoolboy.
Spank me.

893
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:12,021
Oh, my god.
You are a fucking pervert.

894
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,057
You are truly disgusting.

895
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:19,128
Where do you think
you're going, bitch?

896
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,064
Excuse me, aunt jemima.

897
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:23,132
Aunt jemima.
That's cute.

898
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,101
-You like that?
-Was this before or after

899
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,369
she took off the rag?

900
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:27,704
I don't know, bitch.
You got a weave.

901
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:30,607
- Don't touch me.

902
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,775
Well, now that I know
what you up to,

903
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,611
that little cute
designer purse

904
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,612
is mine.

905
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,114
-Oh, this one?
-Yeah.

906
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:41,217
-Fuck you, bitch.
-Who you callin' a bitch,
bitch?

907
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,819
Phula.

908
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:44,387
Yeah, you better have my back,
motherfucker.

909
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,888
Now, listen to me, bitch.

910
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,256
Hold that bitch.

911
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:49,025
This little
fucking designer purse,

912
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,394
like I said, and everything
in it is mine, all right?

913
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,162
And if you want
your little fiesta

914
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,664
to go off
without a hitch,

915
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:57,166
these are
my motherfuckin' terms.

916
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,402
Now tap out, bitch,
and let me know you good.

917
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,238
Squeeze her.

918
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,773
Tap out, bitch!

919
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,642
Fuck you.

920
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,710
Hey, let her go.
She's dying.

921
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:10,113
Oh, no, I been choked
by a lot of niggas
with big dicks.

922
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:12,215
Trust me, I know
what a bitch can take.

923
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:14,350
Tap out, bitch.

924
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,987
Give me the fucking purse.

925
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,288
-Oh.
-You good?

926
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,723
See you later.

927
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,940
Ah, do you know
there are 612 seconds

928
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,208
in exactly 10.2 minutes

929
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,011
and I have been out here
for 645, 646.

930
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:51,948
Do you have any idea
what that kind of heat
does to the immune system?

931
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,183
My mom just died.

932
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,252
Oh, fuck.

933
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,421
Yeah, she was
my best friend.

934
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:02,158
Look, I'm sorry
if I came on too strong, okay?

935
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,826
I can totally relate.

936
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:06,295
My mom passed away
right after I finished school.

937
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,998
Right after the funeral,
i had to get the hell out
of New York.

938
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,399
I feel completely lost,
i mean, fuck, Carrie,

939
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:11,868
I don't even have
a fucking agent.

940
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,002
Well, maybe today's
your lucky day.

941
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:14,337
I really need
to get myself

942
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:16,038
out of this headspace
that I'm in,

943
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,473
so I thought I'd throw
a party here tonight.

944
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,142
And, you know,
there's gonna be some really

945
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:20,810
-important people there.
-And I'm sure clarelle

946
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,912
is just happy about that.

947
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,347
Yeah, she's gonna go out
for the night.

948
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:26,349
Look, clarelle and i
are really tight, okay?

949
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:27,817
Tighter than you two are,

950
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:29,786
so, you know,
she totally trusts me.

951
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,921
If you don't go
and be a whiny little bitch

952
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,956
and cry to clarelle
about the party,

953
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,892
maybe I'll introduce you
to Vinnie tonight.

954
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:37,426
-He's an agent.
-Don't touch me.

955
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:38,895
'Cause god only knows
what kind of mold

956
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,329
and parasites
live between your legs

957
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:42,131
-and all over your body.
-Just shut up, all right?

958
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,333
This is gonna open up
some really big doors
for you.

959
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,435
Look, Vinnie is a huge agent,
all right?

960
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,137
And, besides,
Hollywood is always looking

961
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,106
for their next up-and-coming
colored talent.

962
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,942
"Colored," really?
That's so bigot of you.

963
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,243
-Fuck off.
-Oh, come on.

964
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,179
This is gonna be
a big deal for you.

965
00:46:56,181 --> 00:46:58,815
Yeah? And why the fuck
should I believe you?

966
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:01,117
-Why would I lie to you?
-Because you're
a fucking manipulating,

967
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,351
conniving little bitch.

968
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,153
What are you
so afraid of, hmm?

969
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,421
Making a deal with the devil,
that's who.

970
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,156
Pinky swear?

971
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,591
I wouldn't trust
that pinkie if it was mine.

972
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,459
Fool me once,
but it won't happen again.

973
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:11,828
And the only way
i get out of this house

974
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,262
is by booking jobs.

975
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,031
So, if your buddy shows up
and everything goes

976
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:17,099
exactly the way
you tell me it will,

977
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:18,968
I will owe you for life.

978
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,938
But if anything
goes south,

979
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,472
don't ever look
in my fucking direction

980
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:24,907
ever again.

981
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:26,909
Deal.

982
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,145
Now leave.

983
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,383
-Bye.
-Cunt.

984
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,419
Thank you.

985
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,384
Oh.

986
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,054
Oh, oh, yes.

987
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,260
Oh.

988
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:21,998
Oh.

989
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,033
Oh, thank you.

990
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,416
Hey.

991
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:43,252
Hey, I gotta pee.

992
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,289
I just want to talk to you
in private, okay?

993
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,423
Now, tell me.

994
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,125
What the fuck
were you doing

995
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,193
making business deals
with that bitch Carrie, huh?

996
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,129
You trying to make
mommy jealous?

997
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,365
-Here, take a shot.
-No, I prefer not to.

998
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,034
Shut up.
Just take it. Open up.

999
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,371
Burns, right?

1000
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:04,707
Feels good, right?
Hmm?

1001
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,509
-Listen.
-What?

1002
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,511
Listen.

1003
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:11,480
I-- I want to know
why you cry.

1004
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:12,615
Oh, that's not important
right now.

1005
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,350
No, no, no.

1006
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,218
Because people don't cry
when they...

1007
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:20,022
Oh, I get it.

1008
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,724
You want to get personal.

1009
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:23,392
I'll show you
fucking personal.

1010
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,065
How's this
for personal, huh?

1011
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,133
-That personal enough?
-People will see.

1012
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,401
I don't give a fuck
who sees.

1013
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:33,602
Look at me.
Look at me, ranjit.

1014
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,104
-Look at me.
-Okay, okay.

1015
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:36,439
Look at me, okay?
Focus.

1016
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,140
Okay.

1017
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,176
--Yeah, right?

1018
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:43,446
Oh, you want this thick
caramel pussy, huh?

1019
00:49:43,448 --> 00:49:44,981
-Yeah.
-Huh?

1020
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,315
-I--

1021
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:47,583
-I want it.
-You do?

1022
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:49,118
I want the caramel
and the thickness

1023
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,287
-in the pussy.
-Oh, yeah.

1024
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:54,323
-I want it.
-You're gonna give me
this curry stick, huh?

1025
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,325
Hmm?

1026
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,662
Ooh, you're getting hard.
I like that.

1027
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,497
I'm going to give it
to you.

1028
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,466
You're gonna give it to me?
Tell me how. Tell me how.

1029
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,534
Give it to you like
I'm gonna put it inside you.

1030
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,169
Then what you gonna do?
Tell me.

1031
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,205
You gonna fuck me
the way the niggas do, huh?

1032
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,506
-Yeah.
-Hmm?

1033
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,075

1038
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,352
-Donkey.
-Ooh, a donkey.

1039
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,621
Mm, I want to see
that fucking donkey.

1040
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,526
Yes!

1041
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:36,298
Okay.
Ah, okay, nice.

1042
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,601
Ooh, frisky.

1043
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,469
Let's go on the bed.

1044
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,038
-The bed.
-Okay, okay.

1045
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,572
The bed. Okay.
No, the bed.

1046
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:49,278
Enter now,
my world of mysticism.

1047
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,714
Do you want your pussy

1048
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,783
to be scratched
like a tiger?

1049
00:50:53,785 --> 00:50:55,384
Shh.

1050
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,220
Oh.
Oh, my dreams.

1051
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:02,491
Ass to be ripped
by a big black cock?

1052
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:04,760
Bite it.
Bite it, my phula.

1053
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:07,229
Have you ever fucked
your mother?

1054
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:11,300
--Yeah, nigga, that's what
I'm talking about.

1055
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,269
Have you ever
fucked her in the ass

1056
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:16,405
and make her eat her own shit
by blowing your fucking cock?

1057
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,707
--Whoo.

1058
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,643
Okay, that's new.

1059
00:51:20,645 --> 00:51:23,579
Whoo, frisky.

1060
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,281
Just put it in,
motherfucker.

1061
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:27,683
Do you want
to suck my cock?

1062
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:30,119
-Yes.
-Okay, okay.

1063
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,521
We're gonna put it in.
No, no.

1064
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:34,290
Motherfucker,
put it in.

1065
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,558
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1066
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,094
-Yes!
-Yes! Yes!

1067
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,562
-Yes!
-Yes!

1068
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:41,697
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

1069
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,799
-What?
-I'm ready to shoot!

1070
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,246
I know you ain't just pumped
three times

1071
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,714
and skeet, motherfucker.

1072
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,517
Paradise, my love.

1073
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:03,152
You gonna finally
get me up here

1074
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,653
and you gonna pump twice
and skeet inside of me

1075
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,655
-and not let me know?
-Three times, my love.

1076
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,190
I ain't your love,
motehrfucker.

1077
00:52:08,192 --> 00:52:09,492
I even called you "nigga."

1078
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:12,761
You ain't no nigga.
Niggas can fuck.

1079
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:15,197
-But...
-There's a party downstairs,

1080
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:16,632
and you know what
I'm gonna do?

1081
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,701
I'm gonna go find me
a nigga that can fuck.

1082
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:20,636
Fuckin' faster
than a computer.

1083
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,905
I gotta go spend money
on a morning after pill.

1084
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,508
Forty fucking dollars
that you gonna pay for.

1085
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,910
-But I...
-But what, squirt gun?

1086
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,779
But I love you.

1087
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:33,749
Oh, hell, no.

1088
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,284
-Gator?
-Yes, sir.

1089
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:37,219
-Get me some fuckin' blow.
-Yes, sir.

1090
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:39,321
-Make sure you get
at least an 8 ball.
-Okay.

1091
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,924
And keep your fucking change
like you usually do.

1092
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:43,726
Don't so fucking--

1093
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:45,194
damn it, ranjit,

1094
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:48,164
why you gotta make me
feel this way?

1095
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,633
This is my life.
This is what I do.

1096
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,169
This is who I am,
but I didn't ask
for this shit.

1097
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,473
And I'm a fucking ho.

1098
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,543
I fuck for money.

1099
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,946
It's really fucking hard
for me

1100
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:06,916
to see what's real
and what's fake.

1101
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,320
You don't know me, ranjit.

1102
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:12,955
But I want to know.

1103
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:15,891
You want to know
that my mom was a meth head?

1104
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:20,362
And my dad used to have
his friends come over

1105
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,664
when my mom
was in the streets

1106
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,632
to have his friends
fuck me?

1107
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,836
And I was taken away
by child services, okay?

1108
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,506
And raised
in a fucking white family.

1109
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:31,607
Fucking white school

1110
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:35,311
where everybody
made fun of me.

1111
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:38,380
Called me a nigga,
a spook.

1112
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:42,918
And sometimes I wish
the voices in my head
would just stop

1113
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,256
and I feel
like a fucking fake.

1114
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,857
What else do you
want to know?

1115
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,593
My phula.

1116
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:54,597
No, no, no, don't.
Don't feel bad for me.

1117
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,499
This is my life.

1118
00:53:57,501 --> 00:54:00,769
This is what I chose,
so this is what I do.

1119
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,673
And if
there's anything genuine

1120
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:05,975
about what
you're saying to me,

1121
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:09,812
then I have
to let you know.

1122
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:11,614
'Cause I'm not the one.

1123
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,586
No.

1124
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,757
I can't love you, ranjit.

1125
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,827
I'm too busy trying
to fucking love myself.

1126
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:42,778
Boom!
What's up now, slut?

1127
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,046
-Fucking bitch.
-Yeah, bitch.

1128
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:46,282
Who fucks you now,
you fucking whore?

1129
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,284
That's for taking
my fucking purse,
you dirty little cunt.

1130
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:50,853
--Yeah, fuck you,
you dirty house nigger.

1131
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,467
-Hello, no ring. Thank--
-gator!

1132
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,437
Oh, Tyrell.
Fucking rad party, bro.

1133
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:09,805
Yeah. Hey,
did anybody ever tell you

1134
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,006
you look like
Abraham Lincoln

1135
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:12,975
with some serious bdsm
going on?

1136
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,678
-That's really interesting.
-Dude, that is
the nicest thing

1137
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,012
anyone
has ever said to me.

1138
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,781
Thank you.
Have you seen Carrie?

1139
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,416
I need to find her
right now.

1140
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:21,650
-I did.
-Yes?

1141
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,018
I did.
I saw her in the main room.

1142
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,753
Great.
I will see you later.

1143
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:26,355
Wait a second.
Are you okay?

1144
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,457
You know, you are
really sweating profusely.

1145
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:29,825
You should consider
the hospital.

1146
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,994
Not a chance
you're getting me to leave

1147
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:33,962
this place right here,
right now.

1148
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,464
But what I do need

1149
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,866
is for you to loosen up
the cheeks, okay?

1150
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,902
So, let's get these guys hard,
we'll get this loose.

1151
00:55:39,904 --> 00:55:41,503
Meet me over here.

1152
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,505
I'm gonna mix you up
a little cocktail

1153
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,442
out of my two favorite colors,
pink and blue.

1154
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:48,444
-We put 'em in a...
-I'm not doing that, gator.

1155
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:50,045
It's kind of against
my upbringing.

1156
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,513
...put it in our nose.

1157
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:54,083
And then we go blast off.
Pew, pew.

1158
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:55,451
Okay, gator, look,
you should really

1159
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:56,752
not consider mixing--

1160
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:58,120
it's probably
really bad for you.

1161
00:55:58,122 --> 00:55:59,788
Maybe talk to the food
and drug administration.

1162
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,056
Okay, you know what?
Here we go.

1163
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:02,791
Let's reverse
just a little bit,

1164
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:04,093
right back to where
i told you

1165
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,561
never to tell me
how to live my life again.

1166
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:06,862
That includes my drug use.

1167
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,797
Number two,
mixing things

1168
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:09,932
is what brought you
into existence,

1169
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:11,033
so let's not hate on it.

1170
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,501
And, number three,

1171
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:14,403
a little bit of e,
a little bit of v,

1172
00:56:14,405 --> 00:56:16,705
and you're gonna be solid,
dude.

1173
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:17,740
Solid like a rock.

1174
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,144
-Oh, my god.
-Wow.

1175
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:23,946
Oh, my god,
that was amazing.

1176
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:26,615
Brain boner, man.
Whoa.

1177
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:28,784
Hey, hey, hey.
You got any ass plugs?

1178
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:30,919
Okay, and from the coolest
to the weirdest.

1179
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:32,888
I'm gonna go ahead
and get right on outta here.

1180
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,423
You're weird.

1181
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:35,991
No, no offense!

1182
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,994
D batteries?
Greasy door?

1183
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:40,662
Zucchini?

1184
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:41,797
Fuck!

1185
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,644
Oh, yes.
That feels good.

1186
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:58,547
You should know better.

1187
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:02,618
- You belong over there.

1188
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,572
You don't even know
what love is.

1189
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:25,641
Couldn't even hold it!

1190
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,509
Like a child!

1191
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:34,149
Why did you go away?

1192
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,024
Don't fucking push me.

1193
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,727
Ah, fuck!
This year.

1194
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:47,763
This is my fucking year,
motherfucker.

1195
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:49,198
I swear to you.
Okay, seriously?

1196
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,700
I'm gonna be
on a fuckin' runway,

1197
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:54,503
and by the time--
by this time next year,

1198
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:57,773
I'm gonna be in fucking Milan,
motherfucker.

1199
00:57:57,775 --> 00:57:59,875
-Shut the fuck up.
-Fuck you, okay?

1200
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:03,512
I didn't move
to this goddamn town
to fucking fail, all right?

1201
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:04,947
Shut up.

1202
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:06,782
Mm,
that's fucking good.

1203
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,884
Mm.

1204
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:11,186
My motherfucking passport
is gonna be stamped!

1205
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,523
And everybody
in this goddamn town

1206
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:15,924
is gonna know
who I fucking am,

1207
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:17,626
and if anybody has
a fucking problem with it,

1208
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:19,495
well, they can suck
my fucking dick.

1209
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:20,629
Why don't I put my dick
in your mouth,

1210
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:21,697
you fucking bitch? Huh?

1211
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:23,131
-Yeah, my dick.
-My dick, bitch.

1212
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,133
No, my dick, motherfuck.
Get the fuck off.

1213
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:28,136
- Fuck you.

1214
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:30,572
I got a lump.
Do you got anything to drink?

1215
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,074
Yeah, I got that good shit
for you, bitch.

1216
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,675
Give it to me.

1217
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,277
Give it to me.
Fuckin'-- you're gross.

1218
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:37,679
Seriously, fuck off.

1219
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,114
Drink that shit, bitch.

1220
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:41,683
What is that salty shit?

1221
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,886
-What the fuck?
-That's that Mr. moist, baby.

1222
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,154
-What?
-It's that g, bitch.

1223
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:48,657
That's fucking g?
What the fuck is wrong with--

1224
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:50,259

1225
00:58:50,261 --> 00:58:51,693
What's wrong with you?

1226
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,061
Why would you
fucking give that to me?

1227
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:56,131
Get the fuck away from me,
seriously.

1228
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,201
-Get away from me.
Get away from me.
-What's the matter, bitch?

1229
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,869
--No.

1230
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,272
Get the fuck off me.

1231
00:59:03,274 --> 00:59:07,009
Ah, feel that.
Feel that shit.

1232
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:08,710
Yeah, feel that shit.

1233
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,045
Get the fuck off me.

1234
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,176
Jiminy cricket,
you are enormous.

1235
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:43,645
-Whew.
-Where do you think
you're going?

1236
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:45,881
Just directly behind you
to get back to my room.

1237
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:49,151
-You need a stamp.
-I live there,
my room's there.

1238
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,352
I take a poop
behind the tree

1239
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:51,753
over there
every single morning.

1240
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,221
How many rooms
are back there?

1241
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,824
Four, with a door

1242
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,193
that leads
to a secret garden.

1243
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:00,829
All right, but don't let me
find out you lied to me.

1244
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:02,297
-See this hand?
-Yeah.

1245
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,066
Thirty pounds of pressure.

1246
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,801
Together with this hand?

1247
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:08,704
Forty pounds of pressure
per square inch.

1248
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:10,639
Crush your head
like a grape.

1249
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:11,940
Now move it along.

1250
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,209
Pumpkins.
Peacocks.

1251
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:55,117
You're gonna find
a nigger to fuck?

1252
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,686
Huh? You're gonna find
a nigger to fuck?

1253
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:01,189
Yeah.

1254
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:04,259
I'm gonna find somebody
to fuck, too.

1255
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,795
Wait, whoa, whoa.
You're Tyrell.

1256
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,430
-Yeah.
-How long you been here?
Fucking a!

1257
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:10,365
We're supposed to get together
and hang out tonight.

1258
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,034
I didn't think-- she actually
talked about that?

1259
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:13,368
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1260
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,369
-Julliard, right?
-Yes!

1261
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:15,437
Oh, fuckin' a!

1262
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:16,872
Dude, this calls

1263
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:18,874
for a fucking
celebratory experience.

1264
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,842
Let's do
a fucking elephant tusk.

1265
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:22,110
Whoo!

1266
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,079
Okay, I don't know
what that is,

1267
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:26,314
-but it sounds
like a lot of fun.
-Fuckin' a, man.

1268
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,283
I'm so happy you're here.
I got so much to tell you.

1269
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:30,252
I'm so fucking excited
to work with you, baby.

1270
01:01:30,254 --> 01:01:33,155
-Wow.
-Talented actor,
good-looking fuckin' guy.

1271
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:35,190
We're gonna make so much
fuckin' money in this town.

1272
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,092
-Oh, oh, okay.
-I'm gonna make you
a fuckin' star.

1273
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:39,728
Yeah, that's--
that's not my cup of tea.

1274
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,329
Vinnie, Vinnie.
Whoa, that's a lot.

1275
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,131
-That's a lot.
That looks like Alaska.
-T, baby,

1276
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,700
how the fuck are we supposed
to work together

1277
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,334
if we don't do
the same shit?

1278
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:48,437
Here's your chance to be
a motherfuckin' star, man.

1279
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:51,073
We are at the top
of the agency chain.

1280
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:52,974

with number two. Yeah!

1282
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:56,311
-That's good.
-I tell you what, man.

1283
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:57,746
Next week, we'll get lunch

1284
01:01:57,748 --> 01:01:59,414

1285
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,117
Here's my business card.
I'mma make you a fucking star.

1286
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:03,351
Know what? You're right.
This is good.

1287
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:05,087
This is good.
This is supposed to be.

1288
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:06,955
Get in here.
Let's seal the deal.

1289
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:08,056
Let's sign

01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,725
Only live once, right?

1291
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:11,193
Go ahead, right into
one nostril, plug the other.

1292
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,961
Come on, fucker, man up.

Yeah, yeah!
Inhale that shit.

01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:19,434
Burn your fuckin' insides.
Melt your fuckin' brain.

1296
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:23,939
Give me
a fuckin' hit of that.

1297
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:27,109
-It burns!
-Good, it's supposed to.

1298
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:30,846
Whoo!

Fuckin' enjoy it.

1300
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:33,982
I feel like I have
concrete in my throat.

1301
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:35,484
Yeah, that's the trip,

Oh, god,

a wet nightmare?

1326
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,494

-I love nitrous.
-Hello, ladies.

You are so pretty.

01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,350
-Please god, tell me.
-No.

1352
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:23,919
But you could
if you want to.

1353
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,287
Oh, my god,

1354
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,589
a better answer
than just yes.

1355
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:30,325
Tell me what I need to do.
I will do anything, girls.

1356
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:31,660
Anything.

1357
01:05:31,662 --> 01:05:34,496
Fresh out the tank.

1358
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:43,004

I'm just gonna say this

1364
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,292
Tell me into the camera
that you never saw me.

1365
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,963
-We never saw you.
-Oh, very good. Okay.

1366
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:09,631
End record.
Listen, girls.

1367
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:12,033
Here's the deal.
We're off the record.

1368
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:14,035
-I'm coming right back here.
-Where are you going?

1369
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:17,105
I just-- I have to find
this stupid fucking person.

1370
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:18,707
Listen, just
don't go anywhere, okay?

1371
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:20,208
Or I will find you.

1372
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:21,977
If you stay,

1373
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:25,580
you can take all of the Molly
in that entire case.

1374
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:26,681

01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:42,497
-Well, i--

1382
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,766
Okay, you two are...

1383
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:47,369
Let me know when you're ready
to graduate.

1384
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:48,536
Mm, I'm good where I am.

1385
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,389
Oh, you want a shot?

1386
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,762
What is she doing?

1387
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:16,064
- I want what she's on.
- -I'll take two.

1388
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:18,633
Right? Right?

1389
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,212
Oh, shit.

1390
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:36,051
No, no, no, no, shh.

1391
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:38,119
Shh.

1392
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:46,327
Okay.

1393
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:51,533
What the fuck did you do?

1394
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:52,734
Fuck, fuck.

1395
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:06,514
Oh.

1396
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:08,750
- Oh, my god.

1397
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,722
O-m-g.

1398
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,668
Carrie.
Whoa, what are you on?

1399
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,437
Okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1400
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,605
Yeah, yeah, monkeys.

1401
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,508
So much cocaÃ­na.

1402
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:36,111
- Yeah, fuck her.
-You guys are doing--

1403
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,378
fuckin' fuck that bitch.

1404
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,713
Carrie?

1405
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:40,548
Yo, Carrie, wake up!

1406
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,883
What the fuck are you doing,
motherfucker?

1407
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,351
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

1408
01:08:43,353 --> 01:08:45,120
Get off my fuckin' roommate,
bro!

1409
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,688
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Carrie, wake up!

1410
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:48,423
-Get the fuck out!
-Carrie, wake up!

1411
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:52,193
Get off my roommate.
Get-- get of me, man.

1412
01:08:52,195 --> 01:08:53,428
What the fuck are you guys
doing in here?

1413
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,762
No!

1414
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,131
Carrie!

1415
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,665
Carrie, wake up!

1416
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,734
Fucker, you scumbags!

1417
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:02,237
I got you on tape,
motherfuckers!

1418
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,638
Come out here
and fight me like a man,

1419
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,407
you fuckin' coward!

1420
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:08,309
You wanna fight, huh?

1421
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,878
-You wanna fight?
-Yeah.

1422
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,580
--Damn straight!

1423
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:16,184
Oh, god.
Come on, let's go.

1424
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:18,520
Ah, damn it.

1425
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,157
Clarelle?

1426
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,526
-What the fuck?
-Clarelle?

1427
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:28,696
-What's wrong? Are you--
-oh, please, I'll sign
an autograph later.

1428
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:32,167
What are you talking about?
And what is with the nail
and the dirt?

1429
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:35,870
I'm sure we'll see
each other later.
Bye-bye, darling.

1430
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,373
-Clarelle.
-Bye-bye.

1431
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,879
What the fuck?

1432
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,455
Stay down, bitch!

1433
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,927
You're so beautiful.

1434
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:01,663
Big fan.
Big, big fan.

1435
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:03,965
Just gorgeous.
Just gorgeous, darling.

1436
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:06,634
Such a star.

1437
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:09,237
Thank you.

1438
01:10:09,239 --> 01:10:11,873
Thank you.

1439
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:16,344
Oh.

1440
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:28,489
- Clarelle.
-You inspire me.

1441
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:32,360
Clarelle, we love you.

1442
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:35,263
We love you, clarelle.

1443
01:10:35,265 --> 01:10:37,732
I'm gonna fucking find
somebody to fuck.

1444
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,304
Yeah.

1445
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,745
Clarelle, what are you?
What are you doing?

1446
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,347
Oh, yes, darling.

1447
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:53,748
Why are you carrying
those sticks?

1448
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,017
Would you like a photo?

1449
01:10:56,019 --> 01:10:58,853
Clarelle,
give me that pan.

1450
01:10:58,855 --> 01:11:02,323
Get off of me
and don't touch my things!

1451
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,426
Have you no manners, sir?

1452
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,894
I knew you had it in you.

1453
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:47,635
It was just a matter of time
before the world would see.

1454
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:53,074
I told you I could do it.

1455
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:57,912
Father
would have been proud.

1456
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,685
I knew you could do it,
dollface.

1457
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,022
Paul.

1458
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,861
Why now,
all of a sudden?

1459
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:23,037
For years, you wanted me
to do what you wanted.

1460
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,645
Now...

1461
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,847
I'm capable.

1462
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,053
You finally
got over yourself.

1463
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:42,523
You got out
of your own way.

1464
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:47,428
Eh, you get what you get
when you get it, right?

1465
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,432
I wouldn't have loved you
all these years

1466
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:54,001
if I didn't believe
in you.

1467
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:56,471
You're still as foxy
as the day we met.

1468
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:58,973
-Oh, don't talk that way.
-I've missed you.

1469
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,013
Oh, I've missed you, too.

1470
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:13,688
I never stopped.

1471
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,093
Come away with me.

1472
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:22,497
Just you and me,
the way it used to be.

1473
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,899
Leave
all this madness behind.

1474
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:29,871
--Clarelle?

1475
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:32,874
Oh, I guess
I'd better get back.

1476
01:13:32,876 --> 01:13:36,744
The stage manager
is waiting for me.

1477
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,112
Paul, let go of me.

1478
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,447
--Clarelle?

1479
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:43,518
-I said let go.
-Shh.

1480
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,281
Drink, Carrie,
drink, drink.

1481
01:15:53,283 --> 01:15:55,116
- Good, good, good, go, go, go.

1482
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:56,984
Okay, good girl,
good girl, good girl.

1483
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:09,330
Oh, we've got such
a great future together.

1484
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:14,702
Oh, look at ya.
Just like old times.

1485
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:17,204
Just you and I, kiddo.

1486
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,744
You okay?

1487
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:26,781
Jesus, you stupid
fucking beautiful bitch.

1488
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:33,321
Clarelle, open the door.

1489
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,791
Don't make me
kick the door in.

1490
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:39,226
- This party's over.

1491
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:41,696
--I'm ending it.

1492
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:43,064
-Tyrell?
-Gator?

1493
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,765
Oh, god.
Thank god.

1494
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,834
-Oh, fuck.
-Thank god, listen.
Look at me.

1495
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:49,103
Look at-- what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1496
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,272
Did you take everything
i gave you?

1497
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:53,341
God damn it, listen to me.
Go find clarelle, okay?

1498
01:16:53,343 --> 01:16:56,611
-Where is she?
-I don't-- go fucking
check her room, go.

1499
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:59,213
- Sorry, sorry, move.
-Fucking Christ.

1500
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:06,687
You're doing so good.

1501
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:09,724
- Yeah, just let go.
- -Open the door, clarelle!

1502
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,058
--That's it.

1503
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,060
-Clarelle!
-That's it.

1504
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:14,295
Open the door!

1505
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:19,266
Clarelle?

1506
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:22,203
Clarelle! Oh, my god,
what have you done?

1507
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:24,071
Somebody help!

1508
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:28,876
Oh, my god, fuck.
Somebody call 9-1-1.

1509
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:30,244
Somebody call
a doctor now!

1510
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,880
-Clarelle, clarelle.
-Somebody call 9-1-1!

1511
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:34,649
Tyrell,
there's no time to explain.

1512
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:36,984
She's not breathing
and her pulse is fading.

1513
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,720
Listen, I need you
to apply pressure here.

1514
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:41,288
There's too much blood.
There's too much blood.

1515
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,858
-There's too much--
-fucking apply the pressure!

1516
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,760
Don't worry
about your germ shit!

1517
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:50,097
Somebody call 9-1-1!

1518
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:52,400
I can't hear anything.

1519
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:54,301
I don't know
if she's breathing.

1520
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:58,172
Listen to me. Listen to me!
Listen to me, okay?

1521
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,307
We have to get her
to a hospital, okay?

1522
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:02,076
We have to put her
in this sheet.

1523
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,245
You get her legs,
I'll get her shoulders.

1524
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,413
-Okay. All right.
-Okay, on three.

1525
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:08,315
One, two, three!

1526
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,922
Let's get her out of here.

1527
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:18,292
Party's over, motherfuckers.

1528
01:18:18,294 --> 01:18:19,827
Get the fuck out of here.

1529
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:21,929
I'm shutting
this motherfucker down.

1530
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,699
Party is over!

1531
01:18:24,701 --> 01:18:26,867
Oh, god!

1532
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,437
I can't hold her!

1533
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:31,338
Come on,
i knew you could do it.

1534
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,274
You're almost there.
Aw, I can't wait to get you.

1535
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:43,117
Tell me what is going on!

1536
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:44,985
What is happening?

1537
01:18:44,987 --> 01:18:47,154
Tell me what is going on!

1538
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:49,457
- Fuck!
-What is happening?

1539
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:56,997
- She's dead!
She's dead!
-Oh, my god.

1540
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:58,999
Oh, god.

1541
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,168
Come on, we gotta get out!
Go, go, go.

1542
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,903
She's dead.

1543
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,405
She's dead.

1544
01:19:06,142 --> 01:19:08,943
Please don't go away.

1545
01:19:08,945 --> 01:19:10,511
Oh, god.

1546
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:18,185
Please, somebody help her.

1547
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,458
Please.

1548
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:30,464
Please come back.

1549
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,366
Please.

1550
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:34,969
Clarelle, don't go.

1551
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:37,438
No!

1552
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,073
No!
