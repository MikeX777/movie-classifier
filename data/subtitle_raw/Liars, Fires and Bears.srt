1
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,370
- Alright, Eve,
go on in have a seat.

2
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,173
Okay, Eve.

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,330
How are we doing today?

4
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,733
- Fine.

5
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,027
Very good.

6
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,673
We're gonna do something
a little different today.

7
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,517
So what I want you to
do is close your eyes

8
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:45,327
and imagine you're
walking through a forest.

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,170
Can you see the forest?

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,498
Yes.

11
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,773
- Can you
describe it for me?

12
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:08,467
- Coniferous
trees, dirt, it's cold

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,130
and I'm the only one there.

14
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,798
Very good.

15
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,603
What time of day is it?

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,515
- It's still light
out, but it's getting darker.

17
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,230
It reminds me of a place
my parents used to take me.

18
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,153
Mr. and Mrs. Webber?

19
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,073
- No, my real parents.

20
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:31,367
- Oh, okay.

21
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:37,667
You continue walking through
the forest and you see a bear.

22
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:45,367
What do you do?

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,500
Can it see me?

24
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,232
- Well maybe, and maybe not.

25
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,897
- Well, I guess
I sneak up on it with

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,770
a sledgehammer and
beat it to death.

27
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:02,103
It would have killed me
if I didn't kill it first.

28
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,097
- Okay.

29
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,327
Next thing, you're
still walking through

30
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,633
the forest and you see a wall.

31
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,697
Can you describe
the wall for me?

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,170
It's a big, ugly wall.

33
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,197
I don't know how
else to describe it.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,565
How tall is it?

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,330
- It's too tall
for me to reach the top.

36
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,973
- So, let's say
the wall has a hole in it.

37
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:32,267
What do you see
on the other side?

38
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:36,227
My brother.

39
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:38,327
Okay, very good.

40
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,733
Do you want to be on the other
side of the wall with him?

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,132
Yes.

42
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:45,167
- So how are
you going to do it?

43
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,197
- Well, I'll drag the
bear's dead body over

44
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,100
to the wall and use it
to help boost me up.

45
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,527
- Hi, um, do you have
a key to the bathroom?

46
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,898
- There is no key.

47
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,173
It's probably just stuck.

48
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,533
- You sure?

49
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,482
It felt locked.

50
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:29,397
- Nope, no lock.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,830
- Okay, thanks.

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,665
- Did you get it open okay?

53
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,970
- Yeah, I'm not
retarded or anything.

54
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:55,897
I got the door open.

55
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,270
You know what's
cool about texting?

56
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,917
Is that you could have
a whole conversation

57
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,559
with somebody who's
nowhere near as interesting

58
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:18,167
as the person you're
ignoring, right next to you.

59
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,167
I could use another drink soon.

60
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:30,827
I could use another drink soon.

61
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,232
- What are you doing?

62
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:33,667
- I'm just kidding around.

63
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,164
I just wanted another drink.

64
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,627
- I just brought you one.

65
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,580
- Yeah, I want another one.

66
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:40,527
- I think you've had enough.

67
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:42,533
- Well I don't think the
same things you think.

68
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:43,533
I think you should
probably do your job

69
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,473
and get me another drink.

70
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,397
- You know, why don't I go
ahead and call you a cab?

71
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,727
- Oh, that's sweet, thank
you for caring about me.

72
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:51,932
You know what?

73
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,827
Not so much about you,
but the other people on

74
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,473
the road, so let me go ahead
and call you a cab, okay?

75
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:57,497
- You know what?

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,630
Take a break on that.

77
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,650
I'm gonna go use
the bathroom again.

78
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,667
- If you leave, I'm
gonna call the cops.

79
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,527
- Okay, mom!

80
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:06,198
Be right back.

81
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,273
- Yeah, okay, we'll
see about that.

82
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,215
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

83
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,730
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

84
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,733
Come on, just unlock the
door, it's not your mom's car.

85
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,503
It's not mommy's car, come on.

86
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,032
It's okay.

87
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:55,927
It's okay, seriously.

88
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,903
Seriously, get out of my car.

89
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,700
All right, that's it.

90
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,330
Get back!

91
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,065
Get out of my car.

92
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,270
Seriously, get out of
my car before, like,

93
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,527
Chris Hanson shows
up or something.

94
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,903
You don't know who that -

95
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:17,273
Are you a special ed kid?

96
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,597
Are you one of the
ones that don't talk?

97
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,430
Yeah?

98
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:23,632
Hello?

99
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,927
Okay, what's your name?

100
00:06:24,933 --> 00:06:26,203
- Eve.

101
00:06:26,238 --> 00:06:27,432
- Eve?

102
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,267
Well what do you want, Eve, huh?

103
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,370
All right.

104
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,497
You probably got lost
or something, right?

105
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,170
It's okay, it's okay, calm down.

106
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,227
Here, $5.00.

107
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,603
Go get yourself an ice cream
float or something, huh?

108
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,333
Don't just look at it,
take it on your way.

109
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,667
All right, kid, get whatever
kind of ice cream you want.

110
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,697
20 whole dollars, plus
the five, 25 bucks.

111
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,170
Take it, take the
money, take it.

112
00:07:07,205 --> 00:07:08,567
Go!

113
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,227
Be gone.

114
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,432
Do you have a number?

115
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,367
Do you have something
that they tell you

116
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,067
to call when you get lost?

117
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:19,832
Hello, Eve?

118
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:21,467
All right, look.

119
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,870
I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna
open up your door very slowly,

120
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,767
I'll escort you
outside and then we'll

121
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:30,267
find out where you go, okay?

122
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,397
Cause I don't know.

123
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:44,597
- Are you seriously
going to drive like this?

124
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:48,065
- No, I got a ride.

125
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,883
- Well, I'm gonna get
your license plate

126
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,667
number and give it
to the cops, okay?

127
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:52,827
- You want to get in trouble?

128
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,133
Here's the keys
to juvenile hall.

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,433
Put them in the ignition,
drop it down into "D".

130
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:02,067
Just get us out of here,
just get us out of here.

131
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:03,832
No, not "D", not "D", not "D"!

132
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,827
"R", "R", I'm sorry,
that was my fault.

133
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,933
You're doing fine,
just keeping doing it.

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,500
Okay, okay, keep going.

135
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:30,032
Okay, this worked out.

136
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,497
All right, we're out of here.

137
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,097
Go ahead and pull it over.

138
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:38,715
Are you messing around, do
you know what you're doing?

139
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,797
You take the little foot and
you put it on the left pedal.

140
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,570
Don't look at me,
look at the road!

141
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,967
Oh, okay, that's a stop sign.

142
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:46,832
Your foot's on the wrong -

143
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:47,827
Okay, we're gonna wanna slow -

144
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,198
Can you reach that?

145
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,273
Seriously, left
pedal, right now.

146
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:52,597
Stop, stop, stop the car.

147
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,900
Good.

148
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,332
All right, you had your fun.

149
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,767
Get out of my car,
that was a blast.

150
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,567
- I need a ride.

151
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,097
- What?

152
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
I don't care.

153
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,627
I do not care.

154
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,903
There's buses running all night.

155
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:11,732
Go ahead and have fun.

156
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,567
- I need to get to Colorado.

157
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,303
- Get out of my car.

158
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,067
Don't look behind you, please.

159
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:24,099
There's a cop behind us.

160
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,097
Please let's just go.

161
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,370
Please, please, we'll
both get in trouble.

162
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:27,667
Let's go.

163
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,827
Okay, here's the plan.

164
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,932
See that street right there?

165
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:40,127
We're gonna turn into that,
I'm gonna count to three,

166
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,465
I'll grab a hold of
the steering wheel,

167
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,863
you just jump in the
back, we'll switch places.

168
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,227
Nod if you can hear me
and you're agreeing.

169
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:47,233
Okay, all right, you ready?

170
00:09:47,268 --> 00:09:48,932
One, two, three.

171
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,597
And go, go, go.

172
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,070
I'll turn it, I'll turn it.

173
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,297
Get back, go.

174
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,133
- Here, put that on your -

175
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,432
Just stay down, stay down.

176
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:04,697
I'm down here!

177
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,370
- Alright, just
stay down, be quiet.

178
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:28,967
- License and
registration, please.

179
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:30,727
Uh, yeah, sure, sure.

180
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,173
Here, I got it, I got it.

181
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,000
Sir, I can't see those.

182
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,733
And your license?

183
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:46,633
- Yeah.

184
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,627
It must have fallen out.

185
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,730
- Where are you coming from?

186
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:04,203
- Just had a night out with
some friends, that's all.

187
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:06,330
- Yeah, what were their names?

188
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:12,273
- Colby and Zelda.

189
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,465
- Have you been
drinking tonight, sir?

190
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,070
- No, I had a beer earlier,
much, much earlier.

191
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:23,232
Very early.

192
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,067
- Step out
of the car, please.

193
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:25,497
- Okay.

194
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,327
- Eve?

195
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,432
- It's very
difficult to punish a child.

196
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:10,227
They often don't understand
the severity of their actions

197
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,632
or even why they're
being punished.

198
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,097
Instead of trying to
correct the problem,

199
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,670
they often work harder to
avoid getting caught again.

200
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,200
I fear, in this case,
that applies to you.

201
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,900
This is the second time
you've been in my courtroom.

202
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,300
You don't seem to
understand your actions

203
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:31,565
endanger others and yourself.

204
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,100
My advice to you is you
seriously need to grow up.

205
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:36,265
- But what happened was -

206
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,930
- This is your last chance.

207
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:41,073
Show up here again, you're
looking at serious jail time.

208
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:45,197
For now, your license
is restricted.

209
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,970
You will pay the fine,
you will go to AA,

210
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,251
you will not come back here.

211
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:53,497
Do you think you can do that?

212
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,230
- I have to.

213
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,398
- What was that?

214
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,073
- I said I have to
stop being so childish.

215
00:13:57,108 --> 00:14:00,067
You're absolutely right, sir.

216
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:01,727
- Yes, you do!

217
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,897
- One of the
doors was unlocked.

218
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,730
What is the probability
that the first door

219
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,833
he opens will be unlocked?

220
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,397
Copy the problem into
your notebooks and write

221
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:16,827
your answer in a fraction
using the lowest terms.

222
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,203
Be sure to show your work.

223
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,333
Who's Daniel?

224
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:27,467
My brother.

225
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,973
- I heard you ran
away again last night.

226
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,403
Why do you keep doing that?

227
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,230
Your parents are always going
to come looking for you.

228
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,750
And then they're
going to find you.

229
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,267
Then you're going
to get in trouble.

230
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,173
- They're not my real parents.

231
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
- Hello?

232
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,865
- Yeah?

233
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,430
- Uh, I've got my car in there.

234
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:06,851
What kind of car?

235
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:08,232
- White hatchback?

236
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:10,567
Alright, just a sec.

237
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,330
Yeah, gonna be
$300 to get it out.

238
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,232
- $300?

239
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,327
Yeah.

240
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,133
Just pass it through the fence.

241
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:24,332
- I'm not gonna -

242
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,927
Look, my wallet is
in the car in there.

243
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,333
Can -

244
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,730
I need to get in.

245
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,330
Thanks.

246
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,973
- Yep.

247
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,903
- Did you happen to
find a jacket in here?

248
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:53,400
No, not that I saw.

249
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,032
- Funny story.

250
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:05,727
A little girl stole my
coat, had my wallet in it.

251
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,633
What -

252
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,473
- Lookin' great.

253
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:26,097
- Oh, Dave.

254
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,070
- Don't make me go out there.

255
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,533
- Did you get anything?

256
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:30,498
- Yeah...

257
00:16:30,533 --> 00:16:31,665
Let's see.

258
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,330
- Here, I think that
one's pretty good.

259
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,297
That is too cute.

260
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,665
I know.

261
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,600
If I would have kept recording
for five more seconds,

262
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:41,830
he ends up puking on her.

263
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,265
Slightly less cute.

264
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,600
No, no, it was cute.

265
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,032
She still liked him.

266
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,430
That's gross.

267
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,332
- I was gonna ask you...

268
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,667
Can you pay me in cash,
by chance, after this one?

269
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:56,927
I got my wallet stolen.

270
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,532
It's just hard to cash checks.

271
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,467
- Sure, where was
your wallet stolen?

272
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:05,867
- I don't know, I don't know.

273
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,867
Come on!

274
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,765
Look, what I'm asking is...

275
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,265
Since I called earlier,
how long is it going

276
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,370
to take before somebody
gets out here to help me?

277
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:15,527
- Sir, it's a large city.

278
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,880
This is not classified
as an emergency,

279
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:18,227
so the next available
police officer

280
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,151
will be there as
soon as they can be.

281
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,070
Which probably isn't
until early morning.

282
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:24,032
- Early morning?

283
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,497
Like, tomorrow
morning, that's great.

284
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,230
Okay, well I'll just leave
my house like this till then.

285
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,603
Cause that will be awesome.

286
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,173
- To survive a hike
through grisly bear country,

287
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,887
you have to make
your presence known.

288
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,694
If the wildlife
knows you're there,

289
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,328
it will probably
leave you alone.

290
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:50,927
But what happens when you come

291
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:55,073
face-to-face with a
thousand pound grisly bear?

292
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,697
There's three clear
options and two

293
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,470
of them will get you killed!

294
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,403
A. You fight.

295
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,230
Bad choice!

296
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,415
You don't stand a chance next to

297
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,597
the brute force of
a mighty grizzly.

298
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,130
B. You run.

299
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,365
Wrong again!

300
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,135
Bears can run at up
to 35 miles an hour.

301
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,832
You run and you're
guaranteed bear food.

302
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:20,897
There's only one option
that can save your life.

303
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,032
C. Play dead.

304
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:27,197
This goes against all
our human instincts,

305
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,330
but if they think you're
dead, they leave you alone.

306
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,798
Simple as that.

307
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:35,203
Lay face first on the
ground and protect your...

308
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,998
Don't, it's broken.

309
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,566
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you.

310
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,100
I'm in the bathroom,
I'll be right out.

311
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,465
It's all good.

312
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
- I'm sorry, are you watching
me from the bathroom?

313
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:24,465
Is that...

314
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,670
- I'm just finishing
my dinner, I'll be out.

315
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,127
Hey!

316
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:35,765
- Hey.

317
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,930
- Hey dude.

318
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,867
I'm sorry about that.

319
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,432
I'm Ricky.

320
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,397
I'd shake your hands,
but they're still wet.

321
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,200
So what can I get you?

322
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,103
- I'd like to buy a gun.

323
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:54,954
- Say that, what?

324
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:55,732
Say that again.

325
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:56,997
- I'd like to buy a gun, please.

326
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
- Gun, okay, relax,
there's no one here.

327
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,500
It's just me and you.

328
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,230
You going to pop someone?

329
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,332
- No.

330
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,097
- What do you need a gun for?

331
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,733
- For protection.

332
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,367
- For protection?

333
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,167
Okay.

334
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:17,233
It's a five day waiting period.

335
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,967
- You're a pawn shop, though.

336
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:22,632
- Yeah, this is a pawn shop.

337
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:27,227
- Look, I just want to
buy a gun, you know?

338
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,227
- It was a test, you
passed, I like you.

339
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,373
Come here, give me some.

340
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,130
You know, when you first
take one of these things out,

341
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:46,133
You want her, dude,
whoever, to...

342
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,070
You want to let them know
you're the boss now, right?

343
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:51,032
And you...

344
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,297
Well, come here, come here.

345
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:57,300
You have to learn
to be discreet.

346
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:02,232
You see that discreet?

347
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,627
You didn't even see that coming.

348
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:12,827
You're going to need bullets.

349
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:17,365
Hey, I don't have to
tell you that if you

350
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,470
get caught with that
weapon, I won't know you.

351
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,127
- I know you don't.

352
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,703
Good.

353
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,430
Ted.

354
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:42,598
What?

355
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,598
- I think I heard something.

356
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:47,073
Wake up!
- I didn't hear anything.

357
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:50,217
Come on, sweetie.

358
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:52,367
Probably dreaming.

359
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,770
- What time is it?

360
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,803
Carol, the door's wide open.

361
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:03,227
See if you can unclip it.

362
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:04,733
Okay.

363
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,327
- That's good.

364
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,867
This is really stuck.

365
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:59,297
- All
right, thank you.

366
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,200
You're welcome.

367
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,867
- The next ticket
to Denver, please.

368
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,930
- Where did you get this?

369
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,633
- My dad gave it to me for this.

370
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:19,473
- I'm sorry,
sweetie, I can't take

371
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:21,832
this without him being here.

372
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:25,127
Is there a phone number
I can reach your dad at?

373
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,197
They're supposed to be

374
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,970
a background check and stuff.

375
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:30,332
How did you get it?

376
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:31,927
- I went to a pawn
shop, the guy thought

377
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,598
I was a pretty righteous
dude, we bonded.

378
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:38,573
- Dave, you have
to get rid of that gun.

379
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:39,727
- Why?

380
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:42,401
I'm, like, totally
responsible with it.

381
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:45,070
- Dave,
please, that scares me,

382
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,067
seriously, get rid of it.

383
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,697
- Yeah, but what am
I going to do with it

384
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,932
if I get rid of it, you know?

385
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,497
I've got no one
here to protect me.

386
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,670
Besides, after something like
this, I'm a little scared.

387
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:03,097
- Then get out
of the house, Dave.

388
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,233
- With who?

389
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,332
I'm sleeping, Dave.

390
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:15,097
Maybe we can get a burger
or something tomorrow.

391
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,232
- What about Brio's?

392
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:21,227
- Fine, you have
to get rid of that gun.

393
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:22,597
- Really?

394
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,830
All right, that's great, okay.

395
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,527
- House got robbed, right?

396
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:01,873
- Yeah, I'm the guy.

397
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,100
Yikes.

398
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:13,497
Oh, wow, they took the picture
right out of the frame?

399
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,870
- No, that's just
a frame I like.

400
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,827
If you could please...

401
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,701
- Okay, that's weird.

402
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,570
Okay, what is that?

403
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:23,227
What is that?

404
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,698
- It's not mine.

405
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:28,433
I don't, I don't
know what that is.

406
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:30,100
- So that's not your frame.

407
00:30:30,135 --> 00:30:31,733
They brought a frame with them.

408
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:33,065
- No.

409
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,032
The frame's mine, they're
just empty frames.

410
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,297
I collect them and they're
over there and just...

411
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,832
It's not that, not a big deal.

412
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,667
We don't have to worry about
that, they weren't stolen.

413
00:30:43,702 --> 00:30:47,597
They're still here,
they're on my walls.

414
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,532
- Okay.

415
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:49,732
Let's just get a running count.

416
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:52,932
Which frames have
pictures missing and

417
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,697
which ones are just
weird frames on the wall?

418
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,930
- Okay, they're not
weird, empty frames.

419
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:58,303
It's just something I like.

420
00:30:58,338 --> 00:30:59,632
It's just kind of a reminder -

421
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,327
We're not talking
about the frames!

422
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,273
- So you're telling me these
frames aren't a clue at all?

423
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,897
- No, the frames aren't a clue.

424
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,933
- Do you have any clues?

425
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:09,932
Do you have any leads?

426
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:12,597
Did anybody say "Hey, cool TV!"

427
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,330
But they said it, like, you

428
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,833
could tell they
really wanted it?

429
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:17,565
- No!

430
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,730
- Okay, tell you what.

431
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,503
Just fill out this
police report.

432
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,297
Call this number.

433
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,767
And we'll just hope
that some stuff

434
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:32,584
turns up that looks
like your stuff.

435
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:34,858
And we'll say
"That's his stuff."

436
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,097
It's not going to
happen, though, man.

437
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,630
- Do you have any other advice?

438
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,630
This has all been
really helpful.

439
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,627
- They're just things, you know?

440
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:44,303
Thank you.

441
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:04,627
- Do I know you?

442
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,898
- Yeah, I was here last night.

443
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,465
- What are you
talking about, man?

444
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,130
- I was here last night, I
was looking around for...

445
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,230
Pawn shop things, alone.

446
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,830
- Test two, you passed.

447
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:25,067
So how did it go?

448
00:32:25,367 --> 00:32:27,297
- With what?

449
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,197
- You know.

450
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,032
- Yeah, no, nothing happened.

451
00:32:34,067 --> 00:32:38,067
- Hey, I'm not here to judge,
it's your fingerprints.

452
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:41,297
- Actually, yeah, that's
what I'm here for.

453
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,270
I don't want it anymore,
I changed my mind.

454
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:46,197
- No returns.

455
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,798
I barter.

456
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,197
- Barter?

457
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:53,598
- Trade good for goods.

458
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:55,498
You know, I could buy
that back off you,

459
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:58,803
but you'd get a fraction
back what you paid for it.

460
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:01,082
Catch my drift?

461
00:33:01,117 --> 00:33:03,327
- I think I do.

462
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,273
What kind of goods?

463
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,470
- Look around!

464
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:14,398
Got some TVs, got some stereos,

465
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:18,103
got some nice
suitcases, footballs.

466
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:19,130
You ride a motorcycle?

467
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:20,633
- No.

468
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:13,627
Hey, Ricky, you got
any camera equipment?

469
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:14,898
Mm-hmm, in the back,

470
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,833
just not shelf-ready,
that's all.

471
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,600
- You have a really
nice collection here.

472
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:22,130
- Thanks.

473
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:23,632
- Yeah.

474
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,467
Where'd you get it?

475
00:34:25,502 --> 00:34:28,032
- Sources.

476
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,567
Yeah, do you keep any
records of your sources?

477
00:34:29,602 --> 00:34:32,167
Like who brought
in specific stuff?

478
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:34,067
- That's not how it works.

479
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:38,973
- How does it work, I'd
really like to know?

480
00:34:39,008 --> 00:34:40,497
- Why?

481
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,365
- I'm very curious.

482
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,670
I'm willing to learn
anything you can tell me.

483
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:48,132
If you could teach
me anything...

484
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,197
If we could just work together,
I'd really, I need to know.

485
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,700
- Together?

486
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,073
Are you a cop?

487
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:00,697
Of course you're not!

488
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,870
You bought an illegal
weapon from me.

489
00:35:02,905 --> 00:35:04,227
- Yes.

490
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:10,733
- Maybe you should
come back later.

491
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:15,403
- All right, well, I'll
hold on to this then.

492
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:18,400
- Can't talk shop
now I'm on the clock.

493
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:19,770
Don't want to piss of the owner.

494
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:20,797
Okay.

495
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,130
- Cause that's me.

496
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:31,297
- You look nice.

497
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,930
Thank you.

498
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,403
- May I have
your name, please?

499
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:39,632
- Dave.

500
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,527
- Okay, Dave,
it'll be just a minute.

501
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,133
I can take your
coats if you'd like.

502
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:44,633
- Oh, thank you.

503
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:46,133
- Here.

504
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,367
- Thanks.

505
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:53,903
Sir?

506
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,167
- I'm all right, I'm fine.

507
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:10,473
- I can take
you two, right this way.

508
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,630
- What are you doing?

509
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:18,203
- Nothing, fine.

510
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,427
Ew.

511
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:34,832
I was meaning to get rid of it.

512
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:37,367
I was right on the way
to do it and then...

513
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:39,227
It's fine.

514
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,250
I don't need the table anymore.

515
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:43,267
It's very nice, it's lovely.

516
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,167
You can keep playing.

517
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:51,797
Sar -

518
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,332
Hey, I'm sorry, all right?

519
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:55,897
- It's okay, I'll see you later.

520
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,700
- No, look, let's just
go grab a burger or something.

521
00:36:57,735 --> 00:37:00,570
- No, I've had enough
of you tonight.

522
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:01,797
- Why are you still here then?

523
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,930
- Because we came in your car.

524
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:06,503
- So you want to get a burger?

525
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:08,100
- No.

526
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:13,203
Enjoy your kid's meal.

527
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:35,933
- Creepy little ghost
child again, all right.

528
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:37,897
What are you doing in here?

529
00:37:37,932 --> 00:37:39,327
How did you get back in here?

530
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,433
- I'm sorry about what
happened last time.

531
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,697
- I really don't care.

532
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,265
I really...

533
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,270
Just get out of the car.

534
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:56,503
I'll wait here all night,
get out of the car.

535
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,767
Get out of the car!

536
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,300
- I don't have anywhere to go.

537
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,730
- Are you hungry?

538
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,203
I'm hungry, I could eat.

539
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:26,800
How about you?

540
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,827
All right, what do you want?

541
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,365
- I don't have any money.

542
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,170
- It's all right,
I'll pay for it.

543
00:38:36,205 --> 00:38:37,232
What do you want?

544
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,197
Chicken tenders.

545
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,663
- Chicken tenders, all right.

546
00:38:39,698 --> 00:38:41,127
Excuse me, could I get some -

547
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,873
- And some fries.

548
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:44,197
- Fries.

549
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,532
Can I -

550
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:49,497
- And a fruit cup, a
lemonade, extra BBQ sauce.

551
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,170
- Can I get two cheeseburgers
and two cokes, please.

552
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,727
I'm not getting all that.

553
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,933
- Do you know how many
calories are in a sandwich?

554
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,647
- No, how many?

555
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,327
900.

556
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:04,065
- I don't care.

557
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,865
I saw it on TV.

558
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,200
I thought you
would want to know.

559
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,070
- So what do you want,
what are you doing?

560
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:15,197
- I have to get to my brother.

561
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,365
- Why?

562
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,170
- Because he's the only
family I have left.

563
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,533
I was adopted after
my parents died.

564
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:27,803
They're awful people.

565
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:29,930
- Sorry.

566
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:32,683
- If I can get to my
brother, he can claim me.

567
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:35,433
And I know he'd be
better than those people.

568
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,433
- So where is he?

569
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:39,273
- Colorado.

570
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:42,100
- So are you just
going to take my car

571
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:43,567
and drive it all
the way to Colorado?

572
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:44,727
- It's not that far.

573
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:47,573
I printed off the maps,
we could still go.

574
00:39:47,608 --> 00:39:49,127
- Colorado?

575
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,483
Yeah, okay, I guess
I've time for a

576
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,267
12 hour trip to
Colorado, why not?

577
00:39:54,302 --> 00:39:56,327
Sounds like a blast.

578
00:39:58,067 --> 00:40:01,927
We're not
going to do that, okay?

579
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,203
- But I thought you
said you'd help me.

580
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,632
Yeah, I am helping you.

581
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:07,197
You're eating, you're not
walking the street right now.

582
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,332
I'm not going to take you on

583
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,197
some kind of
cross-country roadtrip.

584
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,765
Besides, I'm sure
you've got parents or

585
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,330
something looking
for you right now.

586
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:16,003
- They're not, I
made sure of it.

587
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,567
- I don't want to
know what that means.

588
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:20,197
What?

589
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,770
I don't, no.

590
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:24,197
You stay here, I'll call
you a cab, you can jump in

591
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,430
the back of that car, you
can go anywhere you want.

592
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:28,598
Anywhere.

593
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:30,673
Colorado, Disneyland,
I don't care.

594
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,727
- I'm not leaving this car.

595
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,398
- Okay, that's your choice.

596
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,203
But I'm going to
a very scary part

597
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:37,732
of town where little
girls don't go.

598
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:39,227
And if you think I'm
going to care about

599
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:41,633
your safety for one
second, guess what?

600
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:43,473
I'm not.

601
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,500
I don't care!

602
00:40:58,667 --> 00:40:59,832
Did you get enough to eat?

603
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:00,627
- I thought
you didn't care.

604
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,798
- I don't!

605
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:02,833
But they're like 900
calories, all right?

606
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:04,373
I don't want it.

607
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,132
Hey, give me the fast
food bag under your seat.

608
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:26,397
- He doesn't want your food,
he just wants your money.

609
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,032
- That guy?

610
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,932
He looks hungry.

611
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:29,627
Come on, give me the food.

612
00:41:30,233 --> 00:41:31,833
It's just a sandwich, come on.

613
00:41:31,868 --> 00:41:33,403
No.

614
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,233
All right.

615
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,770
Okay, roll down your window.

616
00:41:58,805 --> 00:41:59,697
No.

617
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,632
Come on, it's okay.

618
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:01,297
Just roll your window down.

619
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,733
Look, he...

620
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:04,167
Hold on!

621
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:09,797
You forgot this.

622
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,232
- Yeah,
sorry, could you -

623
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:12,497
- Want me to throw
that on there for you?

624
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,870
- Thanks, man,
I'd appreciate that.

625
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:15,227
- All right.

626
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,897
You gotta pop it.

627
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
Oh, okay.

628
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:30,932
- You're all set.

629
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:34,097
- Hey, man, do you
want this sandwich?

630
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,300
- Oh, God bless you, man.

631
00:42:36,335 --> 00:42:37,730
No problem.

632
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:38,733
Thank you, thank you.

633
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:39,932
Yeah.

634
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:40,727
- Have
a good night, guys.

635
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:41,598
Stay safe.

636
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:43,073
You too.

637
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,397
Okay.

638
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,267
Don't worry, it's not for you.

639
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:03,803
You're the most serious
little girl I've ever met.

640
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:06,470
It's been a pleasure.

641
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,727
- That's because I have
places to be and things to do.

642
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:10,818
And I need help.

643
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:11,961
- You need help?

644
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:13,032
I need help.

645
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:15,227
All right, everybody needs help.

646
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,967
Meet me in the back.

647
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:46,797
What?

648
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,400
In the back.

649
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:01,067
Hey, blood bro!

650
00:44:01,102 --> 00:44:02,597
- Hey.

651
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:05,767
- Just talk about it
later, talk about it later.

652
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:20,633
That's how you're dressed?

653
00:44:20,668 --> 00:44:23,773
- Well, for what?

654
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,851
- You have a lot to learn.

655
00:44:26,886 --> 00:44:28,970
You're going to need gloves.

656
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:35,367
This is all I have,
but it's better

657
00:44:35,402 --> 00:44:39,067
than what you have right now.

658
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:44,631
Oh, sorry about that.

659
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,130
Yeah, that works.

660
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,697
Saddle up, partner.

661
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,032
- What are we doing?

662
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:55,297
- Okay, what's
with the sketch mode?

663
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,230
Sketch mode?

664
00:44:56,233 --> 00:44:57,632
I thought we were going inside.

665
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,132
- I thought you wanted to
see where I got this stuff.

666
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,627
- Yeah, I thought you
were going to tell me inside.

667
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:02,632
- Okay.

668
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,432
So wait a minute...

669
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,727
Were you expecting
me to videotape

670
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:08,198
it and then show
it to you later?

671
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:10,198
We can pull it up via
satellite, but I was

672
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:12,073
pretty sure you wanted to
know where I got the stuff.

673
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:13,227
- I just don't know
what we're doing

674
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:14,373
and I've actually
got things to do.

675
00:45:14,408 --> 00:45:16,527
- You going to leave me?

676
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:18,827
You were going to
leave me, weren't you?

677
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:19,733
- I wasn't going
to leave you, man.

678
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:21,032
I'm not going to do that.

679
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:21,897
- Then why do
you want to go inside?

680
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,365
- I just would like...

681
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,470
I didn't know we were going
to do, like, a whole van trip.

682
00:45:25,505 --> 00:45:27,527
- You promised
me a ride in the van.

683
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:28,873
- I didn't, I didn't
make that promise.

684
00:45:28,908 --> 00:45:30,727
- I'm not going without you.

685
00:45:30,733 --> 00:45:32,903
- I'm not gonna get in the van.

686
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,932
I'm not gonna get in the van.

687
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:37,527
- There's somebody
looking at us, get in the van.

688
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,032
- There's somebody -

689
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:41,167
- There's somebody
looking at us, get in the van.

690
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:43,527
- But...

691
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,532
- There's seriously
somebody watching us.

692
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:47,197
- I can't stay out too
late, you know, I gotta...

693
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,130
- I promise,
it'll be fine, I promise.

694
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:50,573
- But, Rick, hold on.

695
00:45:50,608 --> 00:45:51,532
- It'll be fine.

696
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:52,827
- Just one second, I just...

697
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,873
Okay.

698
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:24,067
Hey, I don't know if this
is such a great idea.

699
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,370
- You're funny, partner!

700
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:36,532
- Yeah, I'm not really
kidding, though.

701
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:39,032
- We're driving
by and saw this and it's

702
00:46:39,067 --> 00:46:42,567
now saying that it looks like
there is no criminal activity.

703
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:43,927
That they -

704
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:45,032
- What are we doing?

705
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,597
- Goods, my friend, goods.

706
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,930
Going to get the goods.

707
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,833
You wanted to see them, right?

708
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,270
- You didn't really
answer my question.

709
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,017
- This is it.

710
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:26,332
Grab my hand.

711
00:47:26,367 --> 00:47:27,667
- All right, but the thing is -

712
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:28,427
- Grab my hand.

713
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:29,265
- What?

714
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,097
All right.

715
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,070
- Take a deep breath.

716
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:37,927
Dear Lord, please bless the
hallways we're about to enter.

717
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:42,803
Make this house nice,
big, and warm, and cozy.

718
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:45,830
We're about to rock out.

719
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,433
Amen.

720
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,930
This is gonna be good.

721
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:57,527
- Wait, it just seems to
me like we're about -

722
00:47:57,533 --> 00:48:00,273
- This gets scarier every time.

723
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,933
- Shoot him, be a man,
be a man, be a man.

724
00:48:17,968 --> 00:48:20,067
He doesn't have a
gun, you can do this.

725
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,100
- What are you doing?

726
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:31,232
What?

727
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:32,497
I...

728
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,927
- Two car garage.

729
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:52,797
- What, what, what, what, what?

730
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,070
- I'm just
checking your reaction.

731
00:48:54,105 --> 00:48:55,732
- Okay.

732
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,097
Okay.

733
00:48:57,132 --> 00:48:58,427
Ricky?

734
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:00,132
What?

735
00:49:00,167 --> 00:49:01,097
- Let's not do it.

736
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,365
There's no one home.

737
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,900
- Let's just get
away from the door.

738
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,903
- In and out,
in and out, in and out.

739
00:49:23,067 --> 00:49:25,082
- This is a citizen's arrest.

740
00:49:25,117 --> 00:49:27,097
This is a citizen's arrest.

741
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,400
Citizen's arrest.

742
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,865
Shh.

743
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,570
I got the goods, go
grab whatever you want.

744
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:37,627
What are you doing?

745
00:49:37,633 --> 00:49:38,832
Drop the TV.

746
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:40,197
- What are you talking about?

747
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,600
- This is a citizen's
arrest, drop the TV.

748
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:44,300
- What?

749
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:46,597
Hey!

750
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,470
Who the hell's down there?

751
00:49:47,505 --> 00:49:49,067
Hey, hey!

752
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:55,497
- I thought we were partners.

753
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,070
- You stole my stuff
from my apartment.

754
00:49:57,105 --> 00:49:58,532
I saw it in your store.

755
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:00,967
- Okay, so your plan
was to arrest me?

756
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:02,097
Son of a bitches!

757
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,532
- While robbing
someone with me?

758
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:04,897
- Break into my house,
I'm gonna bash your damn skull.

759
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,330
- You stop right there!

760
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,630
- Buddy, if you pull that
trigger, you better hope I die.

761
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:14,903
Cause I'm gonna
bash your skull in.

762
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:17,798
- Sir?

763
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:21,833
I actually don't know him,
I've got it under control -

764
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:23,365
- Quiet, partner!

765
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,170
- Just, will you put the
gun down, figure it out?

766
00:50:26,205 --> 00:50:28,097
- Listen to me, okay?

767
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,430
I'm in contr -

768
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:33,430
Do you know what
I'm gonna do to you?

769
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:35,127
You really don't
want to test me.

770
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,498
You want to test me?

771
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,603
Do you want to test me, huh?

772
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:46,903
- I didn't load the gun.

773
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:55,403
Go!

774
00:50:58,367 --> 00:50:59,567
Okay, we're just gonna
have to go to plan B.

775
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:01,227
You got to hurry.

776
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:04,397
- Oh!

777
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:07,717
- He's coming again,
he's coming again.

778
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:09,867
- Get out of
the car, assholes!

779
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:14,297
- Dangit!

780
00:51:15,267 --> 00:51:16,232
He's reloading.

781
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:17,632
- You live on Gilchrest, right?

782
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:19,097
- Yeah, what does that
have to do with anything?

783
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,330
- Meet you there in 30 minutes.

784
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,233
Okay, but...

785
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:43,797
I think you killed him.

786
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,930
- I've never killed
anyone before.

787
00:51:46,933 --> 00:51:48,503
- We should probably go.

788
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,165
- I didn't mean to.

789
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,200
That's what you're going
to tell everyone, right,

790
00:51:51,235 --> 00:51:52,800
that I didn't mean to, right?

791
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:55,170
- Yeah.

792
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,430
I didn't mean to.

793
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:05,633
It's all -

794
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,397
- Please don't take
a picture of me.

795
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,815
- It's not.

796
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,230
It's video.

797
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:22,698
- What, what, what?

798
00:52:22,733 --> 00:52:24,732
All right, don't video me.

799
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,297
- It's just a video,
man, it's just a video.

800
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,900
- Running only
proves you're guilty.

801
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:40,327
- Get in, I have Google Maps.

802
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,300
- All right.

803
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,670
We just got to get to a police
station and explain things.

804
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:51,797
- You can't go to the police.

805
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,332
- We have to.

806
00:52:53,367 --> 00:52:55,597
I'll tell them first.

807
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,865
Because if I don't,
they're going to think...

808
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,700
They're going to think I
ripped that guy's house off.

809
00:53:00,735 --> 00:53:01,865
- If you go to the
Police Station,

810
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,213
you'll have to tell
them what happened.

811
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:04,527
Then you're going to
have to mention me

812
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:07,773
and I can't let you do that.

813
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,070
- All right, what do
you want me to do?

814
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,927
- Take me
to a bus station.

815
00:53:12,933 --> 00:53:15,633
If you want to get
rid of me so badly.

816
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,367
- It doesn't sound like
too bad of an idea.

817
00:53:39,267 --> 00:53:41,297
- I have to go to the bathroom.

818
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:44,073
- Great, I'll be right here.

819
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,130
- Hey, buddy, it sure looks
like a long line we're in.

820
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:57,067
Glad we get along.

821
00:53:57,102 --> 00:53:58,532
- Yeah.

822
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:01,667
- You know, I'd be willing to
wait for you, if you'd like.

823
00:54:01,702 --> 00:54:03,132
I'd do it for ten bucks.

824
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:04,927
- I got it under
control, thanks.

825
00:54:04,933 --> 00:54:07,073
- All right.

826
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,100
How about five bucks?

827
00:54:12,135 --> 00:54:13,132
Five bucks.

828
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,032
- You know what?

829
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:17,627
No thank you, no thank you.

830
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,203
- All right.

831
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:24,527
- Hey, man, do you
have ten bucks?

832
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:26,332
- No.

833
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:28,667
- Is that your
beautiful daughter?

834
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:29,927
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

835
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,365
- You like magic little girl?

836
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,365
- You know,
guys, she's not a fan.

837
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,230
- I was just trying to
show her magic, man!

838
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:43,597
- Know any other bus stations?

839
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:50,532
- Oh, hey buddy.

840
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:51,867
- Hey, how's it going, guys?

841
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:53,397
What do you want now?

842
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,570
- How about ten bucks and
we don't call the cops.

843
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:02,297
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

844
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,613
- Hey, how about
five a piece, we go.

845
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:08,927
- Yeah, that's $10,
which I don't have.

846
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:10,332
Not going to give it to you.

847
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:13,732
- How about for eight bucks,
we won't call the cops

848
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:17,797
and we can get you out of here
without you being recognized?

849
00:55:18,933 --> 00:55:20,973
- What are you talking about?

850
00:55:26,267 --> 00:55:27,627
- This man
is wanted for questioning

851
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:31,133
in the attempted
robbery of a local home.

852
00:55:31,433 --> 00:55:35,303
If you do see this man, contact
authorities immediately.

853
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:39,897
- How about a dollar
and I don't scream?

854
00:55:43,367 --> 00:55:44,297
- Here.

855
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,070
Enjoy your night.

856
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,865
Eve, go get on a bus.

857
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,230
- Just take me
to Colorado Springs.

858
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,073
My brother can talk to the cops.

859
00:56:13,108 --> 00:56:15,097
He's in law school.

860
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,230
I'm your alibi.

861
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:23,273
He could help both of us out.

862
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,632
- It's a good idea.

863
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:45,697
It's a good idea to get
out of town for a while.

864
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,330
So that's probably
what I'll do, anyway.

865
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:49,373
So it's not that...

866
00:56:59,867 --> 00:57:02,267
You open the garage?

867
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:08,173
And that's what happened
after you ditched me.

868
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:09,032
- Dave.

869
00:57:09,067 --> 00:57:10,297
- I'm serious.

870
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,732
There's police out there
right now looking for me

871
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:14,827
thinking I'm some sort of
master criminal or something.

872
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,333
And I'm not.

873
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:21,032
And I'm scared and I just...

874
00:57:21,067 --> 00:57:23,527
I got to get her to her
brother in Colorado Springs

875
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:25,798
because he's a lawyer, right?

876
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:27,065
And, you know, he
could help me out.

877
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:29,463
And I'm a witness,
she's a witness, right?

878
00:57:29,498 --> 00:57:31,827
So, I think this whole
thing will blow over.

879
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:34,373
- Dave, I don't see how
that's going to work.

880
00:57:34,408 --> 00:57:35,827
She's an alibi.

881
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:36,750
What are you?

882
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:37,632
- An alibi.

883
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,227
- See, this
is going to work out.

884
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:40,465
- Fine, whatever.

885
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,032
What do you want from me?

886
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:45,627
- It's nothing too big,
you know, I just...

887
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:48,565
I just need your car.

888
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,070
Mine's on the news, so
they'll pull it over.

889
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:53,527
- No.

890
00:57:54,067 --> 00:57:55,297
- Why?

891
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:59,073
- Don't put me in
this position, Dave!

892
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,667
I know you're a good guy, kid.

893
00:58:01,702 --> 00:58:02,827
- What?

894
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,598
- I know
you're a good kid.

895
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:07,373
And I don't want a
kid driving my car.

896
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,965
- Yeah, of course not.

897
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,830
That won't happen.

898
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,073
Can you just wait
in the other room?

899
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:23,227
Wait, wait.

900
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,298
Why do you think I'm a kid?

901
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,903
- Because you show up
late every day to work.

902
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,800
- No, I don't.

903
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:30,632
- Because you've never done

904
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:32,367
anything to make
me think otherwise.

905
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:45,073
- I just need your help.

906
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:50,297
- I don't know about that, Dave.

907
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,330
- What part?

908
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:56,333
- I don't know.

909
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,685
- What are you doing?

910
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,032
Stop following me, okay?

911
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:04,597
She said no, that's
it, this is the end.

912
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,870
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry.

913
00:59:05,905 --> 00:59:07,827
I've got nothing left.

914
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,765
- Is she going to call the cops?

915
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,570
- No, she's not going
to call the cops.

916
00:59:14,605 --> 00:59:16,827
- How do you know?

917
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:20,697
- Because I trust her.

918
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,933
- Why?

919
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,930
- Because I'm kind of an
idiot and she still likes me.

920
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,632
- Well, if she
likes you and isn't going

921
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:33,467
to call the police, why don't
we just borrow her keys?

922
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:35,427
- Hey, that's called stealing.

923
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:38,633
- Do you want to go to jail
and never see her again?

924
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,800
- I think we have plenty
more options available.

925
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,170
And I don't...

926
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:24,573
- You need a disguise.

927
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:26,198
- What?

928
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:28,033
A disguise.

929
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,430
- Eve, I'm fine.

930
01:00:30,433 --> 01:00:33,433
I think if we just keep
going, it'll work itself out.

931
01:00:33,468 --> 01:00:36,433
- What if somebody
recognizes you?

932
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,230
Hello, Eve.

933
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:44,473
There's three things you
need to know about me.

934
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:46,797
I'm a fast runner,
I like mathematics,

935
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,330
and I'm incredibly
mature for my age.

936
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:52,173
- This isn't the time.

937
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,300
- It's green, I
don't wear green.

938
01:01:06,633 --> 01:01:10,303
You know, I was eating chips
and he had chips and he felt

939
01:01:10,338 --> 01:01:12,400
like he didn't have
enough chips as me.

940
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:16,630
I said "Back off, my chips."

941
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:18,498
He took my chips anyway.

942
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:22,433
And I said "You take another
chip, I'm gonna clock you."

943
01:01:22,468 --> 01:01:26,703
And he took a chip and I
hauled off and hit him.

944
01:01:26,738 --> 01:01:27,830
And then he hit
me back, we rolled

945
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:30,032
around, it was kind of a mess.

946
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:34,567
And we both really didn't know
how to fight, still don't,

947
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:39,067
and yeah, we stopped talking
for I don't know how long.

948
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,583
I don't know, he got
a hold of me online.

949
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:44,732
And he's like "Hey,
what's going on?"

950
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:49,327
We were older and I was like
"It's great to hear from you."

951
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:52,373
And he told me he got in
some kind of accident,

952
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:57,032
messed up his foot, broke it.

953
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:59,527
And then when they went
to take the cast off,

954
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:04,533
I guess they found a
tumor or something.

955
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:07,727
He said it was no big deal.

956
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:09,673
And he really wanted
to see my stuff

957
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:13,167
and I was like "Sure".

958
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,032
I don't know.

959
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,797
Then like happened, right?

960
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,700
Didn't get around to it.

961
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:23,032
Stuff came up.

962
01:02:23,067 --> 01:02:24,297
Anyway, he got a
hold of me again.

963
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,230
Except it wasn't
him, it was a...

964
01:02:27,533 --> 01:02:31,403
It was an invitation
to his funeral.

965
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:36,433
And...

966
01:02:39,933 --> 01:02:41,032
I don't know, I just realized

967
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:44,167
that someone was
reaching out to me.

968
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:48,273
And I didn't take the opportunity
or the time to reach back.

969
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:52,297
- I guess we all go through life

970
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:55,470
with "welcome"
written on our backs.

971
01:03:01,533 --> 01:03:02,903
- Yep.

972
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:13,703
- May I please
use your bathroom, sir?

973
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,303
What are we doing?

974
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,865
- I just, I need to take a nap.

975
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,330
Just for a couple of hours.

976
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,065
Really?

977
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,585
It's not that far.

978
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,070
Yeah.

979
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,470
Just don't keep the car
running the whole time

980
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:56,197
and crack a window for me, okay?

981
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,665
You should get some
sleep, too, huh?

982
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,500
Just for a little bit,
just for a little bit.

983
01:05:08,133 --> 01:05:09,673
Eve?

984
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,930
Eve, you gotta shut the car off,

985
01:05:12,933 --> 01:05:15,373
you're going to run
the battery down.

986
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:19,667
Gotta shut the car off.

987
01:05:20,867 --> 01:05:22,527
Eve?

988
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,903
Eve?

989
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:27,127
Eve?

990
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:46,333
- Good, you're awake.

991
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:51,333
- Did you drive
the whole way here?

992
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:52,633
- Somebody had to.

993
01:05:52,668 --> 01:05:54,373
Coffee?

994
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,700
- Okay, don't drive my car.

995
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:01,297
- I got us here.

996
01:06:02,233 --> 01:06:04,303
- Just don't drive the car.

997
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:06,370
Watch your feet.

998
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:11,103
Okay, you're sure he lives here?

999
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,570
It's what my map said.

1000
01:06:14,605 --> 01:06:17,397
- Okay, well...

1001
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,930
Guess this is it.

1002
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:27,067
It just doesn't look like
anybody lives here, Eve.

1003
01:06:27,102 --> 01:06:29,727
- Well, I
think somebody does.

1004
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,370
- Hey, Derek, I think
your daughter is here.

1005
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:53,397
- No, we made a mistake, sorry.

1006
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,470
- Nevermind.

1007
01:07:02,967 --> 01:07:05,067
- It might be a house
next door, or something.

1008
01:07:05,102 --> 01:07:07,267
Or some place close.

1009
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:08,727
All right?

1010
01:07:26,233 --> 01:07:27,698
- Eve.

1011
01:07:27,733 --> 01:07:29,473
Daniel!

1012
01:07:34,067 --> 01:07:35,697
- What are you doing here?

1013
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,432
This is Dave.

1014
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:40,067
He helped me find you.

1015
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:42,327
- Hi.

1016
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,303
- Hey man.

1017
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,530
What about the people that
are looking after you?

1018
01:07:47,533 --> 01:07:51,298
- I couldn't stay
with them anymore.

1019
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,373
- Aren't they going
to be looking for you?

1020
01:07:53,408 --> 01:07:55,167
- Nope.

1021
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,670
- Hold on one second, okay?

1022
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,397
- Okay.

1023
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:11,227
I told you.

1024
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:12,398
- I know.

1025
01:08:12,433 --> 01:08:13,765
But, Eve, I don't think
we should stay here.

1026
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,200
I think your brother's
probably really busy, okay?

1027
01:08:16,235 --> 01:08:17,600
- No!

1028
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,330
- Hey,
turn the music down.

1029
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:33,565
- No!

1030
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,130
- We'll come back tomorrow.

1031
01:08:34,133 --> 01:08:35,603
- No.

1032
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,230
Can we trust him?

1033
01:08:40,233 --> 01:08:41,032
- Yes!

1034
01:08:41,067 --> 01:08:42,067
Is he a cop?

1035
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:43,697
- No.

1036
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,370
- Come on in.

1037
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:01,347
Hey, no, no, no.

1038
01:09:01,382 --> 01:09:03,327
Don't go over there.

1039
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,830
It's right over here.

1040
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,473
Let's go.

1041
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:40,327
Have a seat.

1042
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:57,067
- So, Even tells
me you went to law school?

1043
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:05,333
- I know the justice
system pretty well.

1044
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:15,900
- Are you going to be able
to help us with this mess?

1045
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:19,997
- What mess?

1046
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,127
- Dave, he can help
us out in the morning.

1047
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:27,203
I'm just kind of tired.

1048
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:30,003
- Uh, yeah.

1049
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,065
Do you want to...

1050
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,630
Why don't you just
sleep on my bed tonight?

1051
01:10:34,633 --> 01:10:39,633
And you good on that couch?

1052
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,600
- Sure.

1053
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,470
- Blanket and pillow.

1054
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:47,765
Here.

1055
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,565
Thanks.

1056
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,200
- Yeah, no problem.

1057
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,570
Dave, just keep the TV
really low if you use it.

1058
01:10:55,605 --> 01:10:58,527
- How long are they
going to be here?

1059
01:10:58,533 --> 01:11:00,473
Just...

1060
01:11:02,367 --> 01:11:06,427
Sorry, sorry, really sorry.

1061
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,370
- All right,
all right, all right.

1062
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,670
This one's good.

1063
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,400
It's a little shaky,
but it's good stuff.

1064
01:12:29,435 --> 01:12:31,130
It's all right.

1065
01:12:42,333 --> 01:12:44,501
- It's Dave
and he's asleep.

1066
01:12:44,536 --> 01:12:46,670
He's fine, he just passed out.

1067
01:12:46,705 --> 01:12:48,327
Dawg, he's leaving.

1068
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:49,365
Why?

1069
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:50,565
Why?

1070
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,730
Cause he was watching
me work earlier.

1071
01:12:52,733 --> 01:12:54,103
- What are
you talking about?

1072
01:12:54,138 --> 01:12:55,330
They just showed up.

1073
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:58,373
I just put them both
to sleep, they're fine.

1074
01:12:58,408 --> 01:12:59,627
I don't know, man.

1075
01:12:59,633 --> 01:13:00,933
You shouldn't even
be fine if you're

1076
01:13:00,968 --> 01:13:02,350
hanging out with
your little sister.

1077
01:13:02,385 --> 01:13:03,698
- You're
being paranoid.

1078
01:13:03,733 --> 01:13:05,165
- There aren't
many things more terrifying

1079
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,230
than losing a child, as Ted
and Carol Webber can attest to.

1080
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:10,250
Ted and Carol are
the newly adoptive

1081
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,076
parents of nine year
old Eve Schneider.

1082
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:13,969
After last night's
devastating fire,

1083
01:13:14,004 --> 01:13:15,827
the nine year old
was assumed dead.

1084
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:17,165
But after the smoke had cleared,

1085
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,730
police found evidence
that said otherwise.

1086
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:21,698
Melissa Duran reports.

1087
01:13:21,733 --> 01:13:23,503
- Well, Gary,
I'm standing right in front

1088
01:13:23,538 --> 01:13:25,717
of the Metrol Police
Station, where I just

1089
01:13:25,752 --> 01:13:27,897
finished talking to
Detective Mark Benson.

1090
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,730
He tells me that inside of the
burnt remains, they actually

1091
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:33,800
found no trace of nine
year old Eve Schneider.

1092
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:36,867
What they did find was a
trail of burnt gasoline

1093
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:39,199
that led from the
house to the backyard.

1094
01:13:39,234 --> 01:13:41,497
Now police believe
that this fire may

1095
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,330
have been a cover-up
for a kidnapping.

1096
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:47,233
And they believe it could all
be linked back to this man.

1097
01:13:48,433 --> 01:13:49,632
No.

1098
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:51,467
- Reporting
live, Melissa Duran.

1099
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,800
- My friends come here
and smoke you out all the time.

1100
01:13:56,835 --> 01:13:58,032
All the time!

1101
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,127
- Eve, Eve, come
on, come on, come on.

1102
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:00,332
We need to go, we need to leave.

1103
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:02,327
We need to get out
of here, all right?

1104
01:14:05,267 --> 01:14:06,797
- Wait, not
that way, not that way.

1105
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,932
Daniel!

1106
01:14:07,967 --> 01:14:10,797
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1107
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,033
- Hey,
are you spying on me?

1108
01:14:13,068 --> 01:14:14,198
No, no, it was just...

1109
01:14:14,233 --> 01:14:15,273
- You
watching me while I work?

1110
01:14:15,308 --> 01:14:16,132
No!

1111
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:18,227
- Hey, hey, relax, relax.

1112
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:22,932
Stop!

1113
01:14:22,967 --> 01:14:24,747
Let him alone.

1114
01:14:24,782 --> 01:14:26,527
Leave him alone!

1115
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:20,427
I'm sorry, Dave.

1116
01:15:26,267 --> 01:15:28,327
- Sorry for what?

1117
01:15:32,267 --> 01:15:33,797
Sorry for what?

1118
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,300
Bringing me out here in
the middle of nowhere

1119
01:15:35,335 --> 01:15:37,430
just so I can meet
your lawyer brother?

1120
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,670
You know, I'm not the only
one on TV anymore, Eve.

1121
01:15:53,933 --> 01:15:56,833
It said you burned down
your parents' house.

1122
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,130
Is that true?

1123
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:06,203
Look at me.

1124
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:52,427
What?

1125
01:16:54,633 --> 01:16:56,968
- I burned my house
down so they would

1126
01:16:57,003 --> 01:16:59,303
think I was dead
and not look for me.

1127
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,865
- Why didn't you
just go to the cops?

1128
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,400
Somebody picks on you,
somebody hits you, somebody

1129
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:14,900
abuses you, you just going
to burn their house down?

1130
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:16,270
Think!

1131
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:22,467
- They didn't abuse me.

1132
01:17:24,067 --> 01:17:25,427
- What?

1133
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:28,403
- They didn't abuse me.

1134
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:36,067
- I thought you said
they were awful people.

1135
01:17:36,133 --> 01:17:37,265
- I don't know.

1136
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,832
- What do you mean
you don't know?

1137
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:40,627
- I don't know if
they're awful people.

1138
01:17:40,633 --> 01:17:43,265
- How do you not know?

1139
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:46,470
- They were never going to
let me live with my brother.

1140
01:17:46,505 --> 01:17:50,327
- Oh, okay.

1141
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,265
That's great.

1142
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,170
You know, he's not going to
let you live with him, either.

1143
01:17:54,205 --> 01:17:56,397
You know that, right?

1144
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,800
You know, it doesn't matter.

1145
01:18:01,835 --> 01:18:05,200
Get in the car.

1146
01:18:05,235 --> 01:18:06,817
Get in.

1147
01:18:06,852 --> 01:18:08,400
No!

1148
01:18:31,933 --> 01:18:33,903
- Ah, that's fine.

1149
01:18:46,933 --> 01:18:48,573
- I really need
to eat something.

1150
01:18:48,608 --> 01:18:50,827
- No.

1151
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:54,403
No more talk and no more talking
for the rest of the trip.

1152
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,798
- Dave, I really need
to eat something.

1153
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:01,373
- Do you have any idea
what you've done to me?

1154
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:02,637
Done to my life?

1155
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:03,832
You know what?

1156
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:07,097
Just say "no", because
you have no idea.

1157
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,383
You know, you're just
a walking little curse.

1158
01:19:10,418 --> 01:19:13,357
- Dave, I need to eat
something, I'm sorry.

1159
01:19:13,392 --> 01:19:16,297
- All right, here's
what's going to happen.

1160
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,100
We're not going to do what you
want for the rest of the trip

1161
01:19:18,135 --> 01:19:19,670
we're going to do what I want
for the rest of the trip.

1162
01:19:19,705 --> 01:19:21,927
And what I want is for
nothing else to go wrong.

1163
01:19:21,933 --> 01:19:23,773
Starting now.

1164
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,570
- Whoa, shit!

1165
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:30,067
Oh.

1166
01:19:45,767 --> 01:19:47,327
Okay.

1167
01:19:48,267 --> 01:19:51,127
Okay, let's just sit here.

1168
01:20:53,633 --> 01:20:55,403
- Tire blew out?

1169
01:20:57,233 --> 01:20:58,598
- Yeah.

1170
01:20:58,633 --> 01:20:59,832
- Well let me help you out.

1171
01:20:59,867 --> 01:21:01,367
I'll get you back on
the road in no time.

1172
01:21:01,402 --> 01:21:03,127
- Oh, you know, I
got it, actually.

1173
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:03,898
I'm all right.

1174
01:21:03,933 --> 01:21:06,273
- I don't mind at all.

1175
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:08,697
- Okay.

1176
01:21:34,533 --> 01:21:35,765
Thanks again.

1177
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,365
Oh, no problem.

1178
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,270
Always happy to help, bud.

1179
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,065
See?

1180
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,430
Twice as fast.

1181
01:21:57,433 --> 01:21:58,533
You were right, man.

1182
01:21:58,568 --> 01:22:00,098
Thanks.

1183
01:22:00,133 --> 01:22:01,232
Not a problem.

1184
01:22:01,267 --> 01:22:02,067
Hope your day turns
out much better.

1185
01:22:02,102 --> 01:22:03,597
- I hope so, too.

1186
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,330
Have a good one.

1187
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,133
- Yeah.

1188
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:29,473
- We're going to be fine.

1189
01:22:30,267 --> 01:22:31,927
Just...

1190
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:34,685
Eve?

1191
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,432
Eve!

1192
01:22:36,467 --> 01:22:38,797
Hey, hey, hey.

1193
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:41,698
Eve!

1194
01:22:41,733 --> 01:22:43,933
All right, we'll go,
we'll go, we'll just...

1195
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,330
Doesn't look so bad.

1196
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,270
- It's no big deal.

1197
01:23:01,305 --> 01:23:02,032
Yeah.

1198
01:23:02,067 --> 01:23:03,097
- It's a minor problem.

1199
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,200
- All right, thanks, man.

1200
01:23:04,235 --> 01:23:05,330
- License?

1201
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:07,531
Uh, yeah, but we're...

1202
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:09,730
So it's good, right?

1203
01:23:09,733 --> 01:23:12,133
- Yeah, it's just for
precautionary purposes.

1204
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:13,469
Insurance thing, yeah.

1205
01:23:13,504 --> 01:23:16,015
All right, yeah.

1206
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:18,527
Yeah, no big deal.

1207
01:23:22,767 --> 01:23:25,827
- Oh, let me check
it out for a second.

1208
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,030
- All right, yeah, sorry.

1209
01:23:27,065 --> 01:23:28,227
- I'll be right back.

1210
01:23:28,233 --> 01:23:29,280
- Okay.

1211
01:23:29,315 --> 01:23:30,327
- Stay put.

1212
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:41,903
Eve, Eve, you good?

1213
01:23:52,633 --> 01:23:53,565
- Sir!

1214
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,070
Out of the car, now.

1215
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,230
Sir, out of the car, now!

1216
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:04,473
Turn around.

1217
01:24:05,067 --> 01:24:06,567
Turn!

1218
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:10,170
Put your hands behind your head.

1219
01:24:10,205 --> 01:24:11,432
Interlock your fingers.

1220
01:24:11,467 --> 01:24:12,397
All right, officer, can

1221
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,530
you please look into the car?

1222
01:24:13,533 --> 01:24:15,032
Okay, I've got a sick -

1223
01:24:15,067 --> 01:24:16,127
- Start walking backwards
until I tell you to stop.

1224
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:17,332
Please!

1225
01:24:17,367 --> 01:24:18,967
- Walk backwards until
I tell you to stop!

1226
01:24:19,002 --> 01:24:20,427
I've got a sick girl.

1227
01:24:20,433 --> 01:24:21,603
- Sir, put your hands
on the hood of this car now!

1228
01:24:21,638 --> 01:24:22,732
Just listen to me.

1229
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:24,132
- Sir, do not reach
into the vehicle.

1230
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:25,247
- Please, you just
have to listen to me.

1231
01:24:25,282 --> 01:24:26,327
- Sir, I
will fire on you, sir.

1232
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:27,373
A sick girl!

1233
01:24:42,367 --> 01:24:44,227
- All right.

1234
01:24:44,233 --> 01:24:48,380
Well, the bullet missed
all your tendons and bone.

1235
01:24:48,415 --> 01:24:52,527
It passed through one
side, right out the other.

1236
01:24:52,533 --> 01:24:54,803
You're actually
incredibly lucky.

1237
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,300
- Yeah, that's what I'm
going to tell all my friends.

1238
01:25:01,867 --> 01:25:05,927
And now I get to heal in prison,
so it's even more perfect.

1239
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,530
- Now, Dave, I've never
actually been to prison -

1240
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:10,698
- Really?

1241
01:25:10,733 --> 01:25:12,900
- And my guess is
that you're going

1242
01:25:12,935 --> 01:25:15,067
to be a lot better
off with two arms.

1243
01:25:15,102 --> 01:25:17,197
- Cause of the rape?

1244
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,100
- Yes, because of the rape.

1245
01:25:20,135 --> 01:25:21,632
- Awesome.

1246
01:25:21,667 --> 01:25:25,597
- Listen, life's very
long until the end.

1247
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,470
Then it's not long enough.

1248
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,470
Well, that's lunch for me.

1249
01:25:30,505 --> 01:25:32,397
Good luck!

1250
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,070
- Sorry, guys, can I
ask her a few questions?

1251
01:25:50,105 --> 01:25:52,601
- You be all right?

1252
01:25:52,636 --> 01:25:55,097
Okay, be right outside.

1253
01:26:04,567 --> 01:26:06,397
Okay.

1254
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,300
So how are we doing, Eve?

1255
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:13,232
Do you need anything?

1256
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:15,527
- I just want to see Dave.

1257
01:26:15,533 --> 01:26:17,103
- That's not possible.

1258
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,632
- Why not?

1259
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,497
- Dave's in a lot of trouble.

1260
01:26:21,733 --> 01:26:24,373
But let's talk
about your parents.

1261
01:26:25,533 --> 01:26:28,232
Did they do anything
to upset you?

1262
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:32,067
- Ted and Carol don't love me
as much as they're pretending.

1263
01:26:32,102 --> 01:26:34,227
- And why do you think
they're pretending?

1264
01:26:34,233 --> 01:26:36,803
- They're just not my family.

1265
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,330
- Okay.

1266
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,870
Eve, nobody chooses
their parents.

1267
01:26:49,905 --> 01:26:51,932
I didn't.

1268
01:26:51,967 --> 01:26:54,667
But they chose you.

1269
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,700
I should go.

1270
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:06,827
- Remember what I said about
the bear in the forest?

1271
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,950
Do you think if I
would have given him

1272
01:27:08,985 --> 01:27:11,067
a sandwich, he would
have left me alone?

1273
01:27:11,102 --> 01:27:13,667
- It's worth a try.

1274
01:27:48,467 --> 01:27:49,232
- Steve!

1275
01:27:49,267 --> 01:27:50,232
Eve, what are you doing?

1276
01:27:50,267 --> 01:27:52,697
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

1277
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:54,330
- Stop, stop it.

1278
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,973
- I picked at these
things before.

1279
01:27:56,008 --> 01:27:57,267
- You're not listening, Eve.

1280
01:27:57,302 --> 01:27:58,567
Look at me.

1281
01:28:04,467 --> 01:28:05,127
I'm not leaving.

1282
01:28:05,133 --> 01:28:06,473
- Dave!

1283
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,230
- You're just a kid
and they're going to

1284
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:13,073
forgive you for the
mistakes you've made.

1285
01:28:13,108 --> 01:28:18,067
Okay, but I'm an adult.

1286
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:21,197
So I'm gonna try this whole

1287
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,970
taking responsibility
thing for once.

1288
01:28:27,067 --> 01:28:32,067
So just, you know, go be a kid.

1289
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,650
For once.

1290
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:36,100
All right?

1291
01:28:37,467 --> 01:28:38,827
You've got your
whole life to ruin,

1292
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:40,973
so just get out of here.

1293
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,270
Go on.

1294
01:29:04,067 --> 01:29:07,427
- One count of arson,
one count of kidnapping,

1295
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:10,803
one account of driving
without a valid license,

1296
01:29:10,838 --> 01:29:13,270
you confess to all these?

1297
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:17,132
- Yes.

1298
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:19,197
- Ms. Schneider, you do
understand that you are

1299
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,600
under our protection and
that nothing can happen

1300
01:29:20,635 --> 01:29:22,630
to you while you are
under our protection?

1301
01:29:22,633 --> 01:29:24,333
- Yes.

1302
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:28,163
- Did Mr. Pilcher influence what

1303
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:30,627
you have to say
today in any way?

1304
01:29:37,933 --> 01:29:39,433
- Yes.

1305
01:29:40,133 --> 01:29:41,403
- He did?

1306
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:47,100
And how did he influence
your testimony today?

1307
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,370
- I used to lie a lot.

1308
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,565
And I lied to Dave.

1309
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,930
He was the first person I
trusted after my parents died.

1310
01:29:57,933 --> 01:30:00,373
And I lied to him.

1311
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:06,333
I regret that now and I'm
gonna try and stop lying.

1312
01:30:10,067 --> 01:30:12,397
- Well, Mr. Pilcher.

1313
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:14,830
There's no further
evidence against you,

1314
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,465
thanks to Miss
Schneider's testimony.

1315
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,400
The only outstanding
charge is resisting arrest.

1316
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,730
- That's it?

1317
01:30:23,733 --> 01:30:26,103
- Unless you wish to press
charges against Miss Schneider?

1318
01:30:26,138 --> 01:30:28,132
- No, no.

1319
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:30,667
- Mr. and Mrs. Webber, would
you like to press charges?

1320
01:30:30,702 --> 01:30:33,697
No, of course not.

1321
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,635
- Miss Schneider, I hereby
sentence you to two months

1322
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:41,570
in juvenile hall, with a
chance to parole in one.

1323
01:30:41,605 --> 01:30:44,597
Mr. Pilcher, I sentence
you to two weeks in

1324
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,430
county jail, with
six months probation.

1325
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:01,373
- It's going to be
okay, Eve, all right?

1326
01:31:01,408 --> 01:31:03,897
You're going to be just fine.

1327
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,670
- I know, I've
been there before.

1328
01:31:07,733 --> 01:31:10,403
Plus, I have friends
on the inside.

1329
01:31:10,567 --> 01:31:12,497
- You're serious?

1330
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,370
- Bye, Dave.

1331
01:31:16,533 --> 01:31:17,665
You want to hold

1332
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,230
your mommy's hand
with both hands?

1333
01:31:19,233 --> 01:31:20,633
Yeah!

1334
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:24,203
Very cute, very cute.

1335
01:31:26,133 --> 01:31:28,233
You should smile.

1336
01:31:28,268 --> 01:31:29,833
Right here!

1337
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:38,732
I need a second, guys.

1338
01:31:38,767 --> 01:31:40,927
You want to go get some
hot chocolate in the lobby?

1339
01:31:40,933 --> 01:31:41,598
- Okay.

1340
01:31:41,633 --> 01:31:43,232
Okay.

1341
01:31:43,267 --> 01:31:45,227
I'll come and get you.

1342
01:31:58,633 --> 01:32:00,203
What's this?

1343
01:32:00,533 --> 01:32:04,273
- It's a check to get your
car out of the impound lot.

1344
01:32:04,308 --> 01:32:06,067
- Oh.

1345
01:32:07,533 --> 01:32:09,373
- I'm really sorry.

1346
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:13,073
- It's okay.

1347
01:32:13,767 --> 01:32:18,767
- I also wanted to just
talk and explain a lot.

1348
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:23,200
- I think you did some
really good things for Eve.

1349
01:32:23,235 --> 01:32:25,331
- Well, I don't know about that.

1350
01:32:25,366 --> 01:32:27,427
- She really thinks
highly of you.

1351
01:32:27,433 --> 01:32:28,632
- I still made a mistake.

1352
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:32,267
I shouldn't have gone
behind your back.

1353
01:32:33,667 --> 01:32:35,227
- Yeah.

1354
01:32:36,433 --> 01:32:38,933
- I regret a lot of things.

1355
01:32:42,567 --> 01:32:44,427
- There's time to
make up for that.

1356
01:32:45,767 --> 01:32:48,427
- Yeah, great, okay.

1357
01:32:55,767 --> 01:32:57,067
- Eve, what
are you doing here?

1358
01:32:57,102 --> 01:32:58,032
- You've got to hide me.

1359
01:32:58,067 --> 01:32:59,067
- No, I'm not going to hide you.

1360
01:32:59,102 --> 01:33:00,767
I'm not gonna..

1361
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,300
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1362
01:33:03,335 --> 01:33:04,432
Stop, stop!

1363
01:33:04,467 --> 01:33:05,627
- I couldn't take
it in there anymore.

1364
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:08,032
I can't be shoved
in a box like that.

1365
01:33:08,067 --> 01:33:10,467
So I slipped through
the bars and got away.

1366
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:26,073
They let me out
on good behavior.

1367
01:33:26,108 --> 01:33:28,397
- Well that's not funny.

1368
01:33:28,767 --> 01:33:30,547
So how'd you get here?

1369
01:33:30,582 --> 01:33:32,327
My parents.

1370
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:33,832
- The adopted ones?

1371
01:33:33,867 --> 01:33:35,232
- I burnt their
house down and they still

1372
01:33:35,267 --> 01:33:40,097
took me back, so I guess
they're not as bad as I thought.

1373
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,500
- I'm sure by the time
you get to be a teenager,

1374
01:33:41,535 --> 01:33:43,300
they'll let you slide
with a lot of things.

1375
01:33:43,335 --> 01:33:47,101
That's really cool.

1376
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,832
So, what do you want?

1377
01:33:50,867 --> 01:33:53,227
- I left my bag in your car.

1378
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,470
- Eve, I got your...

1379
01:34:10,233 --> 01:34:11,603
Dave?

1380
01:34:11,733 --> 01:34:12,498
Hi.

1381
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:14,203
Hi.

1382
01:34:14,967 --> 01:34:15,797
Here's her bag.

1383
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,632
Thank you.

1384
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:19,267
- Yeah, no problem.

1385
01:34:19,533 --> 01:34:21,833
- For taking care of her.

1386
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,597
I don't blame her
for running away.

1387
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:29,670
She was just trying
to find her family.

1388
01:34:31,567 --> 01:34:36,327
- Yeah, I think she found it.

1389
01:37:25,067 --> 01:37:27,397
- Gary, behind me is
the burnt remains of an

1390
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,930
establishment many locals
knew as Ricky's pawn.

1391
01:37:30,933 --> 01:37:34,703
Police tell me that these
empty walls house hundreds of

1392
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:37,230
stolen goods from all
around the valley and also

1393
01:37:37,233 --> 01:37:40,633
operated as a store front
for illegal weapon sales.

1394
01:37:40,668 --> 01:37:43,132
I'm being told that the
evidence seized here

1395
01:37:43,167 --> 01:37:46,697
is also linked to another
investigation that could land

1396
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:50,930
this small pawn shop owner
behind bars for a very long time.

1397
01:37:50,933 --> 01:37:54,333
Reporting live,
Melissa Duran, 8 News.

1398
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,370
- Look like you could...

1399
01:38:50,533 --> 01:38:52,073
Maybe could use some help, huh?

1400
01:38:52,108 --> 01:38:53,232
- Yeah!

1401
01:38:53,267 --> 01:38:55,067
I could use some
help from a cop.

1402
01:38:55,102 --> 01:38:56,927
Love cops.

1403
01:38:59,067 --> 01:39:00,497
- Thank you.

1404
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:05,370
So you're just throwing
it in the back, huh?

1405
01:39:05,405 --> 01:39:07,001
- Yeah, you just...

1406
01:39:07,036 --> 01:39:08,597
It's just stuff.
