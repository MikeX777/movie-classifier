1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,760
Hurry up.

2
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,120
So many unbearable pains
for our children!

3
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,280
- Dielika.
- Yes.

4
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,280
Let's go home. You go first.

5
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,880
School is over for you.

6
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:57,519
Lessons from the garbage

7
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
Help me.

8
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,880
No way. Did you help me?

9
00:04:11,832 --> 00:04:13,120
Bala, where is my mother?

10
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,120
You uncircumcised,
where is your 'Hello'?

11
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,720
Your mother is at the market.

12
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,760
Are you crying?

13
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,160
You're supposed to be
at school, aren't you?

14
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,880
We've been expelled.

15
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,022
Already? They were quick this year.

16
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,223
What are you doing here?

17
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Those who don't have a bench
have been expelled.

18
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,200
God!

19
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,480
Bring me a mug.

20
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,080
Take care of your sister.

21
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
- Bala.
- Yes.

22
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,600
I'm going to the school.

23
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,480
Come along!

24
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,800
- And Fanta?
- I haven't seen her.

25
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,200
Don't bother me today.

26
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,800
It's here.

27
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,362
Hello.

28
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
Teacher, why did you expel him?

29
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
It's not me. It's the rules.

30
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
What shall I do?

31
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,640
Look, they all have their bench.

32
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,640
My son can sit on the floor.

33
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,720
Impossible!

34
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,320
- What can I do?
- Find him a bench.

35
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,480
Shut up!

36
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm begging you...

37
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,040
My son can sit on the floor.

38
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960
Impossible. There may be an inspection.

39
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
He would be expelled and
I would be sanctioned.

40
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,520
God, what can I do?

41
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,643
Find a bench.
Anything to sit on.

42
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,480
So many unbearable pains
for our children!

43
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,400
You mustn't accept such things.

44
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,480
Our children will be ignorant,
like us.

45
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,400
It's so unfair.

46
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,160
Come on, let's go.

47
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,240
Oh! You're not studying.

48
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,280
I need money.

49
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Again! I gave you
3500 FM last year.

50
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,400
- It's annual.
- Sort it out yourself.

51
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,280
Bengali, how many times
did you eat the day before yesterday?

52
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,680
- Once.
- And yesterday?

53
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,800
Once. Without meat.

54
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
Today, there is nothing!

55
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,880
I want to go to school.

56
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,960
I won't keep you.
Good riddance.

57
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,880
The director forbid us...

58
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
any physical appearance.

59
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,960
Did he? Does he own the country?

60
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,160
Is he a colonel?

61
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,640
He's not a soldier
but he is hurtful.

62
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
Does he wipe his ass with an ax?

63
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,840
What? Son of a bitch!

64
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Laugh at your misfortune,
son of a bitch.

65
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,720
Father, you're insulting yourself.
What about the school??

66
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,480
You'll be expelled sooner or later.

67
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,680
Even stuffed with diplomas
you will be jobless.

68
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,720
They can keep their school.

69
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,080
We'll keep our meager resources.

70
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
Also, the Franc CFA is back...

71
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,200
we'll tear each other apart.

72
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,600
Kalifa, why didn't
you wait for me?

73
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
I've been expelled.

74
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,484
Enough! Fanta, wash the mug.

75
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,840
Mother, did you buy oranges?

76
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,242
Yes. Hurry up.

77
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,004
Hello! Saran, are you done?

78
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,080
Yes.

79
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,280
Mom, I'm hungry.

80
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,480
- Have you started?
- I don't know.

81
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,280
I've been expelled because
I have no bench.

82
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,320
We have everything:
benches, notebooks, books...

83
00:12:57,784 --> 00:13:00,200
Everything is brand new...
Look at my bag-pack.

84
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Of course. Your school
is the one of the rich.

85
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,040
Let's go home.

86
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,960
Bring some water.

87
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,520
Children, how
are your studies going?

88
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,640
Is it ok at school?

89
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,400
Finish your meal.

90
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,280
You may be disgusted.

91
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,640
I am already. You
shouldn't have told that.

92
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,040
Eat it anyway.

93
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
Explain yourselves now.

94
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,840
We are poor and once
again victims.

95
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,000
- Kalifa has been expelled.
- God!

96
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,120
There is only misfortune
for us.

97
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,040
They want us dead.

98
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:46,480
It won't be.

99
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,220
We're not the only ones
in this situation.

100
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,200
What can we do?

101
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,080
Don't give them the
pleasure to see us...

102
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,960
crying, our children
will go to school.

103
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,000
But how? We have nothing...

104
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,040
and you barely earn a living.

105
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,480
Sure.

106
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,680
Here, there are 500 FM.

107
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,960
No, mother, keep it.

108
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
We now have 500 FM,
I'll borrow...

109
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,800
- Again!
- We have to.

110
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,080
I'll give half my wage.

111
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:52,440
- So many?
- It's only 12.000 FM.

112
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
And we'll also rent
a cart for Kalifa.

113
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,880
He'll work like his sister.

114
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,840
Can he? It's very tiring.

115
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,000
It's also the learning
process of life.

116
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,120
Mother, can we go?

117
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,480
It's over Mom. Dry your tears.

118
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,400
You're so ugly when you cry.

119
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,240
Get out, duffer.

120
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,560
Are you crying?

121
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
Maybe we should all die?

122
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,560
Shut up, crybaby.

123
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,680
Hello Saran.

124
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,120
I come for the ember.

125
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,840
FounÃ©, you should stop
being a servant.

126
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,304
Impossible. I must continue.

127
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,720
Hello, father.

128
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,240
- How are you doing at school?
- The bench is too heavy.

129
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,480
I'll lighten it this evening.

130
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,600
Go meet your mother.

131
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,160
- Father's coming.
- How lucky he is!

132
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,360
It's not in this way everyday.

133
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,880
He works at Bamako,
this is far away.

134
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,640
Mother, what are you saying?
We live in Bamako.

135
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,240
Don't bother me,
everyone say so!

136
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,640
Let's hurry.

137
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,560
I can't go faster.

138
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,400
Let's have a break.
It's too hot.

139
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,880
You made fun of me.

140
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,200
You'll suffer at work.

141
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,600
I am a man.
The work will be easy.

142
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,880
- What a blusterer.
- Leave him alone.

143
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,480
He can't even drive the cart.

144
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,960
Yes. It's an old one.

145
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,560
I'll insure you regular studies.

146
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Because I am playing?

147
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,440
If it doesn't work here,
I'll go to the city.

148
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Be back before twilight.

149
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,640
Oranges! Buy oranges!

150
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm going.

151
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,720
Wait. Take the garbage with you.

152
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,440
- It will be 150 FM.
- What? Make it 50 FM.

153
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,080
- It's not enough. 100 FM.
- Let's say 75 FM.

154
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,770
Ok. But I'm doing you a favor.

155
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,240
- Where is your license?
- He's new.

156
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,800
Are you working full-time?

157
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
No, I study every morning.

158
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,520
Oh! You'll end up like us.
No more school.

159
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,280
Driver, start the engine.

160
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,003
You, you bought your license. Bye!

161
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,234
Is there any garbage?

162
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:28,240
Yes, over here.

163
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,760
- How much?
- 150 FM.

164
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,240
No. 50 FM.

165
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,840
Damn! Do you want it free?

166
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,360
- Forget it.
- 100 FM.

167
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,680
Don't call us carrier anymore.

168
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,800
I'll do it again tomorrow.

169
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,480
- I'm exhausted.
- It's just the beginning.

170
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,240
Massage me, please.

171
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,400
I'd rather swallow you.

172
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,400
Stop your impudence.

173
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,080
Bala, this is the boss' food.

174
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,280
Get up, let's go.

175
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,320
Eh! Kalifa, don't make a fool of us.

176
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,555
Saran, you should appoint her somebody.

177
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
Father, I have to go.

178
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,040
My friend is waiting for
me to work.

179
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,600
Fill up the bucket.

180
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,760
Your mother must be tired.

181
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,360
Why can't she have a day off?

182
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,440
Servants have no rights.

183
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:23,600
They are at their boss' mercy.

184
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,600
Can't it change?

185
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,360
It'll change.

186
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,800
When? I don't know.

187
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,560
This kid is talking too much
instead of working.

188
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,680
You want to speak to me.
You'll have to wait.

189
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,160
Hey, old hag! Are you coming?

190
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,200
Rascal, I'll beat you up.

191
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,800
Push it, bloke.

192
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,960
What is it?

193
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,880
"Old woman", is there garbage?

194
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,000
Call me so again and I'll knock you out.

195
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,080
What should I call you?

196
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,560
Aren't you Barou's mother?

197
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,840
No, his mother is my big sister.

198
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,960
- So, mother...
- Get out, Satan's son...

199
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,360
Buzz off!

200
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,800
What's wrong with all these
30-year-old women?

201
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,040
Is it her age?

202
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,320
Buddy, do you know one of them...

203
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,913
who accepts to be called "old lady"?

204
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,600
Let's have a little break.

205
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,520
Bloke, your sex is going outside.

206
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,040
Shit!

207
00:30:57,345 --> 00:31:00,040
You're not wearing pants!

208
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,318
Are you crazy?
I have no short...

209
00:31:02,438 --> 00:31:04,080
and you want me to wear pants.

210
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,160
Pants twist penis anyway.

211
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,320
You don't wear pants neither.

212
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,160
I'll rip your ass off!

213
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,200
You small ass!

214
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,400
Bloke, look at this ass!

215
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,400
This girl's boyfriend is so lucky!

216
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,760
Hey, sweety, come here.

217
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,200
- Me?
- Yes.

218
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,280
- What is it?
- I like you.

219
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,960
- What do you mean?
- I want you.

220
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,000
Let's get laid.

221
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,920
Are you a junkie?

222
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,680
For you, I'll be the fresh
corn from Sahel.

223
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,520
Not like this little whore.

224
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
Calm down.

225
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,320
Am I your little whore?

226
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,320
Sure! You made us...

227
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,840
whore for new rich.

228
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,920
Insult me again, I'll beat you.

229
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,000
You'll both be beaten...

230
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,640
if his wife catch you.

231
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,120
He fled. He abandoned you.

232
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,240
Impossible. Man, you're out of your depth!

233
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,040
The village coward has fled.

234
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,160
It's the "old lady" 's husband.

235
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
May God give us wisdom.

236
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,880
If the youngest find out about this,
I'll be rotten.

237
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Barou, come here.

238
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,040
Why are you calling me?

239
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,640
Is your mother the "old
lady" of this house?

240
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,040
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

241
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,960
She's very black.

242
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,720
She's the only "old lady".

243
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,000
She says you are not her son.

244
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,160
- Mom was joking.
- Not at all.

245
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,137
She says you're her nephew.

246
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,606
- She said that?
- Yeah.

247
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,640
My word! If my mother
do this to me...

248
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,480
I'll disown her!

249
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,560
What a beautiful hairstyle Mom.

250
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,680
It's pretty, isn't it. Be careful.

251
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,840
- How elegant is Mom.
- What do you mean?

252
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,000
- Sorry, I didn't say anything.
- You'd better.

253
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,240
Mom, you're telling
I'm not your son.

254
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,520
God! Why would I do that?

255
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Some boys told me.

256
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,520
These bastards.

257
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,680
- Get up.
- What a story.

258
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,120
Children today are mean.

259
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,520
Making an enemy of my dear child.

260
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,520
You two, are you done?

261
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,440
Here is the coward.
Come with me.

262
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,960
Let's work.

263
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,720
I must bring 200 FM home.

264
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,840
Come with me. You won't regret it.

265
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,523
Climb up!

266
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,040
Mom only loves Barou.

267
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,240
- Him and his big head.
- Leave me alone.

268
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,320
I love you all.
He has his dad's head.

269
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,400
Look.

270
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,560
Go play somewhere else.
I'm ill.

271
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,320
Mom, did you hear Dad's car?

272
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,480
I'll beat you up, idiot.

273
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,880
It hurts all over. Go away!

274
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,320
Sali! I'm calling you
and you don't answer?

275
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,760
I heard, but I'm sick.

276
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,680
What is it again?

277
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,840
My fingers hurt, my head, all over.

278
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:02,126
This finger? You have fever.

279
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,560
Calm down, little sister.

280
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,240
I'll go buy medicine.

281
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,440
Look, she's not ill anymore.

282
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,440
Impossible.

283
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,800
- Here Mom.
- What is it, this fish?

284
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,920
- It's a captain.
- Well!

285
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,040
Will you have some?

286
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,560
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing.

287
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,120
What a moron.
Laughing for nothing.

288
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:46,160
Prepare us a little treat.

289
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,120
Mom, are you healed already?

290
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,160
Stop your impudence.
Come closer, my love.

291
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,400
Dear, put some music on.

292
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,920
Where is Barou?

293
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,240
Forget him and his big head.

294
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,640
If he hears you, he'll be mad.

295
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,760
I can't believe it. I'm dead.

296
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,880
See, I told you.

297
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,000
May God protect me from such a mother!

298
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,840
Still, you do have a mother...

299
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,960
May He protect you from such a woman...

300
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,080
faking and refusing to age.

301
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,600
There is only oddity from the rich.

302
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,320
Like those stupid nicknames
: Dolly Bird, Sweety...

303
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,520
You're right. Barou and his big balls...

304
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,798
is called Sweetheart.

305
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:28,177
Important dates in Mali's history are...

306
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,386
22 September 1960...

307
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:34,820
Political independence of Mali.

308
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:40,101
20 January 1962...

309
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:42,808
After the French troops leave...

310
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:47,084
creation of the... national army.

311
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:51,474
2 June 1962...

312
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:54,098
creation of Malian's Front.

313
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:56,819
19 November 1968...

314
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,400
- Get up and go home.
- Leave me alone.

315
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,440
Come on! Get up.

316
00:41:09,424 --> 00:41:13,166
Important dates in Mali's history are...

317
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:15,741
22 September 1960...

318
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:18,981
Political independence of Mali.

319
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,480
- Grand-Mother, rub me.
- Stop bothering me.

320
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,680
You've only worked for 4 months.

321
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,400
Fuck you!

322
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,480
Father, I can't study anymore.

323
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,120
I'm second to last amongst 75 students.

324
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,400
You'll rest one afternoon per week.

325
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:53,722
What about me?

326
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,560
Shut up. Your work is easy.

327
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,240
Fucking bastard.

328
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,920
Enough. She's working hard too.

329
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,760
She's walking kilometers to sell oranges.

330
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,360
She's just sitting in a corner,
nothing else.

331
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,960
No, I'm lying down.

332
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,800
His rest will be a shortage...

333
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,440
we'll lose 1600 FM.

334
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,440
Damn it! You, you're only eating.

335
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,360
Sleeping or talking bullshit.

336
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,520
Give us a break.
Mother is right.

337
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,000
Yes, but let them rest.

338
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,880
You slackers!

339
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:42,046
Me? I'm feeding you
and you won't even rub me.

340
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,640
You're a coward in this village.

341
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,960
Well! Honey, rub me.

342
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,480
I refuse.

343
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,640
So I don't love you anymore.
Let's divorce.

344
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,040
My mouth is tearing up from laughter...

345
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,800
but there's no blood.

346
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,920
Go to bed. Everybody will rest tomorrow.

347
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,200
Look at those children.

348
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,720
They are from poor families,
like you.

349
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,880
They don't go to school anymore.
This is their lives.

350
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,000
These are peasant like me.

351
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,760
They have emigrated from the countryside.

352
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,960
Selfishness has defeated them...

353
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,360
Them and their lands.

354
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,760
Our society has become a jungle.

355
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,880
We have to fight for our lives.

356
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:27,400
Waiter! That son of a bitch
fired me.

357
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,920
Pour me a quick shot.
I'm going to beat my wife.

358
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,080
- What has she done?
- It's none of your business.

359
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,280
An arab proverb says:

360
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,560
"Beat your wife everyday."

361
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,626
"If you don't know why, she does."

362
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,920
Bullshit!

363
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,800
You're a bastard with your fucking face.

364
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,880
Pour me one!

365
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,600
I only sell coffee.

366
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,720
Coffee? I'm damned.

367
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,640
Like a monkey's ass!

368
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,880
Chaka, you think I didn't see you?

369
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,600
You're getting drunk with your son?

370
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,680
Your boss is the
son of a bitch.

371
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,600
Say it to him for me.

372
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,760
Me, Bala, I say this to you all:
"Sons of bitches."

373
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,320
Son of a bitch.

374
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,640
They will become beggars...

375
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,080
What about us?
What do you think?

376
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,480
We are tired and we need books...

377
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,640
My sister and I are going to be expelled.

378
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:19,660
What will you do if you're expelled?

379
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,800
- I'll be a driver.
- Like your father.

380
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,440
Yeah, look!

381
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,560
I'm a good driver, aren't I?

382
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,080
Yeah! I'll be a director so I can hire you.

383
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,840
My ass! Directors are thieves.

384
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,800
Then I'll be a cop to arrest them.

385
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,280
An extorting cop?

386
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,720
You're not safe man!

387
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,117
Here is Fanta.

388
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:04,520
What is it?

389
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,440
Some boys took my oranges.

390
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,560
Go tell Mom. I have to work.

391
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:17,680
- Let's beat them up.
- They are far away.

392
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,720
Shut up! Who can you beat up?

393
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,640
I can't beat nobody up?

394
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,560
So I'm a puppet now.

395
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,840
Even worse. You're like a ball.

396
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,440
Have you seen the puppet?

397
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,840
The King of the Puppets.

398
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,600
Stop it or I'll kick your ass.

399
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,760
What? Can't we dance anymore?

400
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,000
Forget it!

401
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,800
Kalifa, your mother is calling you.

402
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,640
Tell her you didn't see me.

403
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,360
I won't play this game.

404
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,360
Go ahead! I'll follow you.

405
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,200
Give me the fire. I'll blow it.

406
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,440
How much did we earn?

407
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,240
350 FM less 150 for the cart.

408
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,760
I told you to be back before twilight.

409
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,080
But I was here!

410
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:31,240
Stop playing dumb.

411
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,760
Take the money.

412
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,320
You haven't been listening to me recently.

413
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,640
Go on. I'll mutilate you soon.

414
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,465
What did I do wrong?

415
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,720
Kalifa, we are working hard for you.

416
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,560
Have mercy!

417
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,720
I'll talk to his father.

418
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,760
Good night.

419
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,840
Do something.

420
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,560
Kalifa is on the road to ruin.

421
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,160
I'm leaving.

422
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,080
Good for nothing!
If I catch you...

423
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,040
Chaka! Leave my grand-son in peace.

424
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,080
Mother, you know we are
working hard for our kids.

425
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,880
Shut up!

426
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,000
Why haven't you brought
diner yet?

427
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,080
Where is Mother?

428
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,200
FounÃ© is having birth pangs.

429
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,760
Mother!

430
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,920
I heard. I said so.

431
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,520
Saran, go with them.

432
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,520
My friend, did you sleep well?

433
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:16,773
Leave me alone,
you and your fucking face!

434
00:56:16,893 --> 00:56:18,361
I'm sorry sir.

435
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,400
You can't even speak French.

436
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,600
Where is your father?

437
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,399
They want to bring her to the hospital.

438
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:30,120
But no car will stop to take her.

439
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,920
What?

440
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,120
Are you okay?

441
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,160
None of these bastards will stop.

442
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:53,360
Three people to the hospital.

443
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,920
Do you have 2000 FM?

444
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,800
Are you crazy? It's 975 FM.

445
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,960
Go find another one then.

446
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,920
Lean against me.
It's gonna be okay.

447
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,076
FounÃ©.

448
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,120
Big brother, I can't stand it.

449
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,720
I'll get my bike.

450
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,000
Kids, it's reckless.

451
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,897
Let's look for a car.

452
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:28,240
We can't wait.

453
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,680
She's suffering too much.
She may give birth here.

454
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,640
Make a strong knot.

455
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Go ahead.
Mother is following you.

456
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,960
Bakari, look back frequently.

457
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:28,040
It's gonna be fine.
Grab onto me.

458
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,120
Do you want me to have problems?

459
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,242
But she is pregnant.
Are you mad?

460
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:52,920
Why don't you go by car?

461
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,080
Help me.

462
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:03,040
Doctor, the pregnant woman
is suffering too much!

463
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,080
What can we do?

464
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,520
I'm dying.

465
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,200
Have you seen my bike?

466
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,280
It was here.
It's not here anymore.

467
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,547
Here is the prescription.
22 500 FM of medicines.

468
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,200
We can't see her without it.

469
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,200
- Has she given birth yet?
- I don't know.

470
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,040
- Eat
- I'm not hungry.

471
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:45,080
Calm down and it.
Mother is with her.

472
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:50,240
Help me! My money is not enough.

473
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,400
Calm down!

474
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,520
Saran, how much is left?

475
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,200
5000 FM. 2000 FM for school.

476
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:08,320
Give everything to Bakari.

477
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:17,480
- What about the children?
- They can wait.

478
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,920
Wait for me. We'll try
to borrow the rest.

479
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,780
Father, what about us?

480
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,480
You'll expelled from school.

481
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,960
Stay here and help us.

482
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,920
You're happy, aren't you?
But I want to study.

483
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:55,040
Become a director
and help our parents.

484
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,680
It's your problem.

485
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,720
Can't you see we won't be anything.

486
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:07,233
You'll be like mother
I'll be like father.

487
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,640
What's gotten into you?

488
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,320
My brother and I want to study.

489
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:25,261
- Make her silent!
- Make her silent yourself!

490
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,360
Do you want to see me dead?

491
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,440
Some people want to see you dead.

492
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,480
Open your eyes!

493
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,640
Get lost, yeah!

494
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:48,760
Father, don't get mad to mother.

495
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:54,020
So shut up and eat.

496
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,320
My brother and me want to be educated...

497
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,400
understand the world.

498
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,680
Father, why do some people have everything?

499
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,400
And some others nothing?

500
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,280
The world is changing
Don't worry.

501
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,040
Your mother and I are here.

502
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,520
What will become of us when
you're not here anymore?

503
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,800
Shut up and eat.

504
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,240
Shut up now.

505
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,320
You'll find a husband
who'll take care of you.

506
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,399
Fuck. I'll study.

507
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
No husband
will make my life a misery.

508
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,600
Stop that bullshit,
we have to go.

509
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:30,760
School should be free.

510
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,600
Shall we kill our children.

511
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:37,160
They have no food,
no clothes, no school.

512
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,080
Where has our money gone?

513
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,080
Where? We're eating it!

514
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,760
As well as your salary and the taxes.

515
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,360
Beat it now!

516
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,480
Now you're insulting me!

517
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,440
Are you crazy or do you want to go to jail?

518
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,960
It wouldn't be worse.

519
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,080
What can I do in this rotten world?

520
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,240
Hang me at your balls.

521
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,680
Poor mustn't be vindictive.

522
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,880
Arse-licker words!
A submissive poor,

523
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,160
is like a sheep in an abattoir.

524
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,640
I won't be somebody's sheep!

525
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,800
- Buy oranges!
- Vendor, here.

526
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,640
- How much?
- 25 FM.

527
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,440
Come here.

528
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:44,480
Mate, watch out for the tea.
Come closer.

529
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,840
You're cute. In 2 years
we'll take care of you.

530
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,680
Let go of me!

531
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,880
Aren't you ashamed to hit on a little girl!

532
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,160
What you do in your truck is even worse.

533
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,800
It's not true!

534
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,406
Stop it.
We know everything about it.

535
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:22,600
Can't you see we won't be anything.

536
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:27,640
You'll be like mother
I'll be like father.

537
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,920
Who is it?

538
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,400
Stop or I'll insult your mother.

539
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,560
Pointless, you don't love her.

540
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,920
It's you Karim. You'll hurt me.

541
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,040
Come on, we have to work.

542
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,440
So kid!

543
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,720
Your father is a kid.

544
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,840
- Let go of me!
- What's the matter?

545
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,960
My father beat me up yesterday
and I worked this morning.

546
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,320
Your father is puny,
his punches must be soft.

547
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,760
Fuck you! I'm serious.

548
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,920
This morning I've been
looking for you at school.

549
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,440
Without the 1000 FM
we would have been expelled.

550
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,640
My father borrowed again.

551
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,480
Let's go!

552
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,916
I beg for charity in Allah's name!

553
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,200
This is our "old lady" 's house.

554
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,960
- Shall we try?
- We're gonna be insulted.

555
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:46,240
Let me do it.
I understand women.

556
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,280
A big girl like you!

557
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,320
I forbid you to call me Mom in public.

558
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,800
What should I call you?

559
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,560
Don't call me!

560
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,080
What a story!

561
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,040
What is it?

562
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,480
Big sister! Where is the garbage?

563
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,840
Little brother.
May Allah bless you!

564
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:09,000
Here, 100 FM.

565
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,240
"Big sister! Where is the garbage?"

566
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,600
"Little brother,
may Allah bless you!"

567
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,680
What an old hag!

568
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,200
So Barou becomes our nephew.

569
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,599
Let's call him "sonny boy", like the rich.

570
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,840
I'm hungry. Let's buy food.

571
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,800
- Haven't you have diner already?
- I have.

572
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,880
I give it to my aunt at the hospital.

573
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,560
Also, I'm never sated.

574
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:05,680
Wait, can we eat for free?

575
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:12,120
Are you crazy?
It's no time to beg.

576
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,440
You saw the dresser. Come.

577
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,720
Kids, come here.

578
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,080
Give it to me.

579
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,400
Here, candies.

580
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,120
Is this your food?
It's begging!

581
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:23,560
Patience, mate.

582
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,120
What an asshole!
We could have taken everything.

583
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,440
- Where did you learn this?
- From Segou.

584
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,880
It's great.
But I'm still hungry.

585
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,320
- You're insatiable.
- Let's do it again.

586
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,440
Watch out, the boy want to beat us up.

587
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,280
Hello.

588
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:36,040
Come here. Give me a feather.

589
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,560
What a jerk!

590
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,800
I'm replete and ready to work.

591
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,960
Son of a glutton!

592
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,400
See, youngs and olds both are vicious.

593
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:29,640
Yes. But the feather is a terrible weapon.

594
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,000
Listen to this story:

595
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,000
A woman go to the market
with a feather in the ear.

596
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,800
In ecstasy, she walks past and enter...

597
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,320
in a police station.

598
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,800
Stopped by a table, she says:

599
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,960
"Butcher, give me good meat this time."

600
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,320
The police chief answer
: "This if my foot."

601
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:02,760
"It will kick your ass."

602
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,840
You're going to kill me
with your lies.

603
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,920
My father told me this story.

604
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,280
According to Djeli Baba...

605
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,513
the biggest liar around.

606
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:14,480
Djeli Baba doesn't lie.
He his a storyteller.

607
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,840
Listen.

608
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,480
- Tell your story.
- Which one?

609
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:30,640
The pisser doesn't feel comfortable
when it comes to fart.

610
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,680
Listen Kalifa KonÃ©,
brave amongst the braves:

611
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,800
Three people don't like to be greeted.

612
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,000
They are: the one who is taking a dump,
the one who is making a move on...

613
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,760
and the one who is stealing.

614
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,360
Shit! We forgot the woman.

615
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,080
God!

616
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,240
Mother is calling you.
We're going home.

617
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,120
- Already? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

618
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,520
Here, 125 FM. Buy me 1 kg of millet.

619
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,240
Don't cry, think about Allah!

620
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:20,480
- And Bakary?
- He's gone mad.

621
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:26,080
He is insulting the administration.

622
01:19:26,738 --> 01:19:29,560
We should have controlled
him back in the cemetery.

623
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,720
He shouldn't insult anybody,
it's God's will.

624
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,760
FounÃ© gave birth in blood and pain.

625
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,403
Mother, she gave birth at 8:00am.

626
01:19:46,523 --> 01:19:48,560
She waited until 2:00pm for care.

627
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,280
When Bakari brought the medicines.

628
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,840
She died at 4:00pm in pain.

629
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:58,320
Without you, the child
wouldn't have been washed.

630
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,440
Yes, it was atrocious.

631
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:07,600
Bakari broke doors and windows at the end.

632
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,640
I'm afraid he'll be arrested.

633
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,120
These cowards won't do this.

634
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:18,280
They know it's a murder.

635
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,840
Saran, calm down.
Cook something for Bakari.

636
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:39,080
Saran, pray Allah!
It's His will.

637
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:04,560
Ghaka, we need milk for the baby.

638
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:09,600
I know. We have to borrow again.

639
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,040
Our misfortune is escalating.

640
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,160
Poor children.

641
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:19,194
Don't talk like that.
Have faith in God.

642
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,440
Why? With our credit note...

643
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,320
school and medical cares need to be free.

644
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,039
What can these crushed children know?

645
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,680
Apart from tiredness and deprivation.

646
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,600
Father, I don't want to stop studying.

647
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,960
My daughter, I don't want it neither.

648
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:07,400
- What's wrong?
- We've been turned down.

649
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:13,200
Sit down. I understand.

650
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,280
This is the result of our way of living.

651
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,360
School is over.
Are you graduating?

652
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,640
No. Leave me alone!

653
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,560
I'm graduating, my sister too.

654
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,760
Our parents promised us presents.

655
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,240
You'll be like mother
I'll be like father.

656
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,840
Buy ice-creams.

657
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:03,486
Come here, I'll take you to school.

658
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,960
Will you pick me up when I get out?

659
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:01,022
- This is too much.
- Please, man.

660
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:05,162
But I have to work!

661
01:25:18,533 --> 01:25:20,774
Tomorrow, she'll ask
for money for her hair.

662
01:25:21,131 --> 01:25:23,777
Young lady, you are lost.

663
01:26:05,403 --> 01:26:07,302
Chaka, I agreed...

664
01:26:07,422 --> 01:26:09,867
you'll go to the city.

665
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,859
Don't forget me and your mother.
Have a good trip.

666
01:26:39,834 --> 01:26:44,785
Kalifa, what did you do?

667
01:26:46,466 --> 01:26:51,287
Get your ass up. Kalifa KonÃ©!

668
01:26:56,758 --> 01:27:00,330
Did you touch my cards?

669
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:02,310
Kalifa, what did you do?

670
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:06,759
Nothing mother.
I was hungry and I stole.

671
01:27:06,879 --> 01:27:10,801
Don't cry mother.

672
01:27:17,645 --> 01:27:21,021
Fanta, where are you?

673
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:38,626
Fanta, what are you doing here?

674
01:27:38,919 --> 01:27:42,182
Mother, let me earn some money.

675
01:27:42,442 --> 01:27:44,292
I can't stand it anymore.

676
01:27:44,412 --> 01:27:46,451
Mother, don't cry.

677
01:27:50,746 --> 01:27:52,645
Saran, what's going on?

678
01:27:52,765 --> 01:27:57,775
- Where are the children?
- They are here, outside.

679
01:28:01,931 --> 01:28:03,554
Mother, go to bed.

680
01:28:03,674 --> 01:28:05,509
You're ill.

681
01:28:05,629 --> 01:28:09,080
We have to go to work.

682
01:28:33,481 --> 01:28:35,591
Father, mother is ill.

683
01:28:35,711 --> 01:28:39,179
She can stay here and take
care of the two babies.

684
01:28:39,299 --> 01:28:42,799
We'll go to work.

685
01:28:42,919 --> 01:28:46,054
Good bye Father.

686
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:59,521
We should have been stillborn.

687
01:28:59,641 --> 01:29:04,440
<i>Do you know why I'm crying?</i>

688
01:29:06,835 --> 01:29:11,899
<i>I'm crying for several reasons.</i>
