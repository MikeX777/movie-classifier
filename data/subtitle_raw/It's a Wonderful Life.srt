00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:28,874
IT'S AWONDERFUL LIFE

2
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,291
My God, today is the 16th day of the 12th moon

3
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,582
Try my carrot cake.

4
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:39,166
Everyone has a dream.

5
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,332
Please bless my family.

6
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:45,124
Please bless my son, Kau Fu and his wife.

7
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,332
So that they will live happily together again.

8
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,291
No more argues.

9
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:51,499
I've not see my grand-daughter for a lone time.

10
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:01,249
Please bless my second son, Kau Kwai.

11
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:02,666
To have a sharp tongue!

12
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,791
And, not to quarrel with his dad anymore.

13
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:08,291
Bless my youngest son, Kau Kei,
make him a good boy.

14
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,207
And, bless my daughter,
Kau Ann return from France.

15
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,499
And let her settle in Hong Kong!

16
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:24,082
My God, my wish is so simple.

17
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:25,624
I hope all members
of my family will gather together.

18
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:29,499
To have a family union dinner,
if so, I will be so...

19
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:35,624
Father-in-law!

20
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,499
Are you alright!

21
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:40,249
Are you alright!

22
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:42,291
Where is the toothpick?

23
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,416
Did you eat it?

24
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:51,666
He swallow the toothpick in his throat.

25
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:52,916
Be quick! Be quick!

26
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,082
What a trouble!

27
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:57,249
Grand-dad has swallowed a toothpick.

28
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,707
Go and get your dad now.

29
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:05,291
Quick! Kau Kwai! Open the door!

30
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:09,166
What a big trouble!

31
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,416
Open the door.

32
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,374
What the hell is it?

33
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:22,374
Your dad has swallowed a toothpick!

34
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,082
Good post!

35
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:32,916
How dare you fool me!

36
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,666
You'd turn 360 degree.

37
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:42,499
Shut up!

38
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,707
Don't scare me! How are you now?

39
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,541
How are you now?

40
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,249
What's the matter!

41
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:48,957
What's the matter!

42
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:51,124
Ask your brother to help, go.

43
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,207
Call the ambulance now.

44
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:53,582
Yes.

45
00:04:54,332 --> 00:04:57,499
Dad, why are you so clumsy!

46
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,832
Brother didn't answer me.

47
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,874
That bastart! I'll teach him a lesson.

48
00:05:01,874 --> 00:05:03,291
Grand-dad is conscious now.

49
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,124
Dad.

50
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:11,916
Did you over-cook the rice?

51
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:14,249
You scared us.

52
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:17,874
But you shouldn't over cook the rice!

53
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,749
Dad, are you alright?

54
00:05:20,749 --> 00:05:22,791
Don't call the ambulance.

55
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,541
I did!

56
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,124
I've just called Kau Fu.

57
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,624
But his mobile phone is always engaged.

58
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:31,041
You are all bastards!

59
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,207
Your grandsons!

60
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,457
Are all weird!

61
00:05:33,457 --> 00:05:35,374
Dad, how wise are you.

62
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:38,457
How can you put all the blames on your dad?

63
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:40,332
Help!

64
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,249
Why don't you blame your own sperm?

65
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:44,499
They were good sperm!

66
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:47,457
What do you want to eat?

67
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,999
Sign it!

68
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,707
Come here please.

69
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,041
I will give you 400% raise.

70
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:00,957
Really? Boss.

71
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:01,999
Right!

72
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,707
That's the smile I want.

73
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,624
Do you understand?

74
00:06:06,624 --> 00:06:08,291
We are serving people.

75
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,624
We should give them a smiling face.

76
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:12,832
Be cheerful!

77
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,874
You know, Japan can be so strong.

78
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,582
Because the Japanses women smiles 24 hours.

79
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:20,832
And bow with courtesy.

80
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,916
Let me demonstrate once.

81
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,166
They are your bosses.

82
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,207
Thank you, welcome

83
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,624
Why are you here?

84
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:33,916
I just want to chat with you!

85
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,541
You are not welcomed here, go now!

86
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:37,166
You open the shop, so I can come in.

87
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,207
If you don't serve me!
I will go to Consumer Council for a complaint.

88
00:06:42,374 --> 00:06:43,457
How can she do that?

89
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:44,499
What do you want to eat?

90
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:46,124
I want to see my daughter!

91
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:47,666
It's not on the menu!

92
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,124
I really miss her.

93
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:50,291
Can you let me see her?

94
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,749
The court did forbid you to see her.

95
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:53,624
Please forget it!

96
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:54,999
You are too tough!

97
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,832
I can do something tougher!

98
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,457
Wait!

99
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:01,582
Hold it, or I will sue you
of indecent assaulting me.

100
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,624
You are too nasty.

101
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:04,832
You nasty woman!

102
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:05,666
How dare you scold me!

103
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:09,291
How dare you scold me!

104
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:12,791
Ladies and gentlemen,

105
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,124
See how they treat the customers!

106
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:16,832
Stop eating? It's poisonous.

107
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:20,291
See how bad is that man.

108
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:21,374
"Ichiban" Very good.

109
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,582
Your shirt is dirtied?

110
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:27,999
What's wrong?

111
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,249
Have eaten yet?

112
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,624
Let me cook a noodle for you, come on.

113
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,624
Come, let me toast to you.

114
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:42,957
I can't make it, I can't

115
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:44,999
Come on! Cheers!

116
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:47,416
Come on, I won't sign
the contract with you if not drink.

117
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,124
Come on, let's drink together.

118
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:50,999
Come...

119
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,207

120
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,916
Drink with me!

121
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:00,624
Come...

122
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:02,291
- Drink.

123
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,957
Good!

124
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:05,291
Drink with me

125
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,832
Right, drink with us, one by one.

126
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:13,749
Drink...

127
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:17,499
How are you?

128
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,666
Go and fix the contract.

129
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,207
I'd contribute something to show daddy.

130
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,832
Come...

131
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,332
Show time.

132
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:29,499
Bravo!

133
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,332
Good drinker.

134
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,124
Come...I'll sign

135
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,291
He signed.

136
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,124
Kau Fu.

137
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:47,666
Sign...sign.

138
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:49,999
Kau Fu.

139
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:53,499
Are you alright?

140
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,332
Daddy, you are drunk again.

141
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,832
Come on hurry up.

142
00:08:58,832 --> 00:08:59,957
Hide up!

143
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,249
Come on, be good,

144
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,791
hide under the bed.

145
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:12,332
Have you signed the contract, is it a billion?

146
00:09:12,457 --> 00:09:14,041
What?

147
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,416
Isn't the amount 8 million?

148
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,207
What?

149
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:19,541
How do you do business? Do you have brain?

150
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,832
You are always like that.

151
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:23,832
You always get drunk and leave the mess to me.

152
00:09:23,832 --> 00:09:25,582
No businessman would deal like this.

153
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:27,541
You just torture your own stomach.

154
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,874
Don't you think I am willing to do so?

155
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:30,249
Don't you think it's enjoyable to be drunk?

156
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:31,416
Stop it.

157
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,916
You always get mad after drunk!

158
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,416
I want it.

159
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,416
Stop!

160
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,374
Come here.

161
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:40,041
I don't want to be tortured again.

162
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:44,041
You are crazy, I want to divorce.

163
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:50,832
That's a real cat

164
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:55,499
Your Honour,
he loves throwing things after dunk.

165
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:56,457
I am scared.

166
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:58,291
I am afraid, sooner or later.

167
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,499
He would would throw my daughter to the street.

168
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,957
Your Honour,
he has serious psychological problem

169
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:07,082
How can a father,
who can't control his ownself.

170
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:09,582
To see his own kid alone?

171
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:13,041
Please stop him from visiting his daughter.

172
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:29,457
Good!

173
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:32,291
It's so noisy!

174
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,874
Turn it off! You bastard!

175
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,249
What's the matter?

176
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:37,291
Cheers!

177
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:41,707
He's like shit.

178
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,874
Cheers to shit!

179
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:46,082
You always make me mad!

180
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:48,207
You too!

181
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:11,541
My Supreme Buddha!

182
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:28,707
Kwai.

183
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,874
Bastard, if you don't quit this job.

184
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,749
Never come home again.

185
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:34,707
I won't quit.

186
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:35,624
Relation with you.

187
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,249
Break.

188
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:38,707
[...Will never...

189
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:39,499
Neglect...

190
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,666
my talent!

191
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,666
Good.

192
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,374
Thank you.

193
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:43,999
Bastard, how dar you!

194
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,082
What's wrong with you two?

195
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:47,416
Kwai, where are you going to?

196
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,874
Piss.

197
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,666
Then.

198
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,582
Comics

199
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,832
Kwai. Kwali.

200
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:55,499
Who is it?

201
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,041
Good morning auntie.

202
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,582
I brought some oranges.

203
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:00,957
- Cousin.
- Cousin.

204
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:04,166
Kwai...

205
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,624
Are you going to market that early?

206
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,541
I will support you forever.

207
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,666
Damn it.

208
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,707
Bastard, you are useless.

209
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:14,707
You quarreled with cousin, didn't you?

210
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:18,291
They always make me mad!

211
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,082
Cheers to make you mad!

212
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,166
Luckily I still have Kau Ann.

213
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,666
She is coming back.

214
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,082
I know she is coming back.

215
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:29,749
I couldn't have sound sleeps in these nights.

216
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,207
I've arranged everything.

217
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:34,916
I want to give her...surprise.

218
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:36,791
Very surprise.

219
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,582
Extremely surprise.

220
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:39,874
Quick, answer the phone.

221
00:12:39,874 --> 00:12:41,041
She will arrive tomorrow.

222
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,082
Let me talk to her

223
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:44,249
My dear cousin, I am Chung.

224
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:45,582
I miss you so much.

225
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:48,541
I know you are on the way back home.

226
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,332
I miss you so much

227
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,957
Remember not to miss the plane.

228
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:54,916
Bye, Bye

229
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,457
Cousin, I am now going to pack up.

230
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:00,082
Let's chat when I am back, alright?

231
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:01,416
Goddbye.

232
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:08,166
Cousin, she turns cool to me.

233
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:13,082
When she comes back, you will met everyday.

234
00:13:13,082 --> 00:13:15,291
Let the love of yours develop.

235
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,082
It will be much better.

236
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:18,499
I am going to burn the incense to thank God.

237
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:19,874
Foon, come here with me, come on.

238
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:22,582
When she returns.

239
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:26,041
I will stay with her everyday.

240
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:51,291
Dad, Mom. Cousin.

241
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,541
Kau An.

242
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,999
- Kau Kei.
- Sister.

243
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,791
Brother, where is sister-in-law?

244
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,957
Kau Ann, you look different?

245
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,707
You look different.

246
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:00,957
But you are still pretty.

247
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:03,166
Sure, I've lived in France so long.
I've changed a lot.

248
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,582
Let's go now.

249
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:05,874
Wait, I still have a friend.

250
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:09,749
Brother, hurry up.

251
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,457
Let me introduce.

252
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:15,291
My dad, my mom, my cousin, my brother.

253
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:15,916
Roberto

254
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,624
I'm touched for having
such a warm reception from you.

255
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,207
Auntie, I can tell from
the first sight you are a good mother.

256
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:23,082
Cousin, you are so tanned.

257
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,374
But uncle, you are different.

258
00:14:24,374 --> 00:14:25,207
You are like a piece of charcoal.

259
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:26,291
- Come on.
- Alright.

260
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,707
- Dad, go and get the car now.
- Go and get the car.

261
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:28,999
Your dad is really like a piece of charcoal.

262
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:29,957
Has he always eaten chocolate?

263
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:30,832
Let's go.

264
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:31,832
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

265
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:33,499
Roberto hasn't any relatives in Hong Kong.

266
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,749
So, he will live in our place.

267
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,749
- What?
- Don't you mind it?

268
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,041
Let's go.

269
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,207
It's time to go to the restaurant.

270
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:40,541
Aren't we going home?

271
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,041
Chung, you go with Ann.

272
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,624
And the rest of you, follow me.

273
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:45,707
Let's go

274
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:47,124
Canned sardines?

275
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:48,707
Big mouth.

276
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:50,332
See you later.

277
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,291
There is not much change in Hong Kong.

278
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,791
That stone is still here.

279
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:06,957
Bravo.

280
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:08,457
What's you name?

281
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:10,082
You may call me Roberto.

282
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:11,749
What?

283
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,166
Or, anything you like.

284
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,541
Are you grown up in foreign country?

285
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,624
Yes, when I was four.

286
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,332
First time to return.

287
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:20,207
How about your parents?

288
00:15:20,457 --> 00:15:21,916
They died.

289
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,749
When I was ten, I became orphan.

290
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,666
The, I followed my auntie to France.

291
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,166
Where is your auntie?

292
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,749
She died many years ago.

293
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:30,374
So, you have no relatives.

294
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,124
No.

295
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:33,791
I have a god-mother.

296
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:34,957
But she passed away last year.

297
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,832
You have had bad luck.

298
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:39,624
May God bless you, say something lucky!

299
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,874
Which room will he stay?

300
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,207
Guess?

301
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,207
See!

302
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:48,041
They match each other.

303
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,332
What is Roberto?

304
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:53,416
An ordinary friend of mine.

305
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,707
- Really?
- Why should I cheat you?

306
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:58,041
I don't have to worry then.

307
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,791
Cousin, from now on.

308
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,707
I won't let you leave me again.

309
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,791
You know...

310
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,791
When I see you, I am so impulsive...

311
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,541
I am so impulsive...

312
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,707
I do want to hold you tightly with may arms.

313
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:13,707
I know you need me too.

314
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,166
- Cousin.
- I want to give you a surprise.

315
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,749
Open it, I am giving you a surprise.

316
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:26,749
Like it?

317
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:27,999
Let's get married at once.

318
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,582
I want to hold you every night.

319
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:32,666
I want to kiss every inch of you.

320
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,666
Stop.

321
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,291
Do you want me to kiss you now?

322
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,582
I want to throw up.

323
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,291
Hold it...Wait a second...

324
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,291
Why did he stop suddenly?

325
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:42,499
Yeah.

326
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,832
Why did Ann throw up?

327
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,916
Maybe a plane sick.

328
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:54,957
What are you doing?

329
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:55,916
What are you doing?

330
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,291
What are you doing?

331
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,457
I didn't do anything.

332
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,416
Cousin! You'd better park the car.

333
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,999
I do want a rest.

334
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,124
Are you alright?

335
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:10,582
Brother, I am having a trouble.

336
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:11,416
What?

337
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,791
He forces me to marry him.

338
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:14,666
Really?

339
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,166
He said, he's strong intention to

340
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,207
hold me every night,

341
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:19,416
and kiss every inch of my body.

342
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,666
Every inch?

343
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,124
I wonder. Hongkies use centimeter

344
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,207
instead of inch in calculating.

345
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,666
Stop kidding.

346
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,082
Do you love him?

347
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,582
Well, we just grew up together.

348
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,999
So, go ahead.

349
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:35,957
You may say no.

350
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,332
Say no?

351
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:39,332
My dad would kill me.

352
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:41,916
So, ask you dad to marry him.

353
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:48,207
I wouldn't have treated my marriage as shift.

354
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:50,499
Bull shit

355
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:51,457
Know it is.

356
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,666
Kau Ann is back!

357
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,207
- Auntie!
- Sister

358
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:23,624
Well, what a perfect match!

359
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:26,249
You'd better call your auntie mom

360
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:31,374
Wealthy women.

361
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:34,332
Who is that guy?

362
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:36,791
From France, forget about him.

363
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:40,707
Please take you seat.

364
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,624
Brother is coming.

365
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:43,832
Brother Kwai.

366
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,957
Brother Kwai.

367
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,291
Break through.

368
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,082
Am I pretty?

369
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,624
Why you went into fugitive?

370
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:00,832
What a bastard! Sneaking move!

371
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:09,041
I know dad wants...Throw up.

372
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:09,957
So, go now.

373
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:11,416
It will create misunderstanding!

374
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,082
Don't talk.

375
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:18,457
Welcome

376
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,374
back

377
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,541
Come and sit here!

378
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,999
Sister, since it's big day.

379
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:32,582
Let's drink to celebrate it.

380
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:34,749
- Alright, come on.
- Not this one.

381
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:36,207
The wine.

382
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:37,416
Wine?

383
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,624
I don't know how to drink

384
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:39,666
and high blood pressure.

385
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,457
Don't worry, just little bit!

386
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:44,332
Come on! Drink!

387
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,749
You mean it?

388
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,957
At your age auntie,
you shouldn't drink too much.

389
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:58,291
Sit down, sit down first.

390
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,499
Help yourself.

391
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:03,499
Drink tea can help your digestive system.

392
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,124
Fast shitting.

393
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,166
Are you happy?

394
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:11,666
Yes.

395
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:14,166
Everything here are designed for you.

396
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,207
I think you've wasted too much money.

397
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:17,666
And.

398
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,457
I want to give you a real surprise.

399
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,041
Would you give me a break?

400
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:28,374
Dear friends.

401
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:30,207
Welcome to this party.

402
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:33,499
Today, I have a good news to announce.

403
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,874
I, Hou Chung.

404
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,332
I've grown up

405
00:20:37,582 --> 00:20:39,499
I hope all of you.

406
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,416
Will be my witness.

407
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,624
I want to announce,

408
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:46,207
my declaration of love to my cousin

409
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,291
I want to propose to my cousin Ann.

410
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,874
Thank you.

411
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,666
Help me.

412
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,124
What we do?

413
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:02,582
Ann, I will love you forever.

414
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,124
Never change.

415
00:21:04,124 --> 00:21:07,041
Marry him Ann, come on.

416
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,291
Please marry me, Ann.

417
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,916
Stop fooling.

418
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,249
Help me.

419
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:15,041
Dear friends.

420
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,374
Uncle, auntie,

421
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,832
in fact, what he has just done to Ann.

422
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:21,207
Last week, I did the same to Ann.

423
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,999
She promised to marry me.

424
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:26,166
I've paid the deposit too.

425
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,666
You are late.

426
00:21:39,957 --> 00:21:41,041
Cousin.

427
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,249
Cousin...

428
00:21:43,874 --> 00:21:44,874
Cousin.

429
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:46,874
You mean him an ordinary friend?

430
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:48,499
Pal, listen to me.

431
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,291
Tell you what.

432
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,874
I've got black belt in karate.

433
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,957
You are not right,
your cousin is so nice to you.

434
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:57,957
What a shame.

435
00:21:59,582 --> 00:22:01,457
Enjoy the dinner.

436
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:03,291
I've to chase my daughter back.

437
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,166
I've to teach her a lesion.

438
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,332
Enjoy your sorrow.

439
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:09,374
What'll we do now?

440
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,749
They are so nice.

441
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,541
Let's eat...

442
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,916
Your brother drives so fast,
I am afraid I can't follow

443
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,416
I am not family with Hong Kong.

444
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,707
Brother, you've dragged me down.

445
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:32,374
Turn your head back.

446
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:36,499
You kissed me before so many relatives.

447
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,999
Only such body languages.

448
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:40,124
Can cut verbal explanations, you know?

449
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:42,124
You said you have paid deposit!

450
00:22:42,124 --> 00:22:43,416
It will create misunderstanding!

451
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,624
You have to pay deposit.

452
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,499
You have to pay deposit to buy a good.

453
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:51,874
I want to throw up!

454
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:54,957
Do you mean it? Just one word
can make you throw up.

455
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,166
I mean it.

456
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:00,957
Why did they stop the car?

457
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,291
She throws up again?

458
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,166
Kidding?

459
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,457
Sister is going to marry such monster?

460
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,582
Will the babies of them be ETs?

461
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:17,207
You shouldn't worry too much.

462
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:21,332
Grandpa.

463
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:23,332
You go to see Grandpa.

464
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:24,666
You go by yourself.

465
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,749
If you go together,

466
00:23:25,749 --> 00:23:27,457
You'll scare him.

467
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:29,916
You share the room with Kau Kee.

468
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:30,749
What?

469
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:31,957
What a nightmare!

470
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:34,707
Just do what I told you, lead him to the room.

471
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:35,874
Come on.

472
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,707
No need for me to go?

473
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,332
- Yes.
- Make it tomorrow morning.

474
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:41,374
Good night.

475
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,749
Grandpa.

476
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:51,582
Grandpa.

477
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:54,916
When did you come back?

478
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:55,957
I just arrived.

479
00:23:55,957 --> 00:23:57,291
- Just arrived?
- Yes.

480
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,624
How are you?

481
00:23:58,624 --> 00:24:00,249
I brought something for you

482
00:24:00,249 --> 00:24:01,832
- For me?
- Yes.

483
00:24:01,832 --> 00:24:04,832
It's a massage machine. I brought it in Europe.

484
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:07,041
What's this?

485
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,416
Tattoo

486
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,749
It's fashion, Grandpa.

487
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,374
Don't bother Grandpa.

488
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:14,416
Isn't it fashion?

489
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,416
Yes

490
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,791
Let me talk with Grandpa a little bit longer.

491
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,416
Come here. I've got something to ask you.

492
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:21,999
Open it.

493
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:26,041
Be frank, is true?

494
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,249
What?

495
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,291
- Are you pregnant?
- Right?

496
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:32,416
Of course not.

497
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:34,832
Don't tell lie.

498
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:36,416
Don't touch my things.

499
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:43,541
Don't touch my books.

500
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:48,207
Would you please don't touch my luggage?

501
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:49,582
That bed is mine.

502
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:50,416
You sleep over there.

503
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,624
Don't mix up

504
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,207
How much money does he earn per month?

505
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:57,041
He's been jobless for a long time.

506
00:24:58,082 --> 00:25:00,207
He has a rich daddy, right?

507
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:04,957
He has no money to live in a hotel.

508
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:07,874
You love this kind of people?

509
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,499
I'm tired since I took a long flight.

510
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:13,499
Why don't you listen to me?

511
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:16,082
He is a little bit weird,

512
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,124
but later,

513
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:18,957
you will find out he's nice.

514
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:20,374
I go to sleep

515
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:21,874
Take it easy.

516
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:23,166
Can 1?

517
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:26,457
I think you can't

518
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,374
Let me talk with my daughter for a while.

519
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:30,249
I know she is somewhere around,
may I talk to her?

520
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:32,916
You're a witch!

521
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,416
Brother, what's wrong with you and your wife?

522
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:37,707
You better ask her.

523
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,124
Am I too nosy?

524
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:47,916
OK.

525
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,457
I am hungry.

526
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:05,291
You always fool around.

527
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:06,916
Why haven't you starved to death?

528
00:26:07,624 --> 00:26:10,791
I don't demand much from living.

529
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,874
If I were born some years earlier.
I'd have been a hippy.

530
00:26:12,874 --> 00:26:14,124
You are.

531
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:14,957
Really?

532
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:17,957
How can you marry my daughter?

533
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:20,249
Love, I guess.

534
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:23,457
Love? How can you afford her living?

535
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,416
Isn't it your duty?

536
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:27,166
You want to be an Adonis?

537
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,041
Such serious question...

538
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,041
I'll talk to you tomorrow morning.

539
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,832
Hey, you'd better tell me now.

540
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:32,999
How can you afford your family?

541
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:34,791
Alright, I'll look for a job.

542
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:35,916
I know...

543
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:37,832
What a tragedy!

544
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:40,582
Brother, how is it?

545
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,541
I don't think it fits me.

546
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,416
You'd dress up for an interview.

547
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:45,832
Aren't we go out for sight seeing?

548
00:26:45,832 --> 00:26:47,457
So dress up like a Hongkie!

549
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:48,582
Show me.

550
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:54,291
Not bad!

551
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:56,207
I'm not used to it

552
00:26:56,374 --> 00:26:58,249
You will be used to it.

553
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,249
Well,

554
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:00,249
Why not go to Guanzhou?

555
00:27:00,249 --> 00:27:01,166
What?

556
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,041
We've arrived.

557
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,124
- Take a picture, come on.
- Alright, come on.

558
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:09,999
Look this way.

559
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,499
Great! She fits you.

560
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:13,291
Really?

561
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:16,082
Not bad.

562
00:27:16,499 --> 00:27:17,707
Come on.

563
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:19,374
What?

564
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:21,707
So smart.

565
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,749
Go ahead.

566
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:24,416
What? I'm not that easy going.

567
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,249
I do want to choose.

568
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:27,916
Come on, this way.

569
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,416
Thank you.

570
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:38,707
Not much romance.

571
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:40,249
You are too selective.

572
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:41,249
No.

573
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,166
It's you who is blocking my way.

574
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:45,957
What?
- Any handsome guy?

575
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,207
I don't think he is.

576
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:51,124
Brother.

577
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:52,457
- Brother.
- Are you dealing business in Guangzhou?

578
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:53,791
Yes, let's eat.

579
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,416
I've checked out, I am leaving.

580
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,499
Why in a hurry?

581
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:57,666
I miss my daughter so much.

582
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,457
I am now hurrying to see her.

583
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:02,707
Divorced man.

584
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:04,791
Let's go.

585
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,999
Eat fast.

586
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,541
I don't want to eat.
- I've wasted few hours to feed you.

587
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:23,457
No.

588
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,082
You bitch, come and eat.

589
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:27,041
Hurry up.

590
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:30,666
You are so naughty.

591
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,999
I'll beat you if you don't eat.

592
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:38,082
Why did you beat my daughter?

593
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,457
Your daughter deserves to be beaten.

594
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:40,666
I won't do it.

595
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,707
Daughter.

596
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,749
Dad.

597
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:44,832
Baby.

598
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,582
- Daddy
- Baby

599
00:28:46,582 --> 00:28:48,082
I miss you so much

600
00:28:48,082 --> 00:28:49,082
Good girl.

601
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:51,082
Dad, it's you.

602
00:28:54,207 --> 00:28:55,957
You should eat.

603
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:57,666
Or the rats will bite your ass.

604
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:02,332
Mom is back.

605
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:06,457
Uncle George always goes out with mom.

606
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,707
What are you doing?

607
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,624
Come down!

608
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,832
Come down!

609
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:14,124
Stop stabbing me.

610
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:15,166
Come down!

611
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,166
I will call the police to arrest you.

612
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:20,749
You can't see her under
the judgment of the court.

613
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:22,291
You always enjoy yourself
but didn't care about her.

614
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,999
- How dare you say so?
- Mr. Yam,

615
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,541
being the lawyer of Yuet Yung

616
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:26,416
I am now warning you.

617
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,166
- According to the ordinance of the court,
- Stop it.

618
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,374
You are expert in those divorce cases.

619
00:29:29,374 --> 00:29:31,332
And you're good at courting the divorced women.

620
00:29:31,332 --> 00:29:33,874
How dare you be that cheap!

621
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:36,457
If you keep talking like this,
I'll sue you of slandering.

622
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:37,582
The police are coming.

623
00:29:38,332 --> 00:29:41,624
Disappear now, or you will have trouble.

624
00:29:41,624 --> 00:29:43,582
One two,

625
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:44,749
Three.

626
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,124
What a chicken.

627
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:50,707
Daddy...

628
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:55,332
What do you want?

629
00:29:57,207 --> 00:29:58,999
What's next?

630
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,707
Next...

631
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:02,624
Watch this.

632
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:05,707
This is not for sale yet.

633
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:06,541
Bravo.

634
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:07,749
Give it to me, I will treat you ice cream.

635
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:09,249
Let me have a look first.

636
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:11,374
I will tell you the story now.

637
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,374
Yes...

638
00:30:13,374 --> 00:30:15,624
What an amazing story.

639
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:19,832
A Jurassic Saint
and the Evil has fought severely.

640
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:25,541
In the war, they can find out
the real meaning of love.

641
00:30:28,874 --> 00:30:29,999
Give it to me.

642
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:32,916
Yam Kau Kei. How dare you!

643
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:35,166
How dare you bring such nonsense book here...

644
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,874
You have set up
a wrong image to the classmates.

645
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:37,624
Miss Ho...

646
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:38,957
You'd copy
the school regulations for 500 times.

647
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:40,624
And ask your parents to see me.

648
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:41,541
Please don't.

649
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:42,541
Not today.

650
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,499
But see me tomorrow after school

651
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:48,874
I just do it for your own good.

652
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:52,249
You will know it after you leave school.

653
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:09,249
Brother, you should help me.

654
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,957
I've brought the clothes of my dad.

655
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:14,999
If he knows my teacher wants to see him.

656
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,291
He will break my head.

657
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:20,124
You deserve it.

658
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,541
How dare you! You are heartless.

659
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:25,041
I just want to promote the book for you

660
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:26,957
I...

661
00:31:26,957 --> 00:31:28,207
Don't...

662
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:29,499

663
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:33,582
You how Plain Coffee
is complaint against your comic?

664
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:35,916
It's a bad publication.

665
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:37,874
It will harm the kids.

666
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:39,249
And it's drawn badly.

667
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:42,291
Cheap words too.

668
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,874
So, you admit it.

669
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:46,666
Go now.

670
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:50,582
Don't make her angry.

671
00:31:50,582 --> 00:31:52,707
Or, she will kick me out to the school.

672
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:53,416
What?

673
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,291
If she scolds you, just smile.

674
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,207
Nod your head, and say something nonsense.

675
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:00,832
She is called Plain Coffee?

676
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:02,082
How dare you? Lower you voice.

677
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:04,082
She loves standing behind others.

678
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:07,791
Miss Ho,

679
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,249

681
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:11,332

He doesn't pay attention is studying.

686
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:24,749
He doesn't care his homework too.

687
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:27,666
He loves chatting with classmates and eating.

688
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,749
Book...

689
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:30,457
He brought such comics back to school.

00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:31,916
It harms the other classmates.

691
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,332

692
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:35,207
The meanings of such comics are harmful.

You look.

694
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,082
It's not Chinese at all.

695
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,332
Drawing.

696
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:43,582
It's poor.

697
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:44,832
You...

698
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,332
I am teaching arts.

699
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,874
So ll think

700
00:32:47,874 --> 00:32:49,582

00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:54,582
Only the bitch and
the noneducated people will love it.

704
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:55,541

705
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,749

Mr. Yam.

712
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,707
You'd better apologise.

713
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:06,624
You...

714
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:08,374

Like father like son.

717

You named you son Kau Kee, it's too foolish!

718
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:15,041
What a failure.

719
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:16,499

760
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,707

766
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:18,999
Angel likes eating sweet soup

767
00:38:23,582 --> 00:38:24,416

768
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,249

Sir

772
00:38:58,416 --> 00:38:59,374
Isn't it enough?

773
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:00,832
Stop staring or I will call the police.

774
00:39:00,832 --> 00:39:02,291
Idiot.

775
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,082

776
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:06,166
Fresh vegetables.

777
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,457
Buy a little bit.

778
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,499

00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:24,207

00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:35,582
Sister, I've just
eaten sweep soup with my friend

792
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,207
You haven't eaten rice, but you ate dessert?

793
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:38,416
Let's eat first!

794
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:41,582
Did you go with a boyfriend?

795
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:42,749
No.

796
00:39:43,207 --> 00:39:45,041
There must be something wrong!

797
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:46,791
I've told you many times.

798
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:48,249
You can never trust the man.

799
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:49,707
Say our dad!

800
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:52,249
After our birth,
he didn't leave a word but went sailing.

801
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:54,291
When mom died, he was not will to come back.

802
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,082
Sister, please stop

803
00:39:56,082 --> 00:39:57,957
Or I can eat.

804
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:01,249
Didn't any boy date you?

805
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:02,707
No!

806
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:15,416
This is...for...

807
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:16,707

00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,541
Pictures?

810
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:21,957
Let's take pictures with them.

811
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,249
Sister...Sister...

812
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,624
Be good.

813
00:40:39,624 --> 00:40:41,041
Greet him now.

814
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:42,957
Good morning brother

815
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:44,749
Good...

816
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:45,916
Mor...

817
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:46,707
Morning.

818
00:40:46,707 --> 00:40:47,666
He is from another school.

819
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,166
Don't be naughty!

820
00:40:53,457 --> 00:40:54,457
Treat...

821
00:40:54,457 --> 00:40:54,999
Me...

822
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,124
Go good.

823
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:57,374
Treat me

824
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,791
Idiot!

825
00:41:01,957 --> 00:41:03,207
What did you say?

826
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:06,416
I look idiot?

827
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:07,791
What did you say?

828
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:09,207
Today is my holiday.

829
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:10,666
I want to see you.

830
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:12,041
But I should be the volunteer.

831
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:14,166
I just want you to play with us.

832
00:41:14,707 --> 00:41:16,207
I can't imagine you would see them in such way

833
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,791
They are no monsters.

834
00:41:17,791 --> 00:41:19,166
They are just less luckier than us.

835
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:21,207
I...

836
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:23,082
Forget it. If you don't like them,
just leave us alone.

837
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:25,249
Sau Kit, Sau Kit.

838
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,749
Sorry, I don't mean it.

839
00:41:26,749 --> 00:41:28,666
I misunderstood that you pity me.

840
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,624
Why did you speak so fluently?

841
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:32,874
I...

842
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:34,832
Try again, to speak fluently.

843
00:41:34,832 --> 00:41:36,499
Anxious.

844
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:38,207
Then I make it.

845
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,166
Why?

846
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:41,957
I and

847
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,957
Dad...

848
00:41:42,957 --> 00:41:46,249
Live together 5 years.

849
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,666
Didn't talk

850
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:49,791
Hm

851
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:51,541
Please don't

852
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:53,374
I haven't had dad since I was small.

853
00:41:53,374 --> 00:41:55,249
I do want to have a dad.

854
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:59,666
Sor...ry

855
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:08,499
Let's go and take pictures

856
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:13,624
Take...

857
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,082
Sit closer.

858
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:19,624
Step back!

859
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:20,541
Sit closer.

860
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:22,291
Step back!

861
00:42:24,374 --> 00:42:25,874
- Sit closer.
- Step back!

862
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:32,332
Sor...ry

863
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:33,874
Are you alright!

864
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:44,999
Do you want to play with me?

865
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,707
No. I just want to hit you.

866
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,124
I did want to beat you in the restaurant.

867
00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:50,041
But I didn't want to do it
in front of those people

868
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:54,707
Why don't you go ahead now?

869
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,791
There is nobody around,
it's no use to beat you!

870
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:00,082
France must be a country of free sex.

871
00:43:00,082 --> 00:43:03,041
You must have known
many styles on sex techniques.

872
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,082
My cousin is so innocent.

873
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,499
To be tempted by you.

874
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:07,249
We Chinese.

875
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:09,416
To buy anything you want.

876
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,332
Unlike you.

877
00:43:10,332 --> 00:43:12,749
Your brain is filled with sex.

878
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:13,624
Hey, run two rounds.

879
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,916
They you won't feel any sex desire.

880
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,499
I am going to tell you.

881
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:18,874
My cousin and I have fallen in love.

882
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:20,624
Since we started our puberty.

883
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:22,416
You just fell for her only,

884
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:23,249
Who cares.

885
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:24,499
It's love anyway.

886
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:26,041
You interrupted suddenly.

887
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:27,957
I know, you just want the wealth of my uncle.

888
00:43:27,957 --> 00:43:29,416
Give me a price!

889
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:30,624
Price?

890
00:43:30,624 --> 00:43:32,332
You think I am a gigolo?

891
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,499
Tell you cousin.

892
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:35,332
I think you have been rich enough.

893
00:43:35,332 --> 00:43:37,166
To buy anything you want.

894
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,207
But I tell you.

895
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:40,374
Love is depended on power.

896
00:43:40,624 --> 00:43:43,041
Obviously I am taller than you.

897
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,457
But you are not white enough.

898
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,957
It is another kind of attraction.

899
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,124
Some girls said I am really sexy.

900
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:50,207
Sexy.

901
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,124
It's not sex, but sexy, adjective.

902
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:53,374
Sexy, follow me.

903
00:43:53,374 --> 00:43:54,707
Don't say too fast

904
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:57,791
Sex...y

905
00:43:57,791 --> 00:43:59,541
Sex...y

906
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,874
- Where were we up to?
- Up to?

907
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:03,499
In fact, you are too proud.

908
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:04,749
That's why, you miss something.

909
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:05,541
What it it?

910
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:07,874
Failure.

911
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:09,374
You should meet failure frequently.

912
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:11,332
Experience how tobe teased, mocked by others.

913
00:44:11,332 --> 00:44:14,999
So, it will help you and your future.

914
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:18,499
I wonder, does failure help?

915
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:20,082
You've got it.

916
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,249
Can you help me?

917
00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:23,332
What?

918
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:24,499
Step on me tease me.

919
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:25,749
Torture me.

920
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:27,541
- Really?
- Really.

921
00:44:38,499 --> 00:44:40,499
For my future's sake,

922
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:42,999
Can you teach me one more lesion?

923
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:44,666
I am busy now.

924
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:45,999
Make it next time.

925
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:49,291
Des failure help?

926
00:44:49,374 --> 00:44:51,207
Don't chase after me.

927
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:52,832
Call me Mimi.

928
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:56,124
Isn't it called love?

929
00:44:57,374 --> 00:44:59,666
Master Wong Fai-hong
most powerful No-shadow kick.

930
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:01,666
I've got the secret of it.

931
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,999
When the enemy doesn't move...

932
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:04,916
You move when he moves.

933
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,249
Attack his face.

934
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,582
When his hand presses yours down.

935
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:10,332
Attack his eyes again.

936
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,332
And kick follows.

937
00:45:11,957 --> 00:45:13,582
This is no-shadow kick.

938
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:15,791
Since he is not prepared.

939
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,041
He just cares the upper part only.

940
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:18,457
He won't care his lower part.

941
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:20,457
So, this is called No-shadow-kick.

942
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:22,666
And its' call Dick Kick. Got me?

943
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,707
Yes, grandpa.

944
00:45:27,832 --> 00:45:29,624
It's so pretty.

945
00:45:30,082 --> 00:45:33,041
This is the most up date fashion in Europe.

946
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:34,874
Did you make it yourself.

947
00:45:34,874 --> 00:45:36,041
Sure.

948
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,749
I studied fashion design for three year.

949
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:40,624
Like it? I will knit one for you.

950
00:45:40,624 --> 00:45:42,999
All dead.

951
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:44,207
Again

952
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:47,666
One dies after the other

953
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:49,624
The cat will love it.

954
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:50,707
Not enough oxygen, right?

955
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,249
Of course not.

956
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:55,541
Don't pretend to be an expert.

957
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:56,916
Let me try.

958
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,707
You are jobless.

959
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:03,332
Have you ever worried of poverty?

960
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:04,874
But I am rich in my heart.

961
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:06,707
Uncle, don't think that I am criticizing you.

962
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:09,457
You have good food, but you never happy.

963
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:11,166
Although I am poor.

964
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:11,916
I am happy.

965
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,916
My daughter will suffer so much!

966
00:46:14,207 --> 00:46:15,207
It's fixed.

967
00:46:17,582 --> 00:46:19,207
You are great!

968
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:21,207
I studied engineering in college.

969
00:46:23,582 --> 00:46:26,207
My drunken son is back.

970
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:28,332
Ah. Just like shit.

971
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,666
See how awful is your look!

972
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:32,957
Sooner or later, I will be driven crazy by you.

973
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,332
Foon.

974
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:37,916
You bastard, you always blame your son.

975
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:39,207
Shut up.

976
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:40,457
Are you blaming me?

977
00:46:40,457 --> 00:46:42,749
You are blaming your son too.

978
00:46:45,499 --> 00:46:47,499
Forget it.

979
00:46:47,499 --> 00:46:49,666
Or, one more son will leave us.

980
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:52,166
Go.

981
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:55,332
My dear grandson, forget about them.

982
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,041
They are much more tougher than me.Damn it.

983
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:01,124
Brother Fu, you can't drink all day.

984
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:04,666
When I think of my daughter, my heart hurts.

985
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:07,291
You have to think something.

986
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:09,791
The nasty woman keeps
very close to my daughter, how?

987
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:10,916
But you can use your brain to fill the gap.

988
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:11,791
Fill the gap?

989
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:13,416
Don't you think I am a magician?

990
00:47:17,332 --> 00:47:18,999
No, I don't want it.

991
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:21,291
Bad girl, I can't tolerate you.

992
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,207
Me too!

993
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:23,457
What's the matter?

994
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:26,499
I hate serving you.

995
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:28,582
Daughter, I have to work.

996
00:47:28,582 --> 00:47:30,082
I can't take care of you all day.

997
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:31,207
You always kick the maid away.

998
00:47:31,207 --> 00:47:33,791
Don't you want me to lock you up?

999
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:40,499
Hello, Miss Chan, I am Mrs. Yam.

1000
00:47:40,499 --> 00:47:41,624
Right, it's me again.

1001
00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:43,291
My maid has left.

1002
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:46,124
Please find another for me.

1003
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:49,041
I am hurrying to work, right.

1004
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:51,666
Exporting labour from Russia?

1005
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:52,749
Anything will do.

1006
00:47:52,749 --> 00:47:54,582
Sharon?

1007
00:47:56,207 --> 00:48:00,749
Hang up so fast.

1008
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:05,749
Sharon?

1009
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,832
Come in...

1010
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:10,582
You are employed.

1011
00:48:10,582 --> 00:48:11,582
She is my daughter.

1012
00:48:11,582 --> 00:48:13,374
Feed her.

1013
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:14,916
If she doesn't listen to you,

1014
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:16,041
just spank her ass.

1015
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:17,166
Mom.

1016
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:19,707
Be good, I am late.

1017
00:48:19,707 --> 00:48:21,332
Remember to feed her.

1018
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:22,707
Thank you

1019
00:48:26,957 --> 00:48:29,082
- Baby
- Don't come close to me.

1020
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,624
Be good.

1021
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:32,999
Let me feed you.

1022
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,041
Baby, if you don't eat,

1023
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,666
the rats will bite your ass.

1024
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:40,916
Daddy

1025
00:48:41,457 --> 00:48:43,832
Daddy

1026
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,832
Does she return?

1027
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:51,249
I am Sharon.

1028
00:48:51,249 --> 00:48:52,541
We've employed someone else.

1029
00:48:53,124 --> 00:48:54,249
So strange.

1030
00:48:54,874 --> 00:48:57,999
Listen carefully.

1031
00:48:57,999 --> 00:48:59,166
We must...

1032
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,916
be sure win.

1033
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:02,791
Ever success.

1034
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:03,666
Alright.

1035
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,666
He is crazy.

1036
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:06,166
Don't you think it's a war?

1037
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:08,416
You are so clumsy.

1038
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:10,041
It's you who is clumsy.

1039
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,624
If you answer back again, I won't let you go.

1040
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,916
Mom is not going, she bored us.

1041
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:18,582
She is always like that.

1042
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:19,707
Let me go.

1043
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,124
- Alright, get in the car.
- Auntie,

1044
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,249
why don't you go fishing with us?

1045
00:49:24,249 --> 00:49:25,957
I dislike going out to meet others.

1046
00:49:25,957 --> 00:49:28,124
I don't know what clothing should I wear.

1047
00:49:28,124 --> 00:49:30,666
If I dress not properly, it is not good.

1048
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:31,957
You can't put it in that way.

1049
00:49:31,957 --> 00:49:34,457
If you dress up, you would be very pretty.

1050
00:49:34,457 --> 00:49:35,624
Are you kidding?

1051
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:36,666
I am serious.

1052
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:41,707
If you make up a little bit,

1053
00:49:41,707 --> 00:49:44,957
say, put some shadow...set your hard.

1054
00:49:44,957 --> 00:49:46,707
And the dress should be...

1055
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:47,749
How is it?

1056
00:49:56,832 --> 00:49:59,332
You are not serious in fishing.

1057
00:49:59,332 --> 00:50:01,832
My name means not serious in Chinese.

1058
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,916
Foon.

1059
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,624
You can't get any fish in this way.

1060
00:50:07,624 --> 00:50:09,666
Don't bother me, just mind your own

1061
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,124
Can you get any fish?

1062
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,666
See.

1063
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:18,374
Granny, very big fish.

1064
00:50:18,374 --> 00:50:20,916
You don't list to the senior.

1065
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:22,541
Learn from me.

1066
00:50:24,082 --> 00:50:25,416
Like a cooked dog!

1067
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:26,207
Grand-dad.

1068
00:50:26,207 --> 00:50:27,499
Damn it.

1069
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:28,749
Thank you.

1070
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:30,707
It's no big deal.

1071
00:50:30,707 --> 00:50:32,082
I don't have to listen to you.

1072
00:50:33,332 --> 00:50:35,624
You use such big sausage to fish!

1073
00:50:35,624 --> 00:50:37,291
You don't listen to me.

1074
00:50:37,374 --> 00:50:38,457
Uncle.

1075
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:41,832
You just blame others without self reflecting.

1076
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,999
You didn't listen to your dad too.

1077
00:50:45,166 --> 00:50:46,916
Why don't you give him freedom
to do his own job?

1078
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:49,166
Come and eat.

1079
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:52,499
What's wrong?

1080
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:53,457
I'm burnt.

1081
00:50:53,457 --> 00:50:54,166
Come on...

1082
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:54,916
What?

1083
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:55,916
Put some honey on it.

1084
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:58,207
It will make you feel comfortable.

1085
00:50:58,291 --> 00:50:59,624
Isn't it?

1086
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,124
You do concern me.

1087
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:04,874
We are pretending to be lovers, aren't we?

1088
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:06,624
I will leave next week.

1089
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:09,332
It hurts.

1090
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,332
Too much exaggeration!

1091
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:14,249
Will you miss me?

1092
00:51:14,249 --> 00:51:15,457
My mom is flattered by you.

1093
00:51:15,457 --> 00:51:16,957
She will be the one who misses you most.

1094
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:18,416
You whole family is flattered by me!

1095
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:19,457
Ah!

1096
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:21,291
Come come come

1097
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:24,499
Let's pretend to be loves.

1098
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,916
Granny wants a piece of steak.

1099
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:28,332
I will do it.

1100
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:30,832
- Honey, keep on please.
- Sure.

1101
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:33,791
Hey, my idol.

1102
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:34,832
How is it?

1103
00:51:34,832 --> 00:51:37,749
Did you make my sister pregnant?

1104
00:51:38,457 --> 00:51:40,499
Your sister is a nice girl.

1105
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:41,624
How can you talk such thing behind her?

1106
00:51:41,624 --> 00:51:42,916
Are you fooling me?

1107
00:51:42,916 --> 00:51:43,749
How?

1108
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:45,791
You are great in taking my cousin's girl.

1109
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,624
He is totally failed because of you!

1110
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,916
Can you keep the secret?

1111
00:51:51,624 --> 00:51:52,832
I don't think you can.

1112
00:51:52,832 --> 00:51:54,332
But I will tell you too.

1113
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:56,791
Your sister and I have been good friends.

1114
00:51:56,957 --> 00:51:59,416
But she uses me to brush your cousin off.

1115
00:52:00,082 --> 00:52:02,999
I will leave next week,
I've book a flight already.

1116
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:04,916
Really?

1117
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,374
Of course no.

1118
00:52:09,374 --> 00:52:10,749
I won't ell you the truth.

1119
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:11,999
For you are too nosy.

1120
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:19,541
Mom...

1121
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:20,749
Am I alright?

1122
00:52:20,749 --> 00:52:21,999
You are pretty.

1123
00:52:21,999 --> 00:52:22,707
Really?

1124
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:24,041
Over there.

1125
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:27,041
Do you understand?

1126
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:28,791
Not understand.

1127
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:30,166
What's you opinion?

1128
00:52:30,166 --> 00:52:31,457
It's nice looking

1129
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,832
Wah. What's wrong with you?

1130
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:37,457
Pretty woman...

1131
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:39,374
Are you enjoying the breeze?

1132
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,249
How dare you take my wife's advantage?

1133
00:52:42,249 --> 00:52:45,541
She wants praise of her dressing, doesn't she?

1134
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:47,207
Do you want me to beat you up.

1135
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,749
Do you mean it?

1136
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:52,374
Foon.

1137
00:52:53,249 --> 00:52:54,541
Step aside.

1138
00:53:02,582 --> 00:53:04,041
Granny, stay away.

1139
00:53:04,166 --> 00:53:06,249
I don't want others
think I am bullying an old man.

1140
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:26,541
Daughter-in-law

1141
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:28,457
never.

1142
00:53:28,999 --> 00:53:31,207
Dress such sexy clothes again.

1143
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,249
What a shame!

1144
00:53:33,249 --> 00:53:34,416
Can you hear?

1145
00:53:34,582 --> 00:53:36,041
Damn it!

1146
00:53:43,707 --> 00:53:45,416
Boss.

1147
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:46,874
Come tomorrow.

1148
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:48,791
Thank you boss. Let's call it a day.

1149
00:53:53,457 --> 00:53:55,416
Madam, you are back.

1150
00:53:55,874 --> 00:53:59,124
You have cleaned my house!

1151
00:53:59,124 --> 00:54:00,624
Thank you very much.

1152
00:54:00,624 --> 00:54:01,999
It's my job.

1153
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:03,082
Where is baby?

1154
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:04,499
She is sleeping.

1155
00:54:05,582 --> 00:54:08,582
Sharon, you are a good helper.

1156
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:10,041
You are flattering me.

1157
00:54:10,332 --> 00:54:12,124
I am so tired.

1158
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,207
Come in and massage me please.

1159
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,416
Sharon.

1160
00:54:17,832 --> 00:54:19,082
Come on.

1161
00:54:19,874 --> 00:54:22,791
Why are you fluent in speaking Mandarin?

1162
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,791
My father is a Chinese.

1163
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,499
My mom is a Russian, so I know Mandarin.

1164
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:30,166
Russia.

1165
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,249
That's why6 you are so tall.

1166
00:54:33,457 --> 00:54:34,416
Come on.

1167
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:38,541
Madam, your skin is so smooth.

1168
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:40,166
Answer it please.

1169
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:41,124
Ah

1170
00:54:43,374 --> 00:54:44,416
Hello!

1171
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:45,207
Who?

1172
00:54:45,207 --> 00:54:46,374
Your ex-husband.

1173
00:54:46,374 --> 00:54:47,999
If he calls again, scold him.

1174
00:54:47,999 --> 00:54:49,374
Why not scold him now.

1175
00:54:49,374 --> 00:54:51,874
And curse him too, don't you agree.

1176
00:54:51,874 --> 00:54:52,832
Great!

1177
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,957
Damn you, you evil, monster,

1178
00:54:55,957 --> 00:54:56,999
You are shit.

1179
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:57,916
Bastard.

1180
00:54:57,916 --> 00:54:59,416
You don't feel shame.

1181
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:01,249
If you bother my Madam,
I'll ask someone beat you up.

1182
00:55:01,249 --> 00:55:02,416
Any more?

1183
00:55:03,124 --> 00:55:04,999
Every words tell my heart.

1184
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:07,249
Go to hell

1185
00:55:15,666 --> 00:55:17,832
Will it be too much.

1186
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:20,541
No, he is cheap, he deserves it.

1187
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:21,916
How can he be
so heatless to brush his wife off.

1188
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:22,999
Yes.

1189
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,374
Do you still miss him?

1190
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:35,916
If he didn't get drunk, he treated me well.

1191
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:42,291
We had a happy family.

1192
00:55:43,332 --> 00:55:44,624
Right.

1193
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:49,874
It's so windy.

1194
00:55:49,874 --> 00:55:53,207
Let me close the windows
otherwise you get cold.

1195
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:56,749
It must be that bastard, let me open the door.

1196
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:01,207
You rang a wrong bell.

1197
00:56:01,999 --> 00:56:04,582
- He rang a wrong bell
- Sharon, he is George.

1198
00:56:06,832 --> 00:56:08,041
Sorry.

1199
00:56:09,957 --> 00:56:11,791
Why did you curse me through the line?

1200
00:56:12,374 --> 00:56:13,541
What? Did he call?

1201
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,082
Are you Yam Kau Fu?

1202
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:16,291
Are you Yam Kau Fu?

1203
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:17,791
Wrong number only.

1204
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,707
Please give me a glass of beer.

1205
00:56:20,582 --> 00:56:22,666
I was in real bad luck!

1206
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:23,416
What's the matter?

1207
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:24,916
I miss you so much.

1208
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:28,999
I am worring about you.

1209
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:31,999
That's why I come to see you at once.

1210
00:56:32,832 --> 00:56:34,124
Let me put some ice in it.

1211
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,624
Aren't you busy today?

1212
00:56:35,624 --> 00:56:39,166
My paper work is less important than you.

1213
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,624
- Be serious.
- We don't mind old tricks,

1214
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:42,124
Most important of all, it works.

1215
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:45,207
You hand is so cold.

1216
00:56:45,207 --> 00:56:46,916
Let me warm them!

1217
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,874
My heart is freezing, how can my hands be warm?

1218
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,332
You want a warm heart? It's easy.

1219
00:56:53,332 --> 00:56:55,374
Madam baby needs you.

1220
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,707
Please go and take a look.

1221
00:57:06,582 --> 00:57:07,791
Hello!

1222
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,916
Are you looking for me?

1223
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:13,666
I am having a meeting. I will call you tonight.

1224
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:16,082
Bye Bye.

1225
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,874
Cold beer, Mr. George

1226
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,082
Thank you

1227
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:23,332
Wait.

1228
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:25,249
You look familiar to me.

1229
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,416
You are like...

1230
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:32,874
Oriental Sharon Stone.

1231
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:40,166
Are you mixed?

1232
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,041
<i>Yes, Chinese and Russia!</i>

1233
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,749
You are attractive.

1234
00:57:50,332 --> 00:57:52,166
You are good at speaking Cantonese.

1235
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,374
Thank you you dad.

1236
00:57:57,499 --> 00:57:59,957
Your feet are pretty.

1237
00:57:59,957 --> 00:58:01,332
Thank you mom.

1238
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:05,832
George, will you stay here for dinner?

1239
00:58:05,832 --> 00:58:08,916
I don't want to leave tonight.
Give me a chance.

1240
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:09,791
Please don't.

1241
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,207
We are adults.

1242
00:58:11,207 --> 00:58:13,999
So, we can do something for adults.

1243
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:17,707
What's wrong?

1244
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:18,874
Excuse me!

1245
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,832
Earthquakes.

1246
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,957
Stomach-ache.

1247
00:58:24,957 --> 00:58:25,749
George.

1248
00:58:27,957 --> 00:58:29,457
Are you alright?

1249
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:31,749
What's wrong with you?

1250
00:58:32,457 --> 00:58:34,249
George, may I accompany you to the hospital?

1251
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:36,374
No need, I can handle by myself.

1252
00:58:36,374 --> 00:58:37,499
I will call you later.

1253
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:38,457
Take care.

1254
00:58:38,457 --> 00:58:41,457
Madam, George isn't good at all.

1255
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:43,124
He farted!

1256
00:58:43,624 --> 00:58:44,916
He had a stomach ache.

1257
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:47,416
But he is nice to me and always makes me happy.

1258
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:50,041
He wants to sleep with you, so he flatters you.

1259
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:53,666
Every woman wants to be flattered.

1260
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:56,249
If my ex-husband was like him,

1261
00:58:56,249 --> 00:58:58,249
we wouldn't have divorced.

1262
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:00,999
Sharon, we are women.

1263
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:02,374
You should understand me.

1264
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:04,541
Yes, I do.

1265
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:06,166
Sharon.

1266
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:08,999
I am not in good mood.

1267
00:59:09,124 --> 00:59:11,541
Why not chat with me?

1268
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:12,957
Great.

1269
00:59:12,957 --> 00:59:14,999
Tell me how your husband courted you.

1270
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:16,332
How nice he treated you.

1271
00:59:16,332 --> 00:59:17,707
He must have some benefits.

1272
00:59:17,707 --> 00:59:20,166
Do you remember? Tell me.

1273
00:59:24,124 --> 00:59:26,332
I

1274
00:59:28,707 --> 00:59:29,416
You...

1275
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:30,624
What did you say?

1276
00:59:30,624 --> 00:59:32,166
Is any word missing?

1277
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:33,874
I...

1278
00:59:34,082 --> 00:59:35,416
Draw...

1279
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:36,749
Better...

1280
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,832
Than talk

1281
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:41,416
Maybe, it's better to tell me through your lips

1282
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,124
I...

1283
00:59:47,124 --> 00:59:48,291
Ah!...

1284
00:59:49,541 --> 00:59:52,541
Don't be that serious.

1285
00:59:52,749 --> 00:59:55,041
I...

1286
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:55,999
Uncle...

1287
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:57,082
Baby.

1288
00:59:57,082 --> 00:59:59,707
Did you bumb into someone?

1289
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:02,291
Why are you so free?

1290
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,041
You haven't gone home for a long time.

1291
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:05,291
You...

1292
01:00:05,416 --> 01:00:07,082
How to know...

1293
01:00:07,082 --> 01:00:09,082
Uncle, she is my maid.

1294
01:00:10,249 --> 01:00:11,499
Sharon.

1295
01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:12,999
Sharon, my uncle.

1296
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:14,541
Maid.

1297
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:17,791
Uncle, everyone knows
you haven't home for a lone time.

1298
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:19,041
You know?

1299
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:22,499
Alright, cut the crap to escape anymore mistake

1300
01:00:22,499 --> 01:00:24,332
Let's not bother him to court girl.

1301
01:00:24,332 --> 01:00:25,291
Mistake again.

1302
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:26,249
Let's go some place to have fun.

1303
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:28,499
Bye bye uncle.

1304
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,957
My brother

1305
01:00:30,957 --> 01:00:32,041
Daughter.

1306
01:00:33,082 --> 01:00:33,916
She...

1307
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:34,749
Marriage.

1308
01:00:34,749 --> 01:00:35,999
Divorce.

1309
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,832
She is too young to have a divorce.

1310
01:00:38,874 --> 01:00:39,957
I...

1311
01:00:39,957 --> 01:00:40,791
Slowly...

1312
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:41,499
Tell...

1313
01:00:41,499 --> 01:00:42,666
You...

1314
01:00:42,957 --> 01:00:44,874
Haven't you gone home for a long time?

1315
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:46,624
I...

1316
01:00:46,624 --> 01:00:48,082
Take you...

1317
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:49,041
To see my mom.

1318
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:50,249
So soon?

1319
01:00:50,249 --> 01:00:51,207
I am afraid...

1320
01:00:51,207 --> 01:00:51,957
She...

1321
01:00:51,957 --> 01:00:53,124
Is nice...

1322
01:00:53,124 --> 01:00:54,541
Good mother...

1323
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:55,749
How about your dad?

1324
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:00,707
Go.

1325
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:11,124
Wong Chi Keung,
you can't draw as you wish.

1326
01:01:11,124 --> 01:01:14,041
First, focus the thing you are going to draw.

1327
01:01:17,082 --> 01:01:18,832
Daddy of Yam Kau Kee.

1328
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:22,541
How is it?

1329
01:01:22,832 --> 01:01:24,249
Draw the way you like.

1330
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,624
You look so smart.

1331
01:01:40,832 --> 01:01:41,874
To match him?

1332
01:01:41,874 --> 01:01:43,041
To match you!

1333
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:46,291
It's true.

1334
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:49,957
Who are you looking for?

1335
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,082
I am the Discipline Officer
of Kau Kee's school.

1336
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:53,332
I want to see his mom.

1337
01:01:53,332 --> 01:01:55,416
Please come in.

1338
01:01:55,416 --> 01:01:56,791
I am his mom

1339
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,041
You...

1340
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:01,541
You are his mom?

1341
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:02,707
Did he break any school regulations?

1342
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:03,582
Hold it!

1343
01:02:03,582 --> 01:02:06,082
Is Yam's dad your husband?

1344
01:02:06,082 --> 01:02:07,791
How can you raise such a question?

1345
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:11,582
I see.

1346
01:02:11,582 --> 01:02:12,957
You are bought to be his dad's wife.

1347
01:02:12,957 --> 01:02:14,166
You married him when he was just a baby.

1348
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:17,041
So, you raised your husband and your son.

1349
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,916
Such awful Chinese custom is till existing now.

1350
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:21,082
What did you say? Please come in!

1351
01:02:21,374 --> 01:02:22,707
I pity you.

1352
01:02:22,707 --> 01:02:24,791
By the way, it's the fault of the men.

1353
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:25,874
You are old.

1354
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:28,541
But he shouldn't court my sister.

1355
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:29,624
What?

1356
01:02:29,624 --> 01:02:30,749
Scandal?

1357
01:02:30,749 --> 01:02:33,541
Your husband is courting his son's teacher.

1358
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,332
My sister is too innocent.

1359
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:38,374
That's why he dresses in that way!

1360
01:02:38,374 --> 01:02:40,249
Honey, what will we eat tonight?

1361
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:42,249
You bastard...

1362
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:45,374
Bastard...

1363
01:02:45,374 --> 01:02:48,499
I have witness here, you can't deny.

1364
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:50,166
Who is he?

1365
01:02:50,749 --> 01:02:51,749
Hold it.

1366
01:02:51,749 --> 01:02:53,249
How many husbands do you have?

1367
01:02:53,499 --> 01:02:55,249
How can you ask in this way?

1368
01:02:55,332 --> 01:02:58,124
He is not the dad of Yam Kau Kee whom I saw.

1369
01:02:58,957 --> 01:03:00,749
Who is coming?

1370
01:03:00,957 --> 01:03:01,916
Mom.

1371
01:03:02,874 --> 01:03:04,166
That's him.

1372
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:04,999
Bitch!

1373
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:05,957
Sister?

1374
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:06,916
Bitch sister?

1375
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,791
He is the dad of Yam Kau Kee.

1376
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:10,374
Kau Kee's dad?

1377
01:03:12,457 --> 01:03:14,332
Bastard, stop going, come here!

1378
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:18,666
OK, I will tell you the truth.

1379
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:23,041
You draw the comics.

1380
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:24,166
That's shit!

1381
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:25,374
Shit!

1382
01:03:25,374 --> 01:03:26,541
Follow me back home.

1383
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:27,457
Sister!

1384
01:03:27,457 --> 01:03:29,457
Hold it, don't call me sister.

1385
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:31,041
Don't bother my sister again.

1386
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,249
I wll call the police to arrest you.

1387
01:03:32,249 --> 01:03:33,332
Go

1388
01:03:33,832 --> 01:03:35,041
Sorry.

1389
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:36,832
Cousin.

1390
01:03:37,457 --> 01:03:39,332
Don't help me, please go away.

1391
01:03:39,332 --> 01:03:42,124
These presents are given by you.

1392
01:03:42,749 --> 01:03:44,499
Now, it's meaningless to me.

1393
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:45,832
I am now returning it to you.

1394
01:03:45,832 --> 01:03:47,041
Don't be childish.

1395
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:48,624
You wasted much of my time.

1396
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,332
You fooled me!

1397
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:52,666
You are too hard-hearted.

1398
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:56,582
I didn't cheat you.

1399
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,041
Alright, take it as my fault.

1400
01:03:58,041 --> 01:03:59,874
Forget it, let's cut the crap!

1401
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:02,166
It's time for me to wake up.

1402
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:05,124
I will forget the past, let them be history.

1403
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:07,707
Listen...

1404
01:04:07,707 --> 01:04:09,749
Like sister like brother.

1405
01:04:09,749 --> 01:04:11,749
He is cheating you, I am damn sure.

1406
01:04:11,749 --> 01:04:13,957
Wake up now.

1407
01:04:13,957 --> 01:04:15,541
Or you will regret!

1408
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:16,666
Let's go.

1409
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:19,332
Miss, you've just told the words in my mind.

1410
01:04:19,332 --> 01:04:21,541
I've not listened to such pretty voice before!

1411
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:22,124
Thank you

1412
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,791
Let me give you a ride.

1413
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:24,957
No, thinks.

1414
01:04:27,874 --> 01:04:30,291
She is something!

1415
01:04:38,957 --> 01:04:42,166
Bastard, you make me feel shame.

1416
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,707
Do you know? It's a shame!

1417
01:04:43,707 --> 01:04:44,999
I did no fault.

1418
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:45,707
Not shameful.

1419
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:46,749
You still answer back!

1420
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:47,749
Dad.

1421
01:04:47,749 --> 01:04:50,166
I should have scolded you!

1422
01:04:50,166 --> 01:04:51,499
Forget it.

1423
01:04:51,499 --> 01:04:52,957
It's your fault as to be such a mother.

1424
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:53,874
Foon.

1425
01:04:54,082 --> 01:04:55,916
Hold it.

1426
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:57,957
Bastard.

1427
01:04:57,957 --> 01:05:01,457
You bastard,
you are the black sheep of my family!

1428
01:05:01,457 --> 01:05:04,207
You should stop going with that girl.

1429
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:04,999
Or, I will...

1430
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:05,707
And I will...

1431
01:05:05,707 --> 01:05:07,541
Break the relationship with you.

1432
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:10,957
Where are you going?

1433
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,416
Toilet.

1434
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:19,707
I want you two to die and never reincarnate.

1435
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,707
Help...

1436
01:05:29,499 --> 01:05:30,832
Don't panic.

1437
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,124
Go.

1438
01:05:39,499 --> 01:05:40,957
I am here to protect the Saint.

1439
01:05:41,582 --> 01:05:42,374
Yam Kau Kee?

1440
01:05:42,374 --> 01:05:44,249
Stop messing up. Take him away.

1441
01:05:46,624 --> 01:05:48,499
Where can you go?

1442
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,666
Let them go please.

1443
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:53,166
It's not your business!

1444
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,291
- No.
- Get lost.

1445
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:58,874
Don't panic.

1446
01:05:58,874 --> 01:06:00,666
Bite them.

1447
01:06:09,124 --> 01:06:10,207
Thank you!

1448
01:06:13,082 --> 01:06:15,791
It is raised by me.

1449
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17,124
It will protect us.

1450
01:06:18,832 --> 01:06:20,374
In this world.

1451
01:06:21,166 --> 01:06:22,499
Only love is great.

1452
01:06:42,582 --> 01:06:43,541
Color.

1453
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:44,666
Hurry.

1454
01:07:04,332 --> 01:07:05,582
Yam Kau Kwai...

1455
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:07,166
Yam Kaw Kwai...

1456
01:07:07,832 --> 01:07:10,499
I want to talk to you.

1457
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,916
How dare you tease me?

1458
01:07:25,749 --> 01:07:27,499
Happy ending? Never.

1459
01:07:27,499 --> 01:07:28,582
I will show you another ending.

1460
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:38,874
You will be in deep shit now.

1461
01:07:38,874 --> 01:07:40,457
How dare you court my sister!

1462
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:42,916
Go to hell...You deserve it.

1463
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:46,874
Sorry sir.

1464
01:07:46,874 --> 01:07:49,416
I'm art teacher,
I thought I was attending a lesson.

1465
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:51,166
Sorry.

1466
01:07:51,624 --> 01:07:52,707
Hi

1467
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:54,166
You scared me.

1468
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,207
What a coincidence.

1469
01:07:55,207 --> 01:07:57,291
- Coincidence?
- Right, I work nearby.

1470
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:58,874
I saw you when I was crossing the road.

1471
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,707
I feel so happy to see you.

1472
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,332
Go on.

1473
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:05,041
We met in Kau Ann's home, claim it coincidence.

1474
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:06,249
But this time,

1475
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,499
I think it's destiny.

1476
01:08:07,582 --> 01:08:08,832
You believe in destiny?

1477
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:10,666
Don't you think I am innocent?

1478
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,332
I have to hold a meeting in the morning.

1479
01:08:12,332 --> 01:08:14,457
But if you are willing
to have a breakfast with me.

1480
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:15,666
I lost appetite after seeing you.

1481
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:16,624
Never mind.

1482
01:08:16,624 --> 01:08:19,124
When you feel hungry, just give me a chance.

1483
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,582
Remember,

1484
01:08:20,582 --> 01:08:22,749
I am waiting for you...

1485
01:08:23,207 --> 01:08:24,624
Ling Ling.

1486
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:31,207
You are nonsense & disgusting.

1487
01:08:33,124 --> 01:08:34,457
Destiny?

1488
01:08:46,291 --> 01:08:47,666
If there is destiny,

1489
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,457
I will count three, the come up

1490
01:08:49,457 --> 01:08:51,207
One two three.

1491
01:08:54,499 --> 01:08:55,999
I am sure you would miss it.

1492
01:09:00,582 --> 01:09:01,916
Remember,

1493
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,791
I am waiting for you "Lin"

1494
01:09:04,249 --> 01:09:05,791
I mean phone call.

1495
01:09:10,124 --> 01:09:11,332
Who are you looking for?

1496
01:09:11,832 --> 01:09:13,082
Is Roberto here?

1497
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,457
Roberto...Roberto...

1498
01:09:19,374 --> 01:09:20,332
He is my friend

1499
01:09:20,332 --> 01:09:20,957
How is it?

1500
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,124
I have something urgent to seek for your help

1501
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:23,166
Come in.

1502
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:27,207
George wants to go for a trip with Yuet Yung.

1503
01:09:27,207 --> 01:09:27,916
You know, when they are abroad.

1504
01:09:27,916 --> 01:09:29,457
Two will be in one room.

1505
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:30,416
He can do whatever he wants.

1506
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,666
She want me to
take care of baby so she won't worry.

1507
01:09:32,666 --> 01:09:34,332
Think something for me.

1508
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:38,082
A woman comes to look for Roberto.

1509
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:39,374
Really!

1510
01:09:39,916 --> 01:09:41,707
Other than lustful, he is so wise.

1511
01:09:41,707 --> 01:09:42,707
He has no weak point.

1512
01:09:42,707 --> 01:09:44,582
That's his weak point.

1513
01:09:44,582 --> 01:09:45,541
Your girlfriend?

1514
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:46,749
Your brother.

1515
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:47,541
Hello, Miss Big Tits.

1516
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,082
I am not woman.

1517
01:09:49,082 --> 01:09:50,082
I am your brother.

1518
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:52,374
I did study stage make up in university.

1519
01:09:58,082 --> 01:09:59,707
You are so ugly.

1520
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:03,832
Eat this.

1521
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,416
It's nutritious.

1522
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:08,124
Here comes the soup.

1523
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:11,291
I am sorry.

1524
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,291
Sharon.

1525
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,166
I am sorry.

1526
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:16,874
Let me wash it for you.

1527
01:10:16,874 --> 01:10:18,207
Go and wash it.

1528
01:10:18,832 --> 01:10:20,041
You've dirtied your trousers.

1529
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,791
Kiss me as compensation.

1530
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:23,249
Telephone book.

1531
01:10:28,416 --> 01:10:30,166
Who is his mistress?

1532
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:32,082
Just call all women.

1533
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:36,291
Hello, Masy

1534
01:10:36,374 --> 01:10:38,374
I'm George.

1535
01:10:38,457 --> 01:10:41,957
See you tonight in the
Japanese restaurant at 8pm

1536

01:10:45,332 --> 01:10:47,082
Mimi.

1538
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,082
- Yuet yung
- Why are you free tonight.

1539
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,332
Because I have a date with my girlfriend.

1540
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:56,332
I have to free.

1541
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:58,999
- A date with you?
- Boss, Boss,

1542
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:00,374
Have a seat.

1543
01:11:01,999 --> 01:11:03,791
Welcome.

1544
01:11:05,832 --> 01:11:07,666
Why are you here?

1545
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:11,124
You dated me. No secret.

1546
01:11:11,124 --> 01:11:12,874
Any surprise?

1547
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:14,874
Haven't you got any seat?

1548
01:11:14,874 --> 01:11:16,582
Let me introduce.

1549
01:11:16,582 --> 01:11:18,707
Yuet Yung, Vivian.

1550
01:11:21,582 --> 01:11:23,457
She is my cousin.

1551
01:11:24,332 --> 01:11:25,999
Welcome.

1552
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:30,332
You jerk.

1553
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:32,249
You called me at last.

1554
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,332
Take a seat.

1555
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:37,624
George, who is she?

1556
01:11:39,916 --> 01:11:42,249
My client, I've just fixed her devoice.

1557
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:44,499
Welcome.

1558
01:11:44,499 --> 01:11:46,666
Hello George. Honey.

1559
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:48,707
This is my treat.

1560
01:11:48,707 --> 01:11:50,207
You find your own seat.

1561
01:11:50,207 --> 01:11:52,207
Yuet Yung, do you have 4 separate tables?

1562
01:11:54,999 --> 01:11:57,416
See, so many girlfriends.

1563
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,832
Let see how he handles it.

1564
01:11:58,999 --> 01:12:00,666
He has various kinds of girlfriends.

1565
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:01,749
See this one.

1566
01:12:02,999 --> 01:12:04,291
Indian.

1567
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:05,749
You should have racial discrimination.

1568
01:12:05,749 --> 01:12:06,332
Right.

1569
01:12:06,332 --> 01:12:08,416
Right, I've to go in and join them.

1570
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:10,999
Cheers!

1571
01:12:14,207 --> 01:12:15,416
Jesus Christ

1572
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,957
Super Star

1573
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:19,082
George, who are they?

1574
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:20,082
I am asking you!

1575
01:12:20,166 --> 01:12:21,332
I am asking who they are

1576
01:12:21,332 --> 01:12:22,291
Shut up!

1577
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,249
George, you are so bad.

1578
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:26,249
You wolf, how many women so you have?

1579
01:12:26,416 --> 01:12:28,166
God bless you all.

1580
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:31,082
Yuet Yung, please listen to me.

1581
01:12:31,082 --> 01:12:32,999
They are all your relatives, I know.

1582
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:34,457
George.

1583
01:12:35,082 --> 01:12:37,582
You flattered the sister too.

1584
01:12:37,582 --> 01:12:39,624
She is my relative.

1585
01:12:39,624 --> 01:12:41,749
You want to give me a surprise.

1586
01:12:41,749 --> 01:12:42,791
Thank God.

1587
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,124
I've begged for ten years.

1588
01:12:44,124 --> 01:12:46,291
Finally you're willing to donate to us.

1589
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:48,916
Thank God.

1590
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:51,749
I must be trapped, who did it?

1591
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:56,041
You did it, right?

1592
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:58,332
You wolf, you have been disclosed!

1593
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,291
Bitch, I didn't harm you at all.

1594
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:02,207
Why did you trap me?

1595
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,124
You always ruin other's family.

1596
01:13:04,124 --> 01:13:06,207
You will take advantage of Yuet Yung,
not that easy.

1597
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:07,832
Sharon, you shouldn't say such thing.

1598
01:13:07,832 --> 01:13:09,541
You are fired!

1599
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:10,582
Disappear!

1600
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,874
How can you fire me?

1601
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:14,749
I am her fiancé!

1602
01:13:14,749 --> 01:13:15,999
But I am her husband.

1603
01:13:19,582 --> 01:13:21,791
It's you!

1604
01:13:21,791 --> 01:13:22,624
Yuet Yung!

1605
01:13:22,624 --> 01:13:24,166
You hurt me once.

1606
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,707
And you cheated me again.

1607
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:27,707
Honey, in fact ll...

1608
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:30,457
At least, I still have gained my dignity.

1609
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:31,749
It's like wearing a clothe.

1610
01:13:31,749 --> 01:13:34,457
But this time you take all off from me.

1611
01:13:34,457 --> 01:13:36,416
Yam Kau Ful!

1612
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,291
Honey...

1613
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:47,791
Cry?

1614
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:51,374
Honey...Honey!

1615
01:13:51,374 --> 01:13:53,874
Run.

1616
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:56,624
Yuet Yung, please forgive me.

1617
01:13:56,624 --> 01:13:57,499
Don't follow me.

1618
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,791
Don't follow me.

1619
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:02,791
You always wear a mask.

1620
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:06,166
You wear a mask to social.

1621
01:14:06,166 --> 01:14:08,707
You wear a mask to face your wife.

1622
01:14:08,707 --> 01:14:12,207
Sister-in-law,
I did help him to make that mask.

1623
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:14,416
She doesn't mean that.

1624
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:17,499
Don't just stick to your business.

1625
01:14:17,749 --> 01:14:19,457
Please just don't care about your dad.

1626
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:22,082
I am your wife!

1627
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,249
I need your care too!

1628
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:26,624
I need your respect too

1629
01:14:28,957 --> 01:14:30,082
Move please.

1630
01:14:32,332 --> 01:14:33,416
Brother.

1631
01:14:35,332 --> 01:14:37,082
Where is he going?

1632
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:39,916
He won't forgive himself.

1633
01:14:41,249 --> 01:14:43,166
Let's have a drink.

1634
01:14:45,541 --> 01:14:46,749
Love...

1635
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,499
It's troublesome to fall in love.

1636
01:14:48,499 --> 01:14:50,166
Not exactly.

1637
01:14:51,124 --> 01:14:52,332
Have you ever fallen in love.

1638
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:53,582
How about you?

1639
01:14:53,582 --> 01:14:54,749
I raised the question first.

1640
01:14:54,749 --> 01:14:56,374
I may not answer you.

1641
01:14:56,374 --> 01:14:57,624
You are escaping from love.

1642
01:14:57,957 --> 01:14:59,082
I know.

1643
01:14:59,957 --> 01:15:02,291
It's great responsibility to love the others.

1644
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,832
See who is your another half.

1645
01:15:07,332 --> 01:15:08,999
I know I won't be a good husband.

1646
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:10,624
But you will be a good lover.

1647
01:15:10,749 --> 01:15:12,041
I know.

1648
01:15:13,332 --> 01:15:14,666
I am sure.

1649
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:16,624
If you stay with me.

1650
01:15:16,624 --> 01:15:18,332
You will be very happy.

1651
01:15:21,082 --> 01:15:22,374
No cigarettes.

1652
01:15:23,166 --> 01:15:24,374
Please give me a pack of cigarettes.

1653
01:15:24,374 --> 01:15:25,374
Pretty lady.

1654
01:15:25,374 --> 01:15:26,707
Would you like a dance?

1655
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:28,499
Yeah!

1656
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,166
You are so sexy.

1657
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,207
I am not interested in you.

1658
01:15:42,707 --> 01:15:44,249
Excuse me, we're leaving.

1659
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,999
What's going on?

1660
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,499
Who will you look like when you get old?

1661
01:15:49,499 --> 01:15:52,291
I must be like Lin Chin Xia.

1662
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:54,832
No. You are like plum.

1663
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:57,291
A plum!

1664
01:15:59,457 --> 01:16:00,749
To bed.

1665
01:16:02,374 --> 01:16:03,332
Not here.

1666
01:16:03,332 --> 01:16:05,582
At the back.

1667
01:16:10,124 --> 01:16:12,374
Here's your clothing.

1668
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:19,916
Not suitable for children.

1669
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:30,332
You are courting my sister.

1670
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:34,166
You just deny it. Lidida.

1671
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:38,457
You shouldn't say such thing with me.

1672
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:40,541
You are well planned.

1673
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:42,291
Bravo!

1674
01:16:49,332 --> 01:16:51,082
Why...

1675
01:16:51,582 --> 01:16:54,666
Why? Changed.

1676
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,874
Saint, we are safe.

1677
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:14,707
We are safe!

1678
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:18,457
You look so awful!

1679
01:17:25,832 --> 01:17:28,874
Help.

1680
01:17:35,082 --> 01:17:36,999
Now, you are helpless.

1681
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:39,999
You'd better listen to me.

1682
01:17:39,999 --> 01:17:42,249
Otherwise.

1683
01:17:42,332 --> 01:17:44,332
You said you love me, Saint.

1684
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:46,416
Saint?

1685
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:48,749
Now I am Jurassic Wolf.

1686
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,457
Together with them.

1687
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,374
We are the lustful family.

1688
01:17:52,374 --> 01:17:54,999
Strip her.

1689
01:17:55,499 --> 01:17:59,541
Help.

1690
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:01,957
In this world.

1691
01:18:02,207 --> 01:18:04,416
I am the most nasty Saint!

1692
01:18:09,249 --> 01:18:10,957
I've told you, he is nasty.

1693
01:18:10,957 --> 01:18:11,874
You look!

1694
01:18:11,874 --> 01:18:13,166
See his pictures, so bad!

1695
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,041
That's what in his mind.

1696
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:17,874
Sau...

1697
01:18:17,874 --> 01:18:19,249
Leave me alone.

1698
01:18:19,541 --> 01:18:21,791
I'm innocent...

1699
01:18:21,957 --> 01:18:22,791
Go.

1700
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:23,999
My sister won't bother you!

1701
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,041
Forget it!

1702
01:18:25,041 --> 01:18:26,957
I'm...

1703
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:28,791
Sau...

1704
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:51,249
I don't know what to say.

1705
01:18:51,957 --> 01:18:53,124
Brother.

1706
01:18:56,582 --> 01:18:58,749
You make me sick.

1707
01:18:58,749 --> 01:19:00,082
You look like sick.

1708
01:19:00,082 --> 01:19:01,957
You like dead fishes.

1709
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:05,541
Ann, take his win away.

1710
01:19:06,832 --> 01:19:08,499
Don't drink anymore!

1711
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,291
You will change to be dead fist too.

1712
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:17,291
So noisy.

1713
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:18,666
Do you want to rebel?

1714
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,041
You make me sick!

1715
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:22,541
Again...

1716
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,874
Shut up!

1717
01:19:25,624 --> 01:19:27,374
I want to write calligraphy.

1718
01:19:28,916 --> 01:19:30,791
Today is New Year eve.

1719
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:32,124
Tomorrow will be the 1st day of Lunar New Year.

1720
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:33,582
Would you please shut up?

1721
01:19:33,582 --> 01:19:35,541
Everyone will be happy to enjoy new year eve.

1722
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:37,749
What wrong did I do in my previous life?

1723
01:19:37,749 --> 01:19:39,957
See, my daughter was changed too.

1724
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,707
Dad, I can tolerate no more.

1725
01:19:41,707 --> 01:19:43,041
It's your fault. You made us become like this.

1726
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:45,416
Fu becomes coward cos' you always scold him.

1727
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:46,374
He lost his wife too.

1728
01:19:46,374 --> 01:19:48,041
And brother Kawi.

1729
01:19:48,041 --> 01:19:49,791
He always stays in his room drawing comics.

1730
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:51,832
He just wants to stay away from you.

1731
01:19:51,832 --> 01:19:53,541
Ann said is correct.

1732
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:55,332
I am going to support you!

1733
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,041
How dare you!

1734
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,207
Why did I go to France?

1735
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,582
I don't want to become another coward.

1736
01:19:59,582 --> 01:20:01,124
I want to seek for myself.

1737
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,999
Back to myself.

1738
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:05,624
Isn't it taught by the French rascal?

1739
01:20:05,624 --> 01:20:06,624
I didn't teach her such thing.

1740
01:20:11,832 --> 01:20:13,166
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1741
01:20:13,582 --> 01:20:16,291
I've brought trouble to you.

1742
01:20:17,874 --> 01:20:19,041
I'd better go back to France

1743
01:20:19,624 --> 01:20:20,832
Goodbye.

1744
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:22,041
Roberto.

1745
01:20:23,374 --> 01:20:24,749
Are you leaving like this?

1746
01:20:27,249 --> 01:20:28,207
I think,

1747
01:20:28,207 --> 01:20:29,666
it will be better to you all

1748
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,541
Take care.

1749
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:39,082
You too.

1750
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:44,541
Rich family

1751
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:47,582
Rich family

1752
01:20:54,207 --> 01:20:57,374
What's the meaning of Rich family?

1753
01:20:57,457 --> 01:21:00,166
If there is always quarrel,

1754
01:21:00,457 --> 01:21:02,624
How can you claim your home sweet?

1755
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,374
You should treasure your family

1756
01:21:05,832 --> 01:21:09,082
Or, you will regret! Shit!

1757
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:11,624
Regret?!

1758
01:21:28,874 --> 01:21:30,207
You're in time.

1759
01:21:31,624 --> 01:21:32,666
You...

1760
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,666
Don't come back...

1761
01:21:34,666 --> 01:21:35,916
Hong Kong.

1762
01:21:37,207 --> 01:21:39,457
I've made so many mistakes,

1763
01:21:39,457 --> 01:21:43,082
Even Kau Kee thinks that
I am courting his sister.

1764
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:45,582
Aren't you.

1765
01:21:46,374 --> 01:21:48,041
See.

1766
01:21:49,082 --> 01:21:51,124
Your dad hates me so much!

1767
01:21:52,082 --> 01:21:53,291
Dad

1768
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,207
Forget about him.

1769
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:56,832
I know

1770
01:21:57,999 --> 01:21:59,332
By the way,

1771
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,541
You have some misunderstanding
with your girlfriend.

1772
01:22:03,582 --> 01:22:05,457
If she is good.

1773
01:22:05,457 --> 01:22:06,957
Don't give her up easily.

1774
01:22:07,124 --> 01:22:08,499
Go on.

1775
01:22:14,457 --> 01:22:16,082
Kau Ann.

1776
01:22:16,457 --> 01:22:17,957
Good girl.

1777
01:22:31,082 --> 01:22:32,874
- I am not looking for you.
- How dare you!

1778
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,541
How dare you!

1779
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:38,791
Because I love Sau Kit.

1780
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:39,624
So I have guts.

1781
01:22:39,624 --> 01:22:40,457
I have guts,

1782
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:41,749
Because I love Sau Kit.

1783
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:42,832
You spoke fluently.

1784
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:44,249
I can't live without Sau Kit.

1785
01:22:44,249 --> 01:22:45,916
She gives me faith.

1786
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:46,582
In this world,

1787
01:22:46,582 --> 01:22:48,999
she is the one who understands me most.

1788
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:50,666
She loves me unconditionally.

1789
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:51,749
I have to marry her.

1790
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:53,416
I don't fear any obstructions.

1791
01:22:58,999 --> 01:23:00,499
Sau Kit.

1792
01:23:02,874 --> 01:23:03,707
I love you

1793
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:07,916
You could say that complete sentence!

1794
01:23:09,957 --> 01:23:11,166
Not only saying.

1795
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:12,332
I want to do it.

1796
01:23:12,499 --> 01:23:13,624
Let's go.

1797
01:23:13,749 --> 01:23:15,999
Don't follow him.

1798
01:23:15,999 --> 01:23:17,582
If you leave, don't ever come back.

1799
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:18,916
Don't cal me sister.

1800
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,207
It's OK, sister.

1801
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:28,374
The girl is so poor to have no daddy.

1802
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,082
In fact you shouldn't blame him.

1803
01:23:33,457 --> 01:23:35,166
I did suggest the tricks.

1804
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:38,124
You just want to tell me such things?

1805
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:39,874
Although we meet for the first time.

1806
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:43,207
To be polite, I have to say good bye to you.

1807
01:23:43,874 --> 01:23:45,541
Because I have to go back to France tonight.

1808
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:47,749
My sister-in-law...

1809
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:50,124
Doesn't Ann miss you?

1810
01:23:53,999 --> 01:23:56,249
In face, your husband
is still loving you so much

1811
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,416
Really?

1812
01:24:01,582 --> 01:24:02,832
Don't you agree?

1813
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:07,207
You are persuading me to treasure it.

1814
01:24:07,874 --> 01:24:09,874
Why do you give up that easily?

1815
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:15,582
See you.

1816
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:35,166
May I sit down?

1817
01:24:36,207 --> 01:24:37,332
What a coincidence?

1818
01:24:37,332 --> 01:24:39,166
I've tailed you.

1819
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:40,957
Why?

1820
01:24:40,957 --> 01:24:42,291
I want to woo you.

1821
01:24:43,957 --> 01:24:45,082
You are too straight forward.

1822
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:46,916
This is my merit.

1823
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,832
It's a waste of time to guess.

1824
01:24:48,957 --> 01:24:50,749
I can't afford wasting time, I am getting old.

1825
01:24:51,457 --> 01:24:53,124
Me too.

1826
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:54,957
Are you willing to be courted by me?

1827
01:24:56,249 --> 01:24:58,124
Cheap adjective.

1828
01:24:58,666 --> 01:24:59,874
But.

1829
01:25:00,582 --> 01:25:01,916
I'll accept it.

1830
01:25:04,916 --> 01:25:08,416
But why are you nicknamed "Plain Coffee"?

1831
01:25:08,874 --> 01:25:11,124
I see, you love drinking plain coffee.

1832
01:25:11,999 --> 01:25:13,332
I think so.

1833
01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:15,707
Please give me another plain coffee.

1834
01:25:15,707 --> 01:25:17,916
Plain coffee.

1835
01:25:19,791 --> 01:25:21,082
In fact...

1836
01:25:22,124 --> 01:25:23,666
In fact...

1837
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:25,082
I do have it.

1838
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:28,416
I know,

1839
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,999
They are obvious.

1840
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:41,207
Come on, let's have the family union dinner.

1841
01:25:41,916 --> 01:25:44,082
Grandpa has no appetite.

1842
01:25:44,374 --> 01:25:45,624
Forget about him.

1843
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:03,332
Mom, what are you doing?

1844
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:06,374
For a woman.

1845
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:09,749
Why makes her to be willing
to cook all day in kitchen.

1846
01:26:10,124 --> 01:26:11,457
Cook daily.

1847
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:12,957
And not even any complaint.

1848
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:17,041
Just want to cook for her beloved family.

1849
01:26:17,707 --> 01:26:19,541
Husband and kids.

1850
01:26:20,832 --> 01:26:22,999
To make them happy.

1851
01:26:24,832 --> 01:26:27,166
But all of you look so sad.

1852
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:30,499
This family union dinner...

1853
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:33,249
It's meaningless at all.

1854
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:37,541
We have gap with dad, he is so out-dated.

1855
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:39,749
We can communicate.

1856
01:26:44,457 --> 01:26:46,291
Open the door first.

1857
01:26:57,457 --> 01:26:59,832
She doesn't mean to complain against you.

1858
01:27:00,749 --> 01:27:03,124
She is right,

1859
01:27:07,041 --> 01:27:08,457
- Brother.
- Miss Ho.

1860
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:11,332
- Mom.
- You're back.

1861
01:27:12,374 --> 01:27:14,249
We come back to have dinner.

1862
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:15,999
Sorry, we are late.

1863
01:27:15,999 --> 01:27:17,124
Not at all.

1864
01:27:17,124 --> 01:27:18,916
Come and sit.

1865
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:25,249
Kwali, serve vegetable to Miss Ho.

1866
01:27:25,249 --> 01:27:26,999
Uncle, you may call me Sau Kit.

1867
01:27:26,999 --> 01:27:28,874
Sau Kit, just take it as your home.

1868
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:30,416
Just like a family.

1869
01:27:32,707 --> 01:27:34,166
It must be the God of Fortune for red pocket.

1870
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,624
Give him a red pocket.

1871
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:37,291
I'm going too.

1872
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:39,707
