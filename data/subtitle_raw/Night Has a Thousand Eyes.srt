1
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:43,173
Why did you stop me?

2
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,174
Why?

3
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,795
It's all right, Jean.
Everything is all right.

4
00:02:46,915 --> 00:02:48,835
Elliott, why didn't you let me go?

5
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,154
I can't face it...

6
00:02:53,636 --> 00:02:55,315
Like a thousand eyes.

7
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:58,315
Watching.

8
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,156
The stars?

9
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,918
Oh, Elliott, I'm so frightened!
I'm so frightened!

10
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,040
Thank you.

11
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:19,559
You're just upset about your father.

12
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,582
It's more than that, it's...

13
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:24,283
Darling, the stars can't hurt you.

14
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:25,484
They keep watching.

15
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,844
I said nothing is going to hurt you.

16
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,043
How did you know where I was?

17
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:32,064
Well...

18
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:35,166
For one thing... your car.

19
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:39,485
I didn't tell anyone where I was going.

20
00:03:42,126 --> 00:03:45,488
I was driving around,
and like they kept looking down

21
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,647
hardly I couldn't stand them any longer.

22
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,486
Elliott, Â¿how did you know?

23
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,369
I'll tell you all about it.
First, let's have some coffee.

24
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,167
When did you last eat?

25
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,329
- Breakfast, I think.
- Then, a coffee and an omelette.

26
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,512
Oh, here's your handbag...

27
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,253
and your watch.

28
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:16,133
At least, I made it stop.
They kept right on.

29
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,856
- Could we have the top up?
- Of course.

30
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,740
Good evening.

31
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,622
- That's how you know.
- Would you sit down?

32
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,162
I'll order some coffee and an omelette.
Waiter!

33
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,623
- You needen't bother.
- Why not?

34
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,582
Omelette for mistress.

35
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:07,185
I think you have quite a bit of
explaining to do, Mr. Triton.

36
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:07,986
Yes, I know.

37
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,224
- To the police.
- If you like...

38
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:12,264
Elliott, you don't know
what you're talking about.

39
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,426
I know a confidence racket
when I see one.

40
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,707
Mr. Triton has been trying to help me.

41
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,609
By scaring you into suicide?

42
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,510
Jean, I've been away, but don't forget
I saw all from the start.

43
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:24,549
I don't blame you for being
suspicious, Mr. Carson.

44
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:29,589
The facts... well, they're incredible
if they are facts.

45
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,591
I don't know myself.

46
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,194
But I would like to convince you that I
have noticed I had hurted Miss Courtland,

47
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,910
And what you'd even doing to her?

48
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,613
He told me I was to die soon.
At night. Under the stars.

49
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,754
And you believed that?

50
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,913
How did you happen to go to the
switchyard tonight?

51
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,276
He sent me, naturally.

52
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:53,875
How did he know, when I didn't myself?

53
00:05:55,474 --> 00:06:00,956
Well, I suppose hypnotism, suggestion,
some kind of a trick.

54
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:03,840
- I believe you are an oil geologist.
- I am.

55
00:06:05,117 --> 00:06:08,958
Would... would you be willing to listen
with the open mind of a scientist

56
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,439
given so doing you might
help Miss Courtland?

57
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:14,399
Provided I'm free to go to
the police afterwards...

58
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,600
I've no strings to touch.

59
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm listening.

60
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:21,442
I...

61
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,443
I suppose most people are looking back

62
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:29,603
and see the exact point where
lives were touched by destiny.

63
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:33,885
A new job, an unexpected inheritance,
a quick decision...

64
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,085
But I can't.

65
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:41,924
My destiny came upon me imperceptibly.

66
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:47,827
Like the first thin drops of rain are
noticed on a window pane.

67
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:53,667
It wasn't until the third, or fourth,
or... fifth drop

68
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:58,708
that I became aware of this
rain that was to engulf my life.

69
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,591
I remember the date:
August 3rd, 1928.

70
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,694
We were playing a one-night stand

71
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:12,550
in a small town in Louisiana: Glenberry.

72
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:15,593
<i>Triton, the Mental Wizard
and Company.</i>

73
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,875
<i>Three 12 minutes shows a day,
sandwiched with</i>

74
00:07:18,094 --> 00:07:21,433
<i>Toto and his Stumbling Dogs,
and a troupe of acrobats.</i>

75
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:24,477
<i>The act deserved better billing.</i>

76
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:27,914
<i>It was a phoney, of course, like
most mind reading acts, but</i>

77
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,516
<i>it was a first class phoney, if I do
say so myself.</i>

78
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:33,358
<i>Nobody knew how we did it.</i>

79
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:36,020
<i>It was the late show, 11:37.</i>

80
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,096
<i>Jenny was collecting the envelopes
with the usual familiar questions.</i>

81
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:46,098
<i>"Will I take a trip?" "Is my husband
unfaithful?" "Should I marry my boyfriend?"</i>

82
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,820
<i>I was winding up my spiel.</i>

83
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,522
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
All through the ages,

84
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:52,981
there have been men
with mysterious gifts,

85
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:54,383
men with inner eyes

86
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:58,380
which enable 'em to pierce the veils that
hide the tomorrows of ordinary mortals.

87
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,624
What is this gift?
Frankly, I don't know.

88
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,645
But the visions come,

89
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:10,046
sometimes cloudy, sometimes clear.
Strange visions.

90
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:12,987
- Have you the questions, Jenny?
- Yes, sir.

91
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,265
Would you check the envelopes, please?

92
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:18,026
You'll notice, ladies and gentlemen
that the envelopes are never touched

93
00:08:18,146 --> 00:08:20,467
from the time that you sealed them
until they are placed inside the globe.

94
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,190
I won't touch them myself.

95
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,348
From where I stand, I should endeavour
to read the contents of each envelope

96
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:29,189
and identify the person who wrote it.

97
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,710
When I call the name,

98
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,911
would that person, please,
raise his or her hand?

99
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:37,511
This will enable me
to strengthen the contact.

100
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:41,451
And I'd like for everyone to refrain
from thinking

101
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:43,752
of anything that could
possibly disrupt me.

102
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,873
Try to keep your minds blank.

103
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:50,315
Now, if I might have a little
faint music.

104
00:08:54,675 --> 00:09:03,517
I sense a name. A lady's name.
It's Bryant, no... Byers.

105
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:07,717
Spelt B-y-e-r-s.

106
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:10,879
She lives on Revere Street.

107
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:16,138
Number 1-4-7.

108
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:17,540
What... That's me!

109
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,799
You... gave your maiden name

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,300
inside the envelope which remains
unopened and untouched in the globe.

111
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:30,161
Your maiden name was... Grayson.

112
00:09:31,022 --> 00:09:34,743
You are very pretty, Miss Grayson
and you came to the city from Virginia.

113
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:38,883
Also you asked a question.
You...

114
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,384
you asked...

115
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:43,246
"When will my mother-in-law go home?"

116
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:47,266
Well, not I am really prognosticate
in domestic affairs,

117
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:50,566
but I believe that I can say pretty
safe that she will leave very soon.

118
00:09:52,309 --> 00:09:55,848
And... I'm concentrating
on another envelope.

119
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,109
Man's handwriting, formed, angular.

120
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:06,570
The name is Scottish...
...it's Angus...

121
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:11,092
MacDougal! Angus MacDougal,
Aberdeen, Scotland!

122
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,753
No, no. Don't tell me.
Just concentrate in silence.

123
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:20,374
You asked a question,
a business question.

124
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:21,375
Aye.

125
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:28,795
You own a store...
in some South Street.

126
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,036
I can't quite make it out.

127
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:40,139
I have it!
It's a woollen store!

128
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,897
And your question is about the store.
Will it prosper?

129
00:10:44,498 --> 00:10:47,700
Well, I'll try to answer that
question, sir. I feel that...

130
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,141
There are disrupting thoughts connected
to someone here tonight.

131
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:01,942
Someone in a white hat with... daisies.

132
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:04,504
That's you.

133
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:09,283
Madam, go home! Your little boy
is in trouble, in danger.

134
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,684
You must go home at once!

135
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,387
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
Where was I?

136
00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:25,729
Oh, yes... uh...

137
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,610
MacDougal, prosperity, sir.

138
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:32,490
You'll own another woollen store
in a neighbouring city.

139
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,829
and they both will go well.

140
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:40,392
And now, I... I have a question
of another intimate nature.

141
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,111
I... uh... all was through me
on the Scotch one.

142
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:50,553
He was a Scotch bud, all right,

143
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:52,314
but how's I'd know that
he had a woollen store?

144
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:53,954
I played "Mary had a little lamb".

145
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,914
Sure, sure, and I almost said
that he was a butcher.

146
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:57,474
I bet you think I am a
first class guesser.

147
00:11:57,713 --> 00:11:58,916
That's what you were doing
with that woman?

148
00:11:58,956 --> 00:11:59,996
What woman?

149
00:12:00,077 --> 00:12:01,816
The one you scared the daylights out of.

150
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:04,515
- Oh, her...
- Why did you do that, Johnny?

151
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,395
I don't know. Sort of just popped into
my head. Ready, baby?

152
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,537
Already. Johnny, what made it pop
into your head?

153
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,018
Oh, how do I know?
Just came.

154
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,719
It won't hurt the dame to go.
Didn't want to be up so late anyway.

155
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,159
Now, look..

156
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,042
What we all need is a big steak dinner
with maybe a bottle of wine and some beer.

157
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:19,999
Now, what do you say?

158
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,159
- Who's gonna pick up the tab?
- What are you talking about?

159
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
- Bonsoir, mademoiselle.
- Good night.

160
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,219
Maybe Jenny could put the bite on him.

161
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:28,762
No, no, no. I draw the line
on eating with poodles.

162
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:31,262
What happened with the
fifty we got tonight?

163
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:32,763
We had a 20-buck for gas when hit town.

164
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:36,324
Bus fares to New Orleans, hotel bills,
breakfast, to mention a few items..

165
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:39,263
Well, sort of Jenny has been
elected cook again.

166
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,423
But I don't mind.
It's good practice.

167
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:43,484
- How much have we got left?
- 22,65.

168
00:12:43,703 --> 00:12:44,824
Give me two bucks.

169
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:47,246
That's for the license, baby.

170
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,989
Our swing aroung the Middle West
will pay for the ring.

171
00:12:50,105 --> 00:12:51,926
There are rings in dime stores, Johnny.

172
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:55,087
No, no, no.
My wife has gotta start off marriage in style.

173
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,588
Come on, let's be going.

174
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:00,148
Mr. Triton, there's a woman
here to see you.

175
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,689
We are so grateful!
He found some matches.

176
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:05,210
I can't imagine where.
And the bed was on fire.

177
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,291
- He was pretty badly burned.
- I'm sorry.

178
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,550
He's in the hospital
He will be all right, won't he?

179
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:16,972
I don't know.

180
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:19,772
That's what I told you, Court, those
things just pop into my head.

181
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,174
The first one that meant
anything was tonight.

182
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:23,456
Listen, after the show on Arkon,

183
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,595
I checked on the guy you warned
not to drive home.

184
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,396
Yeah?

185
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:28,215
He was in the hospital with
a broken collar bone.

186
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:29,616
His car toppled from a bridge.

187
00:13:30,754 --> 00:13:32,658
You are as punch-drunk as I am.

188
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:33,854
Look...

189
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:37,155
Let's lay off this so called occult
stuff, and concentrate on the act.

190
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:39,135
Stand a little work.

191
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,219
You know? I've been thinking
Jenny ought to have a routine.

192
00:13:42,837 --> 00:13:45,080
Maybe a song just as I start
to answer the questions.

193
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,380
Oh, that would be wonderful.

194
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,818
Yeah, they'd think that
you are tipping me off,

195
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,319
but when you finish, I'll go right on.

196
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,100
What do you think, Court?

197
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,041
I think that 10 bucks in Ready Cash
in the fifth of Green Meadows

198
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,359
will do us more good.

199
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,160
No...

200
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:02,282
No, not Ready Cash.
He'll fall, have to be destroyed.

201
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:05,463
Peer Gynt, by two lengths.

202
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,404
Johnny, did that just
pop in you head too?

203
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:14,945
No, no, no...
I was joking, just a gag.

204
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,064
Are you sure?

205
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:18,226
Of course I'm sure. Look,
didn't I tell you to lay off?

206
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:21,287
- Now, what's the big idea?
- Oh, just curious.

207
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,327
I called the hospital.
The kid is gonna pull through.

208
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,188
We called too.

209
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:29,389
- I still think...
- Never mind.

210
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:30,930
- Did you pay the bill?
- No, not yet.

211
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,388
Well, then pay.
Let's grab some lunch. Jenny's hungry.

212
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:35,108
- I know that, but Johnny...
- What?

213
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,189
I don't think we have any money.
Do you think we have?

214
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:40,469
Haven't any money?
What happenned with the 20?

215
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:42,871
- Peer Gynt... at a nose.
- You've done it?

216
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:46,074
What do you know about that?
Every cent we got in the world.

217
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,951
Well, if that isn't the craziest most
harebrained stunt I've ever heard off.

218
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:54,334
You're supposed to be a businessman.
Couldn't you've list a better show?

219
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,794
I can make it up, Johnny.

220
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,275
Oh, sure, sure. In the meantime,
how do we get to New Orleans?

221
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,573
I can always pawn the earrings
my mother left me.

222
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:01,974
No, no no... I wouldn't let you.

223
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,916
Oh, mister, can I see you
a minute, please?

224
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:06,718
Would you mind checking it in fifties?

225
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:09,357
- Checking what?
- The 200 bucks he just won.

226
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:10,758
Rather can you pick horses!

227
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:14,398
Peer Gynt, 10 to 1. What have you got,
second sight or something?

228
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:20,739
Seems odd my being frightened
over the bet on a horse race

229
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,440
when I had all these other things
to be frightened about.

230
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,400
I think it was because it had
touched me this time.

231
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,921
Me and the two people I care most about.

232
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:36,042
Look, this is interesting, but what
has it got to do with Jean?

233
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:40,764
The piano player was
Whitney Courtland, Jean's father.

234
00:15:40,764 --> 00:15:43,565
- And Jenny was...
- My mother.

235
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:48,605
- You were engaged to Jean's mother?
- I loved her very much.

236
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:52,426
- And you didn't know this?
- Dad told me some of it.

237
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:55,167
Yes, but not everything because
he didn't know everything.

238
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,968
- Would you prefer I stop?
- No, please, don't.

239
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:03,167
And on the next month, during our
swing around the West,

240
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,929
half a dozen of the hunches
came through.

241
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,171
Another horse race,
a flyer on wheats,

242
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:09,889
quick stock deals.

243
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,708
Courtland handled the money.
I never touched it.

244
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:15,091
I was becoming more
frightened every day.

245
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:20,813
And I began to have a crazy feeling that
I was making the things come true,

246
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:26,896
like a voodoo sorcerer who kills people
by sticking pins in the doll.

247
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:33,973
I thought of the man with the broken
collar bone, the boy with the matches...

248
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:38,238
Would anything have happened to them
if I had kept quiet?

249
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:44,197
And then one day,
it was a rainy afternoon in Wichita,

250
00:16:44,397 --> 00:16:47,418
as I was leaving the theater
for the hotel,

251
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,420
the answer came.

252
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,099
<i>I've been haggling the
house electrician.</i>

253
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:56,300
<i>I wasn't quite satisfied with the
way he worked the lights to the act</i>

254
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,460
<i>and I was still wondering if he
understood about the baby spot.</i>

255
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,619
- Paper?
- Yes, sure.

256
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,620
Here.

257
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:06,504
Mr. Triton, I've seen your picture
on the poster.

258
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:07,205
Yeah.

259
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:08,302
Can I ask you something?

260
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:10,423
Yes, sure, but come in here,
out of the rain.

261
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:11,724
What do you wanna know?

262
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,503
How is the Saint Louis Cards gonna
make out this year?

263
00:17:14,503 --> 00:17:17,945
Oh, they're gonna be right up on top,
provided their pitching holds up.

264
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:21,166
That's what I say.
Can't you tell me anything else?

265
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,826
- That's the best I can do.
- Oh, thanks anyway.

266
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:27,926
- Hey, son.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:29,947
Be careful today.
Don't cross.

268
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:32,848
Here.

269
00:17:34,069 --> 00:17:37,071
Blow yourself with some tickets
for the show tonight.

270
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:40,671
Gee! Thanks Mr. Triton.
I go call my mom.

271
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:49,393
<i>It had come again.
A hunch or vision or... whatever it was.</i>

272
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:53,314
<i>This time I hadn't spoken.
I kept it to myself.</i>

273
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:05,515
- Telephone in there, mister?
- Yes, sure. What happened?

274
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:08,677
Newsboy. Just been run over.
I'm afraid he's done for.

275
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,479
Johnny, what on earth
have you been doing?

276
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:20,099
Walking.

277
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,319
In this weather!
Why didn't you take a cab?

278
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,820
I wanted to walk.

279
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,440
And catch a dreadful cold, I suppose.
Oh, silly, give me a kiss.

280
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:33,841
What you need is a nice hot cup of tea,
a hot bath and change your clothes.

281
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,563
You'll be fine.

282
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,803
- Why were you walking, Johnny?
- I don't know.

283
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:48,045
- Something is bothering you, isn't it?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

284
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:51,284
You wanna tell me about it?

285
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:57,288
It's some kind of mix-up.
Something just happened.

286
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:58,806
Johnny...

287
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,766
Look at this. Five grand on the cotton deal
and the Western Carbide is up to 70.

288
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,248
We are sitting on top of the world
and the sky's the limit.

289
00:19:05,248 --> 00:19:08,049
I got a new deal, a fellow I met
in the lobby, an oil man.

290
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:11,570
He has an option in a big tract downside
Tulsa: Comanche Hills is called.

291
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,350
He's willing to sell a half interest.
What do you think?

292
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,211
Can you pull out another one of
those hunches, Johnny?

293
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:18,512
Comanche Hills, Oklahoma.

294
00:19:25,314 --> 00:19:26,694
We are all washed up of hunches, Court.

295
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:28,811
- Washed up! What do you mean washed up?
- Just what I said.

296
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,017
Johnny, 23.000 in four weeks,
if we gonna start it.

297
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:32,934
- I know, I know.
- But why? What's got into you?

298
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:35,413
Well, I don't suppose I can explain,
it's something I feel.

299
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,495
Bad luck for all us because...

300
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:40,316
well, because we are fooling around
with something that we oughtn't be.

301
00:19:40,516 --> 00:19:41,377
I'm not afraid.

302
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:43,338
Why you should be if you aren't
the one who was doing it.

303
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:46,297
Well, I mean on it and so is Jenny.
Have you thought about her?

304
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:49,740
Look Johnny, you wanna get married. You
want a home, money in the Bank security,

305
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,860
something you'll never get out
of the show business.

306
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,239
Court, I love Jenny
and I like you.

307
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,840
We've been through a lot.
Never lied, cheated or chiseled.

308
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,900
All has been was the best
for the three of us.

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,321
No matter how it sounds,
I'm still thinking that way.

310
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,141
I know what's the matter with you.
You've got the rainy day blues.

311
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:08,065
Talk to him, Jenny.

312
00:20:08,065 --> 00:20:12,024
I think Johnny is right. I haven't
had a good feeling about this either.

313
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,103
It's scary.

314
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,046
What's scary about making money?

315
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,747
I don't want money.
I just want Johnny.

316
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:24,348
Hello.

317
00:20:24,449 --> 00:20:25,349
Yes.

318
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:28,387
Keep your shirt on.
We'll be right over.

319
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,906
Curtain in 20 minutes.

320
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,986
<i>Curtain in 20 minutes.</i>

321
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:35,870
<i>I had no way of knowing
it was my final curtain.</i>

322
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,188
I am concentrating on a
particular envelope.

323
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:42,289
Young lady's handwriting.

324
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:45,151
She's shy; she's only written
her first name.

325
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:51,772
- It's Agnes. Agnes, where art thou?
- Agnes, he's speaking to you.

326
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:55,193
- Don't be afraid to speak up.
- Here I am, Mr. Triton.

327
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:57,294
Oh, thank you.
Was I right?

328
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:58,311
Yes, sir.

329
00:20:58,311 --> 00:20:59,574
Oh, that's splendid.

330
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:01,553
And now...

331
00:21:02,954 --> 00:21:05,274
The young lady has a problem.

332
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:10,235
She asks: "Should I marry my
boyfriend or should I get a job?"

333
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,477
I... rarely meddle in affairs
of the heart, but

334
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:17,178
in this case I should act to show
the young lady that

335
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:19,079
when the time comes...

336
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,338
when the time comes that she's
really in love,

337
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:29,159
there will be no questions
to which course to follow.

338
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,800
But until that time...

339
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:41,483
I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but
that's all for the present.

340
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:48,044
Ring down the curtain.
Ring down the curtain, I tell you!

341
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:49,945
Ring it down!
Ring down the curtain!

342
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:25,493
Everything is all right, darling. Court
talked to the manager. He understands.

343
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:28,695
Why shouldn't he?
Could happen to anybody.

344
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:31,853
I just felt dizzy.
Couldn't think.

345
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:35,014
Obviously caught cold
being out on the rain all the afternoon.

346
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:36,115
Johnny...

347
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,616
Where is Court?

348
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:40,896
He's on his way up.
It was something you saw, wasn't it?

349
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,076
No, it wasn't that this time.

350
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,817
- Something you saw about me?
- Oh, don't be silly.

351
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,675
I don't mind if you don't wanna tell me,

352
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:50,237
just if it doesn't make any difference
about our loving each other.

353
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,878
For the heaven's sake, Jenny.
I told you it wasn't anything.

354
00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:55,858
My mind went blank.
I couldn't think, that was all.

355
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:59,860
- Well, how are you feeling?
- Fine.

356
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,700
That's good. I have an idea
to be completely cured.

357
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,902
A little relaxation at the
Pairie Room downstairs.

358
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,359
Dancing, a little supper...

359
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,941
That would be fun, wouldn't Johnny?

360
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:09,785
Yeah, I'm all for it.
You deserve a break.

361
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:12,386
You haven't danced in months.
Have a good time.

362
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:14,625
- But you're coming too?
- Yes, I'll  joint you in a minute.

363
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,901
Now you order
the best supper in the place

364
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:18,902
and be sure you get
the best table of the joint.

365
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,424
That's prosperous.

366
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:23,306
And slip the orchestra something
so they play good

367
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:24,603
when I charleston through the roof.

368
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:28,466
- I'll save the first dance for you.
- The first and the last.

369
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,387
Say, Johnny, I was talking to
that man again, what do you think?

370
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:33,225
Comanche Hills in Oklahoma.

371
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,689
It's one of the biggest oil fields
in the country, Court.

372
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,690
Brother!

373
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,330
We'll see downstairs, Johnny.
Come on, Jenny.

374
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,831
- Bye bye, darling.
- Bye bye.

375
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:59,954
<i>Somebody once wrote a poem,</i>

376
00:23:59,954 --> 00:24:04,831
<i>something about each man killing
the things he loves.</i>

377
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,434
<i>They might have been writing about me.</i>

378
00:24:09,195 --> 00:24:14,156
<i>What I've seen looking at
Jenny on the stage was her death,</i>

379
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:18,919
<i>a death through me,
if I had remained with her. </i>

380
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:23,438
<i>If I stayed, will be married,
it would be a child.</i>

381
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:26,998
<i>The child would live,
but Jenny wouldn't.</i>

382
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,401
<i>Maybe it was a wrong decision,
I don't even know now.</i>

383
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:37,482
<i>Jenny would be hurt, of course,
bewildered, but</i>

384
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:40,082
<i>Whitney Court would stand by.</i>

385
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,523
<i>I knew to save my sanity I had to go.</i>

386
00:24:45,523 --> 00:24:49,163
I took the first train out.
Happing to be westward.

387
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:53,026
And as I sat on the dusty chaircar,

388
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:57,144
I suddenly realized it wasn't just
Court and Jenny I had to leave.

389
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:59,486
It was everybody.

390
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:02,868
I became a sort of a reverse zombie.

391
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:08,527
I was living in a world already dead,
and I alone knowing it.

392
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:12,610
So when the train reached Arizona,
I got off.

393
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,531
I found a deserted gold mining camp.

394
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:16,430
Lived there for five years.

395
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:22,290
- What happened to Jenny?
- She died when I was born.

396
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:26,890
Yeah, I read about it in Variety,
a week after it happened.

397
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:31,055
I failed!

398
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:37,313
I wanted to write Court and
tell him how sorry I was, but

399
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:41,117
I realized that it would
only make more trouble.

400
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,736
I found a sort of peace
on the desert,

401
00:25:46,737 --> 00:25:48,537
but I was lonely.

402
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:53,056
And then, towards the end of the fifth
year, I picked up a California newspaper

403
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:55,698
and I read that Whitney Courtland,
the oil man,

404
00:25:55,698 --> 00:25:58,178
was establishing his
headquarters in Los Angeles.

405
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,178
<i>I estabished the headquarters there too,</i>

406
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:04,780
<i>but on a far less pretentious
neigborhood.</i>

407
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:09,862
<i>I was drawn by a strange sort
of compassion onto me,</i>

408
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:12,422
<i>being the only friend I had on earth.</i>

409
00:26:14,462 --> 00:26:18,386
<i>It was an odd part of the city,
but I liked it.</i>

410
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:21,785
<i>It was a strictly
"no-questions asked" area;</i>

411
00:26:21,785 --> 00:26:26,107
<i>people minding their own business
and letting you mind yours.</i>

412
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:29,864
<i>In after 15 years my social
conversation</i>

413
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:32,586
<i>didn't exceed 25 words a day.</i>

414
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:37,786
<i>Mi work, well it was solitary too.</i>

415
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:40,507
<i>Parlor magic, disappearing coins,
marked cards.</i>

416
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,668
<i>false bottom water glasses,</i>

417
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:45,431
<i>things I've learned
to make on my bodeful days, </i>

418
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,289
<i>all sold by mail.</i>

419
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,471
<i>It was a lonely life,</i>

420
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:54,791
<i>but it was pleasant to be
near Court and his daughter.</i>

421
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:57,389
<i>I read about them on the papers.</i>

422
00:26:57,389 --> 00:27:00,633
<i>In my room where I ate,
slept and worked,</i>

423
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:05,712
<i>I could go to the window and
see the skyscraper he built,</i>

424
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:08,314
<i>the Comanche Building.</i>

425
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:12,635
<i>Only once in all that time that
I risked fate by going nearhand of you.</i>

426
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:17,356
<i>It was three months ago.</i>

427
00:27:20,916 --> 00:27:24,116
<i>It was the night of your debut
at the Mayfield Hotel.</i>

428
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:25,840
<i>I read about it in the papers. </i>

429
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:30,041
<i>One thousand guests,
two orchestras in the grand ballroom.</i>

430
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,081
<i>orchids brought all the way
from South America.</i>

431
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:35,401
<i>I watched you leave the limousine</i>

432
00:27:35,502 --> 00:27:38,202
<i>and walk towards the doors
holding tight to Court's arm.</i>

433
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,700
<i>And, for a moment, it was almost
as though the 20 years never been.</i>

434
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,803
<i>as if there was Court and Jenny
going into the hotel.</i>

435
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:54,084
<i>Then, just as you disappeared,
something happened.</i>

436
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:59,205
<i>I had a flitting glimpse of a wreckage,
a wreckage of an airplane.</i>

437
00:28:00,086 --> 00:28:05,167
<i>It was a faint impression, blurred, hazy,
like a double exposed negative.</i>

438
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,827
<i>I forgot about it entirely,</i>

439
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:09,949
<i>forgot about until one night as
I was working lately,</i>

440
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,950
<i>picture jumped into focus.</i>

441
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:18,411
<i>Now the 11:55 news, brought to you
by your Comanche Oil Reporter.</i>

442
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:21,131
<i>New York. Flying his
converted Army bomber,</i>

443
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:23,971
<i>Whitney Courtland, multimillonaire
president of Comanche Oil,</i>

444
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,171
<i>took off from La Guardia field
early today</i>

445
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,851
<i>in an attempt to smash the
East-West transcontinental speed record.</i>

446
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:32,973
<i>He and his pilot, Captain Martinson,
former Army ace,</i>

447
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:35,095
<i>expect to reach Los Angeles
in time for breakfast,</i>

448
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:36,735
<i>if the favorable weather...</i>

449
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,976
<i>It was after midnight when
I reached your house.</i>

450
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:51,637
<i>I suppose I was an odd looking figure.</i>

451
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:53,438
<i>At least, the butler thought so.</i>

452
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:55,996
<i>I was afraid you wouldn't see me,
so when he left to find you,</i>

453
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:57,397
<i>I followed him.</i>

454
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,984
<i>Your friends were dancing,</i>

455
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:32,106
<i>I looked for you but,
not finding you there,</i>

456
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:35,607
<i> I went downstairs
to the lower terrace.</i>

457
00:29:44,628 --> 00:29:47,670
<i>It was a lazy, warm, summer night that</i>

458
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,808
<i>seemed as remote from tragedy
as anything on earth.</i>

459
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,071
I told him to wait outside.

460
00:29:55,071 --> 00:29:57,591
This is important. Miss Courtland,
I am an old friend of your father's.

461
00:29:57,691 --> 00:29:59,273
and I have an urgent message for him.

462
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:00,771
I'm sorry, he's not here.

463
00:30:00,872 --> 00:30:02,572
Yes, I know, but I've to
switch him at once.

464
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,113
I'm afraid that's impossible.
He's flying from New York.

465
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:07,855
- Non stop?
- One stop in Wichita for fuel.

466
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:11,034
Well, then, please call there. Leave a
message for him to halt the fly.

467
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:14,314
Halt the flight!
He'll laugh at me.

468
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:16,757
Not if you say the message
comes from John Triton.

469
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:21,637
John Triton? But dad told me
John Triton was dead.

470
00:30:21,637 --> 00:30:22,837
No, he's not dead.

471
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:25,358
- Who is John Triton?
- He was dad's best friend.

472
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,400
I'd avise you to call there.

473
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,838
Why should Mr. Courtland
stop his flight?

474
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:32,438
Because if he doesn't,
the plane will crash!

475
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,780
And... just how do you know that?

476
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,581
Does it matter?
Is it too late to reach him?

477
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,682
- No, I suppose not.
- Well, then, please call.

478
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,963
What do you think, Elliott?

479
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,243
I think it's quite a nonsense.
but, what would you lose

480
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:54,065
except three dollars on the phone bill?

481
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:55,566
All right.

482
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:09,487
Hello. I'd like the municipal airport
of Wichita, Kansas, please.

483
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:12,028
Do you make a practice of going
around predicting airplane crashes?

484
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:12,729
No, I don't.

485
00:31:12,928 --> 00:31:15,288
- Maybe just the planes of very rich men?
- No, not even those.

486
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:17,447
Then, what is it? A bet that
he won't break the record?

487
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:19,449
The night manager, please.

488
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,009
Hello, this is Whitney
Courtland's daughter.

489
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:24,971
I'd like a message delivered to
my father when he lands.

490
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:28,171
Oh, yes...

491
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:32,490
No, no that's all right.
Good bye.

492
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:37,694
- He's already taken off.
- Good! That means he's got the record.

493
00:31:37,794 --> 00:31:39,214
Or smashed the plane.

494
00:31:39,214 --> 00:31:42,974
Don't be silly. Our friend here
is just a harmless crank.

495
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:45,814
Oh, he's gone.

496
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,138
You see?
He got while the getting was good.

497
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:58,538
Elliott, I remember something
dad said about him,

498
00:31:58,538 --> 00:32:00,657
something about his having visions.

499
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:02,939
I get them too.
And I'll tell you what I see:

500
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:04,898
a shakedown that didn't come off.

501
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:06,700
You were impressed enough
to let me call.

502
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,739
Impressed?
Just wanted to see how far he'd go.

503
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:12,540
I think we'll have a good laugh
when your father come.

504
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,744
<i>That night I couldn't sleep.</i>

505
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,745
<i>Thoughts wheeled around my head
like pinwheels.</i>

506
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:41,268
<i>Again the strange feeling that I was
responsible for the things I saw</i>

507
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,469
<i> came to me.</i>

508
00:32:42,768 --> 00:32:45,489
<i>I wondered if I shouldn't remain quiet.</i>

509
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:49,988
<i>And then, I remembered the newsboy.</i>

510
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:54,311
<i>In the morning, it was announced over
the radio that the plane was missing.</i>

511
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:57,432
<i>There it was again, after 20 years.</i>

512
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:59,811
<i>I made up my mind to leave
before you found me</i>

513
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:02,512
<i>to bury myself completely this time.</i>

514
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:06,214
<i>I recall I was packing the same
battered suitcase</i>

515
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:08,715
<i>when you knocked on the door.</i>

516
00:33:13,912 --> 00:33:18,035
<i>And you, Miss Courtland, asked me if I
knew what had happened to your father.</i>

517
00:33:18,675 --> 00:33:22,117
<i>I couldn't tell you. All I've
seen was the wrecked plane.</i>

518
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,596
I've thinking a lot
about you, Mr. Triton.

519
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:27,557
Somebody telephoned or
wired you about the plane.

520
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,057
- I assure you they didn't.
- Then, what did happen?

521
00:33:30,857 --> 00:33:38,860
I... had a forewarning, an impression of
the crash about three months ago.

522
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:40,161
Three months ago!

523
00:33:40,282 --> 00:33:41,598
How much did you see?

524
00:33:41,598 --> 00:33:44,680
Nothing too clear, just an
impression of the crash, that's all.

525
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,722
Look, if you saw all this three months
ago, why did you wait...?

526
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:47,823
Quiet, please.

527
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:49,843
Where was the plane?

528
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:52,801
It seemed to be somewhere
on the mountains.

529
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:55,004
Your pal didn't send you very much
information, did he?

530
00:33:55,004 --> 00:33:57,205
No. There's no one else
connected with it.

531
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:03,325
What's the matter?

532
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:08,127
- You have a maid, a thin dark girl.
- Yes, Edna.

533
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:11,446
Well, get rid of her before your
brooch, your sapphire brooch...

534
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:24,131
Doesn't matter.
It won't make any difference.

535
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,169
Look, fellow, I think it's
about time somebody...

536
00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:30,772
<i>We interrupt this program to bring
you a special news bulletin.</i>

537
00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:33,094
<i>Wreckage of the Comanche Angel,
converted bomber</i>

538
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,534
<i>in which Whitney Courtland
and his pilot, Captain Martinson,</i>

539
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:37,852
<i>were attempting to smash
the East-West record,</i>

540
00:34:37,852 --> 00:34:41,454
<i>was discovered early today by
forest rangers in Gallup, New Mexico.</i>

541
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,377
<i>Both occupants of the plane are dead.</i>

542
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:48,678
Jean!

543
00:34:53,497 --> 00:34:56,197
<i>For almost a week I hardly left my room.</i>

544
00:34:56,297 --> 00:35:00,679
<i>I busied myself, I tried not to think
of the decision I had to make.</i>

545
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:04,458
<i>It had to be some way to prevent
the tragedy that I've seen.</i>

546
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:08,258
<i>My running away, my not speaking
haven't saved Jenny.</i>

547
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:12,942
<i>Now I wandered if I should try
the other course: challenge fate.</i>

548
00:35:12,942 --> 00:35:15,700
<i>And then, the next morning you
came back to see me.</i>

549
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:25,983
- May I speak to you for a moment?
- Yes, of course.

550
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:35,585
As a matter of fact, I was just
touring for your house.

551
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:37,747
Then, I suppose you heard.

552
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:40,267
What?

553
00:35:40,267 --> 00:35:42,987
About my sapphire brooch.

554
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:46,949
It's disappeared and
so has my maid, Edna,

555
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:49,230
just as you said they would.

556
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:54,148
I'm sorry, but I imagine
the brooch was insured.

557
00:35:54,148 --> 00:35:56,910
I haven't bothered to find out.

558
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:03,632
You see, I remembered you said
that it wouldn't make any difference.

559
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:11,550
You meant I was going to die.,
didn't you?

560
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,955
That's what I thought.

561
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:31,357
How soon is it going to be?

562
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,158
Quite soon.

563
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,678
Six months?

564
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,362
One month?

565
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,639
Sooner than that.

566
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:59,203
How soon... and where?

567
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:06,965
Within a few days...
before the end of the week...

568
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:12,566
at night... under the stars.

569
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,769
Perhaps it was a mistake...
my telling her.

570
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:27,370
Not if you were trying to help her.

571
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:31,252
Oh, I was... and  I am. I do want
to help. I want to help myself.

572
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,449
It isn't easy to live with something
like this,

573
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:37,254
something that has turned me into
a half-crazy recluse...

574
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,331
robbed me of twenty years.

575
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:44,293
I've tried to understand it. I've read books
on the occult, on divination, on sorcery,

576
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:47,494
on abnormal psychology...
but they ain't help.

577
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:49,576
That's why I told you the story.

578
00:37:49,576 --> 00:37:51,355
Because I thought that you,
with your training,

579
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,135
could help to explain
some of these things

580
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:56,257
and together perhaps we could do
something to avert what I'm seeing.

581
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:59,576
- Do what?
- I don't know.

582
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:04,318
If... if I could only have seen

583
00:38:04,419 --> 00:38:08,619
something beyond the big picture
of her lying under the stars,

584
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,079
if I could've seen the place,
identify it,

585
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,580
then we could keep her
of never going there.

586
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:25,543
In the meantime, Jean, you need some
rest. You'll be home in bed right now.

587
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,222
You'll help?

588
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:32,705
Frankly, I am still pretty confused, but
of course, I'll do everything I can.

589
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:37,305
- You are not coming with us?
- No, you don't need me.

590
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:41,787
You see it's day again.
The stars are gone.

591
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:12,195
Elliott, thank you for being
so nice on the way home.

592
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:13,174
About what?

593
00:39:13,174 --> 00:39:15,876
About not questioning me,
not being angry.

594
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:18,161
I could never be angry with you.

595
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:23,368
He certainly had many worries.

596
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:26,672
My plane landed, I tried the house
but you weren't here.

597
00:39:26,772 --> 00:39:28,473
I went to his place.

598
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:33,340
He seemed very excited.
He said you were in trouble.

599
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:36,443
He knew exactly where your car was.

600
00:39:36,943 --> 00:39:40,907
We got there, he sent me all alone, told
me to bring you back to the restaurant.

601
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,312
He's probably seen you from his
window, had you followed or something.

602
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:46,876
- But he didn't have time.
- I'm not too sure about that.

603
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,598
There certainly wasn't in dad's case.

604
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:52,142
He warned us some few minutes after
the plane took off from Wichita.

605
00:39:52,342 --> 00:39:54,847
Yeah, that's the angle
I couldn't figure.

606
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:57,751
But now you believe
You told me you did.

607
00:39:57,851 --> 00:40:02,012
I told I might help and that's all.
Are you ready to get some sleep?

608
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,979
Good night.

609
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:12,767
I mean good morning.
See you later.

610
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:27,949
Sort of early, aren't you, Preston?

611
00:40:28,169 --> 00:40:31,087
We were wondering about Miss Courtland.

612
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:50,532
Operator, give me the police
headquarters, please.

613
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,840
Nobody told us we have
to get a two-license.

614
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,260
We give a man what he asks:
25 dollars. The question is...

615
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,263
Mr. Weston has been
calling you all this time.

616
00:40:59,264 --> 00:41:00,664
I've not asked we got
to have two licenses.

617
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:03,588
...were concealed under the floor,
...six were uncovered

618
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:05,789
along with a faro table
and two birdcage games.

619
00:41:06,153 --> 00:41:09,596
Yes, Corporation papers.
Triton Novelty Company.

620
00:41:09,696 --> 00:41:11,219
I've given him the name twice, now.

621
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:12,463
Come in.

622
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:15,783
You're bad. We'll ask
for a blanket injunction

623
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:17,386
as long as the D. A. give us
the green light.

624
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:19,829
Oh, maybe in the middle
of the week. Good bye.

625
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,112
Courtland report, Mr. Weston.

626
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,154
- Oh, fine, where's Shawn?
- He's on his way up.

627
00:41:24,194 --> 00:41:24,876
Good.

628
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,261
"Mind reading, magic tricks by mail,

629
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,604
watching by clairvoyance,
thefts predicted,

630
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,062
airplane crashed foreseen,

631
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:34,785
girls frightened to the point of
suicide by autosuggestion..."

632
00:41:36,129 --> 00:41:39,856
Well, it comes to quite a bizarre
little bundle, Mr. Carson.

633
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:42,656
Yes, sir, I know it does, but...

634
00:41:42,856 --> 00:41:45,541
This morning, when the police
transferred your call,

635
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:49,706
it sounded like one of the 156 we
get from crackpots every day.

636
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,469
I wouldn't have bother about it.
I would've forgotten it,

637
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:56,114
except if Miss Courtland hasn't to be
an ideal target for a confidence game.

638
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,618
She's young, she's wealthy,
she's unprotected.

639
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,800
Come in.
Oh, here we are.

640
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,185
Mr. Carson, meet Lieutenant
Shawn of the City Homicide Bureau.

641
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:07,406
How do you do, Lieutenant?

642
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:10,352
It was Mr. Carson who called our
attention to the Courtland matter.

643
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:12,053
Have you read the statement, Lieutenant?

644
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:13,616
I couldn't make head or tail of it.

645
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:16,259
I see you are not a follower
of the occult.

646
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:21,664
Well, I don't mind. And I might as well
tell you right now, Mr. Carson,

647
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:24,048
we've been pretty skeptical
about this story of yours.

648
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:25,592
And about you.

649
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:28,692
I didn't expect you to believe anything.
I don't myself.

650
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:29,971
Oddly enough,

651
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:31,975
there's a substantial element of fact
in what you told us.

652
00:42:31,975 --> 00:42:33,297
A match?

653
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:35,460
See, there was a man, back in the 20's

654
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,781
who built himslef as Triton,
the Mental Wizard.

655
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:40,184
Whitney Courtland was a
member of his act.

656
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:43,908
and the Courtland fortune comes from
the Comanche Hills oild field.

657
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,551
On August 4th, 1928 the fifth race
at Green Meadows

658
00:42:47,551 --> 00:42:50,113
was won by a horse named Peer Gynt.

659
00:42:50,633 --> 00:42:53,438
Only he got gypped.
Track odds were 12 to 1.

660
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:56,500
- Then he was telling the truth.
- To a certain degree.

661
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,642
Horse race results ain't hard to find.

662
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:00,885
What the Lieutenant means
is that the basic facts

663
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:03,068
are probably straight, I agree.

664
00:43:03,308 --> 00:43:05,347
but facts are easily distorted
to serve a purpose.

665
00:43:05,747 --> 00:43:08,573
For instance, Miss Courtland being
in the railroad yards

666
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:10,135
and his knowing about this
is supposed to be

667
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:12,498
proof for the validity of his visions?

668
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,898
Well, you offered the solution
to that yourself.

669
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:16,659
Back porch.

670
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:19,222
It's possible to see the railyway yards
from the back porch

671
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,145
and with a good eye to
spot a parked convertible.

672
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:25,067
And this prediction about Edna, the
maid, vanishing with the sapphire brooch

673
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:28,551
was all very baffling until Shawn
here made a discovery.

674
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:32,395
She used to live on Bunker Hill,
a couple of blocks from Triton.

675
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:35,900
It's pretty easy to be
a prophet, Mr. Carson,

676
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:38,401
with a confederate to help him along.

677
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:41,544
It's still on item, Mr. Weston,

678
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:43,845
how could he have known
about the plane crash?

679
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:45,568
Tell him.

680
00:43:46,531 --> 00:43:48,932
We were talking to the police
of New Mexico.

681
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:53,876
The plane was wrecked in the mountains
but it had not hit a pick, it fell.

682
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:58,063
- On account it threw a propeller.
- That's not impossible.

683
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:00,983
No, no if somebody worked
in the shaft with a file.

684
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:04,346
Which according to the investigators,
it's exactly what happened.

685
00:44:05,388 --> 00:44:08,990
- Then, it's murder!
- It ain't table tennis.

686
00:44:17,638 --> 00:44:19,441
You know?
I'm different from most cops.

687
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:21,902
Most cops feet hurt, but with me
it's my back.

688
00:44:22,502 --> 00:44:25,026
- Good evening, Lieutenant.
- Hello, Gowan. Everything set?

689
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:26,908
Half a dozen men around the place
and a couple inside.

690
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:28,270
It would take a miracle get through.

691
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:31,555
Maybe it's gonna happen.
You and Bertelli come along.

692
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:33,614
Wouldn't be simpler to arrest Triton?

693
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:36,495
For what? Warning people
about airplane crashes?

694
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:40,822
Good evening, Mr. Carson.

695
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,724
What's this? The Magic Guy?

696
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:45,425
I just happen to be looking
out of the window, sir.

697
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:49,307
- No law against that, I guess.
- That's right, Lieutenant.

698
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,618
Wouldn't the evidence of the propeller
shaft be enough to hold him?

699
00:44:57,718 --> 00:45:00,923
Huh-uh, on account that he was in L. A.
Stick around here. I might need you.

700
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:03,402
- But he knew about it.
- Yes, kind of it certainly.

701
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:07,149
What's this? A convention?

702
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,250
Some of Mr. Courtland's
business associates.

703
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,950
Elliot!
Excuse me, please.

704
00:45:14,656 --> 00:45:17,838
- Jean, this is Lieutenant Shawn.
- Elliott told me about you on the phone.

705
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:20,260
Hope my men haven't upset
you, Miss Courtland.

706
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,623
No, they've been very polite
and conforting. Please come in.

707
00:45:24,023 --> 00:45:27,268
These gentlemen with my dad were in
the East completing an oil merger.

708
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:29,932
Lieutenant Shawn, Mr. Gilman,
President of Mid-Tide Oil.

709
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:30,833
How are you. Lieutenant?

710
00:45:30,672 --> 00:45:34,794
Mr. Myers, attorney for the estate,
and Peter Vinson, dad's secretary.

711
00:45:34,795 --> 00:45:35,995
How do you do, Lieutenant?

712
00:45:35,997 --> 00:45:38,239
Hello, Carson, how is the
celebrated geologist?

713
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,240
Fine.

714
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,319
This folks are living here?

715
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,403
Why, yes, they've going over
dad's papers.

716
00:45:42,403 --> 00:45:44,244
Some of the merger details were lost.

717
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:46,887
- The estate needs settling too.
- You know about this psychic business?

718
00:45:46,887 --> 00:45:50,449
Yes, Miss Courtland told us something
about it and we would like to help.

719
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:52,411
However, if you'd rather, we'll leave.

720
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:54,975
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Nonsensical business anyway.

721
00:45:55,275 --> 00:45:57,377
Maybe... maybe not.

722
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:01,384
Don't think you staying will make
much difference.

723
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:03,085
provided you are willing to cooperate.

724
00:46:03,384 --> 00:46:07,068
Oh, you can count on us, Lieutenant.
Jean knows the way I feel.

725
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:10,710
- What do you plan to do, Lieutenant?
- Hang around until the end of the week.

726
00:46:11,951 --> 00:46:14,556
- Two more days.
- Don't you worry, miss.

727
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:18,238
No, I won't. Not with all of you here,
and Mr. Triton too.

728
00:46:18,378 --> 00:46:21,761
- You got him in the house?
- Yes, Lieutenant, I am here.

729
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:25,206
How do you like that?

730
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:27,407
Your attitude is natural enough.

731
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:31,771
I suppose you've been breaking down
my story, finding possible explanations.

732
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:33,372
We ran on a couple.

733
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:36,134
Yes, but there are some things
that are beyond explanation;

734
00:46:36,134 --> 00:46:37,895
otherwise, I would be under arrest.

735
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,457
Not a bad idea.

736
00:46:39,457 --> 00:46:41,900
I asked him to come, Lieutenant,
to be with me.

737
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,466
- Yes, you see I think I may be of help.
- Not in my book, you can't.

738
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:51,390
I'm hoping, perhaps if I... I may see
things more detailed, it could happen.

739
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:55,434
Oh, no, Mr. Triton, we are adults.
You can't sell us on visions.

740
00:46:55,634 --> 00:46:57,034
Let him speak his piece.

741
00:46:57,034 --> 00:47:00,079
Mr. Carson and I have
already discussed it.

742
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,001
If I see things clearly, it may
be possible to take precautions

743
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,603
Would not be my job?

744
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:09,349
Yes, of course, that's why I was
pleased when Mr. Carson called you in.

745
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:11,089
But your powers are limited.

746
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,851
Yeah, I never had much luck
with tea leaves.

747
00:47:13,851 --> 00:47:16,335
Which brings us to a point I'm
very curious about.

748
00:47:16,335 --> 00:47:19,979
How do you account for these...
alleged visions, Mr. Triton?

749
00:47:21,102 --> 00:47:25,623
- I... I doubt that I can explain it.
- I wouldn't mind hear if you try.

750
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:33,392
Yeah, I... I thought we'd a great
deal on prevision

751
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:37,195
and somewhere I've come across an
illustration that very nearly covers it.

752
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,619
Suppose you are on a train.

753
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,220
You look out the window
and you see a white farmhouse.

754
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:47,565
In a minute discard them, you're
watching cattle in a field.

755
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,686
And just ahead it, although
you can't see it yet,

756
00:47:49,686 --> 00:47:51,608
there's a clump of maple trees.

757
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:53,691
Past, present and future.

758
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:57,656
But to the man on top of
the train, they're all one.

759
00:47:57,956 --> 00:48:01,418
At one glance he can see
farmhouse, cattle and trees.

760
00:48:02,419 --> 00:48:03,219
Well...

761
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,124
Occasionally, I am like that man
on top of the train,

762
00:48:07,324 --> 00:48:09,686
even though I may be sitting inside it.

763
00:48:13,552 --> 00:48:16,194
How do you get on on top
if you're sitting inside?

764
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:21,318
You've been there.
All of you. You had experiences.

765
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:25,483
Telegrams that you knew the contents
are before you open them.

766
00:48:25,483 --> 00:48:29,244
Places that seem familiar, but you
never have been in there before.

767
00:48:30,488 --> 00:48:33,490
And under the emotional
stress of tragedy,

768
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,814
you notice how everything becomes
distorted and unreal

769
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,178
as the mind tries to escape into time.

770
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:47,184
In dreams it escapes too.
Not always in the fantasy.

771
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:52,189
- Sometimes the dreams come true.
- Your visions always do.

772
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:55,552
Yes, they always had in the past.

773
00:48:56,191 --> 00:48:59,517
And out of my asking, I've
no control over them.

774
00:48:59,517 --> 00:49:02,998
They come whe they come.

775
00:49:03,479 --> 00:49:04,922
Where is his room?

776
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:08,727
In the tower, over the terrace.
He wanted to be away from everyone.

777
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,127
It's 10 o'clock, and according to your
theory, Miss Courtland is in danger

778
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:15,010
only at night, when the stars are out.

779
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,254
All right, I'll make a deal.

780
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,477
You can stay provided you
stick in you room until daylight.

781
00:49:20,777 --> 00:49:23,799
- Would you like me to go now?
- Yes, I would.

782
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:28,262
Mr. Triton, you don't have to...

783
00:49:28,262 --> 00:49:33,269
It's all right. I prefer it.
I feel uneasy with people

784
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:35,472
after 20 years.

785
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:55,770
Easy, pitching boys, he got a loft
up there. See that he don't leave.

786
00:50:00,494 --> 00:50:02,417
You sure you wanna go into the garden?

787
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:06,743
I always do when I am upset.
It's a sort of hideaway from trouble.

788
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,946
Besides this has to be,
there's nothing we can do about it.

789
00:50:10,946 --> 00:50:13,790
Jean, it's not inevitable,
it's not even likely.

790
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:17,470
- He saw it.
- He said he saw it.

791
00:50:19,554 --> 00:50:26,479
I hate this... this terrible resignation,
just as you were half-dead already.

792
00:50:27,522 --> 00:50:31,166
You're like an automaton playing a part.

793
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:35,009
- An automaton locked down for 48 hours.
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.

794
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,050
Elliot!

795
00:50:36,251 --> 00:50:38,130
- Just checking out, folks.
- That's right.

796
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:43,419
This is Miss Courtland. I guess it's
all right for her to be down here.

797
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,020
Excuse me.
Come on, Joe.

798
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:54,749
I wish I could tell what
the police has found out.

799
00:50:54,749 --> 00:50:58,952
- What can't you?
- I promised. They think that...

800
00:51:00,754 --> 00:51:03,516
- Well, they think you'd go to Triton.
- I would.

801
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:06,320
I can tell you this much
even you tell Triton.

802
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,723
There's a logical and very unpleasant
explanation for the whole business.

803
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:13,087
For the newsboy?
For my mother?

804
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:16,570
He has taken a group of half-truths
and wovened them into an overall lie.

805
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:19,855
You're forgetting one thing.
Dad's told me stories about him.

806
00:51:19,855 --> 00:51:23,375
I've been remembering.
I remember Comanche Hills

807
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:26,461
and how dad once said that the field
really belonged to Mr. Triton.

808
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:30,106
Are you sure you remember it? Or is it
something Triton remembered for you?

809
00:51:30,106 --> 00:51:31,385
At least, give me credit for that.

810
00:51:31,386 --> 00:51:32,486
Hey there!

811
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:36,111
Don't think I'm going along with
this fortune-telling yarn,

812
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:38,995
but I'd look pretty silly and so will
both of you if anything happened

813
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,674
with all the stars up there.

814
00:51:40,674 --> 00:51:43,557
Why don't you go to bed like him
as the rest of them have?

815
00:52:34,348 --> 00:52:36,269
The windows are all locked,
Miss Courtland.

816
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,070
Thank you.

817
00:52:37,229 --> 00:52:39,433
Would you like me to sleep
in your dressing room?

818
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:41,593
No, I don't think so.

819
00:52:42,394 --> 00:52:46,117
I'm not afraid.
At least I don't think I am.

820
00:52:46,117 --> 00:52:48,260
You go to bed and get
a good night sleep.

821
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:49,361
Yes, Miss Courtland.

822
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:10,023
- All right if I come in?
- Sure, as long as he don't come out.

823
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:16,588
Is what they think?
Is he kind of strange?

824
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:18,749
It's pretty close.

825
00:53:22,034 --> 00:53:23,274
Come in.

826
00:53:31,602 --> 00:53:34,766
- I was hoping you'd come Mr. Carson.
- Why?

827
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:38,434
A moment ago the veil lifted again.

828
00:53:38,835 --> 00:53:42,635
I saw many things,
about Jean, about myself,

829
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:45,897
strange and obscure things
that I don't understand.

830
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,021
Perhaps as a scientist
you can help to interpret...

831
00:53:48,021 --> 00:53:49,361
Scientists don't believe in visions

832
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:51,021
and I don't wanna hear about them.

833
00:53:51,221 --> 00:53:54,324
Wouldn't it be sensible even
doubting me to... keep an open mind?

834
00:53:55,187 --> 00:53:58,911
You'd never forgive yourself
if I was right and you haven't helped.

835
00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:03,194
What did you see?

836
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:06,077
It was different this time.

837
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:12,083
A series of cloudy flashes,
and then the central vision.

838
00:54:13,643 --> 00:54:16,885
I made notes to make sure
I remember the order.

839
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:21,071
I saw a flower crushed under a heel,

840
00:54:21,894 --> 00:54:24,257
a sudden hard wind
that shook the windows,

841
00:54:24,558 --> 00:54:26,658
a vase shattered down the floor.

842
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:31,502
And I heard a voice saying:
"There's no danger now".

843
00:54:32,423 --> 00:54:36,666
And then I saw her again lying
under the stars and... by her

844
00:54:38,427 --> 00:54:40,672
something I don't understand at all,

845
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:43,873
something that looked
like the feet of a lion.

846
00:54:44,876 --> 00:54:47,596
Oh, I know it sounds ridiculous
but I saw them clearly:

847
00:54:47,696 --> 00:54:52,304
big front paws with curved talons
almost touching her head.

848
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:55,766
- It doesn't make much sense.
- Yes, I know.

849
00:54:55,966 --> 00:54:58,990
Did you say you saw something
about yourself too?

850
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:00,691
Yes, I saw...

851
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,094
No... uh... it's not important.

852
00:55:14,664 --> 00:55:16,747
Did you see when the moment was?

853
00:55:18,268 --> 00:55:22,831
Tomorrow night,
as the clock strikes eleven.

854
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,938
- I've been talking with him.
- Yeah, I heard it.

855
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:35,925
He's convincing.
I went up there to break him down,

856
00:55:36,325 --> 00:55:38,589
and instead he rather shook me.

857
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:39,827
More visions?

858
00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:45,234
A whole series of them, only one setting
with time. Tomorrow night at eleven.

859
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:49,638
Well, fine. Now we can all go to bed.
What else did he have?

860
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:53,341
A chain of small events leading up
to the moment.

861
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:57,665
The first was a flower,
crushed under somebody's foot.

862
00:56:25,212 --> 00:56:28,417
Then, by Jean's head he saw
the feet of a lion.

863
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:30,258
The feet of a what?

864
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:42,489
- Jean, are you all right?
- Are you all right, Miss Courtland?

865
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:43,512
What happened?

866
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:46,673
I don't know. Something over my face.
I couldn't breathe.

867
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:48,075
You had a nightmare.

868
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:50,976
No, I don't think so.
I've never had one before.

869
00:56:51,016 --> 00:56:52,340
Poor child!
What happened to her?

870
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,901
Do you need any help?

871
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,403
- Jean...
- Get some water.

872
00:56:56,743 --> 00:56:59,088
What is it doing here?
It belongs on the daybed.

873
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:02,227
Someone or something's been here,
but nothing human could've been;

874
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,131
the windows were locked.
I locked them myself.

875
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:05,252
Maybe so.

876
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:10,219
But they didn't stay that way.
Not in that dressing room.

877
00:57:15,742 --> 00:57:18,645
- Where are you going?
- Downstairs. There's something wrong.

878
00:57:18,745 --> 00:57:20,468
Yeah, but we've got orders
to keep you up here.

879
00:57:20,568 --> 00:57:22,809
- Hold, it'll be a minute.
- One more step and I'll wing you.

880
00:57:23,409 --> 00:57:24,750
We are not kidding.

881
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:27,455
Don't forget I warned you.

882
00:57:32,097 --> 00:57:33,520
First time in 20 years.

883
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,125
Yeah, it's him.

884
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:45,053
I sensed you were in
some kind of trouble.

885
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,914
I said that in my eye
you are the trouble.

886
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:48,753
What was going on out there?
How did you get in here?

887
00:57:48,853 --> 00:57:49,755
I walked.

888
00:57:49,855 --> 00:57:52,218
So wanna you don't tell me you flew.
It'd be beyond a purpose...

889
00:57:52,418 --> 00:57:55,702
- What's shooting about? You all right?
- Take it easy. Who is the one shooting?

890
00:57:55,902 --> 00:57:57,424
- You tell him.
- Me.

891
00:57:57,524 --> 00:57:59,004
- At what?
- Kind of the ground.

892
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:00,306
At the ground?

893
00:58:00,406 --> 00:58:02,168
Well, first at him, but
my gun wouldn't fire.

894
00:58:02,468 --> 00:58:04,111
Then it did, only he was gone.

895
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:05,151
He jinxed it.

896
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:07,593
You see, Lieutenant this isn't my time.

897
00:58:07,694 --> 00:58:09,994
Well it isn't now.
That's why nothing can touch me.

898
00:58:10,093 --> 00:58:13,378
That's just dandy. I can hardly
wait to tell the D. A.

899
00:58:13,478 --> 00:58:16,061
we can't touch you because
it isn't your time.

900
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:19,405
You can trick a couple
of dumb detectives

901
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:22,288
and hand us a line about crushed
flowers, broken vases and lions feet.

902
00:58:22,588 --> 00:58:25,089
You can try on throw us off guard by
claiming there's no danger

903
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:27,335
until tomorrow night and you can
shinny down from your window

904
00:58:27,336 --> 00:58:29,236
and do your best to knock off
Miss Courtland.

905
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:34,612
But we can't touch him.
It isn't your time. Show him.

906
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,743
You are making a serious mistake.

907
00:58:36,943 --> 00:58:38,551
My fate is linked to Miss Courtland's.

908
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:41,044
Because of that, I'm the only one
who might save her.

909
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:44,738
Your fate is linked to a pair a
handcuffs. Now ride him downtown.

910
00:58:47,388 --> 00:58:52,050
It's just a waste of time. I'll be back
tomorrow night before eleven.

911
00:58:57,027 --> 00:58:58,153
Throw the book at him.

912
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:02,071
I've had agree with you if he wasn't
so normal otherwise.

913
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:04,787
I got a couple of psychologists
in the University

914
00:59:04,788 --> 00:59:06,388
coming in to see him this evening.

915
00:59:06,487 --> 00:59:09,801
About ten o'clock.
I'll keep in touch with you.

916
00:59:28,961 --> 00:59:30,244
One hour left to go.

917
00:59:30,544 --> 00:59:32,997
Oh, it's you Mr. Myers. I don't know
how I'm gonna live through this.

918
00:59:32,997 --> 00:59:34,703
I'm scared half to death already.

919
00:59:34,803 --> 00:59:36,932
And that window!
The police have been up to me all day.

920
00:59:37,332 --> 00:59:39,538
Do you think it could've been him
somehow from the outside?

921
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:41,707
There's a simple explanation.
You left the window open.

922
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,716
I could have, of course, but I can't
believe that I...

923
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:45,324
- Where is the Lieutenant?
- I don't know.

924
00:59:45,424 --> 00:59:47,676
- He told us to be here at ten.
- That's to keep us from doing any work.

925
00:59:47,776 --> 00:59:49,244
You don't think this is
important, Mr. Myers?

926
00:59:49,245 --> 00:59:50,545
I think it's all poppycock.

927
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:52,550
Especially with our Nostradamus in jail.

928
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,338
Intead of searching for a
packet of stock options

929
00:59:54,338 --> 00:59:56,365
that will be worthless in 36 hours,

930
00:59:56,365 --> 00:59:58,472
we fiddle-faddle with a lot
of ghost stories.

931
00:59:58,672 --> 01:00:00,821
You're sure you can't remember where
your father put the papers?

932
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:02,492
No, I've been trying to,
but with all this...

933
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:04,398
How you expect the poor child
remember anything?

934
01:00:04,398 --> 01:00:06,965
- What about your father's secretary?
- No, Peter doesn't know either.

935
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:09,215
- Doesn't know what?
- They're looking for some papers.

936
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:11,286
Options necessary for
the Mid-Tide merger.

937
01:00:11,386 --> 01:00:14,433
I suggest we forget
business for... 58 minutes

938
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:16,882
and concentrate on the
so-called prophecy.

939
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,097
Isn't it obvious he's missed the boat
with his chain of events?

940
01:00:20,197 --> 01:00:22,789
A flower crushed under a foot,
a sudden wind, a vase shattered,

941
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:25,099
a voice saying "There's no danger now".

942
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:26,863
And it's fresh out of lions too.

943
01:00:26,963 --> 01:00:29,392
We got rid of every piece of junk
in the house with a lion on it:

944
01:00:29,465 --> 01:00:32,967
bookends, lamps, andirons, even the
stone ones which are at the entrance.

945
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:34,273
Where have you been?

946
01:00:34,273 --> 01:00:37,563
Checking the defenses. I must say it's
a very good show; policemen everywhere.

947
01:00:37,563 --> 01:00:38,950
Not a prowler in sight.

948
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:42,344
And there ain't gonna be. At half
past ten we've all got places to be.

949
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:44,631
And we're gonna stay in until eleven.

950
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:47,522
And then, if nothing happens, I'll go
down to my hideaway in the garden.

951
01:00:47,522 --> 01:00:48,687
What for?

952
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,153
To show the stars they were wrong.

953
01:00:50,153 --> 01:00:51,771
You know, Lieutenant?
I've been thinking.

954
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:54,471
Since you're operating on the
assumption Mr. Triton could be right,

955
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,554
wouldn't it be a good idea
to remove the flowers,

956
01:00:56,554 --> 01:00:58,929
eliminate the possibility of one
being crushed underfoot?

957
01:00:59,029 --> 01:01:01,296
- Plain nonsense!
- Can't do no harm.

958
01:01:01,397 --> 01:01:02,197
Gowan...

959
01:01:03,505 --> 01:01:06,418
- I'll take them.
- I'll handle this, sister.

960
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:07,419
Ah, no.

961
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,120
Oh, my God!

962
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:10,952
Hold it!
Don't anybody move!

963
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:15,811
Not a one step down.
Take them out and dump that.

964
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:18,263
For a minute, I almost believed
you gave your real feeling of...

965
01:01:18,304 --> 01:01:19,692
- What's that?
- What?

966
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:21,698
Under your foot.

967
01:01:28,697 --> 01:01:29,597
Well...

968
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:33,221
High beguesser our Mr. Triton.

969
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:37,116
Eight solid hours reading
literature on the subject,

970
01:01:37,316 --> 01:01:42,315
dust covered volumes on soothsaying,
vaticination, augury, prophecy,

971
01:01:42,415 --> 01:01:44,544
and I'm more confused than
when I started.

972
01:01:44,644 --> 01:01:47,254
Walters ought to be able to help you.
Right up his alley.

973
01:01:47,354 --> 01:01:48,577
Not completely.

974
01:01:48,877 --> 01:01:51,248
We have made extrasensory
tests at the University.

975
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:53,801
the usual ones: selecting cards
from a concealed deck,

976
01:01:53,901 --> 01:01:54,893
And rolling dice...

977
01:01:54,894 --> 01:01:57,394
With some rather astonishing
variations among our control.

978
01:01:57,793 --> 01:01:59,862
But it would take weeks
to examine this man.

979
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:02,974
First, we'd have to make sure there was
absolutely no chance of trickery,

980
01:02:03,074 --> 01:02:09,118
then, well, the matematical computations
for each single test are staggering.

981
01:02:09,118 --> 01:02:10,745
And generally controversial.

982
01:02:11,045 --> 01:02:13,743
Well, at least, you can give me
an off-the-record opinion

983
01:02:13,844 --> 01:02:15,744
as to whether he's a faker or a madman.

984
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:17,292
We can talk to him.

985
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:19,721
- Is Triton here yet?
- Yes, sir.

986
01:02:19,821 --> 01:02:21,307
- Send him in.
- Yes, sir.

987
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:25,961
I can tell you this: you will find
him about as convincing a customer as...

988
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:31,625
Mr. Triton, these two gentlemen
are from the University.

989
01:02:31,926 --> 01:02:33,226
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

990
01:02:33,592 --> 01:02:37,286
Yes, I have read some of Profesor
Walters' books about on parapsychology.

991
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:40,163
I found your monograph on mental
telepathy and intuition

992
01:02:40,164 --> 01:02:41,664
particularly interesting, sir.

993
01:02:41,863 --> 01:02:43,172
Oh, I'm flattered.

994
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:45,617
Mr. Triton, I've asked these
gentlemen to...

995
01:02:45,717 --> 01:02:48,070
To determine whether I'm a faker
or a madman.

996
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:52,452
And you, sir, have been explaining the
tests of an extrasensorial nature

997
01:02:52,553 --> 01:02:55,253
are lengthy and difficult due to the
mathematical computations

998
01:02:55,352 --> 01:02:57,848
and the possibilities of trickery.

999
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:01,961
- Send Wilson in here.
- Yes, sir.

1000
01:03:03,308 --> 01:03:04,638
Wilson, how long have you been
standing out there?

1001
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:06,939
- Just stepped out of the elevator.
- That's all. Thank you.

1002
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:12,017
Neat piece of deduction. Of course, he
knew we were talking about testing him

1003
01:03:12,117 --> 01:03:14,813
and we'd probably bring up
the obvious objections,

1004
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:16,662
but an excellent parlor magic.

1005
01:03:17,162 --> 01:03:19,913
I give you my word, gentlemen,
this is not parlor magic.

1006
01:03:20,411 --> 01:03:24,348
Yes, I have endorsed myself in a bit
of theatrics but for a purpose:

1007
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,188
I desperately need your help to persuade
Mr. Weston to set me free.

1008
01:03:29,587 --> 01:03:32,180
As you know, Miss Courtland's life
hangs in the balance.

1009
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,828
If I'm allowed to go to the house
to be near,

1010
01:03:33,928 --> 01:03:37,279
there is a possibility that I might use
this power of mine to save her.

1011
01:03:38,242 --> 01:03:39,326
Very interesting.

1012
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:42,599
And if he goes to the house and
the girl lives, as she will,

1013
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,877
he can maintain that he was responsible
and ask for a substantial reward.

1014
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:50,165
No.
No, I'd ask for no rewards, sir.

1015
01:03:50,466 --> 01:03:53,366
In the first place,
I haven't long to live.

1016
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,654
Oh, I'm not dealing for some pity.
I don't care what happens.

1017
01:03:57,453 --> 01:04:02,053
This gift, which I never asked for
and I don't understand,

1018
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:04,063
has brought me only unhappiness!

1019
01:04:04,826 --> 01:04:09,111
Over a period of 20 years various times
I've forced tragic occurrences.

1020
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:12,605
And no matter what I did, I couldn't
prevent them coming true.

1021
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,420
I thought perhaps you could tell me
something about it.

1022
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:19,490
Why was this gift given to me?

1023
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:22,690
And why was this other power withheld?

1024
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:25,947
This power to turn evil into good.

1025
01:04:26,893 --> 01:04:29,745
You gotta let me go. This is
my only chance, my last one.

1026
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:34,512
There is a possibility that this time
I may disrupt this chain of events

1027
01:04:34,512 --> 01:04:36,602
that Mr. Weston has told you about.

1028
01:04:36,702 --> 01:04:39,597
Defy fate and
save Miss Courtland!

1029
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:41,286
He's put up a good show.

1030
01:04:41,386 --> 01:04:43,625
Could you realize we must have
more concrete evidence

1031
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:45,926
before recommendation for release?

1032
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:47,878
Well I hope I've given you enough.

1033
01:04:48,378 --> 01:04:53,322
A kind of hallucination, probably not
unknown to people in his line of work.

1034
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,211
El sÃ­ndrome de la bola de cristal.

1035
01:04:55,511 --> 01:05:00,180
It apparently passes on some tragic
occurrance, like Mr. Courtland's death,

1036
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:02,510
convinces himself that he foresaw it.

1037
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:05,021
From there, it's only a step
for him to believe that...

1038
01:05:05,021 --> 01:05:06,249
Mr. Weston!

1039
01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:09,307
You have on your desk some papers

1040
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:12,979
relating to a man convicted
of murder, Amos Block.

1041
01:05:15,026 --> 01:05:16,499
You have very good eyes.

1042
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,211
He's to be moved to
San Quentin tomorrow.

1043
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,847
He'll never make the trip.

1044
01:05:24,657 --> 01:05:28,898
I see him in his cell...
suicide.

1045
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,868
That's one you can check.

1046
01:05:34,969 --> 01:05:36,168
Quinn? Weston.

1047
01:05:36,534 --> 01:05:40,151
How's Block getting along?
Oh, you did? Fine.

1048
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:43,385
Oh, just checking up.
Good night.

1049
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:49,016
Well, your man is in a cell all right,
playing solitaire.

1050
01:05:52,999 --> 01:05:55,234
When I turned on the radio, someone
was talking about a lion

1051
01:05:55,235 --> 01:05:56,935
escaping from the zoo.

1052
01:05:57,334 --> 01:05:58,755
I heard it in the 9 o'clock broadcast,

1053
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:01,256
a warning about something,
but I'm not sure.

1054
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,957
Well, folks, here's the setup.

1055
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:05,557
Me and Mr. Carson are gonna stick
in here with Miss Courtland.

1056
01:06:05,656 --> 01:06:08,571
Gowan will stay on the terrace.
Bertelli, you're to patrol the house,

1057
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:09,921
and the rest of you will go
to your rooms.

1058
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:11,437
Lieutenant, I thought
we were going to be permitted

1059
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:13,638
to assist in guarding Miss Courtland.

1060
01:06:14,802 --> 01:06:16,090
Now, what?

1061
01:06:17,112 --> 01:06:18,982
- Picked two trying to sneak out, Lieut.
- Yeah?

1062
01:06:19,082 --> 01:06:20,854
- What's the big idea?
- We are leaving.

1063
01:06:20,954 --> 01:06:22,866
When a person is fated,
others go with him.

1064
01:06:22,966 --> 01:06:24,268
- That's ridiculous!
- Ridiculous?

1065
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:26,521
How about Mr. Courtland's pilot?
He got it.

1066
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:28,286
- Let them go, Lieutenant.
- All right.

1067
01:06:28,386 --> 01:06:30,504
Ride them downtown.
Turn them loose after eleven.

1068
01:06:30,704 --> 01:06:32,633
- No, wait a minute, you can't...
- You want to leave, didn't you?

1069
01:06:32,633 --> 01:06:34,685
- I'm sorry, Miss Courtland.
- Never mind, sister.

1070
01:06:34,686 --> 01:06:35,485
Come on, let's go.

1071
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:37,293
Now, suppose we all get moving.

1072
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,011
I would like to add
my protest to Gilman's.

1073
01:06:39,123 --> 01:06:41,139
Both of us, and Peter too, are
perfectly capable of assisting

1074
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:43,068
and we resent being
shot away like children.

1075
01:06:43,168 --> 01:06:44,937
Well, Mr. Myers, you got a point.

1076
01:06:45,038 --> 01:06:47,638
But, you see, this ain't exactly
like you think it is.

1077
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,489
It ain't just a wholesale ghost hunt.

1078
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:50,678
We've got reasons to believe

1079
01:06:50,678 --> 01:06:52,869
that somebody tampered with
Mr. Courtland's plane.

1080
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:54,738
- Then, it wasn't an accident?
- Huh-uh.

1081
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:57,661
And we think maybe that same somebody
tried to Miss Courtland last night,

1082
01:06:57,662 --> 01:06:58,862
it it was a try.

1083
01:06:58,901 --> 01:07:00,779
Would he be fool enough to come tonight?

1084
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:05,748
Oh, it might, at 11:00, hoping everybody
would think it was a supernatural deal.

1085
01:07:05,848 --> 01:07:07,257
Just, where does Triton fit in?

1086
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:10,602
He's the smoke screen in all this stuff
about lions and crushed flowers,

1087
01:07:10,702 --> 01:07:14,485
and broken vases. He's so much more
lucky. Window dressing to hide...

1088
01:07:14,586 --> 01:07:17,385
<i>- Hey, listen.
-...keep doors and windows locked.</i>

1089
01:07:17,686 --> 01:07:19,986
<i>Warning to residents of Westwood Village.</i>

1090
01:07:20,087 --> 01:07:21,586
<i>Stay inside your houses.</i>

1091
01:07:21,659 --> 01:07:24,059
<i>Keep doors and windows locked.</i>

1092
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:26,141
<i>The lion which escaped
from an overturned van </i>

1093
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:29,542
<i>at Wilshire and Sepulveda early
this evening is still at large.</i>

1094
01:07:29,898 --> 01:07:35,090
<i>I repeat for the third time: Warning
to residents of Westwood Village.</i>

1095
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,625
<i>- Stay inside your houses. Keep doors...
- Turn the radio off!</i>

1096
01:07:37,725 --> 01:07:39,821
That's what I thought I heard
at 9 o'clock, but I wasn't sure.

1097
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:42,539
Never mind. Get out of here. All of you,
except you and Miss Courtland.

1098
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:44,090
Go out to your rooms.

1099
01:07:44,382 --> 01:07:46,281
- Hey, Bertelli!
- Yes, Lieutenant.

1100
01:07:47,282 --> 01:07:50,042
Gotta have a dozen riot guns on the
squad cars and pass them around.

1101
01:07:50,043 --> 01:07:50,843
Right.

1102
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,062
Tell everybody to keep
their eyes peeled.

1103
01:07:56,896 --> 01:07:57,796
Jean...

1104
01:07:57,897 --> 01:07:59,689
- I'm all right.
- Sure you are.

1105
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,230
It's just one thing...

1106
01:08:02,965 --> 01:08:05,018
Is it true what he said about the plane?

1107
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:08,488
I'm afraid so. They found file marks
in the propeller shaft.

1108
01:08:08,514 --> 01:08:11,301
- I don't think Mr. Triton knew about it.
- I think he must have.

1109
01:08:11,727 --> 01:08:15,904
Elliott, I believe in him, I wish...
I wish he were here now.

1110
01:08:16,722 --> 01:08:17,998
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1111
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:20,448
Now we got the big game hunters
out on safari.

1112
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:22,049
I got everything as tight as a drum.

1113
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:26,582
If anything happens around here tonight
my name ain't Shawn.

1114
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:31,537
Let us check the time.
Twenty one minutes, if that's right.

1115
01:08:31,876 --> 01:08:33,202
Got a watch?

1116
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:36,348
I make it ten thirty six and a half.

1117
01:08:36,448 --> 01:08:39,981
My old turnip is usually pretty close.
Let's make sure.

1118
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:49,614
<i>At the sound, the time
will be ten-thirty-nine and a half.</i>

1119
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:51,614
Ten thirty nine and a half.

1120
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:54,643
Right.
Now, it's official.

1121
01:08:55,627 --> 01:08:57,652
Better turn out some of these lights.

1122
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,108
No use making targets
out of ourselves.

1123
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:06,638
Sure it's a clear night out..

1124
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:10,761
You can see a thousand...

1125
01:09:12,361 --> 01:09:13,861
What am I saying?

1126
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,534
- Send Wilson in here.
- Yes, sir.

1127
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:23,387
Have me as heavily guarded as you wish,
but I tell you time is running out.

1128
01:09:23,587 --> 01:09:26,919
I'm sorry, but you produced nothing
that would justify our letting you go.

1129
01:09:29,848 --> 01:09:35,484
This can't be. I saw myself
at the house, under the same stars.

1130
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:41,502
Hello. Quinn?
Yes. What? Wait a minute!

1131
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,403
No, no, no...

1132
01:09:45,875 --> 01:09:48,785
Amos Block just killed himself
in his cell.

1133
01:09:52,474 --> 01:09:55,700
- Have you ever shot a lion?
- How could I've ever shot a lion?

1134
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,030
- Could sneak out of the bushes.
- What bushes?

1135
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,534
I was just saying it could.

1136
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,389
Look, it broke loose the other
side of Westwood.

1137
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:04,790
That's more than 6 miles from here.
Why, it could never...

1138
01:10:05,552 --> 01:10:08,058
- Hey, what's that?
- Sounds like wind.

1139
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,096
What's that?

1140
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:15,707
- Gowan...
- Yes, sir?

1141
01:10:15,808 --> 01:10:18,208
- What's going on?
- The branch of a tree blew down.

1142
01:10:18,307 --> 01:10:21,680
The branch of a tree blew down. It ought
to be a law against things like that.

1143
01:10:22,179 --> 01:10:23,686
The sudden wind...

1144
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,915
Yeah, another one.

1145
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:35,959
10:57:30.
Two and a half minutes to go.

1146
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:41,317
Funny how it came up so fast, like
as if somebody pushed the button.

1147
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:46,031
Look, you've got education. What are the
odds on this and him being legitimate?

1148
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:48,116
Yesterday I had said a billion to one.

1149
01:10:48,216 --> 01:10:50,787
You know? My Irish grandmother
used to tell stories

1150
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:55,339
about banshees and leprechauns and
blind singers with second sight.

1151
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:01,534
I always used to think she was kidding,
but now I'm beginning to wonder.

1152
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:06,931
Well, there is no scientific proof
of such things, Lieutenant.

1153
01:11:07,494 --> 01:11:10,924
Some of the big universities are making
experiments in that direction,

1154
01:11:11,024 --> 01:11:14,572
which means that scientists
think there's a possibility of...

1155
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:20,275
- Whoever you are, stay out!
- Hey, Lieutenant, it's about the lion.

1156
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,075
What about?

1157
01:11:21,174 --> 01:11:22,402
I just got a flash over the radio.

1158
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,603
A couple of guys from
the Sheriff's office

1159
01:11:23,602 --> 01:11:25,284
cornered him out near
the Veterans Hospital.

1160
01:11:25,284 --> 01:11:26,574
- What happened?
- They croaked him.

1161
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,735
- Yeah? Let us tell the boys.
- Right away, sir.

1162
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,666
Brother, that's a load off my mind.

1163
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:33,369
First decent break we've had.

1164
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:36,157
Kinda make this chain
of events look cockeyed.

1165
01:11:39,447 --> 01:11:42,616
- Holy smoke!
- The broken vase.

1166
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,705
It's eleven o'clock.

1167
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,158
- Gowan...
- Yes, sir.

1168
01:12:19,259 --> 01:12:20,359
Well, that's over.

1169
01:12:20,759 --> 01:12:23,459
Tell the boys to relax.
Get them some coffee and sandwiches.

1170
01:12:23,497 --> 01:12:24,357
Coffee...

1171
01:12:26,728 --> 01:12:28,471
Hell, I feel good!

1172
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:36,274
Darling, it's all history now.

1173
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:42,455
Elliott, I'd like to be by myself.

1174
01:12:44,897 --> 01:12:46,526
For a moment.

1175
01:12:47,126 --> 01:12:48,890
I'm not afraid anymore.

1176
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:55,710
You know?

1177
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:58,346
This business almost got me.

1178
01:12:59,147 --> 01:13:01,147
He should call it shot.

1179
01:13:02,672 --> 01:13:07,002
Flower, wind, broken vase...
even the lion.

1180
01:13:07,066 --> 01:13:10,515
Except for the voice saying
"there's no danger now".

1181
01:13:19,814 --> 01:13:20,913
Lieutenant...

1182
01:13:22,426 --> 01:13:24,155
- How'd you get here?
- I brought him, Lieutenant.

1183
01:13:24,255 --> 01:13:25,840
- Where is Miss Courtland?
- Outside.

1184
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,847
You let her go outside?

1185
01:13:29,247 --> 01:13:31,453
What's the matter with him?
Didn't he say before eleven?

1186
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,722
No, it's not, it's two minutes up.

1187
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:59,436
Eleven o'clock.
Looks like your troubles were over.

1188
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:01,383
But the clock inside...

1189
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:04,132
Don't be frightened.
There's no danger now.

1190
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:07,719
- The voice saying...
- Saying what?

1191
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:11,815
There's no danger now.
It must...

1192
01:14:16,567 --> 01:14:18,031
Put that down!

1193
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:27,029
Jean!

1194
01:14:30,687 --> 01:14:33,637
- Darling, are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right.

1195
01:14:36,063 --> 01:14:37,568
- Mr. Triton!
- Jean...

1196
01:14:37,889 --> 01:14:40,494
- We took care of him, Miss Courtland.
- But it wasn't him, it...

1197
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:41,823
That's ridiculous,
she's out of her mind.

1198
01:14:41,824 --> 01:14:42,424
It was you!

1199
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,125
No querÃ­a que encontrÃ¡semos
las opciones.

1200
01:14:45,726 --> 01:14:46,726
What was it?

1201
01:14:46,726 --> 01:14:49,325
He didn't want the options found.
He didn't want the merger to go through.

1202
01:14:49,424 --> 01:14:50,208
I don't get it.

1203
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:51,875
The options were due to expire the
day after tomorrow,

1204
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,698
provided Miss Courtland
didn't find them first.

1205
01:14:53,799 --> 01:14:54,498
Go on.

1206
01:14:54,597 --> 01:14:55,863
He tried to make sure she didn't.

1207
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:57,353
In that case, he could keep
the options money

1208
01:14:57,353 --> 01:14:59,677
and still retain control of the vast
Mid-Tide Oild interests.

1209
01:14:59,877 --> 01:15:01,644
Yeah, could be.

1210
01:15:01,744 --> 01:15:04,869
And it could be you were the one who
tampered with Mr. Courtland's plane.

1211
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:09,281
Ride him downtown.
The two of them were in cahoots.

1212
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:13,094
I think you're wrong.
I think he gave his life to save her.

1213
01:15:13,194 --> 01:15:14,365
No, the whole thing was an act.

1214
01:15:14,366 --> 01:15:17,065
Otherwise, Miss Courtland would
be dead as he predicted.

1215
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:21,356
He thought she was.
The visions all came true.

1216
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:27,697
The time, the lion, the stars...
Only they ended with his death.

1217
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,991
He couldn't see past that.

1218
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,691
Couldn't know that she was still alive.

1219
01:15:33,489 --> 01:15:35,148
This letter fell out of his pocket.

1220
01:15:38,371 --> 01:15:39,439
It's for you.

1221
01:15:47,722 --> 01:15:54,048
"Dear Carson, as you read this,
I will be lying at your feet,

1222
01:15:54,048 --> 01:15:58,704
killed by the revolver
that failed to fire last night."

1223
01:16:01,385 --> 01:16:02,919
"No one is to blame."

1224
01:16:02,919 --> 01:16:04,332
"My death was as certain

1225
01:16:04,432 --> 01:16:07,313
as the other events I saw in my mirror."

1226
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:18,076
<i>Some of you, well just
seeing me die, will doubt me.</i>

1227
01:16:18,076 --> 01:16:22,124
<i>Will believe these events too
had been contrived by me</i>

1228
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:27,505
<i>or you'll call them a series
of weird coincidences.</i>

1229
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:32,465
<i>But I know that you, Carson,
and some of the others,</i>

1230
01:16:32,465 --> 01:16:35,003
<i>will not dismiss it so easily.</i>

1231
01:16:35,748 --> 01:16:39,858
<i>My own strange fate must make
you ponder for a moment,</i>

1232
01:16:39,999 --> 01:16:46,191
<i>must make you realize that there are
things on earth still hidden from us,</i>

1233
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:53,644
<i>secret things, dark and mysterious.</i>

1234
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:01,694
