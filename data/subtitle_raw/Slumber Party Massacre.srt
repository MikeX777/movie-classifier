00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,049
but right now you are being

191
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:10,733
the opposite of fun.

192
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,134
I just want you to be safe.

193
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,769
And I am.

194
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,571
And I know how to be safe.

195
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:16,690
And you're safe too,

196
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:17,807
you know that right?

197
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,626
You are.

198
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,877
So just go do fun things.

199
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,479
Go live your life.

200
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,747
I know.

201
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,217
- And when was the last time
- you left the house?

202
00:13:27,243 --> 00:13:28,685
I have everything

203
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,176
I need right here.

204
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,548
I love you.

205
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,218
But no crying.

206
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,855
Okay, I love you.

207
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,946
Stop. Don't make eye contact.

208
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,970
- It'll give her an excuse
- to give safety advice.

209
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,869
Oh shit.

210
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,873
Call me when you get there.

211
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,919
- And right before
- you go to bed.

212
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,554
And first...

213
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:05,612
I will.

214
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,414
I will.

215
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:09,792
Girls wait.

216
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,497
- What's the name of the town
- you're going to?

217
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:13,837
- Dana forgot to write it down
- for me.

218
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:14,297
- -Laurel.
- -Lester.

219
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,499
Laurel, right.

220
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,218
They start with the same letter.

221
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:19,959
I always confuse them.

222
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,363
<i>Seatbelts.</i>

Yes.

226
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,621
Is she alive?

227

No.

It's a lady.

A dead lady.

Yeah.

Um, Junko Tabei.

237
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,371
Yes.

238
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,946
How'd you do that?

239
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,578
- She doesn't yell out random
- nonsense for one thing.

240
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:00,961
All right. Dana,

241
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:02,345
pick another one.

242
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,764
Someone the rest of us

243
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:05,205
might actually know.

244
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,388
- Uh, Dee, can you make sure
- everything's okay back there?

245
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:10,788
I don't want any of our party

246
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:12,188
supplies falling out.

247
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,723
Oh, my god.

248
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,559
- Could you imagine if we got
- pulled over?

249
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,926
We're not getting pulled over.

250
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,429
We'll just invite the police

251
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,929
to the partay.

252
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,546
None of that is funny.

253
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,769
Hey, seatbelt!

254
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:27,844
Do you know how often

255
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:28,916
accidents happen

256
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,242
- when someone temporarily
- takes off their seatbelt?

257
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:31,475
Well, I can't check

258
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:32,732
with it on.

259
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,077
That is so not better.

260
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:47,957
Ahhhhh!!!!!

261
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:48,824
What?

262
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,848
<i>Ahhhhh!!!!!</i>

263
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:51,818
<i>Ahhhhh!!!!!</i>

264
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,398
What is happening?

265
00:15:54,422 --> 00:15:55,855
There's someone in the back!

266
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,473
- Oh, my god, your faces
- are hilarious.

267
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:03,040
That was totally worth

268
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:04,607
all the hours of leg cramps.

269
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,576
Alix! What the hell?!

270
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,079
You told me I couldn't come.

271
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:10,579
What was I supposed to do?

272
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,681
Not come?

273
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,200
This is our special trip

274
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:14,717
that you are not invited to.

275
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,452
I know. That's why I'm here.

276
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,756
- You have no idea
- what you've done.

277
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,813
Just get in the back seat.

278
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,018
We have to go back.

279
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:24,476
Drop her off.

280
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,829
- If you're driving?
- We'll lose the day.

281
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:26,663
Breanie's right.

282
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,516
You drive like a granny.

283
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,233
- We're getting to the house
- just before dark as it is.

284
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:31,234
Maybe it's a sign.

285
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:33,236
- Maybe we should forget it
- and go home.

286
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,587
- Hey. You've been on board
- since the beginning.

287
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:36,139
Don't chicken out now.

288
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,606
I still am.

289
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,876
- I don't want Maeve's kid
- sister ratting us out.

290
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:41,277
She wouldn't.

291
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,145
She's like us.

292
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,248
- I don't know,
- it's not that...

293
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:44,467
Look, you know if

294
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:45,686
we turn around now

295
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,284
- we're never going
- to come back.

296
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,452
This is the weekend.

297
00:16:48,476 --> 00:16:49,618
The only weekend.

298
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,138
Yes, Alix can be a pain

299
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:52,655
in the ass.

300
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,192
Um, I can still hear you!

301
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,461
But...

302
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,835
She deserves to be a part of

303
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:03,206
our epic girls weekend.

304
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,955
We all deserve it.

305
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:06,702
A weekend of...

306
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,537
Partying?

307
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,573
Self-discovery.

308
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,409
To dig deep into our souls and

309
00:17:12,433 --> 00:17:14,243
pull out all the fear and anger,

310
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,362
and put it towards

311
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,479
something real.

312
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:18,517
- So that our futures can be
- brighter than anything

313
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,349
We could ever imagine.

314
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,586
You guys are talking about

315
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,820
doing drugs, aren't you?

316
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,106
Alix won't be involved

317
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,390
in any of the drugs.

318
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,791
How about that?

319
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,531
- I think we should totally
- vote on it.

320
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:33,796
Yes!

321
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,166
- I don't even know what we're
- talking about anymore.

322
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,800
That's a yes.

323
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:38,735
Yes.

324
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,793
Yes!

325
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,473
Fine.

326
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,476
But no drugs for Alix.

327
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,768
Okay.

328
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,757
- I think you have a leak
- in your radiator.

329
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:03,225
No. I just had the car serviced.

330
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,727
I don't know what to tell you.

331
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,198
- You're going to have
- to replace the hose.

332
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:08,230
Okay. Go ahead and replace it.

333
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,783
Garage closed years ago.

334
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,334
This is a gas station.

335
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,269
It's not an auto body shop.

336
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,272
- So we drive to an auto
- body shop.

337
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:16,275
You're not going

338
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,276
to make it to one.

339
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,622
You've lost a lot

340
00:18:18,646 --> 00:18:19,966
of fluid.

341
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,544
My friend's got a shop.

342
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:22,326
He's got the part.

343
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,380
I could get it for ya.

344
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:26,366
Maybe by tomorrow?

345
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,616
No. We rented a house.

346
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,884
We have to be there tonight.

347
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,456
- You're not going
- to make it tonight.

348
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,522
What about... now?

349
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,926
- I don't see how that's going
- to help.

350
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,826
Whatever. I have to pee.

351
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:40,836
I'll go with.

352
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:40,931
I'll meet you back here.

353
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,550
Yep.

354
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,240
Aww.

355
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,966
Babies.

356
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,266
Look at this.

357
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,273
I've seen bigger.

358
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,093
Of course you have.

359
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,934
What is up with this?

360
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,000
People steal a lot of dogs

361
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:34,350
around here.

362
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,374
Nah.

363
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,921
They just get eaten by bears.

364
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,140
Wow, you came out

365
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:41,357
of nowhere.

366
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,292
Thanks.

367
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:43,844
Bears eat dogs?

368
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:45,394
That's so sad.

369
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,762
I know, honey.

370
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,198
The world's a sad place.

371
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,466
Our car is giving us issues

372
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,836
- and we need a place to stay
- for the night.

373
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:56,596
Uh, I like this one.

374
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,508
- Oh, you don't want
- to stay here?

375
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:00,509
Our lakes are a dump.

376
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,479
- We don't really have
- a choice.

377
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:05,093
Unless you know of someplace

378
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,706
else we can stay around here?

379
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,875
Not really.

380
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:12,506
You doing okay back there,

381
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,789
Peaches?

382
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,292
Yeah. All good thanks.

383
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:16,816
Just, just browsing.

384
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,874
Well, it's available.

385
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,144
What a surprise.

386
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,469
No offense.

387
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,740
<i>I'll check you in.</i>

388
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,528
- Do you want the penis man
- or no?

389
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:54,320
I mean, obviously.

390
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,630
Ugh.

391
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,237
Maeve! Are you okay?

392
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,106
No!

393
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,257
I think I just stepped

394
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:11,407
in human poo.

395
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,433
Ugh. It's so demoralizing.

396
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,313
It's not funny.

397
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,614
I probably have E.Coli.

398
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:19,915
I'm sure you'll live.

399
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:20,974
Come on.

400
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,492
Jolly Springs?

401
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,628
Why does that sound familiar?

402
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:08,121
Never heard of it.

403
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,305
Where did you get those?

404
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:17,606
I swear I would've left money,

405
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,243
- but I didn't want Kay to be
- complicit in selling to a minor,

406
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,545
So I stole em.

407
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,117
It works out for both of us

408
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:25,686
that way.

409
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,036
Stealing is still a crime,

410
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,408
Alix.

411
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,981
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

412
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,550
Is that the house?

413
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:19,803
Watch your steps.

414
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:21,704
Some of the planks are rotten.

415
00:24:21,728 --> 00:24:22,973
They catch all these

416
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:24,240
in the lake?

417
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:25,441
That's a shark.

418
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,133
I know.

419
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,279
<i>Ahhhhh!!!!!</i>

420
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:32,248
Alix, are you okay?

421
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:33,416
Yeah, I'm fine.

422
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,750
A raccoon was in the sink.

423
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,736
It ran out when I screamed.

424
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,071
Oh, this town isn't what

425
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:39,288
it used to be.

426
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,491
- We get untoward characters
- here sometimes.

427
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:43,560
Stay inside, stay...

428
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:45,628
stay quiet and stay safe.

429
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,763
I'm not getting any signal.

430
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,333
Out here you won't.

431
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:51,836
Wi-Fi password's on the fridge

432
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,336
and my number's here too.

433
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,755
Text me if you have

434
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:56,172
any problems.

435
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:57,191
Thanks Kay.

436
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,231
We appreciate it.

437
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,294
I feel bad for her.

438
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:18,427
Me too.

439
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,562
Old people are depressing.

440
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,130
Shh. She can hear you.

441
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:23,332
Please. She can't hear.

442
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,924
She's old.

443
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:32,108
Well, now that we're here,

444
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:33,444
guess it's time to start

445
00:25:33,468 --> 00:25:34,777
the slumber party!

446
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,307
Ew.

447
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,406
Oh, you guys.

448
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,724
- I can't believe
- we're doing this.

449
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:21,624
I love you guys so much.

450
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:23,527
- -I want in!
- -Me too!

451
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:24,894
I love you guys.

452
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,898
Woo. I love this song.

453
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:38,708
Ugh, I wish I never came!

454
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,743
Shit.

455
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,322
Hey.

456
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,424
It's you.

457
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:29,827
My friend dropped off the

458
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:31,227
supplies on his way home,

459
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:32,929
- so I thought
- I'd drop it by

460
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,599
- In case they wanted to leave
- tonight instead.

461
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,271
- But I can bring it
- to them tomorrow.

462
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:40,287
They seem pretty busy

463
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:41,327
right now.

464
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:46,343
I'm just gonna get

465
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:47,367
out of here.

466
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:52,872
I'll uh, catch you later.

467
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:13,170
<i>Chug it! Chug it!</i>

468
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:14,306
<i>Chug it!</i>

469
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,364
<i>Chug it! Chug it! Chug it!</i>

470
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,870
Fail.

471
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,872
Ugh. Boys.

472
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:10,193
Ugh.

473
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,445
How do you guys think

474
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:12,695
he's not cute?

475
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,447
He wears sports jerseys.

476
00:29:14,471 --> 00:29:16,196
Like, for formal wear?

477
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,705
- You have sauce
- on your chin.

478
00:29:21,731 --> 00:29:23,129
Oh, where?

479
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,306
Thanks.

480
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,756
Hey.

481
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Want pizza, nerd?

482
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,216
Alix?

483
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,654
Where'd Alix go?

484
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:19,261
Hello?

485
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,974
Are you okay?

486
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:26,186
Ahhhhh!!!!!

487
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:34,171
Ahhhhh!!!!!

488
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,208
- Alix, I told you not
- to go out!

489
00:31:38,234 --> 00:31:39,966
I was freaking...

490
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,510
Get inside, get inside!

491
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,614
Alix? You're bleeding.

492
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,517
- It's not my blood.
- Check all the windows.

493
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,385
What is going on?

494
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:49,820
- -Now!
- -Okay.

495
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:10,395
The guy from

496
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:11,616
the gas station?

497
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:11,775
He's dead.

498
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,875
What do you mean?

499
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:14,678
- I mean like someone
- murdered him.

500
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:15,578
Oh, that's so sad.

501
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,546
Are you joking?

502
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,065
Why would I joke about

503
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:19,582
something like that?

504
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,068
I saw him in his car,

505
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:22,551
he's dead, this is his blood.

506
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:23,737
Maybe he was murdered

507
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:24,920
by a bear.

508
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,224
- Kay did say there were creepy
- people around here.

509
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,511
I think it's bigger

510
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:29,796
than that.

511
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,160
You think?

512
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:32,529
- I knew certain things seemed
- familiar about this place

513
00:32:32,555 --> 00:32:34,397
And I couldn't put it together,

514
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:36,300
until I remembered this one

515
00:32:36,324 --> 00:32:38,200
Crime Bandits podcast episode.

516
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,536
I know it's hard to hear,

517
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,890
but I think, I think

518
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:45,241
the Driller Killer is here.

519
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:46,776
But he's dead.

520
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,096
I should've known when Ashley

521
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,414
mentioned the dead dogs.

522
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:52,933
A bunch of kids in the '90s

523
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:54,450
were murdered by this dude

524
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:56,270
Russ Thorne, and their car broke

525
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:58,087
down as they got here.

526
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,556
Just like ours did.

527
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,743
And they were having a slumber

528
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,927
party in pajamas.

529
00:33:04,951 --> 00:33:06,930
Eating pizza and drinking

530
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:08,931
stupid drinks.

531
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:11,435
- He murdered someone
- from outside watching them,

532
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:13,537
- And then when one of them
- went to go get the brownies

533
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:14,371
From the kitchen,

534
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:16,139
- he just snuck in
- and started killing.

535
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:20,310
- Oh my god,
- you assholes!

536

Sorry Alix.

543
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,627
We didn't tell you

544
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:39,826
because we didn't know

545
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,866

Look, don't worry.

549
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,770
When he comes for us,

550
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,104
we are going to kill him.

551
00:33:48,128 --> 00:33:50,473

if you think about it.

554
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,512
Did everything almost

555
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:56,579
exactly the same.

556
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:57,447
The PJs...

557
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,082
- The leak in
- the radiator hose.

558
00:33:59,108 --> 00:34:00,483
The drinking.

559
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:06,088
It's water.

560
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:08,008
Yep. The only thing different

561
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:09,925
is the house.

562
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:11,827
Oh no, don't look at me.

563
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:13,462
It wasn't on the board.

564
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:14,898
Maybe they don't rent out

565
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:16,332
the murder house anymore.

566
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:17,333
So what?

567
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,567
- We just wait here
- until he comes barging in?

568
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:21,337
Yeah. And then we kill him.

569
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:22,623
We've been planning this

570
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:23,906
for a year.

571
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,642
No matter what he does,

572
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,376
we are ready.

573
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:30,747
So, are you ready when

574
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:32,548
he comes knocking?

575
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:34,550
Maybe we should open it.

576
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,586
- You can't open the door
- for a murderer.

577
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:38,588
- A murderer isn't going
- to knock.

578
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:40,189
Yeah, Breanie is right.

579
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:41,625
- We know everything
- about him.

580
00:34:41,651 --> 00:34:43,750
He's not a knocker.

581
00:34:57,997 --> 00:34:59,241
Woah.

582
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,961
Hey, uh, I mean hi.

583
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:02,678
I'm, I'm John.

584
00:35:02,702 --> 00:35:03,846
Didn't mean to disturb you,

585
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,199
I just, I saw one of you on

586
00:35:05,223 --> 00:35:06,549
the dock a little earlier.

587
00:35:06,573 --> 00:35:08,651
That was me. Hey.

588
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:10,586
Alix forgot to mention that.

589
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,922
I had other things

590
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:13,255
on my mind.

591
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,523
Hi.

592
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,228
- Okay. Well like I said, I didn't
- want to disturb you.

593
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:17,696
- It just seems like we're
- the only ones here

594
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,231
- For the big Jolly Springs
- re-opening

595
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:20,714
So we thought we'd be good

596
00:35:20,738 --> 00:35:22,198
neighbors and come say hey.

597
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:23,556
This is Matt.

598
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:30,563
I have a girlfriend.

599
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,245
- You guys really shouldn't be
- out there.

600
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:36,379
Yeah? Why?

601
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:39,249
- Because it's dark and you don't
- want to get lost.

602
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:40,950
Yeah. Please, come in.

603
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,686
- Seriously, come in,
- come in.

604
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:43,954
- -No, we...
- -Bro.

605
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,189
Come in. Come on, yeah.

606
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:46,446
Awesome.

607
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,667
Oh.

608
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:59,453
Sorry. Didn't realize you guys

609
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:02,238
were getting ready for bed.

610
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:04,640
We don't mind.

611
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,712
- Are you guys staying in
- the house across the lake?

612
00:36:08,738 --> 00:36:10,336
Yeah.

613
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:10,714
Five of us.

614
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:11,814
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:13,600
We like this podcast

616
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:15,384
called Crime Bandits.

617
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:16,622
- John's kind of obsessed
- with it.

618
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:18,288
- Okay, I'm not obsessed
- with it.

619
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:20,490
- Well... we do this weird murder
- tour thing.

620
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:22,127
- People were murdered in
- the house we're staying in.

621
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:23,927
- It's way more boring
- than you think.

622
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:25,717
Which is why we thought

623
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:27,506
we'd come and say hey.

624
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,356
So... hey.

625
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,569
So uh, why am I asking?

626
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:34,955
What are you guys

627
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:36,339
doing here?

628
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:37,975
Our car broke down, so

629
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:39,608
we're staying the night.

630
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,912
- I mean, you guys can come
- and hang out with us...

631
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:42,946
No!

632
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,696
Um, we can't.

633
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,350
It's a girls' weekend.

634
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:48,285
No boys.

635
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:50,453
So... Thank you for coming by.

636
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,855
Okay, yeah sure. Yeah.

637
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,658
Oh no, wait.

638
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:58,595
- Can I just talk to you guys
- for a sec?

639
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:05,069
We have to tell them

640
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,260
what's going on.

641
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:12,109
- We can't tell them we're here
- to murder someone.

642
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:13,244
We can't let them

643
00:37:13,268 --> 00:37:14,401
be murdered either.

644
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:19,583
He doesn't want them.

645
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:20,816
He wants us.

646
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,685
I don't know, Dana.

647
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,286
- He seems pretty
- equal opportunity

648
00:37:23,312 --> 00:37:25,445
When it comes to murder.

649
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:27,447
Let's go bro.

650
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:28,491
What? No.

651
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:30,626
Anyway, we gotta go.

652
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,362
I don't think you should leave.

653
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,131
I agree.

654
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:35,899
- No, no. We really
- have to go.

655
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:37,501
- Wait, seriously guys.
- You shouldn't.

656
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:38,699
The other guys will know

657
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,896
if we're gone too long,

658
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,586
so, so take care.

659
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,610
What are you?

660
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:51,615
- You might've just sent them
- to their death.

661
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:53,583
- We cannot veer
- from the plan.

662
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,218
- That is the only way
- it will work.

663
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,453
The plan was for no one

664
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:57,711
to get murdered.

665
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:02,191
Fine.

666
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:03,592
We'll go after them.

667
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:08,032
Should I go get

668
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,556
the brownies first?

669
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:12,668
Hey, what was that about?

670
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:14,705
- I think they're those man-haters
- you always hear about.

671
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:15,539
What?

672
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:17,140
- They had knives hidden
- in pillows.

673
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,209
- -Matt, that is ridiculous.
- -Come on.

674
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:21,714
- What do you mean they had
- knives in pillows?

675
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:23,415
- Knives, in their pillows,
- like kitchen knives.

676
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,583
- Okay, what is this
- really about?

677
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:25,899
It's about knives

678
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:27,216
in their pillows.

679
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,120
- -I don't want to die.
- -Look, you're not going to die.

680
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,434
<i>Guy: Look man.</i>

681

00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,944

686
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:56,311
That's a really dumb thing

687
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,676
to say, Guy.

688
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,448
Well, I'm sorry, Guy Two.

689
00:38:58,472 --> 00:38:59,800
But I refuse to be insulted

690
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:01,150
by a bro wearing makeup.

691
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:02,218
Ohhhhh...

692
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:03,854
It's tinted moisturizer.

693
00:39:03,878 --> 00:39:05,124
- A lot of men wear it
- these days.

694
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:06,620
I don't think they do, dude.

695
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,140
I don't think they do.

696
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,894
Come on!

697
00:39:11,918 --> 00:39:13,298
- Hey. Where'd you get that,
- Shaun?

698
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:15,098
- I found it in the closet.
- Sick, right?

699
00:39:15,124 --> 00:39:16,556
Oh yeah.

700
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:19,566
Oh!

701
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,906
Chug it.

702
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,257
- There you go.
- Come on.

703
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,596
Hey.

704
00:39:28,668 --> 00:39:29,869
I gotta piss.

705
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,249
Dude.

706
00:39:32,273 --> 00:39:33,482
Bathroom's inside.

707
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:34,635
The world's a toilet,

708
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:35,809
my man.

709
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:44,126
How'd it go?

710
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,394
Don't ask.

711
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:48,664
You two are all charm.

712
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,250
Yeah, Guy Two, you remembered

713
00:39:50,274 --> 00:39:51,834
to turn the stove off, right?

714
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:53,402
I forgot.

715
00:39:53,426 --> 00:39:55,104
I forgot. I'm sorry, dude.

716
00:39:55,128 --> 00:39:56,172
I asked you to do one thing!

717
00:39:56,196 --> 00:39:57,306
Wait, he actually made dinner?

718
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,241
Yeah.

719
00:39:58,265 --> 00:39:59,275
I thought he was joking.

720
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:00,462
Yeah, well we have

721
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:01,646
to eat something.

722
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:01,845
Yeah.

723
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:03,837
That's why I brought chips.

724
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,462
Oh!

725
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,498
Ahh!

726
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:37,437
What the hell, dudes?

727
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:55,364
Hey asshole!

728
00:40:55,388 --> 00:40:57,223
You want a piece of this?

729
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:00,193

Guys.

1171
01:06:43,503 --> 01:06:44,514
- Who moved everything
- in the kitchen?

1172
01:06:44,538 --> 01:06:45,349
Our weapons are gone.

1173
01:06:45,373 --> 01:06:46,717
- They messed up
- the crime scene.

1174
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:47,684
Alix?

1175
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:49,453
- I didn't. You asked me
- not to.

1176
01:06:49,479 --> 01:06:50,821
- That never stopped
- you before.

1177
01:06:50,847 --> 01:06:52,556
- I don't know,
- maybe it was Ashley.

1178
01:06:52,582 --> 01:06:53,923
She wouldn't.

1179
01:06:53,947 --> 01:06:54,725
Guys, something's wrong.

1180
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:55,858
I think we need to leave now.

1181
01:06:55,882 --> 01:06:57,494
- Well Ashley should be done
- with the car any minute.

1182
01:06:57,518 --> 01:06:58,228
Oh.

1183
01:06:58,252 --> 01:06:59,696
- And who's watching
- the body?

1184
01:06:59,722 --> 01:07:00,863
I asked Alix to do it.

1185
01:07:00,887 --> 01:07:02,366
- He's dead.
- I got bored.

1186
01:07:02,392 --> 01:07:03,423
Shit.

1187
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:06,896
Dana, he's dead.

1188
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,204
Oh, and his body is gone?

1189
01:07:08,228 --> 01:07:09,746
No, no, no, no, no!

1190
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,310
He was just there.

1191
01:07:14,734 --> 01:07:16,667
Ahhhhh!!!!!

1192
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:17,691
Maeve!

1193
01:07:18,339 --> 01:07:19,572
Ahhhhh!!!!!

1194
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,800
Ahhhhh!!!!!

1195
01:07:31,618 --> 01:07:33,163
- Someone is still
- after us.

1196
01:07:33,189 --> 01:07:34,430
You think?

1197
01:07:35,922 --> 01:07:37,390
Where's Ashley?

1198
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,917
Nooooo!!!!

1199
01:07:42,762 --> 01:07:44,616
He got Ashley!

1200
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,120
- Breanie, get away
- from the window.

1201
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:00,790
Shit, that was so...

1202
01:08:06,553 --> 01:08:07,587
No!

1203
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:20,609
I'm so sorry.

1204
01:08:20,633 --> 01:08:23,579
It's okay. It's okay.

1205
01:08:23,603 --> 01:08:25,356
Breanie?

1206
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:38,661
Maeve?

1207
01:08:38,685 --> 01:08:40,763
We have to fight back.

1208
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:42,765
He took our weapons.

1209
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:44,318
We don't have anything

1210
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:45,892
to fight with.

1211
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:05,488
How the hell is he still alive?

1212
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:07,380
What are we going to do?

1213
01:09:08,615 --> 01:09:09,870
I don't know.

1214
01:09:09,894 --> 01:09:11,146
You don't know?

1215
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:12,662
You planned everything.

1216
01:09:12,686 --> 01:09:14,176
You're supposed to know.

1217
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,360
How could I have known about-

1218
01:09:17,857 --> 01:09:18,669
- You should've called
- the police

1219
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:19,887
When Alix found

1220
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:21,103
the first dead guy.

1221
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:22,406
Now Breanie and Ashley

1222
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,706
are dead.

1223
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:24,840
This is all your fault.

1224
01:09:24,864 --> 01:09:26,509
We all did this.

1225
01:09:26,533 --> 01:09:28,177
We all wanted this.

1226
01:09:28,201 --> 01:09:29,378
Alix did it.

1227
01:09:34,474 --> 01:09:36,453
- Yeah, it could it be one
- of the guys.

1228
01:09:36,477 --> 01:09:37,387
- They're obsessed
- with Russ.

1229
01:09:37,413 --> 01:09:39,089
Maybe, maybe they're doing

1230
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,790
a copycat thing.

1231
01:09:40,814 --> 01:09:41,558
Maybe.

1232
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:42,792
<i>Maybe?</i>

1233
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:44,476
The best you can do is maybe?

1234
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,580
- We need to get out of here
- before they murder us!

1235
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:50,566
Okay, okay, uh...

1236
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:51,535
Alix.

1237
01:09:51,559 --> 01:09:53,704
- You said you found the dead guy
- in a truck.

1238
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:56,596
The tires were flat.

1239
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,441
Okay. The guys...

1240
01:09:58,465 --> 01:10:00,160
If their car is still here

1241
01:10:00,184 --> 01:10:01,877
we can run and take it.

1242
01:10:01,901 --> 01:10:03,661
- They could be the ones trying
- to kill us.

1243
01:10:04,771 --> 01:10:06,200
And how do we get out of here

1244
01:10:06,224 --> 01:10:07,674
without getting hit?

1245
01:10:10,643 --> 01:10:12,421
I'll go out the side window.

1246
01:10:12,445 --> 01:10:13,657
If you distract him

1247
01:10:13,681 --> 01:10:14,890
I can slip out.

1248
01:10:14,914 --> 01:10:16,592
Fine.

1249
01:10:16,616 --> 01:10:18,427
You go.

1250
01:10:18,451 --> 01:10:20,836
Alix and I will stay.

1251
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:21,598
No.

1252
01:10:21,622 --> 01:10:23,238
It's okay, I'm going

1253
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:24,876
to protect you.

1254
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,435
Like that?

1255
01:10:26,459 --> 01:10:28,128
Then you'll protect me.

1256
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:46,522
Hey asshole!

1257
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:47,891

01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:49,282

1264
01:10:58,725 --> 01:11:00,170
Come get me!

1265
01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:01,637

Go! Go!

1269
01:11:32,759 --> 01:11:33,793
Maeve?

1270
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:37,330
I'm not feeling so...

1271
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,521
Okay.

1272
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:12,599
Shit.

1273
01:12:16,436 --> 01:12:17,704
Okay.

1274
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:35,198
- Both: Why are you trying
- to kill us?

1275
01:12:35,222 --> 01:12:36,099
Both: What?

1276
01:12:36,123 --> 01:12:37,566
Both: You!

1277
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:38,668
You killed Matt!

1278
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:39,720
And I found Guy

1279
01:12:39,744 --> 01:12:40,770
dead in the cooler!

1280
01:12:40,794 --> 01:12:41,871
Guy died in the house.

1281
01:12:41,895 --> 01:12:43,374
No, that was the other Guy.

1282
01:12:43,398 --> 01:12:44,874
There were two of them!

1283
01:12:44,898 --> 01:12:45,976
Okay, well you killed

1284
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,076
Ashley and Bree!

1285
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,077
I didn't kill anybody!

1286
01:12:48,101 --> 01:12:49,803
Okay, well neither did we.

1287
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:53,884
Okay, well we did kill the guy

1288
01:12:53,908 --> 01:12:56,085
killing people,

1289
01:12:56,109 --> 01:12:58,254
but people are still dying.

1290
01:12:58,278 --> 01:13:00,657
- Yeah. 'Cause it's part of your
- big feminist plot

1291
01:13:00,683 --> 01:13:02,882
To get rid of all the men!

1292
01:13:06,152 --> 01:13:07,364
That was a really sexist

1293
01:13:07,388 --> 01:13:08,621
thing to say.

1294
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:12,401
Yeah.

1295
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:13,660
I'm sorry.

1296
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:16,674
But that doesn't

1297
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:17,931
change anything.

1298

1300

01:14:50,391 --> 01:14:51,600
did you eat?

1311
01:14:51,624 --> 01:14:53,336
Most of them.

1312
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,572
- Why? Do you think that's
- why I'm sick?

1313
01:14:55,598 --> 01:14:57,840
Maybe.

1314
01:14:57,864 --> 01:15:01,316
Please don't be mad at me.

1315
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:02,812
I'm not mad.

1316
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:04,832
I wish I listened to you.

1317
01:15:04,856 --> 01:15:06,873
I'm sorry I didn't.

1318
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:11,554
I don't want to die.

1319
01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:13,641
I'm sorry I didn't turn around

1320
01:15:13,665 --> 01:15:15,725
to take you home.

1321
01:15:15,749 --> 01:15:17,494
- But you are not going
- to die.

1322
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,131
- Dana's going to be back
- any minute now

1323
01:15:19,155 --> 01:15:21,197
And we're going to leave.

1324
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:22,549
How do you know

1325
01:15:22,573 --> 01:15:23,923
she'll come back?

1326
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,806
We take care

1327
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,373
of each other.

1328
01:15:30,397 --> 01:15:32,565
That's what we do.

1329
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:36,536
I love you, Maeve.

1330
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,273
I love you too.

1331
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,500
Kay?

1332
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:26,496
Hey kid.

1333
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:27,431
What are you doing out here?

1334
01:16:27,455 --> 01:16:29,298
I'm snail hunting.

1335
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:30,701
- Did you see someone
- out here?

1336
01:16:30,727 --> 01:16:32,896
Just you.

1337
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,306
- Okay, well there's a,
- there's a killer out here.

1338
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,806
- And there was one,
- but now there,

1339
01:16:35,832 --> 01:16:36,906
Now there's another.

1340
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,616
Are you okay?

1341
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,775
There's no killer anymore.

1342
01:16:39,799 --> 01:16:41,646
There was one once.

1343
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,415
- A lot of people heard about it
- because of this podcast,

1344
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:45,247
But he died a long time ago.

1345
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:46,683
- No, no, no.
- He didn't.

1346
01:16:46,707 --> 01:16:47,617
He didn't.

1347
01:16:47,641 --> 01:16:49,219
- He came back and he,
- he tried to kill us.

1348
01:16:49,243 --> 01:16:50,252
But then we killed him.

1349
01:16:50,276 --> 01:16:52,089
But then he, someone else is...

1350
01:16:52,113 --> 01:16:53,923
still trying to.

1351
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:55,786
Please, help.

1352
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:56,159
I'll help you, okay.

1353
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:57,094
Okay.

1354
01:16:57,118 --> 01:16:58,385
Okay.

1355
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:04,876
That ridiculous podcast.

1356
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,171
- We were finally getting things
- turned around here,

1357
01:17:06,195 --> 01:17:08,271
- Bringing back the real
- vacationers.

1358
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:10,273
Then these idiots start talking

1359
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:12,274
about this one time incident.

1360
01:17:12,298 --> 01:17:15,326
This one time.

1361
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:17,370
Four people died.

1362
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:22,284
It's a shame.

1363
01:17:22,308 --> 01:17:23,286
Did you live here

1364
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:24,287
back then?

1365
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:27,446
Yeah, still do.

1366
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:28,581
Did you know Russ Thorne?

1367
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,691
No.

1368
01:17:43,596 --> 01:17:47,544
He killed my mother's friends,

1369
01:17:47,568 --> 01:17:51,514
and he tried to kill her.

1370
01:17:51,538 --> 01:17:53,316
But she survived.

1371
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,518
That is why I came here.

1372
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:57,119
I wanted to help her

1373
01:17:57,143 --> 01:17:58,444
get over what happened

1374
01:17:58,468 --> 01:17:59,766
all those years ago,

1375
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:00,947
because I thought that

1376
01:18:00,971 --> 01:18:02,126
it ruined her life.

1377
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:04,245
But then one day I realized

1378
01:18:04,269 --> 01:18:06,362
that she had gotten over it,

1379
01:18:06,386 --> 01:18:08,265
and that it was me

1380
01:18:08,289 --> 01:18:10,166
who ruined her life,

1381
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,353
because if I hadn't been born,

1382
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:14,537
maybe she could've moved on.

1383
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:16,918
But instead she just became

1384
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,296
obsessed with protecting me.

1385
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,544
That is why I came here.

1386
01:18:21,568 --> 01:18:23,931
I wanted to show her that

1387
01:18:23,955 --> 01:18:26,315
she didn't have to worry,

1388
01:18:26,339 --> 01:18:27,768
and that I could take care

1389
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:29,218
of myself.

1390
01:18:29,242 --> 01:18:31,989
Mothers just want to protect

1391
01:18:32,013 --> 01:18:34,781
their children.

1392
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:43,317
You brought over a container

1393
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:45,267
of cookies last night,

1394
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:47,688
and the Wi-Fi password

1395
01:18:47,712 --> 01:18:50,130
changed this morning.

1396
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:57,246
Who the hell are you?

1397
01:18:59,006 --> 01:19:00,716
I'm old!

1398
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:04,477
You hit an old lady!

1399
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:07,790
I'm sorry.

1400
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:15,766
My son deserved better than you

1401
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,300
and your whore friends!

1402
01:19:18,324 --> 01:19:20,870
Your son is Russ?

1403
01:19:20,894 --> 01:19:22,238
I tried to help you.

1404
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:24,174
- I tried to make it easier
- for you

1405
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,409
Like I tried to help

1406
01:19:25,433 --> 01:19:26,642
the other ones.

1407
01:19:26,666 --> 01:19:29,111
You could've gone to sleep,

1408
01:19:29,135 --> 01:19:30,330
then you wouldn't have

1409
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:31,547
tempted him,

1410
01:19:31,571 --> 01:19:33,500
showing yourselves off

1411
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:35,451
like that.

1412
01:19:35,475 --> 01:19:37,604
What was he supposed

1413
01:19:37,628 --> 01:19:39,755
to do?

1414
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:41,608
How about just

1415
01:19:41,632 --> 01:19:43,459
not kill people?

1416
01:19:43,483 --> 01:19:44,695
When did that become

1417
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:45,928
so much to ask?

1418
01:19:45,952 --> 01:19:47,147
He was a grown man,

1419
01:19:47,171 --> 01:19:48,364
an adult,

1420
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:49,466
and we didn't make him

1421
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,566
do anything!

1422
01:19:54,281 --> 01:19:57,970

I don't know, I don't think

it's that bad.

1434
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:53,663
Kay is Russ's mother.

1435
01:20:53,687 --> 01:20:54,864
Oh, my god!

1436
01:20:54,888 --> 01:20:57,533
I knew it. The bastard!

1437
01:20:57,557 --> 01:20:59,169
She's the one after us.

1438
01:20:59,195 --> 01:21:00,454
Is this because I stole

1439
01:21:00,478 --> 01:21:01,737
her beer?

1440
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:04,107
No Alix, this isn't your fault.

1441
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:06,475
This isn't any of our fault.

1442
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:18,754
We can take her.

1443
01:21:18,778 --> 01:21:20,776
With a nail gun?

1444
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,292
I didn't see a nail gun.

1445
01:21:22,316 --> 01:21:23,806
She had a knife, but...

1446
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:28,821
I don't know.

1447
01:21:28,822 --> 01:21:29,883
Alix! Alix!

Get away from my girls!

Mom?

1455

Dana, you didn't call me!

1456
01:21:57,283 --> 01:21:58,779
Mom, we did it.

1457
01:21:58,803 --> 01:22:00,320
We killed Russ Thorne.

1458
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:04,900
I know you.

1459
01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:06,503
You're the bitch who ruined

1460
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:08,104
my son's life.

1461
01:22:08,128 --> 01:22:10,272
I have a name.

1462
01:22:10,296 --> 01:22:12,208
It's Trish Deveraux.

1463
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:13,243
I stopped your son

1464
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:14,276
from killing me.

1465
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,513
- I'm going to stop you
- from killing my daughter.

1466
01:22:16,539 --> 01:22:18,448
- Dana, take your friends
- to the car and leave.

1467
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:19,149
No!

1468
01:22:19,173 --> 01:22:21,084
- We're not going
- without you.

1469
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:22,142
No!

1470
01:22:23,276 --> 01:22:24,755
Ahhhh!!!!!

1471
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:26,589
Get in the car now!

1472
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:27,090
Mom!

1473
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:28,148
Now!

1474
01:22:39,192 --> 01:22:40,536
They owe me!

1475
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,105
They killed my son!

1476
01:22:43,129 --> 01:22:44,774
They owe you nothing.

1477
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:46,397
Russ Thorne was a murderer!

1478
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:48,018
A predator!

1479
01:22:51,204 --> 01:22:53,282
You made him do it.

1480
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:57,844
This stops now!

1481
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:02,158
Huh?

1482
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:03,823
I don't have any feeling

1483
01:23:03,847 --> 01:23:05,486
in this hand.

1484
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:07,076
You can thank your son

1485
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:08,664
for that.

1486
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:20,990
Okay.

1487
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:25,217
- I'm going to go back in
- and help my mom.

1488
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:27,730
Take the keys and go.

1489
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:29,885
Dana.

1490
01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:31,655
She's my mother.

1491
01:23:31,681 --> 01:23:32,956
She is the reason

1492
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,256
that I came here.

1493
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,257
To save her.

1494
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:39,419
So I, I have to save her.

1495
