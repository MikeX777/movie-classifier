1
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:16,040
Thank you.

2
00:00:22,886 --> 00:00:26,002
Thank you so much. I'm so excited
to be here tonight.

3
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:32,407
My name is Richard Gage, AIA. I've been
a practicing architect for 20 years

4
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,520
and I'm a member of the American
Institute of Architects.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,190
I became interested in the World Trade
Center high rise collapses on 9/11

6
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,504
after hearing the startling conclusions
of a reluctant 9/11 researcher,

7
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:50,234
David Ray Griffin, on San Francisco
Bay Area's KPFA radio, Guns and Butter

8
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:53,655
with Bonny Faulkner in March of 2006.

9
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:59,491
This has changed my life radically and
launched my own personal and professional

10
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,937
quest for 9/11 truth, inspiring me to

11
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:07,000
found Architects and Engineers
for 9/11 Truth,

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,730
which now numbers hundreds of architects
and engineers who are demanding

13
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,120
a real investigation into the
destruction of these buildings.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,082
I'm employed with a San Francisco
Bay Area architecture firm,

15
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:24,811
which by the way has no affiliation
with my work in 9/11.

16
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,476
Like many other architects though I
designed numerous fire proofed

17
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:33,237
steel frame buildings in my career, including
these 3 and 10 million dollar gymnasiums

18
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:37,260
and the day to day construction
administration services for this

19
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,508
$120 million high school in
San Ramon in California.

20
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:46,826
I'm now working on a 400 million dollar
project in Nevada with almost 2 million

21
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:52,665
square feet of retail parking structure
and fire proofed steel framed mid rise

22
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:58,580
office space with over 1200 tons of
steel framing all together.

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,947
I'd like to start by thanking each and every
one of you for being willing to consider

24
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:07,798
the very difficult subject of the
destruction of the World Trade Center

25
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:10,637
and its staggering loss of life on 9/11.

26
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:14,710
Just as architecture and engineering
projects are sometimes joyful,

27
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,580
sometimes quite difficult, this particular
project has proven to be

28
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,923
extremely difficult.

29
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:26,153
Not difficult in terms of reaching
conclusions but difficult in terms of

30
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:32,006
the implications of those conclusions and
finding people who are open minded enough

31
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:38,141
to be willing to hear the facts about these
building collapses, check out every fact

32
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:40,157
that we point out.

33
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:44,723
Because it's extremely important that we
know the whole truth about this event.

34
00:02:44,723 --> 00:02:50,212
After all, it served as the pretext for the
invasion of 2 countries in which already

35
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,479
over a million people have perished.

36
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,826
Also as the pretext for the loss of many of
our own cherished liberties here at home

37
00:02:57,826 --> 00:03:01,195
in the United States through
recent legislation

38
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,613
such as the Patriot Act, the Military
Commissions Act and the forthcoming

39
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:10,960
Senate Bill 1959, the Violent Radicalization
and Home Grown Terrorism Act

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,653
in which many of us can be named
a terrorist and have no right

41
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,622
to an attorney or trial by jury.

42
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:25,396
Another 9/11 could happen again if we
don't dedicate ourselves to finding out

43
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:30,900
exactly what happened and why, and to
bringing those actually responsible

44
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,364
to justice.

45
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:38,901
What do I mean it could happen again?
Well, basically we're promised another 9/11

46
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:42,611
by members of the Congress, the media
and the Bush administration

47
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,859
with official statements such as this;

48
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:51,107
"The next attack will make
September 11th pale by comparison",

49
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:55,723
"a nuclear weapon in the middle
of one of our own cities",

50
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,693
"a nuclear terrorist attack on
the U.S. could be imminent",

51
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:04,517
"weapon of mass destruction
- this summer or early fall",

52
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,133
"it'll be much bigger than 9/11",

53
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:15,515
and Michael Chertoff, "a gut feeling
that attacks were imminent",

54
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:21,163
last summer without any evidence
or facts suggesting that.

55
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,972
These are among the many reasons that
we must peer into this painful part

56
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:32,743
of our recent history, to reexamine the
relatively new physical evidence from 9/11

57
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:36,977
which we have not seen in the main stream
media, and to find out why for instance

58
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:45,328
a 2006 poll by the New York Times and CBS
reveals that 28% of Americans believe

59
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:50,311
that the Bush administration is lying,
and not just about Iraq,

60
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:53,489
but about the events of 9/11.

61
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:59,117
And Time Magazine reporting that 36%
of Americans consider it likely

62
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:04,422
or somewhat likely that government officials
either allowed the attacks to be carried out

63
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:07,362
or carried them out themselves.

64
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:15,715
And an even more recent poll from Zogby
in 2007 finding 51% of Americans

65
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:21,254
want Congress to probe the president
and the vice president about 9/11.

66
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:25,968
Of even greater concern, another poll that
year by Scripps Howard Ohio University

67
00:05:25,968 --> 00:05:30,271
which found that a shocking 16%
of Americans  believe

68
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:35,315
that the World Trade Center Twin Towers
were brought down by explosives.

69
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:41,374
NIST, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, claims they found no evidence

70
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,257
for explosive demolition at
the Twin Towers.

71
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,473
Later they admit that they've
never looked for it.

72
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:52,895
How can you find what
you're not looking for?

73
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:57,020
Well, architects, engineers, scientists
and many others looked for it

74
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,929
and it was not hard to find. We've been
speaking about it for 2 years now,

75
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,350
in over 3 dozen cities in a
dozen states and in Canada.

76
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,526
We're proud to be part of the
international 9/11 Truth Movement,

77
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,102
which is growing by millions
every year.

78
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:16,021
We now have hundreds of architects
and engineers for 9/11 Truth

79
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,479
demanding a real investigation.

80
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,877
This is our website.

81
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:23,899
You can find on the right side the bullet
points of information that we're going to be

82
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:28,380
going through today,
it's AE911Truth.org.

83
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,042
On the left side you'll see the Power Point,
you can step through it at your own pace

84
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:36,500
because you may not have time to follow
and  read all the text and absorb

85
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,790
the information that we're rapidly
going to be going through.

86
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:45,121
You can also watch the DVD on the left side
and you can purchase the DVD online.

87
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:50,873
You can sign the petition after you find
yourself convinced that this evidence

88
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,641
is something worth looking at.

89
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,133
Let's get something clear from the start.

90
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:59,841
The ever growing number of architects
and engineers for 9/11 Truth

91
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:02,922
are not
conspiracy theorists.

92
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,114
We're building and technical professionals
looking at the science based

93
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:11,713
forensic  evidence in the destruction
of these high rises on 9/11.

94
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:18,303
As Joel Hirschhorn, PhD says:
"First, let the technical truths emerge.

95
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:24,873
Then, if necessary, cope with the inevitable
conspiracy and other questions".

96
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:29,707
Tonight we're presenting to you the
technical truths, the evidence found

97
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:35,773
for  the explosive demolition of all 3 World
Trade Center high rise collapses on 9/11,

98
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:40,353
the iconic Twin Towers and
the mysterious Building 7.

99
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:48,095
9/11. Just the utterance of it brings us
right back to the terror filled morning.

100
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:51,126
We were subjected to
these shocking attacks,

101
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:54,999
killing thousands of Americans,
destroying cultural icons.

102
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:59,275
These 6 years have given us time to
step back and examine these events

103
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:00,773
more objectively.

104
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:04,951
To step back from the shock
induced trance really, to evaluate

105
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,803
the relatively new evidence that has only
come out in the last couple of years,

106
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:13,921
and to reexamine these 3 high rise
collapses more objectively.

107
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:18,171
Let's begin with an overview of the events
of that morning in order to start us off

108
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,951
on the same page, looking at
the jets and the impacts

109
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:24,002
and how this myth developed.

110
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:28,530
On September  11th we learned that
4 passenger planes were hijacked

111
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,730
and taken radically off course.

112
00:08:31,337 --> 00:08:35,616
Within an hour 2 of the planes were thrown
into the enormous steel towers

113
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:40,766
at the World Trade Center, creating fires
and eventually toppling them.

114
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:54,305
Dazed by the news the American public
soon believed that the fires in the towers

115
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:59,318
had burned so hot that they caused the
steel  frames of the buildings to give way.

116
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:13,725
A myth developed fed by official sources
trough the media to a bewildered audience.

117
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:26,103
Elements of the myth; the impact of
the airplanes, gallons of burning jet fuel,

118
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:31,260
steel melting, the buildings failing
and suddenly imploding.

119
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:39,004
In a mere 10 seconds 110 stories hurdled
earthwards, pulverizing into dust.

120
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:45,933
Right from the start on the street
itself the official story was born.

121
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:50,242
come out of nowhere and just reamed
right into the side of the Twin Tower,

122
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:52,393
exploding through the other side,

123
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:55,686
and then I witnessed both towers collapse,
one first and then the second,

124
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:59,217
mostly due to structural failure because
the fire was just too intense

125
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,255
We need to look for these kinds of people
and these kinds of events that are

126
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:09,227
the first ones interviewed by the main
stream media, planting the official story

127
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:12,137
in the minds of people.

128
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:22,427
The myth bled into the FEMA report
and was echoed by the experts.

129
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:29,600
It was the combination of the impact load
doing great damage to the building,

130
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,916
followed by the fire,
that caused collapse.

131
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,948
Well, let's take a look at that.

132
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,165
What we do is to apply the scientific
method which many of us learned

133
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,369
in 7th and 8th grade.

134
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:48,117
It's the best way yet discovered for
winnowing truth from lies and delusion.

135
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:51,152
The simple version looks
something like this.

136
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:55,729
We formulate a question;
how did the Twin Towers collapse?

137
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:59,660
We perform research,
we make observations.

138
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,573
We construct a hypothesis;
we have an idea how it collapsed.

139
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:09,580
It collapsed by fire. It collapsed by
explosive controlled demolition.

140
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,412
We make some predictions and we test
those predictions and those assumptions

141
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:18,539
with experiments, objective, verifiable,
repeatable experiments.

142
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,732
We analyze the results and
we draw conclusions.

143
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:28,402
And if those conclusions are found to be
corroborated by the evidence we report it

144
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:34,137
in an open, transparent manner, where
our experiments and our findings

145
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:35,478
can be repeated.

146
00:11:35,838 --> 00:11:42,990
If it is not found to be corroborated
we think and try again and construct

147
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,696
a new hypothesis with new
observations, new research.

148
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:52,451
Buildings are destroyed by a number of
different forces, each of which have

149
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:56,111
very different and
identifiable characteristics.

150
00:11:56,111 --> 00:12:02,421
For instance, fires affect buildings quite
differently than controlled demolition.

151
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:07,866
Fires, by their nature, tend to creep from
place to place as they run out of fuel,

152
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:13,004
moving to fresh, new fuel sources,
leaving the burned down area to cool.

153
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:17,916
So when collapses do occur, and by the way
you'll note that they've never occurred

154
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:24,032
in over a hundred examples of very hot,
very large and very long lasting fires.

155
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:28,910
Buildings tend to fall over,
they fall asymmetrically,

156
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,613
they're burned out on
one side organically if you will.

157
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,313
It's a natural process.

158
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:38,841
They don't fall straight down
through the path of greatest resistance.

159
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:44,167
Let's listen to Jonathan Barnett
from FEMA talk about what fires

160
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,198
are expected to do in steel buildings.

161
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:51,299
The way in which steel framed
buildings behave in fires

162
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,346
depends on their construction.

163
00:12:53,881 --> 00:13:00,086
In this test, done by British Steel in 1995
a large amount of typical office furniture

164
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:03,483
was burned to see what would happen
to the heavy steel beams

165
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,282
that supported the ceiling.

166
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:14,183
When steel is bare, when it heats up it
gets weaker. It's not that it melts in a fire.

167
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:19,467
In fact, normal fires aren't
hot enough to melt steel.

168
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:26,420
Even if you were for example to
use an unusual fuel like kerosene

169
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,022
you cannot achieve temperatures
hot enough to melt steel.

170
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:32,731
But what happens is that it
starts to lose its strength.

171
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:37,208
And as it's loses its strength
it starts to sag,

172
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:43,390
it becomes softer and sags and
can no longer support load.

173
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,884
This was the largest test of
its kind ever conducted.

174
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:54,265
It showed how unprotected steel can be
distorted, even by a normal office fire.

175
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:59,739
But as is typical in steel buildings
the structural beams only slowly

176
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,421
and progressively warped and sagged.

177
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,414
There was no chance of a sudden collapse.

178
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:14,515
In over 20 years I have not seen until
recently a protected steel structure

179
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,521
that has collapsed in a fire.

180
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:22,285
So what was the cause of the
devastating, explosive failure that

181
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:24,510
happened to the World Trade Center?

182
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:30,650
These particular buildings collapsed.
They follow the path of least resistance

183
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:32,837
Or they fell over.

184
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:36,133
You can see that the building
structure holds the building together

185
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,251
in some recognizable form.

186
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,806
The structural elements have not been
dismembered from each other

187
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:45,435
and their concrete has not
been pulverized into dust.

188
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:50,376
They follow the path of least
resistance, which is generally over.

189
00:14:50,382 --> 00:14:52,452
These buildings exploded.

190
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:57,890
Witnesses hear sounds of explosions,
they see flashes of light.

191
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,863
There's thick, billowing and enormous
pyroclastic clouds of pulverized concrete.

192
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:09,435
The expansion of the gasses very quickly
produces this cauliflower-like formation

193
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:12,229
that we see in the smoke.

194
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:19,034
This is a controlled demolition. Let's
focus on this type of destruction first.

195
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:22,840
We have hundreds of examples from
all across the country from which to make

196
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,589
our comparison because it's the most
commonly used method to demolish

197
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:27,910
high rises.

198
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,705
This is what a high rise looks like when
it's being demolished with explosives.

199
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:35,490
Controlled demolitions can be
engineered in many different ways.

200
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,589
Normally the purpose of a controlled
demolition is to remove a structure while

201
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:44,456
avoiding damage to adjacent
structures and to do so economically.

202
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:48,498
Typically a tall building like this is
demolished by placing thousands of

203
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:52,922
cutter charges throughout the columns
and beams in the building and then

204
00:15:52,922 --> 00:15:57,754
detonating them in a very precise order,
starting with the interior structures

205
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:03,130
and then progressing outward,
synchronistically timed, floor by floor.

206
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,304
Destroying the interior columns
allows the unsupported weight

207
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:09,866
to pull the exterior inward.

208
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:15,883
Destroying the building from the ground
up allows the weight of the building

209
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:18,543
to be harnessed to do much
of the destruction.

210
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:24,004
So the result is an implosion producing
a vertical, symmetrical collapse

211
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:29,672
at free fall speed into a consolidated
rubble pile that's broken up

212
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:31,773
and ready for loading and shipment.

213
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:36,693
Now this is a feat that only a handful of
companies in the United States

214
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:38,520
can accomplish.

215
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:43,872
Let's look at some of the key
characteristics of controlled demolition.

216
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:48,052
First we have a sudden onset of
destruction at the base of the structure.

217
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:53,685
We have straight down, symmetrical
collapse into its own footprint

218
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:58,351
because demolition waves
remove the column support

219
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,548
resulting in a free fall speed,
virtually, through the path

220
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:08,196
of what was the greatest resistance,
thousands of tons of structural steel.

221
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:12,069
We have a total dismemberment of
the steel structure, so it's loaded

222
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,290
and ready for shipment.

223
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,695
We have minimal damage to adjacent
structures, sounds and flashes

224
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:24,986
of explosions, heard and seen by witnesses,
enormous clouds of pulverized concrete.

225
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:30,859
Squibs sometimes, explosive charges
that go off at the wrong time.

226
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:34,515
Chemical evidence of cutter charges.

227
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:39,965
These are all fairly typical and they
go to show us direct evidence

228
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,486
of explosive destruction.

229
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:47,327
Now, the interesting thing is that
not one of these typical characteristics

230
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:53,445
of controlled demolition can be
explained or accounted for by fire,

231
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:56,013
let alone all ten of them.

232
00:17:56,493 --> 00:18:00,163
Typically we have government
documentation, expert corroboration,

233
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:03,867
foreknowledge and video documentation
all of which supports

234
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:07,162
the hypothesis of controlled demolition.

235
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:10,912
Providing proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

236
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:15,155
Let's take a look at World
Trade Center 7 now.

237
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:23,085
It was 47 stories tall, what would've been
the tallest building in 33 of our states.

238
00:18:23,085 --> 00:18:29,414
Half the height of the Twin Towers,
dwarfed only by its proximity to what was,

239
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:33,328
for a couple of years the
tallest buildings in the world.

240
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:36,942
It was not hit by an airplane.

241
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:42,127
It was the 3rd World Trade Center
high rise to collapse on 9/11

242
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:44,728
at about 5.20 in the afternoon.

243
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:48,432
World Trade Center 7 was hit
by debris from the North Tower,

244
00:18:48,432 --> 00:18:52,856
you can see it being pelted here,
and it sustained about 8 fires,

245
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:55,568
according to NIST, on various floors.

246
00:18:55,692 --> 00:19:01,056
This is the World Trade Center 7,
47 stories high, don't be confused

247
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,933
by the shadow from this building.

248
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:07,974
Here we have the 13th and 14th floor fires
and the 7th floor fire on the North side

249
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:13,242
of the building, the opposite side of the
building that was pelted by the North Tower.

250
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,454
Curiously enough, the Securities and
Exchange Commission was operating

251
00:19:17,454 --> 00:19:21,298
out of this floor which lost thousands
of files related to hundreds of cases

252
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:26,441
it was actively pursuing against Wall Street
companies like Enron and Worldcom.

253
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:32,877
So we are looking for an investigation that
goes well beyond the buildings, of course.

254
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:36,996
Now let's take a look at the evidence
of World Trade Center 7 and see

255
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:41,500
how it stacks up against the typical
features of a controlled demolition,

256
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,525
starting with is there
a sudden offset of destruction?

257
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,034
Let's listen to this emergency worker.

258
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,598
We were watching the building (WTC7)
actually cuz it was on fire

259
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:52,955
The bottom floors of the
building were on fire and 

260
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:56,806
we heard this sound that
sounded like a clap of thunder 

261
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,302
turned around- we were shocked
to see that the building was ah,

262
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:04,332
well, it looked like there was a shockwave
ripping through the building

263
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:08,874
and the windows all busted out
it was horrifying

264
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:15,558
About a second later the bottom floor caved
out and the building followed after that

265
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:19,237
we saw the building crash down
all the way to the ground

266
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:21,569
we were in shock

267
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:25,836
A sound of a clap of thunder?
A shock wave ripping through the building?

268
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:27,327
And windows busting out?

269
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,078
And then the building coming down.

270
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:35,763
Do we have a straight down, symmetrical
collapse into the building's footprint?

271
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:40,070
Let's listen to Dan Rather narrate this
collapse for us as we take our first look

272
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,762
at the collapse of Building 7.

273
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,014
What you're seeing are high shots.

274
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:49,610
Now here were going to show you
a video tape of the collapse itself.

275
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:52,898
Now we go to video tape of
the collapse of this building.

276
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:00,925
It's amazing

277
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:04,509
Amazing, incredible, pick your word.

278
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:06,856
For the third time today

279
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:11,225
It's reminiscent of those pictures we've
all seen too much on television before

280
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:16,047
when a building was deliberately destroyed
by well placed dynamite to knock it down.

281
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:20,299
What, Dan? Deliberately destroyed by
well placed dynamite to knock it down?

282
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,205
Dan never repeated these
words after this first day.

283
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:28,223
In fact, we didn't see this building
coming down after 9/11.

284
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:30,749
Let's take a look from West Street.

285
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,417
Maybe we haven't quite
understood yet what's going on.

286
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:48,914
Well, I'm not quite convinced yet, let's
take a look in this side by side comparison

287
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:51,929
with a known controlled demolition
on the right.

288
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:08,500
Did the building fall into
its own footprint?

289
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,481
Petty much so, a little bit of
overlapping into the street,

290
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,941
I could've done a much better job myself.

291
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:16,841
A tidy rubble pile nevertheless.

292
00:22:16,842 --> 00:22:21,178
Do we have demolition waves and how
do these remove the column support?

293
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:25,664
Well, here's a floor plan of Building 7.

294
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:31,070
Now, to bring a building smoothly,
symmetrically into its own footprint

295
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,515
without falling over, what we have
to do  is remove the core columns

296
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:40,625
because what we want to do is to bring
the  outside of the building in on itself.

297
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:46,779
This involves a high degree of
precision that fire is not capable of,

298
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:48,854
being an organic process.

299
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:55,902
We're told by NIST in a December 18th
update meeting that we attended via telecon,

300
00:22:55,902 --> 00:23:04,238
that there's virtually no influence
in the collapse from the debris

301
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:08,663
from the North Tower or the damage
caused by it, or from the diesel

302
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:13,036
that may have been
spilling out of the diesel line.

303
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:18,202
Why? Well, the East penthouse is the
first part of the building to collapse

304
00:23:18,202 --> 00:23:21,368
a few seconds before
the global collapse.

305
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:26,667
And so NIST is now targeting column nr. 79.

306
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,400
And so that's where they
say the collapse initiated.

307
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:38,105
Do we have a free fall speed of collapse
through the path of greatest resistance?

308
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:41,014
Let's listen to David Chandler.

309
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:46,104
We can measure the downward acceleration
of Building 7 by video frame analysis.

310
00:23:46,783 --> 00:23:52,427
I used a magnifying glass to place markers
on the corner of the building on each frame.

311
00:23:53,315 --> 00:23:56,919
From this we can get a
data table and various graphs.

312
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,840
The slope of this graph indicates
acceleration which is shown here to be

313
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,334
about minus 10.279, plus or minus 0.6.

314
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:11,564
Free fall in a vacuum is
minus 9.8 in these units.

315
00:24:11,564 --> 00:24:15,034
That falls within the margin
of error of this measurement.

316
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:19,773
In other words, the rate of fall of
Building 7 in the first few seconds

317
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:23,510
is indistinguishable from
free fall in a vacuum.

318
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:25,088
What are we talking about?

319
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:31,273
You can see, second by second, the building
gaining downward momentum.

320
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:37,804
You can plot the drop distance on the graph
of time and it fits the free fall curve

321
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:39,511
almost perfectly.

322
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,745
What does this mean?

323
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,478
That the columns had to
have been removed, and removed

324
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:49,440
vitually simultaneously, on each floor,
synchronistically timed,

325
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,328
so the building had no resistance,
virtually, on the way down.

326
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:58,907
Do we have a total dismemberment
of the structure?

327
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:07,126
We had a 47 storey skyscraper, compressed
to 4 stories. How does this happen?

328
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:11,896
This building had some moment
resisting frames on several floors.

329
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:17,060
That's where the beams are welded
very rigidly to the columns.

330
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:21,458
Do we have sounds of explosions?

331
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:24,806
Here's Craig  Bartmer from the
New York Police Department.

332
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:28,747
And the whole time you're hearing
thoom thoom thoom thoom.

333
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:35,028
So, eh I think I know an
explosion when I hear it.

334
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:38,227
I was real close to Building 7
when it fell down.

335
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:42,504
That didn't sound like just
a building falling down to me

336
00:25:42,504 --> 00:25:44,186
while I was running away from it.

337
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:49,443
There's a lot of eye witness testimony
down there hearing explosions.

338
00:25:49,588 --> 00:25:52,391
I didn't see any reason for that
building to fall down the way it did.

339
00:25:52,391 --> 00:25:56,176
And a lot of guys should be
saying the same thing.

340
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:00,974
How about Kevin McPadden,
former Air Force Special Operations

341
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,429
Search and Rescue?

342
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:07,929
He came back over with his hand over the
radio and what sounded like a countdown.

343
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:13,295
And at the last few seconds he took
his hand of and you heard 3.2.1.,

344
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:16,141
and he was just saying
"just run for your life",

345
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:21,433
and then it was like another 2 or 3
seconds, you heard explosions

346
00:26:21,668 --> 00:26:24,009
like BABOOOOMMMM,

347
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:25,727
like a distinct sound.

348
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:29,630
It's not like when with compression,
like booom booom booom,

349
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,205
like floors that were
dropping and collapsing.

350
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:36,018
This was like BABOOOOM,
like you felt a rumble in the ground,

351
00:26:36,018 --> 00:26:38,415
like almost like you wanted
to grab on to something.

352
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:44,189
That, to me, I know that was an explosion.
There was no doubt in my mind.

353
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:45,842
OK, thank you, Kevin.

354
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:53,191
Do we have enormous clouds of pyroclastic
smoke from the pulverized concrete?

355
00:26:53,428 --> 00:27:00,324
Watch the concrete entrained in the air
racing down every street in each direction

356
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:09,914
at 35 miles an hour, this incredible volume
of pyroclastic dust and folding itself.

357
00:27:10,313 --> 00:27:16,899
It takes incredible quantities of heat
to create this kind of action.

358
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,885
A lot more heat than these 8 various
fires that were on these floors.

359
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,974
Do we have pools of molten iron?

360
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,455
Let's start with the South Tower now.

361
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:31,968
This section applies to the World Trade
Center Twin Towers and Building 7.

362
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:38,837
We're told by NIST that this substance
must be melted aluminum from the airplane.

363
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:45,948
But melted aluminum looks
like melted aluminum, it's silvery.

364
00:27:45,948 --> 00:27:50,033
It doesn't glow in day like conditions.

365
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:54,267
"As of 21 days after the attack,
the fires were still burning

366
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:59,743
and molten steel was still running", says
World Trade Center structural engineer

367
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:06,488
Leslie Robertson to a conference of
structural engineers on October 5th 2001,

368
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:08,624
one month after 9/11.

369
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:11,855
"Fires burned and molten metal
flowed in the pile of ruins

370
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:15,678
still settling beneath my feet",
says Sarah Atlas.

371
00:28:15,678 --> 00:28:20,676
What do the first responders and demolition
contractors say about molten metal?

372
00:28:20,676 --> 00:28:23,796
"Saw pools of literally molten steel."

373
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:27,176
"Molten metal, beams had
just totally been melted."

374
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:32,043
"It was dripping from the molten steel."
"Steel flowed in molten streams."

375
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,438
"They're finding molten steel."
"Seeing the molten steel."

376
00:28:36,438 --> 00:28:38,987
"Uncovering red hot metal beams."

377
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:42,462
"Molten metal, red hot
weeks after the event."

378
00:28:42,462 --> 00:28:45,195
"Molten steel at the heart
of the tower's remains."

379
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:46,964
"Molten steel beams."

380
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:49,752
"The streams of molten metal
that leaked from the hot cores

381
00:28:49,752 --> 00:28:51,346
and flowed down the broken walls."

382
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:53,790
"Molten metal dripping from a beam."

383
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,692
"The end of the beam would
be dripping with molten steel."

384
00:28:57,692 --> 00:29:01,672
And this structural engineer,
Abolhassan Astaneh-Asi from Berkeley

385
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,399
cites and documents:

386
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:06,929
"I saw melting of girders in
the World Trade Center."

387
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:11,214
"Still so hot that molten metal dripped
down the sides of the wall

388
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:12,653
from Building 6."

389
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,282
"Debris past the columns was
red hot, molten, running."

390
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:21,051
"A fire truck 10 feet below the ground
that was still burning 2 weeks

391
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,623
after the Tower collapsed, its metal
so hot that it looked like

392
00:29:24,623 --> 00:29:26,586
a vat of molten steel."

393
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:29,162
"Pieces of steel, still cherry red."

394
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:34,129
One of the more unusual artifacts to emerge
from the rubble is this rocklike object

395
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:36,665
that has come to be known
as the Meteorite.

396
00:29:36,936 --> 00:29:44,074
This is fused element of steel, molten steel
and concrete and all of these things,

397
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,761
all of them fused by the heat.

398
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:49,848
And architects and engineers,
people who work with steel, welders,

399
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:54,703
have just never seen the level of
destruction and the level of deformation

400
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:56,728
of this material in our lives.

401
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:03,220
These cooled meteorites are not
aluminum because aluminum doesn't rust.

402
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,054
It's not a melted airplane.

403
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:10,552
What does the gentleman in charge of the
clean up at World Trade Center Ground Zero

404
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:12,693
have to say about molten metal?

405
00:30:12,693 --> 00:30:15,955
Mark Loizeaux, the president
of Controlled Demolition inc.,

406
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:19,157
told the American Free Press that in
the basements of the World Trade Center,

407
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:23,149
where 47 central support columns
connected to the bedrock, hot spots

408
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:27,738
of literally molten steel were discovered
more than a month after September 11th.

409
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:31,350
These incredibly hot areas were found at
the bottoms of the elevator shafts,

410
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,168
down 7 basement levels.

411
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:37,314
The molten steel was found 3,
4 and 5 weeks later,

412
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:38,902
when the rubble was being removed.

413
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:42,989
He said that molten steel
was also found at WTC7.

414
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:46,887
The highest temperature was at
the East corner of the South Tower

415
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:51,032
where a temperature of 1377
degrees  Fahrenheit was recorded.

416
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:54,930
The molten steel in the basement was
more than double that temperature.

417
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,744
What are we talking about here?
Here is Building 7, at A and B,

418
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:02,696
and here is the North Tower
and the South Tower.

419
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:07,819
These hot spots are
1340 to 1370 degrees.

420
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:11,923
These are the temperatures
of the hottest office fires.

421
00:31:11,923 --> 00:31:18,268
There was no fire on the surface
of Ground Zero after the collapses.

422
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:20,069
What are we measuring here?

423
00:31:20,104 --> 00:31:24,228
We're measuring the molten metal
that was seen by these first responders

424
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:30,141
4, 5, 6 stories down below in the
basements that were surely at least

425
00:31:30,141 --> 00:31:32,982
twice or 3 times these temperatures.

426
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:40,698
What's the problem with that?
Office fires, Eager says, 1200 degrees.

427
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:46,220
NIST claims 1800 degrees, for which
we have no evidence for office fires

428
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,534
of that temperature
in the Trade Center Towers.

429
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:55,761
But for something salmon or lemon
colored it's 15-18 hundred degrees.

430
00:31:56,069 --> 00:32:03,608
And structural steel doesn't even begin
to melt until 2700 or so degrees...

431
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:11,408
We're missing 1000 to 2000 degrees
of temperature, heat energy required

432
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:13,066
to produce this stuff.

433
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:19,380
Where is it coming from? We'll be
taking a look at a possible suspect,

434
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,771
thermite, which reaches
temperatures of 4500 degrees.

435
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:32,637
Molten metal flowing off this substance
held in the jaws of this backhoe.

436
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:37,654
Now, let's listen to John Gross,
lead engineer of NIST,

437
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:42,445
tell us about the molten
metal from his perspective.

438
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:52,216
I'm curious about the pool of molten steel
that was found in the bottom of the Towers.

439
00:32:52,518 --> 00:32:56,618
I am too, please tell me about it,
have you seen it?

440
00:32:56,618 --> 00:33:02,372
Well, not personally, but eye witnesses
there found huge pools of molten steel

441
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:08,854
beneath the Towers and some scientists
don't think that the collapse

442
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,739
of the building could have
melted all that steel.

443
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,631
A physics professor analyzed
some of this steel, Steven Jones,

444
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:25,459
and he found evidence of thermate residue,
which would explain how the buildings

445
00:33:25,459 --> 00:33:28,698
collapsed by means of
pre planted explosives.

446
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,974
So, have you analyzed the
steel for these residues?

447
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:39,138
Eh, first of all let's get back to your basic
premise that there was a pool

448
00:33:39,138 --> 00:33:40,714
of molten steel.

449
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,198
I know absolutely nobody,
no eye witnesses said so,

450
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:45,501
nobody who's produced it.

451
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:50,845
You'd get down below and you'd
see molten steel, molten steel

452
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:55,047
running down the channel rails,
like you're in a foundry.

453
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,588
Like lave from a volcano.

454
00:33:58,588 --> 00:34:03,726
Out on the rubble I believe
it's still 11oo degrees.

455
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:07,910
The guy's boots just melt
within a few hours."

456
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:10,104
This is how it's been since day one.

457
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:13,270
It's unbelievable,
this is 6 weeks later,

458
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:17,534
and as we get closer to the center
it gets hotter and hotter.

459
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:19,510
It's probably 1500 degrees.

460
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,927
We've had some small windows into what
we thought was the core at some point

461
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:27,653
and it looks like an oven,
it was just roaring inside.

462
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:30,223
Just a bright, bright reddish, orange color.

463
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:34,115
Underground it was still so hot that molten
metal dripped down the sides of the wall

464
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:35,388
from Building 6.

465
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:40,136
I know absolutely nobody, no eye witnesses
said so, nobody who's produced it.

466
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:42,430
What is the problem here?

467
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:49,335
We have plenty of eye
witnesses that have produced it.

468
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:54,232
Somebody is lying. I'm going to leave it up
to you to make your own conclusions.

469
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:00,801
"The last fire was not even extinguished  for
3 months after 9/11." Tom Manley says:

470
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:03,864
"You couldn't even begin to imagine
how much water was pumped in there.

471
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,952
It was like you were
creating a giant lake."

472
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:12,734
Well, thermite contains its own source of
oxygen, it burns just as well under water.

473
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:19,980
How about chemical evidence though?
What produced all this molten metal?

474
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,449
And what is thermite anyway?

475
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:27,201
Thermite. An incendiary used
by the military, thermite is a

476
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:31,045
compound of iron dioxide and
aluminum which, when ignited,

477
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:36,065
sustains an extreme heat reaction,
creating molten iron.

478
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:42,585
In just 2 seconds thermite can reach
temperatures over 4500 degrees Fahrenheit,

479
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:46,150
quite enough to liquefy steel.

480
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:51,913
We know that open air fires cannot
burn hot enough to melt steel,

481
00:35:51,913 --> 00:35:54,844
but metal had melted at
the base of the towers.

482
00:35:56,438 --> 00:36:00,426
Appendix C of the FEMA report
describes sulphur residues

483
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:02,599
on the World Trade Center steel.

484
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:07,458
The New York Times called this
the deepest mystery of all.

485
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:13,579
Sulphur slightly lowers the melting point
of iron, and iron oxide and iron sulphite

486
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:17,154
had formed on the surface
of the structural steel.

487
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:23,884
Sulphur used with thermite is called
thermate, producing even faster results.

488
00:36:26,335 --> 00:36:32,958
NFPA 921 is the guide for fire and
explosion investigations. Was it used?

489
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:37,709
They say: "Unusual residues could
arise from thermite, magnesium

490
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,083
or other pyrotechnic materials."

491
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:47,357
At a crime scene, where this was an
example of, did NIST used this guide? No,

492
00:36:47,357 --> 00:36:51,894
They acknowledged they didn't even
look for such evidence. But others did.

493
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:57,855
Dr. Steven Jones performed chemical
analysis on the previously molten metal.

494
00:36:57,855 --> 00:37:02,673
He did some background research,
again, part of the scientific method.

495
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:06,380
Thermite would create a characteristic
burn pattern with a white ash,

496
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:12,079
a white yellow hot liquid metal and
intense white reaction zone seen.

497
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:15,255
It would also leave behind
chemical evidence.

498
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:18,987
Common elements such as iron,
aluminum, copper, calcium, silicon.

499
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:25,739
Unusual elements such as fluorine and
manganese left behind also in the residue.

500
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,442
These elements here.

501
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:34,223
He's sent a sample of this 40 pound
chunk of previously molten metal

502
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:36,086
from one of those 'meteorites'.

503
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:42,635
He finds that it's predominantly iron so we
can rule out aluminum from the jet plane.

504
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:47,152
It has small amounts of
aluminum, sulphur and potassium.

505
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:51,977
And manganese and
fluorine in abundance.

506
00:37:51,977 --> 00:37:55,962
The manganese is from the potassium
permanganate, commonly used

507
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,291
as an oxidizer in thermite.

508
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:04,835
Fluorine is also used in sol-gel
type thermite charges.

509
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:08,891
So these appear to be
the thermite fingerprint.

510
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:14,634
Let's take a look at what else dr. Jones
found in the slag from this memorial

511
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:17,074
at Clarkston University.

512
00:38:17,074 --> 00:38:22,670
He performs his x-ray fluorescence
on this small piece of slag and finds,

513
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,898
once again, iron, sulphur,
potassium, manganese, calcium.

514
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:34,348
Gel explosives are a super thermite,
tiny aluminum particles in iron oxide,

515
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:39,102
in this sol-gel, they can be
cast into shape, like clay.

516
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:43,409
Lawrence Livermore Labs did research
on this and this invention offers

517
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:47,246
"a thermite based apparatus
for cutting target materials."

518
00:38:47,246 --> 00:38:53,775
You pack the thermite in here and you ignite
it and it comes out and it's forced through,

519
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:59,557
melting the structural steel
element in fractions of a second.

520
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:05,436
Almost as effective as high
energy explosives, RDX and C4

521
00:39:05,436 --> 00:39:09,399
which are more common in
classic controlled demolitions.

522
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:15,039
If sol-gels were used they would
leave behind a very unique signature,

523
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,633
1,3-diphenylpropane.

524
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:23,940
And in fact EPA finds one molecule
in their toxilogical studies

525
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,829
at levels that dwarfed all others,
1,3-diphenylpropane.

526
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:35,781
Erik Swartz says "we've never observed it
in any other sampling we've ever done."

527
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:40,929
But is there evidence of
thermite in the WTC dust?

528
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:46,311
Dr. Jones received no less than
4 separate samples of WTC dust,

529
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:50,175
some of it from an apartment across
the street, Janet McKinley's apartment,

530
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:54,753
where the windows blew in and filled
her apartment with a foot of this dust.

531
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:59,176
Another sample was found like 10
minutes later on the Brooklyn Bridge.

532
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:04,670
Well, he takes it and put a magnet over it
and he finds that there are small particles

533
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:10,333
that come up to the magnet. Some of
them are angular, some of them are round.

534
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,358
They look like this.

535
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:18,692
In fact, he calculates by the weight of
the amount of these spheres that he finds

536
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:23,869
in the dust that there must have been
about 10 tons for all of the dust

537
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,461
that was available.

538
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:31,197
They're about a 16th of an inch in diameter,
the largest ones, and most of them though

539
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:36,304
are smaller than a human hair. What
could produce such an incredible array

540
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:37,645
of microspheres?

541
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:42,156
Well, if you had thousands of cutter
charges going off in the columns and beams

542
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:48,230
throughout the building and they're
under this incredible pressure,

543
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,927
what you would see
is something like this.

544
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:56,151
Tens of thousands or
millions of tiny droplets.

545
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:58,905
What's the shape of those droplets?

546
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:04,367
When a liquid is dispersed like this its
surface tension forms itself into almost

547
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:05,637
a perfect sphere.

548
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:09,915
In the case of molten iron
those droplets cool and they fall,

549
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:12,212
along with the dust, everywhere.

550
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:16,668
He compares the spheres to
a known thermite experiment,

551
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:22,464
performed by John Parulis in Nevada,
which finds the same spheres.

552
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:27,957
In fact, we do another X-EDS
and we find in the microspheres

553
00:41:27,957 --> 00:41:30,913
the same kinds of evidence.

554
00:41:30,913 --> 00:41:38,820
We have iron, manganese, and, in the
case of this known thermite signature,

555
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,310
it matches basically.

556
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,666
In other words, we have a controlled
experiment to compare the results against.

557
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:50,425
And for those who know how to read
these graphs such as dr. Jones and others,

558
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,007
this is pretty much an exact
match indicating that this is

559
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:55,636
the signature of thermite.

560
00:41:55,636 --> 00:42:00,119
Dr. Jones is not the only one who
finds these iron rich microspheres.

561
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,893
The EPA finds them in all the dust and
the toxilogical studies that they're doing.

562
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:06,769
They have no idea
where they came from,

563
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:11,748
they don't report the results other
than just a tiny bit, they're curious.

564
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:17,369
They sweep it under the rug. It has
only one possible formation and that is

565
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,421
from liquid molten iron
under extreme pressure.

566
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:26,904
RJ Lee finds the iron rich microspheres
on top of the Deutsche Bank building

567
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:29,697
in their toxilogical studies.

568
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:35,968
Is this what corroded the tops of these
cars, this atomized thermite cooling?

569
00:42:36,101 --> 00:42:41,154
Manganese was also found in
large proportions, very toxic stuff,

570
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:45,209
from the city's Chief Medical Examiner,
very very concerned about it.

571
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:49,899
Dr. Jones concludes that given the mix
of trace metals present in these

572
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:54,592
high concentrations in the dust
such as zinc, copper and manganese

573
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:57,640
and the formation of
iron rich aluminum spheres

574
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,633
it's clear that significant aluminothermic
reactions occur and he can

575
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:06,384
reverse engineer this and suggests
to us that there must have been

576
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:11,223
in the thermite mix powders of
aluminum, iron oxide, copper oxide,

577
00:43:11,223 --> 00:43:14,175
zinc nitrate and
potassium permanganate.

578
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:23,197
Well, would there possibly be any
unignited thermite pieces in the WTC dust?

579
00:43:23,197 --> 00:43:24,364
Indeed he finds it.

580
00:43:24,364 --> 00:43:27,513
It also comes up to his magnet
from the dust samples.

581
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:28,777
Many chips.

582
00:43:28,777 --> 00:43:33,287
This one is a 16th of an inch long,
red on one side, grey on the other.

583
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:39,814
The red side is composed of tiny
iron oxide particles and aluminum.

584
00:43:39,978 --> 00:43:43,576
In fact, he does an X-EDS
on this stuff too.

585
00:43:43,576 --> 00:43:49,280
And he finds a little bit of sulphur, more
aluminum, lots of iron and manganese.

586
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,509
Compare that to the traditional thermite,
it's also a match for unignited thermite.

587
00:43:57,073 --> 00:44:01,862
This stuff is not made
in a cave in Afghanistan.

588
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:07,865
The Lawrence Livermore Lab came out with
papers only a year or 2 ago about this stuff.

589
00:44:07,865 --> 00:44:14,152
The particles, being so small, allow for
almost instantaneous ignition between

590
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:20,225
the 2 chemicals, the aluminum and the iron
oxide, producing very explosive results.

591
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:25,851
Los Alamos Lab and Lawrence Livermore
Lab have produced these results.

592
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:31,988
Then he continues his study and finds
additional chips that are partially ignited,

593
00:44:31,988 --> 00:44:37,747
with spheres embedded in them,
indicating that the source of the spheres is,

594
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:43,603
for all intents and purposes,
identified very clearly here.

595
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,618
Partially reacted thermite.

596
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,324
These results are documented
in a peer reviewed journal,

597
00:44:56,324 --> 00:45:00,466
in the Open Civil Engineering
Journal, volume 2.

598
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:06,254
'14 Points of agreement', he calls it,
'with official government reports on the

599
00:45:06,254 --> 00:45:10,165
World Trade Center destruction', because
it turns out that there is much in common

600
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:15,948
between the NIST report, the FEMA
report and the work that we are doing.

601
00:45:15,948 --> 00:45:21,575
And of course there's a lot of disagreement
as well. But dr. Jones is an optimist.

602
00:45:21,575 --> 00:45:23,821
So we're going to look
for the points of agreement.

603
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,183
He has also documented this in
'Applying the Scientific Method',

604
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:31,266
which is on our website www.AETruth.org,

605
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:34,267
also on
www.JournalOf911Studies.com.

606
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:39,846
With dr. Jones and his small team of
scientists, through EDS, XRF and WDS,

607
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:45,789
identifies the components of these spheres
and chips predominantly iron, along with

608
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:50,009
aluminum, oxygen and silicon,
1,3-diphenylpropane,

609
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:54,051
the results coupled with the visual
evidence, he says, at the scene such as

610
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:58,690
the flowing hot liquid metal
providing compelling evidence

611
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,382
that thermite reaction compounds
were deliberately placed

612
00:46:01,382 --> 00:46:06,206
in both WTC towers and Building 7.

613
00:46:06,272 --> 00:46:09,619
Verify the results please.

614
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:13,121
This must be repeatable,
there's lots of dust out there.

615
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:20,062
We encourage anyone who has any
samples of this dust to email us at

616
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:26,032
WTCdust@AE911Truth.org so that we
can get repeatable samplings done.

617
00:46:26,032 --> 00:46:27,861
We need a lot of this.

618
00:46:28,376 --> 00:46:33,611
Now all of this is direct evidence of
explosive destruction in Building 7.

619
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,512
We're going to jump back
to only Building 7 now.

620
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:43,787
None of these characteristics can be
explained by fire, let alone all of them.

621
00:46:44,378 --> 00:46:48,003
Why? Well, buildings are
protected from fire.

622
00:46:48,003 --> 00:46:51,703
High rise steel frame buildings in particular
have 2 and 3 hour fire protection,

623
00:46:51,703 --> 00:46:55,103
designed to allow the
occupants to escape a fire.

624
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:59,557
But even after, in fires that are
much longer than 2 hours, larger,

625
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:01,572
these buildings have not collapsed.

626
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:02,824
Why? Let's take a look.

627
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:07,561
Here's New York, 1970.
Burned 6 hours over 5 floors.

628
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:11,233
Los Angeles, 3,5 hours
over 5 floors.

629
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:16,047
Philadelphia, 18 hours over 8 floors.

630
00:47:16,047 --> 00:47:20,683
Caracas, Venezuela, burned
17 hours over 26 floors.

631
00:47:20,683 --> 00:47:24,418
Not one of these fires brought
these high rises down.

632
00:47:24,418 --> 00:47:29,898
In fact, no high rise steel framed building
has ever been brought down by any fire.

633
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:37,079
Yet relatively small, randomly placed fires
and a whole lot of smoke is to have brought

634
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:41,435
this skyscraper, Building 7,
down in 6,5 seconds

635
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:44,338
after burning in just that afternoon.

636
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:47,257
How about this FEMA report
and these investigations?

637
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:52,386
Well, we have 4 investigations,
starting in 2001 with the ASCE,

638
00:47:52,386 --> 00:47:54,249
the American Society of Civil Engineers.

639
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:58,602
We're told that these are volunteers but
these are not your average PTA volunteers.

640
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:04,138
These guys earn 10 million dollars annually
average between them working for

641
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:10,158
the Defense Department with their expertise,
mainly on blast resistance of buildings.

642
00:48:10,158 --> 00:48:15,131
Then we have the FEMA report in 2002
which finally got some funding,

643
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:16,723
600.000 dollars.

644
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:21,926
Compare that to the 40 million dollar
effort to find the source of those stains

645
00:48:21,926 --> 00:48:23,834
on Monica Lewinsky's dress.

646
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:28,706
This is easily the 3rd worst
structural failure in modern history.

647
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:32,768
It deserves a far greater
response and resources.

648
00:48:32,768 --> 00:48:38,086
In 2002 we had the Silverstein/Weidlinger
report, responsible for reversing

649
00:48:38,086 --> 00:48:43,571
the theory of FEMA, which came up
basically with the 'pancake theory'

650
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:48,748
or the 'zipper theory' where one truss
pulled away from the columns

651
00:48:48,748 --> 00:48:52,755
and then caused the others to pull away
and that chain reaction went around

652
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:56,021
and then the floors
'pancaked' all the way down.

653
00:48:56,021 --> 00:48:57,136
We'll talk about that.

654
00:48:57,136 --> 00:49:01,828
Silverstein/Weidlinger report was
responsible for changing that theory

655
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:07,469
because if that were true it would've
been the bolts that broke and therefore

656
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:12,274
Larry Silverstein, the overall owner of
this complex would not have been paid

657
00:49:12,274 --> 00:49:16,830
his 5,6 billion dollars that he's been
paid on the insurance settlement.

658
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,339
Why? Because that would've
been the building's fault

659
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:20,884
instead of the terrorists' fault.

660
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:22,210
So we had to have another theory.

661
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,872
And the new theory states that the
trusses sagged, pulled in the columns,

662
00:49:26,872 --> 00:49:30,690
they blame the persistence of that
connection, and then the columns buckled

663
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,700
and then the whole
thing came down.

664
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,212
Either way, it's something that we're
going to be looking at very critically here

665
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:39,550
in a moment.

666
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:46,363
Then we have the NIST investigation which
took over all of these investigations in 2005

667
00:49:46,363 --> 00:49:50,646
and came up with a 3 year,
20 million dollar effort.

668
00:49:50,646 --> 00:49:53,776
We'll take a close look
at NIST's work.

669
00:49:53,776 --> 00:49:59,993
These experts, who worked on these
buildings, all worked from the FEMA report,

670
00:49:59,993 --> 00:50:03,789
or most of them, into the Weidlinger
report and into the NIST report.

671
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:08,613
These are not independent investigations
by any means whatsoever.

672
00:50:08,613 --> 00:50:11,596
Let's listen to what FEMA did
conclude because it's interesting.

673
00:50:11,596 --> 00:50:16,003
"Evidence of a severe high temperature
corrosion attack on the steel, including rapid

674
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:21,810
oxidation and sulfidation with
subsequent intergranular melting."

675
00:50:22,178 --> 00:50:23,366
Very interesting.

676
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:28,031
Remember, office fires don't melt steel.
What melted the steel?

677
00:50:28,031 --> 00:50:31,938
Sulphur formed during this hot
corrosion attack on the steel.

678
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:36,633
Here is the intergranular
melting documented for all of us.

679
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:37,925
Thank you.

680
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:43,833
Capable of turning a solid steel girder
into Swiss cheese, like this former column,

681
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:49,788
wide flange column from the
structural steel in Building 7.

682
00:50:51,403 --> 00:50:57,958
Now they document this very carefully
in their appendix C. Listen to this.

683
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:02,911
"Gaping holes, some larger than a
silver dollar, let light shine through.

684
00:51:02,911 --> 00:51:08,531
A one inch column being reduced
to half inch thickness, its edges curled

685
00:51:08,531 --> 00:51:13,693
like a paper scroll, having been
thinned to almost razor sharpness."

686
00:51:13,693 --> 00:51:19,670
This was the flange, curled up on itself.
This is the web of that wide flange column.

687
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:25,447
NIST swept this entire appendix C
under the rug and we do not have it

688
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:28,202
in the official report today.

689
00:51:28,444 --> 00:51:29,860
Listen to this though.

690
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,684
"The collapse of WTC7 had a small debris
field as the façade was pulled downward,

691
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:38,755
suggesting internal
failure and implosion.

692
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:45,155
The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how
they caused the building to collapse remain

693
00:51:45,155 --> 00:51:47,356
unknown at this time "

694
00:51:47,356 --> 00:51:49,367
What? Unknown?

695
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:53,787
"the best hypothesis (fire + random
damage-then complete collapse)

696
00:51:53,787 --> 00:51:57,283
has only a low
probability of occurrence"

697
00:51:57,283 --> 00:52:04,054
Wait a minute You spent 600.000
dollars of our tax payer money and

698
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:08,871
over a year investigating this and
your best hypothesis isn't even right?

699
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:12,534
What do you do when your hypothesis
is not corroborated by the facts?

700
00:52:12,534 --> 00:52:18,562
You go back and construct a new
hypothesis. In FEMA's case, punt.

701
00:52:18,562 --> 00:52:19,977
And that's what they did.

702
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:23,324
They say "further research,
investigation and analysis are needed

703
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:24,757
to resolve this issue."

704
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:29,495
But unfortunately, for those hoping to
resolve the issue, much of that evidence

705
00:52:29,495 --> 00:52:33,200
had already been destroyed.
About 99% in fact.

706
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,484
By FEMA!

707
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:37,862
Before the report came
out in May of 2002.

708
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:42,133
Let's listen to what real investigation
should've been performed.

709
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:48,997
Normally, when you have a structural failure,
you carefully go through the debris field,

710
00:52:48,997 --> 00:52:56,453
looking at each item, photographing every
beam as it collapsed and every column,

711
00:52:56,453 --> 00:52:58,992
where it is in the ground,
and you pick them up very carefully

712
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:02,068
and you look at each element.

713
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:05,088
We were unable to do that
in the case of Tower 7.

714
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:10,171
Why? Because all the steel was
removed before the report came out.

715
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,542
In fact, 800 truck loads a day.

716
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:18,271
Easily the 3 worst structural
failures in modern history.

717
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:20,747
250 Pieces were saved

718
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:24,740
"Crucial evidence that can answer the
questions is on a slow boat to China",

719
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:31,820
exclaims Bill Manning, editor in chief of the
125 year old Fire Engineering Magazine that

720
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:36,067
brings together fire protection
engineers to communicate with each other.

721
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:39,691
"Showing an astounding ignorance of
the government officials to the value of a

722
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:42,002
thorough scientific investigation.

723
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:45,755
The removal and destruction of
evidence must stop immediately."

724
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:50,512
"Commission a fully resourced
blue ribbon panel to conduct

725
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:54,270
a clean and thorough investigation"
is what they were calling for.

726
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:58,841
If the evidence contradicts
your fire hypothesis, destroy it.

727
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:01,392
That's where our tax dollars are going.

728
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:03,984
How about the 9/11 Commission
which was tasked with giving us

729
00:54:03,984 --> 00:54:05,384
the fullest explanation?

730
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:11,828
No. Not one sentence in the 571 pages
of the 9/11 Commission report even

731
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:15,062
mentions the destruction of WTC 7.

732
00:54:15,062 --> 00:54:18,323
Is this one of the reasons perhaps
that senator Max Cleland

733
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:20,030
resigns from the Commission citing:

734
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:24,138
"It's a national scandal.
The investigation is compromised."

735
00:54:24,138 --> 00:54:27,218
How about expert corroboration?

736
00:54:27,218 --> 00:54:30,829
How about Danny Jowenko,
27 year controlled demolition expert?

737
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:34,142
"It starts from below, they've
simply blown away the columns.

738
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:38,711
It's controlled demolition.
A team of experts did this.

739
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:41,516
It's professional work,
without a doubt."

740
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:45,404
How about Hugo Bachman, professor
emeritus, chairman of the Department of

741
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:48,269
Structural Dynamics and
Earthquake Engineering Swiss

742
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:51,400
Federal Institute of Technology?

743
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,095
In my opinion the building, WTC7,
was, with great probability,

744
00:54:55,095 --> 00:54:57,529
professionally demolished."

745
00:54:57,934 --> 00:55:01,313
How about Kamal Obeid with Architects
and Engineers for 9/11 Truth,

746
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:02,567
a structural engineer?

747
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:08,645
"A localized failure in a steel framed
building like WTC7 cannot cause

748
00:55:08,645 --> 00:55:14,257
a catastrophic collapse like a house
of cards without a simultaneous

749
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:18,315
and patterned loss of several of
its column sat key locations

750
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,742
within the building."

751
00:55:19,742 --> 00:55:22,608
Does that sound like fire?
No.

752
00:55:22,608 --> 00:55:26,728
How about this fire and protection
engineer once again, Jonathan Barnett?

753
00:55:26,728 --> 00:55:30,121
We were surprised that
tower 7 collapsed.

754
00:55:30,121 --> 00:55:35,156
We being the team that investigated
what occurred on that day.

755
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:39,350
Building 7. Do we have any
foreknowledge of its destruction?

756
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:43,955
"We're moving the command post over
this way, that building is coming down"

757
00:55:43,955 --> 00:55:46,156
says Chief Nick Visconti.

758
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:48,518
Well, there was some
structural damage, as we've noted

759
00:55:48,518 --> 00:55:50,890
and they were concerned about it.

760
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:55,858
"By noon or one o' clock, they told
us to move from the triage site,

761
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:00,419
up to Pace University a little further
away because Building 7 was going to

762
00:56:00,419 --> 00:56:04,833
come down, or being brought down"
says Indira Singh, interviewed

763
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,289
by Bonnie Faulkner on KPFA.

764
00:56:08,426 --> 00:56:10,294
"Did they actually use the
words 'brought down'?"

765
00:56:10,294 --> 00:56:13,152
"Yeah, that's what they said, we're
going to have to bring it down."

766
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:19,024
This involves volition. Listen to these
construction workers walking away

767
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:23,181
from Building 7 and this
police officer caught on CNN.

768
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:31,211
Keep your eye on that
building, it's coming down.

769
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:34,170
The building is about to blow up.
Move it back.

770
00:56:37,278 --> 00:56:46,138
We are walking back as the building is about
to blow up. Flames and debris coming down.

771
00:56:46,138 --> 00:56:48,503
Keep your eye on that building,
it's about to come down.

772
00:56:48,503 --> 00:56:53,092
The building is about to blow up.
Flame and debris coming down?

773
00:56:53,092 --> 00:56:58,226
How do they know? And how about
Kevin McPadden, what did he say?

774
00:56:58,226 --> 00:57:03,645
And at the last few seconds he took
his hand off and you heard 3, 2, 1

775
00:57:03,645 --> 00:57:06,029
Countdown? Does that
imply foreknowledge?

776
00:57:06,029 --> 00:57:09,807
Do fires bring buildings
down to countdown?

777
00:57:10,755 --> 00:57:11,928
Unlikely.

778
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:16,647
In fact, the BBC announces the collapse
20 minutes before it happened.

779
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:19,879
It's true. Jane Standley is here
announcing it. She says:

780
00:57:19,879 --> 00:57:25,773
"The 47 storey Salomon Brothers Building
close to the WTC has also collapsed,"

781
00:57:25,773 --> 00:57:28,457
and there it is standing behind her.

782
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:33,898
The BBC apologizes for this grievous error,
citing the confusing events of the day.

783
00:57:33,898 --> 00:57:38,965
But does that make them psychic?
Unlikely.

784
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:43,550
Is there some kind of script that's
handed out like the guy on the street

785
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:47,210
at the Twin Towers who had all the answers?

786
00:57:48,109 --> 00:57:53,348
I believe we've shown that Building 7
matches all of the features of

787
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:57,169
controlled demolition in the classic sense.

788
00:57:57,268 --> 00:58:01,370
Is it likely that Al Qaeda could
have had access to this building

789
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:05,584
which had to have been one of the
most secure outside the Pentagon?

790
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:13,265
We have to ask ourselves that question
a few times because, if they didn't,

791
00:58:13,265 --> 00:58:16,471
then who did?

792
00:58:17,256 --> 00:58:22,206
This is as far as we go.
You need to go farther.

793
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:26,060
And there are resources at
your disposal to do just that.

794
00:58:26,481 --> 00:58:32,057
I will point them out after we
look at the WTC Twin Towers.

795
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:38,233
Because as clear as the evidence is for
the destruction of Building 7 by explosives,

796
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:42,672
the evidence is even more clear
in the case of the Twin Towers.

797
00:58:42,672 --> 00:58:49,003
When you look at it with a new pair
of glasses and look at the forensic

798
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:51,609
science based evidence.

799
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:53,749
Let's get introduced here.

800
00:58:53,749 --> 00:58:57,339
Some call it the 'crowning achievement
of the International Style',

801
00:58:57,339 --> 00:58:58,824
this  pair of buildings.

802
00:58:58,824 --> 00:59:03,152
Others ' heartless modernism'.
In fact, architect Robert Stern calls it

803
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:04,999
'gigantic dumbness'.

804
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:08,321
It's 2 squares extruded, just to
the point where they become

805
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:10,184
the highest buildings in the world.

806
00:59:10,935 --> 00:59:15,666
Well, either way, no matter how you feel
about these buildings, they did have an

807
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:21,755
innovative structural engineering, led by
John Skilling and his aide, Leslie Robertson,

808
00:59:21,755 --> 00:59:28,431
who helped Minoru Yamasaki preserve
the simple sculptural purity of his forms.

809
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:33,867
And you can compare this building
to the elegant Art Deco

810
00:59:33,867 --> 00:59:38,975
of the Empire State Building and come
to your own conclusion about design.

811
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:45,929
But it did eclipse the highest building in the
world in 1976, just for a couple of years

812
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:48,369
until the Sears Tower outgrew it.

813
00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:56,616
The structural engineering innovations were
quite extraordinary, lending the award,

814
00:59:56,616 --> 00:59:59,488
the engineering project that
"demonstrates the greatest

815
00:59:59,488 --> 01:00:01,754
engineering skills and represents
the greatest contribution

816
01:00:01,754 --> 01:00:06,392
to engineering progress in mankind" by
the American Society of Civil Engineers.

817
01:00:06,392 --> 01:00:10,447
Let's take a look at what we achieved.
We have 60 foot spans.

818
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:15,468
We have a perimeter structure that's like
a tube structure and this inner core.

819
01:00:15,468 --> 01:00:17,092
Let's take a look at it.

820
01:00:17,268 --> 01:00:21,996
Most high rises up to this time  were built
on a dense grid of steel or concrete frames

821
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:25,652
all the way throughout the building
in a 20 or 30 foot grid.

822
01:00:25,652 --> 01:00:29,122
The Twin Towers were built as a
tube structure with a very dense,

823
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:34,251
strong mash of steel surrounding the
exterior and acting as a baring wall

824
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:40,387
which resists the lateral loads, earthquake
and, in this case, particularly, wind,

825
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:44,488
hurricanes of up to 140 miles
an hour it was designed to resist.

826
01:00:44,488 --> 01:00:50,507
This perimeter structure was 14 inch
columns, 3 foot 9 inches on center.

827
01:00:50,508 --> 01:00:55,205
Inside was this core, a dense
grid of 47 immense box columns,

828
01:00:55,205 --> 01:00:58,458
4 inch thick at the base,
2 inch thick at mid height.

829
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:03,655
Prefabricated floor assemblings, 22 gauge
steel decking, over which was poured

830
01:01:03,655 --> 01:01:09,512
reinforced concrete and held up by
29 inch deep open web steel trusses.

831
01:01:09,512 --> 01:01:18,047
All of this, by the way, was completely
pulverized, this floor structure, on 9/11.

832
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:19,263
We'll take a look at that.

833
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:24,823
Now these trusses were bolted to the
perimeter columns and the core columns

834
01:01:24,823 --> 01:01:28,517
with these 5/8th inch bolts which we
talked about the different theories about

835
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:30,346
what happened to those bolts.

836
01:01:30,346 --> 01:01:37,334
Now, this is a structure within a structure.
This dense core structure would have

837
01:01:37,334 --> 01:01:42,303
remained standing 1300 feet
in the air if this surrounding,

838
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:47,220
less strong floor structure
were to have collapsed around it.

839
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:53,222
In fact, the perimeter structure would
have been left standing for a while until

840
01:01:53,222 --> 01:01:55,389
its lack of support gave in.

841
01:01:55,389 --> 01:02:01,562
This is the core columns, 52 inches
by 22 inches along the long edge,

842
01:02:01,562 --> 01:02:05,763
almost solid steel at the bottom,
continuously welded from the bottom

843
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,325
all the way to the top.

844
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:14,675
Now, any 1800 degree fire would
have almost immediately conducted

845
01:02:14,675 --> 01:02:18,155
throughout this 100.000 ton heat sink.

846
01:02:20,141 --> 01:02:25,594
That's the reason there's been no
collapse of steel frame high rise fires.

847
01:02:25,594 --> 01:02:26,839
Because it's steel.

848
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:30,622
Hold a spoon over the stove,
see how long you can hold on to it.

849
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,879
Almost instantly you'll
be forced to let it go.

850
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:41,031
Let's take a look at the structural imperative
that was given to John Skilling.

851
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:46,558
John Skilling and Les Robertson were
the structural engineers who designed

852
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:51,317
the streamlined steel frames
of the Twin Towers in the 1960'.

853
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:57,312
Because a wayward army bomber flew
into the Empire State Building in 1945,

854
01:02:57,312 --> 01:03:01,901
the Towers were built with
skyscraper crashes in mind.

855
01:03:02,494 --> 01:03:10,510
We had designed the project for the
impact of the largest airplane of its time,

856
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:12,390
the Boeing 707.

857
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:17,094
That is, to take this jet airplane,
run it into the building,

858
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:21,020
destroy a lot of structure
and still have it stand up.

859
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:27,103
The building was designed to have
a fully loaded 707 crash into it,

860
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,602
that was the largest plane at the time.

861
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:38,445
I believe that the building could probably
sustain multiple impacts of jetliners because

862
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:48,316
this structure is like the mosquito netting
in your screen door, this intense grid,

863
01:03:48,316 --> 01:03:53,283
and the jet plane is just a pencil
puncturing that screen netting.

864
01:03:53,283 --> 01:03:56,340
It really does nothing to the screen netting.

865
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:59,642
A very robust structure in fact.

866
01:03:59,642 --> 01:04:04,557
The forces coming down routed themselves
around, they arched around the opening

867
01:04:04,557 --> 01:04:06,472
created by the airplane.

868
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:11,533
In fact, Eager says: "The towers
withstood the initial impact of the aircraft,

869
01:04:11,533 --> 01:04:18,252
this ability to withstand the initial impact is
hardly surprising" given the robust nature.

870
01:04:18,252 --> 01:04:25,330
We have the North Tower being hit at 8.46 in
the morning and about 102 minutes later,

871
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:32,067
after fires travelled around the floors and
up the floors, in the case of the North Tower,

872
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:34,807
the building did collapse.

873
01:04:34,807 --> 01:04:40,889
The South Tower was hit about 15 minutes
later and after only about 56 minutes

874
01:04:40,889 --> 01:04:47,991
it collapses as the fires were
in fact diminishing severely.

875
01:04:48,026 --> 01:04:54,342
Skilling noted that he designed the towers
to take a hit from a Boeing 707 traveling

876
01:04:54,342 --> 01:04:56,521
600 miles an hour.

877
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:59,921
When he was asked if he
considered  plane crashes he cites;

878
01:04:59,921 --> 01:05:03,009
"Our analysis indicated that the
biggest problem would be the fact

879
01:05:03,009 --> 01:05:05,925
that all the fuel would
dump into the building.

880
01:05:05,925 --> 01:05:09,342
But the building structure
would still be there."

881
01:05:09,342 --> 01:05:14,268
This is FEMA's theory.
We have the sagging of the trusses

882
01:05:14,268 --> 01:05:19,664
and the pulling away from the column and
then the subsequent pancaking down.

883
01:05:20,006 --> 01:05:26,543
Again the trusses, one after the other, 6 foot
8 inches, every truss disengaging from the

884
01:05:26,543 --> 01:05:31,576
perimeter wall, which would have to be,
at the rate that these buildings fell,

885
01:05:31,576 --> 01:05:35,495
that would have been at the speed of
sound, the disengagement from one truss

886
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:38,995
to the next, all the way around
the building, and then the next floor

887
01:05:38,995 --> 01:05:40,482
and the next floor and the next floor.

888
01:05:42,202 --> 01:05:45,586
So, NIST turns it around and blames
the persistence of these connections

889
01:05:45,586 --> 01:05:49,613
pulling in the columns,
causing the columns to buckle.

890
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:55,160
It's generally more difficult for people
to understand that the Towers were

891
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:00,237
a controlled demolition because it was
so outside our frame of reference,

892
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:02,854
we'd never seen anything like this.

893
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:07,540
So this, combined with the shock,
kept us from being objective.

894
01:06:08,236 --> 01:06:13,068
But if you were to plan a fire induced
collapse as a result of airplanes

895
01:06:13,068 --> 01:06:17,202
you'd start the explosions at
the point of jet plane impact.

896
01:06:17,202 --> 01:06:23,831
So in WTC 2 and 1 we have all of
the key characteristic features

897
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:26,857
of controlled demolition but with
some of these key differences.

898
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:31,950
We have the beginning of detonation
at the point of jet plane impact,

899
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,074
not at the base of the building.

900
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:39,984
In addition we have not an implosion
but where everything is being exploded

901
01:06:39,984 --> 01:06:42,158
outside the footprint.

902
01:06:42,287 --> 01:06:47,414
We have squibs or these mistimed
explosions that occur 20, 40

903
01:06:47,414 --> 01:06:49,725
and even 60 stories down below.

904
01:06:49,725 --> 01:06:56,652
And, as we've already discussed, the
evidence for thermite in the molten metal

905
01:06:56,652 --> 01:06:59,813
and in the dust,
in the iron rich microspheres.

906
01:06:59,813 --> 01:07:02,776
So let's take a look, starting
with the sudden onset.

907
01:07:02,776 --> 01:07:06,236
What is the evidence for
this and how is it produced?

908
01:07:06,236 --> 01:07:10,629
It's produced by these sounds
and flashes from the explosions.

909
01:07:10,629 --> 01:07:16,047
Now, the city's Fire Commissioner, Thomas
von Essen, requires all of his EMT's

910
01:07:16,047 --> 01:07:21,672
and fire fighters to record their
experiences, about 500 of them

911
01:07:21,672 --> 01:07:29,366
and in 12.000 pages as it turns out,
collected from 2001 to 2002.

912
01:07:29,366 --> 01:07:34,377
The New York State Court of Appeal
overturns the City's request to hold on

913
01:07:34,377 --> 01:07:38,273
to this information against the
law suit by the New York Times.

914
01:07:38,273 --> 01:07:42,751
They failed and why was the City
holding on to this information?

915
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:49,474
Was it because 118 of these fire fighters
witnessed sounds and flashes

916
01:07:49,474 --> 01:07:51,068
of explosions?

917
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:54,732
"We felt the ground shake. You could
see the towers sway and then

918
01:07:54,732 --> 01:07:55,578
it just came down."

919
01:07:55,578 --> 01:07:58,110
"All of a sudden the ground
just started shaking."

920
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,644
"It shook my bones."

921
01:07:59,644 --> 01:08:03,852
"Shortly before the first tower came down
I remember feeling the ground shaking."

922
01:08:03,852 --> 01:08:06,349
"Somewhere around the middle of the
World Trade Center there was this

923
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:09,773
orange and red flash coming out.
Initially it was just one flash.

924
01:08:09,773 --> 01:08:12,571
Then this flash just kept popping all the
way around the building and that building

925
01:08:12,571 --> 01:08:14,484
had started to explode."

926
01:08:15,457 --> 01:08:17,504
"like on television they
blow up these buildings.

927
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:22,313
It seemed like it was going all the way
around like a belt, all these explosions."

928
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:25,634
"Pop pop pop, that's when I
heard the building coming down."

929
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,844
"Saw a brief number of  light sources
being emitted from inside the building

930
01:08:28,844 --> 01:08:31,003
between floors 10 and 15."

931
01:08:31,003 --> 01:08:34,726
"I saw low level flashes."
"We actually heard the pops, you know,

932
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:35,990
you heard the pops of the building."

933
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,683
"It was blowing up on all 4 sides."

934
01:08:38,683 --> 01:08:42,231
"With each popping sound it was initially
an orange and then a red flash came

935
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:45,758
out of the building and then it would just
go all around the building on both sides."

936
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:51,292
"I saw flash flash flash and then it
looked like the building came down."

937
01:08:51,292 --> 01:08:54,064
"I thought the terrorists planted
explosives somewhere in the building.

938
01:08:54,064 --> 01:08:57,665
That's how loud it was,
crackling explosive."

939
01:08:58,482 --> 01:09:01,747
Well, you can hear that
explosive in this video.

940
01:09:02,426 --> 01:09:05,824
Yeah. Here's one of the guys
to tell you I'm OK, alright? Hold on.

941
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,303
You wanna call your mother?

942
01:09:12,745 --> 01:09:17,206
Does that sound like a fire?
Or collapsing floors?

943
01:09:17,596 --> 01:09:21,217
None of these explosions are
a part of the official story.

944
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,768
"Another loud boom at the upper
floors and then there was a series

945
01:09:25,768 --> 01:09:28,256
of smaller explosion swhich appeared
to go  completely around the building

946
01:09:28,256 --> 01:09:29,673
at the upper floors."

947
01:09:29,849 --> 01:09:32,727
"Before it came down
I saw low level flashes."

948
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:37,296
"Flash flash flash and then it looked
like the building came down."

949
01:09:37,296 --> 01:09:40,141
"Did you see any flashes?
I said yeah, I thought it was just me.

950
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:42,236
He said no, I saw them too."

951
01:09:42,236 --> 01:09:44,162
What did these guys experience?

952
01:09:44,162 --> 01:09:47,981
You saw
Floor by floor it started popping out.

953
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:51,324
It was like they had detonators,
as if they were planted

954
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:53,486
to take down the building,
boom boom booom boom boom

955
01:09:53,486 --> 01:09:54,568
All the way down.

956
01:09:55,089 --> 01:09:57,747
How about the news reporters,
what did they say?

957
01:09:57,747 --> 01:10:02,284
They tend to tell the truth, as we
pointed out earlier, on the first day.

958
01:10:02,284 --> 01:10:05,084
And then we don't hear that truth again.
What happens to it?

959
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:10,024
Anybody who has ever watched a building
being demolished on purpose knows that

960
01:10:10,024 --> 01:10:15,135
if you're going to do this you have to get
at the under infrastructure of a building

961
01:10:15,135 --> 01:10:15,973
and bring it down.

962
01:10:15,973 --> 01:10:20,306
The entire building has just collapsed
as if a demolition team set off

963
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:23,034
When you see the old demolitions
of these old buildings,

964
01:10:23,034 --> 01:10:26,546
it folded in on itself and
it's not there anymore.

965
01:10:26,546 --> 01:10:30,586
At 10.30 I tried to leave the building
but as soon as I got outside I heard

966
01:10:30,586 --> 01:10:35,105
a second explosion and another rumble
and more smoke and more dust.

967
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:40,346
I ran inside the building, the chandeliers
shook and again black smoke filled the air.

968
01:10:40,346 --> 01:10:45,103
Within another 5 minutes we were covered
again with more silt and more dust.

969
01:10:45,103 --> 01:10:48,470
And then a fire marshal came in
and said we had to leave because,

970
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:52,539
if there were a 3rd explosion
this building might not last.

971
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:56,305
A huge explosion now,
raining debris on all of us,

972
01:10:56,555 --> 01:10:58,065
we gotta get out of the way!

973
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:01,647
And all of a sudden there was this
big explosion. I don't know if

974
01:11:01,647 --> 01:11:03,799
Just like you've just seen.
That's what we went through

975
01:11:03,799 --> 01:11:05,164
before we came out of the building.

976
01:11:05,164 --> 01:11:08,915
There was another big,
big explosion in the other tower.

977
01:11:09,018 --> 01:11:14,611
Now watch this gentleman as he
experiences the North Tower collapsing

978
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:19,850
and ask yourself this question.
Is his reaction justified by witnessing

979
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:23,458
what we're told is a gravitational
collapse which happens to be about

980
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:26,329
1700 feet away from him?

981
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:29,958
People were just standing around
talking to each other, not even..

982
01:11:33,909 --> 01:11:35,243
Oh my God

983
01:11:35,243 --> 01:11:38,684
Do you know whether it was an
explosion or a building collapse?

984
01:11:38,963 --> 01:11:43,342
To me it sounded like eh,
to me it sounded like an explosion.

985
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:44,299
There was a huge explosion.

986
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:50,183
Chief Albert Tury told me he was here after
the events that took place this morning.

987
01:11:50,183 --> 01:11:53,843
He tried to get his men out as quickly
as he could but he said that there was

988
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,855
another explosion which took place.

989
01:11:55,855 --> 01:12:01,693
And then, an hour after there was
another explosion in one of the towers here.

990
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:06,346
According to his theory he thinks that there
were actually devices that were planted

991
01:12:06,346 --> 01:12:07,347
in the buildings.

992
01:12:07,347 --> 01:12:09,883
It just went like BABOOOM,
like a bomb went off.

993
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:12,655
It was like holy hell
coming down those stairs.

994
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:19,066
And then we finally got to the bottom, we
were coming out, and another explosion

995
01:12:19,066 --> 01:12:20,957
sent everyone flying.

996
01:12:21,193 --> 01:12:24,481
Like the sound of gun fire,
bang bang bang bang,

997
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:27,705
and then suddenly 3 big explosions.

998
01:12:27,705 --> 01:12:32,626
I was about 5 blocks away
when I heard explosions, 3 thuds,

999
01:12:32,626 --> 01:12:36,552
and I turned around to see the building
we  just got out of tip over and

1000
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,696
fold in on itself.

1001
01:12:38,742 --> 01:12:42,699
We heard reports of secondary explosions
after the airplanes impacted.

1002
01:12:42,699 --> 01:12:46,756
Whether, in fact, there was something else
at the base of the towers that in fact were

1003
01:12:46,756 --> 01:12:49,529
the coup de gras to
bring them to the ground.

1004
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:52,876
As we were getting our gear on
and making our way to the stairway

1005
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:55,512
there was a heavy duty explosion.

1006
01:12:55,512 --> 01:13:00,485
Again, none of these explosions
are a part of the official story.

1007
01:13:00,485 --> 01:13:08,416
Now, compare these explosions to
a known explosion on the left here.

1008
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:13,710
Upward, outward, arching streamers,
pyroclastic volumes of dust,

1009
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:16,871
symmetrical display like a mushroom.

1010
01:13:16,871 --> 01:13:21,905
Does it look like a
gravitational collapse to you?

1011
01:13:22,759 --> 01:13:28,147
How could explosives be placed at the
WTC Twin Towers with 50.000 occupants

1012
01:13:28,147 --> 01:13:30,635
not knowing about it?

1013
01:13:30,635 --> 01:13:35,889
Well, this is the floor plan.
Let's enlarge it and take a closer look.

1014
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:43,134
We note that the core structure, the columns
of which are immediately adjacent to almost

1015
01:13:43,134 --> 01:13:46,695
all of the elevators,
at the lower levels certainly.

1016
01:13:46,695 --> 01:13:52,575
If you had access to the elevator hoist way
and you could hack through the 2 layers

1017
01:13:52,575 --> 01:13:57,832
of ¾ inch gypsum board protecting the
building from a fire rising up through it,

1018
01:13:57,832 --> 01:14:03,881
you would have access to the core columns
and beams and no one would see you.

1019
01:14:04,865 --> 01:14:09,464
How about an elevator modernization which
we know was going on the nine months

1020
01:14:09,464 --> 01:14:11,446
prior to 9/11?

1021
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:15,673
Yes, Elevator World,
March 2001 documents it.

1022
01:14:15,673 --> 01:14:19,283
In fact, they were in the
middle of this modernization.

1023
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:21,419
ACE Elevator had the contract.

1024
01:14:21,419 --> 01:14:26,773
We're not conspiracy theorists but it's pretty
obvious that somebody needs to be asked

1025
01:14:26,773 --> 01:14:29,067
some very key questions.

1026
01:14:29,067 --> 01:14:33,178
There are people who noted that
the elevators were locked in turn

1027
01:14:33,178 --> 01:14:37,031
and that there were guards placed
at these locked elevators

1028
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:38,800
during the modernization.

1029
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:42,412
Of course you'd have
to have access to security.

1030
01:14:42,412 --> 01:14:45,725
Securicomm was brought in.
Who sits at the board of Securicomm?

1031
01:14:45,725 --> 01:14:48,445
Marvin Bush, the younger brother
of George Bush.

1032
01:14:48,445 --> 01:14:51,359
Let's have somebody ask
them some questions.

1033
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:55,707
Wireless detonation is common in the
industry, you don't need miles of wire

1034
01:14:55,707 --> 01:15:00,661
and you can detonate them
remotely with great flexibility, in fact.

1035
01:15:01,649 --> 01:15:03,213
Well, but is there a precedent?

1036
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:06,851
NIST tells us that it couldn't have
been a controlled demolition because it

1037
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:08,247
it didn't start at the bottom.

1038
01:15:08,247 --> 01:15:11,253
That's where most controlled
demolitions start with buildings.

1039
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:13,706
Let's take a look and see if
there's another way to do it.

1040
01:15:13,706 --> 01:15:16,313
The words of a senior blaster.

1041
01:15:16,314 --> 01:15:19,374
We blow the basement,
all the columns in the basement.

1042
01:15:19,374 --> 01:15:22,030
Then we crack it up at
the top to get it started.

1043
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:24,796
We go every other floor,
all the way down.

1044
01:15:24,796 --> 01:15:28,547
Every explosive has a timer on it,
that's why it's 'controlled'.

1045
01:15:28,547 --> 01:15:32,550
When the columns go, each floor goes
down and impacts the one below,

1046
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:33,871
and keeps going.

1047
01:15:33,977 --> 01:15:37,973
Mark Loizeaux is president of a
company called Controlled Demolition.

1048
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:40,661
You don't have to go to the top floor,
you can go almost anywhere

1049
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:43,765
in the structure and, given the right
circumstances you can release

1050
01:15:43,765 --> 01:15:47,261
all that stored energy, converting it
into what's called kinetic energy,

1051
01:15:47,261 --> 01:15:50,750
that's energy in motion, and that's
what brings the building down.

1052
01:15:51,717 --> 01:15:56,124
Well, here's a 3 storey, top down
controlled demolition, let's count them.

1053
01:15:56,408 --> 01:15:58,448
One , two three.

1054
01:15:59,063 --> 01:16:02,139
Now these are high energy
explosives, C4 and RDX.

1055
01:16:02,139 --> 01:16:06,667
Very loud booms and very visible flashes.

1056
01:16:07,373 --> 01:16:12,020
Perhaps the reason thermite was used
is because they don't have as loud

1057
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:16,394
of these explosions like
these high energy explosives.

1058
01:16:17,451 --> 01:16:20,377
And they don't have these
flashes that they do either.

1059
01:16:20,377 --> 01:16:24,779
Here's a 20 storey, middle
down controlled demolition.

1060
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:28,854
You can start demolitions
from anywhere you like.

1061
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:31,385
Let's look at the North Tower now.

1062
01:16:31,385 --> 01:16:35,163
What I want to point out to you is that
you're going to see some explosions

1063
01:16:35,163 --> 01:16:39,980
up at the top of the building, curiously
enough and what's going to happen is this

1064
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:46,260
entire section is going to telescope, such
that half of it, its upper half is destroyed

1065
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,213
before there is any movement
from the jet plane impact down.

1066
01:16:50,213 --> 01:16:54,348
Let's take a look.
Here's the first evidence of explosions,

1067
01:16:54,348 --> 01:17:00,275
and then over here,
and then the collapsing.

1068
01:17:01,853 --> 01:17:07,597
Of course, the violent clouds which are
emerging even prior to the collapse.

1069
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:11,137
We're going to take a closer
look after this second look.

1070
01:17:12,104 --> 01:17:16,403
A new fuel source which might
well be jet fuel that wasn't burned

1071
01:17:16,403 --> 01:17:18,289
that's getting new oxygen.

1072
01:17:18,322 --> 01:17:22,491
Let's take a look now closer up.

1073
01:17:23,942 --> 01:17:27,076
Right away we're seeing
clouds forming up here.

1074
01:17:27,115 --> 01:17:30,631
Wait, the collapse is
supposed to be down here.

1075
01:17:30,796 --> 01:17:33,795
We have asymmetrical
damage to this building, right?

1076
01:17:34,013 --> 01:17:39,373
The plane went in one side, and yet
this completely symmetrical collapse,

1077
01:17:39,373 --> 01:17:43,670
we'll use quotes from now
on and let's keep going.

1078
01:17:48,562 --> 01:17:49,754
And one more time.

1079
01:17:52,355 --> 01:17:55,931
Belts, just like the firemen saw,
all the way around the building.

1080
01:17:58,417 --> 01:18:04,364
The antenna falls about 12 meters first,
before anything else falls,

1081
01:18:04,364 --> 01:18:09,119
indicating core column damage
first, not trusses pulling away

1082
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,083
from the perimeter columns.

1083
01:18:11,252 --> 01:18:17,085
Now take a look at this, from the
same tower, from the bottom,

1084
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:23,380
noting the violence underneath
the mushroom cloud.

1085
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:27,550
The collapse is supposed to be
occurring way up here, but down below,

1086
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:35,304
as you'll see in this second run,
incredible quantities of squibs,

1087
01:18:35,304 --> 01:18:40,225
explosions bursting out, and on the 3rd
time I'd like to direct your attention

1088
01:18:40,225 --> 01:18:45,031
to this racing series of explosions
down the right side

1089
01:18:45,031 --> 01:18:47,558
and the corner of this building.

1090
01:18:49,082 --> 01:18:53,212
About 40 stories below
the collapsing building.

1091
01:18:53,212 --> 01:18:57,028
It gets painfully obvious
after a while, doesn't it?

1092
01:19:06,855 --> 01:19:11,028
Note these multiple nodes of
these independent explosions,

1093
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:13,794
it's a little different then the North Tower.

1094
01:19:14,845 --> 01:19:22,240
But it's still incredibly the same after a while,
after all of these explosions developed.

1095
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:26,588
Do we have a straight down,
symmetrical progression of collapse

1096
01:19:26,588 --> 01:19:28,342
outside the footprint?

1097
01:19:28,342 --> 01:19:33,853
We had a 207 foot wide building. FEMA
tells us, and you can see in this document,

1098
01:19:33,853 --> 01:19:41,241
that we have a 1200 foot debris field,
equidistant around each tower.

1099
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:46,805
Asymmetrical damage, symmetrical
distribution, all through the site in fact,

1100
01:19:46,805 --> 01:19:48,333
and beyond.

1101
01:19:51,029 --> 01:19:55,335
Do we have squibs or
these mistimed explosions?

1102
01:19:55,335 --> 01:20:00,088
Some believe that these might be
appropriately timed explosions, whatever

1103
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:04,223
In all the videos of the collapses explosions
can be seen bursting from the building

1104
01:20:04,223 --> 01:20:07,158
20 to 30 stories below
the demolition wave.

1105
01:20:07,874 --> 01:20:08,991
Here.

1106
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:16,761
Here.

1107
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:27,681
Here.

1108
01:20:35,179 --> 01:20:36,531
Here.

1109
01:20:41,363 --> 01:20:42,770
Here.

1110
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,589
And here.

1111
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:58,921
Now, NIST tells us that these
are puffs of air being produced

1112
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:03,629
by the collapsing building pushing
air down the hoist way like a piston,

1113
01:21:03,629 --> 01:21:05,577
it's gotta come out somewhere, right?

1114
01:21:05,577 --> 01:21:10,457
Well, first of all these are not puffs of air,
they're pulverized building materials.

1115
01:21:10,457 --> 01:21:16,111
And they occur at a 160 to 200 feet,
some of them, per second.

1116
01:21:16,111 --> 01:21:19,538
These velocities are
propelled by explosives.

1117
01:21:19,538 --> 01:21:25,463
20, 40 and 60 stories below, how
can a piston be producing all of that?

1118
01:21:25,745 --> 01:21:30,391
And in fact there are these focalized
ejections that occur half way

1119
01:21:30,391 --> 01:21:32,323
between the corners of the building.

1120
01:21:32,323 --> 01:21:37,828
Also, say that this was the
open office space, 60 feet long,

1121
01:21:37,828 --> 01:21:41,686
the elevator hoist way is over here,
the piston is going to shove the air

1122
01:21:41,686 --> 01:21:48,099
into this room, it's going to fill the room
fairly uniformly with air pressure

1123
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:50,633
before it breaks any windows, right?

1124
01:21:50,633 --> 01:21:55,724
And then it might break several but
not these focalized, pin point accurate,

1125
01:21:55,724 --> 01:21:59,962
geometrically precise,
violent ejections.

1126
01:21:59,997 --> 01:22:04,079
No, it's extremely unlikely.
But let's look at a couple of them.

1127
01:22:04,659 --> 01:22:09,752
As the South Tower begins to explode we
track 2 squibs near the bottom of the frame.

1128
01:22:10,682 --> 01:22:14,467
They shoot out quickly at first, then slow
and merge with the rest of the rest

1129
01:22:14,467 --> 01:22:15,762
of the dust cloud.

1130
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:19,987
Using the first few data points
we see the first squib shoots out

1131
01:22:19,987 --> 01:22:25,134
at 44,98 meters per second
or about 100 miles per hour.

1132
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:31,217
Doing the same for the second squib we
get a speed of 56,3 meters per second

1133
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:34,625
which works out close to 126 mph.

1134
01:22:34,665 --> 01:22:42,142
126 mph of almost instant ejection velocity?
Does fire create that?

1135
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:47,886
Do we have a near free fall pace through
the path of greatest resistance?

1136
01:22:47,886 --> 01:22:49,366
Let's take a look.

1137
01:22:49,366 --> 01:22:53,414
Galileo's law of falling bodies calculates
the time in which an object will travel

1138
01:22:53,414 --> 01:22:55,775
a certain distance in complete free fall.

1139
01:22:55,932 --> 01:23:00,651
Distance, D, equals 16.08 times
time in seconds squared.

1140
01:23:00,651 --> 01:23:04,072
The South Tower was 1362 feet tall.

1141
01:23:04,205 --> 01:23:13,040
1362 equals 16.08 times 84,7
or 9,2 seconds.

1142
01:23:24,396 --> 01:23:27,473
The Twin Towers came down
at nearly free fall speed.

1143
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:29,693
What are we talking about here?

1144
01:23:29,693 --> 01:23:33,830
Let's just try to put this in perspective
with this storey problem.

1145
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:40,465
We have a 15 storey building which we
hold with this crane over 95 stories

1146
01:23:40,465 --> 01:23:42,215
with nothing but air.

1147
01:23:42,215 --> 01:23:44,321
No resistance, right?
Just air resistance.

1148
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:49,605
Next to it another 15 storey building held
over a 95 storey building with, say,

1149
01:23:49,605 --> 01:23:54,273
80.000 tons of structural steel in it.

1150
01:23:54,573 --> 01:23:58,329
Now we're going to pull the levers on
these cranes and drop them both at once.

1151
01:23:58,692 --> 01:24:02,232
I brought a 95 storey
building with me today

1152
01:24:02,556 --> 01:24:07,501
and we're going to just
test this theory of NIST.

1153
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:09,785
I've got 2 15 storey buildings.

1154
01:24:09,785 --> 01:24:14,223
We've got 80.000 tons of structural
steel in this one right here

1155
01:24:14,459 --> 01:24:16,993
and we've got air resistance here.

1156
01:24:17,028 --> 01:24:18,662
So let's try it, OK?

1157
01:24:18,662 --> 01:24:24,451
We'll put them both up here, we'll
even give a little impact load too, OK?

1158
01:24:24,451 --> 01:24:28,106
Ready? 3, 2, 1

1159
01:24:28,783 --> 01:24:34,474
Oh my God! The one without any
resistance under it hit the ground first.

1160
01:24:34,474 --> 01:24:37,374
At virtually free fall speed.

1161
01:24:39,235 --> 01:24:43,559
This doesn't take much, does it?
What happened over here?

1162
01:24:43,559 --> 01:24:52,400
The building above, it met resistance
through the energy of deformation

1163
01:24:52,569 --> 01:24:54,479
it came to a halt.

1164
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:59,799
In fact, you'll find on our website,
www.AE911Truth.org ,

1165
01:24:59,799 --> 01:25:05,362
that Ken Cutler and Gordon Ross produced
these papers and they show and calculate

1166
01:25:05,362 --> 01:25:09,947
that in fact the building's downward
momentum would have been almost

1167
01:25:09,947 --> 01:25:12,091
immediately arrested.

1168
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:17,087
Then where is the 15 storey building that
was driving this building down to the ground

1169
01:25:17,087 --> 01:25:18,184
at free fall speed?

1170
01:25:18,184 --> 01:25:24,285
In the first 2 seconds you saw it reduced
half of its mass, it was blown outside,

1171
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:28,819
it couldn't have been used to influence
the downward progression of the building.

1172
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:34,017
In the next 2 seconds, after 4 seconds
totally, it's destroyed itself.

1173
01:25:34,017 --> 01:25:39,788
There's nothing crushing the building.
It's tearing itself apart at free fall speed.

1174
01:25:42,128 --> 01:25:45,802
And it's dismembering the steel structure.

1175
01:25:45,802 --> 01:25:51,522
In fact, the leading edge of these mushroom
clouds are full of perimeter columns,

1176
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,946
aluminum cladding and other steel.

1177
01:25:53,946 --> 01:25:57,190
Let's take a look at the South Tower
in terms of dismemberment.

1178
01:25:57,190 --> 01:25:58,878
See what's going on here.

1179
01:25:58,878 --> 01:26:02,310
South Tower is on your left.
It was hit lower by the aircraft.

1180
01:26:02,641 --> 01:26:08,033
And, as you can see, its descent,
its rapid destruction starts there and

1181
01:26:08,033 --> 01:26:10,097
it begins to tilt to the left.

1182
01:26:10,097 --> 01:26:14,002
Now in fact, it disappears in this cloud.

1183
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:20,370
We would expect to see this building,
which is already tilted at 22 degrees and

1184
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:24,921
continuing its angular momentum,
off center of the building below it.

1185
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:30,463
How can it crush it symmetrically at
free fall speed if it's already off center?

1186
01:26:30,586 --> 01:26:36,350
We don't see it either mangled up in some
heap at the bottom down on the pavement.

1187
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:38,870
It's been completely dismembered.

1188
01:26:39,371 --> 01:26:43,975
Let's take a look from below though.
Because I'm not quite convinced.

1189
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:51,770
We have asymmetrical damage and yet
there's this symmetrical destruction

1190
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,669
occurring underneath the cloud, all the
way around the building like the firemen saw

1191
01:26:55,669 --> 01:27:01,111
even though this top mass
is already fallen over.

1192
01:27:01,298 --> 01:27:05,218
Free fall speed.
It doesn't make sense to me.

1193
01:27:05,365 --> 01:27:07,775
The steel framed structure
was completely dismembered.

1194
01:27:07,775 --> 01:27:09,812
There are no large chunks of building.

1195
01:27:09,812 --> 01:27:15,036
Only those shards that we saw
of the perimeter structure.

1196
01:27:16,347 --> 01:27:20,441
Does it look like a
gravitational collapse to you?

1197
01:27:26,171 --> 01:27:29,294
Do we have lateral ejection
of structural steel?

1198
01:27:29,294 --> 01:27:30,295
Let's take a look.

1199
01:27:30,322 --> 01:27:33,121
Now let's take a look at the
collapse of the Twin Towers.

1200
01:27:42,765 --> 01:27:49,496
We're seeing explosions rather than
implosions, a first in demolition history.

1201
01:27:53,044 --> 01:27:57,889
A sequenced rumble becomes a
roar as debris is thrown outward.

1202
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,912
The damage is not contained.

1203
01:28:01,105 --> 01:28:04,030
Windows are blown from
neighborhood buildings.

1204
01:28:05,402 --> 01:28:08,152
What kind of energy enabled this?

1205
01:28:08,152 --> 01:28:13,120
Would fire hurl metal and
concrete sideways into the air?

1206
01:28:13,786 --> 01:28:20,820
Here a chunk of steel was blown
400 feet wedging itself deep in WTC 3

1207
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,591
on Vesey Street.

1208
01:28:25,694 --> 01:28:29,934
A FEMA photographer taking pictures
of Ground Zero wondered why

1209
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:34,366
so many steel beams were
jutting from neighborhood buildings.

1210
01:28:34,846 --> 01:28:39,387
What shot pieces of the Towers
all the way across the street?

1211
01:28:40,922 --> 01:28:47,823
In fact, the portions of the tower that
had the greatest structural members,

1212
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:52,587
the sky lobbies and the mechanical
floors, had their perimeter units

1213
01:28:52,587 --> 01:28:57,483
thrown farther than the perimeter
wall units from the upper floors,

1214
01:28:57,483 --> 01:29:02,255
because they're higher they
should have gone further, right?

1215
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:08,573
No, these perimeter units landed
on the Winter Garden, 600 feet away.

1216
01:29:09,173 --> 01:29:11,417
Let's take a look at the physics of this.

1217
01:29:11,823 --> 01:29:16,988
Girders weighing several tons were found
600 feet from the base of the North tower.

1218
01:29:17,317 --> 01:29:20,838
How fast they were ejected
depends on where they originated.

1219
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:26,426
If they came from high in the building they
were thrown outward at about 50 mph.

1220
01:29:26,581 --> 01:29:30,565
If they came from lower down
the speed had to be even greater.

1221
01:29:30,873 --> 01:29:35,550
Gravity alone cannot account for
such high lateral ejection speeds.

1222
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:40,022
In fact, let's take a look at a
couple of these specific ejections.

1223
01:29:40,126 --> 01:29:45,233
Using special software we can analyze
motion on video clips frame by frame.

1224
01:29:45,524 --> 01:29:50,350
I've placed markers on each frame
so we can track a particular projectile.

1225
01:29:50,894 --> 01:29:54,867
From the markers we can get a
data table and plot various graphs.

1226
01:29:55,472 --> 01:29:59,948
The data shows that the objects that we
were tracking were shot horizontally

1227
01:29:59,948 --> 01:30:02,148
at over 70 mph.

1228
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:06,623
The energy needed to hurl a 4 ton
girder at this speed is comparable

1229
01:30:06,623 --> 01:30:11,639
to the energy needed to hurl
a 200 pound cannonball 3 miles.

1230
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:14,285
What about those floors,
those pancakes?

1231
01:30:14,285 --> 01:30:18,271
If this is a pancake collapse we're
looking for pancakes down below.

1232
01:30:18,271 --> 01:30:23,002
This is a 7 storey lobby.
There's about 2 or 3 stories of stuff in there.

1233
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:28,085
We'll take a look at that stuff but
what I'm looking for is 110 floors

1234
01:30:28,085 --> 01:30:33,593
with this kind of metal decking underneath
4 and 5 inches thick of concrete.

1235
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:38,101
An acre in size, each of them.
110 acres of these.

1236
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:40,826
How many floors do we
find at the bottom?

1237
01:30:40,883 --> 01:30:45,645
Not 50, not 10, not even 1.

1238
01:30:45,645 --> 01:30:48,242
We don't even find metal
decking down there.

1239
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:52,332
Or concrete. There's hardly any
macroscopic chunks of concrete.

1240
01:30:52,516 --> 01:30:56,378
What happened to the metal decking?
What happened to the concrete?

1241
01:30:56,378 --> 01:30:59,231
Tom Patrezza  brought
these floor decks out.

1242
01:30:59,231 --> 01:31:03,979
"6000 of them", he says. "I couldn't
believe it. Not one floor panel",

1243
01:31:03,979 --> 01:31:07,025
he notes when he comes
back to help the clean up.

1244
01:31:07,025 --> 01:31:10,429
Pancakes occur in pancake collapses.

1245
01:31:10,664 --> 01:31:14,165
Enormous pyroclastic clouds
of pulverized concrete?

1246
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:17,096
Where is all the concrete in fact?

1247
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:20,056
Let's listen to Jeff King.

1248
01:31:20,056 --> 01:31:25,142
One of the most significant things to my
thinking that indicates that this could

1249
01:31:25,142 --> 01:31:29,334
not have been the sort of collapse
that we're told it was is the presence

1250
01:31:29,334 --> 01:31:30,639
of the dust clouds.

1251
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:37,278
And as you've seen in the pictures, I'm sure
all of us have seen more than we would like,

1252
01:31:37,278 --> 01:31:43,126
there were very very large clouds of
very thick dust that enveloped the area,

1253
01:31:43,126 --> 01:31:46,878
that crossed the river, that made
it almost all the way to New Jersey

1254
01:31:46,878 --> 01:31:48,806
from the pictures that I've seen.

1255
01:31:48,806 --> 01:31:53,680
This type of flow is something
that we're familiar with in physics.

1256
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:57,380
It occurs in only 2 situations
that we know of naturally.

1257
01:31:57,380 --> 01:32:03,253
One is in volcanic eruptions where a large
amount of material is suddenly exploded

1258
01:32:03,253 --> 01:32:07,293
into the air and basically
forms small particles.

1259
01:32:07,293 --> 01:32:09,903
Thank you, Jeff.
How about New York governor Petaki?

1260
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:14,216
And you look and you see
that there's no concrete.

1261
01:32:14,216 --> 01:32:17,667
There's very little concrete.
All you see is aluminum and steel.

1262
01:32:17,667 --> 01:32:19,231
What happened to the concrete?

1263
01:32:19,231 --> 01:32:20,506
The concrete was pulverized.

1264
01:32:20,506 --> 01:32:24,794
When I was down here Tuesday it was
like you were on a foreign planet.

1265
01:32:24,794 --> 01:32:27,375
All of Lower Manhattan, not just this site.

1266
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:31,519
From river to river there was
dust powder 2 to 3 inches thick.

1267
01:32:31,519 --> 01:32:34,972
The concrete was just pulverized.

1268
01:32:35,615 --> 01:32:37,125
And how about this fire fighter?

1269
01:32:38,836 --> 01:32:43,504
You have two 110 storey office buildings.

1270
01:32:43,504 --> 01:32:47,964
You don't find a desk,
you don't find a chair.

1271
01:32:47,964 --> 01:32:50,764
You don't find a telephone,
a computer.

1272
01:32:50,764 --> 01:32:55,233
The biggest piece of a telephone
that I found was half of the keypad

1273
01:32:55,233 --> 01:32:57,310
and it was about this big.

1274
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:01,730
The building collapsed to dust.

1275
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:06,626
And this dust made it almost across
to New Jersey, across the river.

1276
01:33:06,626 --> 01:33:12,428
Thick, billowing, laying a carpet of 4 to 6
inches thick around Lower Manhattan.

1277
01:33:12,428 --> 01:33:19,280
Pulverized to 100 micron to 10 mille
 particles, almost like talcum powder,

1278
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,870
 some of it. 
It's very very fine.

1279
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:27,717
Where is the grinder that produced this?
90.000 tons of it.

1280
01:33:27,717 --> 01:33:34,399
In these clouds that expanded 10 times
the volume of the buildings themselves

1281
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:36,199
in just 30 seconds.

1282
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:43,093
Now the available gravitational potential in
the whole building was about 110.000 KWH.

1283
01:33:43,093 --> 01:33:47,480
That's basically the weight of the building
times its height above the ground

1284
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,166
evened out.

1285
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:55,179
But the expansion of these clouds has
been calculated to require about 10 times

1286
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:59,184
that energy in heat which
produces that expansion.

1287
01:33:59,184 --> 01:34:01,479
So we have a problem here.

1288
01:34:01,479 --> 01:34:07,434
In fact, the gravitational potential of
the entire building needs to also produce

1289
01:34:07,434 --> 01:34:09,651
4 other heat sinks.

1290
01:34:09,651 --> 01:34:16,154
But first, we have a 15 storey building,
this part of the gravitational potential alone,

1291
01:34:16,154 --> 01:34:22,724
it's converted all of its gravitational
potential into kinetic energy.

1292
01:34:22,724 --> 01:34:24,520
They can't do anymore work.

1293
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,531
In other words, it can't fall at
free fall speed and then also crush

1294
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:31,643
80.000 tons of structural steel.

1295
01:34:31,888 --> 01:34:38,299
It can't fall at free fall speed and also
grind up 90.000 tons of concrete.

1296
01:34:38,299 --> 01:34:44,127
It can't fall at free fall speed and
create by friction or anything else

1297
01:34:44,127 --> 01:34:47,799
these several tons of molten metal
seen by the first responders.

1298
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:49,726
The energy doesn't add up.

1299
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:55,815
We're talking overall about 50 times the
gravitational potential energy of the building

1300
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:58,543
to produce all of these phenomena.

1301
01:34:58,564 --> 01:34:59,667
How about the victims?

1302
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:05,138
In April 2006 New Yorkers were
distressed to learn that bone fragments,

1303
01:35:05,138 --> 01:35:09,753
human remains from 9/11, had been
found on the roof of the nearby

1304
01:35:09,753 --> 01:35:11,214
Deutsche Bank Building.

1305
01:35:11,214 --> 01:35:15,264
And how in God's name did
those fragments get there?

1306
01:35:15,264 --> 01:35:19,141
And bone fragments less
than a centimeter long.

1307
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:21,934
How could they be so small?

1308
01:35:21,992 --> 01:35:27,590
700 bone fragments half an inch long found
on top of a skyscraper across the street?

1309
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:29,738
Think about that one.

1310
01:35:29,738 --> 01:35:35,000
There's 2.749 victims but only
300 whole bodies were found.

1311
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,579
20.000 pieces of bodies found, 6.000
small enough to fit into a test tube.

1312
01:35:41,579 --> 01:35:45,896
1.151 victims completely unaccounted
for, in other words,

1313
01:35:45,896 --> 01:35:50,759
no pieces large enough to get
any DNA from, vaporized.

1314
01:35:50,759 --> 01:35:54,348
200 pieces were matched
to one single person.

1315
01:35:54,687 --> 01:36:02,643
Can fire and gravitational collapse account
for this massive pulverization of people?

1316
01:36:02,898 --> 01:36:04,610
We talked about the iron microspheres.

1317
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:07,523
We talked about the chemical
evidence of thermate in them

1318
01:36:07,523 --> 01:36:09,672
and in the slag and
the ends of the beams.

1319
01:36:09,672 --> 01:36:16,323
And we talked about evidence of thermite
and unexploded thermite in the dust itself.

1320
01:36:16,323 --> 01:36:20,830
All of this is direct evidence
of explosive destruction.

1321
01:36:22,034 --> 01:36:26,543
And none of it can be
accounted for by fire.

1322
01:36:26,543 --> 01:36:29,289
Let's have dr. David Ray Griffin
sum this one up for us.

1323
01:36:29,289 --> 01:36:34,251
These facts taken together render the
likelihood of the official theory

1324
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,819
essentially zero.

1325
01:36:36,854 --> 01:36:42,820
In fact, each of the 10 phenomena,
the likelihood of them occurring

1326
01:36:42,820 --> 01:36:48,301
without explosives being used
is by itself essentially zero.

1327
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:53,004
But let's be generous and suggest
that maybe there's a 1% chance

1328
01:36:53,004 --> 01:36:54,991
that these things could occur.

1329
01:36:54,991 --> 01:37:01,420
Virtual free fall speed, straight down,
enormous amount of dust, 1% chance.

1330
01:37:01,828 --> 01:37:07,343
But when you figure up the probabilities
down when you say how many that

1331
01:37:07,343 --> 01:37:13,992
2 of them occur, 3 of them occur, by the
time you get up to 10 of them occurring

1332
01:37:13,992 --> 01:37:18,869
without explosives, you're talking
about the likelihood of on in a trillion.

1333
01:37:20,356 --> 01:37:27,322
So we can say that the official theory
about the Towers is disproved as thoroughly

1334
01:37:27,322 --> 01:37:33,080
as any such theory could possibly be
whereas all the evidence can be explained

1335
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:37,233
by the alternative theory according to
which the Towers were brought down

1336
01:37:37,233 --> 01:37:38,667
by explosives.

1337
01:37:38,927 --> 01:37:43,346
The official theory is therefore
an outrageous theory whereas

1338
01:37:43,346 --> 01:37:49,963
the alternative theory is, from a scientific
point of view, the only possible theory.

1339
01:37:50,516 --> 01:37:53,900
Thank you.
How about that FEMA report?

1340
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,827
What does Fire Engineering
Magazine say about it?

1341
01:37:58,251 --> 01:38:04,662
"FEMA investigation is a half
baked farce", Bill Manning says,

1342
01:38:04,662 --> 01:38:10,574
"that may already have been commandeered
by political forces whose primary interests,

1343
01:38:10,574 --> 01:38:15,096
to put it mildly, lie far afield
of full disclosure."

1344
01:38:15,096 --> 01:38:19,225
"The structural damage from the planes
and the explosive ignition of jet fuel

1345
01:38:19,225 --> 01:38:23,551
in themselves were not enough
to bring down the Towers."

1346
01:38:23,841 --> 01:38:28,557
How about that NIST report?
We got 20 million dollars and 3 years.

1347
01:38:28,557 --> 01:38:30,438
What happened with our tax dollars?

1348
01:38:30,438 --> 01:38:35,537
Their task was to determine how
and why WTC 1 and 2 collapsed

1349
01:38:35,537 --> 01:38:40,282
and how and why WTC 7 collapsed.
Let's look at their objective.

1350
01:38:40,282 --> 01:38:43,286
"The focus of the investigation was
on the sequence of the events,

1351
01:38:43,286 --> 01:38:49,230
from the instant of the aircraft  impact to
the initiation of collapse for each tower.

1352
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:52,473
For brevity in this report,
this sequence is referred to as

1353
01:38:52,473 --> 01:38:55,130
the 'probable collapse sequence'.

1354
01:38:55,130 --> 01:39:00,391
It doesn't actually include the structural
behavior of the tower after the conditions

1355
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:06,728
for collapse initiation were reached and
collapse became", they say, "inevitable."

1356
01:39:06,728 --> 01:39:10,273
Wait a minute. You're going to spend
3 years and 20 million dollars

1357
01:39:10,273 --> 01:39:15,210
and you're going to model every turbine
in the airplane and you're going to stop

1358
01:39:15,210 --> 01:39:20,839
the entire investigation before
the real action begins, right at the point

1359
01:39:20,839 --> 01:39:26,551
where the truss was sagging
and pulling in the first column

1360
01:39:26,551 --> 01:39:29,581
and you're just going
to stop your analysis?

1361
01:39:29,581 --> 01:39:32,877
How many engineers did you
have working on this?

1362
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:39,057
And what are you concluding?
They have 10.000 pages in this report.

1363
01:39:39,057 --> 01:39:44,425
This is the half page that explains
everything after that.

1364
01:39:44,425 --> 01:39:47,034
No analysis.
Let's see their conclusion.

1365
01:39:47,034 --> 01:39:50,948
"The structure below the level of collapse
initiation offered minimal resistance

1366
01:39:50,948 --> 01:39:54,137
to the falling building mass at
and above the impact zone."

1367
01:39:54,137 --> 01:39:59,071
Structural engineers do this every day.
This is not rocket science.

1368
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:02,419
You have the known weight
of this building mass.

1369
01:40:02,419 --> 01:40:07,004
You have what are known columns
below it in order to resist it.

1370
01:40:07,004 --> 01:40:14,687
You put the building up there and
you let it go in your models

1371
01:40:14,687 --> 01:40:19,161
and you calculate what the resistance is.
Why didn't they do it?

1372
01:40:19,161 --> 01:40:25,982
Could it be because they knew darn well
that it would not have collapsed at all?

1373
01:40:25,982 --> 01:40:28,360
What was the report title?

1374
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:32,682
'Final report on the collapse
of the WTC Twin Towers'.

1375
01:40:32,682 --> 01:40:38,459
They probably should have called it
'Final report on the initiation of collapse'.

1376
01:40:38,545 --> 01:40:40,941
They also cast doubt on their own theory.

1377
01:40:40,941 --> 01:40:46,454
They say to us in a letter to our request
for correction which several of us

1378
01:40:46,454 --> 01:40:50,703
 applied for and have yet 
to see adequate results from:

1379
01:40:50,703 --> 01:40:55,832
"We're unable to provide a full explanation
of the total collapse of the Twin Towers."

1380
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,352
Thank you.
We think so too.

1381
01:40:58,352 --> 01:41:02,720
Prompting Jim Hoffman to write
'Building a better mirage,

1382
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:07,934
NIST's 3-year, 20 million dollar cover up
of the crime of the century',

1383
01:41:07,934 --> 01:41:11,974
in which he documents numerous
unfounded assumptions.

1384
01:41:11,974 --> 01:41:14,850
He documents that it's
a mountain of distraction.

1385
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:17,888
They'll never read all this stuff.
TNRAT, they'll never read all this.

1386
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:23,202
10.000 pages.
1.000 pages modeling the airplanes.

1387
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:27,471
And, as I mentioned, only half a page
on their core presumption, classic,

1388
01:41:27,471 --> 01:41:29,302
progressive collapse.

1389
01:41:29,302 --> 01:41:33,188
How can it be classic if it never
happened before in history?

1390
01:41:33,188 --> 01:41:37,806
As if some initiating element in a steel
framed building caused the rest of it

1391
01:41:37,806 --> 01:41:39,614
to ever collapse.

1392
01:41:42,644 --> 01:41:47,878
He documents the startling omissions and
outrageous lies, which you'll have to go in to

1393
01:41:47,878 --> 01:41:52,713
yourself if you have a little more time,
and the fudged computer simulations.

1394
01:41:52,756 --> 01:41:59,828
They document these unrealistic scenarios
C and D, and the realistic scenarios A and B.

1395
01:41:59,828 --> 01:42:05,431
A and B didn't make the buildings collapse
so they crank up the airplane speed.

1396
01:42:05,431 --> 01:42:07,768
They reduced the strength of the structure.

1397
01:42:07,768 --> 01:42:09,192
They increase the fuel.

1398
01:42:09,192 --> 01:42:13,931
They do all of these adjustments until
they get, in the more unrealistic scenarios,

1399
01:42:13,931 --> 01:42:19,676
which they're actually fairly open about,
to get the computer model to collapse.

1400
01:42:20,065 --> 01:42:23,977
Structural engineers rail against NIST
 because they refuse to show 

1401
01:42:23,977 --> 01:42:25,436
the visualization.

1402
01:42:25,436 --> 01:42:28,995
It's a black box, you cannot
download any of this data.

1403
01:42:28,995 --> 01:42:34,656
This was a public building, or at least
before 3 months prior to 9/11

1404
01:42:34,656 --> 01:42:39,281
it was a public building, and it
should be a public investigation.

1405
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:46,122
Clearly it was a public event prompting their
former chief of their fire science division,

1406
01:42:47,214 --> 01:42:51,380
dr. Quintiere, to call for
an independent review.

1407
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:55,182
"Let's look at real alternatives that might
have been the cause of the collapse

1408
01:42:55,182 --> 01:42:57,705
of the WTC Twin Towers."

1409
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,660
Do we have any whistle blowers?

1410
01:42:59,974 --> 01:43:05,877
Yes. Kevin Ryan, fired from his job for
making public the fact that NIST hired

1411
01:43:05,877 --> 01:43:09,158
Underwriter Laboratories to perform tests.

1412
01:43:09,158 --> 01:43:13,580
And these tests showed that the building
should have remained standing.

1413
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:20,662
In fact, there were 4 mock samples of
35 foot spans, two 17 foot spans and

1414
01:43:20,662 --> 01:43:25,377
two 35 foot spans with fire proofing just like
in the Twin Towers with the floor decking.

1415
01:43:25,377 --> 01:43:31,930
Now, there's 2.000 degrees of fires put
underneath this assembly, per ASTME 119,

1416
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:36,257
and twice the amount of load that was
known to have been in the Twin Towers.

1417
01:43:36,257 --> 01:43:41,094
What happens?
None of them fail.

1418
01:43:41,094 --> 01:43:42,686
These are the 4 tests.

1419
01:43:42,686 --> 01:43:47,073
The steel temperatures were
over 1.100 degrees average.

1420
01:43:48,157 --> 01:43:52,269
Foot note nr. 3 documents
that no failure occurred.

1421
01:43:52,269 --> 01:43:54,887
In fact, there was only
3 inches of deformation.

1422
01:43:54,887 --> 01:43:58,096
What does NIST do with
this experimental data?

1423
01:43:58,096 --> 01:44:02,525
They throw it out and they claim
that there was a 42 inch sag,

1424
01:44:02,525 --> 01:44:06,408
10 times the value that resulted
from the experiments!

1425
01:44:06,543 --> 01:44:10,748
Do we have expert corroboration?
Well, here's Van Romero.

1426
01:44:10,748 --> 01:44:15,608
"It's too methodical to be a chance result
of airplanes colliding with the structure",

1427
01:44:15,608 --> 01:44:20,411
this explosives expert says.
"After the airplanes hit the WTC towers

1428
01:44:20,411 --> 01:44:23,940
there were some explosives, in my opinion,
inside the buildings that caused

1429
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:26,334
the towers to collapse."

1430
01:44:26,815 --> 01:44:31,107
Van has withdrawn these statements
after receiving a sizable grant

1431
01:44:31,107 --> 01:44:32,946
from the federal government.

1432
01:44:32,946 --> 01:44:35,111
Mike Taylor, a demolition expert:

1433
01:44:35,111 --> 01:44:38,344
"It looked like classic controlled demolition.
The collapse of the WTC towers

1434
01:44:38,344 --> 01:44:41,394
mirrored the strategy used
by demolition experts."

1435
01:44:41,704 --> 01:44:44,290
How about this structural engineer,
Ron Brookman?

1436
01:44:44,290 --> 01:44:47,878
"Explosive clouds of dust
and debris moving horizontally

1437
01:44:47,878 --> 01:44:52,560
and vertically upward as the collapses
of WTC 1 and WTC 2 are just beginning

1438
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,788
does not look anything like a heat-induced
gravitational collapse mechanism.

1439
01:44:57,788 --> 01:45:01,733
"Why complete collapse of the
Twin Towers became inevitable?

1440
01:45:01,733 --> 01:45:06,199
Why would all 110 stories drop straight
down to the ground in 10 seconds,

1441
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:08,215
pulverizing the contents?

1442
01:45:08,215 --> 01:45:12,705
None of the official reports address
the issue of total collapse.

1443
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:17,585
William Rice, structural engineer, also with
Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth:

1444
01:45:17,585 --> 01:45:20,812
"The prevailing theory would have us
believe that each of the Twin Towers

1445
01:45:20,812 --> 01:45:26,855
inexplicably collapsed upon itself crushing
all 287 massive columns on each floor

1446
01:45:26,855 --> 01:45:31,614
while maintaining a free fall speed
as if the 100.000 or more tons

1447
01:45:31,614 --> 01:45:36,753
of supporting structural steel
framework underneath didn't exist."

1448
01:45:36,753 --> 01:45:40,766
How about David Scott,
structural engineer with AE911Truth?

1449
01:45:40,766 --> 01:45:44,787
"Near free fall collapse
violates the laws of physics."

1450
01:45:44,787 --> 01:45:46,973
You can memorize that one.

1451
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:51,722
How about Scott Grainger, fire
protection engineer with AE911Truth?

1452
01:45:51,722 --> 01:45:54,551
"All three collapses were
very uniform in nature.

1453
01:45:54,551 --> 01:45:59,215
Natural collapses due to
unplanned events are not uniform."

1454
01:45:59,643 --> 01:46:03,814
How about Ed Munyak, with us today,
fire protection engineer?

1455
01:46:03,814 --> 01:46:08,251
"The fires were very weak, oxygen starved
as evidenced by the black smoke.

1456
01:46:08,251 --> 01:46:10,365
Steel temperatures were low.

1457
01:46:10,365 --> 01:46:17,055
All 3 WTC collapses have no resemblance
to any previous high rise fire."

1458
01:46:17,256 --> 01:46:20,274
How about Matthys Levy,
who later joined the FEMA team?

1459
01:46:20,274 --> 01:46:26,469
If you've seen many of the managed
demolitions where they implode a building

1460
01:46:26,469 --> 01:46:32,336
and they cause it actually to fall vertically
because they cause all the vertical columns

1461
01:46:32,336 --> 01:46:37,183
to fail simultaneously, that's exactly what
it looked like and that's what happened.

1462
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:38,504
That's what happened?

1463
01:46:38,504 --> 01:46:42,033
What happened Matthys,
after you joined the FEMA team?

1464
01:46:42,033 --> 01:46:45,825
Did you look for controlled demolition,
your initial hunch?

1465
01:46:45,825 --> 01:46:46,766
No.

1466
01:46:46,766 --> 01:46:50,421
Neither did this gentleman, Ronald
Hamburger, who also joined FEMA

1467
01:46:50,421 --> 01:46:51,099
after saying:

1468
01:46:51,099 --> 01:46:54,726
"It appeared to me that charges
had been placed in the building."

1469
01:46:55,424 --> 01:46:57,721
Never looked for controlled demolition?

1470
01:46:58,029 --> 01:47:00,805
How about foreknowledge of
these 2 buildings?

1471
01:47:00,805 --> 01:47:04,336
FEMA was on site with
their exercise 'Tripod 2'.

1472
01:47:04,336 --> 01:47:07,433
They had "hundreds of people from FEMA ,
the federal government,

1473
01:47:07,433 --> 01:47:09,311
from the state, from the Office of
the State Emergency Management .

1474
01:47:09,311 --> 01:47:14,429
They were getting ready for a drill in down
town Manhattan for a biochemical attack."

1475
01:47:14,914 --> 01:47:18,543
This is per New York mayor Giuliani.
Tom Kenney from FEMA says:

1476
01:47:18,543 --> 01:47:22,680
"We arrived on late on Monday night,
went right into action on Tuesday."

1477
01:47:22,884 --> 01:47:24,973
Coincidence?
Maybe.

1478
01:47:24,973 --> 01:47:26,638
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani:

1479
01:47:26,638 --> 01:47:30,436
I went down to the scene and we set up
headquarters on 75 Barclay Street,

1480
01:47:30,436 --> 01:47:33,116
which was right there with the police
commissioner and the fire commissioner,

1481
01:47:33,116 --> 01:47:36,578
the head of Emergency Management,
and we were operating out of there

1482
01:47:36,578 --> 01:47:39,968
when we were told that
the WTC was going to collapse.

1483
01:47:39,968 --> 01:47:45,637
Who gave you that warning?
Did you warn the firemen and women?

1484
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:48,687
We have plenty of video evidence,
you've seen.

1485
01:47:48,687 --> 01:47:54,362
And this suggests all the features
of a classic controlled demolition

1486
01:47:54,362 --> 01:48:00,431
with those exceptions which are
atypical of classic controlled demolition.

1487
01:48:00,431 --> 01:48:05,545
None of these features can be
accounted for by fire.

1488
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:10,386
Let alone all 10 of them.
We have supporting evidence.

1489
01:48:10,386 --> 01:48:15,760
This all goes to support the
hypothesis of controlled demolition.

1490
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,546
It's proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

1491
01:48:19,038 --> 01:48:22,790
If you're with me so far
you have big problems.

1492
01:48:22,797 --> 01:48:26,950
It's much easier, given our human nature,
to go right into paralysis and take

1493
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:32,175
no action because the implications
of this are absolutely staggering.

1494
01:48:32,175 --> 01:48:34,916
We come up with these kinds
of questions which are valid.

1495
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:36,815
"Our government wouldn't do this to us!"

1496
01:48:36,815 --> 01:48:39,507
Well, were not saying your
government did this to you.

1497
01:48:39,754 --> 01:48:43,992
Somebody was responsible for this.
Somebody, somewhere on the inside,

1498
01:48:43,992 --> 01:48:47,716
we don't know how high up it goes,
we don't know how wide it is.

1499
01:48:47,716 --> 01:48:50,056
"I would've heard about it by now!"

1500
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:54,598
You are hearing about it now!
I didn't hear about it until 2 years ago.

1501
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:01,790
"It couldn't have been kept
a secret that long!"

1502
01:49:01,923 --> 01:49:04,282
Well, the 'Manhattan Project'
had thousands of people ,

1503
01:49:04,282 --> 01:49:07,196
it was kept quite a secret
for a very long time.

1504
01:49:07,196 --> 01:49:09,896
"I'm not an expert in controlled demolition!"

1505
01:49:09,896 --> 01:49:16,226
Wait a minute, neither am I. But you are
the jury and you have an obligation

1506
01:49:16,226 --> 01:49:17,593
to make a decision.

1507
01:49:17,593 --> 01:49:20,894
Guilty or not guilty is typically the decision.

1508
01:49:20,894 --> 01:49:24,438
In this case explosive
controlled demolition or fire.

1509
01:49:24,438 --> 01:49:27,356
You have to take this information,
process it through your brain

1510
01:49:27,356 --> 01:49:31,388
and come up with a decision
and then a course of action.

1511
01:49:31,388 --> 01:49:33,503
I'm going to help you
with the course of action,

1512
01:49:33,503 --> 01:49:35,896
the decision is a little more difficult.

1513
01:49:36,329 --> 01:49:37,761
And don't do this:

1514
01:49:37,761 --> 01:49:41,163
"It's too horrible.
I don't even want to think about it!"

1515
01:49:41,657 --> 01:49:44,403
"I didn't even see this stuff tonight."

1516
01:49:44,403 --> 01:49:48,209
The worst form of denial.
You avoid the debate, go back to sleep

1517
01:49:48,209 --> 01:49:50,444
and become a part of the problem.

1518
01:49:50,444 --> 01:49:56,136
And it is a huge problem in America.
America is asleep at the wheel.

1519
01:49:56,136 --> 01:49:58,778
Very few of us know about this.

1520
01:49:58,899 --> 01:50:04,394
You've got to get motivated with this
information and take action based on

1521
01:50:04,394 --> 01:50:09,999
your response to this rational,
scientific, forensic based information.

1522
01:50:09,999 --> 01:50:12,893
Work through your fears.
Yes, there's fears.

1523
01:50:12,893 --> 01:50:16,817
If this happened to us then
it could happen again.

1524
01:50:16,817 --> 01:50:19,662
Then who's in control?
Who did I vote for?

1525
01:50:19,662 --> 01:50:22,057
There are a heck of a lot of questions.

1526
01:50:22,057 --> 01:50:26,846
We have disbelieves and mindsets
that are contrary to our acceptance

1527
01:50:26,846 --> 01:50:28,038
of this information.

1528
01:50:28,038 --> 01:50:31,297
There's no way to get a
handle on it for a lot of us.

1529
01:50:31,297 --> 01:50:35,627
I'm a Reagan Republican.
Consider what I had to go through.

1530
01:50:35,627 --> 01:50:40,308
We got to get informed and inform
every other architect and engineer

1531
01:50:40,308 --> 01:50:43,955
that you can find and
everybody else that you know.

1532
01:50:43,955 --> 01:50:47,370
Support a new investigation.

1533
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:51,040
Support these people who are
demanding a new investigation.

1534
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:56,922
How about 200 9/11 survivors and family
members, 110 military intelligence,

1535
01:50:56,922 --> 01:51:01,844
law enforcement and government officials,
170 distinguished professors,

1536
01:51:01,844 --> 01:51:04,862
110 entertainment and media professionals,

1537
01:51:04,862 --> 01:51:08,900
all endorsing a call for
a new probe into 9/11?

1538
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:14,530
Visit www.patriotsquestion911.com
and look for Andreas von Bulow,

1539
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:17,884
the former Defense Minister
of Germany who says:

1540
01:51:17,884 --> 01:51:22,316
"This is unthinkable, without year-long
support from secret apparatuses

1541
01:51:22,316 --> 01:51:24,485
of the state and industry."

1542
01:51:24,707 --> 01:51:27,213
How about Francesco Cossiga who says:

1543
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:31,918
"The disastrous attack was planned
and executed by the American CIA."

1544
01:51:31,918 --> 01:51:35,307
How about Yukihisa Fujita,
travelling around the world today,

1545
01:51:35,307 --> 01:51:41,438
prominent senator from Japan,
demanding a new investigation?

1546
01:51:41,438 --> 01:51:44,582
And Paul Hellyer, former Minister
of National Defense of Canada:

1547
01:51:44,582 --> 01:51:48,091
"I would like to see a much tougher,
more in-depth inquiry.

1548
01:51:48,091 --> 01:51:50,824
We have to try and get at the truth."

1549
01:51:50,824 --> 01:51:55,682
What happened to the truth? Let's take
a look at this quote from William Colby.

1550
01:51:55,682 --> 01:51:58,090
Maybe it can shed some light:

1551
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:04,146
"The CIA owns everyone
of any significance in the major media."

1552
01:52:04,265 --> 01:52:09,078
That's a heck of a statement from
the former director of the CIA.

1553
01:52:09,078 --> 01:52:10,415
What does it mean?

1554
01:52:10,415 --> 01:52:15,590
It's documented in many places,
including Project Censored, dedicated to

1555
01:52:15,590 --> 01:52:21,982
bringing all of us the 25 most censored
stories from the main stream media.

1556
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:27,152
Why did we not see the truth about 9/11?

1557
01:52:27,152 --> 01:52:32,406
Well, it appears as if our government
lied to us about the building collapses.

1558
01:52:32,406 --> 01:52:36,159
The 9/11 Commission Report reinforced that lie.

1559
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,872
FEMA and NIST justified it.

1560
01:52:38,872 --> 01:52:42,725
And the corporate media repeated
it and they hammered it in.

1561
01:52:42,725 --> 01:52:44,901
We really didn't have much of a chance.

1562
01:52:45,038 --> 01:52:50,585
We've shown here today that explosives
were used to destroy each of the 3

1563
01:52:50,585 --> 01:52:54,510
WTC high rise buildings on 9/11.

1564
01:52:54,510 --> 01:53:00,009
And it's known that it takes months
of planning to set up and engineer

1565
01:53:00,009 --> 01:53:02,153
and place these explosives.

1566
01:53:02,153 --> 01:53:06,738
Do we think that Al Qaeda had access
to these highly secure buildings?

1567
01:53:06,925 --> 01:53:09,997
So, unfortunately, this is just
the beginning of a disturbing

1568
01:53:09,997 --> 01:53:15,732
but very essential journey for you,
back into the nightmare of 9/11.

1569
01:53:15,732 --> 01:53:20,477
The evidence you've seen tonight is
just a small fraction of the vast body

1570
01:53:20,477 --> 01:53:23,817
of information that the 9/11
Truth Movement has assembled.

1571
01:53:23,817 --> 01:53:27,617
The questions raised are numerous
and ominous that must be answered

1572
01:53:27,617 --> 01:53:29,577
in a new investigation.

1573
01:53:29,577 --> 01:53:33,342
I encourage you to discover the
evidence that I have not had time

1574
01:53:33,342 --> 01:53:34,998
to bring to you tonight.

1575
01:53:35,139 --> 01:53:38,858
It will take thousands, perhaps millions of us.

1576
01:53:38,858 --> 01:53:43,970
Each one of us in this grass roots
movement has an ultimate responsibility

1577
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:48,617
to take the information that we
have provided and disseminate it.

1578
01:53:48,617 --> 01:53:52,706
Get the DVD, loan it to everybody you know.

1579
01:53:52,706 --> 01:53:55,001
You must become a truth bearer.

1580
01:53:55,001 --> 01:54:01,104
Email the AE911Truth.org link along with
a statement saying "CHECK THIS OUT"

1581
01:54:01,104 --> 01:54:05,604
to every architect and engineer you
can find and everybody you know.

1582
01:54:05,604 --> 01:54:08,788
We will turn heads in
the halls of congress.

1583
01:54:16,315 --> 01:54:21,933
Check out the other great DVD's
including '9/11 Mysteries'

1584
01:54:21,933 --> 01:54:24,942
which you've heard several clips from
tonight, and some great books

1585
01:54:24,942 --> 01:54:29,047
by David Ray Griffin including 'The New
Pearl Harbor' and his latest book

1586
01:54:29,047 --> 01:54:31,071
'9/11 Contradictions'.

1587
01:54:31,203 --> 01:54:35,342
Check out 'Loose Change,
2nd edition and Final Cut',

1588
01:54:35,342 --> 01:54:37,731
there's some great
information available there

1589
01:54:37,731 --> 01:54:46,793
and go to www.journalof911studies.com
and Steven Jones' website www.stj911.org .

1590
01:54:46,793 --> 01:54:50,023
Demand a real investigation.

1591
01:54:56,034 --> 01:54:58,263
Call and write your elected representatives,

1592
01:54:58,263 --> 01:55:02,213
write your local television stations,
radio stations, news papers.

1593
01:55:02,213 --> 01:55:06,844
Call in to talk shows, write to
national TV and radio networks.

1594
01:55:06,844 --> 01:55:11,281
Tell everyone you know.
Ask questions, demand answers.

1595
01:55:11,281 --> 01:55:17,801
Sign the AE911Truth.org petition.
Sign it, demanding a new investigation.

1596
01:55:17,801 --> 01:55:24,022
Stand up and be counted.
There's nothing to fear but fear itself.

1597
01:55:24,022 --> 01:55:27,128
Everyone can sign, architects
and engineers and all else.

1598
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:29,314
We have several categories of people.

1599
01:55:29,314 --> 01:55:32,056
Millions of people are studying
these matters, they're called

1600
01:55:32,056 --> 01:55:33,805
the 911 Truth Movement.

1601
01:55:34,562 --> 01:55:39,877
For the average person and for everyone
that has looked into this to any degree

1602
01:55:39,877 --> 01:55:43,959
there's no shortage of information,
evidence that, of course,

1603
01:55:43,959 --> 01:55:45,485
the buildings were blown up.

1604
01:55:45,485 --> 01:55:50,185
Why is it so difficult to get
people to simply just look?

1605
01:55:50,185 --> 01:55:53,486
There is difficulty. I mean it's not
even easy for me as an architect.

1606
01:55:53,486 --> 01:55:55,482
I've been studying this for 2 years.

1607
01:55:55,482 --> 01:56:00,526
So, when people aren't
open to this, I hear that.

1608
01:56:00,526 --> 01:56:02,560
Sometimes they are and it's refreshing.

1609
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,618
What you need to do is
get one of these cards.

1610
01:56:05,618 --> 01:56:08,289
We provide it.
You've got hundreds of architects.

1611
01:56:08,289 --> 01:56:13,594
We stick our necks out on the line for you.
Let them call us conspiracy theorists.

1612
01:56:13,594 --> 01:56:17,363
All you have to do is say that there
are a couple of hundred, 400 now,

1613
01:56:17,363 --> 01:56:20,493
architects and engineers
demanding a new investigation.

1614
01:56:20,493 --> 01:56:21,845
What do you think?

1615
01:56:22,123 --> 01:56:26,612
You're not saying "hey, I'm a conspiracy
theorist, here's my conspiracy". No.

1616
01:56:26,612 --> 01:56:31,031
Blame us and ask them:
"What does this picture look like to you?

1617
01:56:31,031 --> 01:56:32,359
I'm just curious."

1618
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:36,594
9 times out of 10 they'll say
"it's an explosion, it's a mushroom.

1619
01:56:36,594 --> 01:56:38,162
It's a volcano."

1620
01:56:38,345 --> 01:56:40,643
It's incredible the responses that you'll get.

1621
01:56:40,643 --> 01:56:44,424
Support us by becoming
a sustaining member.

1622
01:56:44,424 --> 01:56:45,656
You can make a difference.

1623
01:56:45,656 --> 01:56:51,322
We are a non-profit organization that
has our hands tied for lack of funds.

1624
01:56:51,322 --> 01:56:54,969
We need to get the word out
to the building professionals.

1625
01:56:54,969 --> 01:57:01,318
For 10 dollars a month, as little as that,
you can become a sustaining member.

1626
01:57:01,318 --> 01:57:05,995
Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth are
at the apex of the 9/11 Truth Movement.

1627
01:57:05,995 --> 01:57:11,904
Why? Because we have those who have the
necessary credibility to raise eyebrows

1628
01:57:11,904 --> 01:57:13,380
and gain attention.

1629
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:17,261
We need to get the vinyl banners,
the DVD's and brochures in the hands of

1630
01:57:17,261 --> 01:57:21,961
the real heroes of the 9/11 Truth Movement,
the people willing to get the message

1631
01:57:21,961 --> 01:57:23,603
out on the street.

1632
01:57:23,603 --> 01:57:25,457
www.wearechange.org,
www.truthaction.org ,

1633
01:57:25,457 --> 01:57:29,742
Project for a New American Citizen,
these folks need your support.

1634
01:57:29,742 --> 01:57:31,807
We need to act.

1635
01:57:31,807 --> 01:57:36,166
The power of truth is greater
than the power of the lie.

1636
01:57:36,166 --> 01:57:41,264
So get informed and begin to
let the truth speak through you.

1637
01:57:41,264 --> 01:57:45,962
Get informed through our website,
we've got all the information you need.

1638
01:57:45,962 --> 01:57:49,363
Sign the petition here.
Follow the red arrows.

1639
01:57:49,363 --> 01:57:53,263
Become a sustaining member here,
it's real easy.

1640
01:57:53,263 --> 01:57:59,993
Given the numerous warnings of far worse
terrorist attacks and war plans against Iran

1641
01:57:59,993 --> 01:58:02,899
that are in place we
need to do something.

1642
01:58:02,899 --> 01:58:08,512
Speak out, because a time comes
when your silence is betrayal.

1643
01:58:09,507 --> 01:58:13,611
Thank you so much for your attention today.
