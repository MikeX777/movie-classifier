1
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,655
Lonestar Barbecue Sauce,
the perfect partner for your chicken.

2
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,034
Can you just run it a few more times, Lee?

3
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:37,168
Lonestar Barbecue Sauce,
the perfect partner for your chicken.

4
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:43,967
Lonestar Barbecue Sauce,
the perfect partner for your chicken.

5
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:51,224
Lonestar Barbecue Sauce,
the perfect partner for your chicken.

6
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,436
You got it?

7
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,355
Can you do one more?

8
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,400
You want something different?

9
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,279
Just do one more.

10
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:13,788
Lonestar Barbecue Sauce,
the perfect partner for your chicken.

11
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:16,583
Yeah?

12
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:18,877
And do one more?

13
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:24,257
Lonestar Barbecue Sauce...

14
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:41,691
Hey, Peter.

15
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,318
Hey, Lee, how are you?

16
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:44,611
What's up?

17
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:46,738
Have you ever heard of a group called

18
00:02:46,946 --> 00:02:49,866
The Western Appreciation
and Preservation Guild?

19
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:52,118
No.

20
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,204
Well, I just got a call from them,

21
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,540
they want to give you
a Lifetime Achievement Award.

22
00:02:58,708 --> 00:02:59,542
Okay.

23
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:03,963
Lifetime, huh?

24
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:05,090
Yeah.

25
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,718
Is there anything else?

26
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:12,137
I don't know, there's some
sort of award ceremony.

27
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:16,141
I figured that. I mean, is
there anything else? Like...

28
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:18,603
Uh, I don't know.
A job offer? A script?

29
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:21,356
Not at the moment.

30
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:25,068
But we're expecting
some things soon, Lee.

31
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:28,571
Right.

32
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:23,334
Lee. Sorry to keep you waiting.

33
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,377
It's fine.

34
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,762
I know we were all
hoping to get good news about this biopsy.

35
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:38,766
But... I'm afraid I don't have good news.

36
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:56,422
Shit.

37
00:07:58,132 --> 00:07:59,342
Goddammit.

38
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,022
Lee.

39
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:15,400
Shit. You trying to
give me a heart attack?

40
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,652
I'm trying to get you to
open the god damn door.

41
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:18,945
That was a cop-knock.

42
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:22,782
You know, like you're a cop knocking.
That's how cops knock.

43
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,452
You wanna smoke some joints?

44
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:27,662
Yeah.

45
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,425
Are you okay?

46
00:08:42,635 --> 00:08:43,928
You seem a little...

47
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:45,346
off.

48
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,850
The thing is...

49
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:53,271
I got some news.

50
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:56,607
What news?

51
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:07,660
I wanna make a movie.

52
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:10,580
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

53
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,540
I had this dream last night...

54
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,001
Mm-stop right there.

55
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:16,793
Why?

56
00:09:16,794 --> 00:09:17,879
Question?

57
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:21,090
Do you like hearing
about other people's dreams?

58
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,176
I don't know.

59
00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:25,094
Sure.

60
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,305
- Really?
- Yeah.

61
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:28,806
Because for me...

62
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,642
hearing about
other people's dreams is...

63
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:35,271
You telling me you don't
wanna hear about my dream?

64
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,149
Yeah.

65
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,233
Fuck you.

66
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,569
It just doesn't interest me, man.

67
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,697
Think about it, I mean,
it's your dream.

68
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,282
What about movies?

69
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:48,034
Do they interest you?

70
00:09:48,534 --> 00:09:50,495
Yeah.
I love movies.

71
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:52,705
Movies are other people's dreams.

72
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,959
So...

73
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:59,253
You got an ounce of this shit, or what?

74
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:00,796
I need it.

75
00:10:01,631 --> 00:10:02,632
An ounce?

76
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:03,633
Yeah.

77
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:06,427
One ounce of the devil's lettuce.

78
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:09,305
That's gonna clean me out, man.

79
00:10:11,516 --> 00:10:14,477
I don't why you just can't go to the store
like everybody else.

80
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:16,521
I like coming here.

81
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:18,898
Yeah?

82
00:10:20,024 --> 00:10:22,693
You are a creature of habit,
if ever there was one.

83
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:25,821
It's called Platinum Cookies.

84
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:28,157
It's a blend, it's real good shit.

85
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:30,910
Platinum Cookies.

86
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:36,082
Platinum Cookies, the real good shit.

87
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,584
Say that, just-just that.

88
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:42,797
Platinum Cookies.

89
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:46,008
The real good shit.

90
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:48,219
Oh, my God.

91
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:51,347
That voice could sell
a shit ton of weed, my friend.

92
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,894
What's this?

93
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,021
Shrooms.

94
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,024
Break in case of emergency.

95
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:56,996
Who's that?

96
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:03,461
Oh, hey.

97
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,546
Charlotte, come on in.

98
00:12:05,796 --> 00:12:07,006
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

99
00:12:09,175 --> 00:12:11,177
God, it... place smells like
fish sells in here.

100
00:12:11,636 --> 00:12:14,138
Yeah, we're just finishing
a little afternoon snack.

101
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:17,391
Lee, Charlotte.
Charlotte, Lee.

102
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:19,352
Hey.

103
00:12:20,102 --> 00:12:21,020
Hi.

104
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:24,106
I'll be right back.
Don't worry, he's cool.

105
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:51,550
You're staring at me.

106
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:53,844
Sorry.

107
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:57,264
I didn't say I had a problem
with it, I was just simply...

108
00:12:58,349 --> 00:12:59,183
pointing it out.

109
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:01,977
I like trying to figure people out.

110
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:07,525
I think you can figure out a lot
about a person by just looking at them.

111
00:13:10,236 --> 00:13:11,153
Okay.

112
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,616
So, what'd you figure out about me?

113
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:17,785
Not a thing.

114
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:26,836
How do I know you?

115
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:30,673
I know you from something.

116
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:33,300
If you say so.

117
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:35,886
Are you an actor?

118
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:38,889
Yeah.

119
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:43,102
All the actors I know are
self-centered and insane.

120
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,231
Sounds about right.

121
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:55,531
You're staring at me now?

122
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:57,825
Yeah.

123
00:13:58,993 --> 00:14:02,329
Seeing if I can... figure you out.

124
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:04,665
Can you?

125
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:08,002
You seem sad.

126
00:14:11,255 --> 00:14:12,256
There you go.

127
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:14,216
Thanks.

128
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,178
It's all here, but... count it.

129
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:19,972
Don't drink
too much with these.

130
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,974
Thanks.

131
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:27,855
Jesus!
Get some sun, man.

132
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,316
Nice to meet you, um...

133
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,819
Sorry, I forgot your name.

134
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:36,614
- Lee.
- Right. Lee.

135
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:40,201
They say that memory
is the second thing to go.

136
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:43,621
And what's the first?

137
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:45,122
I can't remember.

138
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:49,293
How do you two know each other?

139
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:52,671
We were on a TV show together.

140
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:54,465
Nothing you've ever heard of.

141
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,718
It's called Cattle Drive.
It ran for 13 episodes.

142
00:14:58,469 --> 00:14:59,428
Lee was the lead.

143
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,596
Ben Horn, a gun slinger.

144
00:15:01,597 --> 00:15:02,431
Whoa.

145
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,559
I was a cocky kid who stole
the wrong man's horse.

146
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,020
- You mean you had a real job once?
- Yeah.

147
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,648
Had a wife too.
So did he.

148
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:12,858
Now, we just have each other.

149
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,319
Well.

150
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:19,031
Nice to meet you, Lee.

151
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:59,154
This one, and this one.

152
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:08,622
What a nice surprise.

153
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:11,041
A nice surprise?

154
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:18,632
Good to see you, Val.

155
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:19,842
Sure it is.

156
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,147
You getting ready for another show?

157
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,482
Yes, at the end of the month.

158
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:51,290
Have you seen Lucy recently?

159
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,920
Yes, she came over for dinner,
we watched some TV on Sunday.

160
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,217
What'd you watch?

161
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:06,013
You wanna know what
we watched on television?

162
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,474
I haven't seen Lucy in a long time.

163
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:09,600
Call her.

164
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,644
She doesn't want me to call her.

165
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:12,853
Don't do that.

166
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:15,356
I don't blame her.

167
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:23,864
You should call her.

168
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,304
I've got something I wanna tell you.

169
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,481
I'm gonna make a movie.

170
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:05,990
Peter Cohen's office.

171
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,366
Hey, Chelsea, it's Lee, for Peter.

172
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:11,203
- Hi, Lee, let me see if I have him.
- Thanks.

173
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,083
Lee, what's up?

174
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,585
When did you say
that thing was again?

175
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,255
- The Western award?
- Yeah.

176
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:48,657
Dad.

177
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,534
You look good out there.

178
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:55,164
Remember when we used to play?

179
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,293
What are you doing here?

180
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:03,714
I mean, how did you know I was here?

181
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:05,591
Your mother told me.

182
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:08,969
I was in the neighborhood, and I just...

183
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:13,766
How's work going?

184
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:16,643
Still waiting tables at that steakhouse?

185
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:18,604
I liked that place.

186
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:22,858
I work for Google.

187
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:25,277
Oh.

188
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:27,696
Yeah, I sell advertising space for them.

189
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:29,907
Wow.

190
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,118
Yeah.

191
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,496
What's up?

192
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:38,665
Oh.

193
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,501
I guess it's been a while, huh?

194
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:42,628
Yeah.

195
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:45,839
You look the same though.

196
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,300
That's good, I guess.

197
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:55,682
I was thinking, uh...

198
00:19:59,353 --> 00:20:02,606
I'm getting this lifetime
achievement award thing, and uh...

199
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:05,359
it's no big deal but,

200
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:09,988
I was thinking maybe
you'd like to go with me...

201
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:11,990
to the ceremony.

202
00:20:15,911 --> 00:20:16,912
When is it?

203
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:18,497
Sunday.

204
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:20,582
This Sunday?

205
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:24,044
I'm going to Palm Springs
with Jake. I can't cancel.

206
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:26,338
Right.

207
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:28,924
Okay.

208
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,219
How about dinner when you get back?

209
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:37,641
My treat.
You pick the place, time, whatever.

210
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:45,107
I'm free Tuesday.

211
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,902
Yeah. Yeah, that'll be great.

212
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:53,615
I got to get back.

213
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,293
I'll see ya.
Tuesday.

214
00:21:35,657 --> 00:21:36,742
Hello?

215
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:40,204
Hello, Mr. Hayden?
It's Nina calling from Cedars-Sinai.

216
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:44,416
Dr. Friedburg would like to schedule
your first oncology appointment.

217
00:21:45,792 --> 00:21:46,960
Oh?

218
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,713
Are you available tomorrow
morning at 11:00?

219
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:52,716
Tomorrow morning?

220
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:55,219
Um...

221
00:21:55,594 --> 00:21:57,763
Dr. Friedburg would
like to discuss your treatment plan

222
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,514
with you as soon as possible.

223
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,102
Is there another time
that might be better for you?

224
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:08,440
I'm actually in the middle
of something right now, could...

225
00:22:09,024 --> 00:22:11,401
- Can I call you back?
- Yeah, that's fine.

226
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:31,166
Best tacos in L.A., right?

227
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:32,876
Yeah.

228
00:24:33,877 --> 00:24:35,003
You live around here?

229
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,380
No.

230
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:39,549
Stalking you.

231
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:41,301
Yeah.

232
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:45,180
Charlotte, right?

233
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:48,350
Got a good memory for an old pot-head.

234
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:50,727
A sad old pot-head.

235
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,480
Why did you say that anyway?

236
00:24:54,815 --> 00:24:58,151
Um, because you're old
and you smoke a lot of weed.

237
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,737
I mean, the part about me being sad.

238
00:25:04,032 --> 00:25:05,033
I don't know.

239
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,244
Are you?

240
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:12,082
Nothing wrong with that.

241
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:21,800
Are you married?

242
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,138
Divorced.
Have been for a long time.

243
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:32,436
So are you gonna ask for my number?

244
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,481
You want me to?

245
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,694
Yeah.

246
00:25:41,945 --> 00:25:44,489
What? You got a thing for
sad old guys or something?

247
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:46,950
No.

248
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:48,243
Just old guys.

249
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:00,130
You doing anything on Sunday night?

250
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,486
Cheers.

251
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:25,030
To achieving things in a lifetime.

252
00:26:25,447 --> 00:26:26,615
Sure.

253
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:40,712
What's that?

254
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,715
Fairy powder.

255
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:45,467
Uh-huh.

256
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:49,387
It's something that
will make you feel great.

257
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:52,849
I'm feeling pretty good right now.

258
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:55,810
Oh, yeah?

259
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:08,698
It won't kill you, I promise.
But no peer pressure.

260
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:12,786
Give me that stuff.

261
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:23,213
You really like burning
the candle at both ends, don't you?

262
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:25,632
It seems like you do too.

263
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,600
You know who came up with that?

264
00:27:37,227 --> 00:27:38,478
"Burning the candle at both ends"?

265
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:40,689
Who's that?

266
00:27:41,982 --> 00:27:43,567
Edna St. Vincent Millay.

267
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:51,449
"My candle burns at both ends,

268
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:53,660
"It will not last the night,

269
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:57,414
"But, ah, my foes, and oh, my friends,

270
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,583
It gives a lovely light!"

271
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,211
Isn't it great?

272
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:05,755
It's called First Fig.

273
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,223
What?

274
00:28:17,976 --> 00:28:19,185
I'm thinking.

275
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:21,896
What are you thinking?

276
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:26,276
That if you were maybe
20 years older, I'd probably kiss you.

277
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:29,029
I got to wait 20 years?

278
00:28:29,738 --> 00:28:30,989
You'll be dead in 20 years.

279
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:34,451
Don't remind me.

280
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:41,249
So, you're ready for tonight?

281
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:45,462
Not really.

282
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:49,090
Are you gonna give a speech?

283
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:53,428
They'll be expecting that.

284
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,181
Just talk about all your
lifetime achievements.

285
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:00,810
I did one film that I'm proud of.

286
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:03,438
That was 40 years ago.

287
00:29:04,356 --> 00:29:07,025
Since then, I've stayed busy,
but I wouldn't say I've been...

288
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:10,195
achieving.

289
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:16,743
It's kinda weird being
remembered for one part for so many years.

290
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:18,828
Yeah?

291
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,084
But it's about as close to immortality
as any person can get.

292
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:26,711
You haven't even seen it.

293
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:28,630
I don't need to see it.

294
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,383
I've got you right here.

295
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:34,511
Got the man himself.

296
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,181
The Hero.

297
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:43,436
Okay.

298
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,333
So, when is this
fairy powder going to kick in?

299
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:06,835
Pretty soon.

300
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:10,296
And then this is going to seem like
the greatest party of all time.

301
00:30:10,964 --> 00:30:11,965
It better.

302
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:13,633
Mr. Hayden.

303
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:16,010
- Please, call me Lee.
- Gary.

304
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:19,222
Gary Babcock, I'm the...
the president of the...

305
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:21,766
the Western Appreciation
and Preservation Guild.

306
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:23,560
We're-we're so honored to have you here.

307
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:25,061
I'm honored to be here, Gary.

308
00:30:25,603 --> 00:30:27,313
- This is-
- Hi, I'm Cathy Lee.

309
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:28,398
Cathy Lee.

310
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,278
- Funny.
- Isn't it?

311
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:34,738
When I met him I thought,

312
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:36,740
this must be meant to be.

313
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:38,867
Uh-huh.

314
00:30:39,743 --> 00:30:43,329
This is such a cool event,
such a... diverse crowd.

315
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:46,708
Uh, yeah. Sure.

316
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:52,087
Well, would you mind stepping over?
We'd like to get a few pictures.

317
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:52,964
Sure.

318
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:54,716
- You too, Cathy Lee.
- You bet.

319
00:30:58,887 --> 00:31:00,346
- Oh.
- Woah. Pardon me, darlin'.

320
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:01,639
No, I'm...

321
00:31:03,016 --> 00:31:06,686
I mean, you can bump
into me anytime you want, Mr. Hayden.

322
00:31:06,936 --> 00:31:09,856
Well, there you go.

323
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:12,776
I'm Betsy.

324
00:31:13,026 --> 00:31:14,068
How do you do, Betsy?

325
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:16,780
I'm such a huge fan.

326
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,323
Well, thank you.

327
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:21,159
Would you mind signing
something for me?

328
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:23,787
- I'll be happy to.
- Really appreciate it.

329
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:26,039
Here.

330
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:29,501
To Betsy.

331
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:34,506
My bumpin' buddy.

332
00:31:36,716 --> 00:31:37,926
I love that.

333
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:41,638
Thank you.

334
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:43,722
- Here you go, Betsy.
- Thank you so much.

335
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:47,227
- You're so welcome.
- And I just love your mustache.

336
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:49,145
Well...

337
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:51,815
It loves you too.

338
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:53,775
Mr. Hayden.

339
00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:56,277
Would you mind stepping over here?

340
00:31:59,113 --> 00:32:01,032
Yep, I feel it too.

341
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:21,695
Well now,
the man I'm about to introduce

342
00:33:21,696 --> 00:33:24,115
needs no introduction.

343
00:33:24,699 --> 00:33:26,117
You all know this year's recipient.

344
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:31,706
His... his unmistakable voice,
his iconic mustache,

345
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:35,543
made him one of most popular
actors in the 1970s and 80s.

346
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:40,048
His turn as "The Hero"
in the film by the same name is-is

347
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:42,508
widely considered one of the...

348
00:33:43,217 --> 00:33:45,762
one of the greatest western
performances of all time.

349
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:48,097
Let's take a look.

350
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:50,391
The one, the only, Lee Hayden.

351
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:08,368
Hold it right there, friend.
We been lookin' for you.

352
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,161
Is that right?

353
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:58,584
Ladies and gentlemen, the Western Icon
Lifetime Achievement Award recipient

354
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:01,838
for this year, Mr. Lee Hayden.

355
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:29,782
Thank you.

356
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,119
Wow.

357
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,372
I don't know what to say.

358
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:42,336
Awards are a strange thing.

359
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,840
I mean, what does it
say about you?

360
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:52,388
Before I came here tonight, I looked up
"achievement" in the dictionary.

361
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,974
It's not a difficult word.

362
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,060
We all know what it means.

363
00:35:59,187 --> 00:36:00,438
But I looked it up anyway.

364
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:02,899
Looked it up on my phone.

365
00:36:05,443 --> 00:36:10,865
And it said,
"the result of hard work."

366
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,163
Well, I certainly have worked hard.

367
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,293
But the thing is...

368
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:27,006
I know there are a lot
of others out there who

369
00:36:29,008 --> 00:36:31,511
are more deserving
than I am of this award.

370
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:35,223
And so, I'm not sure why I'm
standing up here right now.

371
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,060
Not sure I deserve this.

372
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:42,438
Any of this.

373
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:46,234
We love you, Lee.

374
00:36:48,236 --> 00:36:49,403
I love you too.

375
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,535
I do.
I feel that love.

376
00:36:58,579 --> 00:36:59,539
Deeply.

377
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,293
I'm nothing without all of you.

378
00:37:06,462 --> 00:37:07,547
Just a grain of sand.

379
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:15,054
And that's the thing,
we're all just grains of sand.

380
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:19,016
We're just people.

381
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:22,353
People working hard and
trying to do our best.

382
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:24,689
Aren't we?

383
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,732
- Yeah.
- Yes.

384
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,987
I'm no better than you
and you're no better than me.

385
00:37:32,697 --> 00:37:36,701
Everyone in this room
is as deserving as I am of this award.

386
00:37:43,249 --> 00:37:44,333
Like you, Miss.

387
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,504
Yes, ma'am, you.

388
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:53,092
Come here.
It's okay, come on up.

389
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:55,344
Come on up.

390
00:38:09,525 --> 00:38:11,110
What's your name, darlin'?

391
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:12,695
Diane.

392
00:38:13,446 --> 00:38:14,488
Diane.

393
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:20,161
Wow, this jacket you've
got on sure is...

394
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:22,997
soft.

395
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,751
Tell you what, Diane,

396
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:29,587
you are my...

397
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:33,674
Western Icon Lifetime
Achievement award winner.

398
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:37,303
Here you go.
Diane, everybody.

399
00:38:42,558 --> 00:38:44,101
Diane is my hero.

400
00:38:45,728 --> 00:38:46,896
Let's hear it for Diane.

401
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:50,358
She is a fucking icon.

402
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,365
Diane! Diane!

403
00:38:58,658 --> 00:39:01,369
Diane! Diane! Diane! Diane!

404
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,373
Hold it right there, friend.

405
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:56,507
We've been looking for you.

406
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:01,637
- That right?
- Not just us.

407
00:40:02,888 --> 00:40:05,182
Got to be at least
eight bounties on your head.

408
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:08,269
We intend to collect on all of 'em.

409
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:10,980
What?

410
00:40:11,314 --> 00:40:13,899
Do you think you can keep
running like this forever?

411
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:19,655
You can't outrun destiny, amigo.

412
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:24,410
And they call you "The Hero."

413
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:27,913
But we know who you really are.

414
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:47,975
And that's a cut.

415
00:40:48,726 --> 00:40:49,810
Everybody take five.

416
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:51,478
Thanks, Lee.

417
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:20,341
Hey, Dad.

418
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:22,259
How was the procedure?

419
00:41:22,843 --> 00:41:24,178
You know what I always said?

420
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:26,180
I'm not going anywhere.

421
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:17,481
Hi.

422
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,403
Morning.
Coffee?

423
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:24,071
Yes.

424
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:36,000
Thanks.

425
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:40,171
Did we, uh...

426
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,175
No.

427
00:42:45,176 --> 00:42:46,802
Molly usually isn't good
for that sort of thing.

428
00:42:49,138 --> 00:42:50,264
We did other stuff though.

429
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:52,558
Other stuff?

430
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:55,561
Yeah, we went out.
After the ceremony.

431
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,022
We went out?

432
00:42:58,564 --> 00:42:59,440
Yeah.

433
00:43:00,232 --> 00:43:02,193
To a few bars, and a club.

434
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:06,655
You, um... danced.
A lot.

435
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:18,292
How old are you?

436
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:22,296
How old are you?

437
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:23,380
Seventy...

438
00:43:24,256 --> 00:43:25,216
One.

439
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:27,301
Why do you wanna know
how old I am?

440
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:29,803
Because this seems a little odd.

441
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:31,722
- Does it?
- Yeah.

442
00:43:32,473 --> 00:43:35,142
I mean you look like you could be my
daughter's age for Christ's sake.

443
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,686
Jesus.
Don't make it weird.

444
00:43:38,103 --> 00:43:39,188
It is a little weird.

445
00:43:41,941 --> 00:43:43,108
How old's your daughter?

446
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:46,445
Thirty four.

447
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:48,364
Cool, well...
I'm older than her.

448
00:43:49,031 --> 00:43:50,032
Still.

449
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,996
Look, I'm just a little...
confused right now.

450
00:43:58,165 --> 00:43:59,625
I don't understand why you're here.

451
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:02,628
You asked me out, right?

452
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:04,671
Yeah.

453
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:05,506
So, what the fuck, man.

454
00:44:05,714 --> 00:44:07,675
I'm not busting your balls
because you're older than my dad.

455
00:44:08,842 --> 00:44:09,677
But whatever.

456
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:12,763
If you've got
a problem with it, I'll go.

457
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,557
No, I don't want you to go.

458
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:17,017
Okay so, what do you want?

459
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:21,689
I don't know.

460
00:44:23,566 --> 00:44:25,067
Don't think so hard about it, man.

461
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:27,570
You're thinking about it
instead of just...

462
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:33,993
Can I have some milk in my coffee?

463
00:44:35,202 --> 00:44:36,412
I'm sorry.

464
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,465
I'm here because I wanna be here.

465
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:52,344
Trust me, I got plenty
of places I could be.

466
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,431
But I'm here with you.

467
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:59,268
But if you don't
want me here, I can go.

468
00:45:01,478 --> 00:45:05,107
After I drink my coffee.
'Cause this coffee's pretty good.

469
00:45:06,567 --> 00:45:07,776
That's Folgers.

470
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:23,876
I don't want you to go.

471
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:12,401
Can't find my phone.

472
00:47:13,986 --> 00:47:14,903
You got to call somebody?

473
00:47:16,905 --> 00:47:18,407
I like to check in once in a while.

474
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:26,706
Lee, oh, my God!

475
00:47:26,707 --> 00:47:27,750
What?

476
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:29,835
You're trending on Twitter.

477
00:47:31,336 --> 00:47:33,422
Your speech last night...
I got a text from Jeremy.

478
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:36,592
Oh, my God, it went viral, dude.

479
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:39,303
TMZ, Entertainment Weekly,

480
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:42,806
Jezebel... Holy shit!
You went viral, dude.

481
00:47:43,223 --> 00:47:44,432
What're you talking about?

482
00:47:44,433 --> 00:47:47,603
Your speech. When you
brought that lady up on stage...

483
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:49,730
Okay, yeah.

484
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,356
People are going nuts over it.

485
00:47:52,274 --> 00:47:53,358
Oh, my God!

486
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:56,195
Diane! They interviewed Diane!

487
00:47:58,572 --> 00:48:00,449
Man, we really got to find your phone.

488
00:48:02,326 --> 00:48:03,744
I'm not sure I want to know.

489
00:48:06,663 --> 00:48:07,998
Let's forget about the phone.

490
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,729
You have a job to go to or what?

491
00:48:32,397 --> 00:48:33,774
What do you do anyway?

492
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:43,158
So you wanna like...
get to know me or something?

493
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:46,119
Yeah, I do.

494
00:48:50,457 --> 00:48:51,542
I'm a comedian.

495
00:48:54,002 --> 00:48:57,714
- A comedian?
- Yeah, I do stand-up.

496
00:49:00,968 --> 00:49:02,177
I have a show tonight actually.

497
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:05,097
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

498
00:49:14,982 --> 00:49:16,108
Wanna come?

499
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:18,694
You want me to?

500
00:49:22,322 --> 00:49:23,657
Yeah, sure.

501
00:49:25,367 --> 00:49:27,953
Hotel Cafe, eight o'clock.

502
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:31,331
I'll let you know.

503
00:49:37,337 --> 00:49:39,923
Are you gonna tell me
how old you are or what?

504
00:49:52,936 --> 00:49:55,147
Diane, my hero.

505
00:49:55,814 --> 00:49:56,899
Let's hear it for Diane.

506
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,112
She's a fucking icon!

507
00:50:06,325 --> 00:50:09,745
You've got almost
two million views in less than 24 hours.

508
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,455
- And that's a good thing?
- Fuck yeah, man.

509
00:50:12,456 --> 00:50:15,083
Everybody's talking about you today.
They love you.

510
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:16,919
Check this out.

511
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:19,463
Hey, wait a minute, what...

512
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:21,548
What is this thing here?

513
00:50:22,758 --> 00:50:24,092
You don't know about the iceberg?

514
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,719
No.

515
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:29,681
Success is just the tip
of the iceberg, man.

516
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:31,934
But underneath...

517
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:35,562
is all your experiences
that made that iceberg.

518
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:39,316
And you're the only one
who knows what's really down there.

519
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:44,237
It's a metaphor.

520
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,491
People look at you and
they only see the success.

521
00:50:52,037 --> 00:50:54,538
It's like a figurative
representation, like poetry-

522
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:55,582
Yeah, I see.
I get it.

523
00:50:57,042 --> 00:50:59,461
What I don't get is why this
is on your computer.

524
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:02,798
'Cause it's true.

525
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:13,141
- Hey, Peter.
- Lee.

526
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:14,851
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

527
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:16,561
Yeah, what's up?

528
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:18,271
What did you get into last night?

529
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,023
I don't know.

530
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:23,694
Well, the phone has not stopped ringing
for you all day.

531
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:25,696
For what?

532
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:27,572
For work.

533
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:31,535
I got offers, I got scripts,
more commercial work.

534
00:51:33,245 --> 00:51:34,997
I just got a call and they
wanna bring you in

535
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,041
for this massive new
movie called Galactic.

536
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,793
Are you serious?

537
00:51:40,293 --> 00:51:41,377
Yeah.

538
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:44,047
It's this fantasy thing,
based on a young adult novel

539
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,049
and there's a great role
in it for you.

540
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:49,136
This guy is the ultimate cowboy.

541
00:51:49,636 --> 00:51:50,721
So, there's an offer?

542
00:51:52,055 --> 00:51:53,807
You just need
to come in and audition.

543
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:57,227
I haven't auditioned in
40 fucking years, Peter.

544
00:51:57,477 --> 00:51:58,978
They want you
to come in tomorrow.

545
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:00,022
Tomorrow?

546
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,524
You can't say no to this, Lee.

547
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:04,317
You just can't.

548
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:09,406
Look, the thing is, I got some...

549
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:15,662
All right.

550
00:52:16,163 --> 00:52:17,414
Fax over the pages.

551
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,168
Wow.

552
00:52:23,003 --> 00:52:24,254
You still fax?

553
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:44,983
You seem a little tense.

554
00:52:46,526 --> 00:52:48,028
I'm just trying to focus here, man.

555
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:49,404
This helps me focus.

556
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:52,990
Helps me come off the mountain, man.

557
00:52:52,991 --> 00:52:55,077
What fucking mountain
are you talking about?

558
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:18,308
Thought you were already
making a movie.

559
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,060
It was a pipe dream.

560
00:53:22,104 --> 00:53:23,063
This is real.

561
00:53:26,233 --> 00:53:27,234
Okay.

562
00:53:39,788 --> 00:53:42,541
Jesus Christ. You're making me crazy
with all that moving around.

563
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,501
Sorry.

564
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:54,761
You wanna run lines?

565
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:00,600
Who are you?

566
00:54:01,643 --> 00:54:02,727
They call me Turner.

567
00:54:04,312 --> 00:54:05,147
Turner?

568
00:54:05,438 --> 00:54:06,314
That's right.

569
00:54:07,149 --> 00:54:08,233
And I'm here to help you.

570
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,402
But why?

571
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:13,196
Because you're my daughter.

572
00:54:15,574 --> 00:54:16,867
I've come to save you.

573
00:54:18,493 --> 00:54:21,371
And I need you to come with me.
Now.

574
00:54:21,955 --> 00:54:22,789
My father?

575
00:54:23,832 --> 00:54:25,167
You're not my father.

576
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:26,585
Listen to me.

577
00:54:27,419 --> 00:54:30,045
If we don't go now,
we're as good as dead.

578
00:54:30,046 --> 00:54:32,507
My father is dead.
He died a long time ago.

579
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:33,924
It's me.

580
00:54:33,925 --> 00:54:35,177
You don't even look like him!

581
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,762
I had to change the way I look
to protect you.

582
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:40,223
I did die.

583
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:44,227
In some ways, I've been
dead for a long time.

584
00:54:46,104 --> 00:54:47,272
I had to leave you.

585
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:49,983
But I did that to save you.

586
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:53,612
You were better off thinking I was dead.

587
00:54:56,531 --> 00:54:58,700
When I heard the council
was coming after you...

588
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:01,411
well...

589
00:55:03,371 --> 00:55:05,081
let's just say
I'm not dead anymore.

590
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:08,710
I'm your father.

591
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:11,463
And I'm here to help you.

592
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:15,050
I love you.

593
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,053
And you have to come with me.

594
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:21,848
You have to come
with me now, or we'll both die.

595
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:29,356
You remember what I
always used to call you?

596
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:33,526
Buttercup.

597
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:37,447
It's me, Buttercup.

598
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:43,662
I've been gone for a long time.

599
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:47,791
And I may not look the same.

600
00:55:49,793 --> 00:55:50,710
But it's me.

601
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:54,422
I'm here now.

602
00:55:56,675 --> 00:55:59,636
I'm here now, and that's...
That's all that matters.

603
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:11,231
Fuck yeah, man.

604
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,614
I think you're good.

605
00:56:42,637 --> 00:56:44,096
A lot of people, when they get married

606
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:46,307
they register at some bullshit place,

607
00:56:46,308 --> 00:56:48,601
like Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel...

608
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:51,645
I had a friend who works for a non-profit.

609
00:56:51,646 --> 00:56:54,816
She registered
for asparagus peelers.

610
00:56:57,444 --> 00:56:58,778
Bitch, you don't have a bed frame.

611
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:02,490
You can't afford asparagus,

612
00:57:03,408 --> 00:57:05,285
the gay uncle of broccoli.

613
00:57:10,206 --> 00:57:13,251
My husband and I, when we registered,
we registered somewhere practical.

614
00:57:14,294 --> 00:57:15,670
Kaiser Permanente.

615
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:19,132
We got IVF treatments
and pap smears.

616
00:57:22,135 --> 00:57:23,261
Hey, what can I get you?

617
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:25,305
- Can I have a Michter's, neat, please?
- Yeah.

618
00:57:25,638 --> 00:57:26,639
Say...

619
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,099
Make it a beer.

620
00:57:28,475 --> 00:57:30,602
- Whatever's on tap.
- Okay. Be right back.

621
00:57:30,894 --> 00:57:34,063
Last dude I dated, his little
brother worked at an ice cream truck

622
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:36,149
right outside of my house
in New York.

623
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:39,611
And every day he would
give me free ice cream.

624
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,615
And one day he pops his head
out of the truck and he was like, "Ali,

625
00:57:44,491 --> 00:57:46,117
have you seen my brother?

626
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,497
Oh, my God, you don't know this,
but he's bi-polar.

627
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,791
And he's gone missing."

628
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:56,460
And I was like, "Oh, my God."

629
00:58:00,757 --> 00:58:03,343
"Do I still get free ice cream?"

630
00:58:04,678 --> 00:58:06,471
All right, I've been Ali Wong.
Have a good night, everybody.

631
00:58:10,683 --> 00:58:12,143
Give it up for Ali Wong!

632
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:19,234
Ali just got married,

633
00:58:20,693 --> 00:58:21,986
I also just got married.

634
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:28,784
I loved your speech, by the way.

635
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:30,869
Obviously...
I married a woman.

636
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:31,788
Thanks.

637
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:33,581
You have eyes on your face.

638
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:36,334
This is not the haircut of a woman
who sleeps with men.

639
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:39,838
You guys, we're gonna
keep the show right on rolling.

640
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,299
If you loved Ali, you'll love this next
comic. I have known her forever.

641
00:58:43,466 --> 00:58:44,759
She is hilarious.

642
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,345
Let's hear it now for Charlotte Dillon.
Give it up for her.

643
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,472
Come on!

644
00:58:52,225 --> 00:58:57,188
All right, keep it going for Cameron
Esposito, our awesome host.

645
00:58:59,149 --> 00:58:59,983
So...

646
00:59:01,025 --> 00:59:02,318
I want to tell you
about my day, I had-I had...

647
00:59:03,153 --> 00:59:04,237
an extremely productive day.

648
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:06,906
My parents would be
very proud of me.

649
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:11,286
Um, I met a guy,
and then I fucked him.

650
00:59:11,744 --> 00:59:12,787
Yeah.

651
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:14,289
But it's not-
but it's not what you think.

652
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:17,250
I met him through someone
who's really trustworthy:

653
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:18,835
my drug dealer.

654
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:21,463
Oh, my God.

655
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,631
Young guys, right?

656
00:59:23,923 --> 00:59:25,467
Young guys, I'm over you guys.

657
00:59:25,884 --> 00:59:28,136
I'm over it. The guy
that I'm fucking right now,

658
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:29,679
older.

659
00:59:30,722 --> 00:59:32,265
Older. And I'm not talking like,

660
00:59:33,016 --> 00:59:34,267
forty seven or something.

661
00:59:34,976 --> 00:59:38,062
I'm talking 70 plus, bitches.

662
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:40,690
Oh, yeah! Oh-hoh!

663
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:43,942
Full on senior citizen.
Like...

664
00:59:43,943 --> 00:59:47,155
Allowed to withdraw
from a Roth IRA with no penalty.

665
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:50,366
Remembers when TV was like
black and white and shit.

666
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:53,244
But here's the thing...
Older guys,

667
00:59:53,995 --> 00:59:54,913
they're awesome.

668
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,874
They're awesome,
they're experienced...

669
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,126
you know, they know
how to treat a lady.

670
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:02,003
They go slow.

671
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:04,297
Because they have to.

672
01:00:06,466 --> 01:00:07,800
But okay, can we...

673
01:00:08,968 --> 01:00:10,595
can we just talk about
the balls for a second?

674
01:00:11,971 --> 01:00:13,890
Right? Let's just, we're gonna
talk about it.

675
01:00:14,098 --> 01:00:15,265
I feel like we know each other now.

676
01:00:15,266 --> 01:00:17,769
These balls have dropped.

677
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:20,939
Golf balls sitting at the bottom
of a tube sock.

678
01:00:23,983 --> 01:00:25,026
It was actually kinda hot.

679
01:00:26,027 --> 01:00:26,861
But you know what's even hotter?

680
01:00:28,029 --> 01:00:28,988
Keeping his heart rate steady.

681
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:30,823
Serious.

682
01:00:31,032 --> 01:00:33,660
I mean, what's naughtier than fucking
someone who could die any second?

683
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:36,120
You know?

684
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,914
It's like...

685
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:42,835
So, yesterday...

686
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:45,380
Right? Let's talk about
yesterday. Enough about today.

687
01:01:34,512 --> 01:01:36,556
In some ways I've been
dead for a long time.

688
01:01:38,224 --> 01:01:41,728
I had to... I had to change the way I look
to protect you.

689
01:01:43,646 --> 01:01:44,772
I did die.

690
01:01:46,274 --> 01:01:47,150
I had to go.

691
01:01:48,401 --> 01:01:49,319
I'm leaving.

692
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,320
I'm your father.

693
01:01:52,447 --> 01:01:53,406
And I'm here to...

694
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:55,533
I'm your father.

695
01:02:08,713 --> 01:02:09,756
Mr. Hayden.

696
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,674
We're ready for you.

697
01:02:15,678 --> 01:02:17,597
Hey! There he is.

698
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:20,308
Good to see you, buddy.

699
01:02:20,642 --> 01:02:22,434
Thanks for coming in
on such short notice.

700
01:02:22,435 --> 01:02:23,519
Thanks for having me.

701
01:02:25,146 --> 01:02:25,980
All right.

702
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:28,066
I'm sorry about all the bother.

703
01:02:28,733 --> 01:02:31,110
It's just that everybody's
reading for this movie.

704
01:02:31,486 --> 01:02:32,987
No matter how big.

705
01:02:33,613 --> 01:02:35,198
It's just the way
this studio wants it.

706
01:02:35,657 --> 01:02:36,616
I hope you understand.

707
01:02:37,325 --> 01:02:39,702
No bother at all.
I'm happy to do it.

708
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:44,707
Great.
Okay, well... shall we just jump in?

709
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:45,750
Sure.

710
01:02:47,168 --> 01:02:49,295
- Uh, you need sides, or-
- Nope.

711
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:50,963
Ready to go.

712
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:53,341
Yeah? Okay.

713
01:02:53,966 --> 01:02:56,344
Um, you'll be reading with Linda.

714
01:02:57,178 --> 01:02:59,847
And, uh... let's begin.

715
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:07,105
Who are you?

716
01:03:09,357 --> 01:03:10,274
My name's Turner.

717
01:03:11,275 --> 01:03:12,443
Turner?

718
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:15,154
That's right.

719
01:03:18,408 --> 01:03:19,534
I'm here to help you.

720
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:21,160
Why?

721
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:23,413
Because I'm your father.

722
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:29,377
I'm here to help you.

723
01:03:30,795 --> 01:03:31,629
Why?

724
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:33,673
Because you're my daughter.

725
01:03:46,352 --> 01:03:48,563
My father?
You're not my father.

726
01:03:55,278 --> 01:03:56,404
I'm sorry.

727
01:03:57,447 --> 01:03:58,740
Could I get the sides actually?

728
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:01,784
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Of course, you can.

729
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:03,369
Here. Here you go, buddy.

730
01:04:04,245 --> 01:04:06,163
I'm so sorry, I had this down.

731
01:04:06,164 --> 01:04:07,123
I'm so sorry.

732
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:09,125
Take your time, it's totally fine.

733
01:04:09,834 --> 01:04:10,752
Thank you.

734
01:04:10,753 --> 01:04:12,044
Yeah, don't worry about it, Lee.

735
01:04:13,004 --> 01:04:16,799
You just...
Just take your time.

736
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,723
Listen to me,

737
01:04:24,557 --> 01:04:26,392
if we don't go now
we're as good as dead.

738
01:04:28,102 --> 01:04:29,145
But you're not my father.

739
01:04:30,062 --> 01:04:31,939
My father is dead.
He died a long time ago.

740
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:37,987
It's me.

741
01:04:39,864 --> 01:04:40,948
You don't even look like him.

742
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:42,867
I had to change the way I look.

743
01:04:44,035 --> 01:04:45,411
To protect you.

744
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:51,876
I did die.

745
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:07,433
I did die.

746
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:18,820
Shit.

747
01:05:19,654 --> 01:05:21,697
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh...

748
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:26,327
- I'm so sorry.
- No, Lee, it's okay.

749
01:05:27,245 --> 01:05:30,455
It's okay. Look, we'll go back.
Let's, let's go back.

750
01:05:30,456 --> 01:05:31,456
Let's go back to-

751
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:32,667
God damn it!

752
01:05:33,376 --> 01:05:34,210
I'm so sorry.

753
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:36,838
I apologize.
I wasted your time.

754
01:05:43,845 --> 01:05:45,429
Hey, hey.
Mr. Hayden.

755
01:05:46,264 --> 01:05:48,474
Lee Hayden.
How's it going, buddy?

756
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:49,642
Not now, man.

757
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:52,520
We all saw that video of your speech, man.
It was absolutely amazing.

758
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:54,856
Just happy, out of control.

759
01:05:55,356 --> 01:05:56,774
- Not now.
- Listen...

760
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:58,733
Are you here for another western?

761
01:05:58,734 --> 01:06:00,236
You're going to be
doing another western, aren't ya?

762
01:06:00,653 --> 01:06:02,280
It's gonna be great.
We'd love to see you on it.

763
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:03,489
How did the audition go?

764
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,198
Get the fuck out of my face!

765
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:06,908
Jesus Christ!
Relax, man.

766
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:07,910
Just get the fuck
away from me.

767
01:09:47,713 --> 01:09:49,799
Hi, this is Lucy. Leave a message.

768
01:10:34,426 --> 01:10:35,511
I had to do that act, Lee.

769
01:10:38,389 --> 01:10:41,308
I had to do it to try to make
sense of whatever this is.

770
01:10:44,728 --> 01:10:46,438
You know I don't actually
feel that way.

771
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:54,738
But you can't help who you like.

772
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:59,201
I'm feeling really sorry
that I hurt you because I didn't...

773
01:11:03,622 --> 01:11:04,582
I do like you.

774
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,043
So, I'm sorry.

775
01:11:11,839 --> 01:11:13,841
Nothing I said up there
changes how I feel about you.

776
01:11:29,565 --> 01:11:30,566
I'm dying.

777
01:11:34,778 --> 01:11:36,739
I got cancer
and I'm fucking dying.

778
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:02,973
Cancer's not
a death sentence anymore.

779
01:12:04,099 --> 01:12:05,100
Just so you know.

780
01:12:10,814 --> 01:12:13,525
Apparently, the one I have
is one of the worst you can hope for.

781
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:23,661
What does your oncologist say?

782
01:12:26,163 --> 01:12:27,498
Like surgery?

783
01:12:30,167 --> 01:12:32,461
Radiation, or chemo?

784
01:12:37,716 --> 01:12:39,093
Is it untreatable?

785
01:12:44,014 --> 01:12:45,224
There's a procedure.

786
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:50,062
Not a cure.

787
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:55,442
It can buy a few more years.

788
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:02,449
I just don't know if it's worth it.

789
01:13:07,955 --> 01:13:08,789
Worth it?

790
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:13,419
Buying time.

791
01:13:19,091 --> 01:13:22,011
Jesus Christ, Lee.
You're dying. It's all about buying time.

792
01:13:26,181 --> 01:13:27,308
Yeah.

793
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:32,980
I just haven't figured what I wanna do.

794
01:13:37,234 --> 01:13:38,736
What does your family say?

795
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:42,531
I haven't told my family.

796
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:46,285
Are you serious?

797
01:13:49,038 --> 01:13:50,331
I haven't told anyone.

798
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:53,500
Just you.

799
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:08,098
You need to tell your family.

800
01:14:12,519 --> 01:14:13,937
And you need
to get that procedure.

801
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:17,900
Okay?

802
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:23,572
Tell me you're gonna do it.

803
01:14:28,035 --> 01:14:28,869
I will.

804
01:14:32,456 --> 01:14:33,582
You need to promise me.

805
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:43,675
I promise.

806
01:14:50,307 --> 01:14:51,141
Okay.

807
01:15:02,236 --> 01:15:03,237
I almost forgot...

808
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:06,156
I got you something.

809
01:15:06,782 --> 01:15:07,991
You got me something?

810
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:09,451
Why?

811
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:11,995
It was the fucking reason
I came over here, man.

812
01:15:12,663 --> 01:15:13,497
My ruse.

813
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:21,922
I don't know what to say.

814
01:15:22,798 --> 01:15:23,715
Maybe "thanks."

815
01:15:25,342 --> 01:15:26,176
Open it.

816
01:15:42,985 --> 01:15:43,819
Thank you.

817
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:08,469
Hi, this is Lucy.
Leave a message.

818
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:11,972
Hey, Lucy, it's Lee.

819
01:16:12,473 --> 01:16:13,307
It's your dad.

820
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:16,143
Look, I know you're upset.

821
01:16:16,435 --> 01:16:18,020
And you have every right to be.

822
01:16:19,062 --> 01:16:20,189
I screwed up.

823
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:22,816
But I guess you're used to that.

824
01:16:25,903 --> 01:16:26,862
Listen...

825
01:16:29,031 --> 01:16:30,157
please call me back.

826
01:16:33,118 --> 01:16:35,537
I need to talk to you.
I have something I want to tell you.

827
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:16,495
These are very you.

828
01:17:18,121 --> 01:17:19,456
I'll take that as a compliment.

829
01:17:22,626 --> 01:17:23,710
Is Lucy here?

830
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:25,837
She was earlier.

831
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:29,883
Did she tell you what happened?

832
01:17:34,596 --> 01:17:35,806
I fucked up, Val.

833
01:17:42,813 --> 01:17:44,147
I've got something
I wanna tell you.

834
01:17:51,655 --> 01:17:54,283
I've... um...

835
01:19:04,645 --> 01:19:05,812
Hello?

836
01:19:23,205 --> 01:19:24,039
How sick are you?

837
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:27,793
I guess it's pretty bad.

838
01:19:35,926 --> 01:19:37,761
Were you ever gonna tell me?

839
01:19:41,223 --> 01:19:42,349
How long have you known?

840
01:19:55,904 --> 01:19:58,907
I don't know why
you go out of your way to be so difficult.

841
01:20:01,702 --> 01:20:06,206
You know that, right?
You know how selfish you can be?

842
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:10,961
You were always away.

843
01:20:14,047 --> 01:20:16,758
And even when you weren't
I was always very aware

844
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,844
that you were
in the process of leaving.

845
01:20:22,806 --> 01:20:23,932
And what are you doing now?

846
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:31,897
And the only reason we're even talking
is because you wanna die

847
01:20:31,898 --> 01:20:33,233
on good terms or something.

848
01:20:33,483 --> 01:20:34,817
Is there something wrong with that?

849
01:20:34,818 --> 01:20:36,862
You don't deserve it, Lee.

850
01:20:39,156 --> 01:20:42,534
You can't just decide to fix things.

851
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:47,247
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

852
01:20:48,957 --> 01:20:50,250
Just die and that's it?

853
01:20:50,751 --> 01:20:51,626
Over and done?

854
01:20:53,712 --> 01:20:54,629
Would you prefer that?

855
01:20:59,593 --> 01:21:01,428
I wanna get past this.

856
01:21:06,516 --> 01:21:08,435
I wanna get to the next thing.

857
01:21:14,357 --> 01:21:15,609
So, what is the next thing, Lee?

858
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:18,361
I don't know.

859
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:23,283
I just know there's
got to be another...

860
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:29,706
Will you just give me a chance?

861
01:21:33,794 --> 01:21:35,796
Give me a chance to write
another chapter.

862
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,974
I remember holding hands
with you on this beach.

863
01:21:52,604 --> 01:21:54,064
I held up our hands and I said,

864
01:21:56,566 --> 01:22:00,237
"Your hand is old, and it has wrinkles."

865
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,449
Then I turned
our hands over and I said,

866
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,410
"My hand is new and doesn't
have any wrinkles."

867
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:17,587
I thought you left because
I hurt your feelings.

868
01:22:26,096 --> 01:22:27,639
And I believed that for years.

869
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:35,647
I'm so sorry.

870
01:22:47,033 --> 01:22:48,451
It really is beautiful out here.

871
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:57,127
Yes, it is.

872
01:25:25,734 --> 01:25:27,067
Dr. Friedburg's office.

873
01:25:27,068 --> 01:25:28,445
I'd like to make an appointment.

874
01:25:28,903 --> 01:25:29,904
Please hold.

875
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:25,919
Thank you for holding.

876
01:26:26,252 --> 01:26:28,421
You said you'd like to make
an appointment, is that right?

877
01:26:31,299 --> 01:26:32,258
This is all you need?

878
01:26:32,259 --> 01:26:33,635
That's it.

879
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:38,556
Hey, I got the Ultimate
Buster Keaton on Blu-ray.

880
01:26:39,307 --> 01:26:40,350
Wanna stick around?

881
01:26:41,184 --> 01:26:43,353
We could order some
Chinese chicken salads.

882
01:26:44,562 --> 01:26:46,606
Yeah, I've got some stuff
I'm working on.

883
01:26:47,315 --> 01:26:48,233
Next time, though.

884
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,526
Yeah.

885
01:26:51,027 --> 01:26:52,028
How've you been feeling?

886
01:26:56,783 --> 01:26:58,159
Oh, I meant to tell you.

887
01:26:58,535 --> 01:27:02,579
I found some episodes of Cattle Drive
online last night.

888
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:03,831
I watched a bunch of them.

889
01:27:03,832 --> 01:27:04,874
How were they?

890
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:06,000
Amazing.

891
01:27:06,751 --> 01:27:08,002
You remember that scene we had?

892
01:27:09,003 --> 01:27:10,463
You catch me stealing a horse,

893
01:27:10,672 --> 01:27:12,215
and you're about to
beat the shit out of me,

894
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:15,301
and I tell you I'm an orphan,
and you take pity on me.

895
01:27:16,594 --> 01:27:19,430
Then in the next episode,
they fucking hang me,

896
01:27:19,973 --> 01:27:22,225
and that sends you on
a revenge killing spree.

897
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,271
My death was the whole
reason for that show, man.

898
01:27:43,788 --> 01:27:44,622
Hey there.

899
01:27:45,832 --> 01:27:46,666
Hey.

900
01:27:47,584 --> 01:27:48,459
How's it going?

901
01:27:52,005 --> 01:27:54,382
Happy birthday.

902
01:28:00,054 --> 01:28:00,889
I got you something.

903
01:28:02,515 --> 01:28:03,349
Hold on.

904
01:28:11,858 --> 01:28:12,984
Yeah.

905
01:28:14,611 --> 01:28:15,612
Did you ever read it?

906
01:28:16,696 --> 01:28:17,947
'Cause it was under the bed.

907
01:28:22,493 --> 01:28:23,912
You know, I used to
wanna be a poet.

908
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,709
Like, that was what I wanted to be more
than anything in the world.

909
01:28:32,212 --> 01:28:34,756
You sit down, because you're
gonna listen to this poem.

910
01:28:46,017 --> 01:28:49,479
"Dirge Without Music,"
by Edna St. Vincent Millay.

911
01:28:53,316 --> 01:28:55,944
"I am not resigned
to the shutting away

912
01:28:56,569 --> 01:28:58,279
"of loving hearts
in the hard ground.

913
01:29:00,698 --> 01:29:04,077
"So it is, and so it will be,
for so it has been,

914
01:29:04,661 --> 01:29:06,079
"time out of mind:

915
01:29:09,207 --> 01:29:10,416
"into the darkness they go,

916
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:13,294
"the wise and the lovely.

917
01:29:14,587 --> 01:29:16,589
"Crowned with lilies
and laurel they go;

918
01:29:18,174 --> 01:29:19,384
"but I am not resigned.

919
01:29:21,427 --> 01:29:23,805
"Lovers and thinkers,
into the earth with you.

920
01:29:24,097 --> 01:29:27,976
"Be one with the dull,
the indiscriminate dust.

921
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:33,773
"A fragment of what you felt,
of what you knew,

922
01:29:35,817 --> 01:29:39,778
"a formula, a phrase remains-
but the best is lost.

923
01:29:41,906 --> 01:29:44,993
"The answers quick and keen,
the honest look,

924
01:29:45,326 --> 01:29:47,662
"the laughter, the love-

925
01:29:49,163 --> 01:29:50,290
"They are gone.

926
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:53,209
"They are gone
to feed the roses.

927
01:29:54,627 --> 01:29:56,379
Elegant and curled
is the blossom.

928
01:29:57,213 --> 01:29:59,382
"Fragrant is the blossom.
I know.

929
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:01,217
"But I do not approve.

930
01:30:03,303 --> 01:30:06,597
"More precious was the light in your eyes
than all the roses in the world.

931
01:30:09,267 --> 01:30:12,395
"Down, down, down into
the darkness of the grave,

932
01:30:13,646 --> 01:30:18,526
"Gently they go, the beautiful,
the tender, the kind;

933
01:30:19,444 --> 01:30:22,280
"Quietly they go, the intelligent,

934
01:30:23,114 --> 01:30:24,657
"the witty, and the brave.

935
01:30:24,991 --> 01:30:26,034
"I know.

936
01:30:26,909 --> 01:30:30,621
But I do not approve.
And I am not resigned."

937
01:31:11,245 --> 01:31:15,124
The new sweet and spicy
Lonestar Barbecue sauce,

938
01:31:15,792 --> 01:31:18,419
the perfect partner for your ribs.

939
01:31:21,255 --> 01:31:25,009
The new sweet and spicy
Lonestar Barbecue sauce,

940
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:28,721
the perfect partner for your ribs.

941
01:31:30,681 --> 01:31:31,641
That was great, Lee.

942
01:31:33,309 --> 01:31:34,352
Can you do one more?
