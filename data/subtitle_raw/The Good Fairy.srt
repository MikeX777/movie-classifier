1
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:19,234
J with the hands we clap, clap, clap &

2
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,746
j with the foot we hop, hop, hop j

3
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,874
j once like that, once like this j

4
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,377
j whoops, there's a birdy kiss j'

5
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:34,042
once more, girls, and with
more life, more freedom.

6
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,675
Again.

7
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:39,088
J with the hands we clap, clap, clap &

8
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,304
j with the foot we hop, hop, hop j

9
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,389
j once like that, once like this j

10
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,556
j whoops, there's a birdy kiss jj

11
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,363
- This is this, of course?
- Oh, yes, sir.

12
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,150
- Good. Is the director in?
- Yes, sir.

13
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,410
Very good. And tell him
I'd like to see him please.

14
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,322
Yes, sir, but, uh, he's a lady.

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,831
Dr. Schultz.

16
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,958
Dr. Schultz is a lady?

17
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,210
- That's peculiar.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,712
Well, tell him I want to see her.

19
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,714
- I mean...
- Yes, ma'am.

20
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,259
There's a gentleman to see you,
Dr. Schultz.

21
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,769
Well, show him in.

22
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,851
There's nothing else we can do.

23
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,565
- Dr. Schultz?
- Yes?

24
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,163
- Schlapkonhl.
- I beg your pardon?

25
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,749
General director schlapkonhl.

26
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,334
Uh...

27
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,089
The dream palast.

28
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,796
The dream palast?

29
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,177
The dream palast,
it's got 3,000 seats.

30
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,383
- What for?
- To sit!

31
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,516
It's the largest motion picture theater
in Budapest.

32
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:53,056
Well, anyway, this morning at breakfast,
I was thinking aloud and I said to myself,

33
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,441
"schlapkohl, where can you get hold
of some nice, sweet usherettes?"

34
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,694
But sweet, mind you,
because I am sick and tired of these girls

35
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,106
who date up the customers
and give my place a bad name,

36
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,366
and what do you think?

37
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,995
- Well, I...
- Mrs. schlapkohl put down her coffee cup

38
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,496
and said, "Maurice,"
she calls me Maurice,

39
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,658
"why don't you try
the municipal orphanage?"

40
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,542
I see.

41
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,624
What is it you're looking for,
Mr. schlipkohl?

42
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,334
Schlapkohl. Usherettes!

43
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,169
To show the customers
to their seats.

44
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,800
They wear gorgeous uniforms,
I designed them myself.

45
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,838
A big hussar's hat,
a little cloak, and pants with...

46
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,756
- Pants?
- With stripes.

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:31,768
- Very effective.
- I dare say.

48
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,556
The... the pants, I mean,
they're not too tight?

49
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,522
That depends entirely on the girls,
the pants are all the same size.

50
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,731
I see.

51
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,648
And the bad fairy turned
into her own shape again

52
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,113
and started for the Princess
who was having sweet dreams

53
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,744
and sleeping like
the good little girl she was.

54
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,954
Then the bad fairy crept closer
and closer to the bed,

55
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,492
but the Princess didn't hear her.

56
00:04:55,545 --> 00:05:00,460
So she crept closer and closer,

57
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,626
and closer and closer.

58
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,670
Don't point that knife towards you,
Emma, you'll cut yourself.

59
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,841
And then, still closer.

60
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:15,604
And it certainly looked
as if she was in a pickle, a real pickle.

61
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,605
- And what do you suppose happened?
- What?

62
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,485
The prince stepped out from behind a tree and
started to climb the wall of the castle.

63
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,569
- What castle?
- The castle the bad fairy locked her up in, naturally.

64
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:29,155
And he climbed and he
climbed and he climbed,

65
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:33,664
and it was hard work
because the walls are smooth as glass.

66
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,701
It was glass, and just as he reached
the Princess's window,

67
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,248
the bad fairy jumped out
and turned him into a gizzard.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,791
- What's that?
- It's a kind of a bird.

69
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,757
- I never heard of that bird before.
- Well, you've heard of it now.

70
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:52,766
And there he was, just a little gizzard
hanging onto the side of the wall,

71
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:53,971
when what do you think?

72
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,183
The good fairy, who hadn't done
her good deed all day,

73
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,850
so you can imagine how badly she felt,
decided to come to his rescue.

74
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,769
But you said the good fairy
was on the other side of the world.

75
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,029
She was, but that didn't make
any difference to her.

76
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,030
She just summoned
her faithful broomstick

77
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,408
and, jumping into the saddle,
said the magic words.

78
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,320
"Wompa, wompa, wumpa, wumpa,
eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

79
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,240
Sweet and faithful rosalinda,
take me where I want to go."

80
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,409
And away she went!

81
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:25,048
And she flew faster and faster and faster

82
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,175
and faster and still higher!

83
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,134
Luisa!

84
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,514
- Luisa, come down from there at once.
- Yes, ma'am.

85
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,644
- Lu, are you all right?
- Oh, lu, are you hurt?

86
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,063
- Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt, dear?

87
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,232
Ooh. No, ma'am.

88
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,321
Then what were you doing up there?

89
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,702
I was telling fairy stories.

90
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,034
Well, next time, tell them from down here.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,698
- Yes, ma'am.
- Never mind that.

92
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,916
Now fix yourself, go in there and line up with
the other girls like nothing happened, dear.

93
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,956
These things are bound
to happen with children.

94
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,591
And now to find you some usherettes.

95
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,628
I suppose you'll need about a dozen.

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,467
Oh, no, I figure to start with just one.

97
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,507
- Just one?
- A sample.

98
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,303
Oh, oh, well, then the first one
must be very, very good.

99
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,813
Um, here's a nice, healthy girl.

100
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,473
Does she fill the requirements?

101
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,107
Yes, doesn't she?

102
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,018
Or that one?

103
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,983
Or this one?

104
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,398
They're all equally sweet.

105
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,909
- I see what you mean, doctor.
- These girls are very industrious.

106
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,040
Well, what's the matter
with the little acrobat here?

107
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,417
- Why, well, nothing.
- How do you do?

108
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,828
Would you like to be
an usherette, luisa?

109
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:49,124
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Do you know what an usherette is?

110
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,713
Uh, no, ma'am.

111
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,969
You see what I mean.
They know nothing.

112
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,129
Marvelous.

113
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:59,017
If I let you go into the outside world, dear,
would you still do your good deed each day?

114
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,472
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,310
Each day a goodly deed I place
to my account in heavenly grace.

116
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:10,195
A bank whose customers are blessed
with peace of heart for interest.

117
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,439
Very nice.

118
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,110
- She wouldn't flirt with the customers?
- Oh, she wouldn't know what it means.

119
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,902
I hardly know myself.

120
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,743
- All right, wrap her up.
- I beg your pardon?

121
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,407
Sold, I'll take her.

122
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,750
Oh, well, I'll send her to you first thing in the
morning, if you'll just step into my office.

123
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,966
Goodbye.

124
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,391
And you will try, always,
to be a credit to our institution.

125
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,936
- Yessum.
- And remember your debt to society.

126
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,856
It is the citizens of our state,
the people you meet on the street,

127
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,775
the simple taxpayers
who have supported you all these years.

128
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,240
- Yessum.
- They are the ones who have given you a home,

129
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,280
food to eat, and clothes to keep you warm.

130
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,664
- From my earliest infancy.
- That's right.

131
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,792
Try to repay this debt by doing good.

132
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,577
- Go out of your way to do it.
- I will.

133
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,495
And when someone asks you
to do something?

134
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,880
- Do it.
- Do it cheerfully.

135
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,211
- Do it with a smile.
- That's right.

136
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:19,678
I have now gone as far as time
and delicacy permit.

137
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,308
From what I have told you,
it should be clear

138
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,140
that a young girl going out
into the world alone

139
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,978
cannot be too careful
in her dealings with the male gender.

140
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,109
- Remember that.
- Yes, ma'am, I will.

141
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,395
Goodbye, my dear, and good luck.

142
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,858
Goodbye.

143
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,073
- Oh, goodbye, Dr. Schultz!
- Oh, be brave, luisa.

144
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,954
The time has come for you
to try your wings.

145
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,088
Left, left, left, left, right, left,

146
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,877
left, right, left.

147
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,846
Ho, ladies, please, keep in step.

148
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,557
Left, left, a, b, c, d.

149
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,392
Mark time, hup.

150
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,272
Right face, hup.

151
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,979
Forward march, hup.

152
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,268
Please!

153
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,357
Mark time.

154
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,862
Take stations.

155
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,318
Hup!

156
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,467
Um...

157
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,178
Are you talking to me?

158
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,640
- Oh, no, sir.
- Oh, I thought you said something.

159
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,645
Do that again, will you?

160
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,267
Very pretty.

161
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,059
Uh...

162
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,399
You're supposed to go this way.

163
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,563
- That way?
- Yes, sir.

164
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,277
Why?

165
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,157
- Why?
- Yes, why?

166
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,818
Well, I don't know, sir.

167
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,328
Then why do you do it?

168
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,613
Well, it's orders.

169
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,952
- You're trying to give me orders?
- Oh, no, sir.

170
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,209
'Cause I don't like being given orders.

171
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,336
I take orders all day in the restaurant,

172
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:18,000
and when it comes nighttime,
I like to be free, like the birds.

173
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,044
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

174
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,678
But make up your mind.

175
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,411
Oh, Meredith!

176
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,250
Surely you're not in earnest.

177
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,130
You speak in jest.

178
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,883
To cast us out this way is unthinkable.

179
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,136
He means nothing to me,
absolutely nothing.

180
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,968
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, sorry.

181
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,804
Merely the moon
and the madness of the moment.

182
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,389
I've made up my mind.

183
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,851
Does the memory of our love, then,
mean so little?

184
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,438
Oh, Meredith, have you forgotten
the troth we pledged?

185
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,023
The song we sang?

186
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,529
The promises we promised?

187
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,939
Go.

188
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,317
Go?

189
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,077
Oh, you don't mean that, Meredith!

190
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,785
You say it with your lips,
but your heart rebels, it must.

191
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,325
Consider that, Meredith.

192
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,415
Reflect upon the past,

193
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,046
and then, oh, my dear...

194
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,959
- Go.
- Oh, you don't mean go, Meredith.

195
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,423
- Reconsider.
- Go!

196
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,629
- Oh, Meredith.
- Go!

197
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,891
- Shh.
- You must listen to me.

198
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,554
- Go!
- You must have some pity!

199
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,848
If not on me...

200
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,438
At least on...

201
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,150
Surely he is innocent.

202
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,190
- Look, Meredith.
- Go.

203
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,030
- Meredith!
- Go!

204
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,035
Oh, but Meredith, listen to me!

205
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,914
- Let's go.
- But this isn't where we came in, papa.

206
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,496
This is where we go out
just the same, come on.

207
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,706
Meredith, Meredith, Meredith!

208
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,464
If you would only give me
a chance to explain.

209
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,170
Go.

210
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,710
- Go?
- Go.

211
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,884
Oh, but Meredith!

212
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,098
- Go.
- Oh, you don't mean that, Meredith.

213
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,480
- Go.
- Oh, Meredith!

214
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,186
Surely you're not in earnest.

215
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,813
- Go.
- Oh, you don't mean go, Meredith.

216
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,946
Go!

217
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,916
Ah, good evening.

218
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,956
- Hello, darling.
- Come on!

219
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:10,050
- Ah, looking for a gentleman, dimples?
- Yeah, do you know where I can find one?

220
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,265
Ah, good evening, little girl.

221
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,476
Oh, good evening, sir.

222
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,392
- Oh, uh, alone?
- Oh, yes.

223
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,733
Well, well, well, how about a sandwich
and a glass of beer?

224
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,147
- Well, uh...
- With music?

225
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,151
I don't think I'd like beer, thank you.

226
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,640
- Good night.
- Well, you could listen to the music, couldn't you?

227
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:37,156
I... I hate music,
and I think beer is terrible,

228
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,825
and sandwiches give me
a stomachache.

229
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,460
- Oh, they do, do they?
- Yes, they do, thank you.

230
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,734
- Please take your hand off my arm.
- Now listen, sister.

231
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,818
No, I don't want to listen.

232
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,154
- Please take your hand off Mel
- What's the matter with you?

233
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,009
- I'm married.
- Huh?

234
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,091
- Yes.
- Oh, you are, are you?

235
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,550
Well, where's your husband then?

236
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,467
Uh, he's sick in bed with a fever.

237
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,101
Oh, he is, is he?

238
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,309
No, he isn't either, there he is now!

239
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,098
Hello, darling.

240
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,607
Has your fever gone down?

241
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,110
- Huh?
- Yes, of course it has.

242
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,611
- Now, listen...
- Shh.

243
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,149
- What do you want to do, tear my coat?
- He's much better now!

244
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,067
- What the...
- It'll be all right.

245
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,113
If you'll just walk me up to the corner,
he won't bother me anymore.

246
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,871
Who, why?

247
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,999
There, it's all right now, thank you.

248
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,505
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

249
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,007
Well, don't you remember?

250
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,886
I'm the girl that pointed out the way
with the electric wand.

251
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,137
Oh, yeah, sure.

252
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,924
I didn't recognize you
without your pants.

253
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,559
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean as if, uh...

254
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,562
- What I meant was...
- That's all right.

255
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,815
Why did you come up
and talk to me so funny for?

256
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,854
Oh, well, you see, that man wanted me to go
and have beer and sandwiches with him.

257
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,899
I got scared, he wouldn't let me alone,
so I said you were my husband.

258
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,362
- Oh.
- Worked out very well.

259
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,403
I think it was a good idea, don't you?

260
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,994
Of course, it was a lie,
but not really a bad one.

261
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,705
I don't think so. Say, would you
like some beer and sandwiches?

262
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,962
- Oh, yes, with a face like yours.
- What's the matter with my face?

263
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,124
- I like it!
- Come on then!

264
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,169
- I know a place with music.
- Oh, I love music!

265
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,270
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

266
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,561
Very nice, in a cheap way.

267
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,481
- What?
- Well, I mean to say, look at this China.

268
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,740
Look at that glassware.
Look at this stuff.

269
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,321
You can hardly call it silver.

270
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,281
Oh, well, I was talking about the music.

271
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,322
You should hear the music at my hotel.

272
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,114
They wear tuxedoes.

273
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,750
Have you ever been to
the metropole supreme?

274
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,377
Oh, no, I've never been anywhere.

275
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,132
- Really?
- Except the asylum.

276
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,590
- Huh?
- Where I come from.

277
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,379
Oh.

278
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,721
The asylum, huh?

279
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,558
- Have you been out long?
- Just this morning.

280
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,727
Just this morning?

281
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,771
And how does it feel to be out?

282
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,565
- Oh, wonderful.
- It must be.

283
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,451
You're... cured, of course?

284
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,703
- Huh?
- I mean, you didn't run away or anything?

285
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,158
Oh, no, I didn't run away.

286
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,995
Some of the girls run away sometimes,
but they always bring them back.

287
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,626
- Good.
- Well, I don't blame them much for running away.

288
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,505
It isn't as much fun as you would think,
being an orphan.

289
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,256
Orphan asylum!

290
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,508
Why, naturally.

291
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,260
I'm glad to hear it.

292
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,342
For a minute, I, uh...

293
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,348
Here's your knife.

294
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,227
Never been anywhere,
never owned anything?

295
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,012
Oh, I went on an excursion once.

296
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,056
We gave them a garden party
at the penitentiary.

297
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,851
- That was a nice idea.
- Oh, yes, we liked it a lot.

298
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,566
But they didn't take us back because they
said it worried the prisoners or something.

299
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,573
- Uh-huh.
- We were going to play lawn games the next time too.

300
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,451
Lawn games?
Haven't you ever been to a real party?

301
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,058
- Well, that time at the penitentiary...
- Never mind the penitentiary.

302
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,825
I mean a party with regular people, where
you see beautiful dresses and tailcoats,

303
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,870
and wine, and plenty of good service
and glassware, and music.

304
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,665
- Oh, my.
- And ice cream and caviar and frog's legs.

305
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,049
Oh, I love ice cream.

306
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,131
Why, a girl like you should have
the best of everything.

307
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,592
Diamond bracelets, beautiful dresses,

308
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:25,806
nickel-plated automobiles,
caviar, lobsters, sable coats.

309
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:32,017
Say, would you like to go to a party
at my hotel and see all these things?

310
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,479
Oh, I do.

311
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,941
- Think I'd be all right?
- Tomorrow night.

312
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,231
Have you got an evening dress?

313
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,774
No.

314
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,365
Maybe I could borrow one from the prologue,
they use a beautiful one in the moon number.

315
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,824
Good, I'll get your ticket.

316
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,455
- Honestly?
- Come on out.

317
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,741
I'll leave it at the theater for you.
What's your name?

318
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,375
Luisa ginglebusher.

319
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,503
Ginglebusher?

320
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,257
Baron so-and-so,
shake hands with miss ginglebusher?

321
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,462
Never.

322
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,796
Well, I...

323
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,883
Don't mention your name to anybody,
just be aristocratic.

324
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,632
I'll try.

325
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,262
Now I'm gonna give you
a dancing lesson.

326
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,684
- Do you dance?
- I've been watching it long enough to know the theory.

327
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,912
Uh, your cloak, madam.

328
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,833
Why, certainly it's my cloak.

329
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,628
If you'd care to leave
it in the cloak room.

330
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,764
- We are so crowded inside.
- Yes.

331
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,248
Oh!

332
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,186
Hello, detlaff, I got in all right.

333
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,694
No, thank you.

334
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,915
Hello, detlaff!
You look so beautiful in your tailcoat.

335
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,955
- Shut up, pretend you don't know me.
- What?

336
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,590
Take one of these leftovers
and go and sit down somewhere.

337
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,672
- Oh, where shall I sit?
- At a table, naturally.

338
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,962
- Just sit down and mingle with the guests.
- All right.

339
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,006
And don't mention pringlegusher.

340
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,300
- Ginglebusher.
- Whatever it is.

341
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,720
- And don't be familiar with the waiters.
- No, I won't.

342
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,934
And don't let the waiters
be familiar with you.

343
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,848
I'll keep an eye on you.

344
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,879
Unhand me, varlet,
lest I cleave thee to the brisket.

345
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,216
Alone I will negotiate yon precipice.

346
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,655
Oh, hello!

347
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,956
Perfectly preposterous,
they put steps just where you can't see 'em

348
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,039
in a spot where everybody
is bound to fall over 'em.

349
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,578
What are they for, anyway?

350
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,459
Excuse me.

351
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,301
I just finished coming down a whole lot
over there with the greatest difficulty,

352
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,342
and here we are faced
with a whole lot more to go up.

353
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:21,230
You know, I believe these blasted architects
only do it just to complicate existence.

354
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,349
Ah, here.

355
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,315
Uh, won't you sit down here, madam?

356
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:31,357
- Are you sure it's all right?
- All right? It's marvelous!

357
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,573
- Thank you so much.
- Thank me? Thank you!

358
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,581
I've been having a perfectly rotten time,
and now we can enjoy it together.

359
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,457
I mean, a good time,
we'll have something.

360
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,244
- What would you...
- Would you please get up?

361
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,208
- Uh, get up?
- Yes.

362
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,124
But, uh, what, I thought you were alone.

363
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:51,544
- Well, I am alone.
- Well, in that case, if you're alone...

364
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,555
Oh, no, no, would you please rise up
and stay up?

365
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,763
But... I don't understand.
After all, I...

366
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:02,305
You know perfectly well that you're not supposed
to sit down with the guests and be familiar.

367
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,065
Familiar with the guests?
Well, what do you mean?

368
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,523
Huh, me? What do you...
Do I look like a waiter?

369
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,062
Well, yes.

370
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,278
Yes, well, I'll have you know, madam,
that far from being a waiter,

371
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:15,067
I... I'm not a waiter!

372
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,486
I'm anything but a waiter!

373
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,905
I've... good evening, your excellency.

374
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,164
There's the minister of
arts and decorations.

375
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,249
If I were a waiter, would I talk to him?

376
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,913
No, I guess you wouldn't.

377
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,083
There you are. A waiter...

378
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,921
Are you a minister too?

379
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,839
Well, no, not exactly,
although people often take me for one.

380
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,382
I'm... I'm in the meat business.

381
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,677
- Oh.
- Strictly wholesale, of course.

382
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,766
You don't look like a butcher.

383
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,023
A butcher? Who, me? I...

384
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,526
Well, I'm in the importer and exporter.

385
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,811
But of meat?

386
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,525
Well, why not?

387
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,656
Are you a vegetarian or something?

388
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:58,411
Oh, no, no, I think meat is very nice.

389
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,945
You're darn tootin', it is.

390
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,705
Obviously my meat is.

391
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,366
But why did we talk about me for, anyway?
Who brought it in?

392
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,285
Let's, uh, have some champagne.

393
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,670
The service in this place is terrible.

394
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,047
Uh, waiter.

395
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,583
Just bring us two champagnes, please.

396
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,297
Did you say two champagnes, sir?

397
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,429
Well, if I didn't say it, I ought to
have my head examined. What is this?

398
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,511
I thought perhaps the young lady
might prefer some soup, sir.

399
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,926
Oh, you did, did you?

400
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,560
Well, she wouldn't prefer some soup.

401
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,096
If she'd prefer some
soup, she'd ask for it.

402
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,436
It's very simple to say. "Soup, soup!"

403
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,774
Now bring us two champagnes
and don't argue with me, and then just go.

404
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,565
Very good, sir. Immediately, sir.

405
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,870
You better be firm with these fellows,
or they'll trample, trample, trample,

406
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,074
trample all over you.

407
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:46,083
The air is full of revolution
and... and... romance.

408
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,040
- Oh, there's your friend again.
- Huh? Oh...

409
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,421
Uh, good evening, your excellency.

410
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,926
Good evening.

411
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,257
I think you're wonderful.

412
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,218
- You do?
- I certainly do.

413
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,383
Of course, I haven't been around much,
and naturally,

414
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,269
just coming back from south America,
almost anything would...

415
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,976
But just the same, I
think you're marvelous!

416
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,890
You're different, you're terrific!

417
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,058
Oh, no, I'm not.

418
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,942
- Oh, yes, you are!
- No, I'm not!

419
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,230
Well, maybe you're not,
but, oh, yes, you are.

420
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,023
Greetings!

421
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,159
Welcome to our municipality!

422
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,365
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

423
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,157
- Oh, no.
- I am the minister of utilities, Dr. Metz.

424
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,666
How do you do, Dr. Metz?

425
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,123
What is your name again,
my little peach blossom?

426
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,083
Yes, and she's not your
little peach blossom!

427
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,668
I can't tell you that.

428
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,878
Oh, incognito.

429
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,793
Oh, no, that's not it.

430
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,507
You'll never guess it.

431
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,889
Very sharp, she reminds me of myself.

432
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,554
Oh, we're gonna have lots
of fun together, we three.

433
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,393
Yes, I can see that coming.

434
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,933
Now go get some champagne,
konrad, lots of it.

435
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,979
- Well, I say, you go and get it yourself.
- Birdy's thirsty, aren't you, my sweet?

436
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,774
Yes, oh, there's that dance
you promised me, come on.

437
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,661
- What dance? I didn't say anything about...
- Oh, yes, you did! Now, let's not waste the music.

438
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,117
Yeah, but how about me?
I want to dance with birdy myself.

439
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,531
Well, remember your.

440
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,604
It's all right, I'm very
much better dancer than...

441
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,710
Oh, no, no, no, but you
can have the next dance.

442
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,916
Come on, my dear, that's right, just...

443
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,127
You just try and keep off her feet.

444
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,312
Well, here we are!

445
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,730
Go right in.

446
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,819
Oh, isn't this pretty?

447
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,279
Yes.

448
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,034
What sort of a room did you say it is?

449
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,164
Oh, well, it's just a private dining room.

450
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,541
You know, you... you... there's...

451
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,997
What is your name?

452
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,163
I mean, I can't go on tripping over it
whenever I come to it.

453
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,457
Well, you can call me lu if you like.

454
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,842
Lu? Oh, Lulu!

455
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,549
Luisa, that's a beautiful name.

456
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,008
- You know something?
- Know what?

457
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,469
The secret of my success
has always been directness.

458
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,600
I mean, don't beat around the bush,
jump over it,

459
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,886
and the further you jump,
the quicker you get there.

460
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,645
- That's my motto.
- What does it mean?

461
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,435
Well, it means, if you look in my eyes
the way I look in yours,

462
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,820
or if I look in your eyes
the way you look in...

463
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,072
No, wait a minute.

464
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,780
If I look in my eyes the way you...

465
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,447
Oh, no, throw it away, it's no good.

466
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,956
Suppose that you were walking
through the woods one day,

467
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,618
and all of a sudden,
you met a wizard who stopped you and said,

468
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,081
"little girl, what do you want?

469
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,623
Because I'm terribly, terribly rich,
and I want to throw some of it your way."

470
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,086
What would you say?

471
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,172
- Oh, I don't know.
- Well, I mean...

472
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,463
Is this the story
of the enchanted woods?

473
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,973
Oh, uh, no, no, the enchanted bankroll!

474
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,225
Yeah!

475
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,932
Well, what would you...
Oh, excuse me.

476
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:56,018
I'm sorry. Well, come on, now,
what would you say to the wizard?

477
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,481
There must be plenty of things that a pretty
young girl like you would like to have.

478
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,485
Oh, I see what you mean.

479
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:07,117
Oh, I like pretty dresses, lobsters,
diamond bracelets, fur coats...

480
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,995
- Automobiles.
- Yes, oh, any old thing.

481
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,453
Yes, well, I see you've given
the matter some thought.

482
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,460
The poor wizard
has gotten himself into something.

483
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:21,215
Well, which of these little knickknacks
do you want?

484
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,047
- Oh, I don't want anything.
- But you just said...

485
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,632
No, we were playing a game!

486
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,468
What do you mean, you really...
For heaven's sake.

487
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,633
Well, you're stupendous!

488
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,474
I mean, all my life I've been looking
for just such a, uh...

489
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,232
Well, how would a nice fur coat be
to start with?

490
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,767
Would you accept it?

491
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,061
Why, naturally. What a funny question.

492
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,604
Well, there you are, you see!

493
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,363
You've practically got it on.

494
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:48,526
Now tell me, what kind of fur do you like?

495
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:52,070
Oh, I don't know, any old kind.

496
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,830
No, wait a minute.

497
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,081
Sable.

498
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,743
Eh, uh, oh, uh, sable.

499
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,831
Yes.

500
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,293
Yes, well, chinchilla
is even more expensive.

501
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,505
Oh, I wouldn't want anything expensive,
just something warm.

502
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,170
Oh, you just...
Yeah, like sable.

503
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,258
Yes.

504
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,173
Well, you are the most...

505
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,263
I mean, you... you
absolutely make me dizzy!

506
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,350
You electrify me, you fuse me!

507
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,811
You make me feel like 40!

508
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,145
I mean 20!

509
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,150
You put me back in short pants.

510
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,232
Now, look, let's play a little.

511
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,903
I mean, I'll be a mountain lion,
and you'll be a little lamb,

512
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,113
and you're over here
and you're eating grass,

513
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:35,782
and I'm hungry too,
and suddenly I swoop down on you!

514
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,994
Oh!

515
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,831
- And I sweep you off your feet...
- No, let me down.

516
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,496
And gallop you off
to my cave in the mountains!

517
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,837
Galumph, galumph, galumph, galumph...

518
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,095
You rang, sir?

519
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,552
- Oh, hello.
- Good evening, madam.

520
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,717
We... we were just playing a game.

521
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,852
So I perceive, madam.

522
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,637
Yes, well, what do you want?

523
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,806
I believe you rang for me, sir.

524
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:04,067
Yes, haven't I seen you before somewhere?
I never forget a face.

525
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,299
Very probable, sir,
I've been waiting around a long time.

526
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,176
I seem to connect you
with something unpleasant.

527
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,011
Thank you, sir.
Will there be anything else, sir?

528
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,492
Yes, there certainly will,
we're going to order supper.

529
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,825
Come, sit down.
I'm famished here.

530
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,455
Let me see, what, uh...

531
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,208
How's the, uh, how's the lobster soup?

532
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,743
- Terrible, sir.
- What?

533
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,664
If there's one thing our chef can't make,
it's lobster soup.

534
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,298
In strict confidence, sir,
he can't make any kind of soup.

535
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,005
Well, thank you for warning me.

536
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,215
Well, how's the... how's
the fillet of sole?

537
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,129
- Fillet of sole, sir?
- Yes, yes!

538
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,468
- Vile, sir.
- Vile?

539
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,598
I couldn't recommend it.

540
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,556
We're so far from the channel,
you know, so it has to be packed in ice.

541
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,096
I suspect that the ice gave out
about halfway, sir.

542
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,855
What, you don't mean that it's...

543
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,311
Oh, it's terrible.

544
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,601
Unfortunately, sir.

545
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,987
Well, is there anything the matter
with the noisette of lamb?

546
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,147
Very leathery, sir.

547
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,691
What is leathery?
How can lamb be leathery?

548
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,655
- I suspect it's goat, sir.
- Goat?

549
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,989
But this is ridiculous!

550
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,279
I never... everything...

551
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,914
Nothing is first class about this hotel
except the price!

552
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,077
Exactly, sir, just what I've always said.

553
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,419
Oh, maybe I'm not as hungry as I thought.

554
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:11,460
Nonsense! It's just because this individual
presents everything so badly!

555
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,925
Well, is there anything here
that you can suggest?

556
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,590
We have a very fine breast
of Guinea hen, sir, in aspic,

557
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,554
with paté de foie gras and truffles.

558
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,470
- Oh, my.
- Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?

559
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,356
- You didn't ask me, sir.
- I didn't ask, I'm not supposed to!

560
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,711
You're the one, if there's any...

561
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,521
Oh, go get us two orders of that,

562
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,029
and bring me a bottle of pommery 1911
and a... bombe surprise.

563
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,985
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- What's the matter now?

564
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,865
The Guinea hen is aspic
is a special, sir.

565
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,072
It's served only in the cold buffet
in the ballroom!

566
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,908
In the ball... but this is outrageous!

567
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,166
- I've never heard of such a thing!
- I agree with you in every way, sir.

568
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,702
Why don't we have supper
in the ballroom?

569
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,871
Because I want to eat right here!

570
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,630
Any particular reason, sir?

571
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,837
No. No! No particular reason.

572
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,423
What is this? It's ridiculous.

573
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,950
Everything that I want to order
is either served in the ballroom

574
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,635
or it's been out in the sun too long.

575
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,844
We are only a féte, sir.

576
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,885
I could get you a splendid table
in the ballroom!

577
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,770
I'm going to eat right here
if it's the last thing I do in my life!

578
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,227
Now you go and get me some eggs!

579
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,562
- I'll see if we have any, sir.
- What?!

580
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,568
You may depend upon it, sir.

581
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:12,195
Eggs!

582
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,578
Yes, did you notice that fellow's eyes?

583
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,364
They're like angry marbles.

584
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,953
No, I didn't notice.

585
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,208
I think he's crazy.

586
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:30,338
Bar none, free-for-all, any style,
this is the worst hotel in the whole world!

587
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,546
Let's see, where were we
before that... that came in?

588
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,426
Uh, oh, yes, I remember.

589
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,758
I was a mountain goat, uh...

590
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,967
Goat. Lion!

591
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,680
And... and I was carrying you off
to my cave in the mountain!

592
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,014
No, leave me alone!

593
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,851
- But it's only a game.
- I don't like it.

594
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,984
- But we were having... listen...
- Oh, please, he doesn't want me to.

595
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,941
A little while ago, we were
having such fun, and you were...

596
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,198
- What's the matter now?
- I'm married.

597
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,529
You're married?

598
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,695
Yes, he's got a fever tonight.

599
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,457
- Oh, he has?
- He certainly has.

600
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,493
Well, this is terrible!

601
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:11,755
Just when I've made up my mind I was going
to deck you out like a Christmas tree.

602
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,085
This is te...

603
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,169
What did you...

604
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:17,177
- There are no eggs, sir.
- What? Well, who asked you for...

605
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,009
Oh, go away, who asked you?
We're not hungry anyway.

606
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,870
- I believe the young lady is famished, sir.
- Well, get her something to eat then!

607
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,727
- What shall I bring, sir?
- Well, bring her some tapioca pudding

608
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,104
and an order of fried fish
and a plate of noodle soup!

609
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,435
- Sir.
- Yes, and some soft-boiled goose eggs,

610
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,771
and a case of champagne
and three glasses of milk

611
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,937
and a bucket of beer,
and get out of here!

612
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,400
Yes, sir.

613
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,815
What are you doing with your hand
up in the air like that?

614
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,235
Just nervousness, sir.
Thank you, sir.

615
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,870
He's crazy as a quilt!

616
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,031
I'll have him locked up
in the morning, I'll...

617
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,120
Oh, yes, you're married.

618
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,081
What did you want to go and do that for
and spoil everything?

619
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,089
- Because I was frightened.
- Yes, I know, but... what?

620
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,967
Well, of all the silly reasons,
that takes the feather duster.

621
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,502
Because you were frightened.

622
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,547
And you'd look so gorgeous
in minks and links and...

623
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,680
Oh, pitiful.

624
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,433
Just when I meet somebody
that sweeps me off my feet,

625
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,719
somebody I want to flitter away
my millions on.

626
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,559
Don't you understand,
all my life I've wanted to be extravagant.

627
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,190
- I have too.
- Well, there you are.

628
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,648
I've never seen a silly little anything
that I haven't wanted to buy.

629
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,777
Me too.

630
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,779
Just...

631
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,065
Hold it!

632
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,074
- What?
- Don't move!

633
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,031
I've got it! It's diabolical,

634
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,822
and at the same time,
it's as simple as "how do you do?"

635
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,957
He'll buy you the fur coat, huh?

636
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,664
- Who?
- Your husband, I'll make him rich!

637
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,204
It's marvelous, I thrive on obstacles.

638
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,236
- The reason for my great success has always been...
- No, you can't do that!

639
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,002
Who can't do what?
I can do anything, you hardly know me.

640
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,888
With the snap of my fingers,
I make a man rich, I tear him down,

641
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,422
I build him up just like that.

642
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,307
Yeah, but I don't want you to.

643
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,594
Oh, you... you don't understand.

644
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,762
Besides, you can't.

645
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,351
Don't use that word, it irritates me.

646
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,850
- All my plans are foolproof.
- You're gonna make me cry.

647
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:59,363
Well, why do you want to cry
when you can do a good deed for somebody?

648
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,615
Here... here's a man
who has been supporting you and... and...

649
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,824
- That's right.
- Certainly it's right, and I suppose he isn't rich

650
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,535
or you'd have something,
I mean, it's marvelous!

651
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,576
It's good for you and good for him
and makes me feel better,

652
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,496
and at the same time,
it's very funny.

653
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,880
Yes, it's funny all right.

654
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,087
Will you really make him rich?

655
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,798
Oh, well, how rich do you mean?

656
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,383
Just ordinary rich.

657
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,344
Oh, just ordinary.
Well, I certainly would!

658
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,225
That means no more to me than...

659
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,726
What are you laughing at?

660
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,514
I was just thinking,
am I making somebody rich?

661
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,182
- You making somebody rich?
- Like the good fairy.

662
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,942
Just one wave of the wand.

663
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,852
Yeah, one wave of the checkbook.

664
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,943
Now tell me, what does he do?

665
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,232
Oh...

666
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,696
What... what does he do?

667
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,704
Yes, certainly, what does he do?

668
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:56,040
When I say, "what does he do?" I don't mean
what size hat does he wear or something.

669
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,001
You want to know what... what he does?

670
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,540
Well, for the love of...

671
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,926
Do you think that I just like to hear my...
I mean, like a canary bird or something?

672
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,428
What does he do?

673
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,634
Oh, my husband.

674
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,926
Oh, now we're right back
where we started from.

675
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,766
Certainly, your husband,
what does he...

676
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,305
I never asked him.

677
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,314
Oh, you never asked him, I see.

678
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,191
"What does he do? I never asked him."

679
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,728
Perhaps I don't make myself
as clear as I...

680
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,273
When I say, "what does he do?" I mean,
is he a butcher or a horse doctor

681
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,739
or a dentist or an undertaker or what?

682
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,995
What would you like him to be?

683
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,701
What would I like him to be?

684
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,914
Whatever I'd like him to be,
I mean, he could just be?

685
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,498
He's very willing.

686
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,128
Well, that always sounds bad.

687
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,540
I suppose he's a deep
sea diver or something.

688
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,754
That would give me a lot of trouble.

689
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,637
Why couldn't you have married
a lawyer or... or maybe...

690
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,049
- A lawyer?
- Yes, certainly, a lawyer, or even...

691
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,763
He is a lawyer!

692
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,855
Well, why didn't you say that
in the first place?

693
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,688
Well, I was afraid,
maybe you didn't need one.

694
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,444
Well, I'll see him in the morning
and I'll make him...

695
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,072
I'll... I'll... I'll do anything for you.

696
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,405
I'll make him
general European legal representative.

697
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,035
Oh.

698
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,365
What does it mean?

699
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:15,452
Well, it doesn't mean anything,
but I'll make him something.

700
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,494
Now, what's his name?

701
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,411
Oh, his name.

702
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,080
Yes, certainly, his name.

703
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,419
Do you have to know his name?

704
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,881
Do I have to know his name?

705
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,922
Luisa, really, sometimes,
I mean, after all, you're...

706
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,215
Do I have to know his name?

707
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,260
- Oh, his name.
- Yes, certainly, his name!

708
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,770
- I mean, after all, it isn't as if...
- Birdy!

709
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,397
Oh, no.

710
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,605
Birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy,
birdy, birdy, birdy, birdy.

711
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:46,021
Here, what are you doing? Stop that!
Now you just go on home.

712
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,156
Oh, yes, Dr. Metz.

713
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:52,570
J we'll meet beyond the grave,
fare thee well, parlez vous j

714
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,331
j we'll meet beyond the grave,
parlez vous, fare thee well j

715
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:00,981
what's the matter with you? Don't you know
enough to keep out of a private dining room?

716
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,275
Didn't I tell you to get out?
Haven't you any sense at all?

717
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:07,042
Here I've been signaling you all evening!
You must be from the deaf and dumb asylum!

718
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,883
Lace, ladders, ladies tailors,
lanolin, lapidaries...

719
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:13,285
What are you looking in the phone book for?
You don't know anybody.

720
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,265
I hope he's poor,
he's got to be poor.

721
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,303
Laundries, laundries, laundries,
more laundries.

722
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,517
- Lawyers!
- What do you want a lawyer for?

723
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,684
Oh, there are so many of them, if I could
just find one who really needs it.

724
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,146
Hold this book.

725
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,936
- Wompa, wompa, wumpa, wumpa...
- What?

726
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,301
- Shh, magic. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
- What's the matter with you?

727
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,112
Sweet and faithful rosalinda,
take me where I want to go.

728
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,196
- There he is.
- Who?

729
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,487
- My husband!
- Your husband? You've been drinking.

730
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,623
Dr. Max sporum.
Oh, he's got to be poor.

731
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,705
- Poor?
- Is weisenberger street a poor street?

732
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,649
Certainly it's a poor street,
my cousin lives there.

733
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:46,193
- Are you sure it's poor, really poor?
- I tell you, my cousin lives there.

734
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,458
Oh, that's marvelous!
Rosalinda really helped.

735
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,111
What's marvelous?
It's a terrible street.

736
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,699
Who's rosalinda?
What are you talking about?

737
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,701
What do you mean your husband?
You haven't got a husband.

738
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,465
- You're going home!
- Oh, I won't go home.

739
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,496
- You don't even know what's happening.
- You're going home right away

740
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,331
or I'll tell him who you are
and how you got here.

741
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:02,167
Oh, detlaff, you wouldn't do that. Oh, no, you
wouldn't really play a trick like that on me,

742
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,476
not if you knew what's happened.

743
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,767
- Did something happen?
- Yes!

744
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,356
I'll tear him to pieces.

745
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,941
I'll knock him down and pick him up

746
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,135
and then knock him down again
and then pick him up again...

747
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,637
- No, it hasn't happened yet, it's going to happen!
- Oh, it is, is it?

748
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,890
The only thing that's gonna happen to him
is a terrible accident!

749
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,121
- I'll seize him by the throat!
- No, no, no, detlaff.

750
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,531
No, no, no, no, detlaff.

751
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,896
Just give me two minutes to tell him
his name and then I'll go home.

752
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,831
I promise I will, detlaff,
just two minutes.

753
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,745
Alone at last!

754
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,754
I've... what are you doing here?

755
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,882
What is this, a waiter's
waiting room or something?

756
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,509
Here, where's the supper I ordered?

757
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,260
It'll be outside, sir, in two minutes.

758
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,592
- Outside?
- Qutside in two minutes.

759
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,348
Thank you, sir. Very good, sir.

760
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,100
In two minutes, outside!

761
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,853
Well, he's crazy as a chipmunk!

762
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,210
What does he mean, two minutes?
We've been waiting two hours now...

763
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,440
- Mr. konrad?
- What?

764
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,728
His name is Dr. Max sporum,
104 weisenberger street.

765
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,443
Uh, his name is...
I don't need a doctor!

766
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,232
- Oh, you mean...
- He's my husband.

767
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,822
My husband, oh, of course.
Dr. Max...

768
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,827
Sporum, s-p... r-u-m.

769
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,239
- Sporum.
- It's 104 weisenberger street.

770
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,704
104 weis...
Is he in the phone book?

771
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,085
Oh, yes, he's in the phone book.

772
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,088
Oh, that's fine! Sporum, I'll see him
the first thing in the morning.

773
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,419
Yes, well, I... I've got to go now.

774
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,198
Oh, but you can't, we have...
Good heaven, we haven't had our soup yet.

775
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,533
I know, but if I don't go now,
something terrible might happen.

776
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,718
Oh, but I wanted to have supper with you.

777
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,412
Some other time, I'll come any other time.

778
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,973
- Tomorrow night then?
- Yes, tomorrow night, but not now.

779
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,687
Oh, is he that jealous?

780
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,394
Who? Oh, yes, he's terribly jealous.

781
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,354
He just goes simply wild.

782
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,614
I will, Mr. konrad, good night.

783
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,501
Oh, detlaff, I'm so grateful to you, this has
been the most wonderful evening in my whole life.

784
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,565
Not for me it hasn't,
I've never spent such an evening.

785
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,171
This is positively the last time
that I play nursemaid!

786
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,129
If I ever do anything like this again,
you can call me a dishwasher!

787
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,169
- Look, detlaff!
- Huh?

788
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,214
Look.

789
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,306
Somewhere out there, just think,
somewhere out there in the night,

790
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,813
maybe one of those twinkling lights,
maybe one of those darked windows,

791
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,020
little Max is sleeping gently.

792
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,310
- Little who?
- He's worried about his rent

793
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,649
or how he's going to eat tomorrow
or something like that,

794
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,236
and he doesn't know, detlaff,
just think, he doesn't know!

795
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:20,277
- Doesn't know what?
- That I'm watching over him while he sleeps,

796
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,570
that I'm taking care of him,

797
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,955
that I'm his good fairy.

798
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,444
What is it?

799
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,826
I'm looking for Dr. Max sporum.

800
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:03,953
Well, he isn't here.
Are you from the gas company?

801
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,410
No, I'm from the south American
meat packing company.

802
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,246
I hate frozen meat,
I wouldn't touch it. Good day.

803
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,785
Woof, I...

804
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,130
- How many times do I have to tell you?
- Do I look like a meat salesman?

805
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,135
- Yes.
- Well, I'll have you know, sir,

806
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:22,547
that I happen to be president
and the principal stockholder

807
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,309
of a very large organization,
the south American meat packing company.

808
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,596
- I still don't want any of your meat.
- But I'm not here about meat!

809
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,516
I'm looking for Dr. Max sporum,
a lawyer at this address.

810
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:37,028
I want some legal advice, and my first
advice to him will be to discharge you.

811
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:38,654
- Oh, it will, will it?
- Yes, it will!

812
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,441
Then let me tell you, my pompous friend,
that nobody can discharge me

813
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,075
because I am Dr. sporum.

814
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,361
You?

815
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,123
Well, no wonder.

816
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,704
No wonder what?

817
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,745
Well, just no wonder.

818
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,255
You're Dr. sporum?

819
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,882
Well, you deserve to
have me walk out on you.

820
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,795
Still, let's go into your office.

821
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,214
- Have you an office?
- Certainly I have an office.

822
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,724
Where do you suppose I see my clients,
in the bathroom?

823
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,430
I shouldn't be surprised.

824
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,095
Mind you, I still don't want any meat.
=...

825
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,014
- A seat?
- Yeah.

826
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,359
Dr. sporum, you don't know me,

827
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,522
but one of the reasons
for my great success

828
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:24,534
is that once I set my mind to something,
I'm unalterable, I carry it through.

829
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,695
Are you gonna tell me
the story of your life?

830
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,953
No, sir, I am not.

831
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,456
I am merely trying to tell you why,
in spite of everything,

832
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,243
I wish to appoint you
general European legal representative

833
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:36,333
of the south American
meat packing corporation.

834
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,044
Now, what do you think of that?

835
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,084
I'm not a child, you know.

836
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,469
No, nobody could mistake you for one.

837
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,301
I didn't pass first in my class
at law school with highest honors

838
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,636
and special mention from the regent
for nothing, you know.

839
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,177
Are you going to tell me
the story of your life?

840
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,186
No, sir, I am not.

841
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,440
I am merely telling you that it is useless
to try to pull the wool over my eyes.

842
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,851
- But I'm not...
- Your subterfuges are childish.

843
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,271
I see through you like a pane of glass.

844
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,940
Oh, uh, you do?

845
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,754
Well, you couldn't... it's pitiful,
you couldn't see through anything.

846
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,779
Much further than you think,
my fine friend.

847
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:16,628
Now, you want us to believe

848
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:20,130
that you, as head of a large corporation,
have chosen me, an unknown lawyer,

849
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,417
to be general European
legal representative?

850
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,428
- Well, I... you see, doctor...
- Answer yes or no.

851
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,838
Well... yes.

852
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,633
Then, without seeing your plan completely,

853
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,269
I see enough to smell a rat, and I will
have nothing to do with shady deals.

854
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:37,398
- What are you...
- I uphold a standard of ethics.

855
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,525
You've come to the wrong place, sir.
Good day.

856
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,152
But I have not!
That's just why I'm here!

857
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:46,407
I'm looking for an honest man.
If possible, with brains.

858
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,363
Where did you ever hear of me?

859
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:53,156
Oh, now, come, doctor, you're not so obscure
as you modestly pretend to believe.

860
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:57,498
Oh, no, your name has been going
the rounds now for quite some time.

861
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,457
Where did you ever hear of me?

862
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,418
Well, I... a friend.

863
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,549
Ve - onl ry highly placed.

864
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:08,213
- Who?
- Uh... Dr. Metz at the ministry.

865
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,763
- Dr. Metz?
- Uh, yes.

866
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,770
- Himself?
- Yes, in person!

867
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,056
Probably at the time
of one of your cases.

868
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,940
What... the bugani case?

869
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:25,276
Yes, of course, that's it,
the, uh, the good old garani case.

870
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,566
I always wanted to congratulate you
on winning it.

871
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,984
But I lost it.

872
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:33,404
Oh, you lost...
But of course, that's it!

873
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,699
But so cleverly,
so very cleverly, doctor.

874
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,791
Sometimes it's better to lose a case
cleverly than to win it stupidly.

875
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,421
That's what we admired.

876
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:47,927
I remember Dr. Metz saying to me,
keep your eye on, uh, sp... sporum.

877
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,554
I did, I'm here.

878
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,839
That's right.

879
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,850
Yeah, well, congratulations.

880
00:46:54,895 --> 00:47:02,358
You are now general European legal representative
of the south American meat packing company, ltd.

881
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,768
- Limited?
- Yes.

882
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,814
Your fees should total
between 100,000 and 120,000 a year.

883
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,949
- Uh...
- Minimum.

884
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,781
120,000?

885
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,492
Yes, well, in that general neighborhood.

886
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,327
And now, I'm a man of action.

887
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,493
Here, here are the contracts.

888
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,585
Just, uh, sign where you
see the pencil Mark.

889
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,755
I believe we'll be able
to keep you busy, doctor.

890
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,465
L, uh, I...

891
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:35,599
I might even send you on a tour
of the, uh, company's branches

892
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,182
for the purpose of getting acquainted.

893
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,222
Yeah, in fact, I will send you.

894
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,266
You, uh, you could get a little car,

895
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:47,608
and, uh, while we're on that subject, uh,

896
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,819
forgive my mentioning it,
but I, uh, I should like things

897
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,031
a little, uh, neater, more modern.

898
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,164
I mean, some new office equipment
and everything like that to start with.

899
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,666
New office equipment to start with?

900
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:04,249
Yes, yes, naturally, later,
you'll have a bigger office

901
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,256
and a staff of clerks
and that sort of thing,

902
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:11,544
but for the moment, I mean,
I... I permit myself to, uh,

903
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:17,888
to suggest that perhaps a new apartment
and, uh, some nice, uh,

904
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:24,934
dresses and furs and things
for any... dependent that you may have.

905
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:29,403
- 100,000 a year?
- Yes, yes, yes.

906
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:33,737
Oh, and here, here are
10,000 kronen in advance

907
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:37,324
as a token of good faith
to bind the contract.

908
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,204
Yes.

909
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,990
Yeah, they're good.

910
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:47,585
Remember, doctor, share your good fortune with,
uh, with anyone, uh, near and dear to you.

911
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:51,467
It, uh, it means so much to them,
I mean, a little mink coat here

912
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,503
and a little diamond bracelet there.

913
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:57,014
They love it, and it'll be so easy for you.

914
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,970
Yes, so very easy!

915
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,523
And remember, doctor,
you can't do it too fast to suit me.

916
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,613
My motto is, the sooner the... quicker.

917
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,574
And [I'll telephone you
later in the day, huh?

918
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,577
Oh, hello!

919
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,833
Well, shh, good morning.

920
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,744
- You've seen him?
- Oh, yes.

921
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,662
Oh, what's he like?

922
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,252
Oh, he, uh... huh?

923
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,337
I mean, what was he like with you?

924
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,671
Oh, very funny.

925
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:36,633
Come, have breakfast with me
and I'll tell you all about it.

926
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,594
No, no, I really think I'd better...

927
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,508
Oh, well, I guess it's too late now.

928
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,018
Oh, yes, much too late.

929
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,724
Come, we'll sneak away, huh?

930
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,264
Well, you see, I...

931
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:49,604
You're marvelous!

932
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,235
A little neater perhaps.

933
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,897
Office equipment.

934
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,236
I'm going to buy office equipment!

935
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,286
I'm going to buy office equipment.

936
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,197
Office equipment!

937
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,992
And have a large staff!

938
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,752
Mink coats.

939
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:13,040
Mink coats and diamond bracelets?
What's he take me for?

940
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,711
I'm going to buy a pencil sharpener
with a handle and different sized holes!

941
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,049
At last!

942
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:26,479
Talking out loud in an
empty room like a radio.

943
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,731
I wonder if I'm crazy.

944
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,268
I don't feel crazy.

945
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,369
Office equipment.

946
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:51,754
You know, now that I've met him,
everything is clear to me.

947
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:55,087
- Tis?
- Oh, very clear, you poor child.

948
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:59,595
I don't see how you stand it,
I mean, it'd annoy me to death.

949
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,631
I mean, doesn't it tickle?

950
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:09,105
Oh, forgive my vulgarity, I mean,
I shouldn't tread on personal...

951
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,107
- Doesn't what tickle?
- Well, I mean, the beard.

952
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,985
I thought I'd die
when he stuck his head out.

953
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,818
If there's anything that backs me down,
it's a beard.

954
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,358
He looks like my uncle.

955
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,948
Oh!

956
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,033
The... beard?

957
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,538
Oh.

958
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,121
Huh?

959
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,913
You certainly picked a good one
when you picked him.

960
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,206
Didn't 1?

961
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,875
I should say you did.

962
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,011
How old is he?

963
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,297
Oh, um,

964
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,306
how old would you say he is?

965
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,013
Oh, I don't know, I mean,

966
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,145
you can't tell on account of the foliage.

967
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,227
Oh, a couple of years older than me.

968
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,939
Oh, he can't be that old!

969
00:51:55,988 --> 00:52:00,357
Well, he does... that doesn't...
It doesn't make him decrepit.

970
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,526
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean...

971
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,992
- Well...
- Well, I've always thought of him as young.

972
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,781
Oh, you have?

973
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:12,167
Well, you've got some imagination.

974
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:15,955
Yes, well, I've got to
go see what he's like.

975
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,125
I don't want him to do anything foolish
and spoil everything.

976
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,169
Oh, yes, certainly, I...

977
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,631
What?

978
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,674
I mean, now that you've made him a...
General.

979
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,514
European legal rep...
Oh, yes, yes, I see.

980
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,099
I mean, sudden money.

981
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,764
I mean, you're quite right, it might...

982
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:38,231
I don't think he's, uh, very bright anyway.

983
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,362
Yes, he might say the wrong thing.

984
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,648
Yeah, he might, he does, he always says it.

985
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,659
Every time he opens his mouth,
he puts his foot in it.

986
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,945
Yes, I'd better go talk to him.

987
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,863
Yeah, well, tonight at 11.

988
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:52,533
Yes. You're sure now you didn't mention me?

989
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,122
Oh, of course not.

990
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,162
- And you know something funny?
- What?

991
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,422
He didn't mention you either.

992
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,755
Yes, that's... that's funny, all right.

993
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,046
- It's marvelous!
- Yeah.

994
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,279
Uh, are you Dr. Max sporum?

995
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,323
No, upstairs.

996
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,734
Sign here please.

997
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,772
- What?
- Oh, come on, lady, I'm in a hurry.

998
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,816
- Thanks.
- Look out.

999
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,408
- Say, give me a hand with the couch.
- Sure.

1000
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,031
Excuse me.

1001
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,262
Oh!

1002
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,354
- Oh...
- There it is.

1003
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,568
I was afraid they'd forgotten to send it.
Thank you.

1004
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,325
You don't know how much this means to me.

1005
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:55,615
Have you ever wanted something all your
life, and then suddenly, it arrived?

1006
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,328
This was my great ambition.

1007
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,789
It's beautiful. Are you
sure it's a good one?

1008
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,044
No.

1009
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,420
Then why did you bring it?

1010
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,503
Suppose this instrument doesn't perform
the way it's intended to, what then?

1011
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,713
Well, you could sharpen them
with a kitchen knife.

1012
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:10,926
And waste my time
which happens to be very valuable?

1013
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:15,622
I don't want to sound severe, but if you paid
a little more attention to pencil sharpeners

1014
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:19,264
and a little less to... to...
Whatever you think about,

1015
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,773
you might not have to work
in a stationery shop all your life.

1016
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,684
But I don't work in a stationery shop.

1017
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:24,817
I see.

1018
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,774
That is, I... I don't see.

1019
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,030
Didn't you just bring this?

1020
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:30,111
- No.
- But I just took it out of your hands.

1021
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,526
- Somebody pushed it at me.
- I see, I see.

1022
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,446
Let's try it anyway.
Will you take hold of the foot?

1023
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,536
Oh!

1024
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,625
So smooth.

1025
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,041
It must have ball bearings.

1026
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,005
Glorious!

1027
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,421
Like a needle, feel.

1028
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,681
Did you ever see such a point?

1029
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,809
I'm sorry I had to scold you just now,
but it was for your own good.

1030
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,187
Let's sharpen another.

1031
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,314
Are you always so nasty to everybody?

1032
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,566
See, these other holes
are for the smaller ones.

1033
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,771
It takes all sizes.

1034
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,311
Who, me?

1035
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,606
That's right, you're... you're not
from the stationery shop, are you?

1036
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:11,739
No.

1037
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,992
Look, when it's full, you do like this.

1038
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,904
You press that down, you take that out,

1039
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:20,370
drop them out, and there you...

1040
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:22,751
Oh, I am so sorry.

1041
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,912
Were you looking for me?

1042
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,957
I'm... I'm slightly excited today,
as who wouldn't be.

1043
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,376
Are you Dr. Max sporum?

1044
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,420
Yes, and whom have I the honor?

1045
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,713
Oh, my name is luisa...

1046
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,098
- Luisa?
- Ginglebusher.

1047
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:40,853
How do you do? Gingle-what?

1048
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,559
- Busher.
- Ah, yes.

1049
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:46,226
- And you wanted to see me about?
- I just wanted to see what you looked like.

1050
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,519
Uh-huh, and how do I look?

1051
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,030
Terrible.

1052
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,320
Really?

1053
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,409
You look just the way ginglebusher sounds.

1054
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,620
Oh, then I... I can't look so terrible.

1055
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,500
Won't you sit down?

1056
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:11,797
- What I came to see you about was...
- Oh, yes, miss ginglebusher.

1057
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,803
Well, I mean,

1058
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:18,661
don't you think if you've got something to say to
somebody, well, you just ought to say it right out,

1059
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,894
and that way they don't make mistakes and spoil
everything by saying something they shouldn't say

1060
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,649
or anything, don't you think?

1061
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,901
I beg your pardon?

1062
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,233
Well, I hope you won't be disappointed.

1063
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,068
I mean, that you won't feel...

1064
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,154
Disappointed? My dear child,
after what's happened to me today,

1065
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,741
I can bear anything.

1066
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,406
Oh, that's fine, because
I didn't know just...

1067
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,997
Well, I mean, some people are funny.

1068
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,286
The reason for...

1069
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:50,422
Do you know what's happened to me today?

1070
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,547
Yes.

1071
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,800
I mean, no.

1072
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,282
You are looking upon
the general European legal representative

1073
00:57:56,306 --> 00:58:01,175
of the south American...
Meat packing company, ltd.

1074
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,560
Hence the magnificence.

1075
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,516
Are you glad about it?

1076
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,180
Glad?

1077
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,442
When you say glad, do you mean stupefied,

1078
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,480
jubilant, triumphant, and thunderstruck?

1079
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,444
- I guess so.
- Then I'm glad.

1080
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,722
And ['ll tell you why, more than anything else,
because it vindicates what I've always contended,

1081
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,829
that right is right, and that
integrity is the shortcut to success.

1082
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:27,038
- Yes, that's right, but what I wanted to talk...
- Then kindly allow me to finish.

1083
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:31,171
For years I've starved in this very spot where
you now see me surrounded by expensive luxury.

1084
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,252
For years, my dear child,
for years, understand,

1085
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,792
I have dreaded every pull on that doorbell

1086
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,383
knowing that it meant always
a summons for the rent

1087
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:42,596
or a man to shut off the water or some
individual bent on the removal of my gas meter,

1088
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,135
and why, I ask you, why?

1089
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,476
- I'll tell you why.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you...

1090
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,891
Because I uphold the standard of ethics,

1091
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:55,278
and such a lawyer is useless to people
interested only in gouging their fellow men.

1092
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,938
Many times I weakened,

1093
00:58:56,992 --> 00:59:00,735
many times I nearly sank to the low level
occupied by my fellow lawyers,

1094
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,403
steeped in the law
but unconcerned with justice.

1095
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:08,201
Many times I faltered,
but something always held me back,

1096
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:14,044
and now, by virtue of that very something,
honesty brings its reward.

1097
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:18,552
You see before you a man whose fees total
between 100,000 and 120,000 kronen a year,

1098
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,303
um, limited.

1099
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,180
Oh, you've got it all figured out.

1100
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,439
What was it that rewarded you?

1101
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:32,600
Integrity.

1102
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,964
It so happens that the company
were looking for an honest man,

1103
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,216
and our president, Mr. konrad,
a charming fellow, by the way,

1104
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,481
heard of me and, uh, there you are.

1105
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,944
I see.

1106
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,031
And who do you think sent him?

1107
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:48,620
- Who?
- One of our most distinguished ministers, Dr. Metz.

1108
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,624
- Oh.
- Yes.

1109
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,501
And now, what was it you wanted to tell me?

1110
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:56,085
I'm afraid I allowed myself
to be carried away for a moment.

1111
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,170
Nothing.

1112
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,054
Oh, but there was something.

1113
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,763
You were afraid I was going to be
disappointed about something.

1114
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:11,101
No, I, uh, I wanted some legal advice.

1115
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,641
What have you been doing
that you shouldn't?

1116
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:15,900
Nothing really.

1117
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,777
Then I'll tell you what I'll do.

1118
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:21,657
For one thing, because you're the first client
to arrive since this world-shaking event,

1119
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:25,239
and for another thing, because I think you're
a very nice, young girl and I like you,

1120
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:30,203
from now on, I'm your legal
advisor for nothing.

1121
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:35,918
- For nothing?
- For nothing, free, gratis, without charge.

1122
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,628
Why, that's very generous of you, but I...

1123
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:41,760
No, no, please, don't thank me,
I feel like doing it.

1124
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:45,548
After all, if you find a chance
to do something for somebody, do it.

1125
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,636
- Do it with a smile.
- Exactly!

1126
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:51,019
And now, what is this very
important legal matter?

1127
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,519
The coffee.

1128
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,030
Did you know there's an icebox
that actually makes its own ice?

1129
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,316
- No.
- And with gas?

1130
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,484
I don't believe it.

1131
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,807
I don't either, but I read about it,
and I might even buy one.

1132
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,573
Our president, that's Mr. konrad, you know,

1133
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,786
suggested this morning
that I buy a motorcar.

1134
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:13,871
- No!
- Yes!

1135
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,912
Well, not a big one, of course,
just something to drive around in.

1136
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,546
How many cylinders?

1137
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:22,130
Oh, I don't know, I should think...
One to start with.

1138
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,544
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

1139
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:25,588
I should use it for visiting
our various branches.

1140
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,050
We have a great many, you know.

1141
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,263
You talk as if you've been working
with them for a long time.

1142
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:32,519
I feel as if I've grown
up with the company.

1143
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,179
What color are you going to get?

1144
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:37,315
Red shows up nicely,
or do you like green?

1145
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,601
I was thinking along the lines
of a nice, quiet black.

1146
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,064
That's if I get one at all.

1147
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,150
Do you want to look like an undertaker?

1148
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,863
Why don't you get something cheerful
like yellow or blue or green or...

1149
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,493
Or what I like, pink.

1150
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,120
- Pink?
- Why not? I think that's a pretty color.

1151
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:55,159
I think a nice, conservative black,
and a very deep shade of it.

1152
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,828
Well, of course, it's your car,

1153
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:02,215
but if it was me,
I certainly wouldn't get it black.

1154
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:07,129
And I certainly wouldn't wear
a beard either.

1155
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,422
What?

1156
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,681
Well, I wouldn't.

1157
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,787
- Oh, you wouldn't?
- I know it is any of my business,

1158
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:17,431
but if I didn't have anything to hide,
I certainly wouldn't wear a beard.

1159
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:20,146
What was the legal question
you wanted to ask me?

1160
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:24,780
- I'm sorry.
- There was some question.

1161
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,110
Well, it was just...

1162
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,027
If a girl told a man she was married
and she wasn't,

1163
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,992
but she only did it because she had to
because she was frightened,

1164
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,283
and then he asked her about her husband
and she told him...

1165
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:37,997
Is anything wrong in that?

1166
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:39,286
Wrong in what?

1167
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:42,376
I mean, when he asked her husband's name
and she just...

1168
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,292
This girl just picked out
some name or other,

1169
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,301
is there anything wrong in that?

1170
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,133
I shouldn't think so.

1171
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,549
It wouldn't matter what name or anything?

1172
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,594
She didn't get anything from him
under this assumed name, did she?

1173
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:58,309
Oh, no, she didn't get anything, nothing.

1174
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,771
Then she has nothing to worry about.

1175
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,562
And she may drink her coffee in peace.

1176
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:11,827
But if I had a name like ginglebusher,
I should certainly use no other.

1177
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:16,456
If I had a beard like that, I certainly
wouldn't make fun of ginglebusher.

1178
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:20,915
That, I think, concludes
the legal business.

1179
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:24,707
- I wish you'd take it off.
- Never.

1180
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,779
Put your hands like this a minute,
I want to see something.

1181
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,715
- I will not.
- Please?

1182
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:34,178
- Beautiful, it's got to come off.
- Don't do that, you don't know what you're saying.

1183
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,684
All right, but then it's got to be pink.

1184
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,470
- Pink?
- Of course it has!

1185
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,889
You can't take that beard around
in a black car.

1186
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,648
Why, you'll frighten the children.

1187
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:44,559
You ought to be spanked.

1188
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,648
I'm sorry.

1189
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:48,313
Let's go out and buy it right now!

1190
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,779
Buy it? I merely mentioned it
as part of the day's news.

1191
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,864
One doesn't buy motorcars like that.

1192
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,371
He told you to get it,
and if you get it, you've got it.

1193
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,877
Otherwise he might change his mind
tomorrow, and then where would you be?

1194
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,664
- Why should he change his mind?
- I don't know, he just might, come on!

1195
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:08,863
Mind you, if I go with you, I want it distinctly
understood that it's merely to look at one.

1196
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:11,469
Under no circumstances
will I even consider buying it.

1197
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,425
Yes, sir. Come on.

1198
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,901
This is one of the most wonderful
sensations I've ever experienced.

1199
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,610
I feel like a bird.

1200
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,650
- Oh, I got it.
- All right?

1201
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,703
I... I think you'd better stay on the left.

1202
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,168
I feel safer in the middle.

1203
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,960
Do you know what would
make me still happier?

1204
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,095
- What?
- When you get a new suit.

1205
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:58,053
- Do you think I really should?
- Doctor, I really do.

1206
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,718
Then I shall.

1207
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,772
We'll buy today.

1208
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:09,107
Never let it be said that a sporum
ever refused the request of a ginglebusher.

1209
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,895
Oh, really?

1210
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:19,154
What do you mean, really?

1211
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:21,539
You know what I mean.

1212
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,826
My dear miss ginglebusher, on the pretext
of calling on some legal matter...

1213
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:29,122
"No sporum ever refused
a ginglebusher's request."

1214
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,793
Apparently you've no idea what a beard
means to a man without children.

1215
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,839
I know how it looks
on a man without children.

1216
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:41,885
My dear young lady, if you continue to argue
along those lines for the next 78 years...

1217
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,394
All right, all right...

1218
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,977
I still would cling to my beard.

1219
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,322
Just a second, please.

1220
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,785
Thank you.

1221
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,211
Proceed.

1222
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:18,630
No, no, no, wait.

1223
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:23,677
You don't really have to,
if you don't want to.

1224
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:27,063
Wouldn't you like to go and look
at the pretty things out there?

1225
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,144
Oh, excuse me.

1226
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:47,459
Why don't you just take a shampoo
and let it go at that?

1227
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,290
No.

1228
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,795
Take it off.

1229
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,757
- It is criminal, that's what it is.
- Do you think so?

1230
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:58,260
I certainly think so.
That's a beautiful beard!

1231
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:01,343
Thank you. So is yours.

1232
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,882
Thank you.

1233
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,894
Why don't you change your mind?

1234
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,936
Look!

1235
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,272
Off.

1236
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,065
- Off?
- Off.

1237
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,528
Off.

1238
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:32,346
But Meredith.

1239
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,736
But Meredith.

1240
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,328
Lovely.

1241
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:54,543
I say, it looks lovely, I thought you
might have some comment about me.

1242
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:57,797
I'm... I'm afraid you've made some mistake.

1243
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,379
You bet I've made some mistake,
miss ginglebusher!

1244
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:03,044
Look at what I let you do to me. Look!

1245
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,472
You!

1246
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,136
Yes, it's me, what's left of me.

1247
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:15,478
Firstly you see before you
a man who has to shave!

1248
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,643
The bane of human existence. It takes
time, trouble, ruins the disposition...

1249
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,482
- You look simply...
- Please let me finish.

1250
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,817
Secondly, it kept me warm in winter
and cool in summer,

1251
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,387
besides giving me something to do
with my hands when I was nervous.

1252
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,447
Oh, very funny, very funny.

1253
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,739
You don't seem to realize that a beard
is man's crowning glory,

1254
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,270
the thing above all else
that distinguishes him from the animals.

1255
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:37,082
There are even animals that can speak,
such as parrots,

1256
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,541
but there are none with beards.

1257
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,798
Such as Billy goats.

1258
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,753
I feel so nude.

1259
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,513
You look so gorgeous.

1260
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,890
Oh, no, no, don't talk poppycock.

1261
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,097
- Oh, but you do.
- Anybody can look like this.

1262
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:54,262
The other way, I...
I looked like a lawyer.

1263
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:58,479
And now you look like
a general south American legalizer.

1264
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:02,066
Oh, well, I suppose I should
get used to it in time.

1265
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:06,074
- Who is this nobleman?
- Oh, isn't it beautiful?

1266
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:08,986
- Yes, but what is it?
- Genuine foxine.

1267
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,656
Uh-huh, probably related
to a fox or something.

1268
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:16,159
Oh, no, please, no,
you're not going to take it off, are you?

1269
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:20,922
I mean, after all,
what's a foxine between friends?

1270
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:24,710
You've been so kind, and I...
I forgive you even this.

1271
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:28,346
I wish you'd accept it, I really do.

1272
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,554
Oh, you don't... you don't have
to give me anything.

1273
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:34,890
Oh, no, of course I don't, I know that,
but it would make me happy to know

1274
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:38,102
that you were snugly wrapped
in a... in a genuine foxine.

1275
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,687
It is extremely warm, I believe.

1276
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,274
I'd love to take it from you.

1277
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,405
Oh, good.

1278
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,861
Please.

1279
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,743
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

1280
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,211
Now...

1281
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,127
Well, what's the matter?
What ever is the matter?

1282
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,296
Nothing.

1283
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,680
Please, what is it?

1284
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:17,266
Well, it's just that,
nobody ever gave me anything before,

1285
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:20,273
and it makes me feel sort of funny.

1286
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,525
Nobody ever gave you anything?

1287
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:27,280
You see, when you're an orphan,
you haven't got any family or anything.

1288
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,485
I am so sorry.

1289
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:32,152
I mean, when you're an orphan,
you haven't got anybody to do things for.

1290
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:36,448
I mean, you really have plenty, of course,
but nobody your own you really want to for.

1291
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,661
Don't you see?

1292
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,120
Yes, but not clearly.

1293
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:43,504
Well, I mean, I suppose everybody really wants
to do something for somebody, naturally,

1294
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:48,088
because it makes you feel good
and all happy in your heart and...

1295
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,721
Well, I suppose everybody really wants
to feel that way, don't you think?

1296
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:54,758
I believe one could say that with safety.

1297
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,972
That's why I like you.

1298
01:11:57,021 --> 01:12:00,013
Do I gather from your statement
that you have done or are about to do

1299
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:02,557
or wish to do me some good?

1300
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:06,194
Oh, no, no, I just meant, well,

1301
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,527
that if something came along
where I could do you some good,

1302
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:14,569
why, why, naturally, I'd be glad to do it,
but I don't suppose it ever would, do you?

1303
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,283
I mean, where I could.

1304
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,916
I'd do it, though, if it
came along, if I could.

1305
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,792
Why?

1306
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:25,296
Well, maybe it's because I'm an orphan.

1307
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,206
There should be more orphans.

1308
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:29,467
Can I be of any assistance, sir?

1309
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,338
- Oh, no.
- Thank you, sir.

1310
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:34,927
Thank you.

1311
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,719
- Do you know what would be dreadful?
- What?

1312
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:43,014
If we lost each other and never saw
each other again now that we've met.

1313
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,147
Yes, wouldn't it?

1314
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:48,106
You know, we are, both of us,
practically alone in the world.

1315
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:52,694
Oh, I'm glad you are too.

1316
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:56,611
Now, I suppose we'll look
into the iceless icebox situation.

1317
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,788
What time is it?

1318
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,827
- Oh...
- But I could see you tonight.

1319
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,167
Splendid. I could call for you with a car.

1320
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,706
- Where do you work?
- At the...

1321
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:11,171
- Oh, no, I can't, I forgot.
- What?

1322
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,960
I have to have supper with a gentleman.

1323
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,576
It isn't important, but I told him I would,
and I guess I'd better.

1324
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,559
- I have to go to his hotel.
- His hotel... you mean, to his rooms?

1325
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,686
I suppose so.

1326
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:22,846
Well, shouldn't 1?

1327
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,857
- Of course you should if you want to.
- Well, I don't want to, I have to!

1328
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:29,815
You know I'd rather go with you,
but after all he's done...

1329
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,731
I mean, I guess I'd better go, right?

1330
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,570
Is this the gentlemen to whom
you gave the assumed name?

1331
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,781
- Yes.
- I see.

1332
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,071
For such a young girl,
you're starting out well.

1333
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,534
I'm not doing anything wrong!

1334
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,166
That depends on how you look at it.
Good day, miss ginglebusher.

1335
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:46,202
- Wait a minute!
- What is it?

1336
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,291
Don't you want to see me anymore?

1337
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,297
I thought we liked each other.

1338
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:53,210
Apparently we were mistaken. Goodbye.

1339
01:14:18,412 --> 01:14:21,199
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Come on, come on!

1340
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,538
- Hello there!
- Hello, dear.

1341
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,256
- Oh, hello.
- I thought I'd just better keep an eye on you.

1342
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,417
Where'd you get that fur?

1343
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,756
I don't want an eye kept on me.

1344
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,646
- Where are you going?
- I have an appointment.

1345
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,469
- Who with?
- None of your business.

1346
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,788
Not that Mr. what's-his-name,
not that meatball from last night!

1347
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,677
- Well, suppose it is.
- I won't have it!

1348
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,813
- I'd sooner lie down and die than...
- But I've got to, you don't understand.

1349
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,836
He thinks it's because
he's been honest all these years.

1350
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,068
It means so much to him, he's so happy,
he's got to stay that way, detlaff.

1351
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:56,948
Even if he doesn't like me anymore, he's
got to keep his pencil sharpener, detlaff.

1352
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,700
Who thinks what?
What do you mean, his pencil sharpener?

1353
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,827
The trouble with you is
you've been drinking again.

1354
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,863
Don't be silly!

1355
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,828
If you start out to be a good fairy,
you can't stop right in the middle!

1356
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:10,586
In the middle of what?
Where does the pencil sharpener come in?

1357
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:13,088
- You ought to be back in the asylum.
- Leave me alone.

1358
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,922
I positively forbid you to go to his rooms, or
even in the same neighborhood as the hotel.

1359
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:19,337
- Well, I'm going just the same.
- I won't have it.

1360
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,411
Don't you understand, something terrible
is gonna happen to you if you go out there?

1361
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,642
- What?
- An a-number-one calamity.

1362
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,052
A catastrophe!

1363
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,642
Something so terrible,
I can't bring myself to mention it.

1364
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,228
A regular cataclysm!

1365
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:34,519
Well, I don't know what you're talking
about, but I'd do anything...

1366
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:37,655
- I tell you, I won't have it!
- Well, you can't do very much about it.

1367
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,112
Whose car is this, what does this mean?
Oh, the shame of it!

1368
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,264
I'll put a spoke in your wheel
if it's the last thing I ever do!

1369
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,598
- You will not!
- Oh, yes, I will!

1370
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:44,782
- You will not!
- 1 will!

1371
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:47,369
- You won't!
- 1 will, I will, 1 will!

1372
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,460
Stop someplace where I
can telephone, please.

1373
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,623
Yes, ma'am.

1374
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,858
Ow.

1375
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,406
Yes?

1376
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,623
Yes, this is Dr. spo...

1377
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:35,287
Oh, my dear.

1378
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,798
Oh, it's so good to hear your voice again.

1379
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:41,256
I'm glad you're not angry with me anymore,
because I...

1380
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:44,047
Angry with you? No, no,
I was furious with myself,

1381
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,716
but when I went back to tell you,

1382
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:50,387
you'd gone, and then I realized
I didn't know where to find you,

1383
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:54,148
and when I thought I was never
gonna see you again, I...

1384
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:57,981
Tell me, do you forgive me?

1385
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,861
Of course I forgive you.

1386
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:03,900
That's why I called to tell you that,
and how much I want for you to be happy.

1387
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:06,660
I want you to be rich and...

1388
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:09,697
I can see you now with
your pencil sharpener.

1389
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:14,540
You're just like a little boy, really,
especially without the beard.

1390
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,795
That sounds silly, doesn't it?

1391
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:20,504
A little boy without a beard.

1392
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:23,169
I want you to do something for me,
I know I sound crazy,

1393
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,089
but after I hang up,
think of me for a little while.

1394
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:30,932
Think of me kindly, almost...

1395
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,642
Almost as if...

1396
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,522
I loved you.

1397
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,228
One minute, no, no, miss... miss...

1398
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,817
Luisa?

1399
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,324
Hello? Hello?

1400
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:57,870
Oh!

1401
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,348
Oh, well, here you are!

1402
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,683
Come in, come in.

1403
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:18,315
Now we'll... we'll just go right in here.

1404
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,397
I had everything all fixed up, and then,

1405
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,608
at the last minute, look.

1406
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,238
Very careless.

1407
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:29,527
Well, there's many a cup
'twixt a slip and a, whatever it is.

1408
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,990
The lamp's ruined anyway.

1409
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,280
Here, sit down.

1410
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,073
Don't touch it, look out.

1411
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:37,664
And I just had everything all fixed.

1412
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,203
Oh.

1413
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,212
You know, this is my first...

1414
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:43,715
I mean, I'm not used to... I...

1415
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,342
How do you feel?

1416
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,469
- Fine, thank you.
- Oh.

1417
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:49,721
- How do you feel?
- Oh, fine.

1418
01:18:49,767 --> 01:18:51,974
And how is everything
at the house?

1419
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:55,182
Oh, all right, I gave him
a good talking to.

1420
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,938
- Yes.
- And then we went out and bought a new car.

1421
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:01,100
- Oh, fine, fine!
- And then I made him get a new suit.

1422
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,984
Yes, well, he needed it.

1423
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,692
And then he got a new hat,
new stick, gloves,

1424
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,151
besides all the new furniture.

1425
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:08,801
- Yes, but...
- Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

1426
01:19:08,827 --> 01:19:11,739
- New shirts, new ties...
- Yes, but how about you?

1427
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,155
I mean, what did you get?
That, after all, is what...

1428
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:15,368
This.

1429
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,907
What, that?

1430
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,327
- That thing?
- Isn't it lovely?

1431
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,916
He gave it to me this afternoon.

1432
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:23,957
Oh, he did, did he?
Well, what's it supposed to be?

1433
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,593
- Genuine foxine.
- Oh, genuine foxine.

1434
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:30,755
He gets himself an automobile and new
furniture and a new suit of clothes,

1435
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:33,595
and you get a piece of a thing like that?

1436
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:35,726
"Genuine foxine."

1437
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,227
Genuine piffle!

1438
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:40,106
Well, I like it, it's mine.

1439
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,560
I think it's lovely.

1440
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,853
What does he mean by daring to present
you with a piece of cat like that?

1441
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:48,648
- It isn't cat!
- Don't tell me, skins are part of my business.

1442
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,989
That's cat, and very cheap cat at that.

1443
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,494
Oh, look what you've done!

1444
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,155
Oh, well, I didn't mean to...

1445
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:58,244
Oh, I love it so.

1446
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:00,034
Well, he ought to be ashamed of himself.

1447
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:03,692
You know, since meeting him, I'm not quite sure
I like the idea of your being married to him.

1448
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,674
- Oh, you don't?
- No. Genuine foxine.

1449
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,960
In the first place,
I don't like his personality,

1450
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:12,972
and in the second place, I think he's
miserly and unappreciative and two-faced.

1451
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:14,177
And in the third place...

1452
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,179
In the seventh place,
I don't trust him,

1453
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,474
and in the eighth place,
I don't like him in the first place.

1454
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,314
Well, don't talk that way
about my husband.

1455
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:29,321
- Huh?
- He can't help it if he's all those things.

1456
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,947
He was born that way.

1457
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:33,405
Yes, well, it serves him right.

1458
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,287
Besides, don't let's talk about him anyway.

1459
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,201
I'm off duty, you understand,
you haven't seen me.

1460
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,042
You mustn't be frightened.

1461
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,501
There's no reason.

1462
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:48,961
Sit down.

1463
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,252
There, that's right.

1464
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:53,546
Oh, well, there you are, you see.

1465
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:55,885
Last night I was full of Dutch courage,

1466
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,721
and when I'm full of Dutch courage,
I behave very frenchly.

1467
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:01,183
I mean, I'm a regular playboy.

1468
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,394
But when I'm not full of it,
you see, I'm different.

1469
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:08,048
Of course, when I make up my mind to something,
I'm like concrete, you've got to admit that.

1470
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:10,800
I mean, I certainly did everything
I said I was going to do, didn't I?

1471
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:13,236
Oh, my, yes, you were very generous.

1472
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,400
Yeah, well, that's fine.

1473
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,660
And now I want to tell you a secret.

1474
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,491
Don't be fooled by my looks.

1475
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,998
I mean, inside of me,
I'm not really... I've...

1476
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:25,332
- Not what?
- Well, I'm not what you think I am.

1477
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,088
- Oh, aren't you?
- No, I certainly am not.

1478
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,875
The reason for my great success
was never that I cheated.

1479
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:33,419
I hit hard, yes,
but always below the belt.

1480
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,588
I mean, above the belt.

1481
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:38,553
Do you mean that you...
You don't like me anymore?

1482
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:42,140
Like you?
Why, I worship you, I revere you.

1483
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:46,683
You... you electrify me,
you weld me into a... a...

1484
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,100
You get the idea?

1485
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:50,565
I mean, you make me dizzy,
that's exactly the point.

1486
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:54,607
I love you so much that I...
I think you're marvelous.

1487
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:59,120
I thought I could be, you know, one of
those men that toy with the other sex,

1488
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:01,621
but I... I don't know how to toy.

1489
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:05,410
I'm really not a butterfly,
I just look like one.

1490
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,828
I want to hear the patter of little feet.

1491
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:11,123
I want to hear voices calling me papa,
lots of voices.

1492
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:15,260
- Oh, no, Mr. konrad...
- I want to sit around the house in my suspenders and I...

1493
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:16,920
Oh, oh!

1494
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:20,762
Excuse me, you're on my foxine!

1495
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,347
Yes, I...

1496
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:26,605
I want to watch you knitting socks
for the little ones, stacks of socks!

1497
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,811
L... don't you understand?

1498
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,522
I want you to marry me.

1499
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:34,280
Oh, luisa, let's take the
bull by the teeth and...

1500
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:36,986
What's that? What's the meaning of this?

1501
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,868
Who is it? Keep cool, don't...

1502
01:22:39,913 --> 01:22:41,744
Ow! Help!

1503
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:45,282
It's all right, I'll...

1504
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,425
Detlaff, just a minute! Stop it!

1505
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,676
Where... luisa, lu!

1506
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:02,933
You're crazy! Detlaff, stop it!

1507
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,720
Oh... elevator!

1508
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,357
- I won't! Stop it!
- You come along!

1509
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,940
Luisa! Yes, I'm...

1510
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,981
If you don't come along,
I'll tell him the truth about everything.

1511
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:18,319
Detlaff, you wouldn't!

1512
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:19,824
Here, stop!

1513
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,361
I'll have you arrested! I...

1514
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,414
You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't.

1515
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:27,165
You! What are you doing?

1516
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:36,962
No, detlaff.

1517
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,508
I can't...

1518
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,300
- Hey!
- Come on!

1519
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:46,844
I ook out!

1520
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:51,477
This way.

1521
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,318
Taxi! Here, here!

1522
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,483
Come on.

1523
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,448
- Detlaff!
- Get in here.

1524
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:06,034
Hey! Come...

1525
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,699
Here, here!
What's the meaning of this outrage?

1526
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:11,744
- Take your hand off me.
- I'll have you locked up! I'll have...

1527
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,880
Haven't I seen you before?
I never forget a face. Who are you?

1528
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:17,291
- Why, ll...
- Don't tell me, the waiter!

1529
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,300
Drive on!

1530
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,961
Oh, I see it all now.

1531
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:23,096
How can you look me
in the face again, madam?

1532
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:24,953
- As you for, you miserable...
- Drive on, driver!

1533
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,137
Handed home-wrecker!

1534
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,436
Hey, hey! Ow.

1535
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,562
Here, uh, get out of the way, look out.

1536
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:42,316
- Just, uh, follow that cab, right, as quick as the cab.
- Yes, sir.

1537
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:43,859
- Oh, no, wait a minute!
- No, sir?

1538
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,153
- Better go to Dr. sporum. That's better.
- Yes, sir.

1539
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,697
Hurry up. Go on...

1540
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:01,585
Where's Dr. sporum?
I want to see him.

1541
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,278
Isn't he home?
Who are you, the new clerk?

1542
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,343
- Do I look like one?
- Yes, and not a good one.

1543
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:07,007
Well, we're moving mighty fast.

1544
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,346
What are you standing there for?
You ought to be fired.

1545
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:10,873
- What, again?
- What do you mean, again?

1546
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,209
Are you trying to be funny with me?
You get Dr. sporum immediately.

1547
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,690
- I am Dr. sporum.
- You're Dr. sporum?

1548
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,818
What do you mean, you're Dr. sporum?

1549
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,444
He's a fellow with a beard.

1550
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,775
Don't you think that I...

1551
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,406
Uh, huh?

1552
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,817
Uh...

1553
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,703
Oh, well, what's the big idea?

1554
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:30,831
- I shaved.
- You shaved, well, you look terrible.

1555
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:32,895
You don't look too well yourself.
What's the matter with your eye?

1556
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:35,356
- What do you suppose is the matter with it?
- I should call it a black eye.

1557
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,496
Well, that's exactly what it is.

1558
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:40,962
Come into your office,
I want to talk to you.

1559
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:43,127
And what do you think
of our new equipment?

1560
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,841
Yes, well, I'm not interested.

1561
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,882
Dr. sporum, a little while ago,
I left my hotel to go for a ride

1562
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:49,925
just to cool off, you understand,
nothing else.

1563
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,344
- Yes.
- Well, now, a taxi cab in front of me

1564
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:54,604
was pulling out at the same time,
and as it backed up,

1565
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,938
it smashed my headlights
and... and gave me a black eye.

1566
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:01,353
I'm merely explaining to you
why I followed the taxi cab.

1567
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,988
Because it smashed your lamps.

1568
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:06,821
Exactly. You don't blame me?

1569
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,452
I certainly do not.
I would've followed it myself.

1570
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:10,863
Yes, you certainly would.

1571
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:14,124
They were brand new headlights made by
zeiss and only put on this morning.

1572
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:18,003
Now, the point is I didn't know whether
they were covered by my insurance policy

1573
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,401
because they were not on the car
when I took out the policy.

1574
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,290
- Uh-huh, I see.
- No, you don't see.

1575
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,630
But I'm telling you why
I followed the taxi cab,

1576
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,824
for no other reason,
I want that distinctly understood.

1577
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:29,077
One moment, did the taxi belong
to one of the big companies?

1578
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,745
- Yes, but that doesn't matter.
- Oh, but it does.

1579
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:31,871
I tell you, it doesn't matter!

1580
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:34,853
When I caught up with the taxi,
I looked inside. That's natural, isn't it?

1581
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:37,710
Perfectly. You see, all the big taxi
companies form a pool among themselves...

1582
01:26:37,734 --> 01:26:40,380
I looked inside, that's perfectly natural,
and what do you think I saw?

1583
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:44,113
I seem to recall a similar case
of a man named Webber versus...

1584
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:46,148
Sitting in the corner of the taxi

1585
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:49,034
was an ugly, soup-stained,
impertinent waiter from my hotel,

1586
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,286
and in the other corner sat your wife.

1587
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:53,868
I was right, the insurance company
is entirely responsible.

1588
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,032
- Huh?
- The case is clear.

1589
01:26:55,085 --> 01:26:57,045
The insurance company
must pay for the headlights.

1590
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:58,648
Insurance company must pay
for the headlights?

1591
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,879
- Positively. The theory of navis refecta.
- Huh?

1592
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,194
Or the renovated ship,
was all very well established in Roman law.

1593
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,613
- You have nothing to worry about.
- I have nothing to worry about?

1594
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:09,033
If, in the course of time, every individual
part of a ship were replaced by a new part,

1595
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,077
the vessel nevertheless remained
one and the same, legal...

1596
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:14,093
But your wife was in the taxi
with the waiter!

1597
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,679
My wife?

1598
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,688
How can you laugh at such a moment?

1599
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:19,961
Well, because I haven't any wife.

1600
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:22,547
You haven't any wife? Well, what what
do you mean, you haven't any wife?

1601
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:26,860
- I mean, I haven't any wife.
- But you... you... you... you haven't any wife?

1602
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,444
No, I'm not married.

1603
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,779
You're not...
What do you mean, you're not married?

1604
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:33,389
I mean that I'm not married.
What ever made you think that I was?

1605
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:34,951
Well, I... I certainly...

1606
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,787
Didn't I give you
a five-year contract this morning?

1607
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,418
- Yes.
- And 10,000 kronen in advance?

1608
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:41,829
Yes, thank you very much.

1609
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:45,875
Well, there you are, I mean, you said...
How can you say you're not married?

1610
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,589
What... what's my being
married to do with it?

1611
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:53,348
Well, it's got everything...
We don't hire single men.

1612
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,509
They're not steady.

1613
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:57,848
Well, I'm sorry,
but you didn't say anything about it.

1614
01:27:57,898 --> 01:28:02,267
Why do you tell me that you're not married
when I know perfectly well you are?

1615
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,436
Oh, are you, by any chance,
calling me a liar?

1616
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:09,232
Well, not exactly,
but why do you evade your responsibilities?

1617
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,651
- Are you a coward?
- Not so that you could notice it, my fine friend.

1618
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:15,446
For two kronen, I...

1619
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:17,490
I'll take care of you in a minute.

1620
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:20,705
Yeah, we'll see who'll take care of what.

1621
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,232
- You've just about ruined everything.
- That's gratitude for you.

1622
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:25,167
But I told you he only wanted to marry me.

1623
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:28,380
Oh, that was all when Jonah ate the whale.

1624
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:31,261
Oh, how can you be so...

1625
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,671
Hello.

1626
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:37,184
I... I'm terribly sorry, my dear,
you catch me at a bad moment.

1627
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:39,436
Our president is here.

1628
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:43,065
Oh, he's here?

1629
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:45,145
You see, that's just what I told you.

1630
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:49,529
You and your friend, perhaps a little
later, or even the first thing tomorrow...

1631
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:51,235
You know I love to see you.

1632
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,070
So you're not married, huh?

1633
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:56,111
You're not married,
and what ever gave me the impression, huh?

1634
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,904
- You liar!
- Sir!

1635
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:02,702
All you need is an assault and battery case
like that friend of yours there.

1636
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,540
What do you mean,
you're not married?

1637
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,205
- What do you mean?
- Good evening, Mrs. sporum.

1638
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:11,002
You... did you tell the gentleman
we weren't married, maxy?

1639
01:29:11,054 --> 01:29:12,510
Did I tell the gentleman...

1640
01:29:12,556 --> 01:29:14,763
- If you ask me...
- Nobody asked you anything!

1641
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:17,094
If you speak to me
once more in that tone...

1642
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,179
- Oh, pooh, you...
- What does this mean?

1643
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,845
Yes, that's what I'd like to know,
but I certainly smell a fish.

1644
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,334
- Meaning me?
- You see, what really happened...

1645
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:26,771
- Just be careful, that's all!
- Stop it! Stop it, I tell you! Stop it at once!

1646
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,232
If you don't stop,
I'll have you arrested.

1647
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:31,567
Better, um, come inside.

1648
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:35,780
You see, Mr. konrad, when Max and I were married,
I made him promise never to tell anybody

1649
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:39,822
because my uncle, uncle detlaff,
didn't like the idea of marriage much

1650
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:42,662
because he tried it once
and he didn't care for it much.

1651
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,872
- Huh?
- Oh, please let me explain.

1652
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,081
I can explain everything!

1653
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,168
You don't mean to tell me
that this foul-looking individual is...

1654
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,674
- My dear luisa...
- Oh, maxy, please let me explain.

1655
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,053
So you see, Mr. konrad,
that's why maxy said we weren't married,

1656
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:58,886
and naturally, if you'd known that it was my
uncle detlaff in the taxi, why, you wouldn't...

1657
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:02,928
Yes, but you mean to tell me
that this stupid-looking goof is...

1658
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,688
Oh, yes, yes, only he's really very nice,

1659
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:07,599
and now everything's clear, isn't it?

1660
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:11,395
And so, I'll just show you to your car, Mr.
Konrad, because Max has a lot to do anyway.

1661
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,818
- Well, I don't know...
- Oh, detlaff, you keep...

1662
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:15,949
- Oh, take care of uncle...
- What is all of this?

1663
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,030
But I don't...
But I've just explained!

1664
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,195
Don't make me do it all over again!

1665
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,079
I'm afraid you'll have to.

1666
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,581
Oh!

1667
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:26,998
Oh, maxy!

1668
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:30,380
Oh, dear, well, I guess perhaps
I'd better just nip along.

1669
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,167
- I mean, these family matters...
- No, I think you should stay.

1670
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:35,460
And you, too, uncle detlaff.

1671
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:38,300
Very good, sir.

1672
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:41,057
- What is this?
- I can explain everything.

1673
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:44,219
- Nobody asked you!
- I think miss ginglebusher should do the explaining.

1674
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:47,389
Miss gingle...
Uh, who is miss ginglebusher?

1675
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,683
- That's me.
- Oh, no, don't be silly.

1676
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,398
I mean, you couldn't... there's no...
Who is Mrs. sporum?

1677
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,654
That would be my mother,
she lives in the country.

1678
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:58,237
- Yes, but I thought that...
- Little by little, it will come to you.

1679
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,028
Oh, shut up!
I don't know who lives in the country...

1680
01:31:01,081 --> 01:31:04,573
If only you could keep still
for a moment!

1681
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:08,076
Oh, well...

1682
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:16,217
Now, now, now,
what have they been doing to you, hmm?

1683
01:31:16,262 --> 01:31:17,593
Come along.

1684
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:19,755
Yes, yes, yes, yes, come along.

1685
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,924
There.

1686
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:23,433
Oh!

1687
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,015
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1688
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:32,101
There I was in the private dining room, and
detlaff was making faces at me, going like this.

1689
01:31:34,072 --> 01:31:38,236
And Mr. konrad said he was a rich wizard and he was
going to throw a fur coat at me and everything,

1690
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:42,527
and of course I promised Dr. Schultz to do a good
deed every day when she let me out of the asylum.

1691
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:44,195
- The asylum?
- Orphan asylum!

1692
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:46,456
- Oh. Who asked you anything?
- Oh, will you please?

1693
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,288
But I didn't really get frightened
until he picked me up in his arms

1694
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,498
and galloped me off
to his cave in the mountains.

1695
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:54,540
- What cave in the mountains?
- Oh, well, it was just a game.

1696
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:58,176
- The law has a different name for it, sir.
- Oh, uh, the law?

1697
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:01,088
So when I got really good and scared,
I told him I was married,

1698
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:04,599
just like that other time when I said
detlaff was my husband in the streets.

1699
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:07,306
- I thought he was your uncle.
- Oh, no, he's a waiter,

1700
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,845
but that didn't stop Mr. konrad.

1701
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:11,480
- He just said...
- Oh, but then she isn't married to anyone?

1702
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:13,642
I wonder if you'd mind, please,
just for one moment.

1703
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:17,153
He just said, "now you're married,
I can't give you a fur coat",

1704
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,234
but I strive on obstacles."

1705
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,024
- Uh, "thrive."
- "Thrive."

1706
01:32:21,077 --> 01:32:24,695
And then he yelled, "I've got it!
I'll make your husband rich!"

1707
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:26,989
This is where you come in, sir.

1708
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,033
- Me?
- Yeah, and then Dr. Metz came in.

1709
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:31,167
I saw a chance to do
a good deed for Dr. Schultz,

1710
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:36,081
so I looked in the telephone book to find
a husband and I found... Dr. sporum.

1711
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:40,252
All these doctors, what is this?
I don't... it sounds like a hospital.

1712
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:43,138
You mean you picked me
out of a phone book?

1713
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:46,471
I just said,
"eeny, meeny, miny, moe."

1714
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,555
Yeah, and you were moe.

1715
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,470
I see, very funny.

1716
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:52,514
I didn't mean any harm.

1717
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:55,400
You know I wouldn't want
to make you unhappy.

1718
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:59,233
I just wanted to be
a good fairy for somebody.

1719
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:03,400
You mean, you...
You told this man you were my wife?

1720
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:05,114
Yes, sir.

1721
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,581
Honesty is the shortcut to success.

1722
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,494
The standard of ethics, long may it wave.

1723
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:15,912
Integrity brings its reward.

1724
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:18,331
Mr. konrad coveted my wife.

1725
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:21,876
That was my reward.

1726
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:24,888
"To his excellency,
Dr. stanislas Metz at the ministry."

1727
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:28,596
Honored sir, it is with some trepidation
and enduring gratitude

1728
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:31,603
"that I dare to address you,
to thank you."

1729
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,605
There's nothing to cry about.

1730
01:33:38,655 --> 01:33:40,646
It's been very funny.

1731
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:44,361
Mr. konrad has lost a little money,
of which he has plenty.

1732
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:47,368
I've lost a little hope, that's about all.

1733
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:49,574
You haven't lost anything.

1734
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,455
Why are you crying?

1735
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,333
Was it to his apartment you went tonight?

1736
01:33:57,382 --> 01:33:58,497
Yes.

1737
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,756
Why?

1738
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:02,884
So you could keep
your blasted pencil sharpener, that's why!

1739
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,471
Oh, no, luisa.

1740
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:08,632
But I... I...

1741
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:14,476
I just wanted you to have... everything.

1742
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:19,894
I'm so sorry I made so much
trouble for everybody.

1743
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:23,063
I... I wish I were a real good fairy

1744
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:28,156
so I could just wave my wand
and undo everything I did.

1745
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,281
- Well, goodbye.
- No, wait a minute!

1746
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:35,791
I mean, it's all so simple now,
it's marvelous!

1747
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:38,419
I mean, you and I, we could... we...

1748
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:41,171
- No?
- No.

1749
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:42,377
Oh.

1750
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,294
But... thank you anyway.

1751
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:51,008
Oh, I...

1752
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,800
I guess this is yours.

1753
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,640
Oh, no, please, I...

1754
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:57,918
Yes, of course, and the motorcar, and the
equipment, and the balance of the money.

1755
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:01,309
You can have them whenever you like.

1756
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,353
Miss ginglebusher!

1757
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,032
Don't go.

1758
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:21,288
Luisa, don't go.

1759
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:28,340
Lu.

1760
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,971
Yes, Dr. s... Max?

1761
01:35:39,442 --> 01:35:41,103
We'll be very poor.

1762
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,143
I've never been anything else.

1763
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:45,107
But we'll get along.

1764
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:47,317
Even without his old contract?

1765
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:49,858
Oh, you will, will you?
Very independent, aren't you?

1766
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:53,074
Well, let me tell you, my fine friend,
that this man is signed with my company

1767
01:35:53,122 --> 01:35:55,033
for five years,
whether he likes it or not.

1768
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:56,644
- What?
- Yes, and if there's any breaking

1769
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:59,250
of contracts around here, I'll do it.
Who do you think you are?

1770
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:01,126
- But Mr. konrad...
- Oh, you really are?

1771
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:04,505
Never mind, I... I can use
one honest lawyer,

1772
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,336
but don't overdo it.

1773
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:07,626
You are the good fairy.

1774
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,590
You flew into my life
and changed everything.

1775
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:12,096
No, you're the good fairy
who changed my life.

1776
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:14,928
No, no, no, as a matter of fact,
I'm entirely responsible for...

1777
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:17,594
If you say it was you,
I'll punch you right in the eye!

1778
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:20,764
If there's any good fairy
around here, it's me!

1779
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:23,650
J faithful and true j

1780
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,562
j we lead ye forth j

1781
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:32,359
