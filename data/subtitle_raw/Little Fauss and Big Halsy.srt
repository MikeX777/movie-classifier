1
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,638
Yeah! Come on!

2
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,792
Don't worry about it.

3
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,185
Everything's gonna be
all right.

4
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,534
God! Is he dead?!

5
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:09,231
Where's his wife?
Where's his wife?

6
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:11,799
Gloria!Aah!

7
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:15,150
Don't worry about it!

8
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:22,113
Whoo-ee.Is he hurt pretty bad?

9
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,550
I don't know.

10
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,247
Somebody said
broke his back.

11
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,946
My! How'd he do that?

12
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:36,127
Cycles is a mean toy, lady.

13
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,263
Mahhh!MAN : Wait a minute.

14
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,918
Who's that? Get that man
off the course out there.

15
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,659
Hey, Red, get that guy
off the course.

16
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,443
There's no walkin'
on this course.

17
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:49,271
Everybody, stay back, now,
till the races are over.

18
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,577
We've only got a little ways
to go,

19
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,448
and these guys are tired.

20
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,494
And for outsiders, around here
we don't want anybody

21
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,800
out there on that course
till everything's all over.

22
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,849
Is this supposed
to be supper?

23
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,374
Hmmhh.

24
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,485
You just taking pictures
for yourself or what?

25
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,748
I'll tell you who you ought
to get a picture of.

26
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:37,624
Damn.
Dumb thing's jammed.

27
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,321
You let Little
look at it.

28
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:42,019
If it's broke,
he'll fix it good.

29
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,108
Comes to anything
mechanical,

30
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,806
Little's all but eerie.

31
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,811
Get your cheeks on that bike
and get off the track.

32
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,900
Now, move it. Come on,
let's get goin' there.

33
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,467
Hurry up.
Move it!

34
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,044
Crowd, we're gonna come
back in a couple more weeks...

35
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,742
You did good, Little.

36
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,744
That was good, son.

37
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,615
Thought the buzzards
gone and got you.

38
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,488
Did you see me
wavin'?

39
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,141
I was goin' as fast
as I ever went

40
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,665
in my whole life,
and then I fell off.

41
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,970
Well, you go
too fast.

42
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,320
If you stay on,
you win.

43
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,453
That's how you win.
You gotta stay on.

44
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,150
What's that, movies?

45
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:27,978
Come on. Now. Hurry!

46
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:30,329
Oh, Ma, now, don't--
Don't bother that fella.

47
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,678
I told him
we'd pay him

48
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,506
if any of 'em
was any good.

49
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,116
Just me and my bike?

50
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,901
Uh...
Sure, Little.

51
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:39,512
Hey, what do you think
of a boy, anyway,

52
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:42,558
that sleeps in his room
with his own motorcycle?

53
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:45,387
Just one for the mantle.
That's all I want.

54
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,084
We haven't got
a single picture

55
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,564
on the whole mantelpiece,
Seal.

56
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,392
Yeah. Hey, is that

57
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,176
one of them
instant machines?

58
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,613
I'll get your address.

59
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,616
All right, now.
Now, hold it.

60
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,052
Stay loose as a goose.

61
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,706
That's it. That's it.
Relax. Relax.

62
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,925
That's it! That's it!
Oh. Oh, hold it...

63
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,536
Life's too short,
darn it.

64
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,451
Mmm. Oh, ho.
Ha ha.

65
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,757
Someone's had
herself a brew.

66
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,411
Goes by too damn fast.

67
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,978
Yeah.

68
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,588
Now, keep it there.
Keep it up. Now, let's--

69
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,111
Let's see
that great big smile.

70
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,504
Yeah, hold it.
Hold it! Hold it!

71
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,114
That's it!
That's--you got it.

72
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,594
Oh, that's perfect.
That's beautiful.

73
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,422
That's lovely.
Yeah, I like it.

74
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,816
Give the man
our address, Dopey.

75
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,121
Okay, boy.

76
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,123
I can get it
off your facilities.

77
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,734
Oh, no, no, no.
I insist.

78
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:30,432
Here, you take one of
my business cards.

79
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:33,304
I told him the day he starts
bringin' his work home's

80
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,481
the day I move out.Well, you can laugh at me

81
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,308
if y'all want to,
but it's a fact

82
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,137
I ain't had a stool since
I been in Portable Potties.

83
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,662
That's a fact.
Look, I want-- No. Here.

84
00:06:42,706 --> 00:06:44,141
I want you
to read that. See?

85
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:46,666
"Portable Potties." P.P.

86
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,798
Pee-pee. Ha ha ha!Yeah, it's, uh...

87
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,800
You get that? Mom
thought of that one.

88
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,323
I did not,
Seally Fauss!

89
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:53,760
You did.

90
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,414
I was goin' as fast
as I ever went

91
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:56,980
in my whole entire life.

92
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,678
Yeah, but
you fell off.

93
00:06:58,722 --> 00:06:59,940
Yeah, I fell off.

94
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:02,072
Try and stay on,
son.

95
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,683
Try.

96
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,949
Aw, come on, you...

97
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,473
Damn!

98
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:12,996
Careful, now,
Little.

99
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,085
We don't want to put
no scratches on 'em.

100
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,347
Hey, how about you guys

101
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:17,958
givin' us
a little push, okay?

102
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,916
We happen to be
a little busy.

103
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,483
Oh, hell. Sure,
take your time.

104
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:23,137
Come on, now, son.

105
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:25,008
Push.
Just a little further.

106
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,314
Unhh!

107
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,620
Unhh.
Are you pushin' any?

108
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,360
I'm doin'
the best I can.

109
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,232
These potties, they seem
more trouble than they's worth.

110
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:32,886
Me and the wife
come down from Mendoza,

111
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,322
dang thing cuttin' out
on me every five minutes.

112
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:35,758
Now dang thing
won't even start.

113
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,804
My wife's getting
hotter 'n hell.

114
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,501
She's expecting
a steak dinner,

115
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,850
and I said, "Honey,
you just cool on down,

116
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,199
"'cause those folks
over there

117
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:43,940
is gonna give us
a little push."

118
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,814
Say, you got all
your beer locked up?

119
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:49,990
I don't sell no beer.

120
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:53,646
Little...you can go
load your bike now.

121
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,996
Sure like to buy y'all
a beer, damn it.

122
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,433
Monkey-haired,
sideburned son of a--

123
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,869
Now, don't
get riled, Seally.

124
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,392
Well, he can just go
straight to hell

125
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:03,046
with his flair,
for all I care.

126
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:04,395
Well, they'll
be stranded.

127
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,528
Well...I ain't
givin' no hand

128
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,443
to no undesirable.

129
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,012
Got a cigarette?

130
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,232
Don't smoke.

131
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,540
Aw, damn it.

132
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:19,802
Just gave my last
cigarette away.

133
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:22,283
Damn it.

134
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:25,286
Just spent my last 2 bucks
gettin' here today, damn it.

135
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,724
Blew my pickup
comin' on over, and then

136
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,421
burned out my bike
in the trials,

137
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,423
so I didn't win nothin'.
Then I lost my sponsor,

138
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,121
if I'd had any luck,
which I didn't have,

139
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:37,124
so now I don't
even have a smoke.

140
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,126
You ready, son?

141
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,954
This guy wants
a push, Dad.

142
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:44,087
Hey-o, just a little shove's
all I need to get her goin'.

143
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:46,786
Aw...

144
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:58,014
Hey. Hey,
how 'bout a push?

145
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,450
Hey, what the hell?

146
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:04,412
Come on, aren't you gonna--
Hey, I need a push, damn it!

147
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,342
Let's have
a nice big smile.

148
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,780
Come on, ice cream.

149
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,739
Oh, that's great.
Hold it.

150
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,524
Okay. Hey,
that was a-number-one.

151
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,091
That's really good. You
want to take another one?

152
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,396
Hey, how 'bout a beer?
You want a beer?

153
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:33,615
Oh, sure, sure.
Okay?

154
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,269
Hey. Goddamn.
I forgot my wallet.

155
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:36,662
It's in the pickup.
Uh...

156
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:37,967
Oh. Well, here.
Here.

157
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,403
Hey.
Here you go.

158
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,970
I'll catch you.
I'll catch you later.

159
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,581
You remember? Okay.

160
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,107
Gimme three beers.

161
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,806
Hey, man you was really
workin' out there today.

162
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,504
Cranked around them corners
with the big boys.

163
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,245
Yeah. You race today?

164
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,856
Ho ho! On that
dumb-ass course?

165
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,118
Not me, buddy.

166
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,728
Didn't think
I seen you out there.

167
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,600
Hey, man,
what class you race?

168
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,514
You'd'a seen me, babe.
I'd'a had you at the fence.

169
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,994
What class
you race, man?

170
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,170
Hey, you're gonna gimme
three steaks, too, huh?

171
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,172
And put it on my tab.
My manager's got it.

172
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,696
Who in the hell
is that?

173
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,176
That's the cat got
suspended out at Ascot.

174
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:15,570
Boozin' it up
in the pits, man.

175
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,489
Hey-o. Bubble
for the system.

176
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,099
You...

177
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,362
Sorry. Oh, damn it!
I forgot your change.

178
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,539
Oh, oh, oh... That's
all right. That's all right.

179
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,150
Hey, where was I at?

180
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,587
Hey, you were gonna tell me
how you broke your spine.

181
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,110
Which is what first
caught my eye.

182
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,199
And to this day,
I can't sleep in a bed.

183
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:38,201
Hell, man, where
do you sleep, on the floor?

184
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,335
That's right. That's
where, on the floor.

185
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:44,947
Must make it pretty hard
on the little lady here.

186
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:47,341
I mean, if your husband's
sleepin' on the floor all night.

187
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,386
What I mean is,
it, uh...heh heh...

188
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,779
must be pretty hard
on you.

189
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,085
Him?

190
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,608
Yeah, well,
it would on me.

191
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,305
I haven't seen a floor
since I met him,

192
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,567
much less a bed.

193
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,787
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.

194
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:01,355
The whole two weeks
we been in love.

195
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,704
We been sleeping
in the car.

196
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,575
Oh, then you two
aren't married, then.

197
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,405
No, this is my buddy.
This is my bosom buddy.

198
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,277
Aren't you, honey?
Show him your bosoms.

199
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,582
Hey...well...

200
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,236
Why don't I just get

201
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,890
a room out here, then,
and, uh,

202
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,892
we all just settle
down for the night?

203
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,721
Hey...

204
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,244
My name is Halsy Knox.

205
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,724
Hi.

206
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,726
This here is
what's-her-name from Simi.

207
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:26,728
Ooh, yeah.
Sylvene McFall.

208
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:29,165
Hi. How do you do,
Sylvene?

209
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,472
I just guess we're all
free, white, and 21, huh?

210
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:34,040
And, uh...
Anything goes?

211
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,853
Gotta keep movin', honey.

212
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,855
Look out. Get outta my way.
I'm gone.

213
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:49,218
Hey.

214
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,918
You got any lube nipples
for a Yamaha 250?

215
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,398
No?
No got.

216
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:56,704
Shit.

217
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,063
Oh, boy.

218
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:36,396
You got head gaskets?

219
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,093
Oh, head gaskets we got.

220
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,236
Owner around?

221
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,325
He's out to lunch.

222
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,863
Thought I'd promote myself
a couple of tires

223
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,300
if the boss is around.

224
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,954
Them I got
seen too many races

225
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,826
if I head out to the desert
on Sunday. You goin'?

226
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,959
That's a buck-59
for the gasket.

227
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,482
Hey, let me use your,
uh, torque wrench

228
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,006
for about 5 minutes.

229
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,662
Thought you said
he wasn't around.

230
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,055
He'll be back.

231
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,883
After lunch, you said.

232
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,841
Hey.

233
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,278
It's a buck-59.

234
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,324
Hey, it's a buck-59.

235
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,326
Hey, incidentally,
um...

236
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,547
It's a buck-50
for those gaskets

237
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:42,766
plus, let's see...
9 cents tax.

238
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:46,205
You sure got some small
ideas about friendship.

239
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,597
Hey, what's the matter,
you think

240
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:48,903
I ain't gonna pay you
or somethin'?

241
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,600
Hey, forget it.No.

242
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:53,081
I always pay my own bills.
Where is that?

243
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,604
Oh, well, if you're
gonna use that gasket,

244
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:55,954
you'd better
seat it first.

245
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,172
Seat it?

246
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,131
Yeah, so you don't get
any blow-by.

247
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:02,351
Well, I'm no scientist.
I just ride bikes.

248
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,049
Is this coffee for
the general use here?

249
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,876
Customers.These sponsor guys

250
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:07,661
are a pain in the ass,
anyway. I hate 'em.

251
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,445
How you doin' on sugar?

252
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,273
What?Sugar.

253
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:12,622
What about it?

254
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,276
Don't have to
stay up all night

255
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,409
workin' on a bike
the night before.

256
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,890
They just stay up all night
lovin' the women

257
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,936
and drinkin' it up and
doin' whatever they damn want.

258
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,115
How about
a little cream?

259
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,291
Hey, where's your...
Where's your wife today?

260
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:30,814
My who?

261
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:32,294
Uh, you know,
I met your wife.

262
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,470
Oh. Uh...Yeah?

263
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:37,125
Yeah. She's, uh...
She's a stewardess.

264
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,127
Had an early flight
out this mornin'.

265
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,173
Didn't have no time
to fix me any breakfast.

266
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,783
Whose doughnut is this?

267
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:45,003
Is this somebody's?

268
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,353
Come on, I'll let you
buy me a beer.

269
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,747
What's so funny?

270
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,470
Hyah! Hyah!

271
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,341
Yahh! Yahh! Yahh!

272
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:21,952
Whoo-hoo!

273
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,520
Hyooh! Hyah! Hyah!

274
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,609
Come on, hyah! Yahh!

275
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,264
Hahh! Hahh!

276
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:31,049
Yahh ha!

277
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,240
Hyah!

278
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,167
You know, Seal,

279
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,474
we want to hear
Little's side of it

280
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:51,259
before we start
leapin' at conclusions.

281
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,960
What we got
for dessert, Mom?

282
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,441
I got whip 'n' wonder,
wet 'n' warm,

283
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:02,227
and slit 'n' serve.

284
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,838
Well, it don't make
no never-mind to me.

285
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:07,188
Well, whichever.
Speak up.

286
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,235
It won't stay
with me 20 minutes.

287
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,412
It just don't sound
like Little to me.

288
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,240
Houndin' sheep
on a cycle.

289
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,242
Well, where is he,
then, huh?

290
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,200
It's not humanitary.

291
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,160
Look, Frazier
done seen him.

292
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,378
He seen him!

293
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,901
Someone on a cycle.

294
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,425
That don't mean Little.

295
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:28,427
Specially bein'
two of 'em.

296
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,385
We're the only friends
Little's got.

297
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,952
You know that.

298
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,259
He don't have
no friend.

299
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,217
Oh, come on,
let's eat.

300
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,480
Ya-hoo!

301
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:24,265
Hi, Ma! Hi, Pa!

302
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:28,443
Little!
Where've you been?

303
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,533
Ohhh...

304
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:32,839
Hey, Ma...

305
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,275
I just had
one beer, Ma.

306
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,016
I just...

307
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,496
Hi.

308
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,542
I'll have my whip
'n' wonder now, Mom.

309
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,153
Uh, this here--
This here's my friend.

310
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:44,633
Uh...my friend.

311
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:46,592
Hello.
How you doin'?

312
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,507
Dinner is done.

313
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:50,204
Well, we ate.

314
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,727
Yeah, we ate already, thank you.

315
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,034
Howdy Frazier
called me up.

316
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,645
He said two bums
on bikes

317
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,865
was tearin' up
his river-road acres

318
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,170
till he run 'em off!

319
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:01,607
Well, that's okay.
We ate.

320
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,654
I think
I gotta wash up.

321
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,960
Now, you hold on

322
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:08,483
a minute, Little.
You hold on!

323
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,964
Son, your father's
speakin' to you.

324
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,487
Well, I know that,
Mother.

325
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:15,490
Ahem. I know that.
But I don't feel good.

326
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:16,839
I don't wonder.

327
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,188
Hey, babe, you got that job,

328
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,625
you want to look good.
You better be clean.

329
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,541
Okay, Sideburns,
I told you

330
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:24,586
I want you two fellas
to hold on a minute!

331
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:25,848
Seally, peace.

332
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,328
My friend Sideburns
is waitin' here

333
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,199
on a part from Tulsa,
and I--

334
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,419
he's waiting on a--
For a part,

335
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:34,335
you know, from Tulsa,
and, um...ahem...

336
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,296
I invited him over,
uh, for the weekend.

337
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:40,994
Just till then.

338
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,474
Just through
the weekend.

339
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,868
Huh. Well, you know,

340
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:47,653
I think I should
wash up. Excuse me.

341
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,708
I gotta look for a job
for me, too, in the mornin'.

342
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:02,842
I can't collect my unemployment
out here till May.

343
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:05,018
So...uh...

344
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,759
you wouldn't know
about any positions

345
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:08,108
or anything open,
would you?

346
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,805
Had a job out in Texas.

347
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,416
But my old lady wouldn't
leave her girlfriends

348
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,721
and go on out there.

349
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,462
To hell with her,
though, right?

350
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:16,464
I mean, shoot, I had this job
right up until Christmas,

351
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,814
and she wouldn't
come out there.

352
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,381
Well, I don't give a damn.
I mean, I can get a job

353
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:21,991
over at Mira Linda
anytime I want.

354
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:25,168
Well, I suggest you just
go to Mira Linda, then.

355
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,562
Do you want a cup
of coffee first?

356
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:30,391
Nope. No, I--

357
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,872
Boy, these flies are...
somethin', aren't they?

358
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,917
Where did Little...
Where'd Little go to?

359
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:36,615
Hey, buddy.

360
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,660
Do you want instant frost
on your whip 'n' wonder

361
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:40,096
or just plain?

362
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:41,402
It don't matter
beans to me, Mom.

363
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,012
It don't matter
beans at all.

364
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,362
It'll just...

365
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,451
go right through me
tonight, anyway.

366
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:08,603
Okay, let's everybody
have their attention now.

367
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,344
Let's get
your attention here.

368
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,824
All right, now we got
about three minutes

369
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,434
until starting time
or less.

370
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,696
We're gonna have
a hare and hound.

371
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,437
We're gonna run it right.

372
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:17,917
Come on now,
let's everybody get back.

373
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,266
Give these riders
plenty of room...

374
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,050
What do you say, Halsy?

375
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,487
We've got a long way
to go and it's hot.

376
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:24,053
Riders, come on now.
Everybody get back.

377
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,403
How's it going, Halsy?

378
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,709
Hey.

379
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,011
Get off the line!

380
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,795
Can't you hear me?Sorry.

381
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,670
Come on, dude!

382
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:02,543
Come on! Come on back.

383
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,589
There you go.

384
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,199
Hey, dude.

385
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,766
The gun'll go off

386
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,768
at the same time
that flag'll drop.

387
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:12,161
Riders, let's get ready.
Knock off that conversation.

388
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,381
Let's be ready. That flag
can drop any time,

389
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:17,166
and anybody jumps that gun
is gonna be disqualified.

390
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,081
Ready? Watch that flag.

391
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:22,215
Go!

392
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,979
Get over! Damn it.

393
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:52,027
Yee-hah!

394
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,381
Yahoo! Woo-hoo!

395
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:10,611
Yah, yah!

396
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:13,483
Hey, man,
get it over!

397
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:16,138
Hey, get over!

398
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,217
Okay.

399
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,700
Hey, Hals, you dead?
You okay?

400
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:58,006
Hey, Halsy? Hey--

401
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:01,662
You ran right under me,
you bird-brained creep.

402
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,621
I think I broke
my leg, man.

403
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:07,015
What the hell you run
right under me for?

404
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,452
You hurt any?

405
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,454
Broke my chain, I think.

406
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:15,241
Goddamn it!
Out the way!

407
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:18,374
Goddamn bike!

408
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,507
What are you
gonna do, Hals?

409
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,640
Halsy, I can't get
out of my pants.

410
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,032
My leg's broken.

411
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,121
Yeah, go on, okay.

412
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,036
Get out!

413
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,956
Go on, you mother...!

414
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,877
You got matches?Matches?

415
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,357
How the hell am I
gonna find you

416
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:45,837
if when I come back
it's dark?

417
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:49,231
You'll be back
before dark.

418
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,886
They'll send somebody
back before dark.

419
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:54,236
Oh, not these Mickey Mouse
country road shows, man.

420
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,673
They don't take
no responsibility.

421
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:56,978
You're on your own.

422
00:27:57,023 --> 00:28:00,199
Heck, Halsy, you'll
be back before dark.

423
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,635
It's only 4:00.

424
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,593
Oh, yeah.
Only just light a match

425
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:06,727
when you hear me coming,
just in case.

426
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,208
That's right, you bastard!

427
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:13,429
In case what? You're
coming back or not?

428
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,214
I got a broke leg.

429
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:16,737
Hey, don't panic, man.
You panic in this weather,

430
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,870
it'll kill you.

431
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:22,569
Here you go.

432
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:24,397
What's this?

433
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,007
It's what's to do
in case of snake bite.

434
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:27,617
Read it.

435
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,632
One machine's coming
in,

436
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:44,373
and let's everybody
now remember

437
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:46,462
this race is only
for trophies here today, gang,

438
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,899
so let's give everybody
a nice hand

439
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,639
when they cross
that finish line.

440
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:50,945
We've still got a lot
of riders coming in,

441
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,338
a lot of winners
to sort out.

442
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:53,905
And all of you guys
now that think

443
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,428
you've won trophies here,

444
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:56,864
why, get your machines
and get over there

445
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:58,387
by that trophy table.

446
00:28:58,432 --> 00:28:59,911
All right, now,
let's get over there

447
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,304
by that trophy table.
What do you say?

448
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,568
Say, you ought to
be a model.

449
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:06,874
Oh, would you please
quit it?

450
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,354
No, I mean it. Oh, hey,

451
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:09,790
listen, now,
I'm an expert.

452
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,139
You know how many
races I've won?

453
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,880
Do you have to do that?

454
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,795
Every time, out comes
some trophy chick

455
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,492
who thinks
she's Ann-Margret.

456
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:18,233
Well, I never said
I was any Ann-Margret.

457
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:19,800
Listen, these hands
have held the boobs

458
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,933
of more top flight
actresses and trophy girls.

459
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:24,370
Well, I'm not any
trophy girl. Now, come on.

460
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:25,806
Please?

461
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,329
You've got 'em
all beat, my dear.

462
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:29,114
Oh, by a mile!You!

463
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:30,463
Two miles.

464
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,943
Yeah, but you know
they don't have

465
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:33,379
trophy girls
at Desert Enduros.

466
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:34,815
Yeah,
the cheap bastards.

467
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,731
All this racing,
no ass.

468
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,734
Would you please take
you hands off my things?

469
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,867
Some people
really don't know

470
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,694
how to take
a compliment.

471
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,174
Well, I thank you,
but, my gosh,

472
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,046
I mean, there's a lot
of people here,

473
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,352
and it's kind of embarrassing
in public and everything.

474
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:52,354
Why?

475
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,270
Well, I don't know,
but one thing is

476
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:57,316
you haven't even gotten
your trophy yet.

477
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,754
Oh, damned if I don't.

478
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,845
Hey, what're you doing?
No, put me down!

479
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,674
Put me down!

480
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:09,807
Yee-hah!

481
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:20,382
When are the other guys
getting back, Joe and Bill?

482
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:23,821
Aw, they'll be back here
any minute now, Don.

483
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:27,041
Hey, would you care for
a cup of coffee, Spike?

484
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:30,088
How about you, George?

485
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,959
Thank you, Joe.

486
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,832
Well, you're welcome, Fred.

487
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:37,835
I mean Bill.

488
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:41,012
Where you working now,
uh, Joe?

489
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,928
Oh, you know, down by
the railroad tracks.

490
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:46,408
Oh, you are? You like it?

491
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:49,585
Well, you know, it's, uh...
Oh, yeah.

492
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,719
Oh, well, uh, would you
care for an orange?

493
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:54,895
No, I don't want to
ruin my breakfast.

494
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,202
Hey, dude. I hate
to tear you away

495
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:59,378
from your friends...

496
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:00,814
We gotta split.

497
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,034
They got pro races
every weekend

498
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:04,905
out there in California
some place,

499
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,907
and if we split out
there, who's gonna know

500
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:08,256
who's you and who's me?

501
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:11,129
Oh, no, somebody's
gonna find out.

502
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:14,480
Oh, boy, you think
you're famous.

503
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,612
Ow!You know, it's a funny thing,

504
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:18,310
but nobody knows me
out there.

505
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:19,659
So how they gonna
know who's who

506
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:20,965
if I'm there
with your bike,

507
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:22,401
your license,
and your number,

508
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:23,881
and you're standing
right there to deny it?

509
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,579
How'll we split it up?

510
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,929
Halves. You see--
Hold it, excuse me.

511
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,713
All points go automatic
under your name,

512
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:31,932
not mine, towards
your expert card,

513
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:33,455
your standing
in the nationals,

514
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,196
which the way you ride
is the only way

515
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:37,938
you're ever gonna qualify,
if somebody raced for you.

516
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,766
You're acting like
you're doing me a favor.

517
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,028
Shit.

518
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:46,816
Seems like a good deal
to me the way I see it.

519
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,950
Yeah, for Sideburns.

520
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,126
If I want to race pro,

521
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,911
where could I race pro
around here?

522
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,000
What are you talking
about racing for?

523
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:57,653
You're his tuner,
Little.

524
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,829
He's racing, dummy,
on your bike

525
00:31:59,874 --> 00:32:03,007
with your license
'cause he got throwed out.

526
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:06,010
Meantime, I could hit

527
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:08,012
all the main events
across the country, Dad.

528
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,665
I can't do that
around here.

529
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,146
Meantime, who pays?

530
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:15,497
You know, I think
he done it a'purpose.

531
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,977
Broke my leg?

532
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:20,807
What's a broke leg
to his kind?

533
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:24,593
Oh, you'll have to
prove that to me.

534
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:27,596
Well, I might
just do that.

535
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,209
Well, I gotta go.

536
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:33,211
Hey, come on, dude!

537
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,833
Little? Little...

538
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:49,488
Uh...

539
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,186
The best fortune
to you, Little.

540
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,278
But I still don't
see no good out of

541
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,888
hooking up with
an undesirable

542
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,065
like that, though.

543
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:04,068
That goes ditto for me.

544
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:06,026
I know what y'all mean,
you know.

545
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:08,724
But if I want to race...

546
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,465
there's a lot I can
learn from him,

547
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,772
and, uh,

548
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:16,645
there's a few things I can
teach him, too.

549
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,866
Anyway, what else
is there to do?

550
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,133
And we're gonna split 50-50,

551
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,179
so, um...

552
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:29,876
there ain't nothing
to lose.

553
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,706
Let's get going!

554
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,837
Wait a minute! And as Fauss
went by out there

555
00:34:17,881 --> 00:34:21,754
he just took the front wheel
right out from number 80.

556
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:37,987
Halsy, come on!Come on, Halsy!

557
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:40,816
Come on, baby!
Come on, Halsy!

558
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:42,905
Hey, man.

559
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,256
Uh, great, Halsy.
Great, man.

560
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,866
Hey, out of
sight, man.

561
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,172
Man, this bike, whoo!

562
00:34:48,216 --> 00:34:50,130
Used them other
scooters for traction.

563
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,827
One more lap,
wasn't even half mile,

564
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,264
you would've been first.

565
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:54,700
You know what even
second pays?

566
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,528
$30. Screw first!

567
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:59,661
Hey, the beer's on you
for a week.

568
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:02,316
Beer nothing.
I'm getting me a pint!

569
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:05,928
Halsy! Halsy!

570
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:07,278
He fell right
in my groove, man.

571
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,627
Hell, I took two laps
before they could

572
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:10,019
even get him out there.
Did you see that?

573
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,412
Is he dead or anything?

574
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:12,805
It's just so
darn much fun.

575
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,154
Even though I'm
working so hard,

576
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,503
just sitting in there
in that position

577
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,201
it is just so exciting.

578
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,985
There's just one thing
I want to ask you, Halsy Knox,

579
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,421
and that's who
the hell is she?

580
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:21,683
Who in the hell am I?

581
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,120
Who in the hell
are you, you bitch?

582
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,469
You know, if I could just
get in there

583
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,166
and stay there all night
long even though--

584
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,733
Hey, hey!

585
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:43,923
Huh?

586
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,925
Hey, what are you
sleeping in the car for?

587
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:47,361
Somebody's gotta
guard the bikes.

588
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:49,885
I'll guard the bikes,
go on in.

589
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,149
Where'd you get
that flashlight?

590
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,020
Hey, man, look at this.

591
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:57,154
It cleans up lint,
it air conditions your face.

592
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,459
It's even got
a table on the side

593
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,766
that gives
weights and measures.

594
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,072
You're just gonna
cop it off her?

595
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:04,596
Well, listen, you get
stopped by the highway patrol,

596
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,075
man, they're gonna
give you a ticket

597
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,382
if you don't have
the proper safety equipment.

598
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,689
You going in or not?I guess I better not.

599
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:11,994
All right, go on.
Come on, go in.

600
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,300
Tell 'em I said
it was all right.

601
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,128
It's okay by me.
Go on.

602
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,870
I think I'm coming
down with a cold.

603
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:20,394
Oh.

604
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:23,397
Okay. Let's split.

605
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:25,225
You just cut out
on Moneth?

606
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,446
Yeah.

607
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,230
Hold on a second.

608
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,721
Hey, I thought
you said you had a cold?

609
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,375
Well, it's not
that bad.

610
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,855
Man, we're leaving.

611
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,641
I just thought I'd go
say goodbye to Moneth.

612
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,643
Oh, the hell with her.
What's she to you?

613
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:52,992
Nothing.

614
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,518
You know,
but, uh, if it's

615
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,955
such an easy set up
like you said...

616
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,479
Forget it.

617
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:03,611
Well,
now's a good time

618
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,265
to take care of this
shyness I got

619
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,658
and strike while
the iron's hot,

620
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:08,486
because nobody cares.

621
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,096
Well, Little,
you had your chance.

622
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,446
Couldn't I just...

623
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:13,882
take a peek?

624
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:17,190
Ohh.

625
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,628
To this year's crop

626
00:37:20,673 --> 00:37:23,022
add to the surplus
carryover.

627
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:25,067
As of the end of this year,
the surplus is expected

628
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:27,853
to be down
to about 12 million bales.

629
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:29,637
And on the basis
of current guesses,

630
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:33,685
the surplus could be cut
to about 9 million bales.

631
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:37,210
There has been a new proposal
for a compromise plan

632
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,516
to provide supplemental
financing...

633
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,476
It comes from
a Kansas congressman

634
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:44,696
who wants a scaled down
version of the program...

635
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,046
They're gonna feel
awfully bad, Halsy,

636
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,482
when they wake up

637
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:51,485
and find out
you're not here.

638
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,008
The bank would get
its initial funds

639
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,575
from the private
money market.

640
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,664
The system would make
loans to co-ops

641
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,319
who can afford to pay
higher interest rates...

642
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,539
No, sir, man.

643
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:06,283
Once a chick swings
AC-DC on you, split.

644
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,548
Once it's cool,

645
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,680
twice it's queer.

646
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,062
Hals?Yeah?

647
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,151
Are you awake?

648
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,937
I better be,
I'm driving.

649
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:57,986
Hey, man...
What the hell?

650
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,597
What did you do
to this car?

651
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:00,946
I was sleeping
in it.

652
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,687
Look at it,
look at the gauge.

653
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:04,384
That dude's
all the way over.

654
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:05,820
Well,
it's not my fault.

655
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,169
Well, you were sleeping
in the car all night.

656
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:08,519
What've you been
doing, man?

657
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:09,911
Exactly what I was
doing: sleeping.

658
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:12,000
Well, what were you
thinking about in there?

659
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:24,143
You better
get on this, dude.

660
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:42,553
Unh! Son of a bitch!

661
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:13,410
What's it gonna
do now, rain?

662
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:30,862
Hey, if I tell you
something,

663
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:33,865
you gotta
believe me, okay?

664
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:36,650
Well, I usually believe

665
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,478
what people tell me.

666
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,481
Well...heh!

667
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,570
Not this you won't.

668
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:46,181
Well, I don't know.

669
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:47,661
You know
what the truth is

670
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:51,404
unless it's what
people say, you know?

671
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,842
I bet you think I make
out really good, huh?

672
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:59,325
Well, I don't, I don't.

673
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:02,459
I don't make out good.
You know those girls?

674
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:06,201
You think I don't know
they're dogs?

675
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:08,987
I didn't know
if you knew or not.

676
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:13,121
I don't know why

677
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,907
with all I got
going for me

678
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:18,213
all I get
are the dum-dums.

679
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,783
They mean well, I guess.

680
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,524
You think I don't
know who they are?

681
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:26,526
What they are?

682
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:29,921
I didn't-- I didn't know
if they were or not.

683
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,142
Hey.

684
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:37,145
You know, sometimes
when I'm drunk...

685
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:41,149
I really think that
they're princesses,

686
00:41:41,194 --> 00:41:43,151
and then I wake up

687
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:45,937
and they're just pigs.

688
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:51,420
I just figured
you liked pigs.

689
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,861
Hey, that old Moneth
was bad, huh?

690
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:00,560
I just figured, you know,

691
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:03,694
if you wanted a pretty girl
or someone decent,

692
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:06,479
all you had to do
was snap your fingers.

693
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,223
No, man, I mean, that's
what I'm telling you.

694
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,573
It's just these gland
cases and hurting whores

695
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:14,966
that'll have me.

696
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,799
Where the hell are we?

697
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:27,456
I...I don't know.

698
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,028
Stay clean, man.

699
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:37,945
Hey, I'm not so clean.

700
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,121
I don't mean pure.

701
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,384
Aw, you should see
my thoughts sometimes.

702
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:43,995
I mean decent.

703
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:46,084
Hey, Halsy, you know,
just because...

704
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:48,521
Just because I don't
yak it up all the time,

705
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,436
you know, heh-heh!

706
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,135
I'm not just your pure
St. Peter, you know?

707
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:58,357
You know what?What?

708
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:05,756
All I say is...
It's just talk.

709
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:09,542
Uh, you sure--

710
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,283
You're a sure good
talker, man.

711
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,981
You had two chicks
in the sack.

712
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:17,768
And stupid me, man,
sleeping in the car.

713
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:06,381
It's pretty noisy again.

714
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:08,775
We gotta get
a colder plug.

715
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,864
If you guys
want to step it up,

716
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:13,171
we're running
a little bit late.

717
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:20,526
This will be a 250
through 650 class.

718
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,223
Uh, we're gonna run
a quarter of a mile

719
00:44:22,268 --> 00:44:24,051
on the asphalt
for at least 2 miles.

720
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:25,531
Are you gonna
pay attention

721
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:26,967
to what
this guy's saying?

722
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:29,317
Heh-heh! Over there.

723
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:31,406
Jesus Christ!

724
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:47,466
Oh, my hell!

725
00:44:51,819 --> 00:44:53,254
Okay, get rid of her.

726
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:55,213
Me? It's your truck.

727
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:57,737
Well, you're
a good Samaritan.

728
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,608
You're the Don Juan.

729
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:00,914
Hey, man,
just dump her out.

730
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,829
Get rid of her.
I don't care how.

731
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:04,701
And just
leave her there?

732
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,050
Well, they did,
didn't they?

733
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:07,529
Yeah, but they're
undesirable.

734
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,575
Hey, I don't want her
there when I come back.

735
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:11,490
Okay? Now I got
a bike to ride.

736
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:29,247
Hey, this is our truck.

737
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,741
Hi. This is our truck.

738
00:45:49,311 --> 00:45:50,921
Uh, you need a dime
or anything, you know,

739
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:52,792
to make a call?

740
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:54,751
Um, lady?

741
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:01,366
You where a gym is?

742
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,671
Hey, ma'am...

743
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:04,151
A gym?

744
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,153
Yeah. If we come to
a town with a gym in it,

745
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:08,068
just let me out at the gym

746
00:46:08,113 --> 00:46:11,071
'cause I gotta
start working out.

747
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:12,812
Man, I wouldn't pay
no attention to her.

748
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:14,205
I don't think she knows
what she's doing

749
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,728
or talking about
or nothing.

750
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,512
Who's your friend?What are you doing, lady?

751
00:46:17,557 --> 00:46:18,992
I don't think you can
find a gym around here, lady.

752
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,472
Because that's
the first thing you do

753
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:21,995
when you start
getting straight.

754
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,171
You just start eating,
putting on fat.

755
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:27,000
Uh-uh. You guys don't
turn on or what?

756
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:28,567
Now, listen, damn it.

757
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:30,047
I told you
about that light.

758
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:31,613
I'm just trying to
exercise a little.

759
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,006
You don't have to turn
around and pull me.

760
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:34,660
I don't see why I can't
do exercises.

761
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:35,922
Just don't push.

762
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:38,316
Come here.
Get out of here.

763
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,579
Hey, wait a minute, just--

764
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:42,929
Get out of the car.

765
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:45,932
Hey, hey, hey!Get out of the car!

766
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:48,892
Hey, come on, I'm just
trying to exer-- Okay.

767
00:46:48,936 --> 00:46:52,069
Want to taste
something good?

768
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:55,855
Wow. Wow, man.
Hey, Halsy?

769
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,597
Yeah, I heard, man.
A grubby chick.

770
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:00,251
You want to taste
something good?

771
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:01,643
Hey, no,
that's not funny.

772
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,080
It's just bad.

773
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:15,527
Hey, you don't have
a guitar, do you?

774
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:19,618
A guitar?Do you have a guitar?

775
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:23,274
Heh-heh-heh! We don't
have no guitars.

776
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:31,238
You play guitar?

777
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,240
Yeah.

778
00:47:33,285 --> 00:47:35,025
In New York City
I play guitar.

779
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:38,202
Let's go, buddy.

780
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,681
Yeah.

781
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:41,118
Somebody stole
my guitar.

782
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:44,077
No shit.

783
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:49,039
Hey, listen.
It'll be okay.

784
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,431
You'll find a guitar.

785
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,607
It's okay.
Don't stay, just split.

786
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,392
I don't want you
in my karma, anyway.

787
00:47:54,436 --> 00:47:58,744
I gotta be very careful
who I let in my karma.

788
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,964
Your what?

789
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:02,879
I'm not letting
nobody in my life

790
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,969
when I get straight
this time.

791
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:21,201
Hey, did you ever notice

792
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:23,856
that you can drive
all day and all night,

793
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,292
and wherever you stop

794
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:28,513
it's the same
greasy hamburgers?

795
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:30,384
The same fried eggs

796
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:33,953
served by the same
fat waitress?

797
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,520
Yeah, it's--

798
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:38,479
It's just like you never
went nowhere at all.

799
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:41,221
It's like you
never went nowhere.

800
00:48:43,485 --> 00:48:45,356
That's just what I said.

801
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,053
That's what
I said, dude.

802
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:51,101
It's always the same.

803
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:59,500
What're you gonna do
about her?

804
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:04,505
That's her lookout.

805
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:08,248
What's your hurry?
Where are we even--

806
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:09,641
Where we going?

807
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:14,951
Just some other
greasy spoon down the road.

808
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:18,824
Yeah, just some
other greasy spoon

809
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:21,653
down the road.

810
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:27,572
I gave her 5 bucks.

811
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:29,139
You gave her 3 bucks.

812
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:33,186
Oh. Was it 3?

813
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:37,147
What's she gonna do
on 3 bucks?

814
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:42,543
Big lover.

815
00:49:44,894 --> 00:49:46,373
I'm not the big lover.

816
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:49,550
I knew you'd get
yourself in trouble.

817
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:51,552
Well...

818
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:53,467
Well, you get
yourself in trouble,

819
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:54,991
why can't I get
myself in trouble?

820
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:57,036
Hey, because I can
get myself out.

821
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:58,995
I can get myself
out again.

822
00:50:02,086 --> 00:50:05,001
I want her.

823
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:06,393
You want her?

824
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:09,005
I can want somebody,
too, you know.

825
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:11,572
Oh, now, man,
I can get you somebody.

826
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:14,793
I can-- You could've
had Moneth.

827
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:16,838
I want somebody
that's my own.

828
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,057
What is that?

829
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:19,798
Dope-head community
screw, man?

830
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:22,540
She's nothing but some mama
for all them freaks.

831
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:25,412
No, man.
She's all alone.

832
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:48,044
You know what I wish?

833
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:51,221
What?

834
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:53,832
I had me
a Geiger counter.

835
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,573
A Geiger counter?

836
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:58,402
I'll marry me the first man
comes up with a Geiger counter

837
00:50:58,446 --> 00:51:00,665
and we'll live at the beach.
You know how much treasure

838
00:51:00,709 --> 00:51:02,971
there is buried
in the sand alone?

839
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:04,625
Plenty.

840
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,461
You know what I wish?

841
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:16,028
What?

842
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,509
That somebody'd ask me
what I wished.

843
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:21,120
Okay, what do you wish?

844
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:24,384
I wish that we'll
all be friends

845
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:27,474
and have good luck
and be happy.

846
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,132
How'd that happen?

847
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,221
Well, I was going
as fast as I ever went

848
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:39,747
in my whole life,
and I fell off.

849
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:42,141
Oh, him or me?

850
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:47,146
Yeah, how'd you
break your leg?

851
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:50,149
Hey, uh, remember
what happened in Digger?

852
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,933
He was working
on the oil rigs.

853
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:53,370
Digger?

854
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:55,023
Isn't that in Oklahoma?

855
00:51:55,068 --> 00:51:57,591
Uh, where the whole town
blew up or something?

856
00:51:57,636 --> 00:52:00,159
Never heard of it.

857
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:02,770
He wasn't expected
to live at first,

858
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:04,381
and then he was
never supposed to walk.

859
00:52:04,425 --> 00:52:06,034
Sure.

860
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,211
Shit, the way he said it,
I thought it was famous.

861
00:52:08,255 --> 00:52:11,953
Mm. Well,
the spine's integrity.

862
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:14,130
His is broken.

863
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:16,958
What's the leg?

864
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,612
The leg?

865
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:22,573
The leg's support.

866
00:52:29,798 --> 00:52:31,190
Slow down! Slow down!

867
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,497
Over here, over here!
Oh, you son of a bitch!

868
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:37,414
Watch where you're
going, you jerk!

869
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:40,547
We got a real celebrity

870
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:42,070
here with us
this afternoon, folks.

871
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:43,724
Rick Nifty's
in from the east,

872
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:45,291
so, this is the guy
that's the guy to watch

873
00:52:45,336 --> 00:52:46,727
here this afternoon.

874
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:48,512
Let's get all the riders
over here

875
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:50,166
for a riders' meeting,
and we'll be back...

876
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,951
All you tuners and sponsors
have got to conform, too.

877
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:54,474
No more of these
weird outfits.

878
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:58,174
We got too many of these
weird outfits in the pits.

879
00:52:58,218 --> 00:52:59,871
Now, you all want
to keep racing something

880
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:02,003
you can be proud of,

881
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:03,396
so we gotta get rid
of these high heels

882
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:05,093
and these tight pants.

883
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:06,834
I see there's some pretty
illustrious people here today.

884
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:08,227
Okay, now let's get back

885
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,620
'cause we got
a lot of things to do

886
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:11,578
and we don't
have much time.

887
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:12,971
Now, come on, men,
let's get going.

888
00:53:13,015 --> 00:53:14,320
Hey!

889
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:16,235
How you doing, Rick?

890
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,106
You probably don't remember,
but a couple years back

891
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:19,586
when the Army had me
for a couple years

892
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:21,066
and I got this back
messed up in Vietnam,

893
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:22,459
you and me went around
together at Sears Point.

894
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:23,982
Oh? Is that right?

895
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:25,549
How's it going, Rick?

896
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:27,768
When Uncle Sam calls
you gotta do your duty

897
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,248
and you do your duty
even if it costs you,

898
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:30,989
and you gotta begin
all over again.

899
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:33,078
Look, I gotta get to work
if I'm doing any racing today.

900
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:34,471
Oh, hey, no, sure.
I just wanted to extend

901
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:35,820
my apologies
for this rotten track--

902
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:37,778
Excuse me, honey.
This rotten track

903
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:39,432
and to tell you
to be sure and watch out

904
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:41,565
for that transmission fluid
on the track

905
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,044
and them grease stains
that they left

906
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:45,395
from the drag races
last night. Hey!

907
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:47,092
I wanted to tell you
it's a real pleasure--

908
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:48,572
A real pleasure
to go around

909
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,530
with a top professional
go-faster here today.

910
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:52,184
Maybe again next year
at Sears Point.

911
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,795
Oh, hey, when is
Sears Point this year?

912
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:06,285
You see that?

913
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,026
That's ol' Rick Nifty.

914
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,071
Rick Nifty.

915
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:13,814
He's an old buddy
of mine.

916
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:17,296
It ain't even legal,
I got him so panicked.

917
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:18,906
Only way that dude's
gonna see the finish

918
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:20,734
is to get in my draft.

919
00:54:20,779 --> 00:54:22,170
I'm gonna blow
that son of a bitch

920
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:23,737
right off the course.

921
00:54:23,782 --> 00:54:26,305
Hey, hold it, Halsy.He just better watch his ass.

922
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,872
You just better
watch yours, man.

923
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,308
What they ought to do
is to pay me extra

924
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:30,744
just for making it
interesting.

925
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:32,180
That's what these
square Johns want

926
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:33,921
is to see the real
muscle fighting it out.

927
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:35,575
Two top fast go-getters,

928
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,142
fighting it out
to the finish.

929
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:39,057
The World,
starring Halsy Knox.

930
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:40,928
How's that,
Lady Godiva?

931
00:54:40,973 --> 00:54:44,062
Hey, get that flag up there!

932
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:46,717
Hey, get it up!
Come on!

933
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:58,729
Go!

934
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:06,911
And there
they go into the first turn!

935
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:28,672
Now we've got
Fauss up front.

936
00:55:28,716 --> 00:55:31,588
Nifty's back in second place,
Fauss is up front.

937
00:55:31,632 --> 00:55:33,285
Nifty doesn't look
so nifty right now.

938
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,982
This could be an upset

939
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:36,810
because Nifty's not used
to running behind.

940
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:38,769
Boy, if this doesn't look
like the national--

941
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:43,034
Nifty's back
in the lead again!

942
00:55:43,078 --> 00:55:44,862
Look at him
charge there, folks!

943
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:46,254
Look at him go!

944
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:48,126
Whoa! And there goes Fauss!

945
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:52,783
Fauss gets
a California bath!

946
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,399
No Scott Roddy,
Rick Nifty,

947
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,009
Van Dusen,
Jim Dandy Sinclair's

948
00:56:02,054 --> 00:56:05,622
gonna lift his leg on me
and get away with it.

949
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,188
That bastard think
he's the only one

950
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:10,148
ever been up
to Sears Point?

951
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:12,455
When were you
at Sears, Hals?

952
00:56:12,499 --> 00:56:14,413
He don't know I wasn't
ever at Sears Point.

953
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:17,285
It rained the year
I was at Sears Point.

954
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:18,722
Drove all the way
up to 'Frisco,

955
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:21,289
got up there,
and it rained.

956
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:24,162
I heard they race
rain or shine up there.

957
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:27,470
Not during
earthquakes.

958
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:29,210
Oh.

959
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:32,431
Who couldn't
win a race?

960
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,128
You fly in in the morning,
you fly out at night,

961
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:37,784
you got the top tuners
working a top bike for you.

962
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:40,613
You carried your mad
into that race, Halsy,

963
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:42,267
which is
the dumbest thing, man,

964
00:56:42,311 --> 00:56:43,660
that anybody could do--

965
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:45,270
I gotta get me
a sponsor.

966
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:46,619
I gotta get me
a sponsor.

967
00:56:46,664 --> 00:56:48,273
And that's where
you goofed, you know?

968
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:49,622
Somebody who knows bikes,

969
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,189
much less throttle
return springs.

970
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:53,539
That throttle return spring
was perfect.

971
00:56:53,584 --> 00:56:55,193
Man, I couldn't
stop nowhere

972
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:57,195
on that Mickey Mouse
scooter of yours, Little.

973
00:56:57,239 --> 00:56:59,066
Hey, you missed
the trail, man.

974
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:01,678
Hey, you can't ride.
That's it, you know?

975
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,941
That's--
Yeah, you can't ride, man.

976
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:37,164
Hey, what, are you drinkin'
all the beer, ol' buddy?

977
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,550
Well, it's
on your side, dude.

978
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:18,510
Naturally.

979
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:40,967
Halsy?

980
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:44,623
What-ee?

981
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:46,799
What-ee?

982
00:59:49,411 --> 00:59:50,629
Never mind. What?

983
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:51,978
What's "what-ee"?

984
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:53,719
Never mind, damn it.
What do you want?

985
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:57,114
Didn't you ever say what-ee
when someone said your name?

986
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,294
I just want
to tell you something.

987
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:04,948
Okay, what?

988
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:09,343
What I was wondering was,
when your suspension's up?

989
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:10,867
What're you, homesick?
If you're homesick,

990
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:12,216
go home if you want.

991
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,873
No, I want my--

992
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:19,789
I want my bike back.
I want my license back.

993
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,747
And, uh...

994
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:23,793
I want to be
Little again, you know?

995
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:25,316
Sure, man, screw it.
Right away.

996
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,232
I don't give a damn.

997
01:00:28,276 --> 01:00:30,103
You don't have
to be dragged about it.

998
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:31,670
They'll cancel
my suspension.

999
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,020
I pay my dues anyway.
Don't worry about me.

1000
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:40,374
It's just my leg's better,
that's all.

1001
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:42,028
I'm not bugged.
Who says I'm bugged?

1002
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:57,565
Only to tell it true.

1003
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:00,438
It ain't your gimpy leg
you want to exercise.

1004
01:01:00,482 --> 01:01:03,876
I just want
to race is all.

1005
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,704
Sure, man, it's your bike,
you race it.

1006
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,488
Only don't tell me it's your
bike you want to race.

1007
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:08,881
Yeah, well,
what is it then?

1008
01:01:08,926 --> 01:01:10,622
It's the chick.

1009
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,363
Yeah, well, she ain't
your chick, you know that?

1010
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:13,930
She sure as hell
ain't your chick.

1011
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:15,540
Yeah, well, it was my idea
to bring her along.

1012
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:16,976
Whose truck is it?
Whose truck is it?

1013
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:18,935
It's your truck,
but it's my bike

1014
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:20,806
that's winning all the races to
pay for the food and the gas.

1015
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:22,721
Damn it, I'm trying to bust my
ass to score points for you

1016
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,636
and you're trying
to take my chick from me.

1017
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,769
You're trying to take
my chick from me, man.

1018
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:28,161
Anyway, you don't
want her none

1019
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:30,033
except maybe that
she ain't no whore.

1020
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:41,566
Well, if that's friendship,
I'm aghast.

1021
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,568
I never said I was
your friend, Halsy.

1022
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:45,483
I don't even
fucking like you.

1023
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:47,485
Oh, so he finally
blurts it out.

1024
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:48,965
I don't have to blurt it.

1025
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,314
I'm telling you
cold and clear, man,

1026
01:01:50,358 --> 01:01:51,837
I don't like you.
I never did.

1027
01:01:51,882 --> 01:01:53,883
And everything I had to
talk to you about, man,

1028
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:55,188
I had to think up.

1029
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,368
Hey, if we're gonna
settle this, Little,

1030
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:02,761
before I bust you
in the face,

1031
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:04,110
maybe we'd better
call out Rita

1032
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:05,677
and see how
she stands, huh?

1033
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:13,467
Hey!

1034
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,402
Ask her.

1035
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:12,211
Little, I got it.

1036
01:05:12,256 --> 01:05:13,865
Little, see, here it is.

1037
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,259
Like I told you, after you
left with Sideburns,

1038
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:18,130
I found this
in your room.

1039
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:21,829
See?
The photographer's camera.

1040
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:23,570
Why for all we know,

1041
01:05:23,615 --> 01:05:26,443
Sideburns could've committed
foul play to get this,

1042
01:05:26,487 --> 01:05:28,967
and they could've took you
as his accomplice.

1043
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:33,624
He don't have
to get rough, old Halsy.

1044
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:37,193
As long as nobody
ever steps up and says,

1045
01:05:37,237 --> 01:05:40,457
"Hey, man, you ain't
tellin' the truth."

1046
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:44,026
that's what he's got
going for him.

1047
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:48,508
As long as nobody
ever steps up and says,

1048
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:52,686
"Hey, that ain't
what you said yesterday."

1049
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:56,429
You know?

1050
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:01,739
Well, where--

1051
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,175
Where was--
What was I saying?

1052
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,090
Oh.

1053
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:12,054
I just as soon as died,

1054
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:16,754
and half the time
I thought I did already.

1055
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:21,150
and I'd hear conversations
with other bodies.

1056
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:24,544
"Are you dead?"
"Oh, yeah. Are you?"

1057
01:06:26,808 --> 01:06:32,030
And just when I knew
that I wasn't,

1058
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:35,077
they bored two holes
in my head and they was--

1059
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:37,035
They was pullin' my head
in one direction

1060
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,081
and my feet in another
and they was turnin' me over

1061
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:43,737
every half-hour like some
barbecued chicken on a spit.

1062
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:47,480
Just to keep my poor
old spine from sagging.

1063
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:49,700
People die
with broken backs.

1064
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,618
Usually people die,

1065
01:06:54,662 --> 01:06:59,579
but sometimes things happen
that aren't usual.

1066
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:01,712
I mean, a guy can fall off
a 12-story building

1067
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:03,192
and he don't die.

1068
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:05,063
I fall down five steps
and I break my neck.

1069
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:07,065
And all because
of some dumb broad

1070
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,501
named Bunny Patchen.

1071
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:10,808
I was hot,
and I was running

1072
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:12,375
from the bathroom
to the bedroom, you know,

1073
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:14,551
and I was-- It must've
been the excitement

1074
01:07:14,595 --> 01:07:16,074
of the big date and all,

1075
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:18,598
because I got
to feelin' kinda dizzy

1076
01:07:18,643 --> 01:07:20,731
and the next thing I know,
I'm fallin' down these stairs

1077
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:22,298
and then I'm--

1078
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:26,650
I'm in the intensive care
on that spit,

1079
01:07:26,694 --> 01:07:28,347
and then a body cast for--

1080
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:32,047
I was in a body cast
for three months.

1081
01:07:33,919 --> 01:07:35,528
And all I get
from ol' Bunny Patchen is

1082
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:37,878
this get well card saying,
"Oh, I'm sorry, Halsy.

1083
01:07:37,923 --> 01:07:39,271
"It just can't work out
between us

1084
01:07:39,316 --> 01:07:41,099
"due to the fact
of all the things

1085
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:43,449
you place so much
importance on and I don't."

1086
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,147
Yeah, I know.

1087
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:46,626
Same thing
happened to me--

1088
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:48,280
No, it didn't happen
to you, damn it!

1089
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:49,977
Now, it happened to me!
It didn't happen to you!

1090
01:07:50,022 --> 01:07:52,632
What I mean is you're looking
to be responded to.

1091
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:53,938
Aw, bullshit.

1092
01:07:53,982 --> 01:07:55,418
It's not called bullshit.

1093
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,594
It's called moving
off your center.

1094
01:07:57,638 --> 01:07:59,074
If I told you
I was being tortured

1095
01:07:59,118 --> 01:08:00,423
by wild Persian tribes

1096
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:01,946
while I was travelin'
around the world

1097
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,904
for the FBI,
you'd listen to me,

1098
01:08:03,949 --> 01:08:05,428
but I told you the truth,
and you wasn't listenin'.

1099
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:06,864
You wasn't listenin'.

1100
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:08,953
So, what good is
the truth?

1101
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:20,225
To the right!

1102
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:43,466
...crosses the line, folks.

1103
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,076
Unofficially,
here is the results.

1104
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,773
First was Ken Loman,
second was Merle Fromm,

1105
01:08:46,818 --> 01:08:48,384
third, Don Dobbins,

1106
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:50,734
and just out of the money,
Halsy Knox.

1107
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,409
You asked me
where my Mars was.

1108
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:14,845
You kept on buggin' me
about my Mars,

1109
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:16,412
and I tell you
where my Mars is,

1110
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:17,848
and now you come up with
"Where's my Venus?"

1111
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:19,502
Shh! Please, be quiet.

1112
01:09:19,546 --> 01:09:21,634
What's the matter?
Am I makin' it nervous?

1113
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,854
Well, you're moving me
very much off my center.

1114
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:25,247
Aw, hey, babe, I don't know
about your center.

1115
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:26,639
I don't know
where your center is,

1116
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:27,945
I don't know
where my planets are,

1117
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:29,512
I just know we're broke.

1118
01:09:29,556 --> 01:09:30,948
And unless you come up
with something here today

1119
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:32,210
besides these bottle caps
and pennies,

1120
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,212
I'm gonna hock this toy.

1121
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:36,867
You hock your own toy, sonny.
You don't hock mine.

1122
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,260
Hey, wait a minute.

1123
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:40,523
You mean hock my bike?

1124
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:42,177
Hmm?

1125
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:45,615
You haven't made dime one
since you went 100 percent.

1126
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:47,834
I think that ought
to tell you something.

1127
01:09:47,879 --> 01:09:50,228
What? Okay, what ought
to tell me what?

1128
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:53,013
You need Little.

1129
01:10:09,335 --> 01:10:11,771
You did it! Ha-ha!

1130
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:13,904
Little! Little!

1131
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:16,167
Little!
Whoo-hoo, Little!

1132
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:20,171
That's your
best time yet, son.

1133
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,955
You broke your own record.

1134
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,436
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you

1135
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:25,916
and your flag, Ma.

1136
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,005
Oh, you!
I'll get you!

1137
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:31,182
Get away from me,
Little.

1138
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,749
I'm gonna get you,
Little!

1139
01:10:32,793 --> 01:10:34,533
Hey, come on, Ma.
That's okay, Ma.

1140
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:35,839
You shouldn't--

1141
01:10:35,883 --> 01:10:38,276
Hey, Ma,
quit fooling around!

1142
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:39,712
You get down from there!

1143
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:42,802
Hey.

1144
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,353
Well, howdy, folks.
How ya doing?

1145
01:11:11,397 --> 01:11:14,486
Ma'am, how are you?

1146
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,009
How's about a body
gettin' some gas

1147
01:11:16,054 --> 01:11:17,707
for a broke-down truck
up the road?

1148
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,492
You sure got
a lot of nerve

1149
01:11:20,537 --> 01:11:22,320
coming out here
on an empty tank.

1150
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:26,716
Oh, man.
Hey, you may let me starve,

1151
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,154
but you ain't about to let
no motor go hungry.

1152
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:44,603
How's your old man?

1153
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:47,519
He's dead.

1154
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,957
Oh.

1155
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:56,702
Oh.

1156
01:11:56,747 --> 01:11:58,965
I'm-- I'm sure sorry
to hear that.

1157
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:01,925
I was genuinely fond
of the old gentleman.

1158
01:12:01,969 --> 01:12:05,320
That's more than he had
to say for you, man.

1159
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:08,410
No, I'm...

1160
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:09,933
I am much shocked

1161
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,196
to hear of his
untimely domain.

1162
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:40,355
How the hell
are you, buddy?

1163
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,921
What is it you want,
Halsy?

1164
01:12:41,966 --> 01:12:44,533
Aw, you're mean,
Little.

1165
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:45,969
Now, you don't
respond to people.

1166
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:47,797
Now, damn it,
that's a bad trait.

1167
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:51,235
People want
to be responded to.

1168
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:52,628
Looky here, I gotta
bend over backwards

1169
01:12:52,672 --> 01:12:54,760
just to catch
your eyes.

1170
01:12:58,504 --> 01:13:00,418
I was saying
to Rita this morning,

1171
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:02,638
boy, this reunion
with ol' Little,

1172
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:04,944
that's gonna be a tough one,
but, damn it, worth it.

1173
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:22,440
Hi, Rita.
How are you?

1174
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:25,269
I'm fine, Little.
How are you?

1175
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:26,705
I'm fine, too,
thank you.

1176
01:13:35,062 --> 01:13:36,802
When'd you get that?

1177
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:39,065
I wondered when the heck
you were gonna notice.

1178
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:43,722
Ridin' sidehack now, huh?
Who with?

1179
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:46,856
Well, ol' Jimmy Fast
got killed

1180
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,945
up at Corriganville,
and his wife said,

1181
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:50,512
"Here, take it."

1182
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:52,949
Said she never wanted
to see it again.

1183
01:13:52,993 --> 01:13:55,647
How's Herrera?

1184
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:58,868
I gave him Rita's
Geiger counter for his half.

1185
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:01,305
No, I mean how is he?

1186
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:04,874
Oh, he's great
except he's got no nose.

1187
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:07,398
Well, uh...

1188
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,661
Who you ridin'
sidehack with?

1189
01:14:09,706 --> 01:14:13,056
Well, now, I truly hoped
that it was gonna be

1190
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,972
my old friend,
Little Fauss.

1191
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:19,105
Hey, you might tell him
half that thing's mine.

1192
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,717
You know, my Geiger counter
paid for it.

1193
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:46,916
Yeah, we couldn't
hustle up enough loot

1194
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,874
to hustle up
a doctor soon enough,

1195
01:14:48,919 --> 01:14:50,267
and now it's too late.

1196
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:53,662
And, hell, I'd marry
her like that,

1197
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:55,185
except they just
caught up with me

1198
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:56,708
for not supporting
one family, and, hell,

1199
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:58,231
I don't even know
if I'm divorced yet.

1200
01:14:58,276 --> 01:14:59,929
Hell, you know me.
I'm not the kinda guy

1201
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:02,105
who can just cut out
on some girl.

1202
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:05,151
And, well, so, remembering
how much in love

1203
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:06,805
that you two were,
I just kinda figured

1204
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,720
I'd maybe just step
right outta your ways

1205
01:15:08,765 --> 01:15:10,113
if you thought you might
wanna get together

1206
01:15:10,157 --> 01:15:13,420
and team up again,
get something going.

1207
01:15:13,465 --> 01:15:14,987
You mean come back
and be your tuner

1208
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:18,251
and take a shot at Rita
every once in a while, right?

1209
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:22,734
Well, you have
a low mind, Little.

1210
01:15:22,779 --> 01:15:24,954
You just wanna pawn
that chick off on me, man.

1211
01:15:24,998 --> 01:15:26,738
I figured you'd
think that.

1212
01:15:26,783 --> 01:15:29,262
Yeah, well, that's
how it is, right?

1213
01:15:29,307 --> 01:15:31,700
Hey, I don't even know
if it's my kid!

1214
01:15:35,182 --> 01:15:37,836
Sure, for all I know,
it may even be your kid.

1215
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,927
Yes, sir.Aw, man...

1216
01:15:41,972 --> 01:15:45,757
Man, she can't even
tell me whose kid it is!

1217
01:15:45,802 --> 01:15:48,107
It'd just break my heart
to give up poor Rita,

1218
01:15:48,152 --> 01:15:50,370
but if that's
what I gotta do...

1219
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:53,809
It'd be just like
old times, remember?

1220
01:15:53,853 --> 01:15:55,637
Lots of laughs,
plenty of ass?

1221
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,073
What do you say, babe?

1222
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:04,863
I ain't a tuner anymore.
I race.

1223
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,910
I want you to race.

1224
01:16:07,954 --> 01:16:10,652
That's what I'm here for.
I need you to sidehack for me.

1225
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,697
Halsy, I ain't climbing
on no sidehack

1226
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:14,351
to hold you down.

1227
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:16,353
I race solo 100 percent.

1228
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:22,533
She's havin' a baby, man,

1229
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,491
and I don't have a dime.

1230
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:28,583
I'm goin' to San Francisco.

1231
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,544
Sears Point?That's all I'm gonna do.

1232
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,937
I ain't ridin'
sidehack no more.

1233
01:16:34,981 --> 01:16:36,895
I ain't gettin'
screwed up.

1234
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:40,638
I'm just goin' to Sears Point
to race and screw people.

1235
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:42,744
Hey.

1236
01:17:42,788 --> 01:17:44,093
Yeah?

1237
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,057
Well?

1238
01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:57,497
I make it a rule

1239
01:17:57,542 --> 01:18:00,283
never to make
no promises.

1240
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:01,850
So?

1241
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,115
I just want you
to know, though, that--

1242
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:08,073
That you can
count on me.

1243
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:11,468
I make it a rule...

1244
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:13,513
never to count
on anybody.

1245
01:18:15,429 --> 01:18:16,865
Good...

1246
01:18:16,909 --> 01:18:18,649
then maybe
we'll get along.

1247
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,821
Next rider up
will be number 62,

1248
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:01,431
Red Perkins
on a Harley-Davidson.

1249
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:03,955
There they go.
He's off for a good run.

1250
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,870
Halfway up now,
and look-- Oh!

1251
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:07,654
And up and over and another

1252
01:19:07,699 --> 01:19:08,960
of the slide riders
didn't make it there

1253
01:19:09,005 --> 01:19:10,745
as he slides back down.

1254
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:12,572
And the next rider'll be
one of the Tulsa riders--

1255
01:19:12,617 --> 01:19:14,139
number 8 junior...

1256
01:19:14,184 --> 01:19:15,793
Well, it doesn't make
any difference there.

1257
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:17,490
Uh, only his pride,

1258
01:19:17,535 --> 01:19:19,101
maybe his butt
got hurt there. He's okay.

1259
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:20,537
Rita?

1260
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:23,061
And the next rider
up will be one

1261
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:25,411
of the local favorites,
Little Fauss on, uh,

1262
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,196
number 191 on his Yamaha.

1263
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,937
He's set to go.

1264
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:30,982
There he goes, and it
looks like a good run...

1265
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:40,600
Ohh, Little...

1266
01:19:46,651 --> 01:19:48,870
Oh, whatever happened to...

1267
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:58,227
Whatever happened to...
Ohh...

1268
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:07,889
Whatever ha-happened to...

1269
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,586
...Halsy?

1270
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:15,331
Ohh...

1271
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:18,595
He knocked up some whore

1272
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,598
there a while back

1273
01:20:21,642 --> 01:20:22,991
and, well,

1274
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:26,472
he probably had to
get married by now.

1275
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,263
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
We did it, baby!

1276
01:20:34,307 --> 01:20:35,960
Ahh. Hey! Whoo!

1277
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:38,615
Just shut up
and hurry up!

1278
01:20:38,659 --> 01:20:40,878
How we doin'? Easy.

1279
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:43,533
Ohh! We got plenty
of time. Hold on.

1280
01:20:43,577 --> 01:20:45,361
Halsy, first aid
and a big smile

1281
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:47,537
is not gonna
get me through this.

1282
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:49,626
What a prima donna.

1283
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:50,975
You're supposed
to exercise...

1284
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,021
I got you, baby.

1285
01:20:53,065 --> 01:20:55,153
You're supposed
to exercise and eat

1286
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:56,589
and take breathing lessons,

1287
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:58,243
and I didn't do
any of it!

1288
01:20:58,288 --> 01:21:00,419
Put that baby out there,
huh? We're comin'.

1289
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:08,123
I got you, now.
Just take it easy.

1290
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:09,951
Hey, Halsy, you ain't
gonna win this race!

1291
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,691
Huh? Well, who the hell
are you, smart ass?

1292
01:21:11,736 --> 01:21:13,780
How come
I didn't see you?

1293
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:15,695
I didn't see you 'cause you
was behind me, that's why.

1294
01:21:18,743 --> 01:21:21,005
Easy now.
Ohh!

1295
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,311
What the hell
were you ridin' in?

1296
01:21:22,355 --> 01:21:24,139
Take it easy, will you?

1297
01:21:24,183 --> 01:21:26,097
I got the leg,
I got the leg.

1298
01:21:26,142 --> 01:21:27,882
Where's my helmet?

1299
01:21:27,926 --> 01:21:29,274
We'll have you
there in a jiffy.

1300
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:30,754
Throw me that helmet,
will you, Jay?

1301
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:32,451
Come on,
I gotta get movin'.

1302
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:34,540
Hey, wait a minute.

1303
01:21:34,585 --> 01:21:36,499
Easy.
I got it.

1304
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:38,283
Right with you,
baby.

1305
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:41,417
Okay, Mac, go ahead.

1306
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:49,164
I want somebody
to call my father.

1307
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:51,383
No one needs to call
your father, baby.

1308
01:21:51,428 --> 01:21:52,994
I'm right here.

1309
01:21:53,038 --> 01:21:54,952
I'm your father.

1310
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:58,695
If we--
If we go to 'Frisco--

1311
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,175
That's where they live.

1312
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:01,959
I could call them
and blow their minds.

1313
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:03,700
Oh, we're
gonna go to 'Frisco, baby,

1314
01:22:03,744 --> 01:22:05,006
and we're gonna blow
your old man's mind,

1315
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,051
and I'm gonna win
the old 200.

1316
01:22:08,662 --> 01:22:10,185
Community hospital.

1317
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:11,969
Can I help you?

1318
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,364
Mr. Knox.

1319
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:19,585
Are you Mr. Knox?

1320
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:21,152
What-- Huh?

1321
01:22:21,197 --> 01:22:23,633
What? Uh-huh. Why?

1322
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:25,765
Congratulations. It's
a healthy 6-pound baby girl.

1323
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,115
What? Huh?

1324
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:28,464
Your wife,
Miss Nebraska.

1325
01:22:28,508 --> 01:22:29,726
Yeah?

1326
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,423
She's asking
to see you,

1327
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:34,470
if you haven't,
heh-heh, "split."

1328
01:23:17,644 --> 01:23:19,297
You guys! You can't
even say goodbye

1329
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:20,951
and thank you!

1330
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,909
I was gonna say goodbye
and thank you, Moneth,

1331
01:23:22,954 --> 01:23:25,869
but I thought I'd let
you get your beauty sleep.

1332
01:23:25,913 --> 01:23:27,784
Yeah, well, if you see
your boyfriend down there,

1333
01:23:27,828 --> 01:23:30,917
you sure tell him he taught you
all the wrong things!

1334
01:23:30,962 --> 01:23:32,963
'Cause you two sure like
to leave a girl high and dry,

1335
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,312
you know that?

1336
01:23:34,357 --> 01:23:36,010
Could be you, Moneth,
you know that?

1337
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:38,577
Who, me?And, uh,

1338
01:23:38,622 --> 01:23:40,318
don't you
"you guys" me,

1339
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:41,580
'cause I'm me.

1340
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:44,670
Yeah, well, maybe
you used to be,

1341
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:46,803
but you sure ain't anymore,
you know that, Little?

1342
01:23:46,847 --> 01:23:48,892
'Cause Halsy and I ain't
even friends anymore,

1343
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:51,460
much less what you say,
boyfriends.

1344
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,507
Can't you just...

1345
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:57,553
Please...

1346
01:23:57,597 --> 01:23:59,642
say goodbye?

1347
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:03,515
Goodbye, Moneth.

1348
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,431
"Sears Point,
you big-time beguiler,

They'll
never print that.

1361
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:32,109
Oh, they printed
all them stories

1362
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:33,589
and articles
on how I cycled

1363
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:35,504
through South America.

1364
01:24:35,548 --> 01:24:37,506
In-juh. In-juh.
Huh?

1365
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:38,942
You told me
it was India

1366
01:24:38,986 --> 01:24:40,683
you cycled through,
not South America.

1367
01:24:40,727 --> 01:24:42,337
Did I say India?
Oh, that's right! It was.

1368
01:24:42,381 --> 01:24:43,773
That's right.
It was India.

1369
01:24:43,817 --> 01:24:46,384
Turkey and Turkistan,
all them places.

1370
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:49,866
Burma...

1371
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:51,215
There's the fuzz.

1372
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,565
Fuzz is here!
Everybody's here!

1373
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:56,133
God,
that is beautiful.

1374
01:24:56,178 --> 01:24:57,874
Yeah, it sure is.

1375
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,646
Is he here?

1376
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:58,995
Huh?
Is he here?

1377
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:01,171
Who?Mmm...

1378
01:27:02,695 --> 01:27:05,393
Hey...

1379
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:07,090
All I'm lookin' for
out of this

1380
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:09,223
is a factory contract.

1381
01:27:10,877 --> 01:27:13,139
I'm just tired.
I'm tired of leaning

1382
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:14,880
on dealers
all over the country

1383
01:27:14,925 --> 01:27:17,143
to ride them name brands
in every fairground

1384
01:27:17,188 --> 01:27:20,016
and county fairs
all over the country.

1385
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:21,539
Just to get
on some factory team

1386
01:27:21,584 --> 01:27:24,150
at 40 or $60,000 a year.

1387
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:28,111
That's all Sears Point
means to me.

1388
01:27:28,155 --> 01:27:29,939
High dealer wins. It's my beer,
it's my house.

1389
01:27:29,983 --> 01:27:31,549
We're gonna be here all night.

1390
01:27:31,594 --> 01:27:32,942
All right,
come on. Let's go.

1391
01:27:32,986 --> 01:27:34,857
Come on, Halsy.
Deal 'em.

1392
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:36,815
I have Frank up.
Come on, Frank. Come up.

1393
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,077
All right, well,
let's go.

1394
01:27:38,122 --> 01:27:39,296
I'm in. A quarter.

1395
01:27:39,341 --> 01:27:40,906
Everybody in?
Yep.

1396
01:27:40,951 --> 01:27:42,647
Oh, my God.
I thought we were bein' raided.

1397
01:27:42,692 --> 01:27:44,693
Hey, is poker legal
in California or what?

1398
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:46,129
Lock the door,
will you, babe?

1399
01:27:46,173 --> 01:27:49,350
I ran into an old friend
of yours downstairs.

1400
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:51,308
Who?

1401
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:53,267
I asked him to come up.

1402
01:28:02,973 --> 01:28:04,713
Well, if it ain't Little Fauss,

1403
01:28:04,757 --> 01:28:06,454
my old tuner. Good deal.

1404
01:28:07,543 --> 01:28:08,891
How are you?

1405
01:28:08,935 --> 01:28:10,762
Come on in.
Grab a chair.

1406
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:12,242
This is a hell
of a time for a raid,

1407
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,939
into me for 10 bucks.Who's into who?

1408
01:28:13,984 --> 01:28:16,855
Somebody's into somebody.
You want a beer?

1409
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,248
You know Rita?
Oh, yeah, you met. You--

1410
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:19,728
You seen our kid?

1411
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:21,338
Yeah, you got
a nice baby.

1412
01:28:21,383 --> 01:28:22,948
Thank you. Well,
how do you know, man?

1413
01:28:22,993 --> 01:28:26,125
You haven't even seen her.
She's over here.

1414
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,171
I seen her when your old lady
dragged me up here.

1415
01:28:28,215 --> 01:28:29,781
Yeah, there's nothin'
like a kid in the world.

1416
01:28:29,826 --> 01:28:32,349
Nothin' like a kid.MAN: You playin' or not?

1417
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:34,177
Yeah. Hell, I'm in.

1418
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:35,787
For cryin' out loud--MAN 2: Get in or get out.

1419
01:28:35,832 --> 01:28:37,572
So you're in
Cockroach Manor, too, huh?

1420
01:28:37,616 --> 01:28:40,662
That's what I call
this place, Cockroach Manor.

1421
01:28:40,706 --> 01:28:41,924
It's ritzy enough for me.

1422
01:28:41,968 --> 01:28:43,708
Huh?

1423
01:28:43,753 --> 01:28:44,970
What?

1424
01:28:45,015 --> 01:28:47,103
Ritzy enough for me.

1425
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:49,758
Oh, no, man,
I'm only kiddin'.

1426
01:28:49,802 --> 01:28:51,629
Sure, it's beautiful.

1427
01:28:51,674 --> 01:28:55,372
TV...

1428
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:57,243
You're only in San Francisco
once, I always say,

1429
01:28:57,288 --> 01:28:59,420
and all my friends are here.

1430
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,291
Well, I better
get some sleep

1431
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:02,945
if I wanna get
some practice laps in

1432
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:05,556
in the morning.

1433
01:29:05,601 --> 01:29:08,254
Yeah, man. Sure.

1434
01:29:08,299 --> 01:29:09,647
You better get some sleep.

1435
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:11,170
How are you?

1436
01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:12,781
I'll go 2 bucks
just to get you out--

1437
01:29:12,825 --> 01:29:14,522
- Two bucks. Okay.
- I'll see you for 2.

1438
01:29:14,566 --> 01:29:17,351
Me, I do all my partying
before the race.

1439
01:29:17,395 --> 01:29:19,135
Then I'm so hung over
all's I wanna do

1440
01:29:19,179 --> 01:29:21,659
is get that race over.

1441
01:29:21,704 --> 01:29:23,182
And damned if I don't
race better just trying

1442
01:29:23,227 --> 01:29:25,228
to get that race over
and back on the road.

1443
01:29:25,272 --> 01:29:26,621
I'll, uh,
raise you half.

1444
01:29:26,665 --> 01:29:28,623
You look for another
greasy spoon, right?

1445
01:29:28,667 --> 01:29:31,713
I'm gonna call,
but gimme a hole card.

1446
01:29:31,757 --> 01:29:35,238
You don't think big, Little,
and that's your problem.

1447
01:29:35,282 --> 01:29:37,762
Probably from racin'
in dirt too much.

1448
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:39,242
No more suckin'
around for tires

1449
01:29:39,286 --> 01:29:41,418
and candy-assin'
spark plugs for me, babe.

1450
01:29:41,463 --> 01:29:43,028
No, sir.

1451
01:29:43,073 --> 01:29:45,640
One year in
the national circuit, then out!

1452
01:29:45,684 --> 01:29:47,250
Out while I'm on top.

1453
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:49,992
Go on TV as a famous
sports celebrity.

1454
01:29:50,036 --> 01:29:51,515
Racing ain't the only way
to make money.

1455
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:52,821
The dealer folds.

1456
01:29:52,865 --> 01:29:54,736
Best of luck to you.

1457
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,259
Yeah, I was even
sayin' to ol' Rita,

1458
01:29:56,303 --> 01:29:58,740
I thought we might go up
and visit her folks and...

1459
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:02,004
kinda make 'em
feel good.

1460
01:30:02,048 --> 01:30:03,571
You have a kind heart,
you know that?

1461
01:30:03,615 --> 01:30:05,050
All right, come on.

1462
01:30:05,095 --> 01:30:06,487
Deal 'em, man.
Let's go, will you?

1463
01:30:06,531 --> 01:30:08,097
Hey, it's not my deal,
damn it.

1464
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:10,012
Whose deal is it,
anyway?

1465
01:30:10,056 --> 01:30:12,406
I ain't runnin'
a casino around here.

1466
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:15,583
How's she supposed
to get any sleep?

1467
01:30:15,627 --> 01:30:16,932
Somebody grab the pot.

1468
01:30:16,976 --> 01:30:18,368
Yeah.

1469
01:30:19,631 --> 01:30:22,285
Let's get some beer.

1470
01:30:22,329 --> 01:30:23,591
See you later, Hoss.

1471
01:30:23,635 --> 01:30:24,940
Halsy.

1472
01:30:24,984 --> 01:30:26,202
It's Halsy, man!

1473
01:30:26,246 --> 01:30:27,986
Later, man.

1474
01:30:28,031 --> 01:30:29,379
See you later, man.

1475
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:38,519
How you doin', Rita?

1476
01:30:38,563 --> 01:30:40,259
I'm doin' good, Little.
How are you doin'?

1477
01:30:40,304 --> 01:30:41,913
All right.That's good. What's happenin'?

1478
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,437
Draft board's got me.

1479
01:30:44,743 --> 01:30:46,178
Thought you said
you had to go home

1480
01:30:46,223 --> 01:30:47,702
and get some sleep,
Little.

1481
01:30:47,746 --> 01:30:50,531
Draft board's got me.
I got drafted.

1482
01:30:53,099 --> 01:30:54,491
Crash your bike, man.

1483
01:30:54,536 --> 01:30:56,058
Get reclassified.

1484
01:30:56,102 --> 01:30:58,147
You mean, uh,

1485
01:30:58,191 --> 01:31:00,628
hurt myself on purpose?

1486
01:31:00,672 --> 01:31:02,717
That's what I done.

1487
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:04,762
Well, I don't
feature that.

1488
01:31:04,807 --> 01:31:06,460
I don't feature that.

1489
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:10,507
Ohh...

1490
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,905
Except when you go to wreck
yourself a little,

1491
01:31:16,949 --> 01:31:20,082
you end up wreckin'
yourself a lot.

1492
01:31:26,306 --> 01:31:28,351
Operator.Operator, uh,

1493
01:31:28,395 --> 01:31:29,918
I'd like to make
a long-distance call

1494
01:31:29,962 --> 01:31:31,441
to Pebble Beach,
California.

1495
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,008
What's the party's name?

1496
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:34,879
Uh, to the country club. Do you have the number?

1497
01:31:34,924 --> 01:31:36,228
No, I don't
know the number.

1498
01:31:36,273 --> 01:31:37,621
And that's person-to-person

1499
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:40,058
to Mr. and Mrs. Jack Nebraska.

1500
01:31:40,103 --> 01:31:42,452
That'll be 75 cents,
please.

1501
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,845
Okay.

1502
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:52,027
Twenty-five cents more, please.

1503
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:54,377
Just a minute.
I'm coming up with it.

1504
01:31:57,076 --> 01:31:58,337
Thank you.

1505
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:04,474
Hello. Who is it?It's Rita.

1506
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,432
Look, would you speak up?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

1507
01:32:06,477 --> 01:32:08,826
We got a bad connection here.
Who is it?

1508
01:32:08,871 --> 01:32:10,611
Rita!

1509
01:32:48,388 --> 01:32:50,389
She's gone.

1510
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:52,696
Who?

1511
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,788
Aw, hell,
who do you think, man? Rita.

1512
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,703
She cut. Split.

1513
01:33:02,228 --> 01:33:04,012
She's not with me.

1514
01:33:04,056 --> 01:33:05,883
Oh, now, I know she's
not with you, man.

1515
01:33:05,928 --> 01:33:07,276
What's she gonna do
with you?

1516
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,365
She cut out on me.

1517
01:33:09,409 --> 01:33:11,149
She didn't
even say goodbye?

1518
01:33:11,194 --> 01:33:12,411
Oh, come on.

1519
01:33:12,456 --> 01:33:14,718
Who cares?
Screw her.

1520
01:33:14,763 --> 01:33:16,328
Once a whore,
always a whore.

1521
01:33:20,116 --> 01:33:21,856
Hey, what do you say
to something to eat?

1522
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:23,422
Let's get something
to eat. How 'bout it?

1523
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:24,859
Some greasy spoon
up there.

1524
01:33:24,903 --> 01:33:26,208
Come on!I already ate.

1525
01:33:26,252 --> 01:33:27,644
Come on, have a cup
of coffee with me.

1526
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:29,603
I had coffee, too.Oh, well, then have a crumb.

1527
01:33:29,647 --> 01:33:31,039
Hell,
have a toothpick.

1528
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:32,823
Come on, watch me
eat. Come on.

1529
01:33:34,565 --> 01:33:37,741
I turned down Suzuki,
did I tell you?

1530
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:39,221
Good for you.

1531
01:33:39,265 --> 01:33:40,744
I told them to take
their contract

1532
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:42,311
and shove it.

1533
01:33:42,355 --> 01:33:44,792
Ain't nobody gonna run
my life like that, man.

1534
01:33:44,836 --> 01:33:47,359
All right.

1535
01:33:47,404 --> 01:33:50,493
Sponsorship
is nowhere, man.

1536
01:33:50,537 --> 01:33:51,929
Politics.

1537
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:54,323
That's right.

1538
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,676
I had--

1539
01:33:59,721 --> 01:34:02,723
I had this offer
to go race in Europe?

1540
01:34:02,767 --> 01:34:04,115
Uh-huh.

1541
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,117
I had to turn it down

1542
01:34:06,162 --> 01:34:07,597
because of Rita
and the kid.

1543
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:09,338
Shit.

1544
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:13,168
You didn't have
no offers, Halsy.

1545
01:34:13,212 --> 01:34:15,257
Hey, ma'am, can I
have some coffee?

1546
01:34:17,434 --> 01:34:19,261
What a day for her
to leave on, huh?

1547
01:34:19,305 --> 01:34:21,611
Ohh! Oh, no.

1548
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,308
If a chick's gonna go,
she's gonna go

1549
01:34:23,353 --> 01:34:25,180
on your birthday
or on Christmas Eve.

1550
01:34:25,224 --> 01:34:28,270
They got their timin' down!
They know just when to cut you.

1551
01:34:28,314 --> 01:34:30,054
How's it goin', Halsy?Hey, what do ya say, babe?

1552
01:34:30,099 --> 01:34:31,360
What do you know?
You hot today?

1553
01:34:31,404 --> 01:34:32,753
Yeah!

1554
01:34:32,797 --> 01:34:34,842
'Frisco.
We made it, didn't we?

1555
01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:40,282
It ain't how you do, babe.

1556
01:34:40,326 --> 01:34:42,763
It's where you been.
Ain't you learned that yet?

1557
01:34:44,809 --> 01:34:46,505
It's how you do, Halsy.

1558
01:34:48,465 --> 01:34:50,422
With the temperature here

1559
01:34:50,467 --> 01:34:52,337
on the track at 111 degrees
and under a cloudless sky,

1560
01:34:52,382 --> 01:34:53,991
the North American
Grand Prix,

1561
01:34:54,036 --> 01:34:55,993
and already we have
the largest crowd

1562
01:34:56,038 --> 01:34:58,343
to ever witness a professional
motorcycle road race,

1563
01:34:58,388 --> 01:35:00,824
and we have people spaced
all over this racetrack

1564
01:35:00,869 --> 01:35:02,434
high on the hillsides

1565
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:04,262
at the north edge
of San Francisco Bay

1566
01:35:04,307 --> 01:35:06,787
here at beautiful Sears Point
International Raceway.

1567
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,745
With the start
getting underway

1568
01:35:08,790 --> 01:35:11,400
in just a few moments,
the factory teams doing battle

1569
01:35:11,444 --> 01:35:13,489
for the final time
this season...

1570
01:35:15,797 --> 01:35:17,449
And the starter flag,
and we're off...

1571
01:35:30,289 --> 01:35:33,465
The most challenging course
in the United States.

1572
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:35,076
Still taking the lead is
Cal Rayburn,

1573
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:36,947
number 25
on the Chief Harley-Davidson

1574
01:35:36,992 --> 01:35:39,341
from San Diego.
He's the pre-race favorite

1575
01:35:39,385 --> 01:35:41,952
along with Duhamel
on the Yamaha from Canada

1576
01:35:41,997 --> 01:35:44,215
and Art Bauman from
San Francisco on the Suzuki,

1577
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:46,957
looking for his first
championship road race win.

1578
01:35:52,268 --> 01:35:55,313
Checking the back of the pack,
we've got a duel going between

1579
01:35:55,358 --> 01:35:57,141
two of the unknown
first-time entries here.

1580
01:35:57,186 --> 01:35:58,708
It's number 10 Halsy Knox

1581
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,318
and number 58 Little Fauss.

1582
01:36:00,363 --> 01:36:02,843
Incidentally, Fauss was
a former tuner for Knox,

1583
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:04,801
and they're really
seesawing it back and forth.

1584
01:36:04,846 --> 01:36:07,282
With number 58 Fauss
on the inside there,

1585
01:36:07,326 --> 01:36:08,979
getting up to about
a half a bike length.

1586
01:36:09,024 --> 01:36:11,155
But, wait a minute,
back comes number 10 Knox,

1587
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,505
and they're seesawing it
back and forth there

1588
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:15,116
through the turns,
and they should come

1589
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,813
down the front straightaway
side by side,

1590
01:36:16,858 --> 01:36:18,728
and we'll find out
who's got that horsepower.

1591
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,035
But wait a minute,
approaching turn seven there,

1592
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:23,124
number 10 Knox
starts to stretch it out

1593
01:36:23,168 --> 01:36:24,908
as he moves by off of nine.

1594
01:36:24,953 --> 01:36:27,432
He's out about one length.
He gets up to two,

1595
01:36:27,477 --> 01:36:29,913
and apparently 10,
Knox has broken that duel

1596
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:31,393
and is starting to move up.

1597
01:36:34,136 --> 01:36:36,833
There he goes
from fifth to fourth

1598
01:36:36,878 --> 01:36:38,443
as they come
down that front straightaway

1599
01:36:38,488 --> 01:36:40,663
around that bend,
and he's got the lead.

1600
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:46,016
Number 10 Halsy Knox
apparently is coming up

1601
01:36:46,061 --> 01:36:48,932
with some trouble there.
He's slowing down.

1602
01:36:48,977 --> 01:36:51,587
Once again we notice back
in the pack is number 58,

1603
01:36:51,631 --> 01:36:53,284
a first-timer, Little Fauss.

1604
01:36:53,329 --> 01:36:54,982
Now he's starting to put
the pressure on

1605
01:36:55,026 --> 01:36:57,462
as he works his way by
Ron Hurtle on the Kawasaki,

1606
01:36:57,507 --> 01:36:59,116
and he goes up to eight.

1607
01:36:59,161 --> 01:37:00,944
And across
the straightaway area we come,

1608
01:37:00,989 --> 01:37:02,685
and we've got
a brand new duel going

1609
01:37:02,729 --> 01:37:05,383
with Little Fauss,
number 58 from Oklahoma.

1610
01:37:05,428 --> 01:37:07,255
Fauss again, and he picks up
another position.

1611
01:37:07,299 --> 01:37:08,822
He's running seventh.

1612
01:37:08,866 --> 01:37:10,214
Up to sixth he goes.

1613
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:11,825
There he goes past
Merle Freeman

1614
01:37:11,869 --> 01:37:13,304
on the BSA. Into fourth

1615
01:37:13,349 --> 01:37:14,784
as they come down
the front straightaway

1616
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:16,177
and around the bend.

1617
01:37:16,221 --> 01:37:18,005
And he's
in third position now,

1618
01:37:18,049 --> 01:37:19,789
getting ready to take a shot
at the big boys up front

1619
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,443
with only ten laps to go.

1620
01:37:21,487 --> 01:37:23,575
If Fauss can continue
the pace,

1621
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:25,012
we could have an upset
this afternoon

1622
01:37:25,056 --> 01:37:26,448
here at Sears Point.

1623
01:37:26,492 --> 01:37:28,450
So keep your eyes
on number 58,

1624
01:37:28,494 --> 01:37:30,060
Little Fauss from Oklahoma.

1625
01:37:30,105 --> 01:37:31,627
...with only 10 laps to go.

1626
01:37:31,671 --> 01:37:33,107
If Fauss can continue
the pace,

1627
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:34,804
we could have an upset
this afternoon

1628
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:37,328
here at Sears Point.
So keep your eyes..

1629
01:37:37,373 --> 01:37:38,982
Keep your eyes...
Number 58...

1630
01:37:39,027 --> 01:37:40,679
Little Fauss from Oklahoma...
Little Fauss...

1631
01:37:40,724 --> 01:37:41,985
So, keep your eyes on...
Keep your eyes on...
