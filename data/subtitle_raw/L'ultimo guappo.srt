1
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,934
What's happening?

2
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:43,669
Stop it, would you?

3
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:45,809
I do not want fights
at the market,

4
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,895
here we buy and sell honestly.

5
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:49,403
- Am I clear?
- Yes, all right.

6
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,387
Come on, give him your hand

7
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:52,499
Now the deal is over.

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,489
For you, don Francè

9
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:55,129
Be good.

10
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:57,208
Here, this is your cut.

11
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:58,723
Take care of it, Nicolì.

12
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:00,239
- Don Francè?.
- What's up?

13
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,606
Three, four, five...

14
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:06,310
- An important news.
- What's up?

15
00:02:06,646 --> 00:02:08,505
- Don Pasquale Ronciglio is back.
- Oh yes?

16
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,090
- He's going crazy.
- What does he want?

17
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,130
- He's going crazy.
- What does he want?
He says he is
in charge here.

18
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,490
He says he is
in charge here.

19
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:14,388
Does he say so?

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,341
Where is he now?

21
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:16,611
In the cows' pen

22
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:16,618
In the cows' pen
together with Tore the Scarred.

23
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:17,997
together with Tore the Scarred.

24
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:19,850
Let's go meet him

25
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,239
He must be with some friends.

26
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,294
Let's offer him a drink.

27
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:24,757
We must not think

28
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:25,817
that he came to provoke us.

29
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:26,521
You think so?

30
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:28,527
Maybe he wants to buy some
cows, who knows.

31
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,044
And if it's not
for that, then...

32
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:33,591
Well, then, it's his problem, don Francè.

33
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:34,856
He's over there, see?

34
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:35,958
Listen to me carefully

35
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,434
when Pasquale Ronciglio speaks

36
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:38,442
when Pasquale Ronciglio speaks
it is Law.

37
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:39,160
it is Law.

38
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:42,043
And nobody dares

39
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:43,630
to question his words.

40
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:44,638
And from today, here

41
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:45,579
everyone

42
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,793
must come to me.

43
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:48,653
and only to me,
got it?

44
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:51,005
Don Pasquà

45
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,388
Look who's here.

46
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,966
Don Francesco Aliprandi.

47
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,567
How come you're here?

48
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:57,739
That's what I ask you

49
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:59,364
I thought I explained
myself well

50
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:00,372
last time

51
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:03,052
didn't I?

52
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,348
You did indeed, as a God.

53
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:07,434
But you did not convince me.

54
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:08,203
No.

55
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:10,497
The market is big

56
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:12,716
too big for one man

57
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:13,830
so I thought to

58
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:15,021
leave the horned beasts to you

59
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:16,303
and the pigs for myself.

60
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:17,487
You are in charge of

61
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,020
the market for cows and oxen

62
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:20,653
and I the market for pigs.

63
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,411
It seems fair to me.

64
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:24,362
Or...

65
00:03:25,027 --> 00:03:26,933
...do you want to be the
king of the horned beasts

66
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:27,803
and the pigs?

67
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:30,464
Do you know what I say?

68
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:31,482
It is a real pity

69
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,289
that we have not
organized

70
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,933
the shit market

71
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:34,745
otherwise...

72
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,300
... the king of the
assholes would be you!

73
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:40,761
Don Ciccio

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,826
the mouth that dares

75
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,237
to offend Pasquale Ronciglio

76
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,099
will not speak again

77
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,651
if not to apologize.

78
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:48,662
If you are a man of honor

79
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,900
I'll wait for you at 11:00pm

80
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,042
at the Arzano warehouse.

81
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,253
Agreed.

82
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:56,409
And to show you my
good intentions,

83
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:57,847
now,

84
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,159
I'll give you an advance.

85
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:11,714
Let's go.

86
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:38,423
Hello!

87
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:39,784
Daddy! Daddy!

88
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:45,272
My little prince

89
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:46,401
were you a good boy at school?

90
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:46,994
Yes, dad.

91
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,309
- Uh how cute!
- How cute it is!

92
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,659
- It's so tiny!

93
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,607
So champ, how are you?

94
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:00,535
Are you happy that your daddy

95
00:05:00,536 --> 00:05:01,815
came pick you up, eh?

96
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,838
- Why do not you come all the times?
- Dad is busy

97
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,706
- Nicolino is here as well.
- No, he's short.

98
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:07,401
For you I am always short?

99
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,554
Next time I'll call a soldier!

100
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:11,339
I also want my friends to see you,

101
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:12,415
you are an important father.

102
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,760
All fathers are important.

103
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,995
Come on let's go buy the bike.

104
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,066
The bike?

105
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,534
Dad, you promised it
for my party.

106
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:21,386
Today it's a big party for me.

107
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:22,316
Wait dad

108
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:23,698
Let's go it's late.

109
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,002
What are you doing

110
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,682
leave that dog alone, let's go.

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,511
Robè, hurry up, would you?

112
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:29,519
Let's go

113
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,480
But it's so small,
it can't even walk.

114
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:33,425
Why do not we take it?

115
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:34,894
Do it for me, dad!

116
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:35,914
Sure, let's go around

117
00:05:35,915 --> 00:05:37,339
collecting dogs on the street

118
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:38,213
let's do that

119
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,174
and it'll be perfect.

120
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:40,949
Dad, please

121
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,034
Let's take it!

122
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:43,001
Look

123
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:45,113
instead of the
bicycle, we take him.

124
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,987
Did not you want
the racing bike?

125
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:47,987
I do not care anymore,

126
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:47,996
I do not care anymore,
this is better than a bike

127
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:49,425
this is better than a bike

128
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:50,738
But it does not run though.

129
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:51,675
It does not matter.

130
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:53,277
Alright then

131
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:55,167
whatever you want, my little prince.

132
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:56,511
Are you happy now?

133
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:57,885
Thanks Dad.

134
00:05:58,395 --> 00:05:59,082
Go.

135
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:00,326
Be careful Nicolì,

136
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,199
dogs are messy, now you
will have to take care of them.

137
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,260
Jesus, Jesus, let's hope
he does not have fleas!

138
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:05,190
Right...

139
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:06,941
Be careful, you never know!

140
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:09,425
Even the dog now!

141
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:11,769
Nicolì, it is called Napoleon.

142
00:06:11,902 --> 00:06:13,019
The Emperor!

143
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:22,939
Good evening...

144
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:26,712
To everyone, good evening!

145
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,384
My good evening

146
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:30,618
I give it

147
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,329
to Madam Rosa!

148
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:35,078
My good evening

149
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:35,931
I give it

150
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,500
to everyone!

151
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,075
Everyone in the
neighborhood must

152
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,407
gets my good evening!

153
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,657
I told everyone
good evening

154
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,635
Napoleon!

155
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,479
Napoleon!

156
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,572
Wait wait!

157
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,369
No!

158
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,051
Stop, stop!

159
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,135
Don Franceso

160
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:22,611
Don Francesco!

161
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,181
What happened, Rosa?

162
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:26,025
What's all this
noise in the street?

163
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,658
A terrible thing, don Francè,

164
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:28,971
terrible!

165
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:29,929
A terrible thing?

166
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,001
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:31,986
Where is Roberto?

168
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:33,575
He wanted to catch the dog

169
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:34,736
that was running away

170
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,314
and a car ran over him!

171
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:39,236
Roberto! Roberto!

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,575
- My son, what have they done to you?
- Dad...

173
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,220
Dad, how's Napoleon?

174
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:46,279
Napoleon is fine

175
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,583
do not worry about it, think of you!

176
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:49,516
- Daddy do not cry, please!
- Don't move!

177
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:51,093
- Stay with me!
- No, I do not cry, yes,

178
00:08:51,094 --> 00:08:51,864
I'll stay with you!

179
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,427
Do not leave me daddy,
help me, help me!

180
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:55,439
I will not leave you, Dad
helps you, Dad helps you!

181
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:04,880
Dad, do not leave me!

182
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:07,107
Your dad won't leave
you, he won't leave you.

183
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,739
Slowly.

184
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:10,740
Slowly.
Where are they taking me?
Come with me, dad!

185
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,559
Where are they taking me?
Come with me, dad!

186
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:14,389
Yes, yes I am coming with
you, do not worry.

187
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:16,606
Slow down, do not hurt him!

188
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:18,818
I'm so scared!

189
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,192
No, do not be afraid,

190
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,458
do not be afraid, my son!

191
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:26,097
Don Francè, I'll come along!

192
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:27,466
I'll go with you too!

193
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,967
All right Rosa, come with us.

194
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:57,259
Guys,

195
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,025
when you see him

196
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,327
you know what you have to do.

197
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:25,109
Dad, do not worry

198
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,308
it's nothing

199
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:27,926
you will see, it is nothing!

200
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:49,402
Jesus, Jesus

201
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:50,839
I can not think about it

202
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,926
I was there, two steps away

203
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:55,301
I tried to stop him

204
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,471
but it was not possible!

205
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:01,152
Jesus.

206
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,527
I thought I was going crazy!

207
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,203
Two hours have passed here,

208
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,641
how come

209
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:07,829
we still don't know anything?

210
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:10,527
Yes, tell me

211
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:12,683
Yes, yes.

212
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:13,723
Yes.

213
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:15,924
All right, I understand.

214
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,627
Yes, professor.

215
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:18,895
Sister, sorry

216
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,661
I'm Francesco Alibrandi,

217
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,328
the father of the child

218
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:23,652
that was brought here a
little while ago.

219
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:24,762
How is him?

220
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:26,750
Tell me, is it bad?

221
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,672
He's still in surgery

222
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:31,586
Rest assured,

223
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,273
they are doing
everything possible.

224
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,633
Did you get any news?

225
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,297
Are there any hopes for my son?

226
00:11:36,407 --> 00:11:37,961
Sister, please, talk!

227
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,227
Only a miracle can save him.

228
00:11:40,672 --> 00:11:41,714
But have faith,

229
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:43,242
God is so merciful,

230
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:44,109
even if sometimes

231
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:45,655
He wants to test us.
- Yes.

232
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:49,210
You are right!

233
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,422
Yes.

234
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:20,745
It's 11 and three quarters.

235
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,159
You are witnesses

236
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:23,716
I waited for him,

237
00:12:23,717 --> 00:12:24,924
and he did not come

238
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,248
Francesco Aliprandi

239
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:27,866
is the last of the skunks.

240
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,073
Quite right!

241
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,010
Don Pasquà,

242
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:30,740
blood and wine

243
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:30,747
blood and wine
are the same color.

244
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:31,932
are the same color.

245
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,307
Now we are going to
have a nice soup,

246
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:35,391
a glass of Gragnano

247
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:37,065
at the tavern of Peppino The Russian.

248
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,868
It's a good idea

249
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,378
and call also a good guitar player

250
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:41,323
tonight around me I want
singing and good music.

251
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,542
Let's go guys.

252
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:10,932
Oxygen, oxygen.

253
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:36,870
Mother Mary...

254
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,607
"God is merciful

255
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,152
even if sometimes

256
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,793
he tests us".

257
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,661
Blood pressure?

258
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,044
It's collapsing, professor.

259
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,646
Increase oxygen.

260
00:14:07,154 --> 00:14:08,943
If God is truly merciful

261
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,333
so you must be as well,
as you are a mother!

262
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,310
Roberto must not die.

263
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:15,762
It is not right for
a child like him

264
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,294
to pay without a blame.

265
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:18,763
Do not abandon him,

266
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:19,949
be close to him.

267
00:14:22,622 --> 00:14:24,270
If someone has to suffer,

268
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:25,669
then choose me

269
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,505
and save Roberto.

270
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,262
He's all I have left.

271
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:32,380
Save my son, Mother Mary.

272
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,239
I give you my word of honor

273
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,200
that I will apologize

274
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,708
to Don Pasquale Ronciglio.

275
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:41,153
I swear I will do it

276
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,301
but you must save him!

277
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,810
You must save him...

278
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:52,692
We have done everything possible

279
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:53,700
but...

280
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,888
... I do not think
he will manage.

281
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,030
And speaking of wine

282
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,051
let's drink to the Neapolitan song!

283
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,920
The most beautiful song in the world!

284
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:36,451
And then let's have a toast

285
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:36,452
And then let's have a toast
to the health of Don
Pasquale Ronciglio,

286
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:38,435
to the health of Don
Pasquale Ronciglio,

287
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:40,108
the sugar of all Naples!

288
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,530
Hurray Pasquale!

289
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:42,912
Great Pasquale!

290
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,215
Don Francesco Aliprandi

291
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:01,684
do you like to do

292
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:02,833
April's fool off season ?

293
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:06,741
Or maybe your watch doesn't work

294
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,014
Don Pasqua'

295
00:17:09,522 --> 00:17:10,905
before all these friends

296
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,522
I humbly apologize to you

297
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,145
for what happened at the market.

298
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,850
I was crazy, sorry.

299
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,475
You heard, eh?

300
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,131
Don Francesco has converted

301
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,248
and he has became St. Francis!

302
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:38,997
Don Pasqua',

303
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:40,864
I did my duty.

304
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:43,559
I apologized

305
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,536
do not push it.

306
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:47,817
The scale can tilt over.

307
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:49,043
Alright then.

308
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:53,286
But since I appreciate

309
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:54,253
and I respect you

310
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,317
I want to give you back

311
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,426
a little improved

312
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:58,556
that deposit

313
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,200
that you have given me.

314
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:01,864
You gave me water

315
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,184
and I give you wine.

316
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,754
So we're even, eh?

317
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,105
Don Francè?

318
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,517
Don Francè,
did everything go well?

319
00:18:39,324 --> 00:18:40,581
Did it go well or not?

320
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,667
Nicolì,

321
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,175
I'm like that eel.

322
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,026
Look,

323
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:48,713
it is broken, yet it still moves

324
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:50,581
it wants to pretend it is alive.

325
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:53,363
But it's not true.

326
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,316
It's dead.

327
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,198
It's dead, like me.

328
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,514
- Documents - Hurry,
I'm in a hurry.

329
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,763
Right away, Sir

330
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,631
Brigadier, I am here
at your orders!

331
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:45,842
I'm not a brigadier.

332
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:47,623
Jesus, so to speak.

333
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:48,694
No offense.

334
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,708
What happened?

335
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:50,444
It happened

336
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:51,452
that you have done

337
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:52,756
a right turn

338
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:53,631
without signaling it

339
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,087
and therefore you must
get a ticket.

340
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:56,092
Uh, Jesus!

341
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,597
A right turn?

342
00:21:57,628 --> 00:21:58,724
It is not possible!

343
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,537
Why is not it possible?

344
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:01,896
It's not possible because...

345
00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:03,443
... my steering wheel is blocked.

346
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:04,505
It doesn't
turn right!

347
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,372
I understand, all right,

348
00:22:05,372 --> 00:22:06,411
circulation license.

349
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,443
What license?

350
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:09,130
The license for public transport.

351
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:09,919
Is this a taxi?

352
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:11,270
What taxi, brigadier?

353
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:12,442
Where is the taxi?

354
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:13,712
This! Is it yours?

355
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:15,222
- Which one?
- The taxi!

356
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:16,867
This is a taxi, isn't it?

357
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:17,907
Yes, it's also written so,

358
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,570
Brigadier, that's my name

359
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:22,929
Nicolino Tassi,

360
00:22:23,103 --> 00:22:24,415
at your command!

361
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,696
You even
painted it yellow?!

362
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:28,430
Why? You don't like yellow?

363
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:29,579
It's a beautiful color!

364
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,282
Wait a moment.

365
00:22:34,579 --> 00:22:36,055
Sir, yes sir, brigadier!

366
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:39,743
Go on!

367
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,759
I'll miss the plane

368
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:44,359
but what the heck!
- Right away

369
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:46,516
the plane will wait
do not worry!

370
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:55,943
What..are you crazy?

371
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:57,630
He's calling you
- No...

372
00:22:58,318 --> 00:22:59,247
What do you want?

373
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,458
Are you in a hurry or not?

374
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,068
In the North, these things
don't happen...

375
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:47,908
So, are you done?

376
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:49,119
All right, Francè.

377
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:50,565
So go have lunch, come on.

378
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:51,533
Thank you.

379
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:56,283
Go eat!

380
00:23:59,213 --> 00:23:59,908
Okay then

381
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:01,150
at three o'clock
you'll be here.

382
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,150
Okay engineer, see you!

383
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,590
Francè I'm going to eat,

384
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:05,314
see you later.

385
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,786
Don Francesco.

386
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:10,372
Don Francesco, here you are!

387
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,927
I told you many times

388
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:13,247
get rid of that "don".

389
00:24:13,598 --> 00:24:14,817
I do not want to
repeat it anymore,

390
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:15,536
do you understand?

391
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:17,528
I humbly beg your pardon,

392
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:18,466
Don Francesco.

393
00:24:18,662 --> 00:24:19,646
Again?

394
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:21,325
See, it's stronger than me

395
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:22,567
what can I do?

396
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:22,574
what can I do?
- All right, forget it.
- What do you want?

397
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:24,239
- All right, forget it.
- What do you want?

398
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:25,278
I want to tell you that

399
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:26,466
the results are out.

400
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:27,512
- The results?
- Eh!

401
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:28,863
The school report card

402
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:30,060
of your son!

403
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,044
And how did he go?

404
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:32,232
How did he go?

405
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,114
Like a supersonic plane,

406
00:24:34,185 --> 00:24:35,585
Don Francesco!

407
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:37,409
All right, forget it

408
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:38,146
it does not matter

409
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:38,869
tell me!

410
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,060
He passed with great scores!

411
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,646
He's now an accountant!

412
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:46,966
Accountant!

413
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:49,067
Eh, what a big deal, he's not an emperor!

414
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,231
Oh my God.

415
00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:50,810
Don Francè

416
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,797
are not you happy?
- Yes, I'm happy.

417
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,583
At least this crappy job,

418
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,403
has given me this
joy, eh!

419
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,950
Tomorrow we will
celebrate, Nicolì!

420
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,005
Of course!

421
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:05,985
Did you bring me
something to eat?

422
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:07,165
Of course I did!

423
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,290
An excellent omelette

424
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,946
with side dish of dessert

425
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,180
that's eggs and cheese

426
00:25:12,189 --> 00:25:13,688
do you try to make them
more appealing now?

427
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:14,704
Eh, Nicolì?

428
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:16,040
you know how it is

429
00:25:16,052 --> 00:25:17,154
to sugarcoat

430
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:19,009
makes life more bearable.

431
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:20,149
Did you eat?

432
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,744
No, I have a child's stomach

433
00:25:21,757 --> 00:25:23,412
that just...
- I get it

434
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,140
when you talk like
this, you're starving

435
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,595
eat, come on.
- Just to taste it

436
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:27,852
just to taste it!

437
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:31,696
Would you like some?

438
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:45,828
Who are those people?

439
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:47,992
What do you care,
think about eating

440
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:49,250
I was just saying...

441
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,160
What do you want?

442
00:25:55,465 --> 00:25:56,847
Don Pasquale sent us.

443
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:58,125
They told us,

444
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,541
that you know why.

445
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,660
One moment,

446
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,073
there must be a mistake.

447
00:26:02,113 --> 00:26:03,644
I do not know anything about this.
- That's enough!

448
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,910
- Leave me!
- Get in there.

449
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:07,550
We'll show you...

450
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,933
Salvatore, look at him,

451
00:26:08,956 --> 00:26:10,753
doesn't he look like
Francesco Aliprandi?

452
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,629
Who, that beggar over there?

453
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,308
Yes, the big one that's eating.

454
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:17,183
Yeah, it's him

455
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,422
let's see what he says

456
00:26:18,422 --> 00:26:18,425
let's see what he says
that piece of shit.

457
00:26:18,425 --> 00:26:19,698
that piece of shit.

458
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:20,699
Let's go check it out.

459
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,058
I know it's a frittata

460
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,746
but omelette is nicer.

461
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:25,589
Let me look at him.

462
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,035
Let me look at him good

463
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,814
this stinky one.
- It's him!

464
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,285
I do not think so.

465
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:34,709
This one seems
an honest person.

466
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,855
He is a man who works.

467
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:38,785
Do you question my words?

468
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:40,824
We can find out immediately.

469
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:43,089
If he shits in his pants

470
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:45,091
You're right.

471
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:51,652
Go away.

472
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:53,940
Francesco Aliprandi,

473
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:55,308
stand up.

474
00:26:56,207 --> 00:26:57,582
Do you understand? Get up!

475
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:07,332
It's him!

476
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:08,902
Francesco Aliprandi

477
00:27:08,997 --> 00:27:10,949
is a piece of shit!

478
00:27:11,135 --> 00:27:12,494
All Naples knows it!

479
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,189
And the whole world
must know it!

480
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:28,713
Roberto...

481
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:31,283
... is an accountant, eh?

482
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:49,814
Did I bother you?

483
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:50,855
You're an ass!

484
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,089
I won't sing then...

485
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:54,190
I raise the glass

486
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:56,634
to the health of the
new accountant!

487
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:59,058
- Best wishes!
- Good boy!

488
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:00,894
- Best wishes to Robertino!

489
00:28:01,534 --> 00:28:02,198
Dad,

490
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:03,814
we'll keep this.

491
00:28:03,902 --> 00:28:06,354
Best wishes, best wishes and best wishes!

492
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,409
- Best wishes!
- To health, to yours, best wishes!

493
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:10,308
- Thank you.
- The cake!

494
00:28:10,362 --> 00:28:12,245
- No, I do not
want the cake, eh!

495
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:14,050
I baked it, it came out really well.

496
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:15,050
Accountant?

497
00:28:15,051 --> 00:28:16,056
He has the face

498
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,814
of Ministry of Finance!

499
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:21,003
Nicolì, what are you
doing, you are making fun of Roberto?

500
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:21,980
Why?

501
00:28:22,073 --> 00:28:22,870
No, I said

502
00:28:22,886 --> 00:28:24,964
the Swiss Ministry of Finance!

503
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,198
Hey Mariù,

504
00:28:28,222 --> 00:28:29,730
do not you wish Roberto well?

505
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:31,300
Come on, give him
a kiss, come on.

506
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:32,839
No.

507
00:28:32,894 --> 00:28:34,425
Why not, what's
wrong with you?

508
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,393
He saw you when you were born

509
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:36,362
and now you are shy?

510
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,214
Come here Mariù

511
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:38,370
I'll give you a kiss.

512
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:40,174
Give him the kiss, come on!
- Ugh!

513
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:41,183
Behave!

514
00:28:42,168 --> 00:28:42,792
Mariù!

515
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,964
Why are you acting like that?

516
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:46,183
Mariù where are you going?

517
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:47,605
Come here right away, come on!

518
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:48,940
Mariù!

519
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:53,690
Come on, come back to the table, Mariù

520
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,331
They are wild at that age

521
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,119
don't mind it.

522
00:28:56,207 --> 00:28:57,831
Hey, what are we doing?
Don't we dance?

523
00:28:58,378 --> 00:29:00,097
The dance of honor is up to me, eh!

524
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:01,823
Who raised

525
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,011
this amazing boy?

526
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:04,355
Are you hitting on me, Rosa?

527
00:29:04,361 --> 00:29:05,516
I raised you like a mother,

528
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:06,153
you are like my son.

529
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:07,698
So, let's start the dances!

530
00:29:07,777 --> 00:29:09,237
I would dance with the lady!

531
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:10,017
Hey Nicolì

532
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:12,525
Nicolì, do not push it!

533
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:14,068
Absolutely not!

534
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,439
Mrs..

535
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:21,822
Humbly...

536
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:24,306
... I was a Charleston champion!

537
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:27,783
Thanks Francè.

538
00:29:28,994 --> 00:29:30,455
Giovà, I wanted to talk to you.

539
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:33,252
Why, what have we been doing so far?

540
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,783
No, please, do not joke around

541
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:35,981
I speak seriously.

542
00:29:36,202 --> 00:29:36,920
All right.

543
00:29:37,031 --> 00:29:38,070
Oh boy,

544
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,452
I'm not as young as you are.

545
00:29:39,466 --> 00:29:41,090
What do you think, I'm old now

546
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,093
What do you think, I'm old now
old unfortunately!

547
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,169
old unfortunately!

548
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:43,171
What are you saying, Donna Rosa?

549
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:44,319
You are still a babba'!

550
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,140
Sure...

551
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,106
You're a candy, Donna Rosa!

552
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,984
What I have done so far

553
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:56,124
I did it only for Roberto

554
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,382
to give him an honest life.

555
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:00,593
I suffered everything,

556
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,054
insults, humiliations

557
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,429
they spared me nothing,

558
00:30:04,447 --> 00:30:05,593
nothing, dear Giovanni.

559
00:30:06,156 --> 00:30:07,491
If you are up and go down

560
00:30:07,726 --> 00:30:08,956
nobody helps you.

561
00:30:09,077 --> 00:30:10,452
This is life, my dear.

562
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,008
Yes, but I want to
change this life.

563
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:12,792
I am fed up

564
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:14,158
to always be among people

565
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:15,970
that remind me of
what I used to be.

566
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:17,225
Well you know it.

567
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,812
I'm a theatre entrepreneur,

568
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:20,501
and if you'll come to the
theater tomorrow

569
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:21,825
I'm sure together

570
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:23,430
we will find a deal, okay?
- Thank you.

571
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:24,943
I knew I could count on you.

572
00:30:25,063 --> 00:30:26,070
Do not even mention it.

573
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:32,538
My lady!

574
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:34,530
You are very tall!

575
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:38,262
Stop now Robertino please

576
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:39,903
my head is spinning,
I'm collapsing

577
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:40,817
What are you saying, Rosa?

578
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:41,605
you never collapse,

579
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,247
you are eternal!

580
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:43,926
Are you kidding?
Oh my God, oh my God, my God

581
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:43,934
Are you kidding?
Oh my God, oh my God, my God
my head is spinning!

582
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:44,678
my head is spinning!

583
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:45,382
Sorry, sorry.

584
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:48,568
Donna Rosa has given up!

585
00:30:49,812 --> 00:30:51,093
Would you like to dance?

586
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:52,648
Hey, what's wrong?

587
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:54,483
- You don't like me at all?
- No, no

588
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:55,710
I do not dislike you.

589
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:57,241
So, Princess Cinderella,

590
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:58,873
Would you like to dance with me?

591
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,694
Madam, I was born to dance!

592
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:09,418
How beautiful they are!

593
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,800
Let's cheer to our
accountant, Francè!

594
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:22,073
To our health!

595
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:27,064
So, let's start from
the point that says:

596
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:28,327
"You have a mustache

597
00:31:28,328 --> 00:31:29,735
and take these slaps "

598
00:31:29,892 --> 00:31:30,743
All right?

599
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,610
Francesco Aliprandi is looking for you.

600
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,087
Come come!

601
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:35,907
Are you ready?

602
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:37,368
Of course I'm ready.

603
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:40,048
You should focus on your
character's face!

604
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:40,780
- Hi
- Sit down.

605
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:41,703
So you are giving me your advice!

606
00:31:41,703 --> 00:31:41,709
So you are giving me your advice!
Who should I give it to, my grandma?

607
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:43,212
Who should I give it to, my grandma?

608
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:45,506
Mother Mary, Oh my God!

609
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:47,803
- After so many years of glorious career.
- They are starting.

610
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:49,726
- Start, it is late.
- Come on!

611
00:31:58,305 --> 00:32:00,086
Right from there you
had to start, yes?

612
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,312
From the slaps!

613
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:03,154
I have to remember
the beginning!

614
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:06,000
You have a mustache

615
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:08,706
and now take these slaps!

616
00:32:09,335 --> 00:32:10,351
Holy God!

617
00:32:10,444 --> 00:32:11,709
Oh my God!

618
00:32:11,774 --> 00:32:13,773
The theater will burst!

619
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:14,879
No, no, no!

620
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,300
The theatre won't burst

621
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,526
But my name will
fall from the poster!

622
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:21,027
What the hell did
the author write?

623
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,302
You'll see that this asshole

624
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:23,345
will make a mess!

625
00:32:23,345 --> 00:32:23,347
will make a mess!
Calm down Giovà

626
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:24,003
Calm down Giovà

627
00:32:24,019 --> 00:32:25,597
What do you want,
this is what the author wrote

628
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:26,665
do you want to stop it or not?

629
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:27,288
I say

630
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:28,776
a positive man like me

631
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:30,487
of such an importance!

632
00:32:30,675 --> 00:32:32,775
Yes, of such an importance,
let's say...

633
00:32:32,838 --> 00:32:34,580
Let's say it, a man of honor!

634
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:35,456
An honorable!

635
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,073
He treats me like shit
in front of everyone

636
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:37,894
and I do not say anything?

637
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:39,231
Look at him, Jesus

638
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:39,233
Look at him, Jesus
in his normal life

639
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:40,413
in his normal life

640
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:41,739
people treat him like shit continuously

641
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,615
and he never does anything,

642
00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:42,622
and he never does anything,
but today he can't take it!

643
00:32:42,622 --> 00:32:43,764
but today he can't take it!

644
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,951
So you know what we do?

645
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,080
You will say the line

646
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:47,517
and he gets the slap, alright?

647
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:48,658
Are you okay with that or not?

648
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:50,415
Good, I like it, good!

649
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:51,501
All right!

650
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:52,916
Yes, so the theater tonight

651
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:52,924
Yes, so the theater tonight
will be covered
with whistles and boos!

652
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:54,774
will be covered
with whistles and boos!

653
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:55,712
All right

654
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:56,696
it's right.

655
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,219
- Are you all right with that?
- Yes, it's OK with me.

656
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,726
Should not I spit in your face?

657
00:32:59,782 --> 00:33:01,602
Let's calm down everyone

658
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:03,445
Listen, say what you want

659
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:05,011
but I won't do the
act like this!

660
00:33:05,022 --> 00:33:05,537
Ah, no?

661
00:33:05,675 --> 00:33:07,088
I'd make an ass of myself

662
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:08,515
in front of the audience!

663
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:08,516
in front of the audience!
- Aren't you used to it?
- What?

664
00:33:08,516 --> 00:33:09,858
- Aren't you used to it?
- What?

665
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:11,671
You're making me
lose my patience!

666
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,516
I can't believe it!

667
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,821
You have been signed up

668
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,141
to be a villain, or not?

669
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,071
Good!

670
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:18,805
Very well, finally

671
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:19,726
you said it!

672
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:20,614
The villain!

673
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:21,735
Not the moron!

674
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,086
Jesus, but...

675
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:24,133
...but you know it

676
00:33:24,187 --> 00:33:25,890
you have been taking slaps
all your life

677
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:27,266
now you are suddenly ashamed
of it

678
00:33:27,282 --> 00:33:28,052
and you do not want any more

679
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,289
so, you are doing it on purpose!

680
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:31,468
At least let me die by murder!

681
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:34,102
If it were a pivotal scene

682
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,243
I'd say yes!

683
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,680
I'd make such a fallen Madonna

684
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,640
that will make the theatre burst!

685
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:41,008
Who are you? Trinita'?!

686
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,066
Shut up,

687
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:43,407
what are you talking about!

688
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:44,723
I should shut up?

689
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,480
He's got so many aches and pains

690
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:47,925
he can't even walk

691
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:48,753
All right

692
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:49,448
Yes!

693
00:33:49,596 --> 00:33:50,271
Next time

694
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:50,393
Next time
I will put it in the contract

695
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:51,307
I will put it in the contract

696
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:53,268
slap, spit in the face
and kick in the ass

697
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:53,917
never!

698
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:55,237
No...!

699
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:56,740
You must tell me when

700
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:59,175
I will sign you up again!

701
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:00,065
I do not understand

702
00:34:00,077 --> 00:34:01,737
are we professionals

703
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:03,050
or amateurs!?

704
00:34:03,112 --> 00:34:04,065
Holy words!

705
00:34:04,323 --> 00:34:05,057
You know what?

706
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:05,811
you broke my balls

707
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:05,820
you broke my balls
like two salami of Afragola!

708
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,118
like two salami of Afragola!

709
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,199
A professional actor..

710
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:09,339
- Me, me!
- No!

711
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:10,449
Professional?

712
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:11,293
You are the head

713
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:12,626
of the artistic incompetence!

714
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:13,845
You are the dramatic result

715
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,017
of compulsory schooling

716
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:15,023
of compulsory schooling
That's enough!

717
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:15,634
That's enough!

718
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:16,472
Work

719
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:17,433
or you will not be paid

720
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,503
No, no, what do you
say Don Giovà...

721
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:20,820
I expressed my opinion

722
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:22,136
but if you do not agree

723
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:23,714
there are no problems!
- He regretted.

724
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,938
Listen up, listen up!

725
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:59,688
Here I am the first
actor, or not?

726
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,782
Yes sir, you play the first actor

727
00:35:01,978 --> 00:35:03,938
I don't play it, I am it!

728
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:05,844
So, if I'm the first actor

729
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:08,040
I'll be able to slap tons!

730
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:11,610
Come on, slap him and go on!

731
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:13,782
- Here!
- No, no, no!

732
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:16,524
I won't do it, I won't
do it and I won't do it!

733
00:35:16,672 --> 00:35:19,313
He won't do it, he won't
do it, he won't do it!

734
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,250
- Author!
- Author!

735
00:35:21,415 --> 00:35:23,508
- Author!
- Author!

736
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:25,211
What an hassle

737
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,812
I can never be calm.

738
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:28,508
- Author!
- Author!

739
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:30,336
Author I say it!

740
00:35:30,368 --> 00:35:31,610
Author says he!

741
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:32,801
Author!

742
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:34,188
Call the author!

743
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:35,976
A moment, what's up?

744
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,588
Let's see if it's possible

745
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:40,687
to take slaps off the script!

746
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:41,444
I say yes!

747
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:42,851
I can't take anything off.

748
00:35:43,812 --> 00:35:44,929
It's the song!

749
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:46,694
We must respect the rhymes.

750
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:49,405
You remember the lines

751
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,037
Yes or no?

752
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:50,796
Sure!

753
00:35:50,969 --> 00:35:52,594
"You have a mustache

754
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,367
and take these slaps "

755
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,625
Is it clear?

756
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:56,750
You see?

757
00:35:56,773 --> 00:35:57,633
It also rhymes.

758
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,507
You see?

759
00:35:58,523 --> 00:35:59,828
You are the one
with the mustache,

760
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:01,164
and so you are the one that
gets the slaps!

761
00:36:01,195 --> 00:36:03,109
Oh yes?
So I'll take off my mustache!

762
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:06,590
At least, I say

763
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:07,957
give me the satisfaction

764
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,267
to have a scuffle!

765
00:36:09,277 --> 00:36:10,003
Yes, maybe

766
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:10,938
we'll put a ring on the stage...

767
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:12,345
But there is no guappo

768
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:13,446
that would allow to be mortified

769
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:14,594
in front of the people!

770
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,141
You do not say anything!

771
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:17,532
I'll tell you!

772
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:18,641
I won't do it like that.

773
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:19,376
He won't do it.

774
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:19,960
Which guappo

775
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:20,978
would be mortified

776
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:20,986
would be mortified
in front of people like that?

777
00:36:20,986 --> 00:36:22,126
in front of people like that?

778
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:23,954
- This is not a guappo.
- And what then? What?

779
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:25,094
It is filth!

780
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,602
Ah, it's just filth...

781
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:28,056
You said a great truth,

782
00:36:28,143 --> 00:36:29,291
great truth.

783
00:36:29,362 --> 00:36:30,846
It is the ideal
character for you

784
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:31,916
Ideal for me?

785
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,477
And now you know
what I tell you?

786
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,838
That you'll play
your character!

787
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:37,716
Or else, you will never work again!

788
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,786
Is it clear?

789
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:40,520
- All right?
- All right?

790
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,544
Okay I say so!

791
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:43,942
All right, he says so!

792
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,090
Yes, of course I say it!

793
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,388
You have a mustache too.

794
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:49,794
So take these slaps!

795
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,739
Madonna, he killed me!

796
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:52,637
Is it possible that one

797
00:36:52,638 --> 00:36:53,398
must get angry

798
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:54,200
early in the morning?

799
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:55,880
I tried to give some sense
to my role,

800
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:57,575
because a guappo
that does not react

801
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,481
is not a guappo!

802
00:36:58,552 --> 00:36:59,927
But if it's okay with you...

803
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:02,614
At least try to pay
me a little more

804
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:03,973
as an incentive.

805
00:37:04,044 --> 00:37:05,544
- I protest!
- Forget it...

806
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,185
Giovà I don't think today is
a good day to speak about work.

807
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:10,724
Let's talk later, okay?

808
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:11,536
All right.

809
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:13,950
Nicolì call Roberto, let's go.

810
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:15,872
Right away.

811
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:16,935
My gentlemen

812
00:37:17,326 --> 00:37:18,396
You know what?

813
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:20,468
It is useless to go
around obstacles.

814
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:21,737
Let us postpone the matter

815
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,100
of the slaps this evening.

816
00:37:23,272 --> 00:37:24,460
Let's get back to rehearsing, come on.

817
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:24,960
Yes Yes Yes.

818
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:26,639
we'll do everything you want

819
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,121
but I stick with my mind.

820
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:29,036
Yeah Ok...

821
00:37:29,107 --> 00:37:31,161
- Are you stuck?
- One moment...

822
00:37:32,357 --> 00:37:34,630
Come on, your father
is waiting for you!

823
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:37,669
- And I would like to hear the scream
- Yes, I scream too

824
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:38,528
Come on!

825
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,949
- You have a mustache face...
- Robè...

826
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:42,531
Go easy, we're rehearsing.

827
00:37:42,658 --> 00:37:43,946
And do not move!

828
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:46,634
You have a mustache face

829
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:48,149
and get these slaps!

830
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:50,399
Good!

831
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:53,016
Good! Bis! Again

832
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:55,313
Robè, you too now?

833
00:37:55,454 --> 00:37:57,766
- Go, Dad is waiting for you
- Come on Robè...

834
00:37:58,024 --> 00:37:59,344
Come on, from the beginning.

835
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,459
Let's take it back from the slap

836
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,992
without giving him the slap.

837
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:33,636
Hello!

838
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:36,246
Do not you remember me?

839
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:37,847
Were you in the
theater at the rehearsal?

840
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:39,504
In front row...

841
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:40,866
And if I'm not mistaken

842
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,277
you also looked at my legs.

843
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:44,175
How could I not look at them

844
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:45,488
they were so beautiful.

845
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:49,949
What are you doing here?

846
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:50,957
I was waiting.

847
00:38:51,082 --> 00:38:52,074
Waiting for whom?

848
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,660
You.

849
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,613
You me?
And why?

850
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:57,511
Because...

851
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,543
...well...

852
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:01,761
... I wanted to see you again!

853
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:04,201
Look,

854
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:05,318
do we want to quit

855
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:06,527
with being so formal,

856
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:07,292
what do you think?

857
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,464
And do we want to quit

858
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:09,574
saying nonsense?

859
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,394
I do not like being stopped
in the street, all right?

860
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:32,907
And...

861
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:34,188
... how did you know

862
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:35,712
that I was there at Sannazzaro?

863
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:37,134
Uncle Giovanni told me.

864
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:38,106
I wanted to see you again

865
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:39,235
after that audition at the theatre

866
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:40,886
- I mean, wait
- And no, eh...

867
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:42,362
Or both, or nothing

868
00:39:42,472 --> 00:39:43,239
We become informal

869
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,542
and you leave me alone okay?

870
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:45,073
But why

871
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:46,233
I'm not a thief.

872
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:47,651
If it were enough
not to be a thief

873
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:49,315
do you know how many people I
would have chasing me?

874
00:39:49,409 --> 00:39:50,482
Well considering our times

875
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:51,354
very few.

876
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:52,658
Maybe you're right.

877
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:56,322
You know, I think it's
hard to get rid of you.

878
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,721
In your opinion,
what should I do?

879
00:39:57,746 --> 00:39:59,387
Scream with joy
to see you again

880
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,953
and throw my arms
around your neck?

881
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:03,628
No, but we could get to know
each other better

882
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,183
go out together sometimes.

883
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:07,199
Should I consider it an
official invitation?

884
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,746
Yes, an official invitation!

885
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:10,637
You're rich then.

886
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:12,629
I'm not complaining.

887
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:15,137
Would you like to go
to the cinema?

888
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:16,668
I can not stand it.

889
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:18,972
Look, there's a better idea.

890
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:19,957
I know a place

891
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,746
where it is possible
to have a snack and dance.

892
00:40:21,895 --> 00:40:22,965
- Agreed?
- Agreed!

893
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:24,105
So, see you tonight.

894
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:25,324
See you tonight!

895
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,824
It's the mirror's fault.

896
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:35,707
you don't see yourself?

897
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:37,074
You are handsome!

898
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,832
Sorry dad.

899
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:10,716
No thanks, I'm not
hungry anymore.

900
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:12,864
No no thank you.

901
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:14,732
No thanks Rosa, I'm
not hungry anymore.

902
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,786
Now you repeat what I say?

903
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:17,677
Sorry dad

904
00:41:17,787 --> 00:41:19,529
I'm not really hungry tonight.

905
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:20,982
That's no true, you've devoured the soup!

906
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:21,896
Soup?

907
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:23,521
Yes, of course, the soup

908
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:25,904
That's why I'm not
hungry anymore.

909
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:27,396
Listen you...

910
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:28,276
Leave him alone, Rosa.

911
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,786
He is in a hurry to go out.

912
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:31,325
Did not you notice?

913
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:33,154
He deserves it.

914
00:41:33,177 --> 00:41:34,950
He studied all year long.

915
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:36,607
- Go ahead
- Thanks dad!

916
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:45,607
Look dad...

917
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:48,208
Here is the request, eh!

918
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,302
I get it, I get it.

919
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:54,583
Ten thousand liras.

920
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:56,255
I'm sorry I can
not give you more.

921
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:57,200
Daddy, it will be enough!

922
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,685
Do not worry, thanks, bye!

923
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,029
- Bye Rosa!
- Be careful, my son!

924
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:02,165
Pretty boy!

925
00:42:09,451 --> 00:42:10,272
Roberto!

926
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:12,046
What's up?

927
00:42:12,757 --> 00:42:13,569
Where are you going?

928
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:14,764
Out.

929
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:16,046
Out where?

930
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:17,483
What do you care?

931
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:54,776
So?

932
00:42:54,808 --> 00:42:55,534
Go on.

933
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:57,808
Then at some point

934
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,808
he stops the Rolls

935
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:00,697
and he tells me:
"Do you want to get out, honey?"

936
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:01,917
And I, confused:

937
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,566
"Why? I do not live here."

938
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:04,925
And he: "Yes I know

939
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:06,558
but I want to show you
a little thing. "

940
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:15,441
Same brand?

941
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,714
Of course, same brand.

942
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:20,006
Do not you drink?

943
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:20,870
You look upset...

944
00:43:21,004 --> 00:43:21,831
Are you feeling bad?

945
00:43:21,941 --> 00:43:23,081
No, I'm fine

946
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:24,433
Do not worry.

947
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:26,198
As you want

948
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,480
so what was I saying?

949
00:43:27,496 --> 00:43:28,378
Ah yes, here

950
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,878
I do not trust the guy
very much

951
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:31,003
but I get out the car anyway.

952
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,042
He takes me to a
big jewelry store.

953
00:43:33,136 --> 00:43:34,394
He takes a necklace of emeralds

954
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:35,409
and puts it around my neck.

955
00:43:35,503 --> 00:43:36,644
He says to me: "It's yours!

956
00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:38,026
And if you do not like
it we'll change it,

957
00:43:38,037 --> 00:43:39,299
and take everything you want!

958
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:40,198
And then?

959
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,136
After?

960
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:42,319
There is not a later...

961
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:43,995
... I always wake up
at the same point!

962
00:43:44,011 --> 00:43:44,964
Do you believe in dreams?

963
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,151
Do you believe that
if you dream

964
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,202
always the same thing

965
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:48,175
at some point, it'll come true?

966
00:43:48,714 --> 00:43:49,480
I do not know

967
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:50,581
I never dreamed.

968
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:52,120
But it is not possible!

969
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,308
Everyone dreams.

970
00:43:53,448 --> 00:43:54,635
Maybe you do not remember it.

971
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:55,791
No, it's impossible.

972
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:57,331
I have a strong memory.

973
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:58,617
I remember even

974
00:43:58,633 --> 00:43:59,638
the color of the panties

975
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:00,448
that you brought when

976
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:01,581
I saw you the first time.

977
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:02,142
Shame on you

978
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:03,566
you shouldn't say certain things.

979
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:04,994
Listen, what do you do in life?

980
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,230
So what's your job?

981
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,456
I do nothing.

982
00:44:07,847 --> 00:44:09,073
Are you that rich?

983
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,046
No, I mean

984
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:11,331
that I am unemployed.

985
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,058
I finished school
a month ago.

986
00:44:13,441 --> 00:44:14,164
You're one of those

987
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:15,416
daddy's brats

988
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:16,745
graduates, lawyers,

989
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:17,620
what are you?

990
00:44:17,754 --> 00:44:18,756
I am an accountant,

991
00:44:18,757 --> 00:44:19,980
only accountant.

992
00:44:20,129 --> 00:44:21,073
Accountant?

993
00:44:23,457 --> 00:44:24,870
Are there accountants
that are millionaires?

994
00:44:24,886 --> 00:44:26,362
That made a lot of money?

995
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:27,433
I do not think so.

996
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:34,011
I like this song,
let's go!

997
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,161
This way.

998
00:46:02,563 --> 00:46:03,586
Who's that girl?

999
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,444
I do not know her

1000
00:46:04,452 --> 00:46:05,977
it's the first time
she comes here.

1001
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:07,774
And is she alone?

1002
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:09,368
No, she's with that guy.

1003
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:12,000
Please, Mr. Ronciglio.

1004
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,899
What can we bring you tonight?

1005
00:46:24,696 --> 00:46:25,438
The usual.

1006
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,375
Good.

1007
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:39,171
Not bad at all the girl, eh?

1008
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:49,530
I like dancing.

1009
00:46:51,171 --> 00:46:52,436
I would do it all night.

1010
00:46:53,632 --> 00:46:54,811
What is this?

1011
00:46:56,577 --> 00:46:57,507
The bill.

1012
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:59,405
Damn, what a rip-off!

1013
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,975
Why, how much is it?

1014
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:02,218
Fifty thousand.

1015
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,975
Something wrong, sir?

1016
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:06,428
No, it's that...

1017
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:08,202
I'm afraid I don't have

1018
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:09,975
enough money with me.

1019
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,741
What are you talking about?

1020
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:13,051
You do not have the money

1021
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:13,061
You do not have the money
to pay the bill?

1022
00:47:13,061 --> 00:47:13,965
to pay the bill?

1023
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:14,975
What's happening?

1024
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,733
The gentleman can not
pay the bill.

1025
00:47:16,803 --> 00:47:18,280
- Take them to the office.
- Please gentlemen.

1026
00:47:18,312 --> 00:47:19,124
One moment.

1027
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:20,686
They are my guests.

1028
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:21,616
And bring them a bottle

1029
00:47:21,636 --> 00:47:22,936
of what I drink.
- Right away.

1030
00:47:25,014 --> 00:47:26,045
Have a seat.

1031
00:47:26,225 --> 00:47:27,147
You are very kind.

1032
00:47:27,436 --> 00:47:28,077
Really...

1033
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:29,772
... I do not know
how to thank you.

1034
00:47:29,874 --> 00:47:30,530
Mr.?

1035
00:47:30,725 --> 00:47:31,420
Ronciglio.

1036
00:47:31,804 --> 00:47:33,202
There is nothing to thank about.

1037
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:34,366
It's nothing.

1038
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:35,770
I like

1039
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:37,303
to be with young people

1040
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:38,470
Especially when

1041
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:39,928
they look so nice.

1042
00:47:40,272 --> 00:47:41,280
Thank you.

1043
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,436
You are very kind, Mr. Ronciglio.

1044
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:46,241
What's your name?

1045
00:47:46,335 --> 00:47:47,412
Ninfarosa.

1046
00:47:48,108 --> 00:47:49,350
A graceful name.

1047
00:47:50,686 --> 00:47:51,577
And what do you do?

1048
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:53,608
I am an actor in a small theatre.

1049
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,670
Nothing important yet.

1050
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,983
You're young, you have
time to succeed.

1051
00:47:58,194 --> 00:47:59,803
It depends on your effort

1052
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,381
and on the right friendships.

1053
00:48:03,132 --> 00:48:04,077
And what do you do?

1054
00:48:04,154 --> 00:48:04,944
Nothing at the moment,

1055
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:06,264
I'm unemployed.

1056
00:48:06,296 --> 00:48:07,342
Roberto is an accountant,

1057
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:08,685
he graduated recently.

1058
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:09,514
And, you know

1059
00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:10,623
nowadays

1060
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:12,545
he has yet to find a
permanent job.

1061
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:13,153
He also

1062
00:48:13,154 --> 00:48:14,077
needs

1063
00:48:14,085 --> 00:48:15,439
the right friendship.

1064
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,530
But he does not have it...

1065
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,686
Come on, Ninfarosa

1066
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:18,733
this is not the moment.

1067
00:48:18,748 --> 00:48:20,911
Let her talk, what's wrong

1068
00:48:22,202 --> 00:48:23,577
You care about it, do not you?

1069
00:48:23,655 --> 00:48:24,626
I would be very grateful

1070
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:25,952
to whom would give him a hand.

1071
00:48:30,912 --> 00:48:31,983
Let me look into it.

1072
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:35,787
Tomorrow

1073
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:37,217
come here in my name

1074
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,639
and something could be done.

1075
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:40,655
All will work out fine.

1076
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:42,444
- Thank you!
- No worries.

1077
00:48:45,952 --> 00:48:47,655
To your luck, guys.

1078
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,123
Now let's have fun, eh?

1079
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:57,194
Shall we dance?

1080
00:48:57,241 --> 00:48:58,241
With pleasure.

1081
00:50:19,734 --> 00:50:22,101
Dolphin calls Shark.
Dolphin calls Shark.

1082
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:23,482
If you are listening, answer.

1083
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:26,819
Dolphin calls Shark.
Dolphin calls Shark.

1084
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,312
If you are listening, answer.

1085
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,171
Over.

1086
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:32,374
Shark listening.
Shark listening.

1087
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:33,804
I am in the established area.

1088
00:50:33,843 --> 00:50:34,963
Over.

1089
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:36,890
I am in the established area.

1090
00:50:36,897 --> 00:50:37,576
Over..

1091
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,991
Damn, where are you
I can't see you

1092
00:50:40,026 --> 00:50:42,006
you're making me lose my sight.

1093
00:50:43,179 --> 00:50:44,382
Make me a daisy.

1094
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,113
How are you?

1095
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,101
all ok?

1096
00:50:49,203 --> 00:50:50,671
Good, good enough.

1097
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,538
You'll see that next time

1098
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:53,764
it will be even better.

1099
00:50:57,609 --> 00:50:58,444
Here they are!

1100
00:50:58,679 --> 00:50:59,866
All right, shut off.

1101
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:01,124
I saw them.

1102
00:51:01,202 --> 00:51:02,327
It's positive!

1103
00:51:57,137 --> 00:51:58,605
Come on, we are almost done

1104
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,355
Boy, ready?

1105
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:01,402
Yes done!

1106
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:03,543
All right!

1107
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:25,730
Roberto!

1108
00:52:26,402 --> 00:52:27,707
You finally arrived!

1109
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:29,254
My love!

1110
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:51,873
Here it is.

1111
00:52:51,912 --> 00:52:53,066
Say what you want

1112
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:54,483
but for me the best coffee

1113
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:56,373
is always the
old-fashioned one.

1114
00:52:56,694 --> 00:52:57,714
Those modern traps

1115
00:52:57,715 --> 00:52:59,045
are good for nothing.

1116
00:52:59,108 --> 00:53:00,123
I agree!

1117
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:01,693
Hurry up Rosa

1118
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:02,966
or I'll be late.

1119
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:05,607
Here it is.

1120
00:53:05,897 --> 00:53:07,271
How is this work going?

1121
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:08,888
I'd like you to
tell me something

1122
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,146
about what you do and
who these people are.

1123
00:53:10,951 --> 00:53:11,545
Come on Robè,

1124
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:12,607
talk to your dad.

1125
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:14,482
Dad, now it's just
a training period.

1126
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:15,365
For superstition,

1127
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,574
I prefer not to say anything.

1128
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:17,443
And you know

1129
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:19,576
it's about administrative checks.

1130
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:22,045
A company... of canned food.

1131
00:53:22,678 --> 00:53:23,137
You know

1132
00:53:23,138 --> 00:53:23,967
accounting books,

1133
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:25,074
tax reports,

1134
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:26,473
then if they are happy,

1135
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,912
in two months they will hire me.

1136
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:30,388
That's all?

1137
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,193
That's all.

1138
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,763
Now I have to go, bye dad.

1139
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:39,193
Dear Rosa,

1140
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,521
this boy

1141
00:53:40,522 --> 00:53:41,771
is not telling the truth.

1142
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:51,474
I'm loaded, go!

1143
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,651
So, are you happy?

1144
00:54:17,745 --> 00:54:19,425
- I'm really happy.
- You like it, eh?

1145
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,495
Yes!

1146
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:22,699
You are indeed earning a lot
of money

1147
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,588
with this job!

1148
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:25,565
Can't complain!

1149
00:54:25,644 --> 00:54:26,557
Is it dangerous?

1150
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:27,612
No, it's not dangerous

1151
00:54:27,659 --> 00:54:29,159
it's a piece of cake for me!
- Wait up!

1152
00:54:31,074 --> 00:54:32,276
Look, that's so pretty

1153
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:33,347
Will you buy it for me?

1154
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:34,026
Which one?

1155
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,292
The one over there.

1156
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:36,631
All right, come in.

1157
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,675
- Will it be very expensive?
- No, come, come!

1158
00:54:39,714 --> 00:54:40,729
I'll buy you
whatever you want!

1159
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:52,623
This one, Mariù?

1160
00:54:52,663 --> 00:54:53,725
I do not like it.

1161
00:54:54,256 --> 00:54:56,076
Then your mother will come see it.

1162
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:15,154
Come on, move

1163
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:16,693
or your mum will get angry!

1164
00:55:27,022 --> 00:55:28,123
And what are you doing here?

1165
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:29,686
Why do not you go
back home?

1166
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,076
Are you angry with me?

1167
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:34,982
And with whom then?

1168
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:36,912
With Roberto.

1169
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,342
Roberto?

1170
00:55:39,913 --> 00:55:41,311
What did Roberto do to you?

1171
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:44,318
Come on, tell me everything.

1172
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,178
Come on.

1173
00:55:47,585 --> 00:55:48,506
So?

1174
00:55:49,186 --> 00:55:50,982
I met him this morning.

1175
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:52,225
He was with a girl

1176
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:53,606
and he kissed her

1177
00:55:53,944 --> 00:55:55,272
in front of everybody!

1178
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:57,225
Where?

1179
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,615
In the middle of the road.

1180
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:00,186
In the middle of the road!

1181
00:56:01,014 --> 00:56:02,767
Here, now talk slowly

1182
00:56:02,782 --> 00:56:04,534
and tell me everything

1183
00:56:04,542 --> 00:56:05,839
Ok Mariù?

1184
00:56:29,946 --> 00:56:31,118
Go, go, boy, go!

1185
00:56:31,197 --> 00:56:32,597
Yes, get close.

1186
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:43,407
So you are the accountant, eh?

1187
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:43,999
Good,

1188
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,784
full inventory

1189
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:45,899
boat and warehouse

1190
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:46,695
and be careful,

1191
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:47,759
Don Pasquale is very picky.

1192
00:56:47,798 --> 00:56:48,618
All right.

1193
00:56:48,869 --> 00:56:50,735
- Have you got the load invoice?
- I have nothing.

1194
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:55,125
Have you got the warehouse load invoice?

1195
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:56,055
Yes, here is everything

1196
00:56:56,056 --> 00:56:57,217
you just have to check it

1197
00:56:57,249 --> 00:56:58,507
and sign the receipt.

1198
00:56:58,578 --> 00:56:59,468
All right.

1199
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:12,343
Robè?

1200
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:13,290
Yes, dad?

1201
00:57:13,712 --> 00:57:14,790
Come here.

1202
00:57:15,158 --> 00:57:16,120
Actually I'm tired

1203
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,220
I would like to go to bed.

1204
00:57:17,376 --> 00:57:18,782
Instead, you will
talk to me first.

1205
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:19,837
It has been a long time

1206
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:21,185
that we haven't seen each other,
you and me.

1207
00:57:21,236 --> 00:57:22,204
Come here.

1208
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:25,641
Well you know...

1209
00:57:25,986 --> 00:57:27,782
... there is a lot of
work at the office

1210
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:28,665
and then...

1211
00:57:28,767 --> 00:57:30,056
And then there are women

1212
00:57:30,345 --> 00:57:31,048
What did you say?

1213
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:32,009
Who's that girl,

1214
00:57:32,017 --> 00:57:33,228
who kissed you on the street

1215
00:57:33,229 --> 00:57:34,235
without being ashamed?

1216
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:35,501
Who told you?

1217
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:37,610
This does not matter.

1218
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:38,649
Answer.

1219
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,266
She is a girl.

1220
00:57:40,517 --> 00:57:41,681
This I already knew.

1221
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:42,946
- And then?
- And then nothing.

1222
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:44,105
We get along well

1223
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:45,446
and we go out from time to time.

1224
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:46,812
Once, we were
used to introduce

1225
00:57:46,828 --> 00:57:48,344
the girlfriend to our parents.

1226
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,930
Dad, she's not a girlfriend.

1227
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:50,688
Nowadays,

1228
00:57:50,706 --> 00:57:51,774
these things are not serious.

1229
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:52,469
Maybe to you.

1230
00:57:53,134 --> 00:57:54,821
- Not me.
- Sorry dad come on.

1231
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,228
One doesn't have to marry

1232
00:57:56,229 --> 00:57:57,178
all the women who...

1233
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:58,079
who...?

1234
00:57:58,306 --> 00:57:59,133
Go on...

1235
00:57:59,256 --> 00:57:59,763
I mean

1236
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:01,633
we get along well
and that's it.

1237
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:02,662
Who is she?

1238
00:58:03,826 --> 00:58:04,623
You know her,

1239
00:58:05,506 --> 00:58:07,349
she works in Uncle Giovanni's theatre.

1240
00:58:07,428 --> 00:58:08,302
She is a young actress.

1241
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:10,631
- Ah, that little hottie?
- Do not call her that!

1242
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,052
I call her what she deserves.

1243
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:13,787
She has already
caused a lot of trouble.

1244
00:58:13,832 --> 00:58:14,684
Careful Robè

1245
00:58:14,754 --> 00:58:15,559
Those are women

1246
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:16,685
that first lift you up

1247
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,521
and then sink you.

1248
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,568
Ninfarosa will not do it

1249
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:20,701
- She's like the others too
- No, they're all lies!

1250
00:58:20,772 --> 00:58:22,162
And I do not allow you
to say that!

1251
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,756
What did you say?

1252
00:58:24,256 --> 00:58:25,545
You do not allow me?

1253
00:58:26,061 --> 00:58:27,091
Your father?

1254
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:28,740
Sorry dad.

1255
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:31,591
It's that now I'm
not a kid anymore.

1256
00:58:31,647 --> 00:58:32,576
I'm a man.

1257
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:34,959
And I have the right
to my own opinion.

1258
00:58:35,037 --> 00:58:37,638
The rights are won
by merits.

1259
00:58:37,959 --> 00:58:39,263
Not by chatter!

1260
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,921
Your mother, before she died

1261
00:58:44,045 --> 00:58:44,745
I promised

1262
00:58:44,746 --> 00:58:46,069
to defend you any cost

1263
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,866
- And I'll do it Robè!
- All right, defend me.

1264
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,717
Defend me from
whatever you want!

1265
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:50,553
But do not push yourself

1266
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:51,874
into my life!

1267
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,116
Because it's mine and mine
alone, do you understand?

1268
00:58:56,226 --> 00:58:57,171
Roberto!

1269
00:58:58,578 --> 00:58:59,327
What will you

1270
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:00,054
show me now?

1271
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:01,026
Now I'll show you

1272
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:02,097
all the land on which

1273
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,039
we have put our hands

1274
00:59:03,064 --> 00:59:04,285
before the Regulatory Plan.

1275
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,161
But...

1276
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:07,379
- Are these lands close to town?
- Yup.

1277
00:59:07,864 --> 00:59:09,067
That is, outside town

1278
00:59:09,497 --> 00:59:10,411
but near the houses

1279
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:11,887
all in the building area

1280
00:59:11,902 --> 00:59:12,520
with building permits.

1281
00:59:12,606 --> 00:59:13,489
What about the mayor?

1282
00:59:13,685 --> 00:59:16,106
All right, the Plan is precise.

1283
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:17,786
Excuse me.

1284
00:59:18,005 --> 00:59:19,606
- Don't worry.
- Come, come.

1285
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,145
Sorry Don Pasquale

1286
00:59:21,168 --> 00:59:22,083
I would like to show you

1287
00:59:22,113 --> 00:59:23,726
the last operation
in Mergellina.

1288
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:25,019
Here it is

1289
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:25,908
This

1290
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:26,931
is the withdrawal made

1291
00:59:26,932 --> 00:59:28,308
for the gasoline for
the deliveries

1292
00:59:28,503 --> 00:59:29,854
and this one instead

1293
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:30,691
here, this one

1294
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,886
is the fuel withdrawal
for the motorboats.

1295
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:34,714
- Very good, Roberto
- And this...

1296
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,441
... this is the amount

1297
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:37,191
given to men

1298
00:59:37,212 --> 00:59:38,429
employed in the operation.

1299
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:39,776
Please sign over here.

1300
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:41,347
Good job.

1301
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,128
- I see you're accurate.
- Thank you.

1302
00:59:44,558 --> 00:59:46,371
- He's a good boy, I'm happy.
- Yup.

1303
00:59:47,605 --> 00:59:48,792
So Don Pasqua',

1304
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,488
here are the areas
that interest us.

1305
01:00:00,206 --> 01:00:02,269
Don Francesco still
owns the Mercedes.

1306
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:03,079
Good for him.

1307
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,879
The only thing left from
when he was a Boss.

1308
01:00:21,696 --> 01:00:23,438
Where's the stuff,
did you steal it?

1309
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:25,110
You have to pay for it,
do you understand?

1310
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,594
Leave this boy immediately!

1311
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:32,993
Piece of shit!

1312
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:37,227
Who are you?

1313
01:00:45,321 --> 01:00:46,438
Come here.

1314
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:50,329
What did those two want?

1315
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:52,167
- Money.
- Money?

1316
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:53,587
Why?

1317
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:54,633
Because...

1318
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,157
... they gave me some stuff

1319
01:00:56,177 --> 01:00:56,985
and now...

1320
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,329
... now they wanted to be paid.

1321
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,165
Why?

1322
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,414
For this.

1323
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:06,376
Drugs?
You are crazy!

1324
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:09,915
At your age?

1325
01:01:11,345 --> 01:01:12,462
Do you want to ruin yourself?

1326
01:01:17,993 --> 01:01:19,024
Stop!

1327
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:28,980
You go away

1328
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,933
and you too.

1329
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:33,129
As for you.

1330
01:01:33,138 --> 01:01:34,519
I advise you not to meddle

1331
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:35,201
if you do not want

1332
01:01:35,202 --> 01:01:36,293
Don Pasquale Ronciglio

1333
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:37,292
to get pissed off

1334
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:38,472
Ronciglio!

1335
01:01:38,918 --> 01:01:40,027
Even the children...

1336
01:01:40,144 --> 01:01:40,988
Listen to me,

1337
01:01:41,026 --> 01:01:42,011
listen to me well.

1338
01:01:42,022 --> 01:01:43,131
You came out of the games

1339
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:44,190
covering yourself with shit

1340
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:46,410
and covered with shit.
You have to hide

1341
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:49,128
You are out from guapperia

1342
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:50,824
And if you want to
live without trouble

1343
01:01:50,847 --> 01:01:52,081
think about your own business

1344
01:01:52,092 --> 01:01:53,748
don't get involved.

1345
01:01:53,785 --> 01:01:54,801
Is it clear?

1346
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:55,807
You're out.

1347
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,254
This is not guapperia

1348
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:58,582
it's just disgusting.

1349
01:02:00,403 --> 01:02:01,894
Anyway, I've warned you.

1350
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,301
You're out!

1351
01:02:15,674 --> 01:02:16,822
How disgusting...

1352
01:02:54,464 --> 01:02:55,729
Ninfarosa!

1353
01:02:58,527 --> 01:02:59,807
Ninfarò where are you?

1354
01:03:03,878 --> 01:03:04,901
Hello.

1355
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,042
I didn't hear you get in.

1356
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:10,081
What's wrong?

1357
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,940
What was Pasquale
Ronciglio doing here?

1358
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:16,893
My business.

1359
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:18,339
Are you jealous now?

1360
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:19,529
I do not want that man

1361
01:03:19,547 --> 01:03:20,842
to step foot in this house

1362
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:22,607
He must not look at you.

1363
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:23,310
Is it clear?!

1364
01:03:23,324 --> 01:03:24,475
Wait a moment

1365
01:03:24,516 --> 01:03:25,912
I do not take orders from anyone

1366
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:26,771
and from you the least!

1367
01:03:26,842 --> 01:03:27,763
I see who I like

1368
01:03:27,793 --> 01:03:28,801
and when I like.

1369
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:30,348
If it suits you, it's
like that and we are friends

1370
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:32,060
or else...
- Whore!

1371
01:03:32,544 --> 01:03:34,013
I do not allow you to
talk to me like that

1372
01:03:34,035 --> 01:03:34,771
and I will not allow

1373
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,798
that filthy man

1374
01:03:35,822 --> 01:03:36,896
to do as he wishes!

1375
01:03:36,919 --> 01:03:37,998
- Where are you going?
- Guess.

1376
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:38,965
No...

1377
01:03:39,014 --> 01:03:40,232
Roberto, wait a moment.

1378
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:41,263
Roberto!

1379
01:04:10,145 --> 01:04:12,168
Since when you don't
knock the door?

1380
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,332
I have to talk to you.

1381
01:04:13,754 --> 01:04:14,899
It's not a good reason

1382
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,043
get out and knock

1383
01:04:16,168 --> 01:04:18,488
Don Pasquale, I have to talk
to you about serious things.

1384
01:04:18,918 --> 01:04:19,918
You?

1385
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,363
You are kidding me

1386
01:04:22,379 --> 01:04:23,621
before talking about
serious things

1387
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,105
you must be a man.

1388
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:27,219
And to become a man,

1389
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,473
it will take some time.

1390
01:04:28,622 --> 01:04:30,813
I want you to leave Ninfarosa alone.

1391
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,527
I want?

1392
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:37,199
- Did you say exactly "I want"?
- Yup.

1393
01:04:37,606 --> 01:04:38,621
I said it.

1394
01:04:40,098 --> 01:04:41,223
You are crazy.

1395
01:04:41,598 --> 01:04:43,465
Today your head isn't working.

1396
01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:45,621
Go away or I'll kick you
in the ass.

1397
01:04:45,668 --> 01:04:47,768
Let's settle this thing, first.

1398
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:48,957
You'd better.

1399
01:04:53,409 --> 01:04:54,526
Listen up, boy,

1400
01:04:56,481 --> 01:04:58,027
why should I do it?

1401
01:04:58,246 --> 01:04:58,934
If I leave

1402
01:04:58,949 --> 01:05:00,246
being kicked by you
from this office.

1403
01:05:00,255 --> 01:05:01,446
I'll be back
soon

1404
01:05:01,447 --> 01:05:02,449
with the police!

1405
01:05:02,785 --> 01:05:03,809
Police?

1406
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:06,524
What does the police
have to do with it?

1407
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,963
I've understood something too

1408
01:05:07,964 --> 01:05:09,055
Don Pasquale Ronciglio

1409
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,060
and in certain situations

1410
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:11,274
everyone uses the weapons he can

1411
01:05:11,384 --> 01:05:13,282
and you do not just import rags

1412
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:14,782
And what do you know
about it?

1413
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:15,704
I know.

1414
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:17,516
The police still doesn't

1415
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:18,625
but I do.

1416
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,657
I know everything
that happens here.

1417
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:22,944
and dealing drugs isn't a game.

1418
01:05:23,165 --> 01:05:24,211
You know it well

1419
01:05:24,243 --> 01:05:25,250
is it not true?

1420
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:28,125
Sure.

1421
01:05:30,048 --> 01:05:31,188
I know it very well,

1422
01:05:31,446 --> 01:05:32,680
you are definitely right

1423
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:33,739
but there is no reason

1424
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,735
to make it a big deal.

1425
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:35,907
Work is one thing,

1426
01:05:36,009 --> 01:05:37,360
private matters another.

1427
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:38,938
No, for me there
is no difference.

1428
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,836
We just need to talk through
these things!

1429
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:42,610
Among people of honor

1430
01:05:42,626 --> 01:05:44,726
there must not be any
misunderstandings,

1431
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:45,809
and a woman

1432
01:05:45,831 --> 01:05:47,471
has never been so important,

1433
01:05:47,481 --> 01:05:48,434
for Pasquale Ronciglio,

1434
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:50,567
to push him to
compromise work

1435
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:52,372
and friendships.

1436
01:05:53,169 --> 01:05:54,020
Yup...

1437
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:55,700
I like Ninfarosa.

1438
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:56,559
I do not deny it.

1439
01:05:57,177 --> 01:05:58,075
But not to the point

1440
01:05:58,093 --> 01:05:59,583
to risk my position.

1441
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:02,340
You can keep her.

1442
01:06:02,638 --> 01:06:03,544
She's yours.

1443
01:06:07,825 --> 01:06:08,818
Then you assure me

1444
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:09,754
that you will not see her again?

1445
01:06:09,786 --> 01:06:10,465
Sure.

1446
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:11,551
On your honor?

1447
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:15,111
I assure you

1448
01:06:15,112 --> 01:06:15,912
that girl

1449
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:17,408
will no longer be a
reason for disagreement

1450
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:18,153
between us two.

1451
01:06:18,497 --> 01:06:20,090
Word of Pasquale Ronciglio.

1452
01:06:23,919 --> 01:06:24,817
Thank you.

1453
01:06:24,933 --> 01:06:26,053
Greetings, boy.

1454
01:06:33,246 --> 01:06:34,054
Come.

1455
01:06:43,348 --> 01:06:44,418
Come, come.

1456
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,738
Listen to me very well.

1457
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:54,418
I have a job for you.

1458
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:57,011
A job that will
have to be perfect.

1459
01:06:58,183 --> 01:06:59,738
You will have to get
rid of that young man...

1460
01:06:59,831 --> 01:07:00,902
... that young man

1461
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:02,277
forever.

1462
01:07:20,716 --> 01:07:21,763
Sorry

1463
01:07:22,263 --> 01:07:24,153
Does the Aliprandi
family live here?

1464
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,497
- Yes, on the third floor.
- Thank you.

1465
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:52,151
What do you want, my
son is not here.

1466
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:52,901
You...

1467
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:54,260
... are you Roberto's father?

1468
01:07:54,282 --> 01:07:55,276
And you are Ninfarosa!

1469
01:07:55,282 --> 01:07:56,204
For God's sake

1470
01:07:56,225 --> 01:07:57,468
forget it, it's serious!

1471
01:07:57,564 --> 01:07:58,978
- What is serious?
- Roberto!

1472
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,227
They want to kill him!

1473
01:08:00,352 --> 01:08:01,055
Kill?

1474
01:08:01,095 --> 01:08:02,482
Who wants
to kill my son?

1475
01:08:02,483 --> 01:08:03,852
Speak for God's sake!

1476
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:05,009
Pasquale Ronciglio!

1477
01:08:05,157 --> 01:08:05,837
Ronciglio?

1478
01:08:05,852 --> 01:08:07,029
and what does my son
have to do with him?

1479
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,063
with Ronciglio, speak!

1480
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:10,032
- He has worked for him for more than two months.
- For him?

1481
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:11,477
They must have had
a fight for me.

1482
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,751
Where is Roberto now?

1483
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:13,751
I heard that Tore

1484
01:08:13,774 --> 01:08:14,793
is supposed to take him
at sea

1485
01:08:14,794 --> 01:08:15,970
for a load of cigarettes.

1486
01:08:16,353 --> 01:08:17,548
In Santa Lucia, then

1487
01:08:17,564 --> 01:08:19,538
Ronciglio keeps his motorboats
there.

1488
01:08:19,681 --> 01:08:20,681
I'll come with you!

1489
01:08:20,853 --> 01:08:22,056
Get away from me!

1490
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,644
- Don Salvatore...
- Hello!

1491
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:35,870
- My regards.

1492
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:41,584
Are not you ready yet?

1493
01:08:41,741 --> 01:08:42,904
All right, don Salvatò,

1494
01:08:42,935 --> 01:08:43,881
all right.

1495
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:45,240
What's all this about?

1496
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,896
There were no scheduled
trips today.

1497
01:08:46,951 --> 01:08:48,216
Programs are dangerous

1498
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:49,362
they always end up

1499
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:50,871
at the ears of the wrong person.

1500
01:08:50,897 --> 01:08:52,201
There is a special
load over there

1501
01:08:52,249 --> 01:08:53,842
and it's up to us to pick it up.

1502
01:08:53,905 --> 01:08:54,881
Something wrong?

1503
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:57,256
No nothing, I was just saying.

1504
01:08:58,608 --> 01:08:59,896
Jump down, move!

1505
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:02,943
So, what are you waiting for?

1506
01:09:05,764 --> 01:09:06,857
Let's go!

1507
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,193
Go.

1508
01:10:26,053 --> 01:10:27,272
Don Francè, I'll go with you.

1509
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:28,600
No, go to the small pier.

1510
01:10:30,537 --> 01:10:31,380
Stop.

1511
01:10:31,554 --> 01:10:32,913
You are not allowed!

1512
01:10:37,224 --> 01:10:37,929
Stop!

1513
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:39,054
What do you want?

1514
01:10:51,469 --> 01:10:52,476
Get away!

1515
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:01,741
Hurry up, turn
the engine on

1516
01:11:01,742 --> 01:11:03,019
or I will shoot
you in the mouth!

1517
01:11:03,043 --> 01:11:04,488
Come on, hurry up,

1518
01:11:04,558 --> 01:11:05,380
do as I say

1519
01:11:05,381 --> 01:11:06,293
or I will kill you!

1520
01:11:06,379 --> 01:11:07,894
Come on, run, run!

1521
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:02,046
What are you doing?

1522
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,646
Do not waste time, hurry up!

1523
01:12:03,802 --> 01:12:04,802
Come on!

1524
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:07,396
Come on!

1525
01:12:09,787 --> 01:12:10,724
Faster!

1526
01:12:10,842 --> 01:12:11,927
Faster!

1527
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:13,529
You know where they are!

1528
01:12:13,818 --> 01:12:15,310
Go on, go, go!

1529
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:18,826
Faster. faster!

1530
01:12:46,273 --> 01:12:47,546
When will we get there?

1531
01:12:48,468 --> 01:12:49,624
In a quarter of an hour.

1532
01:12:49,725 --> 01:12:50,780
Are you in a hurry?!

1533
01:12:50,835 --> 01:12:52,632
We have all the time
we need.

1534
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:15,000
Come on!

1535
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:34,283
What's happened?

1536
01:13:35,158 --> 01:13:35,813
I do not know.

1537
01:13:35,814 --> 01:13:37,494
Maybe a problem
with the engine,

1538
01:13:37,504 --> 01:13:38,463
go, take a look

1539
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:39,650
You are good with these things, no?

1540
01:14:34,142 --> 01:14:35,063
Hurry!

1541
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:36,391
There is my son there!

1542
01:14:43,409 --> 01:14:44,533
Fast, hurry up!

1543
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:45,526
Hurry up!

1544
01:14:45,596 --> 01:14:46,409
Do not worry

1545
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:47,588
Roberto is also my friend.

1546
01:14:49,315 --> 01:14:50,166
Good,

1547
01:14:50,206 --> 01:14:51,119
it's done!

1548
01:14:51,893 --> 01:14:52,799
Pull over,

1549
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,041
that's him.

1550
01:14:56,276 --> 01:14:57,268
Fast, hurry up.

1551
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:04,744
Let's help him, let's help him!
Pull over, pull over!

1552
01:15:05,112 --> 01:15:06,135
Hurry up!

1553
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:18,611
Robè...

1554
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:29,752
Roberto,

1555
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:30,767
my son,

1556
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:32,275
tell me, what did
they do to you?

1557
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:33,674
What did they do to you, eh?

1558
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:35,017
Do not cry, dad.

1559
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:36,392
Yes, I cry.

1560
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:38,830
I cry, my son, I cry, I cry!

1561
01:15:38,924 --> 01:15:40,044
Yes..

1562
01:15:42,556 --> 01:15:43,244
No, no!

1563
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:44,081
No, my dear son

1564
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:45,906
I only have you,
do not leave me!

1565
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:48,517
Do not leave me, please,
my dear son!

1566
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:49,778
No, no!

1567
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:52,549
My dear son...

1568
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:56,853
Quick, run, run fast!

1569
01:15:56,963 --> 01:15:58,650
They have to save my son!

1570
01:16:39,384 --> 01:16:40,139
And now

1571
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:41,374
I would like to propose a toast

1572
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,157
to the health of Don
Pasquale Ronciglio

1573
01:16:43,189 --> 01:16:44,251
and to his fortune!

1574
01:16:44,335 --> 01:16:45,319
Congratulations don Pasquale!

1575
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:47,063
- Best wishes!
- Thanks, cheers to you!

1576
01:17:54,846 --> 01:17:55,963
You cooked him.

1577
01:17:56,643 --> 01:17:57,861
Now eat him!

1578
01:17:58,963 --> 01:17:59,807
I do not carry weapons

1579
01:17:59,824 --> 01:18:01,275
don Francesco Aliprandi.

1580
01:18:01,495 --> 01:18:02,391
You can not shoot

1581
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:03,478
a defenseless man.

1582
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:04,986
You can not do it.

1583
01:18:05,471 --> 01:18:06,908
You are a man of honor!

1584
01:18:07,385 --> 01:18:08,455
I have no weapons.

1585
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:10,510
You can not do it.

1586
01:18:14,299 --> 01:18:15,861
I am a finished man.

1587
01:18:16,205 --> 01:18:18,111
Find a gun and defend yourself.

1588
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:20,252
Because I want to kill you!

1589
01:18:22,416 --> 01:18:24,033
You can not, Don Francesco

1590
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,361
This is a good place

1591
01:18:26,565 --> 01:18:28,533
You can not do it
here, you can not!

1592
01:18:29,854 --> 01:18:32,033
Don Francè, look behind!

1593
01:18:38,723 --> 01:18:40,123
Out, out!

1594
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:44,128
Pasquale Ronciglio.

1595
01:19:38,664 --> 01:19:39,983
Piece of shit.

1596
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:58,045
My dear son...

1597
01:20:54,243 --> 01:20:55,618
Here, that's the ship!

1598
01:20:55,704 --> 01:20:57,369
You know, I know the captain

1599
01:20:57,397 --> 01:20:58,735
he is a friend, a Greek.

1600
01:20:58,923 --> 01:20:59,567
Yes, a Greek,

1601
01:20:59,582 --> 01:21:00,614
a man of honor,

1602
01:21:00,627 --> 01:21:01,824
one of those like us.

1603
01:21:01,844 --> 01:21:02,637
Thank you...

1604
01:21:07,661 --> 01:21:09,832
I'll deal with it.
I'll go and get back right away

1605
01:21:18,594 --> 01:21:19,773
Right away!

1606
01:21:22,485 --> 01:21:23,492
Yes.

1607
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:25,406
I must return.

1608
01:21:26,547 --> 01:21:28,647
I promised you that I
have to come back.

1609
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:35,500
My son...

1610
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:38,469
You're an important dad...

1611
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,961
All fathers
are important...

1612
01:21:41,055 --> 01:21:44,930
I raise the glass, to the
health of the new accountant...

1613
01:21:45,797 --> 01:21:47,008
I see you...

1614
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:48,313
My son...

1615
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:51,383
A terrible accident
a car hit him.

1616
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:52,508
No Roberto!

1617
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:56,453
- Were you good at school?
- Yes, dad!

1618
01:21:56,782 --> 01:21:58,182
Roberto.

1619
01:22:11,141 --> 01:22:12,680
Don Francè, all right!

1620
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:13,906
Don Francè!

1621
01:22:14,188 --> 01:22:15,117
Don Francè!

1622
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:17,766
Don Francè, all
right, all right!

1623
01:22:21,493 --> 01:22:22,805
Don Francè...

1624
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:39,587
You do not have to
worry, Nicolì.

1625
01:22:41,838 --> 01:22:42,845
You said it

1626
01:22:43,424 --> 01:22:44,564
It's all right.

1627
01:22:48,392 --> 01:22:49,783
You will see, I will come back.

1628
01:22:51,353 --> 01:22:52,650
What are you doing, are you crying?

1629
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:56,423
Do not cry,

1630
01:22:56,814 --> 01:22:58,314
do not cry Nicolì!

1631
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:01,993
Every man has his destiny.

1632
01:23:02,885 --> 01:23:04,251
It was written like this.

1633
01:23:05,775 --> 01:23:07,142
It was written like this.

1634
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:10,158
Nicolì...

1635
01:23:11,564 --> 01:23:12,595
Nicolì...

1636
01:24:01,646 --> 01:24:03,075
Goodbye, my Naples.

1637
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:07,921
How many sorrows you gave me...

1638
01:24:09,867 --> 01:24:12,030
But you will always
be in my heart.

1639
01:24:16,302 --> 01:24:17,739
Goodbye, my Naples.

1640
01:24:17,997 --> 01:24:19,117
Goodbye.
