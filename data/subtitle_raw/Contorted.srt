00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,234
With the change of circumstances
when we move there,

8
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,653
things could get better for you too,
don't you think?

9
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,739
You make it sound like
we're moving because of me.

10
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,619
I really don't want to move.

11
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,747
What else can we do?
We can't afford not to.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,047
I'm doing this for all of us
to live a better life.

13
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:10,923
But you...

14
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,676
What did you do?

15
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,971
Can't you see how much I am struggling
to keep afloat right now?

16
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,430
Hold on.

17
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,934
Ji-woo, I'm fine.
Go back to bed, sweetie.

18
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,730
Let's talk this through before you go.

19
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,274
No, let's talk later.

20
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,401
Is someone's funeral that important to you?

21
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,402
I said later.

22
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,449
Take the kids with you if you're going.

23
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,109
Myeong-hye

24
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:17,865
The person you're trying to reach
isn't available.

25
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:10,960
Mom...

26
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:16,919
Hee-woo.

27
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,588
Oh, Uncle...

28
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,888
Didn't you miss me?
You didn't even call.

29
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:34,353
I'd want for nothing else in this world
if I had a daughter like you.

30
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,152
When did you get here?

31
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,488
Here.

32
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,198
Oh...

33
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,033
I'll be going now.

34
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,368
- Okay, see you later.
- See you.

35
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,246
What happen to the CEO
wasn't your fault.

36
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,580
- I'll call you.
- Good luck with the move.

37
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,414
Okay.

38
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,457
Let's go.

39
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:00,879
Hee-woo, I'll visit you
at your new home sometime.

40
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,633
I have to go in now,
so hurry and follow your dad.

41
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,643
You saw them, didn't you?

42
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,811
What?

43
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,897
Things like them can hurt
you and your family.

44
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,900
If you ever need help later, call me.

45
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,487
Savior Kim

46
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,364
Okay?

47
00:07:54,474 --> 00:08:00,731
CONTORTED

48
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,208
You're awake.

49
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,294
We're almost done here,
so get some more rest.

50
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,275
Hey, Ji-woo.

51
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,491
I have a headache right now.

52
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,787
Hee-woo.

53
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,373
Choi Hee-woo!

54
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,387
Go play with your sister on the swing.

55
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,301
Oh, hey.

56
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,805
Look at all this. Wow.

57
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:43,393
The people who lived here before
left all these nice things behind.

58
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,811
Isn't it great?

59
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,731
Why would you accept used things?

60
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,149
I mean...

61
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,903
If you go around this way,
it's the master bedroom.

62
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,489
If you have a headache,
go in there and rest for a bit.

63
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,908
Not that way,
go around that way.

64
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,586
Let me know if you need anything.

65
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,465
Ji-woo, what's wrong?
What happened?

66
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,091
Did you fall?

67
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,094
Are you alright? Okay?

68
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,554
Where's your sister?

69
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,556
Where's your sister, Ji-woo?

70
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,016
Hee-woo!

71
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,351
Hee-woo!

72
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,771
Ji-woo, are you alright?

73
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,190
Hee-woo?
I don't see her.

74
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,651
Let me take a look at you.

75
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,653
Didn't you get hurt?

76
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,780
My poor baby.

77
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,576
How could you leave your sister alone here?

78
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,746
The shed is a bit strange.

79
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:51,164
What?

80
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,875
It feels like there's someone in there.

81
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,213
You two go back inside.
I'll go check.

82
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,258
What the...

83
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,760
Why did this fall off?

84
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,478
Huh?

85
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,320
There are strange noises
coming from the shed.

86
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:04,821
What?

87
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,115
There must be something in there.

88
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,328
Noises from the shed?

89
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,711
- I'll go check it out.
- Okay.

90
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,798
Don't worry.

91
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,173
Whatever.

92
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,104
This is the first day in our new home,

93
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,189
so be patient with us, okay?

94
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,775
Your mom will make
something really good tomorrow.

95
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,614
I'll cook.

96
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,786
- Dong-woo, where are you going?
- Thanks for dinner.

97
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,625
Dong-woo,
don't be on your phone for too long.

98
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,672
- Did you hear that?
- What?

99
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,300
There was a strange noise.

100
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,805
Did you hear that?

101
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,643
- Did you?
- Dong-woo.

102
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,521
Please walk with care.
Mom says it was too loud.

103
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:05,734
I told you to go see what's in the shed.

104
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,862
What's wrong with you?

105
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,656
Kids are getting anxious.
Please stop.

106
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,744
I couldn't find the key to the shed.

107
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,581
I'll ask the realtor about it,
so just wait a bit till then.

108
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,125
What if something happens?

109
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,169
Like what?

110
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,381
It's locked so tight that
not even a ghost or monster could get out.

111
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,426
What if it ends up coming out
when we open the door?

112
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,262
Just kidding.

113
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,390
Finish your food. I'll protect you,
so don't worry and eat.

114
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,902
Let's stop sighing and
just enjoy our dinner.

115
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:24,826
Hee-woo!

116
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,036
What's wrong?

117
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,372
Did something happen?

118
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,542
No.

119
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,502
It's okay.

120
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,254
Did you have a nightmare?

121
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,356
I asked if you had a nightmare!

122
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,316
Why won't you answer me?

123
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,402
I ended up like this because of you!

124
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,904
Just why won't you call me Mom?

125
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:02,864
Why?

126
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,462
I keep hearing strange noises
from the shed.

127
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,590
And my nightmares are getting worse.

128
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,554
I know I shouldn't,
but I blame everything on Hee-woo.

129
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:14,060
Whenever I look into her eyes,
I feel like she can read my mind.

130
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:17,730
We brought her home in the first place
because of her beautiful eyes,

131
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,234
but I'm afraid of how I might change.

132
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,705
Hee-woo,
you remember Sister Veronica, right?

133
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,125
She's going to be your mother
from now on.

134
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,836
Now say hello.

135
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,697
Shall we go camping and barbecue
in the front yard?

136
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,449
Yes?

137
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,161
What are you so happy about?

138
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,498
Oh, I was telling them
that we should go camping in our front yard.

139
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,918
Do something about the shed.

140
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,128
What about it?

141
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,214
I heard a strange sound again last night.

142
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,677
What sound?
I didn't hear anything.

143
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,764
Of course you didn't.

144
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:36,726
Dong-woo.

145
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,854
- Where are you going?
- Put your dishes in the sink.

146
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,356
It's okay, I'll do it later.

147
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,407
Hee-woo, did you hear anything
from the shed last night?

148
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,579
You really didn't hear it?

149
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,250
When I head out,
I'll stop by the real estate

150
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,044
and ask about the shed key.

151
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,094
Hee-woo.

152
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,931
You didn't hear it either, right?

153
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,352
Is there anything you need?

154
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,394
No.

155
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,604
You always say that.

156
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,397
It's okay to tell me
if you need something.

157
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,566
- I'm really fine.
- Really?

158
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,320
Alright. I'll be back.

159
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,696
See you later.

160
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,822
Okay.

161
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:32,406
Ultrasound Room

162
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,574
Let's go.

163
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,159
Goodbye.

164
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:37,995
Let's go.

165
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,539
Yes, it's me.

166
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,042
I just got tested.

167
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,420
Yes.

168
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,590
Let's talk at home.

169
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,554
Hee-woo,
should we get some ice cream on the way back?

170
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,597
Yes.

171
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:57,723
Okay.

172
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,535
Mom...

173
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,454
Can we play hide-and-seek?

174
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,752
You can't go outside, okay?

175
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:29,880
Go hide.

176
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:35,886
One...

177
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,558
Two...

178
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,894
Three...

179
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,357
Four...

180
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,361
Five...

181
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:55,740
Six...

182
00:26:58,326 --> 00:26:59,994
Seven...

183
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,416
Eight...

184
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,462
Nine...

185
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,257
Ten...

186
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,224
Here I come.

187
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:53,547
Hurry and run.
Hide and seek.

188
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,394
Where could you be?

189
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,899
I can smell Ji-woo here.

190
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,988
Is she here?

191
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,283
Got you!

192
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,357
Ji-woo!

193
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,735
Ji-woo!

194
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,615
Ji-woo!

195
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,870
Ji-woo!

196
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,383
It's me.

197
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,386
Where's Ji-woo?

198
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,434
Weren't you just talking to someone?

199
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:39,153
Stay with Ji-woo.

200
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,220
You must've just moved in.

201
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,686
Yes, we moved in yesterday.

202
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,106
Which house do you live in?

203
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,733
Over there.

204
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,741
I was close to the previous tenants.

205
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,497
What were they like?

206
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,251
Well...

207
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,548
They were just ordinary neighbors...

208
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,841
And nice...

209
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,137
At first.

210
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,935
But they just disappeared one day.

211
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,647
Isn't that strange?

212
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,404
I was actually in the middle of something.

213
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,660
It's upsetting to find out.

214
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,040
- What's up?
- Why?

215
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,961
I just thought you'd be bored.

216
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,714
Boo!

217
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,466
Go play your games.

218
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:30,889
They said

219
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,185
this house is a bit contorted,
not standing straight up.

220
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:39,565
That's why when the wind blows,

221
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:42,109
creak, creak...

222
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,448
It makes noises.

223
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:12,848
Hee-woo!

224
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,517
Hee-woo.

225
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,603
Wake up, Hee-woo!

226
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,897
Mom, will she be okay?

227
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,482
Yes, she'll be fine.

228
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,400
Oh no.

229
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:35,663
The person you're trying to reach
isn't available.

230
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,511
Hello, ma'am.

231
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:56,058
I called to ask if I could visit you
at your office today.

232
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,520
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not at my office right now.

233
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,271
I don't think I'll get back by today.

234
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,314
Oh, I see.

235
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:04,400
How unfortunate.
I'll see you some other time.

236
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,985
By the way, ma'am,

237
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:11,615
you know the publishing job
you talked about last time?

238
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,576
I was wondering how that's going.

239
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,203
Oh, right. You see...

240
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,041
Regardless of conditions,
I can definitely do the job.

241
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:24,336
You see, about that...
Don't get me wrong.

242
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:27,256
Because of that plagiarism claim issue...

243
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,842
Of course, I believe you 100%.

244
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:34,304
But the publisher seems to be under pressure...
You know, on this situation.

245
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,474
Even the CEO died in such a way.

246
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:42,271
Ma'am, I did not plagiarize.

247
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,398
I know that, of course.

248
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,776
I'm in the middle of a meeting right now,
so I'll call you later.

249
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,696
Okay then.
I'll talk to you later.

250
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,702
Gosh, what a headache.
Such an embarrassed.

251
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,120
Who was it?

252
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,913
No one important.

253
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,420
Hee-woo...

254
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,339
I’m sorry, but is there
a patient named Choi Hee-woo...

255
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,049
Never mind, I found it.

256
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,053
Sorry I'm late.
Is Hee-woo okay?

257
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:16,597
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

258
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,600
I had it on vibrate,
so I didn't know you called. I'm sorry.

259
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,518
What is wrong with you?

260
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,270
Why do you make things so difficult?

261
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,898
Okay, I'm sorry.

262
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,192
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

263
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,402
Look at what happened
as soon as we moved.

264
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,781
I'm doing my best here.
I said I'm sorry.

265
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,284
This is the best you can do?

266
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,411
What did they say about Hee-woo?

267
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:40,662
Uh...

268
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,290
Yes?

269
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,542
Could I have some water?

270
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,919
Water?

271
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,050
Are you alright?

272
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,887
Yes.
I'm sorry.

273
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:14,863
What?

274
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,324
You don't want me to go?

275
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:23,497
Don't open that door.

276
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:25,624
What?

277
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,209
The shed.

278
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,442
Are you okay?

279
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,070
Yes.

280
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,074
Oh.

281
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,956
This must be my lucky day.

282
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,422
What do you think you're doing?

283
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,676
I have bad depression.

284
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,222
And this helps with that.

285
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,057
You understand, right?

286
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,935
You can't smoke in someone's car.

287
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:35,235
Life without a husband or kids
would've been so much better.

288
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,615
Don't you think so?

289
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:44,870
Misfortune isn't something
that humans can fix.

290
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,419
Isn't it hard trying to act
like a good person?

291
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,797
What are you talking about?

292
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:01,386
Acting like you care for her
but resenting her on the inside.

293
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,431
That's bad.

294
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,142
Put out that cigarette now.

295
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,106
That's what's tormenting you.

296
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,532
Put it out!

297
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,279
What is all this?

298
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:11,081
Choi Dong-woo!

299
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,667
Come down here and
clean this mess up.

300
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:29,599
I can't stand this!
I'm so sick of this!

301
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,602
I hate this!

302
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:14,144
Hush, little baby

303
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,273
Don't say a word

304
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,778
Mama's gonna buy you

305
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,781
A mockingbird

306
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:35,999
The virus attacks the weakest part
of a living organism and infects it.

307
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:39,294
It infiltrates the cellular tissue
of the infected organism

308
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:42,547
and grows and propagates by plundering it.

309
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,841
Direct treatment is impossible in reality.

310
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,427
This is driving me nuts.

311
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,432
After the virus proliferates,
it comes out of the cell

312
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,350
and attacks another cell.

313
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,865
Hee-woo, don't be scared.

314
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:09,950
We're your friends.

315
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,328
She's trying to go in the shed.

316
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,163
Hurry and wake your father up.

317
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:16,873
Tell him to stop her.

318
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:24,798
It's too late.

319
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,194
I told you it's bad
to act like you don't resent her.

320
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,114
It's troubling and shameful,

321
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,157
isn't it?

322
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,618
Put the mask on.

323
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,539
Hide in there and be at ease.

324
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:27,379
No matter how cruel and corrupt you are,
you can hide it.

325
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,882
There's no need to act like a good person.

326
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,142
Just hide in there

327
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,187
and live in peace like me.

328
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,101
Have some of this too.

329
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,610
Should I tell Mom to come today?

330
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,655
No, it's okay.

331
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:24,954
Hee-woo.

332
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:29,125
You know Mom is a bit sick.

333
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,337
Never mind.

334
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,258
Do you want to know a secret?

335
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:39,302
Mom...

336
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,307
Hold on, I have to take this.

337
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,643
Yes, sir.

338
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,188
Oh, right.
I was actually going to call you.

339
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,151
When the money comes in,
I'll be sure to repay you first.

340
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,903
I'm sorry.

341
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,490
Yes, I'll let you know.

342
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,158
Yes, talk to you soon.

343
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:13,753
Hey, Dong-woo.

344
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,047
Dad, Mom won't wake up again.

345
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,590
I have to go to school today.

346
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,802
Okay, I will be there soon.

347
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:26,683
Thank you.

348
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:29,894
Dong-woo.

349
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,564
Dong-woo...

350
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:36,276
Where's Mom?

351
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:51,082
Get your backpack. Let's go.

352
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,376
Come on, Dong-woo.

353
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:56,838
Let's go.

354
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,666
Mom, you look pretty.

355
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:35,835
I look pretty?

356
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,921
Yes, very, very pretty.

357
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,384
Hee-woo.

358
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:48,056
I need to go the real estate.

359
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,557
Stay here and play with this.

360
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,433
Okay.

361
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,235
Hello, ma'am.

362
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,070
Oh, hello.

363
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:05,698
How did the move go?
What brings you here today?

364
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,660
I'd like the key to the shed, please.

365
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:09,702
- Shed?
- Yes.

366
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:13,831
Yes, there's a shed behind our house.
I'd like the key to that.

367
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,834
There was a key?

368
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,337
I am not sure I have one.
Hold on for a second.

369
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:23,299
I looked for it at home,
but it wasn't there.

370
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,302
Where could it be?

371
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,680
You know that
we kind of moved in a hurry.

372
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,975
But...
why was this house so cheap?

373
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,644
Well, you see...

374
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:37,897
There really is no key. Nothing.

375
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,899
I'll look into it and get back to you.

376
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,693
There aren't any other issues, right?

377
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,320
Well...

378
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:48,199
Actually, my wife

379
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:53,329
keeps saying she can hear
strange noises from the shed.

380
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,541
I'm sorry, but
I have to go out right now.

381
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,042
I'll give you a call after I look into it.

382
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,877
This isn't an urgent matter, is it?

383
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,087
But the key...

384
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:03,006
I mean, it is not that urgent. Right?

385
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,466
I'll look into it and let you know.

386
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,511
Give me a call, then.

387
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:09,887
Yes, of course. Goodbye.

388
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,764
- Please call me.
- Okay.

389
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,112
What were you doing?

390
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,619
Hello, Mr. Jang.

391
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,829
- How have you been, Mr. Choi?
- Good.

392
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,832
This publishing company I know
is looking for an author illustrator.

393
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:39,083
Oh, really?

394
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,127
So I called you right away.

395
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:42,587
Oh, thank you so much.

396
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:45,131
I've been so off the grid lately.

397
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:47,091
Thank you so much for calling me.

398
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,552
Okay. I'll get back to you
as soon as I get an answer from them.

399
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,429
Okay, thank you.

400
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,264
Goodbye. Thank you.

401
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,065
Dong-woo.

402
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,567
Dong-woo!
Don't you wanna say hi?

403
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,152
Hi.

404
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:07,987
Are you alright?

405
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,530
Yes.

406
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,062
Why are you just standing here?
Where's Dong-woo?

407
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,522
He went up to his room.

408
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:49,112
You're home.

409
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,863
Yeah. What's going on?

410
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:53,074
What makes you so happy?

411
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:55,493
What? You don't like it?

412
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:59,872
Of course I like it.
It's just that it's been a while.

413
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,334
You were right about moving here.

414
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,795
I feel much refreshed,
and have no headache.

415
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,589
Really? That's a relief.

416
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:10,425
Shall we?

417
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:14,137
Hurry over.
Let's enjoy the meal.

418
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,647
Here you go.

419
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,859
Hee-woo, eat up.

420
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,403
Dong-woo, come on down.

421
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,951
- Go ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

422
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:44,542
How is it?

423
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,005
Uh... it's... good...

424
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:52,508
Eat up.

425
00:51:18,785 --> 00:51:20,077
Choi Hee-woo!

426
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,546
Hee-woo.

427
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,300
I think...

428
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:38,805
we need to make more effort
to understand your mom.

429
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:46,354
She may get better while staying here.

430
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,441
And about your school?

431
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:55,738
You can go when you get better.

432
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,241
- Okay.
- Okay.

433
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,205
And can I ask you about one more thing?

434
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:10,419
When you were alone in the car
this afternoon,

435
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,673
you seemed to be talking.

436
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:17,510
It looked like
you were talking to someone.

437
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,220
What was that about?

438
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:23,558
I was practicing speaking to friends.

439
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:26,519
Really?

440
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,020
Yes.

441
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,232
You want to sleep?

442
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,946
Let me know if you need anything.

443
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:07,787
Is that so?

444
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,873
Are you so happy with that?

445
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,336
I should try it too?

446
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,049
Then of course.

447
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:24,178
Well...

448
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:28,516
I'll do it soon.

449
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:10,808
They say this house is contorted.

450
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,355
I said this house is contorted.

451
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,696
Can an incompetent and indecisive

452
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:27,575
coward like you
take care of our children?

453
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,042
Just keep on sleeping.

454
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,919
It suits you.

455
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,576
I'm going out.

456
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:17,958
What?

457
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,419
Are you alright?

458
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,715
I'm doing great.

459
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:03,587
Mom.

460
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,091
Mommy.

461
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,568
Happy Real Estate

462
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,201
Hey, Yeong-gyu,
it's me.

463
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:37,121
Could you look into something for me?

464
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,331
You know the place we moved into?

465
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,459
Could you look into that house for me?

466
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,628
I'll tell you more when we meet.

467
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,214
Yes. I'll text you the address.

468
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:49,091
Please get on it as fast as you can.

469
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,885
Yeah. Sorry about that.

470
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:55,139
The house was built six years ago
by a guy named Park Sang-ho.

471
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,640
As soon as he completed the house,

472
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,934
he suddenly died from Gramoxone.

473
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,062
His eldest and third kids also died from it.

474
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,815
His wife is also mentioned in there.

475
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,193
Something was strange about his wife.

476
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,404
She took out multiple insurances
on her husband and kids.

477
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,615
And this may be unrelated,

478
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,617
but the kids were all adopted.

479
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,786
Anyway, they started an investigation,

480
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,664
but there was no proof of crime.

481
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,542
So the cops were about to wrap it up

482
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,670
when the middle child suddenly
called the police, asking for help.

483
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,464
So the cops were dispatched to the house,

484
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,132
but no one was there.

485
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:33,802
That's strange.
Did somebody do that on purpose?

486
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:44,021
A young couple with two kids
moved in there last year.

487
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:47,441
They killed their kids
and committed suicide together.

488
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:51,570
Their kids were also adopted.

489
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,657
This was just before you moved in.

490
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,408
You didn't hear anything about it?

491
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:03,499
I didn't hear anything about that
when we moved in.

492
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,919
I have a bad feeling about it.

493
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:09,046
Why don't you just move out of that house?

494
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,424
I don't have the money right now.

495
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:19,014
I wish I could help. I'm sorry.

496
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,891
No, why are you sorry?

497
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,518
I'm the one who's sorry.

498
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,230
Thanks for looking into it.

499
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:30,943
Hee-woo.

500
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,362
Where's your mom?

501
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:35,281
She went out.

502
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,546
The person you're trying to reach
isn't available.

503
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,768
Dong-woo, Hee-woo.

504
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,744
Hee-woo, it's time for dinner.

505
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:25,164
I'm coming in.

506
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,007
Hee-woo.

507
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:18,717
Choi Hee-woo!

508
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,215
What is all this?

509
01:01:58,257 --> 01:01:59,800
I got dinner for us.

510
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:02,511
Stop feeding the kids instant food like this.

511
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:04,930
I got something delicious,
so wait just a minute.

512
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,882
Hee-woo, if you don't want to eat this,
you don't have to.

513
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,968
Okay?
You can just eat the rice.

514
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,393
It's an insurance policy.

515
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,562
She's just like the woman who killed us.

516
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:57,441
Run away. She'll kill you too.

517
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:00,652
After killing you...

518
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:03,739
Dong-woo,
I brought something delicious.

519
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,408
Why aren't you eating?

520
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,913
This is so good.

521
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,966
Open wide.

522
01:03:24,218 --> 01:03:25,302
Come on.

523
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,473
Myeong-hye, stop it.

524
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,392
It's okay.

525
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,394
I'll eat it.

526
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:38,190
Open wide.

527
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:41,068
Open.

528
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:10,991
What is this?

529
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,579
The kids could get hurt.

530
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,292
Since we're so pressed for money,
we must prepare ahead.

531
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,918
Yes, we're pressed for money,

532
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:25,213
and you think we can afford that?

533
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:33,305
Who knows what'll happen?

534
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:35,515
We have to think of Ji-woo and
Dong-woo too.

535
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:37,768
You're incompetent.

536
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:41,021
Myeong-hye.

537
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,191
What's wrong with you?

538
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:46,777
What do you mean?

539
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,156
You are not okay right now.

540
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,408
Are you off your meds?

541
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,664
Myeong-hye's getting strange again.

542
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,167
Where did it all go wrong?

543
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,504
I really don't know
what to do anymore.

544
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:51,883
You scared me!

545
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:56,888
Did you do something wrong?

546
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,725
It's late, I thought you are sleeping.

547
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:04,146
So that's where this book was.

548
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,275
Ji-woo was looking for it all day.

549
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,609
Ji-woo?

550
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:12,654
Did you not take your meds again?

551
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:15,866
You know how much
Ji-woo loves this book.

552
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:17,617
You should've asked before taking it.

553
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:19,369
Myeong-hye, look at me.

554
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,998
Please get a hold of yourself.

555
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:23,999
Ji-woo...

556
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,088
Huh?

557
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,624
Let's be honest here.

558
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:10,045
Didn't that insurance policy
get you excited?

559
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:15,717
The publishing company CEO

560
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,804
committed suicide
because of your plagiarism.

561
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,370
You did great. Good job.

562
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,367
Savior Kim

563
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,382
Hello?

564
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:04,052
Sir, please help me.

565
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:06,096
I can't hear you. Who is this?

566
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,474
We met at the funeral home.

567
01:11:09,516 --> 01:11:11,309
You gave me your business card.

568
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:11,977
What are you doing?

569
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:12,894
Who is this?

570
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:24,489
What were you doing?

571
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:27,909
Did you call the sister at the orphanage?

572
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,120
It's nothing.

573
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,871
What do you mean, it's nothing?

574
01:11:49,014 --> 01:11:52,726
Hee-woo,
you must be hungry.

575
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,062
Let's eat.

576
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,065
Honey, Hee-woo says she's hungry.

577
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:16,041
Gramoxone

578
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:41,649
Here you go.

579
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:47,072
Eat up, Hee-woo.

580
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,157
You must eat and get strong.

581
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:04,380
What?

582
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:08,843
I'm not hungry.

583
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:10,678
Really?

584
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,975
Then we should wake Dong-woo and Ji-woo
so they can eat this.

585
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:28,029
You're such a good girl, Hee-woo.

586
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:30,740
Eat up.

587
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,701
Eat so you won't get sick again.

588
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:50,677
Eat it.

589
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,262
Eat it!

590
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,514
Eat it!

591
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,311
Choi Hee-woo!

592
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:19,122
Hee-woo, can you call me Dad?

593
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:32,969
Say Dad.

594
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,471
Please don't kill me.

595
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:38,099
Call me Dad!

596
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:45,064
Don't kill her.

597
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,778
I'm going to finish her off.

598
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:52,906
Hey, guys.

599
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:55,950
Ji-woo, Dong-woo,
let's go upstairs.

600
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:59,245
Hee-woo did something wrong,
so she must be punished.

601
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:04,834
Mom, what's wrong with you?

602
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:06,920
Go upstairs.

603
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,838
Now!

604
01:15:13,176 --> 01:15:16,304
She was the one who threw and
killed Ji-woo.

605
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:55,176
Do you know how much trouble
you put me through all this time?

606
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:56,761
Huh? Do you?

607
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:04,769
Choi Hee-woo.

608
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,188
Come here.

609
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:09,357
Come over here.

610
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:11,693
Don't kill me.

611
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:15,029
Answer me.

612
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,831
Get over here, Choi Hee-woo!

613
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:26,958
Hee-woo!

614
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:28,751
Hee-woo!

615
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:35,591
Dong-woo!

616
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:36,634
Come here.

617
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,761
Dong-woo!

618
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,724
Choi Hee-woo! Stop there!

619
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:45,810
Choi Hee-woo!

620
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:49,731
Open the door, Dong-woo.

621
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:51,316
Dong-woo!

622
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:54,694
Dong-woo!

623
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:09,917
Stop right there!

624
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,011
What's wrong with you, Mom?

625
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:22,013
Don't do that to Hee-woo.

626
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:23,598
Go play with Ji-woo.

627
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,075
Reporter Kang Yeong-gyu

628
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:35,253
Hyun-min

629
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:37,296
The person you're trying to reach
isn't available.

630
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,178
Uncle, it's Hee-woo.

631
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:45,972
Mom and Dad are acting strange.

632
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,390
Please help me.

633
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,562
Hyun-min

634
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,993
Reporter Kang Yeong-gyu

635
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,799
Hee-woo.

636
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,346
Hee-woo.

637
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,891
Hee-woo.

638
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:17,605
Hee-woo.

639
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,691
Choi Hee-woo.

640
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:30,910
Hee-woo.

641
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:34,455
Hee-woo.

642
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,108
Hee-woo.

643
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:15,830
Hee-woo.

644
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:40,855
Mommy, save me.

645
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,358
Please save me.

646
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,193
Mom!

647
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,656
Mom!

648
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:54,327
Mom.

649
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:58,831
Please...

650
01:21:58,873 --> 01:21:59,874
Mom?

651
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,126
Save me...

652
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:08,674
Go play with your sister on the swing.

653
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:10,718
Please save me!

654
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:13,596
You can't go outside, okay?

655
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:15,181
Go hide.

656
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:17,808
Mom!

657
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,602
Yes, she'll be fine.

658
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:30,821
No!

659
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,162
I'll kill you all!

660
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:41,957
Let go of me!

661
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:02,913
Mom, please stop.

662
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,669
You're just tired from taking care of us.

663
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:11,338
You're sick because of trying so hard.

664
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:19,346
You love us.

665
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,560
You want to do more for us,

666
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,564
but you can't, so you're upset.

667
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:32,902
Mom, I love you.

668
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:36,864
Please come back.

669
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:39,450
Mom. No!

670
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,375
Mom!

671
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:54,006
Mom...

672
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:58,719
Gramoxone

673
01:25:05,351 --> 01:25:06,519
Mom.

674
01:25:09,522 --> 01:25:11,023
Mom. No!

675
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:13,776
No!

676
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,411
Mom...

677
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:55,693
Dong-woo.

678
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,696
Dong-woo, are you alright?

679
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:00,823
I'm okay.

680
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:03,409
What about Hee-woo?
Where is she?

681
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,286
I don't know.

682
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:08,372
Dong-woo,
get in my car and stay there.

683
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:10,749
Hee-woo!

684
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,501
Hee-woo!

685
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,297
Hee-woo!

686
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:19,592
Hee-woo, are you okay?

687
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:21,051
Where's your mom?

688
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,219
Where's your dad?

689
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,265
Hee-woo, it's okay.

690
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:29,018
Everything will be okay.

691
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:34,356
It's okay.
