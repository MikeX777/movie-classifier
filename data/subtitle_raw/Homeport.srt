00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,140
Home Port

2
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,470
﻿Hello, Tali.
- Hello.

3
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,040
﻿I thought we agreed that you
would keep the unions in check,

4
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,680
﻿and allow me to promote the move
with Giladi for the good of port.

5
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,360
﻿I thought you were a man of your word.
- The good of the port.

6
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,660
﻿That's a hell of a phrase
for privatization.

7
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,500
﻿Ben Ami, I have made a deal with you
and I will make any deal your want,

8
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,560
﻿so long as you don't touch
my employees.

9
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,770
﻿Let him in.
- Okay

10
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
﻿Aaron?

11
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,480
﻿What are you doing here, son?

12
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,450
﻿It's my first day.

13
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,420
﻿What's going on here?

14
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,450
﻿What do you mean? This is our new
head of the Marine Department.

15
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
﻿Really?

16
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,190
﻿That's nice.

17
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,860
﻿Don't you forget,
I hold the on/off switch.

18
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,300
﻿Good luck, son.
- Thank you.

19
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,651
﻿Ben Bassat. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. -Avitan.

20
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,380
﻿We all know there isn't
another seaman such as yourself,

21
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,110
﻿and that the department
is in good hands.

22
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,980
﻿Just one thing,
it's about people, too.

23
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,920
﻿Not just sea and machinery, right?
So try to be a little gentle.

24
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,520
﻿Good luck to you.
Good luck, Avitan.

25
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,190
﻿Cheers. -Cheers, guys.
Cheers, cheers.

26
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,890
﻿Help yourselves, guys.
Help yourselves.

27
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,206
﻿You still haven't
handed me those forms.

28
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,606
﻿I haven't forgotten.
- It's not him, it's me.

29
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,510
﻿You had it mixed up.
- So why isn't it here yet?

30
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,030
﻿You promised you'd bring it.

31
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,500
﻿No, I can't wait another week.

32
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
﻿What do you mean?
Those are my stuff, I need them.

33
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,140
﻿Yelena, darling? It's Azulay.

34
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,750
﻿This is our new head of the
Marine Department,

35
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,220
﻿you can't keep him hanging.
Alright. Alright.

36
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,150
﻿See her first thing in the morning,
you'll get the VIP treatment.

37
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,690
﻿Azulay, is everything alright?

38
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,230
﻿I find out about
you working here from Ben Ami?

39
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,430
﻿I've known you since the day you were
born, we're family, have you no shame?

40
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,170
﻿Azualy, this is...
- This is what?

41
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,270
﻿One thing led to another,
and I didn't know I'd be coming back

42
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,540
﻿until the last minute.
Forget it, it's bullshit.

43
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,110
﻿You're right, I...
I apologize. I'm sorry.

44
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,020
﻿After 30 years at sea,
I've decided

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,640
﻿that I would like to try
and earn my family back.

46
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
﻿My daughter, Tali.

47
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,360
﻿Did you know I have
a new granddaughter?

48
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,460
﻿I heard. Congratulations.

49
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,400
﻿Look.
- That's nice.

50
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,440
﻿Look, if anyone gives you any trouble,
come straight to me,

51
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,980
﻿I'm warning you.
Have to keep an eye on things,

52
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,760
﻿we are all walking
a fine line around here.

53
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,260
﻿What about what we talked about,
about the tugboat crews?

54
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,030
﻿They're good kids,
they can barely make ends meet.

55
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,860
﻿So what? They have a new manager now,
it's not your concern.

56
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,100
﻿First of all,
every employee is my concern.

57
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,200
﻿Secondly, why should they suffer
until their new boss settles in

58
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,810
﻿and figure out what's what?
- What is that supposed to mean?

59
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,180
﻿We both know they take their time
with the unloading,

60
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,550
﻿for the 150 percent premiums
I pay them for overtime.

61
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,226
﻿What do a couple of logistic workers
taking a short break have to do

62
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,196
﻿with the Marine Department
tugboat crew's salaries?

63
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,620
﻿It has everything to do with that.

64
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,350
﻿You will be the end of them
with your conduct.

65
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,720
﻿Giladi and I are waiting
for an answer.

66
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,466
﻿You give it to me, and then maybe
I'll find the time to talk about

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,600
﻿the tugboat crew's salaries.
- You just keep waiting.

68
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,046
﻿Why didn't you tell me you were
the new head of the Marine Department?

69
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,340
﻿I never got around to it.

70
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,280
﻿The deed fell of that one.
Is it yours?

71
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,810
﻿Let's see.

72
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,810
﻿Hold on...

73
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,590
﻿Yes, it's mine.

74
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
﻿What is it?

75
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,260
﻿The first color mini-TV, 1985.

76
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,960
﻿Cheburashka.
- Right.

77
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,630
﻿I know who that is.

78
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,600
﻿I'm here to make sure
all is well.

79
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,170
﻿Is it taken care of?

80
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,140
﻿Big time. Thanks, Azulay.
- Good.

81
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
﻿Go on, anchors up.
Life is short.

82
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,580
﻿Alright, we're done here.
I'll leave it open for you.

83
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,620
﻿Pick up your stuff
and I'll close up later, okay?

84
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,790
﻿No problem.

85
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,760
﻿I know about every little thing
that goes on here,

86
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,530
﻿so there's nothing for you
to worry about.

87
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,740
﻿Son of a bitch. Azulay!

88
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,070
﻿Azulay!

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,310
﻿Azulay! Take your piece of shit
of a car and get out of here!

90
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,960
﻿What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

91
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,460
﻿What a piece of shit!

92
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,030
﻿Stay out of it.

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,800
﻿I told that guy a thousand times
to stay away from the department,

94
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,046
﻿so this is where he decides
to clean his car?

95
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,570
﻿If you don't apologize
and make it up to Azulay right now,

96
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,740
﻿I will call the police.
Did you hear me?

97
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,310
﻿This is the last time you use violence
in my department.

98
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,310
﻿Is that clear?
- Alright, alright. You're right.

99
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,730
﻿I don't know what came over me.
- What a jerk...

100
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,290
﻿Azul ay! I'm sorry.

101
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,590
﻿It was an accident, it slipped out
of your hand. I saw it, it's alright.

102
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460
﻿Get back to work.

103
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,300
﻿Shabbat Shalom, Mom.

104
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,140
﻿Shabbat Shalom.
- Shabbat Shalom.

105
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,310
﻿Here. -Shabbat Shalom.
- Here...

106
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,780
﻿Are you Ronen?
- Hello, Aaron.

107
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,750
﻿I understand you work at the port
as well. -In the tugboat crew.

108
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,680
﻿Where were you before you joined us?
- Ronen, where is her bib?

109
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,220
﻿In the kitchen.
- Can you get it for me?

110
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
﻿Sure.

111
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,230
﻿Would you like some more?

112
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,990
﻿She's so cute.

113
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,130
﻿Hello, Sivan. Is this your ball?
Is this your ball, or mine?

114
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,616
﻿Have a seat and eat something,
so it doesn't get cold.

115
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,270
﻿Is it yours? -Sit over there.
I'll prepare a plate for you.

116
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,980
﻿Here's the bib.

117
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,390
﻿What? What?
What do you want?

118
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,160
﻿What do you want?
Do you want a carrot?

119
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
﻿Thank you.

120
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,870
﻿Here, have another carrot.

121
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,860
﻿Tali, sweetheart,
I completely forgot.

122
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,320
﻿Brurya needs me for an emergency
this Monday,

123
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,466
﻿to help with preparations
for her daughter's wedding.

124
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,730
﻿I won't be able to babysit for you,
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,036
﻿Grandma, what's the matter with you?

126
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,780
﻿You know that's the day
I have night school.

127
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,670
﻿I can help you out, I'm free.

128
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,100
﻿No.

129
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,086
﻿I wouldn't want you to miss
your classes. -No, no.

130
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,810
﻿It's alright,
just change my shift.

131
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,440
﻿Okay.

132
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,250
﻿Lift up your glass.

133
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,150
﻿To the port!
- To the port.

134
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,560
﻿Go on.

135
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,400
﻿Nice. Another one.
Cheers. -Cheers.

136
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,510
﻿Do you know who I miss sometimes?

137
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,340
﻿Your father, God rest his soul.

138
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,150
﻿Morris was a hell of a man.
One hell of a man!

139
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,110
﻿How could he have just died on us
like that at 40 years old?

140
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,090
﻿Look, Azulay.

141
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,990
﻿About what happened with Kravitz...

142
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,960
﻿I really am sorry.
- No, it's alright.

143
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,690
﻿Forget it, it's nothing.
- No, it isn't.

144
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,106
﻿It's nothing, I'm telling you.
Forget it.

145
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,070
﻿He was out of line,
but just between you and me,

146
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,440
﻿you waltz in with your Buick...
- My Buick? Is that the problem?

147
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,310
﻿Everytime I give an Ashdod local
a job, they yell "corruption".

148
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,086
﻿As if those guys up there,
sitting in their comfy offices,

149
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,910
﻿aren't stuffing their pockets
every other day,

150
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,080
﻿with social benefits.
- You have turned this port into a joke.

151
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,980
﻿I've only been here a week,

152
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,666
﻿and there hasn't been one day without
an unloading problem of some sort.

153
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,490
﻿I don't want to talk about that.
- Just between us. -Here, let's drink.

154
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
﻿Cheers.

155
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,400
﻿No, no, it's on me.
- Forget it.

156
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,770
﻿Aaron, listen to me,

157
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,340
﻿you are one of us.
- Good night, Azulay.

158
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,740
﻿You are a local, don't forget that.
Good night. Take care.

159
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,620
﻿What was your name again?
Aaron Avitan?

160
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,430
﻿I don't see you on the list.
Are you a freelance worker?

161
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,076
﻿Are you for real? This is the new head
of the Marine Department,

162
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,500
﻿the new head of Logistics.
Talk to Rina in Personnel.

163
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,270
﻿Rina? I have an Aaron Avitan
at the gate. He's not on the list.

164
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,670
﻿It's okay, let him in.
- Okay.

165
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,880
﻿Thanks a lot. Do you need a lift?
I can take you to Customs.

166
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
﻿Sure.

167
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,130
﻿Well, good luck in your new job.
- Thank you very much.

168
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,810
﻿Oh, I have that Cheburashka
that you liked.

169
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,580
﻿Here, I want you to have it.

170
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,180
﻿Thank you.

171
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,310
﻿Do you have another container
full of funny stuff?

172
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,910
﻿I actually do, my yacht
is full of stuff I'm getting rid of.

173
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,380
﻿Do you need a coffee table
by any chance?

174
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,890
﻿No. -Why?
It's nice, it's wood.

175
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,790
﻿It's as good as new,
it would be a waste to throw it away.

176
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,910
﻿Come and take a look, if you like it,
I'll bring it to your place. -Okay.

177
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,830
﻿Thank you.
- My pleasure.

178
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,060
﻿Goodbye.
- Have a nice day.

179
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,500
﻿Didn't you hear me?
Start up the engine, let's set sail.

180
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,940
﻿Didn't you hear me? No.

181
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,510
﻿Wasn't it enough?
Didn't you get the message?

182
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,310
﻿You guys didn't
get the message.

183
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,850
﻿No more slacking around.

184
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,840
﻿And you will pay for that, too.
- Kravitz, what's going on?

185
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,520
﻿Why aren't you on your way
to pull the shipin?-! tried.

186
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,860
﻿Those assholes don't want to set sail
because of the waves.

187
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,430
﻿Elfasi, can you please come here?

188
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,710
﻿Look, Elfasi,

189
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,290
﻿the Marine Department
isn't just any department.

190
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,210
﻿It's the best department.
It's a privilege to be working here.

191
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,050
﻿It's good you're here, Azulay.

192
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,360
﻿Have a word with that tight-ass.

193
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,560
﻿He wants us to set sail
in 6 feet high waves.

194
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,240
﻿The new manager has balls
and you guys are complaining?

195
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,650
﻿What's the matter with you?
Are you scared of a couple of waves?

196
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,280
﻿Come on, everyone set sail! Now!

197
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,670
﻿Take your friend, for example.

198
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
﻿Do you know where he was two years ago?
I dragged him out of the sewer.

199
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,580
﻿I did everything I could
to get him back to the port.

200
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,110
﻿He graduated from the Naval Academy
with honors. -Right.

201
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,740
﻿What's become of him
is a real tragedy.

202
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,350
﻿What's on your mind, son?
Talk to me.

203
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,850
﻿Honestly, I don't like it.

204
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,290
﻿I have to be able to get my crew
to set sail without you intervening.

205
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,560
﻿You're absolutely right.

206
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,770
﻿You saw how I got them on their feet.
- Avitan, everything's ready.

207
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,540
﻿I'll be right there, Gabriel.
Meet me at the tugboat.

208
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,260
﻿Come on, get off.

209
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,670
﻿Have you forgotten the shit
I've dragged you out of?

210
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,210
﻿Is that all you've got on you?
Go on, give it here.

211
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,810
﻿I'm sorry, Azulay.
It won't happen again.

212
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,700
﻿What do you think?
It's nice, isn't it?

213
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,500
﻿It's handmade.

214
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
It﻿'s very nice.

215
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,310
﻿Is it steady?
- Come on, come aboard.

216
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,780
﻿I bet I'm the first woman here.

217
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,580
﻿You'll be surprised, but you're not.

218
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,220
﻿But she had enough. Yeah.
Of Ashdod, of the sea, and of me.

219
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,490
﻿But our daughter is here.
She's grown up.

220
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,990
﻿How about you?

221
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,130
﻿I'll tell you all about it
if you ask me out properly. -Okay.

222
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,530
﻿Alright, my husband is long gone.

223
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,130
﻿I'm sorry to hearthat.
- I'm not.

224
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,770
﻿Let's get off this thing
before we drown.

225
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,370
﻿There's nothing to worry about,
believe me.

226
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,540
﻿So what is this piece of junk?

227
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,780
﻿I bought it for pennies years ago.

228
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,950
﻿I promised Nicole at the time...
- Nicole?

229
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,150
﻿Your former wife?

230
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,190
﻿That's not an Israeli name.
- It's Dutch.

231
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,620
﻿Anyway, the plan was...
you know,

232
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,860
﻿to fix the yacht up and to set sail,
as a family.

233
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,460
﻿It never happened.

234
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,930
﻿I came back for my daughter.
To be with her.

235
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,370
﻿I left a nautical career.
30 years, it's a big deal.

236
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,310
﻿What?

237
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,640
﻿Don't you have a test today?

238
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,620
﻿Grandma, where are you?

239
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,260
﻿What is he doing here?

240
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,260
﻿Are you kidding me?

241
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,830
﻿What difference does it make?

242
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,600
﻿I'm here to help you.

243
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,300
﻿Aaron, I really appreciate
you coming here, but it won't do.

244
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
﻿Why are you so angry with me?

245
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,410
﻿It's been so many years.

246
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,120
﻿Okay.

247
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,120
﻿Look, she's asleep
and she shouldn't wake up, okay?

248
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,260
﻿If she does,
if she even makes a peep,

249
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,996
﻿call Grandma right away
and tell her to come over,

250
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,781
﻿or give me a call, I'm not very far
from here, okay? It's just a test.

251
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,230
﻿I won't be gone for long, alright?

252
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,470
﻿But if she wakes up,
call me right away. -No problem.

253
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,260
﻿Aaron?

254
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,640
﻿I know it's none of my business,
but this is completely unsafe.

255
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,540
﻿You've got three burnt fuses here.
Look at this.

256
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,740
﻿It's all charred.

257
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,780
﻿You've got a baby at home.

258
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,071
﻿You have to tell Ronen to check the
power circuits every now and then.

259
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,550
﻿Haven't we discussed this already?

260
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,330
﻿You can only wear work boots
on the tugboat,

261
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,930
﻿not sneakers,
are you insane?

262
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,070
﻿It's just shoes, Aaron.
Don't be such a tight ass.

263
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,580
﻿I may be new here at the port,
but I've spent 30 years at sea.

264
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,940
﻿You'd lose your job indefinitely
over this at the ships.

265
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,070
﻿Is that how it is?
- Listen to me, smart ass,

266
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
﻿take your guys,
and you've got five minutes

267
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,810
﻿to get back here
with work boots on.

268
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,250
﻿Aaron, am I okay?
- Yes, great.

269
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,890
﻿Thanks, Elfasi.

270
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,030
﻿Azulay
-Berko.

271
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,906
﻿You remember him, his mother is the
Romanian who owns the shoe store.

272
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,506
﻿You were in the Naval Academy
together, remember?

273
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,900
﻿I know him.
- That's good.

274
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,100
﻿He was also assistant marina manager
in Ashkelon.

275
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,500
﻿He was fired, you know how crappy
things are these days.

276
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,170
﻿Give him a job
on the tugboat crew.

277
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,700
﻿What does he know about tugboats?
- He's a seaman.

278
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,080
﻿He's also from Ashdod.
Give him a chance. -Seaman?

279
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,890
﻿30 years ago, in the Kishon Delta,
he puked his guts out on a pedal boat.

280
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,180
﻿What will I do with him?
- Two courses and he's great.

281
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,220
﻿Besides, his brother has
a lot of power in the union,

282
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,660
﻿and we may need him in the future.
- So what, Azulay?

283
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,466
﻿It's the most professional
department we've got.

284
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,660
﻿Alright, give me a break, Aaron, give
him a job as a department attendant

285
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,200
﻿and call it a day.
- Kravitz is my department attendant.

286
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,646
﻿I don't have another
department attendant post.

287
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,246
﻿Alright, so? If someone needs help,
we help them out.

288
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,830
﻿If there isn't a post,
we'll create one.

289
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,480
﻿You remember Aaron.

290
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,280
﻿How are you?
- Great, and you?

291
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,590
﻿Fine. -He really is
a great seaman. Excellent.

292
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,590
﻿Besides, a logistics man will help us
keep this port in order.

293
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,160
﻿Sure thing. -Go wait for me
in the car. -Alright.

294
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,960
﻿See you.
- Goodbye.

295
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,500
﻿Give him a chance.

296
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,270
﻿My son and his wife
packed the little ones up,

297
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,810
﻿and went on a coast to coast trip.

298
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,540
﻿They left the eldest with me.
He's a wild one, I'm telling you.

299
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,380
﻿So the teacher
gives me a call and says:

300
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,720
﻿"Mr. Azulay, your grandson
is disturbing the class".

301
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,420
﻿So I said: "Mali, that kid has been
disturbing me all summer,

302
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,160
"have I ever given you a call?"

303
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,230
﻿Alright...

304
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,670
﻿Now that I've gotten you this great
department attendant,

305
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,170
﻿let's give a nice farewell
to Mr. Kravitz.

306
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,800
﻿He's my best worker.
- But he's management.

307
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,816
﻿He's getting in my way
of helping the employees.

308
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,546
﻿And I should get rid of an employee
for that reason?

309
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,640
﻿I don't work that way.

310
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,210
﻿Who will take care of us
if we don't look after ourselves?

311
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,150
﻿Those guys sitting in their
comfy offices in suits and ties?

312
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,080
﻿We are at war here.
I need him, I need his brother.

313
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,130
﻿I'll be wanting to pull the plug
on this place in a day or two.

314
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,520
﻿Azulay, it's the end of the day,
we are both tired,

315
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,600
﻿believe me, you won't remember a word
of what you said tomorrow morning.

316
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,170
﻿I'm sorry, Avitan. This isn't
your decision, this is an order.

317
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,700
﻿An order? Are you nuts?
He's my best worker.

318
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,440
﻿Maybe, but the man is violent.

319
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,916
﻿We were lucky the windshield
was the only thing he smashed.

320
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,060
﻿We will not tolerate any kind
of violence at the port.

321
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,180
﻿Azulay is talking about
filing a police complaint,

322
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,756
﻿he'll get a record and then he
wouldn't be able to work here at all.

323
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,980
﻿Would you like that better?
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

324
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,450
﻿Don't you see what's going on here?

325
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,520
﻿Azulay is playing games with you,
and you take him seriously?

326
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,220
﻿Who will replace Kravitz?
Have you thought about that?

327
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,660
﻿Do you know why I called you here?

328
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,130
﻿Let's just say
this isn't easy for me.

329
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,530
﻿Constructive criticism is always
a good thing. Shoot, Boss.

330
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,430
﻿You will be transferred
out of the department.

331
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,940
﻿Ben Bassat will give you
a new assignment.

332
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,300
﻿I've been working in this department
for 25 years.

333
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,670
﻿You also deprived me of the ability
to fight for you.

334
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,680
﻿Azulay is threatening to press charges.
- What for? What, over the pipe?

335
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,580
﻿Are you insane?
Are we in Switzerland here?

336
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,220
﻿People get violent
every day around here.

337
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,320
﻿Aaron, you told me off,
I heard it, and that's it.

338
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,790
﻿I still haven't given up.
Give me a couple of days

339
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,080
﻿and I'll do everything I can
to get you your job back.

340
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,990
﻿For now, I'm sorry, but that's
the decision. -The decision?

341
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,560
﻿Don't you see what's going on here?

342
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,160
﻿How you let them have their way
on my expense?

343
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:43,540
﻿Aaron, we both know
that if I leave this place,

344
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,940
﻿there will be 40 ships lined up
at the port entrance tomorrow,

345
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,340
﻿with now one to tug them in.

346
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,586
﻿I would like to remind you that
you are still a port employee.

347
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,510
﻿A port employee? I've figured
you out, you're his bitch, too,

348
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,680
﻿because of what he did
for your family.

349
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,280
﻿see you as a professional.

350
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,396
﻿But if you talk to me that way
one more time,

351
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,020
﻿I will fire you from the port completely
without a second thought.

352
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
﻿Get out of my office.

353
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,660
﻿I was wrong.

354
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,030
﻿I looked up to you.

355
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,830
﻿Even those who were here before you
stood up to him harder.

356
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,870
﻿You loser.

357
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
﻿I'll have the dumpling soup
and some bread, please.

358
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
﻿And for you?

359
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,800
﻿I'll have the Kiev patty, please.

360
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,870
﻿That comes with
a side of potatoes.

361
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,600
﻿That's fine. I like potatoes.
- Thank you.

362
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,880
﻿What was that all about?

363
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,050
﻿I spent a few years on a ship
with a Russian crew.

364
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,350
﻿So how many languages do you speak?

365
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,720
﻿Russian, Polish,

366
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,120
﻿Greek, Spanish,
a little Italian,

367
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,360
﻿and French and Moroccan from home.
How many are those?

368
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,360
﻿Seven languages.

369
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,230
﻿And Hebrew.
- And Hebrew.

370
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,130
﻿Say something nice in Russian.

371
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,170
﻿"I drink for the home
that was destroyed,

372
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,280
"to my cruel life..."

373
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,210
"To being lonely together..."

374
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,040
﻿"And I drink to you".
- "And I drink to you".

375
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,190
﻿Good.
- Thanks, Azulay.

376
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,120
﻿Put the money away,
put it away.

377
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,090
﻿We had a nice harvest
this month, huh?

378
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,160
﻿Alright, get back to work.

379
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,970
﻿Don't forget, take your time.
Work slowly. Don't rush it.

380
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,640
﻿You're thirsty, you want some water.
Fine, have a drink of water.

381
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,440
﻿If you start working fast,
they'll get used to it.

382
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,010
﻿Who will take care of us if we
don't look after ourselves, right?

383
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,590
﻿It's like you forget everything
we talk about at the meetings.

384
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,320
﻿Nice and slow, nice and slow.

385
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,520
﻿Good morning, Shlomi.

386
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
﻿I need a word with you.

387
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,670
﻿Good morning.

388
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,410
﻿When was the last time you took
a tugboat refreshment course?

389
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,040
﻿In January, I think.

390
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,350
﻿Have you got your papers?
- No.

391
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,440
﻿I'll tell you why I'm asking,

392
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,620
﻿because my records show it was on
January, only four years ago.

393
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,450
﻿Possibly.

394
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,760
﻿Well, there's a problem. You can go
aboard the tugboat like that.

395
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,936
﻿Go to the offices and sign up
for a refreshment course today.

396
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,460
﻿Get off it, Avitan. You know
they don't keep track of that.

397
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,706
﻿Lots of people didn't take
a refreshment course.

398
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,570
﻿A problem indeed. It's a good thing
you told me, I'll check on everyone.

399
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,500
﻿Are you joking here?
Is this some sort of seaman joke?

400
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,840
﻿I'm sorry. Normally,
you'd be going home over this.

401
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,910
﻿I don't understand, Aaron, why do you
want to send me home? -Shiomi!

402
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,650
﻿It's all good.

403
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,350
﻿We work by the book from now on.

404
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,620
﻿Sign up for the course,
do it properly.

405
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,790
﻿Go on.

406
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,200
﻿Why didn't you tell me?

407
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,700
﻿I tried, I really did.
See for yourself.

408
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,140
﻿I've been calling you all day.

409
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,310
﻿Sigal. Is your husband there?

410
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,720
﻿Hi, Shiomi, honey,
why didn't you tell me about this?

411
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,820
﻿Okay, forget it. Forget it!

412
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,120
﻿I don't care, go back to work tomorrow,
as if nothing's happened.

413
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,090
﻿Did you hear me?

414
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,330
﻿Go back to work tomorrow!

415
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,170
﻿And Shlomi did all of this
since yesterday?

416
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,840
﻿The last time I checked,
this is a week long course.

417
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,840
﻿Alright, Avitan,
what do you want from me?

418
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:51,080
﻿The coordinators asked me
to give this to you, and I have.

419
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,350
﻿This is unacceptable.
Shiomi, get off the tugboat.

420
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,720
﻿Aaron, I'm not getting off.

421
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,650
﻿Is there a problem
with the papers, Avitan?

422
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,590
﻿I will not eat your crap
for no reason.

423
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,230
﻿If I see you on a tugboat
one more time, I'll call the police.

424
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
﻿Let's go.

425
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,480
﻿I want you to let Shiomi
back on the tugboat.

426
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,820
﻿You want me to take Shiomi back,

427
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,090
﻿after you got rid of my best worker?
- He was getting in the way.

428
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,420
﻿You know,

429
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,790
﻿when your father dropped dead
right next to me, on the dock,

430
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,560
﻿without a penny in pension
to give you guys,

431
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,300
﻿I swore on his grave that no one would
be taken advantage of here again.

432
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,380
﻿That's fine, Azulay,

433
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,080
﻿but keep your hands
off of my department.

434
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,680
﻿You know what? Done deal,
but let Shiomi back on the tugboat.

435
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,320
﻿You don't get it.

436
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,180
﻿This is my decision, not yours.

437
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,320
﻿You're a little confused, Aaron,
but that's okay.

438
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,160
﻿Azulay, I think you are the one
who got confused.

439
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,000
﻿Take it off. -Harder.
- Harder, let it have it.

440
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,830
﻿What's going on here?
What are you doing?

441
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,116
﻿What's the matter with you?
- Did you put that up here?

442
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,516
﻿You're out of your minds, the order
came straight from management.

443
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,986
﻿Oh, management, is it?
- Yes, management.

444
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,416
﻿Take the clock off.
- Don't you dare touch that clock.

445
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,616
﻿Who are you to tell him
what to do?

446
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,210
﻿You can tell your wife's father,

447
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,350
﻿that if he's here to be a mole
for the management, we won't let him.

448
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,096
﻿This isn't right, guys.
Come on, get out of here, please.

449
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,666
﻿Who are you to tell me
to get out of here?

450
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,090
﻿So I'm calling security, right now.

451
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,110
﻿How are you?
- I'm fine.

452
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,816
﻿I want to understand
what exactly happened.

453
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,760
﻿I saw those idiots trying
to take the clock down.

454
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,380
﻿Who? -Haven't you done
enough damage? Huh?

455
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,220
﻿And my husband was stupid
enough to fight his people for you.

456
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,796
﻿Get out of this house.
- Tali, please calm down.

457
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,550
﻿I will not calm down,
get out of this house.

458
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,530
﻿Tali, please calm down.
- Get out of here, now!

459
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,090
﻿I'm here to see Ronen!
- Don't you yell at me! Get out!

460
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,000
﻿And don't come back, you hear?

461
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,640
﻿I want to know who did this,
so I can kick them out of the port.

462
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,410
﻿What don't you understand?
- Avitan, stop.

463
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,310
﻿Don't jump to conclusions.
- Conclusions?

464
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,750
﻿You forced a loser on me,
who hasn't been at sea for 30 years,

465
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,090
﻿made me get rid
of an excellent worker,

466
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,220
﻿and now you're turning
a blind eye on violence.

467
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,860
﻿They've gotten to my family,
Ben Bassat.

468
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,590
﻿We have already investigated,
no one touched him. Drop it.

469
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,360
﻿The kid slipped, it happens.

470
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,230
﻿Barak, what's up
with the cleaning crew?

471
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:01,030
﻿What are they using
to wash the docks?

472
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,600
﻿Workers can't be slipping
like ballerinas all over the place.

473
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,810
﻿Alright, I have to run.

474
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,910
﻿Avitan, keep up the good work.

475
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,440
﻿I've figured you out, Ben Bassat.

476
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,720
﻿Are you the security officer
of the port?

477
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:29,900
﻿It's nice to meet you.

478
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,070
﻿Are you part of the scheme, too?

479
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,140
﻿Look, I've been working here
for 15 years.

480
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,610
﻿My father punched his card
for 45 years, so you listen to me,

481
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,680
﻿Azulay is the port.

482
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,610
﻿There isn't a single employee
who wouldn't die for him.

483
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,850
﻿You are threatening me.
- God forbid.

484
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,620
﻿You can go after him,
but remember,

485
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,950
﻿when you pull the tree's roots,

486
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,690
﻿the whole trunk might
fall down on your head.

487
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,870
﻿I need to talk to you about
Aaron's son in law. Get in the car.

488
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,490
﻿Shut the door.

489
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,730
﻿Get out of the car.

490
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,570
﻿Internal Affairs officer

491
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,950
﻿Hello.
- Hello, Ronen.

492
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,290
﻿Look at the state of him.

493
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,990
﻿How are you feeling?
- Alright. Better.

494
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,900
﻿Look, Avitan,
you know I love you and all,

495
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,930
﻿but you're wasting your breath.

496
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,630
﻿Get off Azulay's back.
Listen to me, leave him alone.

497
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,340
﻿You know, this isn't like the sea.
At sea,

498
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,446
﻿if you get caught up in a storm if you
get caught up in a storm by yourself,

499
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,980
﻿you turn the wheel
and you're over it.

500
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,780
﻿Here, you have to work with people,

501
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,210
﻿you can't manage on your own
around here, do you get me?

502
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,626
﻿Good. There were a lot of people
like you around here before.

503
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,720
﻿They all came and went.

504
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,920
﻿Azulay always stayed.
- Right.

505
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,090
﻿Look, I have to go,
my daughter is waiting for me.

506
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,750
﻿Come on, let me
throw you in your boat.

507
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,806
﻿Didn't you say
she wasn't talking to you?

508
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,190
﻿What can I do?
She's angry with me.

509
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,746
﻿She's angry with you?
Let me have a word with her.

510
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,140
﻿Are you guys talking?
- Of course.

511
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
﻿2, 3...
- Pull!

512
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,590
﻿Haven't I told you
not to come around here anymore?

513
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,200
﻿Grandma is really late.
- What do you mean?

514
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,300
﻿We spoke this morning,
she said she talked to you.

515
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,870
﻿Are you out of your minds?

516
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,200
﻿Tali, give me a chance,
why are you fighting me?

517
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,710
﻿Okay, you can go, alright?

518
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
﻿Goodbye.

519
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,840
﻿Tali, come on.

520
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,496
﻿I've known you since we were babies,
from the neighborhood.

521
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,880
﻿Are you starting with me, too?

522
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,920
﻿This is your father. My friend.

523
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,190
﻿Can't you give him a chance?
Have you no heart?

524
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,330
﻿What will you do?
Who will look after the baby?

525
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,330
﻿I won't go to school today.
- Right.

526
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,960
﻿The baby's grandfather is here,
but you'll be missing school?

527
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,270
﻿Who helped you out when you gut drunk
when you were 14?

528
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,870
﻿18.

529
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,240
﻿Alright, fine. Come in.
Hurry up, before I change my mind.

530
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,740
﻿Wash your hands.

531
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,090
﻿Look, Sivan, look.
Look how pretty.

532
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,730
﻿Bro, I think...
- She's loaded.

533
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,370
﻿Do it.
- What?

534
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,200
﻿Change her.
- I don't know how.

535
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,170
﻿Who taught you to change a diaper?

536
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,940
﻿No one. How complicated can it be?

537
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,380
﻿Here...

538
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,280
﻿Easy. Easy.

539
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,640
﻿Stay out of it.

540
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,650
﻿Good job.

541
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,580
﻿Threatening people,
kicking them off the tugboats,

542
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,790
﻿threatening to go to the police,
jail time.

543
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,520
﻿You're a real inspector.

544
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,930
﻿Don't you think
you've crossed the line?

545
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,760
﻿You came into my home, Azul ay.

546
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,560
﻿That was my son in law
you kicked the shit out of.

547
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,760
﻿I raised you.

548
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,370
﻿You grew up on my lap,
you piece of shit.

549
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,170
﻿Don't you see we're family?

550
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,940
﻿My son in law is my family!

551
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,816
﻿That didn't stop your thugs
from kicking the shit out of him.

552
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,440
﻿You squeal over a few punches?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

553
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:22,380
﻿I told you more than once, Azulay,
I told you calmly and politely,

554
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,550
﻿get your dirty hands
off of my department.

555
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,290
﻿Your department?
Nothing is yours around here!

556
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,390
﻿We built this port, while you were
sailing around the world

557
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,560
﻿with your ships! No one tells me
what to do in this port,

558
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,930
﻿and you sure as hell won't!

559
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,830
﻿There was an unwritten rule
up until now,

560
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,530
﻿that management can't be touched,
but you broke the rules,

561
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,270
﻿and that rule will change,
as of now.

562
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,270
﻿I've lost control over my people.
None, you messed them up!

563
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,010
﻿Now sign on Shlomi's
return to the tugboats.

564
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,960
﻿I see you, Azulay.

565
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,960
﻿I see everything.

566
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,330
﻿And as for Shlomi,

567
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,200
﻿he will not return to the tugboats.

568
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,240
﻿I will kick you out of this port,

569
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,240
﻿you will not get
another job in Ashdod.

570
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,040
﻿And be careful when you
cross the street, too. Now, sign.

571
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,680
﻿Get out of here with your thugs,

572
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,050
﻿you are keeping me from my coffee.

573
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,070
﻿Whose bed is this?

574
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,740
﻿My daughter's.

575
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,240
﻿She's not here,
she's in the Ukraine.

576
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,710
﻿You have a daughter?

577
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,450
﻿Why haven't you told me about her?

578
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,950
﻿Because it's not something
I am very proud of.

579
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,636
﻿I had a really rough time
for a couple of years,

580
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,030
﻿until I got the job at the port.
I had to send her away, to my mother's.

581
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,390
﻿Until things work out.

582
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,150
﻿Only by the time things worked out,
it's already been ten years.

583
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,370
﻿Marina.

584
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,930
﻿She's little in this picture.

585
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,110
﻿She will be 14 this spring.

586
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,010
﻿She comes here on vacation
every summer.

587
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,560
﻿What's with you, bro?

588
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,590
﻿You tossed all our balls
into the water.

589
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,030
﻿I don't drink that shit anymore,
only milk and water.

590
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,570
﻿Really?
- Yeah, really.

591
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,216
﻿Maybe you can start eating again,
change your clothes once a month,

592
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,880
﻿maybe girls will start
noticing you again.

593
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,180
﻿Bro, you take too much to heart.
Forget the port. It's only a job.

594
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,050
﻿You left the sea for Tali, right?
Don't waste your time fighting with him.

595
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,520
Do you think I'm stupid?
I know exactly what's going on here.

596
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,871
﻿But this type of corruption,
that's so deep and organized,

597
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,906
﻿it's just unbelievable.
- Why are you saying that, bro?

598
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:30,330
﻿He's protecting us, I swear to you.
- Protecting us? -Yeah.

599
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,300
﻿He got rid of my best manager.
Got rid of him, as if he were garbage.

600
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,640
﻿What did I do about it?

601
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,400
﻿Nothing.

602
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,270
﻿Just forget about it.

603
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,780
﻿Kravitz, hold on.
I want to talk to you.

604
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,080
﻿What about?

605
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,920
I﻿'m on my way to see Ben Ami,

606
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,066
﻿either you get your job back,
or I'll leave my keys in his office.

607
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,150
﻿Why?

608
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,630
﻿My department isn't functioning.

609
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,720
﻿I've got four ships stuck at sea,
a dock full of cargo,

610
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,506
﻿I've been trying
to reach Berko on the phone,

611
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,736
﻿and he's been screening my calls
for two days now.

612
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
﻿Really? I knew you'd come here.

613
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,210
﻿We've got nothing to talk about,
Avitan. You and I are through.

614
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,870
﻿Give me five minutes, please.

615
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
﻿I was wrong.

616
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,600
﻿I want to help you.

617
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,040
﻿Avitan, you took sides.

618
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,940
﻿I'm taking sides right now.

619
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,380
﻿You will get your old job back
tomorrow morning.

620
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,350
﻿Kravitz?

621
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,320
﻿It's a painful subject.
He is a senior, devoted worker.

622
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,750
﻿I still don't understand why you
did that. -Why we did it? Okay.

623
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,390
﻿Anyway, Ben Ami,
I need a signed paper from you,

624
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,730
﻿today, reinstating Kravitz
in my department.

625
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:38,200
﻿No less, huh?

626
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,770
﻿Anything else, Avitan?
- As assistant manager,

627
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,270
﻿with Personnel privileges.

628
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,270
﻿I can have your ass out of here
over this, you know that?

629
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,440
﻿Save your breath.

630
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,710
﻿If Kravitz isn't back on my crew
today, I'm going home.

631
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,590
﻿Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

632
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,690
﻿You all know me already.

633
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,530
﻿I will not tolerate disobedience.

634
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,260
﻿Pinto. Come here, please.

635
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,740
﻿You sabotaged the punch clock
a while ago,

636
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,640
﻿and now, a security camera caught you

637
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,340
﻿punching time cards for people
who are currently at home.

638
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,680
﻿Well... -You are suspended from work
until further notice. -What?

639
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,680
﻿You know I think
very highly of you.

640
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,980
﻿You are the most
senior worker I've got,

641
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:34,740
﻿but you are setting
a criminal example.

642
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,210
﻿You are suspended,
and that is my final decision.

643
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:38,860
﻿Everyone back to work, please.

644
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,830
﻿Aaron, he's about to go on retirement.
- I was clear, get back to work!

645
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,220
﻿What am I doing here
in the middle of the night, Kravitz?

646
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,480
﻿Every Monday, a ship from Liverpool
pulls in the port.

647
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,790
﻿Around sunrise, I realized
that the cargo was being loaded

648
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,220
﻿from the ship straight
to Shlomi's tugboat.

649
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,530
﻿Shlomi parked the tugboat,
a forklift came along, took the cargo,

650
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:18,300
﻿and put it here, with the containers
that were already inspected. Cool, huh?

651
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,330
﻿Totally. But my question is...

652
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,040
﻿It seems that with a little help
from the guys over at Customs,

653
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,340
﻿and since the security guard
slacks off at night

654
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,040
﻿while inspecting the garbage trucks
that leave the port,

655
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,910
﻿that cargo leaves the port
in less than two minutes.

656
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,990
﻿15 minutes later, it's already being
unloaded at the importer's warehouse,

657
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,720
﻿and who do you think
is waiting for it there? Elfasi.

658
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,390
﻿And all of Ashdod is drinking
prime whiskey for half the price.

659
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,130
﻿Like the whiskey you were drinking
with your friend at the pub, in Lido.

660
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,140
﻿The question is
how to tie him to it.

661
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,510
﻿So what do you propose I do?

662
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,310
﻿That's your problem.

663
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,090
﻿I'm sorry, I hadn't had
I'm sorry, I didn't eat anything today.

664
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,920
﻿So, Avitan, what can we do
with this interesting information?

665
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,860
﻿Look, Ben Ami, I have no interest
in stirring things up here for nothing,

666
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,690
﻿but... -Excuse me.
Yardena, I need napkins.

667
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:24,300
﻿I'm listening.
- This terrorism his funding

668
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,650
﻿with the whiskey bottles
must be stopped, immediately.

669
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,770
﻿I want Mishali from the Customs
Investigation Unit here tomorrow.

670
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,510
﻿Avitan, you know as well as I do
that we've got nothing on them,

671
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,880
﻿no evidence. If you want Azulay
you'll have to bring in some facts.

672
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,780
﻿This isn't a vice squad.
- Isn't it?

673
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,156
﻿So I will personally make sure
that everyone will know

674
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,496
﻿what kind of port
you are running here.

675
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,820
﻿I'm done playing the role of the
stupid puppet from the sea, okay?

676
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,020
﻿Enjoy your meal.

677
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,030
﻿Yardena? -Yes? -Get me
Nachum Mishali from Customs. -Okay.

678
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:08,510
﻿A customs investigation was initiated.
You know what brought this on.

679
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,220
﻿So in light of the information
that I was presented with,

680
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,650
﻿I am forced to suspend you.

681
00:49:15,350 --> 00:49:16,380
﻿But don't worry, Azulay,

682
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,320
﻿I'm sure this has nothing to do with
you and that it'll go away quickly,

683
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,920
﻿and you'll be back with us and...

684
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,360
﻿You know very well
that we are all behind you.

685
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:27,660
﻿I understand you were cornered into this,
got you cornered,

686
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,030
﻿and that you have no choice

687
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,930
﻿and so I'm not angry.

688
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:33,000
﻿I just want to make one thing clear.

689
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,470
﻿Jacques Pinto will
return to work immediately.

690
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,800
﻿It's not that simple, Azulay.

691
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,770
﻿The order came
from a department head.

692
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,940
﻿I don't care if the Prime Minister
gave the order.

693
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,880
﻿If he's not back,
your port will burn.

694
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:55,750
﻿What is Shlomi doing here?

695
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,860
﻿This is his place of work,
this is how he makes a living.

696
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:01,730
﻿Elfasi.

697
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,760
﻿You have one minute
to get out of my way to the tugboat.

698
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,606
﻿No one goes on the tugboats today,
and they are not going anywhere.

699
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,550
﻿One minute, or you'll be
in deep trouble with me.

700
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,240
﻿What will you do?
Will you get rid of me?

701
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,970
﻿Get rid of everyone,
work by yourself.

702
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,950
﻿No boat will set sail.
- Keep your hands off. Calm down.

703
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:30,760
﻿Elfasi. Let me go on the tugboat
or you will all be in trouble.

704
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,700
﻿We agreed to keep it peaceful,
why are you making this harder?

705
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,470
﻿Why are you making this harder?

706
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,340
﻿Keep your hands off!
- Come here!

707
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,080
﻿Keep your hands off! -You will not
get rid of me, or my friend.

708
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,540
﻿Pinto, don't hit him!

709
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,680
﻿Pinto! Pinto!
- Enough! Let go of him!

710
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,650
﻿Don't hit him, Pinto!

711
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,320
﻿I'll fuck you up!

712
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,230
﻿I'll pass the information
to the police.

713
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,700
﻿You just file a complaint

714
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,940
﻿and we'll take care of everything
from then on. -No.

715
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:22,470
﻿He's only the symptom,
he's not the problem.

716
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,650
﻿And he's about to retire in a month.
You order his early retirement and...

717
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,150
﻿We put this thing behind us.

718
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:31,950
﻿Have you lost your mind?

719
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,250
﻿You still have bruises
from his beating.

720
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,690
﻿This man is a criminal.
- No.

721
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,120
﻿He's a good man.
That made a mistake.

722
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,300
﻿Thank you.

723
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,340
﻿Get well soon.

724
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,740
﻿What a wuss.

725
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,880
﻿This cowardly clerk fled away
as soon as you gave him a chance.

726
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,260
﻿Does it hurt?
- So bad.

727
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:28,730
﻿What's up, guys?

728
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,810
﻿Romano.

729
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,520
﻿Can you tell me why people
aren't loading sacks to the ship?

730
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,390
﻿The Union shut the docks down
until Azulay gets back.

731
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,020
﻿I tried working earlier,
but you know how it is,

732
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,166
﻿the Union guys are patrolling
the place and threaten anyone

733
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,460
﻿who even tries to lift a box.

734
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,736
﻿I need one more person,
we're setting sail.

735
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,830
﻿No one goes aboard.

736
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,300
﻿I want to make myself clear,

737
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:03,046
﻿the Marine Department workers are not
allowed to participate in the strike.

738
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:04,400
﻿You can't do that, Avitan.

739
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,370
﻿It's our right
to strike for a friend,

740
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:09,950
﻿even if he's from another department.

741
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,280
﻿Let's set sail, Kravitz.

742
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,580
﻿God damn them all to hell!

743
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,650
﻿Fuck you all.

744
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,520
﻿Let's go, I'm with you.

745
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:21,850
﻿Throw one in his face.

746
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,990
﻿Here, you asshole.

747
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,090
﻿So you're taking part in the strike
as well, huh?

748
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,710
﻿That man helped me.
He's always been there for me.

749
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,620
﻿You know what he's been doing
in the port, don't you?

750
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,080
﻿Can't you see no one
really cares about that?

751
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,380
﻿It's a game of Musical Chairs.

752
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,120
﻿Even Ben Ami. Today he's at the port,

753
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,310
﻿but tomorrow he might become
the CEO of a gas company.

754
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,366
﻿Azulay is the only one who truly cares.
- Who put this nonsense in your heads?

755
00:54:58,390 --> 00:54:59,420
﻿Listen to me.

756
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,860
﻿You must put an end to it
before more people get hurt.

757
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,730
﻿Before it really is too late.

758
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,140
﻿Come on, let's huddle up.

759
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,140
﻿These trucks will not go inside,
not a single one!

760
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,950
﻿Go over there!

761
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,020
﻿Come on! Azulay!
This is for you!

762
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,160
﻿"You can sit in your offices,
the port belongs to the workers!"

763
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,790
﻿Come on!

764
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:39,600
﻿"You can sit in your offices,
the port belongs to the workers!

765
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:42,970
﻿"You can sit in your offices..."
- "We will not leave the port,

766
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:49,340
﻿"don't waste your time!
We will not leave the port,

767
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,410
"don't waste your time!"

768
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,720
﻿What do we do with that mess
you've made here?

769
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,990
﻿We all know exactly
what has to be done.

770
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,496
﻿The strike has been going on
for a week now, Avitan.

771
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,866
﻿A ship is turned away
every day a ship is turned away

772
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:08,360
﻿and every one of those is a lawsuit.

773
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,630
﻿The European Union has declared us
as an At Risk Port,

774
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,030
﻿and the movers want my head.
What do we all know so well?

775
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,630
﻿The price. If you give in,
he'll crush you.

776
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,340
﻿I've seen it happen more than once
to those who were here before you.

777
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,910
﻿You have a lot of good people here,
who I learned to appreciate.

778
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,110
﻿Fight this strike, for their sake.

779
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,580
﻿You will have a brand new port
in a month's time.

780
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,010
﻿No terrorism and no schemes.

781
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,300
﻿The kind of port
we all would have liked to have.

782
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,420
﻿We want Azulay!

783
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,790
﻿Corrupted pigs! Corrupted pigs!

784
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,030
﻿They got freelancers
to replace us!

785
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,800
﻿You can't work here!

786
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,200
﻿Sons of bitches!

787
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,100
﻿You can't work here!

788
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,100
﻿Sons of bitches!
- Come on, guys! -Motherfucker!

789
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:58,480
﻿Motherfucker! You can't work here!
I'll kick your asses if you get off!

790
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:05,180
﻿Go home! Go home! Go home!

791
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,990
﻿Go home! Go home! Go home!

792
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,930
﻿Go home! Go home! Go home!

793
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,010
﻿We won't let anyone
take away our livelihood!

794
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,580
﻿We won't!

795
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:39,520
﻿Go home! Go home! Go home!

796
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,700
﻿Bread! Work! Bread! Work!

797
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:56,370
﻿I suggest to anyone who wants
to end this embarrassing strike,

798
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,900
﻿to cross the fence
and get back to work. I repeat,

799
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:05,240
﻿I suggest to anyone who wants
to end this embarrassing strike,

800
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,950
﻿to cross the fence
and get back to work.

801
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,980
﻿This is our port, not yours!

802
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,920
﻿No one goes in the port.

803
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,560
﻿This strike is illegal

804
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,300
﻿and I'll do everything in my power
to put a stop to it.

805
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,800
﻿We will not leave the port!
We will not leave the port!

806
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,610
﻿The biggest port in the country
will not be held hostage

807
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,640
﻿by unlawful workers,

808
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,380
﻿as senior and entitled
as they may be.

809
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,060
﻿We will not leave the port!
We will not leave the port!

810
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:03,130
﻿Keep you hands off!
- Sons of bitches!

811
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,040
﻿Why are you hitting us?

812
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,910
﻿Why are you hitting us?
- Sons of bitches!

813
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,430
﻿No, no!

814
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:31,630
﻿Stop! Don't!

815
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,570
﻿You son of a bitch!

816
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,540
﻿Let go of him, let go of him,
you're killing him!

817
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:48,980
﻿Let go of him!
- Let me take care of him!

818
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,220
﻿Where are you taking him?

819
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,990
﻿Listen to me, listen to me.

820
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,730
﻿You go to Azulay right now
and tell him to call this off,

821
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:03,290
﻿people are getting hurt. Go!

822
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:05,830
﻿Go, Shlomi!

823
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,760
﻿Azulay!

824
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,660
﻿They fucked us.

825
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,960
﻿They burned us to the ground.

826
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,140
﻿They called the police-
to the port, Azulay.

827
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,570
﻿They broke everyone.

828
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:11,530
﻿Hey.

829
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,130
﻿I'm so glad you came.

830
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,070
﻿This is amazing.

831
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,790
﻿What you've done here is amazing.

832
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,810
﻿Excuse me.

833
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:27,750
﻿Yes, Kravitz.

834
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,680
﻿Take your things and go home,
you no longer work at the port.

835
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,840
I﻿'m sorry.

836
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,570
﻿I'm sorry I had to call you, Avitan.

837
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,876
﻿What's up?
Can't you handle things on your own?

838
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,776
﻿I don't have the manpower.
I've got two tankers on the water,

839
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,910
﻿with no one to show them in.
- Isn't the strike over?

840
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,640
﻿They're at the Bris.
- What Bris?

841
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:30,940
﻿Azulay's grandson.

842
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,160
﻿Did you really think
the mess was all over?

843
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:35,890
﻿As if that's the first time
he's ever done this.

844
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,310
﻿Get some people together.

845
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,120
﻿see what I can do.

846
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,740
﻿I would like to thank you all
for dropping everything

847
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,410
﻿to celebrate our
fifth grandson's Bris with us.

848
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,420
﻿You are all part of my family,
and I love you guys.

849
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,650
﻿Mazal Tov!

850
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:17,820
﻿I am very pleased to see
my good friend, Aryeh Rosenberg,

851
01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:21,090
﻿from internal affairs. To you.
My good friend, Ben Bassat.

852
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,460
﻿When this baby grows up, what will
he know about what used to be here?

853
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:32,070
﻿Will he ever believe us if we
told him that was nothing here?

854
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,640
﻿Nothing but sand?

855
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,540
﻿Will he believe us if we told him,

856
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:43,310
﻿that back in 1957, not even a dog
would pass by my parents' trailer?

857
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,250
﻿Or that
of Jacques and Liz Pinto's,

858
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:52,320
﻿or Shlomi Chohen's parents'.
Shiomi, here's to you.

859
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,460
﻿We love you. -Or my good,
dear friends, rest his soul,

860
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,860
﻿Morris Avitan,

861
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,130
﻿and his wife Madeline,
may she live a long life.

862
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,710
﻿Ben Guryion said: "There will be
a port here". So he said.

863
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,310
﻿But it was your parents,
and you and I,

864
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,710
﻿that turned his words
and this sand into...

865
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,450
﻿Shabbat Shalom.
- Shabbat Shalom.

866
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,050
﻿Enjoy.

867
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,120
﻿Enjoy.

868
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,330
﻿You're not planning on opening
that bottle, are you, Mom?

869
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,510
﻿I would like for you
to remove it from the table.

870
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,730
﻿Excuse me?

871
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:33,130
﻿You heard me.

872
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:35,276
Don't step out of line.
This is my house.

873
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:37,776
﻿I am asking you to remove it from
the table. This is stolen property.

874
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,840
﻿Remove it from the table.

875
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,620
﻿This is a gift from a friend.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

876
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,750
﻿Grandma, I'm the first to admit that
Azulay has many rights around here,

877
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,980
﻿but this isn't right.

878
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,450
﻿Do you even know
what he's doing at the port?

879
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,050
﻿I know what he did
when your grandfather passed,

880
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,080
﻿and left me all alone
with two small children.

881
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,450
﻿Fine, but that doesn't make it
any less stolen.

882
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,350
﻿You should be ashamed of yourself.

883
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,720
﻿Azulay has poisoned your soul.

884
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,670
﻿Read her a bedtime story.
- What story?

885
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,080
﻿This is what we're reading now,
"Good Night, Porcupine".

886
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:24,480
﻿Alright? What else?

887
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,990
﻿Isn't that the teddy bear I
gave you for your fifth birthday?

888
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,260
﻿And change her before
she goes to sleep, alright?

889
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,990
﻿I put the nappies
in the bottom dresser drawer.

890
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:38,660
﻿I wasn't there
on that birthday, was I?

891
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,500
﻿No. You weren't.

892
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:47,400
﻿Well, I really am in a hurry.

893
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,740
﻿Is everything clear?

894
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:56,380
﻿Huh?
- Yes.

895
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,850
﻿If there's a serious problem,

896
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,020
﻿just put her in front of the TV
or something, okay?

897
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:08,260
﻿Honey. Sweetheart.

898
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,290
﻿I'm going now, okay?
You stay with Grandpa.

899
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:17,840
﻿What? Are you okay?

900
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,440
﻿What's with you?

901
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,480
﻿I came back here for you, you know?

902
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,990
﻿Why have you waited for so long?

903
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,700
﻿I'm here now.

904
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,980
﻿Just this once,
and with CEO's permission,

905
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,040
﻿Don't worry, Avitan,
I brought this whiskey from home.

906
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,650
﻿To the port.
- Cheers. -Cheers.

907
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:14,960
﻿I spoke with Mishali,

908
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,930
﻿he has agreed to close the case
with Elfasi, who ran the smuggling,

909
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,360
﻿getting fired, and he said
he'll get rid of the Customs guy.

910
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:22,900
﻿It's for the best, Avitan.

911
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,746
﻿The most important thing
is that we get back to our routine.

912
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:26,970
﻿You sent him a message.

913
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,470
﻿Azulay knows
we're on his ass now.

914
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,610
﻿I want him here,
I want him at the port,

915
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,790
﻿he is good for the port
and he's good for the people.

916
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:36,580
﻿Besides, he's a dead horse.

917
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,870
﻿You took away all of his power,
he can't touch you now.

918
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,920
﻿Don't you care at all
that we both put our necks on the line?

919
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,590
﻿Ben Ami, are you trying to tell me

920
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,090
﻿that you can really sleep at night
with that decision?

921
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:49,330
﻿You can't be a vegetarian
when running a port, Avitan.

922
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,320
﻿And thank you for your interest,
but I sleep just fine.

923
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,206
﻿I hope you won't regret this
when you wake up.

924
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:55,370
﻿Are you threatening me?

925
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:58,170
﻿Take it as you wish.
I'm just telling you,

926
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,340
﻿if you're planning on
getting Azulay back here,

927
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,610
﻿you'd better find yourself
a good lawyer right now.

928
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,260
﻿Come, have a seat.

929
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:32,600
﻿What's the matter with you?
Why are you fighting me?

930
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,210
﻿I've accepted the situation,
Ben Ami wants me back,

931
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,740
﻿so why are you objecting?

932
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,040
﻿This port is a place of business.

933
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,950
﻿People come here
to work and make a living,

934
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:47,880
﻿and you have corrupted it.

935
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,320
﻿You turned it into your own backyard.
You and your thugs

936
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:55,660
﻿have risked these people's
livelihood and their future.

937
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:58,310
﻿You will not return to the port.

938
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,440
﻿It's a real shame, Aaron,
because I really do like you.

939
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,410
﻿No one can take away
how you helped my family out,

940
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,180
﻿but that's it.

941
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:14,240
﻿Your story is over.

942
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,990
﻿That Customs guy that was suspended
was no more than a pawn.

943
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,860
﻿You know the one who really
took care of things for me.

944
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,860
﻿Nice long legs, blonde hair.
Sounds familiar?

945
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:36,300
﻿Here's the deal.

946
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,410
﻿If I go back to the port,
her secret goes with me to the grave.

947
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,250
﻿But if I don't, kid,

948
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,820
﻿her pretty face will be
all over tomorrow's papers.

949
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,960
﻿She wouldn't be able to get a job
working for a dog.

950
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,360
﻿I know I'll take the fall with her,
but I don't care.

951
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:02,850
﻿Where have you been?

952
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,090
﻿Where did you disappear to?

953
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,130
﻿Azulay told me everything.

954
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,570
﻿I was only trying
to make ends meet.

955
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,270
﻿That's life.

956
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,210
﻿There is no other way
to make do around here.

957
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,910
﻿You can't refuse, don't you see?

958
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,150
﻿What am I supposed to do now?

959
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,490
﻿Do whatever you like.

960
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,320
﻿Goodbye.

961
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:34,440
﻿Here's the guy
I was telling you about.

962
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:37,180
﻿Hello. -Aaron Avitan.
- Hello, hello.

963
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,050
﻿This is the man who helped us
clean up the port.

964
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,590
﻿That's no easy task.
Good on you, Aaron.

965
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,190
﻿Thank you, Ben Ami.

966
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:50,590
﻿What can I do for you?

967
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,360
﻿Aaron.

968
01:12:53,030 --> 01:12:55,930
﻿Your fight has allowed me
to finally begin the transition

969
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:59,400
﻿to the port's activities
as a privatized port.

970
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,540
﻿The proper way, the way ports
are run all over the world,

971
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:05,040
﻿no Unions, no thugs and goons,

972
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,510
﻿a financial enterprise,
that operates on profits.

973
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,956
﻿These are the representatives
of the business company

974
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,856
﻿which will purchase the bulk
of the port's shares.

975
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,360
﻿This is Ram Giladi, the CEO...
- Ben Ami, what's going on here?

976
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,120
﻿Azulay.

977
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:19,690
﻿The board has approved
the move yesterday.

978
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,430
﻿We won. Ben Bassat, please.

979
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,260
﻿Excuse me, Ben Bassat.

980
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,680
﻿Ben Ami, what's going on here?
- Avitan, listen to me.

981
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,630
﻿Thanks to the filth
you've helped me clean up,

982
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,540
﻿the government and the Union
gave me the go ahead.

983
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,246
﻿I've been waiting for this
for years now, and so have you.

984
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,480
﻿I did not clean up the port
just so you could take it

985
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,786
﻿and sell it to a bunch of people who,
with all due respect,

986
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:43,410
﻿only care about making money.
- You're not listening.

987
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:46,280
﻿I am offering you and Azulay the
opportunity to head a historic move.

988
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,920
﻿I need you both,
there's a ton of work to be done.

989
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,336
﻿You've seen the world,
you've seen your share of ports.

990
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,060
﻿You know how a real port
needs to operate.

991
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:56,100
﻿I know you would have wanted
things around here to be the same.

992
01:13:56,690 --> 01:13:58,600
﻿That is your dream, I know that.
- That's right.

993
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,400
﻿But for the employees,

994
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:02,830
﻿fortheir parents,
who built this port,

995
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:06,170
﻿not for some Giladi Group,
that will fill the tugboats

996
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:08,616
﻿with freelance workers by tomorrow,
who will work for pennies.

997
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,570
﻿Work for pennies?
What are you talking about?

998
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,780
﻿Zoom out,
don't think small, think big.

999
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:16,650
﻿Think about the future. Do you know
how people talk about our port?

1000
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,320
﻿Do you know what the entire country
thinks about us?

1001
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,850
﻿Think about the benefit this move
will bring to the economy.

1002
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:25,660
﻿Avitan. Privatization,

1003
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,590
﻿isn't all about you, the good guys,
against the bad guys out there.

1004
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,060
﻿It's a lot more
complicated than that.

1005
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,800
﻿Here, ask Azulay
what he thinks about the move.

1006
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,470
﻿If it's good for the port,
I'm on board.

1007
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,210
﻿See? There you go.

1008
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,310
﻿Even Azulay thinks
this is a good move.

1009
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:48,650
﻿I don't.

1010
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:51,850
﻿I did what I did for the people.

1011
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,150
﻿Not for these people.

1012
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,220
﻿I am not your man, Ben Ami.

1013
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,260
﻿That's a shame.

1014
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:01,890
﻿That's a shame.

1015
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:06,400
﻿Right.

1016
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:10,770
﻿Azulay. Avitan.
If you don't mind,

1017
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,540
﻿we will now move on
to the financial part of this meeting.

1018
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:19,680
﻿Stages of transition to a privately
owned and run operation.

1019
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,210
﻿The ideological part needs some more
work, that goes without saying.

1020
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:28,850
﻿I was wrong, Azulay.

1021
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:32,870
﻿But you will have to answer
to your people,

1022
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,410
﻿after you fire them all tomorrow.

1023
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,950
﻿Shlomi! Azulay! Azulay!

1024
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,070
﻿Azulay!
- Guys! Azulay is back!

1025
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,640
﻿Azulay is back at the port!

1026
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,880
﻿You don't have to stay on my account.

1027
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,390
﻿But I'm warning you,
Sivan's birthday is on April,

1028
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,170
﻿and I'll have your head
if you're not here.
