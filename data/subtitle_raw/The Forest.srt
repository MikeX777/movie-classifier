1
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:01,360
Masha ?! Why are you sitting here?

2
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:50,247
Son, pour tonight.
Have you talked?

3
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,882
- We talked ...
- Have you agreed?

4
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:56,128
Pour?

5
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:59,781
Why are you sitting, talking straight?
Got a portfolio?

6
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,759
What did you agree on?

7
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:09,492
There is nothing to agree on. They will be interrupted.

8
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:31,897
- Take shanezhki, maybe you want on the road?
- No, I don’t want to.

9
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:16,700
- Sit down, I'm for advice.
- I'll get there.

10
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:54,469
Did these come for me?

11
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:58,531
Pavel Vasilievich, you would first
say hello. You are not bursting with your wife in the hallway.

12
00:07:59,574 --> 00:08:00,535
Sit down.

13
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:11,003
Well, tell me. What's the news? Galina how?

14
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,028
Fine. What will happen to her?

15
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,162
But mine is something sick.

16
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,873
The doctor says it is necessary to
go to the regional hospital . There is no one to treat in the district.

17
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:21,592
I won't give them the sawmill.

18
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,903
And no one takes it away from you.

19
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,713
- Yes, to hand it over for scrap - they will give more.
- Well, you lived without a sawmill.

20
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:31,787
Year?

21
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,144
I understood you, Klavdiy Stepanovich!

22
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:42,139
Wait a minute! He got it! What did you understand? Sit down!

23
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:59,567
From the district, according to your soul, they
've already cut off my entire phone

24
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:02,843
The head himself drove for half an hour on the bald head,

25
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:05,810
I asked you to do everything more accommodating ...

26
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:12,390
These showed up, the envelopes are shoved.
I have never taken them and am not going to take them!

27
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:18,074
Back off, Pash. It will not end well.

28
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,513
Will you pay off the sawmill loan?

29
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,041
I
sold my mother's house where I grew up to raise money.

30
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:24,787
I pushed Sevrilov to the farm, into the shack!

31
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,920
Pash, well, I can't beat you off from them.

32
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:29,053
Do you think they have the
first competitor on the road?

33
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:34,409
And then what kind of competitor you are to them ...
they press you so that others do not divorce.

34
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:41,397
If you don't give the sawmill back, they
'll burn it to hell ... or even worse ...

35
00:09:41,702 --> 00:09:46,097
There - burned the man in
Odnoverovo, killed the dog to death,

36
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:50,335
and he and his wife were almost sent in pursuit.
Do you need it?

37
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:09,262
- Danilka, great!
- Hello!

38
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:15,104
For knowledge? Also true ...
You are ... send hello to it.

39
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,844
Timov! Come to us!

40
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:42,507
- Will you drag on?
- Not.

41
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,451
Why? Are you afraid your mother will smell it?

42
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:49,691
- Not.
- Don't be a horseman, take a pause!

43
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,999
Have you smoked?

44
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,671
So the bull is closer.

45
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:26,123
Great.

46
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,180
Let's go. Sit down.

47
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,977
Aunt Katya, let me help.

48
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:04,256
Don’t, Danil, I’ve almost done it.

49
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,764
- Have you brought some water?
- Yes.

50
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:42,069
- Have you learned your lessons?
- I will learn it, I will have time.

51
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:43,015
When?

52
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,460
- I'll check it in the evening.
- Check it out.

53
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,743
To which Suleima are you transferring the boards again?

54
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:51,869
I would go even to the people,
even to the Pashin guys.

55
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:56,294
- What is there on the sawmill - there are not enough boards?
- Yes, the boards are dofiga - not a pity ...

56
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,024
- To cut the bread?
- That's enough.

57
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,584
Maybe Claudius in some way will
persuade them to leave the sawmill?

58
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:40,566
Who will listen to him?

59
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,049
He's alone there in the afternoon.

60
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:46,966
Every week he
goes to the district administration to bow.

61
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:52,368
Now for gasoline, now for light ...
It does not interfere, and okay.

62
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,879
Pasha, we will.
Let's live somehow without a sawmill.

63
00:16:58,624 --> 00:17:00,224
And I don’t want to somehow.

64
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:02,006
Well, do people live?

65
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:05,023
They live.

66
00:17:11,028 --> 00:17:14,381
And if like on Verov? We don't have a dog.

67
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:15,600
Calm down, huh?

68
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:21,847
- Can I bargain with them? We have a boyfriend.
- No, maybe.

69
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:29,086
When the state farm was ruined, my father, like the
others, was on the sidelines. Somehow ...

70
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,515
Then he hid his eyes from me for the rest of his life.

71
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:34,944
Then times were different.

72
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:37,670
We all have the same time.

73
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,338
Give me the garlic.

74
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:03,982
Danka, catch her!

75
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,144
Thank you, Tribute! Without you I wouldn't catch.

76
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,189
Solving problem number 319.

77
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:37,143
We cut out a beam from a round log,

78
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:39,847
with a rectangular section of the
largest area.

79
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:45,109
Find the dimensions of the beam section
if the section radius is ...

80
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:31,908
Hello!

81
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,581
Hello. What do you want?

82
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:44,098
- Come home, still small!
- Yes, not for me!

83
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,279
Not ashamed to tell lies? Not for daddy.

84
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,520
So what?

85
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:27,253
What did you pin on?

86
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,006
AND?

87
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,130
Has your mother stopped sucking a boob for a long time?

88
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:36,207
Give me another one already? Young male!

89
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:49,282
Couldn't you take anything better?
There is a shop nearby.

90
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:17,936
Will you?

91
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,399
As you want...

92
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:37,816
- Go while sit in the barn.
- What?

93
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:40,026
What have we not seen here?

94
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:42,393
Showers additives.

95
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:46,181
I said fuck you out of here! Alive! Both!

96
00:23:47,035 --> 00:23:48,559
Come out I said!

97
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:51,712
- I'll take it?
- I'll take it for you!

98
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:57,550
Come on ... Don't be afraid - I won't drink everything ...

99
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:37,360
Why froze?
These devils won't sit there for long.

100
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:50,483
Well
let's go, take a ride, show us the surroundings?

101
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,188
Don't you know?

102
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:54,811
Well, as good as you - no.

103
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,850
Let's go, we have beer with us, barbecue ...

104
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:00,814
Let's relax on the river. Let's go?

105
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:19,436
Such a girl is good and so sad.
Well, how is that?

106
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:58,197
Sit down, I'll bring it.

107
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:00,886
Do not need.

108
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,545
Offended for the bath?
I'm sorry - I was stupid ...

109
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:06,944
Sit down - on the way after all.
Will you not be angry for ages?

110
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:32,545
Behind the swamp, the forest was broken by a hurricane.
Like matches.

111
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,449
A lot?

112
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:38,088
No, not really. Stripe.

113
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:47,806
Don't you like me at all?

114
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:54,152
The main thing is that you like your Pebbles.

115
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:57,256
And I'm not asking Pebbles, but you.

116
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,267
And I, Pash, have a husband.

117
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,342
Husband? I ate pears ...

118
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,690
How much is a husband ?!

119
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:10,064
Get off, I'll get there.

120
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,680
Maybe I want to marry you too.

121
00:27:15,321 --> 00:27:16,844
What is it like?

122
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,907
Yes, just like that.
I'll divorce Pebbles - I'll marry you.

123
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:23,298
You will give birth to me more children.

124
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:28,161
Have arrived already, groom.

125
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,100
I'm serious.

126
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,703
Why is it that you were drawn to love me?

127
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:41,462
Maybe I have been drawn to you all my life ...

128
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:44,319
It's time to make up your mind.

129
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:48,587
We will not succeed, Pash.

130
00:27:49,196 --> 00:27:52,092
Don't be in a hurry. Think about it.

131
00:27:58,087 --> 00:28:00,923
There is nothing to think about.
Drive home - Galina is waiting.

132
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,570
Fuh, Danka, scared ...
What are you? What did the mother send for?

133
00:29:02,594 --> 00:29:04,499
- Not.
- And what did you want?

134
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,403
Help.

135
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:07,767
To me?

136
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:10,747
Why aren't you at school?

137
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:13,594
The director let everyone go to help.

138
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:16,232
Every year they let us go like that - for potatoes.

139
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:23,935
Come on, assistant. Take the shovel.

140
00:29:35,204 --> 00:29:36,576
Do you want a drink, Tribute?

141
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:40,462
Go fetch some water from the kitchen, I'll drink too.

142
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,114
Where were you today?

143
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:11,140
I stayed at school.

144
00:31:11,282 --> 00:31:13,491
My father rattled with a shovel.

145
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,495
This is with sciatica!

146
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,018
The assistant has grown up.

147
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,846
Not ashamed?

148
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:24,280
Come for dinner in half an hour.

149
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,993
Will you be dressed to wash?

150
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,918
Raise your leg.

151
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:36,814
Another.

152
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,367
- Great!
- Great, Stepanych!

153
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:21,939
Hello!

154
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:27,359
- What - they cut everything off?
- All harvests, up to the central branch.

155
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:28,816
Have you come to mock?

156
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:32,389
Above what?! To mock ...

157
00:34:37,646 --> 00:34:39,322
Was this one like a tie?

158
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:44,970
Three months. And yesterday as luck would have it.
I slept through the guests, serpent ...

159
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:03,094
It smells more ...

160
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:04,999
Yours?

161
00:35:07,437 --> 00:35:09,038
There are no such in our store.

162
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:11,641
They don't have labels on them.

163
00:35:12,763 --> 00:35:14,989
My brother came in the winter and brought it.

164
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:20,314
Timofeich, bitch!
Maybe you helped him cut the wires?

165
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:22,219
Your brother has come!

166
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:23,948
Would she have survived with you since winter ?!

167
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:25,266
To fire ...

168
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,447
Who!

169
00:35:29,314 --> 00:35:35,033
Not ours. It looks like the area.
They have a large ZIL with a cabin. Blue.

170
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,159
Rooms?

171
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:40,059
So the night is dark, the mud is smeared ...

172
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:45,449
She feeds you ... She feeds you!

173
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,449
And you sold it for half a liter ...

174
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,007
Go away.

175
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:31,840
Attach in the shed.

176
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:36,175
If anyone sticks around - do not hesitate.

177
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:40,601
Pasha, do you understand that it was them?

178
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:44,563
Klavdiy Stepanych, I would have gone from here too.
Kindly.

179
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:46,942
Yes, I'll go ... Hey ...

180
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,590
Last week Agafonia the partisan
withdrew, so that there was no one left.

181
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:55,251
Those wires will be enough for you,
and I'll give you a tractor and a cart.

182
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:59,252
- So Muscovites come to her for the summer!
- Nothing, they will sit without light.

183
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:28,778
Get out of here while you're safe.

184
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:34,490
But the fact that?

185
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:36,977
Are you stupid or what?

186
00:38:23,471 --> 00:38:24,842
Take the buckets into the house.

187
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:56,970
The old man wants to transport the grandmother to us.

188
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,407
The bear house will be free for us.

189
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:01,679
I will repair it - we will live there.

190
00:39:02,684 --> 00:39:03,750
Is it so straightforward to live?

191
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:06,378
Well yes. Like husband and wife.

192
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,473
Have you found yourself an oldish wife?

193
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:11,975
Not. You are young and beautiful.

194
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:19,904
I will be a good husband.
I will not drink. I'll go to work.

195
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:22,334
Dad will take it to the sawmill anyway.

196
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:27,787
- When are you going to teach?
- I'll find the time.

197
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:32,352
You're getting something early today from school.
Don't you skip?

198
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:33,792
Not.

199
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,881
I'm late for the farm because of you.

200
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,853
- How many lessons were there?
- Six.

201
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,368
- No twos?
- Not.

202
00:40:10,725 --> 00:40:12,097
Why haven't you been there for so long?

203
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,883
- Where do you disappear after school?
- I'm not lost.

204
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:18,306
I was in training.

205
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:20,325
You yourself wanted me not to sit at home.

206
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:21,483
What training session?

207
00:40:21,925 --> 00:40:24,323
I signed up for volleyball, the physical education teacher leads.

208
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,808
We are preparing for regional competitions.

209
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:35,244
So. Soup on the table. Learn the lessons.

210
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:54,763
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait ...

211
00:41:17,783 --> 00:41:20,126
They are animals, they are cleverer than people.

212
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,396
- Who are you talking about?
- Yes, my Danka, has changed completely.

213
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:25,603
Doesn't want to study.

214
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:29,193
Previously, you could not drive out of the house,
but now it disappears, do not understand where.

215
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:34,181
If she didn't know how timid he is before girls,

216
00:41:34,876 --> 00:41:37,239
I would have thought that I would have started some curl.

217
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:38,931
Will lead more.

218
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:41,765
Yesterday's milk was poured out to the calves again?

219
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:44,645
The creamery again
takes it for a pittance , so where is it?

220
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:48,123
Finish your studies, and then start.

221
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,035
What will hang,
so surely it will not be up to study.

222
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:57,385
Now they still study at school,
and they themselves jump into bed with the peasants.

223
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:00,280
Yes, and in our time there were enough whores.

224
00:42:03,327 --> 00:42:07,061
The whole herd would have been killed at once.
Neither we nor the cattle would be tortured.

225
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,647
It's more profitable to drain the whole thing.

226
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:55,481
Well, let me help you to the
hut, Mikola, to get there.

227
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,804
Hi Gal.
Sorry, I was delayed.

228
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:29,681
I scratched the smut, otherwise my drunk
will come and get sick, God forbid.

229
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:32,833
Wait, you grunt!

230
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:49,379
Why did you tell your mother about us?

231
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,645
I did not say.

232
00:47:52,508 --> 00:47:53,954
How does she know?

233
00:47:55,045 --> 00:47:56,598
Maybe you saw us?

234
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,050
And if anyone else has seen?

235
00:48:03,077 --> 00:48:04,601
Nobody else walks here ...

236
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,344
And let her see.

237
00:48:09,706 --> 00:48:11,610
To entice us to meet, Tribute.

238
00:48:12,982 --> 00:48:16,944
Why? I don't skip school anymore.

239
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:21,242
We must beckon. For a while.

240
00:48:22,658 --> 00:48:24,030
What did she tell you?

241
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,773
Do not listen to her, she is not a decree to us!

242
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:31,673
Is it because of Kolka? He won't know anything.

243
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:35,407
And even if he finds out, I will not give you an offense!

244
00:48:40,473 --> 00:48:41,957
Give me a hug.

245
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:02,766
Where is the student?

246
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,722
“I don’t see it during the day.”
- He plays volleyball.

247
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:09,388
Volleyball? At school chtol?

248
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,902
At school.

249
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:15,864
Katka Popova's in the bathhouse.

250
00:49:18,227 --> 00:49:20,741
- What - do not understand?
- Got it.

251
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:24,779
Well, if you understand so, talk to him.

252
00:49:27,522 --> 00:49:28,894
You are the father.

253
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:32,703
He should finish school.
Maybe he will go to school too.

254
00:49:33,313 --> 00:49:36,132
And he got in touch with a woman
who suits him as a mother.

255
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:39,256
What will come of this? Why are you silent?

256
00:49:39,636 --> 00:49:40,932
Why don’t you talk then?

257
00:49:42,075 --> 00:49:45,275
This age has come,
he still needs a woman.

258
00:49:45,503 --> 00:49:47,560
Better with Katka.

259
00:49:49,923 --> 00:49:52,132
Why are you banging something wrong?

260
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:57,187
Why are you hunting? To
bring him with some young schoolgirl in the hem?

261
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:00,082
Come on, motherfucker, understand!

262
00:50:01,987 --> 00:50:05,568
And people will find out. What a shame!

263
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:12,511
Pasta on the stove, if you like.

264
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:14,767
I have to run to the evening milking.

265
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:16,940
Aren't she ashamed?

266
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,750
With her husband! We do not achieve the mind ...

267
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:27,442
And Kolka finds out - he will knock ours down.

268
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:32,692
He is sober and bad,
and drunk is wilder than the wild.

269
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:39,676
That's it, gone.

270
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:10,451
What did you want, Pash?

271
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:13,835
He's a child yet, he doesn't understand.

272
00:51:14,294 --> 00:51:15,893
You twist the kid's life.

273
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:17,646
He, Pash, understands more than you and me.

274
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,440
Leave him, I say!

275
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:22,564
Can we have love?

276
00:51:22,945 --> 00:51:25,536
Who?! The very thing is not funny?

277
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:32,088
Something I don't understand, Pash, who are you
grieving about? About the boy or about yourself?

278
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:57,841
Well, why are you if not a man?

279
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:02,413
So that on Saturday at the disco
was, we have a mahach with the district,

280
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:04,547
if you don’t come - uroyu, okay?

281
00:52:05,537 --> 00:52:06,867
I got it ?!

282
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:10,082
I can not hear!

283
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,746
Come on over. You will dance, you will smell the woman.

284
00:53:38,491 --> 00:53:39,947
Let's go for a walk.

285
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,374
Don't come to me for now, that's all. That's better.

286
00:53:52,398 --> 00:53:56,260
What's better? Let's go to the
bear, grandma will let us in.

287
00:53:56,284 --> 00:54:00,375
I have some money. In the summer I
will go to logging, there I will earn.

288
00:54:00,399 --> 00:54:02,813
- All, Tribute, I'm on the farm, let me go.
- Why?

289
00:54:02,837 --> 00:54:04,641
Yes, you will
have so many girls besides me .

290
00:54:04,665 --> 00:54:06,307
I'm good for you as a mother, not as a girl.

291
00:54:06,341 --> 00:54:09,008
- I do not need them!
“You don’t understand, right?

292
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,834
I will say it in a simple way.

293
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,119
I'm tired of you.

294
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:16,146
Played.

295
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:18,768
I'm not interested in you
more, even disgusting.

296
00:54:19,514 --> 00:54:23,553
And it's disgusting to see you,
and disgusting to touch. To the nausea.

297
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:26,159
Clarified?

298
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:32,039
And do not try to come to me tomorrow
, and this morning

299
00:54:32,063 --> 00:54:34,334
also. I have a legal husband
, I live with him.

300
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:37,588
I don't need a second one. Let me go!

301
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,233
I will ...

302
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:47,695
Come on!

303
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,541
Thank God I sat down ... I barely managed ...

304
00:57:49,046 --> 00:57:50,798
Where is he?

305
00:57:51,712 --> 00:57:53,237
This one I suppose?

306
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:56,361
Will come, will not go anywhere.

307
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:04,970
At least I came to supper and thanks for that!

308
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:10,913
Sit down until the potatoes are cold.

309
00:58:16,475 --> 00:58:19,295
How is it! Have you fed?

310
00:58:20,894 --> 00:58:22,419
Mamma's delicious cooking uzho?

311
00:58:24,399 --> 00:58:26,532
Soon you won't come home to spend the night!

312
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,257
So what now?

313
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:38,541
Waited 16 years ...
All my life the guy blocked.

314
00:59:02,846 --> 00:59:04,294
Trouble, Vasilich!

315
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,381
I was just conscious
, moaning, cursing.

316
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:22,275
Him to a first-aid post or an ambulance from the area?

317
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:26,162
What first-aid post ?!
There is nothing besides bandages and gandons.

318
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:27,990
I'll take it to the area myself - it will come out faster.

319
00:59:28,014 --> 00:59:33,172
Come on, come on! Come on!

320
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:39,639
Yes, they crept up behind, did not see.

321
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:12,292
Where were you on Saturday? Jerk off ?!

322
01:00:17,206 --> 01:00:19,024
Why are you cringing like a woman?

323
01:00:19,424 --> 01:00:21,481
AND?! Are you a fagot ?!

324
01:00:22,014 --> 01:00:23,843
That's why you don't fuck anyone!

325
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:28,709
Every day you will receive like a fagot!
Until you fuck anyone!

326
01:02:39,698 --> 01:02:41,009
What do you need?

327
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:42,854
What are you doing? Quiet.

328
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:44,759
Sveta is your name?

329
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:47,544
Shall we ride?

330
01:03:03,766 --> 01:03:06,432
Yurka, thank God,
got off with one concussion.

331
01:03:07,446 --> 01:03:08,816
They will be discharged in a week.

332
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:12,219
It would be good. Talk to Danila.

333
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:16,246
Yurka needs to be replaced
while he is on sick leave.

334
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:22,508
There is not a single drinker,
even if you take Timofeevich back.

335
01:03:22,806 --> 01:03:24,634
Like they say it was encoded again.

336
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:31,151
The guy will quit school because of her.
Where then? Only in the army.

337
01:03:31,447 --> 01:03:36,323
I went to the cops, an attempt, I say,
with the infliction of grievous bodily harm.

338
01:03:36,863 --> 01:03:38,159
And they already know.

339
01:03:39,004 --> 01:03:41,524
There would be no sawmill, they say,
there would be no damage.

340
01:03:41,892 --> 01:03:45,767
What will he become without education?
Drinks like everyone else!

341
01:03:46,936 --> 01:03:48,231
Sawmill to him ...

342
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:51,257
Fig them, not the sawmill!

343
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:58,571
I'm going to go crazy because of him ... Pasha!

344
01:04:36,184 --> 01:04:37,652
Who is there, the owners?

345
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:41,854
There is.

346
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,974
Marry me!

347
01:07:46,683 --> 01:07:47,749
Go away.

348
01:07:50,873 --> 01:07:53,235
Get out there, you moron! What did you hatch for ?!

349
01:07:53,692 --> 01:07:57,121
You still have to
suck your mother's tit , not marry!

350
01:08:01,463 --> 01:08:03,521
Get lost, you moron!

351
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:39,951
Mother come out. We need to talk.

352
01:08:41,746 --> 01:08:42,813
Didn't hear ?!

353
01:09:08,316 --> 01:09:11,516
What are you? Are you going to cut your daddy ?!

354
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:12,896
I will.

355
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:25,239
Pasha! Pasha!

356
01:09:25,263 --> 01:09:27,525
Why are you doing something! Stop it!

357
01:09:39,936 --> 01:09:41,384
Vasilevich!

358
01:11:01,515 --> 01:11:03,815
Hello guys. Sit down.

359
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:09,866
- Does anyone know where Sveta is?
“They took her to the hospital.

360
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:12,990
- What happened?
- She was raped by the district.

361
01:11:13,014 --> 01:11:14,994
What? All the same, everyone will find out.

362
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,631
Danila!

363
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:34,411
What are you worth? Take off your clothes.

364
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,831
How did it make you so happy?

365
01:13:48,321 --> 01:13:50,072
You will warm up now, now.

366
01:15:33,781 --> 01:15:38,201
Oh, you fucking subcloud! In my bed!

367
01:16:34,397 --> 01:16:35,463
Go home!

368
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:39,707
Don't say anything to anyone, do you hear?

369
01:16:40,035 --> 01:16:41,330
Do not say anything!

370
01:16:42,884 --> 01:16:44,509
Take your clothes in the hut!

371
01:16:45,048 --> 01:16:46,877
Go home. Go.

372
01:20:33,104 --> 01:20:34,476
They will carry it away anyway.

373
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:40,190
Kolka departed.
Katya is shining a dozen. What - no?

374
01:21:01,196 --> 01:21:02,263
Have you forgotten what?

375
01:21:05,714 --> 01:21:06,780
I killed Kolka.

376
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,952
I scissor him in the back.

377
01:21:15,467 --> 01:21:18,057
Fear God!
Danila, why are you saying that?

378
01:21:18,842 --> 01:21:20,670
He wanted to strangle her, I killed him.

379
01:21:25,569 --> 01:21:26,788
Well, shut up.

380
01:21:27,734 --> 01:21:29,105
Shut up, do you hear!

381
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,619
Don't tell anyone that.

382
01:21:33,144 --> 01:21:35,201
Everyone knows that Kolka Fraerlich
made a decision about the bottle.

383
01:21:36,372 --> 01:21:39,116
What do you want
to go to jail because of that beast?

384
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:43,901
Outside and okay! Nobody even felt sorry for him.

385
01:21:44,137 --> 01:21:47,642
- It is not her fault! I need to be arrested!
- Who is to blame ?! Who is guilty?!

386
01:21:48,815 --> 01:21:50,111
She's to blame.

387
01:21:51,909 --> 01:21:53,686
The husband will never strangle his wife.

388
01:21:57,050 --> 01:22:00,174
I sinned and almost dragged you with me.

389
01:22:02,536 --> 01:22:04,365
Have pity on me at least.

390
01:22:06,422 --> 01:22:08,403
Don't tell anyone!

391
01:22:09,698 --> 01:22:10,993
Okay?

392
01:22:12,365 --> 01:22:14,117
Well, promise your mother!

393
01:22:18,384 --> 01:22:19,451
Where are you going?

394
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,331
To school. I'll have time for the second lesson.

395
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,308
Hello! I'm sorry, but where is Danila?

396
01:23:11,765 --> 01:23:15,040
At a big break, he got on a
day bus to the district.

397
01:23:16,252 --> 01:23:17,470
Thank.

398
01:24:42,692 --> 01:24:45,574
Boy, buy shoes - Lipetsk factory!

399
01:25:22,406 --> 01:25:26,520
Look, it's worth noticing early,
when the humps just caught fire.

400
01:25:26,962 --> 01:25:29,547
And they sensed
that the sawmill began to be seized by fire.

401
01:25:31,245 --> 01:25:32,902
Why am I soaring now to you ...

402
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:40,464
Vasilich, I didn't tell you just now ...

403
01:25:41,372 --> 01:25:43,125
You already grab the knives ...

404
01:25:43,923 --> 01:25:49,155
Before it puffed, I saw how Danka
got out of your run, hiding behind that mowing.

405
01:25:51,306 --> 01:25:54,327
I didn't say it right away. I thought you’ll suddenly hurt the kid.

406
01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:16,646
Great!

407
01:26:22,194 --> 01:26:23,717
Great.

408
01:26:35,908 --> 01:26:37,661
So what? How is he?

409
01:26:38,703 --> 01:26:39,923
What would happen to you?

410
01:26:40,838 --> 01:26:44,190
By the way, I didn’t sleep for two days either.
Two murders, fire.

411
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:50,507
But here on the collective farm they mainly sowed livestock.

412
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,455
What else will happen now?

413
01:26:53,479 --> 01:26:56,732
Yes, what will be, it will overgrow, the forest will be.
Breadwinner.

414
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,110
Danya .....

415
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:18,500
Let's go ... Well let's go!

416
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:43,906
I killed Kolka Popov.

417
01:27:47,082 --> 01:27:48,128
Who are you to?

418
01:27:50,378 --> 01:27:52,108
I killed Kolka Popov.

419
01:27:52,484 --> 01:27:54,386
What is Kolka Popov? Who are you?

420
01:27:54,717 --> 01:27:56,164
His neighbor is from Ozernoye.

421
01:28:01,826 --> 01:28:06,321
Sanya, here is
some kid from Ozernoye on your case ...

422
01:28:07,922 --> 01:28:09,674
Came to give up.

423
01:29:09,692 --> 01:29:13,882
Hit ... with a
clenched sheep shear.

424
01:29:14,842 --> 01:29:19,490
He choked her on the floor,
as if I hit him from above. Right here.

425
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,861
He immediately fell on his face.
The scissors stayed in it.

426
01:29:26,378 --> 01:29:28,130
It is not her fault. It's me.

427
01:29:31,864 --> 01:29:33,388
Listen to me, Robin Hood ...

428
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:36,207
- She protects me!
- And I do not care who protects whom!

429
01:29:36,231 --> 01:29:38,001
The suspect
killed her husband in cold blood ...

430
01:29:38,025 --> 01:29:39,244
He's a killer himself!

431
01:29:39,268 --> 01:29:41,415
- Yes, we know without you!
- It's not fair! I killed him!

432
01:29:41,569 --> 01:29:43,017
She didn't touch him! I scissor him ...

433
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:44,199
Shut your mouth!

434
01:29:44,532 --> 01:29:45,753
And listen to me carefully!

435
01:29:46,369 --> 01:29:48,533
If you want to go on a
youngster - I'll give it to you quickly

436
01:29:48,557 --> 01:29:50,506
will arrange. She is a grown
woman, unlike you.

437
01:29:50,712 --> 01:29:52,693
And he gives a report that he says what he is doing.

438
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:54,941
You are given a chance, you have your whole life ahead of you

439
01:29:55,329 --> 01:29:57,082
so I grabbed my legs in my hands,

440
01:29:57,569 --> 01:29:58,560
and left here!

441
01:29:59,284 --> 01:30:00,312
Run!

442
01:30:04,883 --> 01:30:06,178
Until I change my mind.

443
01:30:07,894 --> 01:30:09,570
I want to see her.

444
01:30:11,093 --> 01:30:12,084
Came out!

445
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:21,837
Ivanych, let the kid out.

446
01:31:13,036 --> 01:31:16,008
Hello. Can you tell
me where Svetlana Lukashina lies?

447
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:18,674
- Are you a relative of her?
- Classmate.

448
01:31:39,551 --> 01:31:41,456
Nuuu ... Am I going?

449
01:31:43,055 --> 01:31:44,351
Why did you come?

450
01:31:46,789 --> 01:31:47,780
Just...

451
01:31:51,666 --> 01:31:52,961
Do you love me?

452
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,763
Not.

453
01:33:01,402 --> 01:33:02,882
What are you doing that ?!
