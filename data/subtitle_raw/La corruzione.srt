1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:10,235
"Even if God didn't exist, Religion
would still be Saintly and Divine."

2
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:17,128
Now you, in leaving this school...

3
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:20,646
... will find yourselves facing,
just as you may have studied...

4
00:00:21,068 --> 00:00:23,638
... two conceptions of reality:

5
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,245
... that of the Catholic,
and that of the Marxist.

6
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,761
It's useless to think otherwise...

7
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:35,684
... the reality in Europe is just that,
divided into two parts.

8
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:39,307
I don't want to tell you:
"You must choose", because you...

9
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:42,747
... being of the bourgeois,
have already chosen.

10
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:46,160
I will however add something
that I'd like you to keep private.

11
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:49,227
Whatever your position
in life may be...

12
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:52,925
... first and foremost it should
be one of moral responsibility.

13
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,723
What does that mean?
It means...

14
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:02,444
... that the story of men,
that which has brought man...

15
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:05,528
... to this point,
has always been founded...

16
00:01:06,188 --> 00:01:09,964
... on moral choice,
on the heart's impulse.

17
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:12,907
Therefore, the real reason...

18
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,968
... the cold rationalism,
algebra, mathematics...

19
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:20,443
... isn't the story.
Because the story of mankind...

20
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:24,027
... is an aspiration
conscious of what is good.

21
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:27,167
An act of love that embraces humanity.

22
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:30,881
This is the true education.

23
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,803
This is civilization.

24
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,596
This is the blowing of
the high winds of culture.

25
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:45,963
This...

26
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,357
... is liberty.

27
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:21,495
CORRUPTION

28
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:42,707
Oh, young master...
Come, come!

29
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,467
After so many years...

30
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:47,528
You were so little when you came here.
Allow me...

31
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:52,187
Are you in a bad mood, Stefano?

32
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:54,187
We're going back to life!
To women!

33
00:04:54,188 --> 00:04:56,187
Enough of this "Alma Mater", we're free!

34
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:58,107
Don't speak Latin, I'm sick of it!

35
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:00,041
Congratulations, Stefano! Bye!

36
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:02,083
We made it!

37
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:11,684
Bye, Claudio!
Keep in touch!

38
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:16,520
- Hi. So, you're leaving?
- Soon.

39
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:20,241
- I came to say goodbye.
- Yes, good...

40
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,048
- Where will you go?
- To my father's house, for now.

41
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:29,439
- So, you've made your mind up?
- I think so.

42
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:33,726
I've been meaning to give
you this book for a while.

43
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:37,827
The editor is one of
your father's competitors.

44
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:41,479
- Something to remember him by.
- I want you to read it.

45
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,227
You think this book will do
what you never managed to?

46
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:47,446
That isn't what I meant.

47
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:51,484
See, I have absolutely nothing
against your improbable career choice.

48
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,959
Why? Don't you believe in it?

49
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:57,881
It's not that I don't believe in it.

50
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:02,804
It's that... look, let's
speak frankly for a moment.

51
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:06,208
You're leaving, and we'll probably
never see each other again.

52
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,887
To me it seems as though your chosen
vocation is founded on a...

53
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:15,727
... true religiousness, Catholic.
Yet yours is a vague aspiration...

54
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,598
... full of good faith, of purity...

55
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:22,520
... but vague, imprecise.
To be a priest...

56
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:25,187
Being a priest is, above all,
a discipline.

57
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:26,723
I know that.

58
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,601
But I can't do anything else.

59
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:36,440
And then, if it's something that
moves me, that gives me strength...

60
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:42,847
... if, well, if the thought of a pure
and religious life makes me happy...

61
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:45,246
... why should I have to renounce it?

62
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:49,920
And what about your father?
Have you told your father?

63
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:52,361
No, but I'll tell him.

64
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:56,481
It won't be easy.
Goodbye, Stefano.

65
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:02,827
I hope that your decision
turns out to be just and true...

66
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:05,284
... and that I, all things
considered, was wrong.

67
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:09,082
- You would prefer to be wrong?
- Yes...

68
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:12,147
But, unfortunately I'm
almost always right.

69
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,867
Goodbye, Stefano.

70
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,324
- Goodbye, and thank you!
- Good luck!

71
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:55,004
Come, I'll show you your room.

72
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,757
Through here.

73
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,477
Here you are.

74
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:08,157
Come.

75
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:59,479
If this is what you decide,
we'll be waiting for you.

76
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:05,403
Stefano!

77
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:07,587
"Alitalia, second call..."

78
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,787
"... departure flight number 14222."

79
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,747
- Father!
- Hey there! Hi.

80
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:13,787
Hello, Judy!

81
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:15,926
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, Father.

82
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:20,918
- Where are we going now?
- To the office.

83
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,041
I have things to attend to.

84
00:09:23,148 --> 00:09:25,479
But after that we have
the entire day together.

85
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:29,678
I wanted to go and find Mother.

86
00:09:30,428 --> 00:09:31,997
Do you know how she is?

87
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,427
No, I don't know. And you know very
well that I've never been fond of...

88
00:09:35,428 --> 00:09:37,998
... your mother's imaginary illnesses.

89
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:43,842
Perhaps they're not so imaginary. Otherwise
they wouldn't have taken her at the clinic...

90
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:49,507
Sick people like your mother are
a gift from heaven for those clinics.

91
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,487
50,000 lire a day...

92
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,957
But anyway, if you like,
we can go and see her.

93
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:00,477
Will you come as well?

94
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,886
I'll wait for you downstairs.

95
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,643
Stefano!

96
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:30,962
Mother!

97
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,317
How are you?

98
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:39,523
I just woke up, but you know...

99
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:42,520
... I could have sleep for longer.

100
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:46,719
How long will the treatment last?

101
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:51,639
I don't know.
Ten, eleven days.

102
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,239
Fifteen days, Mrs. Mattioli.

103
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:57,004
Just think, Stefano,
another fifteen days.

104
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,483
I'll sleep fifteen days
without even realizing.

105
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:07,603
- When did you get back?
- I've finished at school.

106
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,283
Did you pass?

107
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:13,124
Yes, I wrote...

108
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:15,720
Didn't you receive my letter?

109
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:21,405
Um... I don't know... maybe.

110
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:28,007
But, you know, this treatment is
a must. I've spent my days...

111
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,127
Didn't your father tell you?
I want to know...

112
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:35,867
... what he told you. He finds my
exhaustion funny, doesn't he?

113
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:37,907
No, that's not true.
He was worried about you.

114
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:41,400
Here you are, today I've made you
a heavier meal than usual.

115
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,844
If I could only eat this way outside...

116
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:49,307
... without the bother of chewing,
of swallowing, of...

117
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,587
You would soon tire of it, Ma'am.

118
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,158
No, my dear, you're mistaken!

119
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,163
The diet...

120
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,827
... cleanses the skin.

121
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:00,947
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, that's right!

122
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:03,359
Hand me the mirror.
Go and open the window.

123
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:07,001
See, it's the second time that I've...

124
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,267
... this sleep treatment...

125
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:12,838
... stretches....

126
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:14,587
No!

127
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,043
Close it!

128
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:26,557
I was saying that...

129
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:30,241
... it's the second time I've
done this sleep treatment...

130
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,888
... it stretches me out,
rejuvenates me.

131
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,203
Isn't that right?

132
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:42,803
And you know, you don't dream anything,
good dreams or bad dreams.

133
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:47,646
Come here, sit down.

134
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,907
The doctor will be here soon
and you haven't told me anything.

135
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,107
That's true, Mother, we never
see each other anymore.

136
00:12:57,108 --> 00:13:00,361
I know, but you grow up too fast...

137
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,399
... and I get old too fast!

138
00:13:03,988 --> 00:13:06,387
I have no way to defend myself!

139
00:13:06,388 --> 00:13:08,640
- From what?
- From insomnia!

140
00:13:09,668 --> 00:13:12,443
You're young, you don't understand!
See...

141
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:17,759
... insomnia at my age
is a terrible thing!

142
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:24,042
Alone! Alone at night with all
my thoughts, here, here, here!

143
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:26,641
Don't think about that.

144
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,907
When you leave here everything
will be fine, you'll see.

145
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:34,187
Oh! You'll see, you'll see! What do you
think I see, after the life I've had?!

146
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,107
The others, talk, talk... yes!

147
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:38,963
But I....
Do you know what I think, Stefano?

148
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:43,479
For me death will be the first
good night's sleep I've had in my life.

149
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:46,287
Ready for a nice nap?

150
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:48,886
Yes, Doctor, I'm ready.

151
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:53,406
- So, when will I wake up?
- In two days.

152
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:59,602
Did you hear that? Two days.
Will you come and see me?

153
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:20,483
- Good morning, Sir!
- Good morning, Gianna!

154
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:24,427
- Ooh, if it isn't Stefano! Welcome back!
- Thank you.

155
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:27,027
Mr. Leo, Pennisi is waiting for you,
he's in your study.

156
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:29,027
- Ah, yes, send him in.
- Yes, right way.

157
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:31,227
- Wait for me through there with Gianna.
- Yes, Father.

158
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:32,797
Come on.

159
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:39,326
Giuseppe, go on through!

160
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:43,558
So, you've finished at boarding school?

161
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:47,827
You've lost weight, though.
What, they don't feed you there?

162
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:49,681
Not too much.

163
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:54,667
So, Gianna, how's business?

164
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:56,920
Good, good! As usual.

165
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,757
Who's that?

166
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,121
She's here because of your father.

167
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:37,723
- Gianna, send me Stefano.
- Yes, right away.

168
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:43,286
Pass it on to administration.

169
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,827
Sir, the storekeeper is
waiting for you outside.

170
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:48,027
- What should I tell him?
- Send him in.

171
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:50,667
- Don't tell me you're tired?
- No, no, of course not!

172
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:52,747
Good, because this evening I'm
taking you to a cocktail bar...

173
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:55,067
... where all the intellectuals
in Milan like to hang out.

174
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:56,707
All good people, you know,
my competition, they're always...

175
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,107
... trying to put me out of business,
but never quite manage it!

176
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:01,041
Yes, come in!

177
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,241
Come on, in you come.

178
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,043
Please, come forward.

179
00:16:06,428 --> 00:16:08,281
Don't be afraid.

180
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:15,000
- Are you the storekeeper?
- Yes.

181
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:18,067
I've never seen you before.
How long have you been here?

182
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:19,627
18 months.

183
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:22,667
Listen, would you like to explain
to me why the accounts are showing...

184
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:25,523
... a deficit of 870,000
lire in revenue stamps?

185
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:29,248
I don't know.
I swear on my mother's life.

186
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:33,387
I check them all.
I check them every day.

187
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:34,827
Here, look.

188
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,764
The accounts department is clear,
there's a deficit. Where did it end up?

189
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,307
They must be mistaken.

190
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:43,685
What, machines make mistakes now?

191
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:46,600
I don't know.
Someone must have stole them!

192
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:49,627
There's no doubt that
someone stole them...

193
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:52,005
... but they stole them
from you, not from me.

194
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,027
If the sum isn't returned
within three days...

195
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:57,947
... you will be interrogated by
someone much more qualified than me.

196
00:16:57,948 --> 00:16:59,403
Is that clear?

197
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:01,607
But what can I do, Sir?

198
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:04,523
I earn 60,000 lire a month,
I can't possibly...

199
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:09,002
I couldn't possibly...
How can I, if you don't help me?

200
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:10,917
You may go.

201
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:17,877
Excuse me.

202
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,397
Excuse me.

203
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:29,243
Thank you.

204
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:38,477
He seemed sincere.

205
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:41,600
They always seem sincere.

206
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:44,998
I know, I know, there are
unpleasant situations...

207
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,198
... there are difficult
decisions to make.

208
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:50,601
But unfortunately, that's how it is...

209
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:53,987
... you can't avoid them,
it's part of such responsibility.

210
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,707
If I always allowed my sentiments
to dictate things...

211
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,787
... at this point I'd be
selling books on a market stall.

212
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:04,645
Instead, I have 500 employees.
And if there's a rotten branch...

213
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:09,367
... you must cut it off right away,
if you wish the tree to remain healthy.

214
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,627
Remember them, these words.
Perhaps today they seem absurd...

215
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:15,147
... but when you come to work
for my company...

216
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:17,227
... and hold a position of
some responsibility...

217
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,907
... well, when you're the
one running this place...

218
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:22,147
... you will realise that
there exist two sets of morals:

219
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:25,147
... one for he who commands,
and one for he who obeys.

220
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,479
Yes, my son, unfortunately...

221
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:29,797
... that's the way it is.

222
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,667
One day you will be have
to make unpleasant decisions...

223
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:37,523
... that go against your
own sentiments; I'm sure of it!

224
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:40,324
But there will always be
one important compensation...

225
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,804
... that you are giving work
to 500 families...

226
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:45,467
... meaning 500 fathers
that will have secured...

227
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:48,004
... a future for themselves
and their children.

228
00:18:48,348 --> 00:18:49,917
Do you see?

229
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:52,319
This is what counts...

230
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:56,123
... because the rest is all lies!

231
00:19:03,068 --> 00:19:05,187
Thank goodness you're here!

232
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:08,267
No even Vittoria is coming! She's at
the "Olive Branch" with her mother...

233
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:10,187
... the one who won a good will award...

234
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:12,787
... it's always the same people
and always the same food...

235
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:15,267
See? What am I supposed
to do with all these starters?

236
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:18,328
No one comes here anymore!
Who knows what they'll do, then...

237
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:22,318
Do you want something to drink?
Whisky?

238
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:29,401
- Hey, Morandi!
- Ah, hi, Boss!

239
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,187
- How are you?
- Good, good.

240
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:34,107
Here, this is here my son.
He's a big fan of yours, you know!

241
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:38,726
Stefano, here's your chance!
I'll leave you two to it.

242
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,867
I think I must have read everything
you've written up to this point.

243
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,547
My dear boy, you surprise me.

244
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:49,267
I know of your opinions already,
your father has told me a lot about you.

245
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:52,467
I wouldn't think that a
young catholic, these days...

246
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:54,924
... would be interested in my books.

247
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:58,406
I wouldn't be a good catholic
if I didn't try to understand.

248
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:01,838
When the war was on and
you were just a little boy...

249
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:05,202
... when he really started to read,
to become interested...

250
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:09,200
It's an old industry, you know. Not the
most fitting business for your father.

251
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,987
Italy isn't a country of ideas,
but of electric appliances.

252
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:14,747
I'm surprised that you've read my work.

253
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:16,787
Isn't it the ideas that make a story?

254
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:18,347
No, it's the objects...

255
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:21,203
... or rather, a certain number
of objects that can be sold.

256
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,467
But your ideas are not made of objects.

257
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:26,801
That's why they don't sell,
and why people don't read them.

258
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:35,721
Tell me, have you thought of
going into politics? - No.

259
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,723
- So you'll be working with your father.
- I don't think so, for now.

260
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:43,527
- That's a shame. I hope to see you
at the publishing house. - Of course.

261
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:46,907
I go there three times a week.
Why don't you come?

262
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,443
- Okay!
- Good!

263
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:52,507
Listen, Morandi: don't bother
putting my photo on the cover.

264
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:56,045
- Just do your own nice presentation
and that will be enough. - Okay, okay...

265
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:59,486
- Why, have you written a book?
- Of course? Didn't you know?

266
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:02,763
And you're presenting
my father's book?

267
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:06,284
Of course, Stefano.
Aren't you happy?

268
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:09,347
Who's for some Parmesan?

269
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:11,406
Hey! Hi, Adriana!

270
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:13,547
I came by the office this morning.

271
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:16,427
- Ah, yes. What did you want?
- Nothing, I was just passing.

272
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:19,601
- Ah... do you know my son?
- No.

273
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:21,476
Very well, here he is!

274
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,867
He knows everyone, your father.
He's like the devil.

275
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,199
All at once his heir appears.

276
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:30,322
Good for you!

277
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,427
So, what did Morandi tell you?
He's alright, isn't he? - Yes.

278
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:55,227
He was a smart man. Did 5 years in
Ponza in confinement, under fascism.

279
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:56,747
- Did you know that?
- Yes, I knew.

280
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,067
- Now he's working with you?
- Yes. He's always been a prestigious name.

281
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,227
A moralist who writes in the left-wing
and pseudo left-wing newspapers...

282
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:04,267
Anyway, he's useful.

283
00:22:04,268 --> 00:22:06,387
It's that I'm paying him to do nothing
in particular, that bothers me a little.

284
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:08,227
His books are important.

285
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:11,147
Well! I wouldn't call them important,
but fortunately for us they still work.

286
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:13,387
He's a Saint of the Resistance, you know.

287
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:16,482
Ha! A true idealist!
Even more than you.

288
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,027
You don't much care for idealism,
do you father?

289
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:23,237
Of course not! It's old news, and a
miracle that people still believe in it.

290
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:25,043
Then what are you?

291
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,407
Do you believe in ideas or not?

292
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,878
My son, I don't go to school anymore.

293
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:37,766
These days I'm an industrialist,
meaning someone who believes in facts...

294
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:39,563
... not in ideas.

295
00:22:40,348 --> 00:22:42,667
And tomorrow you'll be an
industrialist yourself...

296
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:45,602
... now that you're done with
your needless education.

297
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:47,397
I don't think so.

298
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,117
You don't think what?

299
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:56,122
I've made a decision, Father,
regarding my life.

300
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:58,757
And what would that be?

301
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:03,448
I've decided to join a convent.

302
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:15,883
Come, come!
Let's at least hear why.

303
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,123
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thank you.

304
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:29,803
I hope...

305
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:32,667
... actually, I'm sure
you don't disapprove, do you?

306
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:35,067
I didn't say anything,
just asked a question:

307
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:36,921
... I asked you why.

308
00:23:37,348 --> 00:23:38,667
What can I tell you?

309
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:42,467
All I can say is that above all
this decision is a necessity for me.

310
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:47,519
Oh, really? Well this necessity of
yours must stem from something...

311
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:51,987
... you know, an opinion on the world,
a long time spent reflecting... or no?

312
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:55,127
- Perhaps I'm mistaken.
- No, you're not mistaken.

313
00:23:56,068 --> 00:24:00,038
It's a result of these past two years,
a combination of opinion and reflection.

314
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:02,437
Just as you say.

315
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,364
Help me understand.
Opinions, reflections... and they are?

316
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:13,568
Meaning, that I feel the need
to believe in something...

317
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:16,547
... immaterial, something idealogical.

318
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:18,907
Careful!
"Idealogical" is a dangerous word.

319
00:24:18,908 --> 00:24:22,427
If a Jesuit heard you talk like that,
he would doubt your career choice.

320
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,307
It's true, but it's so tiring
for me to speak with you.

321
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:27,685
- What? Why?
- Because you...

322
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,307
... don't believe in anything.

323
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:31,560
Who says so?
That's what you're saying.

324
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:34,947
No, I actually quite firmly
believe in many things.

325
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:37,757
You know which?
I believe in power.

326
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,347
And I also believe in money.
Why not?

327
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:43,147
Things that disgust you, I'm sure.
Isn't that right?

328
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:47,402
- Yes, that's true. - I know, I liked
to judge people at your age as well.

329
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:49,667
But becoming a priest isn't necessary.

330
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:53,587
And because, I'm sure that after
just a month you'll be back home.

331
00:24:53,588 --> 00:24:57,046
No. I've decided.
And anyway, you'll see.

332
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:00,443
We'll see.

333
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:05,478
Anyhow, we can talk about it more
tomorrow, can't we?

334
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:10,161
- Go on, go to bed now. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

335
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:37,401
Sorry to wake you.
Listen, I have an idea.

336
00:26:38,428 --> 00:26:41,787
Tomorrow I'll attend to some business,
and then on Saturday we'll take the yacht...

337
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:43,787
... and we'll go out to sea, you and I...

338
00:26:43,788 --> 00:26:45,467
... for a nice trip.

339
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:49,005
That way we can talk and get to
know each other better, can't we?

340
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:52,324
What do you say?
Does it sound like a good idea?

341
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:56,319
Yes, it sounds great!

342
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:58,123
Excellent!

343
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:02,516
Okay, then.

344
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,085
- Night.
- Goodnight, Father.

345
00:27:33,948 --> 00:27:35,517
Hello!

346
00:27:36,508 --> 00:27:38,487
What, you don't say hello?

347
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:41,147
- How are you?
- So, which one is "Noah's Ark"?

348
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:43,684
- What?
- Your father's boat, no?

349
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:47,679
- Why? Are you coming with us?
- Of course! Do you mind?

350
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:49,883
Come on, get in!

351
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:04,067
Well, it's about time!
I was about to leave without you.

352
00:28:04,068 --> 00:28:07,387
It's not like I can fly!
I left as soon as you called me.

353
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:10,107
Wait! Take your shoes off
before coming aboard.

354
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:11,827
Oh, really? Are those the rules?

355
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:15,161
Gian! Take the lady's cases
upstairs, go on!

356
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:18,968
Remember that you're on a yacht,
here, we're not on the street.

357
00:28:29,148 --> 00:28:31,427
You didn't tell me she was coming.

358
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:34,806
- Oh, I didn't?
- No. - Oh, dear.

359
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,487
Hey there, Captain!
Are we ready to cast off?

360
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:42,206
We're ready, Mr. Leo!

361
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:05,603
Higher!

362
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:09,923
Go on, more!

363
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:35,168
You looked good up there.
Aren't you afraid of heights?

364
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:41,877
Hey, where are you going?

365
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:46,884
- To take a shower.
- With all this water around us?

366
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,357
I want to get changed.

367
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:52,278
You're not a very good host, you know!

368
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:57,282
- It wasn't me who invited you.
- Tell me how you really feel!

369
00:29:57,748 --> 00:30:00,603
What do you want me to do,
dive in and swim back to land?

370
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,283
Stefano!

371
00:30:06,268 --> 00:30:08,281
Say, what do you have against me?

372
00:30:09,548 --> 00:30:12,118
- Nothing.
- Then why do you look at me like that?

373
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:15,125
Come on, let's have a chat.

374
00:30:17,188 --> 00:30:18,757
Come on.

375
00:30:32,108 --> 00:30:34,246
- How old are you?
- 23.

376
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:38,356
And... have you been with many men?

377
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:42,368
Are you really interested? It sounds like
you're collecting data for a census!

378
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:46,759
- How do you earn a living?
- Oh, on whatever I find.

379
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:50,081
- In the city there are enough opportunities.
- Like what, for example?

380
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,027
Have you seen those photographs
sailors keep in their cabins?

381
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:55,086
Well, I've done that as well.

382
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:09,202
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes, why not? Of course.

383
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:11,720
Have you ever been with a woman?

384
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:17,524
- Well...
- So, you have?

385
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:22,836
- No.
- Why? Don't you like women?

386
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:26,267
What does that matter?

387
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:28,645
If you liked them,
you would have done it already, no?

388
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:31,507
Is that all you think exists
between a man and a woman?

389
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:33,361
What else could there be?

390
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:37,683
There could be... love.
One could fall in love.

391
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:41,003
That's what I'm saying!
That's what I mean!

392
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:45,208
No, you're saying that love
is to sleep with someone.

393
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:48,206
Of course! What else could it be?

394
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:51,206
You know, you sound so foolish.

395
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:57,804
- So, you would go with anyone?
- No, with the men I like.

396
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:00,716
If someone is good...

397
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:05,907
What does "good" mean to you?

398
00:32:05,908 --> 00:32:09,923
"Good" can mean many different things.
If he buys you things, if he's kind...

399
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,027
But above all if he really wants you...

400
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:16,361
... if he wants only you,
and he wants you at all costs.

401
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:19,881
Then he really loves you.
It's quite rare!

402
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:35,401
So by "good" you mean...

403
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:39,001
... good in general?

404
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:41,987
Good with others, you mean,
good with everyone.

405
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:45,685
No, that's an asshole!
I mean good with me, not with others.

406
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:49,147
If he's good with others,
what would that make me? Just anyone?

407
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:52,481
- And that's it? Nothing else?
- What do you want there to be?

408
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:58,486
So, for you a man is just
something that you find useful?

409
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:03,547
If a woman doesn't look for
protection and affection in a man...

410
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,401
... what does she look for?

411
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:08,402
Anyway, a woman knows right away
what a man is really like.

412
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:13,721
- And what's that?
- I already told you!

413
00:33:14,668 --> 00:33:17,523
It has to be someone who
wants you at all costs.

414
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:21,206
So then you're sure,
you don't have to worry...

415
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:25,317
... you feel supported.
- Yes, even better if he's rich!

416
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:29,887
You're such an idiot!

417
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:09,968
So, Cosimo!
Are you going to put the ladder down?

418
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:12,446
Right away, Sir!

419
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:15,563
Come on, I want to test the water!

420
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:18,827
- Stefano, you can watch me from the boat!
- Yes, Father!

421
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:22,161
- Ready, Mr. Leo!
- Here I am!

422
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:28,077
Beautiful sea, isn't it?

423
00:34:37,268 --> 00:34:40,077
Look at that!
Venus in the flesh!

424
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:45,147
- Beautiful, isn't she? Hi!
- Hello there! What is there to eat?

425
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:47,525
- Are you hungry?
- Mmm, very!

426
00:34:48,468 --> 00:34:50,987
Go on, Federico!
Go and get the food ready!

427
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,716
Right away, Sir.

428
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:54,684
- So have you been with many men?
- Does it interest you that much?

429
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:59,678
Your face and eyes are so childlike...

430
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:03,601
... and yet you're so different.
You're like...

431
00:36:05,268 --> 00:36:08,123
... like something without a soul,
without anything!

432
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:10,727
You're a difficult one, aren't you?

433
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,441
You think a little too much.

434
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:23,598
That's why you've never
been with a woman.

435
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:29,004
- Why, shouldn't one think?
- Yes, yes, but you see...

436
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:31,077
What?

437
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:33,679
Not if one thinks like you, you know.

438
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,128
Go on, I know it's just a
phase you're going through.

439
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:41,643
- So, am I "good" enough for you?
- I'd say so.

440
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:44,707
- And why is that?
- Because you have nice eyes...

441
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:47,483
... you're well built,
and you also have strong hands.

442
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:51,961
- So what I think doesn't interest you?
- Of course not! Why should it?

443
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:56,284
- And anyway, I already know you.
- What do you mean by that?

444
00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:00,407
Go on, you know what I mean!

445
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:32,319
- Why did you say that you already know me?
- I know you a little.

446
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:38,561
- Look out, Adriana!
- How disgusting!

447
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:42,347
In olden times they fed little
girls like you to the eels.

448
00:37:42,348 --> 00:37:44,947
I'd kill someone before they
could do that to me.

449
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:48,547
That's gratitude for you.
You tire yourself out catching dinner...

450
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:51,267
... and all you get back is death threats.

451
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,667
But you see: there has always been...

452
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:55,267
... a war between the snake and the woman...

453
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:58,805
... ever since the famous apple,
the original sin.

454
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,147
It'll never be over between them, you know.

455
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,667
And everyone screams:
"Where there's woman, there's sin."

456
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:05,347
So, get rid of the woman...

457
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:07,122
... get rid of sex.

458
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:11,038
We must be chaste, pure, impotent...

459
00:38:11,068 --> 00:38:13,524
And of course, that's the problem...

460
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:16,187
... sex maniacs, sick in the head...

461
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,724
... and the women, frigid and immaculate.

462
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:23,245
You would think that it
would be something so simple...

463
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:25,841
... so right, no?

464
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,227
Far from good and bad!

465
00:38:29,228 --> 00:38:33,687
That's the only relationship.
Remember that, my boy...

466
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:37,886
... the natural relationship
between the male and the female.

467
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:44,796
So tell me,
do you have something against women?

468
00:38:45,828 --> 00:38:49,206
No. I find them very beautiful.

469
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:45,804
Hey, look at that, those five stars.

470
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:49,787
That's Orion's constellation,
also called "The Hunter".

471
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:53,587
And over there, those three in a triangle,
that's the Greater Dog.

472
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:57,160
Well! I'll never understand how
you can see a dog in the stars!

473
00:39:57,348 --> 00:39:59,600
Well, it's very simple.

474
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:02,467
And because our ancestors probably
had a better imagination than us.

475
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,526
So what's changed?

476
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:08,205
Nothing has changed,
it's just that we know more now.

477
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:11,922
And science will inevitably kill poetry.

478
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:16,387
For example: when someone living in the
olden times saw lightning, they thought of God.

479
00:40:16,388 --> 00:40:19,107
These days we know it's electrical discharge.

480
00:40:19,108 --> 00:40:21,564
This is why we're less religious.

481
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:26,707
And what would you do if you saw
a gigantic hand in the sky, right now...

482
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,827
... pointing a finger down at you?

483
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:31,284
Well, nothing!
What do you think I'd do?

484
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:34,084
I'd repent my sins.

485
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:42,798
Stefano, find my constellation for me.
I'm a Sagittarius.

486
00:40:44,668 --> 00:40:46,886
Well, you see those five stars?

487
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:50,202
That's the bow and that's the arrow.

488
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:54,326
And you, Leo, what star sign are you?

489
00:40:54,988 --> 00:40:57,638
- I'm a Sagittarius as well.
- No good!

490
00:40:57,868 --> 00:41:00,359
A Sagittarius never gets
on with another Sagittarius.

491
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:06,396
What about you, Stefano?
What sign are you, Virgo?

492
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:12,043
- Gemini.
- Sagittarius and Gemini: assured happiness.

493
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:16,121
- Say, are you going to bed?
- Yes, and you?

494
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:19,387
We'll stay out here a little longer.

495
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:22,686
No one is to wake me before
9 O'clock, understood?

496
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:25,440
Then we'll let you sleep.

497
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:27,837
Goodnight.

498
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,763
- Stefano...
- Yes?

499
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:42,162
Tell me the truth, now.
You were just joking when you mentioned...

500
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:46,168
... closing yourself in a convent
with your prayer beads.

501
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:48,361
It's not a joke.

502
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,278
It's crazy talk. I mean...

503
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:54,347
... how on earth did you come
up with such an idea?

504
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:56,467
It's a decision I've spent a
lot of time thinking over.

505
00:41:56,468 --> 00:42:00,677
- Really? Since when?
- This last year at school.

506
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:06,467
I see, but you know that at your age
many people make rash decisions.

507
00:42:06,468 --> 00:42:09,482
- Let's at least talk about it.
- Yes, of course.

508
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:11,747
So you would believe in God...

509
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:15,877
... in the Son, the Holy Ghost,
in Immaculate Conception? - Exactly.

510
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:18,207
Don't you realise how that sounds?

511
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:21,067
Men are about to set foot on the Moon...

512
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:23,604
... and you still believe in such lies?

513
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:28,362
And you're an intelligent kid!
How can you believe in such things?

514
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:29,997
Why?

515
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:33,085
It's all clear to you, is it?

516
00:42:33,108 --> 00:42:35,564
Everything simple,
everything explained...

517
00:42:36,308 --> 00:42:38,560
Mysteries just don't exist, do they?

518
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:42,347
Don't you realise that,
to reason in the way that you reason...

519
00:42:42,348 --> 00:42:44,027
... is merely to simplify things...

520
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,787
... to see only the superficial,
and not the substance in things?

521
00:42:46,788 --> 00:42:50,507
Unfortunately, the substance in things
is the thing itself, all else is lies!

522
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:51,997
No.

523
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:54,247
No, no, I'll never see that.

524
00:42:54,388 --> 00:42:56,526
Otherwise I might as well be dead.

525
00:42:57,828 --> 00:43:01,587
There exists higher values, believe me,
than things, than money, than power.

526
00:43:01,588 --> 00:43:04,966
And what power, anyway?
And for how long?

527
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:09,402
- It doesn't matter how long it lasts,
just that it lasts. - There, you see...

528
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:12,707
... I like to think that we have
the right to live better lives...

529
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:16,507
... without staining ourselves, without
marking our conscience. - Oh, really!

530
00:43:16,508 --> 00:43:19,147
Just to be clear:
in a world that isn't religious...

531
00:43:19,148 --> 00:43:21,525
... I wish to live religiously.

532
00:43:21,788 --> 00:43:25,724
And what about me?
You don't think about me, do you?

533
00:43:26,388 --> 00:43:29,322
You want to love everyone, except me.

534
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,507
You don't realise that it's
because I have just one son...

535
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:36,045
... that I've worked for my
whole life, up to this point?

536
00:43:36,628 --> 00:43:39,961
You don't do it for me,
you do it for yourself.

537
00:43:40,228 --> 00:43:43,288
Because that's how you are,
because it's your calling.

538
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:46,559
Mine is different, actually,
the opposite.

539
00:43:47,108 --> 00:43:49,564
And I've decided to follow
it with all my heart.

540
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:02,398
Anyway, I'll never allow it!

541
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:05,320
Now, that's enough talking.
Alright?

542
00:44:05,868 --> 00:44:08,086
Then I'll be forced speak with you again.

543
00:44:08,628 --> 00:44:11,547
When we go home I'm leaving
you and moving to the convent.

544
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:15,120
- Which convent, anyway? - I've already
spoken to them, they're waiting for me.

545
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:21,443
- You're still just a minor.
- Yes.

546
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:24,559
- I'm asking you for permission.
- Ah, no!

547
00:44:25,028 --> 00:44:28,201
I won't give you anything,
not until you're 21 years old!

548
00:44:29,148 --> 00:44:33,004
That's not right, Father. What,
are you forcing me to disobey you?

549
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:37,347
If I stop you doing this foolishness,
one day you'll thank me.

550
00:44:37,348 --> 00:44:39,167
It's useless, Father!

551
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,884
I'm sorry, but this is my path.

552
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:45,479
This is very upsetting for me, you know?

553
00:44:45,948 --> 00:44:49,087
I'm sorry Father, but you've
caused me a lot of pain.

554
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:51,683
Ah, I have?

555
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:55,686
What about the pain that
you've caused me?

556
00:44:56,668 --> 00:44:59,728
Do you think that I'm indifferent
to the fact that I might lose a son...

557
00:45:00,068 --> 00:45:02,923
... now, at the exact moment
that I've found him once again?

558
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,907
But you won't lose me!

559
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:08,241
You'll always be my father, it's
just that you'll have a priest for a son.

560
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:12,844
I already told you that having a priest
for a son is something I will not tolerate!

561
00:45:13,788 --> 00:45:16,677
It's an idea that mortifies me,
that disgusts me!

562
00:45:17,108 --> 00:45:19,347
I want a son who follows in my footsteps...

563
00:45:19,348 --> 00:45:21,600
... who continues what I've started...

564
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:23,667
But Father...

565
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:27,399
... don't you understand that
I can never work with you? Never!

566
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:37,322
Do you think that I could live like you,
ordering people around, people who..

567
00:45:37,348 --> 00:45:40,999
... only obey me because they're afraid?
- No! You're the one who's afraid!

568
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:45,067
People talk how you're talking
when they're afraid and weak.

569
00:45:45,068 --> 00:45:46,987
This is life!

570
00:45:46,988 --> 00:45:51,037
He who commands, and he who obeys!
It's always been the same, my dear boy!

571
00:45:53,788 --> 00:46:00,443
Yes, but you're not interested in living,
you just want to hide behind a robe...

572
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,158
... just like your mother hides
herself away in those clinics.

573
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:06,187
This isn't a career, it's cowardice,
that's what it is...

574
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:08,427
... and I don't want a coward for a son.

575
00:46:08,428 --> 00:46:11,078
But I'll make you change your mind,
my dear priest.

576
00:46:11,428 --> 00:46:13,805
We'll see if you're strong enough.

577
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:17,288
Come on, don't be afraid,
defend yourself!

578
00:46:17,948 --> 00:46:21,087
You have the strength of your vocation, no?
Then fight!

579
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:25,000
Let's see how you do, with
all your saints and holy mothers!

580
00:46:25,868 --> 00:46:27,403
I pity you.

581
00:46:52,588 --> 00:46:54,043
Stefano!

582
00:46:58,028 --> 00:46:59,563
Hey...

583
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:03,077
What have you done?

584
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:05,361
Come on, in here.

585
00:49:03,788 --> 00:49:07,507
- Captain, we're just off Cala Brigantina!
- Very Good, Mr. Leo!

586
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:09,566
Half an hour early...

587
00:49:14,028 --> 00:49:16,484
My estimates are always exact.

588
00:49:19,948 --> 00:49:23,201
- Hey! Hi! Did you sleep well?
- Yes, thank you.

589
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:28,327
Where are we going?

590
00:49:33,468 --> 00:49:35,720
Where's Stefano?
Still sleeping?

591
00:49:37,188 --> 00:49:41,237
- How should I know?
- You should know, shouldn't you?

592
00:49:57,748 --> 00:50:01,524
Hey! Wake up, sleepy head!
Come on, it's a wonderful day!

593
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:08,241
- Where are we?
- In the shallows of Palmarola.

594
00:50:08,388 --> 00:50:10,587
Come on, let's go fishing!

595
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:12,237
Come on, get up.

596
00:50:17,108 --> 00:50:18,927
I want to leave.

597
00:50:19,388 --> 00:50:20,877
What?

598
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:23,838
If you drop me ashore at Ponza,
I'll take the ferry.

599
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:25,757
What are you upset about now?

600
00:50:26,388 --> 00:50:29,107
Are you still thinking about that
stupid discussion from last night?

601
00:50:29,108 --> 00:50:31,360
Our holiday has only just started.

602
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,439
- We won't speak about it again, okay?
- Father!

603
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:41,565
- Let me leave, please.
- Where? - I want to leave, Father.

604
00:50:42,828 --> 00:50:45,000
Come here a moment, come closer.

605
00:50:55,868 --> 00:50:59,599
What's all this about you wanting
to leave? Has something happened?

606
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:07,324
- No.
- Then what's this tantrum all about?

607
00:51:08,268 --> 00:51:09,987
You should stay here. You'll see...

608
00:51:09,988 --> 00:51:12,524
... it's a beautiful island,
I'm sure that you'll really like it.

609
00:52:17,148 --> 00:52:20,082
Young master! What are you doing?!

610
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:32,603
Hey, you!

611
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,962
Hey, you!

612
00:53:00,148 --> 00:53:01,717
Stop!

613
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:05,197
Help, Father!

614
00:53:14,668 --> 00:53:16,237
Father!

615
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:23,446
Father, help me!

616
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:28,803
Father!

617
00:53:32,388 --> 00:53:34,003
Help me!

618
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:36,123
Help...

619
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:39,917
Go!

620
00:53:40,668 --> 00:53:42,396
I'm sorry!

621
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:45,157
Help!

622
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,837
Pull alongside him.

623
00:55:06,468 --> 00:55:08,117
Leave me alone.

624
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:10,762
Yes, of course, right away.

625
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,907
I just brought you some cognac,
that's if you want it.

626
00:55:13,908 --> 00:55:15,443
No, thank you.

627
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:24,567
You know, Stefano, I'm really
not interested if you drink or not.

628
00:55:26,068 --> 00:55:29,878
The thing that worries me is your
inclination to always say "no".

629
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:34,397
If you always say "no", people will
stop offering you things.

630
00:55:35,948 --> 00:55:37,722
I said "thank you".

631
00:55:38,308 --> 00:55:40,446
Yes, I know, you have good manners.

632
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:46,247
This is a nice watch!
Is it yours? Did you buy it?

633
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:50,038
Yes.

634
00:55:50,228 --> 00:55:51,763
Where?

635
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,082
- In Losanna.
- Ah! In Losanna!

636
00:55:57,348 --> 00:56:00,316
- Father...
- Yes?

637
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:05,638
For the first time in my life...

638
00:56:08,188 --> 00:56:11,248
... I've sinned.
I've betrayed both you and myself.

639
00:56:12,308 --> 00:56:13,843
Last night...

640
00:56:14,908 --> 00:56:16,523
What?

641
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:21,364
- I slept with Adriana.
- I had imagined as much.

642
00:56:22,308 --> 00:56:25,276
Besides, I saw it coming,
considering how you act together.

643
00:56:25,628 --> 00:56:27,880
Why won't you let me off?

644
00:56:28,828 --> 00:56:30,727
Order them to dock somewhere.

645
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:32,147
I'll go away.

646
00:56:32,148 --> 00:56:34,320
Go where, Stefano?

647
00:56:35,268 --> 00:56:36,803
I don't know.

648
00:56:38,868 --> 00:56:42,121
- Help me, Father!
- How can I, if you won't let me?

649
00:56:44,988 --> 00:56:51,358
Father, please, I didn't know...
I swear, I didn't mean to...

650
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,043
What do you mean?

651
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:56,477
Adriana...

652
00:56:58,508 --> 00:57:01,238
What do I care about Adriana?

653
00:57:01,828 --> 00:57:05,957
No, it's you I'm thinking about.
It's you I'm worried about.

654
00:57:06,908 --> 00:57:09,547
Don't you see that you even you
really don't know what you want?

655
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:12,004
You can't make that decision.

656
00:57:12,148 --> 00:57:16,667
If your chosen career was one of
sincerity, authenticity, honesty...

657
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:19,807
... I would have probably given in.

658
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:24,116
But how long has it lasted,
that which we spoke about?

659
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:28,480
So then, how can you still
think of it as your true calling?

660
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:33,437
No. I know.

661
00:57:34,908 --> 00:57:38,320
It's not that I'm always right about
everything, quite the opposite...

662
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:41,644
... but I take my reasoning from facts.

663
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,766
You cannot be chaste.

664
00:57:45,108 --> 00:57:49,237
No one was born for chastity, no one.
Get that into your head.

665
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:52,717
I know.

666
00:57:54,188 --> 00:57:55,837
I know.

667
00:57:57,828 --> 00:57:59,681
Now it's all over.

668
00:58:01,348 --> 00:58:04,806
All these years of renunciation,
of exaltation...

669
00:58:06,228 --> 00:58:08,207
... only to arrive at this...

670
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:11,276
... at this betrayal!

671
00:58:11,748 --> 00:58:13,522
What betrayal?

672
00:58:14,788 --> 00:58:18,227
Actually, I find it right,
the thing you did...

673
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,446
... it's so human, natural.

674
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:23,643
Evidently...

675
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:26,602
... strength of will isn't enough.

676
00:58:28,388 --> 00:58:29,923
And just like that...

677
00:58:30,828 --> 00:58:32,363
... it's over!

678
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:36,962
- What's over?
- Everything, Father! Everything!

679
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:43,764
Nothing is over, my son,
quite the opposite...

680
00:58:44,028 --> 00:58:48,203
Now you will start again,
start your life alongside me.

681
00:59:02,548 --> 00:59:07,041
I need you, Stefano.
My strength isn't what it was.

682
00:59:07,908 --> 00:59:09,907
I'm an old man, my son.

683
00:59:09,908 --> 00:59:13,400
It's not easy always being so hard, intolerant.

684
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:15,487
And only you can help me.

685
00:59:16,468 --> 00:59:20,517
What can I do?
You know how to do everything...

686
00:59:21,068 --> 00:59:22,603
... all you need is you.

687
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:26,521
But you can do... you can do so much.

688
00:59:27,988 --> 00:59:29,841
Come to Milan with me.

689
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:33,107
We can run the publishing house together.

690
00:59:33,108 --> 00:59:38,363
- Wouldn't you like that, Stefano?
- Yes, I would.

691
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:41,446
Good! It's yours, you know!

692
00:59:41,908 --> 00:59:45,957
You can choose which books you want
and you'll have fun, you'll see.

693
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:51,006
Books aren't just money, you know,
they're ideas, important things...

694
00:59:51,468 --> 00:59:53,526
For a young man like you...

695
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:56,807
... it will be a duty just
as noble as religion.

696
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,201
Well, get some rest, now.

697
01:00:12,228 --> 01:00:14,002
- Father...
- Yes?

698
01:00:14,788 --> 01:00:17,677
When did you and Mother
start hating each other?

699
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:23,280
When we got married.

700
01:00:24,228 --> 01:00:25,683
Sleep.

701
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,806
- He saw you, Father!
- So?

702
01:01:13,988 --> 01:01:15,587
He took your license plate number!

703
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,760
Well, I hope it brings him luck!
It ends in 13, you know!

704
01:01:26,068 --> 01:01:28,957
- Welcome back, Sir!
- Thank you!

705
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:43,107
- Welcome back, Sir!
- Thank you, Gianna! Any news?

706
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:46,307
Lots of letters and two calls from
Brockhaus, about the dictionary.

707
01:01:46,308 --> 01:01:47,957
Good morning, Sir!

708
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,237
I....

709
01:01:57,748 --> 01:02:00,067
Stefano!
What are you doing, Stefano?

710
01:02:00,068 --> 01:02:01,796
Here I am, Father!

711
01:02:02,948 --> 01:02:04,801
Come on!

712
01:02:06,948 --> 01:02:09,147
- What were you doing back there?
- Nothing.

713
01:02:09,148 --> 01:02:13,277
- And does he have a say in the commission?
- Of course, he has the decisive vote!

714
01:02:13,388 --> 01:02:16,067
- Then send him a cheque.
- A cheque?!

715
01:02:16,068 --> 01:02:21,164
Of course, a cheque!
We'll see if he sends it back.

716
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:25,478
It's not an offence, you know.
Want something to drink, Stefano?

717
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,487
- A whisky?
- Okay.

718
01:02:27,948 --> 01:02:31,884
Eight volumes in a single month...
I'll have to increase production.

719
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,867
I ask myself how you sell so many.

720
01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:37,467
- It's not like people read that much.
- Oh, but they sure do sell!

721
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:40,667
In Italy the book has become
a consumer good these days.

722
01:02:40,668 --> 01:02:43,107
- Yes. But do they read them?
- How should I know?

723
01:02:43,108 --> 01:02:45,707
Anyway, they buy them,
and that's what counts.

724
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:49,166
They buy them as they would
buy a tie or a pair of shoes.

725
01:03:00,748 --> 01:03:02,267
What happened?

726
01:03:02,268 --> 01:03:07,000
- What happened?!
- The storekeeper, out the window!

727
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:14,405
Ribechi, call the police!
Out of here, you! Go on!

728
01:03:22,108 --> 01:03:25,202
- Where are you going? - Father, let go of me!
- Stay right where you are!

729
01:03:39,388 --> 01:03:42,243
Give me a cover, something...
Here!

730
01:03:51,468 --> 01:03:53,560
Away! Get away from him!

731
01:04:09,908 --> 01:04:13,639
Get away, go on! Get back inside!

732
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:26,767
Very well, Sir. Yes...

733
01:04:30,388 --> 01:04:33,641
No, no responsibility!
Hey, what can you do...

734
01:04:34,988 --> 01:04:36,637
Okay, the one....

735
01:04:36,908 --> 01:04:39,797
Sort it out for me. A couple of million
or even more, it doesn't matter.

736
01:04:40,348 --> 01:04:42,600
These things happen...

737
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:45,606
Very well. Let me know...

738
01:05:14,028 --> 01:05:16,787
I don't want the newspapers to breath
as much as a breath a word of this!

739
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:19,267
Everyone looks to make a
scandal out of a story like this!

740
01:05:19,268 --> 01:05:21,787
Don't worry, I told you.
No one will talk about it.

741
01:05:21,788 --> 01:05:24,707
I still have some authority left.
It's nothing to do with you, is it?

742
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:26,627
- Do you want something to eat?
- Why not?

743
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:30,677
- Vincenzo! Prepare a plate of cold
meats for the professor. - Right away!

744
01:05:31,068 --> 01:05:33,320
Are you eating with us, Stefano?

745
01:05:37,748 --> 01:05:39,907
- Good evening!
- Good evening, Ribechi. Well?

746
01:05:39,908 --> 01:05:43,307
- The father of the boy is here with me.
- Ah, good!

747
01:05:43,308 --> 01:05:46,707
I convinced him. Though perhaps now it's best
if you talk to him. You know...

748
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,667
... how these things are...
- Yes, of course. Where is he?

749
01:05:48,668 --> 01:05:50,107
I left him downstairs in the car.

750
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:52,707
I already hinted at the amount you
mentioned earlier...

751
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:56,166
... and he's in agreement, he doesn't
wish to make a fuss. - Okay, okay. Come on.

752
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:07,566
And just like that, you...

753
01:06:07,908 --> 01:06:09,682
... the moralist...

754
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:14,147
... the one who dishes out morals to
Italians in the newspapers every week...

755
01:06:14,148 --> 01:06:16,798
... is hired to cover up a murder.

756
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:19,645
With your pure man facade...

757
01:06:19,668 --> 01:06:22,363
... you've bought the public...

758
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:27,747
... the newspapers, everyone, and you've
placed a rock on top of a murder.

759
01:06:27,748 --> 01:06:31,206
What murder?
That guy was just crazy!

760
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:33,467
Go on, Stefano, I'm surprised at you.

761
01:06:33,468 --> 01:06:35,117
Surprised?

762
01:06:35,268 --> 01:06:37,387
Surprised how sick you make me?

763
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:39,526
You, my father, everyone.

764
01:06:39,908 --> 01:06:42,987
Do you know that he was just an
unfortunate kid, that he wasn't to blame?

765
01:06:42,988 --> 01:06:46,446
A harmless being, a desperate boy.

766
01:06:48,428 --> 01:06:50,467
I saw him, he came to me...

767
01:06:50,468 --> 01:06:53,960
... and for a measly million lire
they pushed him to suicide!

768
01:06:54,108 --> 01:06:56,387
I beg you, can you not go
to the newspapers tomorrow...

769
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:58,867
... tonight, right away, and
tell them everything that happened?

770
01:06:58,868 --> 01:07:01,627
Tell them about a mad man who
threw himself out of a window?

771
01:07:01,628 --> 01:07:03,686
I beg you, do something!

772
01:07:04,348 --> 01:07:06,067
I beg you, do it...

773
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:09,401
... now, right away, no matter
how much money my father gives you!

774
01:07:09,468 --> 01:07:11,924
What should I do, in your opinion?

775
01:07:12,148 --> 01:07:13,467
Make a scandal!

776
01:07:13,468 --> 01:07:15,987
I'll be with you, against my father,
I swear it!

777
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:18,126
Alright, Stefano, that will do!

778
01:07:18,188 --> 01:07:19,627
Such a fuss!

779
01:07:19,628 --> 01:07:22,562
Yes, such a fuss for
someone who just died...

780
01:07:23,228 --> 01:07:26,800
And for who none of you give
a damn about, you most of all.

781
01:07:29,068 --> 01:07:31,206
So, you're corrupt too.

782
01:07:31,788 --> 01:07:35,121
You're up to your neck
in the world of the sly, too.

783
01:07:36,988 --> 01:07:39,319
All done! What did I tell you?

784
01:07:42,908 --> 01:07:45,797
Everything can be sorted out
with a little goodwill.

785
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,027
Now he's speaking with the
lawyer and then he'll be gone.

786
01:07:48,028 --> 01:07:50,507
- Did you leave him downstairs alone?
- Well, he asked me to.

787
01:07:50,508 --> 01:07:54,107
And we have to be careful about these things,
we don't want him to lose his head.

788
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:56,667
Vincenzo, call the gentleman
downstairs in the car...

789
01:07:56,668 --> 01:07:59,762
... and offer him something to eat.
- Right away, Sir! - Let's go.

790
01:08:07,988 --> 01:08:11,844
- Stefano, sit down!
- Stefano is quite agitated.

791
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:14,627
I know, he's always agitated.

792
01:08:14,628 --> 01:08:18,107
He'll end up in one of those beds
next to his mother at a clinic.

793
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:20,547
Perhaps you should listen to him,
that might be better.

794
01:08:20,548 --> 01:08:22,827
Oh, of course! Come no!
Let him speak...

795
01:08:22,828 --> 01:08:25,762
... he can tell us what the Bible
says we should do at this point.

796
01:08:34,748 --> 01:08:37,284
How boring your irony is, Father.

797
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:40,727
It sounds bad, vulgar.

798
01:08:42,348 --> 01:08:44,327
And you know why it's vulgar?

799
01:08:44,668 --> 01:08:46,726
Because it's useless, Father.

800
01:08:47,588 --> 01:08:49,316
You're not funny.

801
01:08:52,268 --> 01:08:54,042
You're not a good person!

802
01:08:59,828 --> 01:09:01,886
Did you hear that, Morandi?

803
01:09:02,468 --> 01:09:05,801
If I'm not mistaken, you were the
one who wanted him to talk...

804
01:09:06,268 --> 01:09:09,726
... and you only ended up
angering our little altar boy here.

805
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:13,238
But since all of this talk was started...

806
01:09:13,268 --> 01:09:16,202
... because of some crazy guy who
threw himself out of a window...

807
01:09:17,188 --> 01:09:20,646
... even if I wanted to,
I can't resurrect the dead.

808
01:09:21,308 --> 01:09:24,242
I can, however, pay them,
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

809
01:09:24,388 --> 01:09:27,067
You may as well spit on them,
too, if you're going to pay them.

810
01:09:27,068 --> 01:09:29,160
Don't talk like your mother.

811
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:37,482
You spit on everything.

812
01:12:36,468 --> 01:12:40,119
You did the right thing to call me.
I wasn't sure I'd hear from you again!

813
01:12:41,348 --> 01:12:43,804
Well? How do I look?

814
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,163
Good!

815
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:51,043
Actually, tonight I look terrible.

816
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:54,720
I ruined all my skin on that damn boat.

817
01:12:55,068 --> 01:12:58,427
I shouldn't have come, I know.
But the trip was quite nice.

818
01:12:58,428 --> 01:13:01,587
- Did you know that I've not
seen your father since then? - No?

819
01:13:01,588 --> 01:13:04,761
Of course, I couldn't after
what happened between us.

820
01:13:04,908 --> 01:13:07,267
To tell you the truth,
I'd have carried on all the same...

821
01:13:07,268 --> 01:13:09,587
... it was clear that he
only invited me for you...

822
01:13:09,588 --> 01:13:11,726
... so it can't have offended him.

823
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:15,441
You don't think so?
I think that's exactly why he invited me.

824
01:13:17,868 --> 01:13:20,467
Anyway, I don't regret it.

825
01:13:20,468 --> 01:13:23,547
Do you know what I told him?
"Alright, Leo, I won't make a fuss."

826
01:13:23,548 --> 01:13:25,925
"I'll pack my case and leave."

827
01:13:26,228 --> 01:13:28,267
As if I didn't know why he asked me to come.

828
01:13:28,268 --> 01:13:32,238
And anyway, it's true, because if
I'd known, I wouldn't have done it.

829
01:13:35,668 --> 01:13:39,126
No! Well, for you I'd have done it.

830
01:13:41,468 --> 01:13:43,526
What's wrong? Are you sad?

831
01:13:46,668 --> 01:13:49,507
What can you do? I'm a little sad,
you know, because I ended up...

832
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,747
... really liking Leo.

833
01:13:51,748 --> 01:13:54,000
He's quite charming, don't you find?

834
01:13:55,828 --> 01:13:57,443
Never mind!

835
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:17,324
Anyway, it's not like I'm being left alone.

836
01:14:18,388 --> 01:14:21,227
Ah, my darling, I could never
carry on without someone in my life.

837
01:14:21,228 --> 01:14:23,827
And anyway, with the money he gave me...

838
01:14:23,828 --> 01:14:27,479
I bought two apartments:
one to rent, and the other to live in.

839
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:30,398
But I have to finish paying for
them before the year's out.

840
01:14:32,628 --> 01:14:34,787
You're not happy to own your own place?

841
01:14:34,788 --> 01:14:37,867
Of course! But you need money, and lots of it.

842
01:14:37,868 --> 01:14:40,199
Money is something your father understands.

843
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:43,045
What can you do? The world is what it is!

844
01:14:43,268 --> 01:14:45,467
Your father is right about that, too.

845
01:14:45,468 --> 01:14:47,447
- Don't you find?
- No.

846
01:14:48,388 --> 01:14:50,037
He's not right.

847
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:53,827
A world in which my father is
right can never be good.

848
01:14:53,828 --> 01:14:58,685
Take it from me, Stefano, live your life!
Live, and don't think! It's better that way!

849
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:07,637
But how?

850
01:15:08,548 --> 01:15:10,322
How am I supposed to live?

851
01:15:24,108 --> 01:15:26,267
Come inside with me for a minute...

852
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:28,307
... you could use a distraction.

853
01:15:28,308 --> 01:15:30,958
- What are you going to do?
- My brother is in there.

854
01:15:30,988 --> 01:15:33,160
I need to help him with something,
then we can leave.

855
01:15:33,508 --> 01:15:37,523
He gets into a mess every day,
imagine if I didn't keep an eye on him!

856
01:15:41,508 --> 01:15:44,761
So, are you coming?
Come on, I'll take you home afterwards.

857
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:48,283
- What are we really doing, anyway?
- Right.

858
01:15:48,428 --> 01:15:51,681
- Why, what do you want to do?
- Exactly, where are we going?

859
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:55,601
You're right, the world is what
it is and can't be changed.

860
01:15:55,868 --> 01:15:57,517
That's more like it!

861
01:15:57,868 --> 01:16:01,201
I'm rich, and I'll defend my money...

862
01:16:02,268 --> 01:16:03,867
... just like my father does.

863
01:16:03,868 --> 01:16:05,847
Finally, you understand!

864
01:16:06,308 --> 01:16:09,845
Lucky you!
And anyway, money does grows on trees!
