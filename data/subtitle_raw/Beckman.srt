2
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:31,571
The fires are getting worse.

3
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:36,376
Every year it's getting worse.

4
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:43,416
I say let it burn.

5
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,118
Let it all burn.

6
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,223
I owe you for this one.

7
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:02,435
Warner Hayes is back in town,
back in The Network.

8
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:06,106
I won't fight him.

9
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,181
Hayes, stop!

10
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:18,118
Stop!

11
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,587
You were out!

12
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,455
Why are you doing this?

13
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,057
I got no choice!

14
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:29,062
If he comes for me...

15
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:32,265
<i>You were out.</i>

16
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,568
There is no way out.

17
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,170
We are who we are.

18
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,367
Stop! Stop this. Just stop.

19
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,565
No!

20
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:49,442
<i>If he comes for me...</i>

21
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:54,280
<i>I won't fight him.</i>

22
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:00,220
<i>He's the closest thing
I have to a brother.</i>

23
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:18,238
Save yourself.

24
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:23,543
Beckman!

25
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:25,445
We know you're in there!

26
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:26,680
Come on, get it open!

27
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:29,349
Come on, hurry up!

28
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:31,484
Come on, spread out!

29
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:34,254
Watch the body!

30
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,193
<i>I need to get out.</i>

31
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:43,363
<i>There's got be a way out.</i>

32
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:47,667
This is the life
you chose, Beckman.

33
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:52,305
There's no way out,
no retirement plan,

34
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:55,308
no pearly gates. Accept it.

35
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,595
I don't know what to do,
Lord, I...

36
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,331
Guide me.

37
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:21,634
I have to choose.

38
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,804
Medicine or the church.

39
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,842
It won't be long before it's...

40
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,512
my medicine or my home.

41
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:35,615
Please guide me.

42
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:49,063
I need help.

43
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,797
God! What happened?

44
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:53,833
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No, don't!

45
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:55,301
Please.

46
00:04:55,335 --> 00:04:58,538
A donation. 350,000.

47
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,806
It's yours.

48
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:02,742
I need help.

49
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:06,279
This is a house of God.

50
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,649
I know.

51
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:36,376
I believe this
is from you, Lord.

52
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:59,532
"As far as the
east is from the west,

53
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:03,703
so far does he remove
our transgressions from us."

54
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,772
We've been over this before.
I've got it.

55
00:06:05,805 --> 00:06:06,907
Do you?

56
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,842
Why'd you take me in?

57
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:11,879
If it wasn't for the money?

58
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,381
I have my personal reasons.

59
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,752
That's between me and God.

60
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:25,860
I'm here.
I want to believe, I...

61
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:26,894
You're not ready.

62
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,363
You have to let go.

63
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:33,433
Allow the Almighty
to control your life.

64
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,536
That person you were before...

65
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,706
that person has to die.

66
00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:42,176
And are you ready
to let it all go?

67
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,878
All the people you harmed?

68
00:06:45,045 --> 00:06:46,914
Be honest.

69
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,920
Father, forgive me.

70
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:56,924
God forgive me.

71
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:48,976
In the jungle...

72
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:52,845
15 miles west of Khe Sanh,

73
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:55,682
I killed 11 men.

74
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,053
Boys.

75
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:03,223
They never stood
a chance. They...

76
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,725
They gave me a medal
for that.

77
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:11,564
When it was my time
to go home, I... I stayed.

78
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,800
I don't know why.

79
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,769
Maybe somehow I thought
I could make things right.

80
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,108
I was lost, completely lost.

81
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:24,278
That's when God finds us.

82
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:27,780
When the lies, denial...

83
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:30,650
ego is gone.

84
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:35,856
And there's nothing left
between you and your creator.

85
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,626
Remember
what you've learned.

86
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:44,831
<i>Promise me.</i>

87
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,036
I promise.

88
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:28,775
Death.

89
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:31,111
That's what it took
to get through to Pharaoh.

90
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,916
The death of his infant son.

91
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:38,785
So he let Moses
and his people go.

92
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:41,889
But then his grief
turned to anger.

93
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:45,691
And he sent the chariots
after Moses.

94
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:53,699
But when God saw that
his people were safe, he...

95
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:57,804
drowned the entire
Egyptian army.

96
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:01,108
An army couldn't deter
God's will.

97
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,178
An army couldn't
stand against...

98
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,081
God's might.

99
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:12,052
So what makes you think
you can?

100
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,888
You can't fool God.

101
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:17,091
He knows who you are.

102
00:10:18,258 --> 00:10:20,894
He knows what you've done.

103
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,099
He knows.

104
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,105
That's it for today.

105
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:46,652
Reverend.
You going somewhere?

106
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:48,122
Sorry, Abby. I...

107
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:50,858
I don't...

108
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,759
I'm not fooling anyone.
I don't belong here.

109
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:56,729
I don't know
what I was thinking.

110
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:58,664
You're having a bad spell.

111
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,833
- We've been through this.
- Philip was wrong.

112
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,770
I don't deserve forgiveness.
I'm not worthy of it.

113
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:06,839
The dreams are back.

114
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:08,909
They never stopped.

115
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,980
They're always there.

116
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,948
Staring at me.

117
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,052
The people you wronged?

118
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:22,089
- Reverend.
- Philip was the reverend.

119
00:11:23,157 --> 00:11:25,292
Do you trust me,

120
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:27,895
that I know
what I'm talking about?

121
00:11:27,928 --> 00:11:30,030
I have known
my share of men.

122
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,066
Kind, evil,
everything in between.

123
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,970
You are a good man
and a good preacher.

124
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,273
Just hang on.

125
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:55,856
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

126
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:03,096
Uncle Philip, I'm sorry.

127
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:07,901
I know I'm not supposed
to come here, but I need help.

128
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,504
And I... And I am
in really big trouble.

129
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:12,339
Okay. Okay.
Slow down. Slow down.

130
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:14,074
I'm... I'm not Philip.

131
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:18,811
Am I in the right place?

132
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,136
Your uncle died
almost a year ago.

133
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,838
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stay with me, stay with me.

134
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,811
Well, what's...
What's your name?

135
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,047
Tabitha.

136
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:57,184
Well, welcome.
What kind of trouble are you in?

137
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,854
I don't wanna talk
about that.

138
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:04,157
I... I don't ever
wanna talk about it.

139
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,295
Philip said that
if I needed help,

140
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,896
that I could come here.

141
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,098
I...

142
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:16,036
I can drive you
to the emergency room.

143
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,308
Forget it.

144
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,013
Wait.

145
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,952
Just wait.

146
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:47,567
So Peter got out of the boat,
and he walked on the water.

147
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:50,437
He saw the winds approaching,

148
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,306
and he became afraid.

149
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,309
And he took his eyes off of
Jesus, and he began to sink.

150
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:59,446
And he cried out to the Lord,
saying, "Lord, save me!"

151
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,847
And Jesus reached out his hand.

152
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:05,452
When life is a tumultuous storm,

153
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:09,056
look to him
and keep looking to him.

154
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:13,193
And now our very own
adopted daughter Tabitha

155
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:15,128
wants to inspire us
with something

156
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:16,963
she's been working very hard on.

157
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:18,865
Let's give her a hand.

158
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:49,930
<i>♪ Rock of Ages, cleft for me ♪</i>

159
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:54,267
<i>♪ Let me hide myself in thee ♪</i>

160
00:14:54,301 --> 00:15:00,674
<i>♪ Let the water
And the blood ♪</i>

161
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:05,512
<i>♪ From the wounded side
That flows ♪</i>

162
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:11,651
<i>♪ Be of sin the double cure ♪</i>

163
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:18,892
<i>♪ Save from wrath
And make me pure ♪</i>

164
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:23,296
Thanks, Bobby. Appreciate it.

165
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,465
Hey, thank you very much.
Thank you.

166
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:27,067
Oh, thank you.

167
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,669
Tom. Hey.

168
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:32,005
- Hey.
- Hey, how's your grandmother? I...

169
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:35,142
Does she need anything?
I haven't been over there in a few weeks.

170
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:38,278
Oh, no, she actually moved to
assisted living, in Valencia.

171
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:41,214
Oh. Well, you got
the whole place to yourself.

172
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:44,151
- Yeah.
- Can you afford that? Is it okay?

173
00:15:45,185 --> 00:15:46,586
Yeah,
I'm doing all right.

174
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,655
- Good.
- Yeah.

175
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:50,690
It was a really good
sermon today.

176
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,559
They've been
really good lately.

177
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:54,561
- Really? Lately?
- Yeah.

178
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:56,530
What's this about?

179
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:00,567
Oh, this?
Oh, just a rough night.

180
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,035
I really wasn't
paying attention.

181
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:03,703
Nice job, Reverend.

182
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:06,373
Ah. You too, chipmunk.
Proud of you.

183
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:10,076
Wow. Hope you gave
as good as you got.

184
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,547
Oh, no. It wasn't like that.

185
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,081
What was it like?

186
00:16:18,418 --> 00:16:19,719
I... I don't know.

187
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:22,722
Ah... Hey, but I...
I gotta go.

188
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:24,357
Hey, wait.
How'd that video turn out?

189
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,660
Oh.

190
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,429
Um... Yeah, yeah.
It turned out really good.

191
00:16:29,463 --> 00:16:31,498
Um... You're really talented.

192
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,233
You... You wanna see?

193
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:35,502
Here...

194
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,572
is my number.

195
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,373
Send it to me.

196
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:42,542
Okay. Thanks.

197
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,479
Listen, I really gotta go.

198
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,780
I'll see you next week.

199
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:48,315
All right. Bye.

200
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,288
Don't tease him.
You know he likes you.

201
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,491
I'm not gonna ask him out.
Those are the rules.

202
00:16:57,524 --> 00:16:59,493
Oh.

203
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,071
What's wrong?

204
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,074
Nothing.

205
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,978
Nothing's wrong.

206
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:20,547
Nothing's wrong.

207
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,384
Nothing's wrong.

208
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:16,069
Hands! Show me your hands!

209
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,484
All right.

210
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:35,088
Uh-huh.

211
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:38,725
- Pizza!
- Ooh, yay!

212
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:41,896
Did I tell you
how proud I am of you?

213
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,265
Only, like, 20 times.

214
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,200
Okay.

215
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,269
Tell us something about yourself
that would shock us

216
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,471
or move back four spaces.

217
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:55,342
Mmm. We do not have
that kind of time.

218
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,845
- Miss Abigail!
- Don't you know who you're talking to?

219
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:01,214
I was a singer
in the '70s.

220
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,617
I toured with all the greats.

221
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,818
I was hot stuff.

222
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,487
Waist like this,
skirts up to here.

223
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,222
Oh, forgive me, Lord.

224
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:11,358
You know, they
called me Baby Thunder.

225
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:14,394
Oh, whoa! Too much information!
Too much!

226
00:19:15,428 --> 00:19:16,630
Oh.

227
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:19,900
- Huh.
- Wait, is that...

228
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:22,569
It's got some weight to it.
Might be the one.

229
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:25,505
Okay, open it.

230
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:27,273
No, don't open it.

231
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,577
Just do it.

232
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:42,255
Hey! What is this?

233
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:09,282
There you are,
my little dreamer.

234
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:11,484
I missed you.

235
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:14,721
You were the most loved.

236
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:17,892
- Above all the others.
- Get out of here right now!

237
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,726
- Hey, back up!
- I'm sorry. I didn't know!

238
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:23,196
You tore out my heart
when you left.

239
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,667
But I knew the universe
would bring you back.

240
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:33,206
We're bound, you and I.

241
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:35,642
Don't touch me.

242
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:42,449
You're confused.
You're in pain. I see that.

243
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:44,350
I taught you what freedom
was, true freedom.

244
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:48,722
And it scared you.
That's natural.

245
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:50,523
I thought you were ready,

246
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:53,460
but I pushed you
too hard, too fast.

247
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:56,396
The unprepared mind
will do anything

248
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,465
to come back to this prison,

249
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:02,469
with its rules and comforts.

250
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,637
- That's enough. Don't say one more word!
- Don't try me.

251
00:21:10,077 --> 00:21:11,845
Do you remember that night?

252
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:15,849
When all was in balance.

253
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:20,787
Underneath all those stars.

254
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,458
You pledged yourself to me.

255
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,763
The ritual night
is upon us again.

256
00:21:29,796 --> 00:21:35,802
I pledged to be your guide,
and I will, my child.

257
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:38,404
We must finish
what we started.

258
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:39,907
She's not going with you.

259
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,943
I don't care
how many guns you have.

260
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:46,279
You will do nothing but offer
poisoned words to enslaved minds.

261
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:48,782
Shame on you.

262
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,416
Tabitha, no.

263
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:52,920
It's time to go.

264
00:21:52,953 --> 00:21:56,790
- No, no.
- You are in God's house!

265
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,691
You leave that child alone.

266
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:02,796
No!

267
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:05,799
What, preacher, what?
What are you gonna do?

268
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:13,339
If you make me
drag you out of here,

269
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,775
it'll be so much worse.

270
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,744
Come.

271
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:21,648
Come.

272
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:32,325
We're done here.

273
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:37,131
- Let me go!
- Don't give me any trouble.

274
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,464
Tabitha?

275
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,868
Tabitha?

276
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:43,670
Tabitha!

277
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,739
You won't get away with this!

278
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,479
I'm calling about Abigail.

279
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,957
No, I'll... I'll tell them.

280
00:23:05,993 --> 00:23:08,761
Yes. Send it to me.

281
00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:13,533
I'll pay for the funeral.

282
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,636
I'm so sorry.

283
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:18,371
I'm sorry.

284
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:22,542
Talk.

285
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,612
I'm so sorry.

286
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,517
Abigail's dead.

287
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:34,989
What?

288
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,924
Who were they?

289
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:41,394
No, no, no.

290
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:43,864
Who were they?

291
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:45,665
- Talk.
- It's Erik!

292
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:49,836
I...
He was the one who hit her.

293
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,505
Look, I just met him
at work last month.

294
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:55,408
We started talking.

295
00:23:56,743 --> 00:24:00,080
I just needed some rent.
I just drove a truck.

296
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:03,449
I didn't ask...
I didn't ask what for.

297
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:07,453
So I just asked him
for some advice about girls.

298
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:10,958
You know, I showed him
the video of Tabitha.

299
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,493
I guess he knew her.

300
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,798
And they threw me in the truck.
I don't know.

301
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:20,100
- What else?
- What?

302
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:22,535
What else?
What else do you know?

303
00:24:22,568 --> 00:24:24,104
Nothing. I don't...

304
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:28,441
He just... He had
a tattoo on his arm.

305
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:29,709
A spider.

306
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,547
I'm sorry!

307
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,972
<i>Mr. Beckman.</i>

308
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:02,076
<i>Welcome back. Or should I
call you "reverend" now?</i>

309
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,743
Just Beckman.

310
00:25:03,776 --> 00:25:05,578
<i>As you wish.</i>

311
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:07,547
<i>What can we do for you?</i>

312
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,516
I need an address.

313
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,987
And weapons.

314
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,554
<i>Mr. Beckman,</i>

315
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:16,857
<i>you remember the rules,
the price?</i>

316
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,995
I'll pay it.

317
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:22,528
<i>Very well.</i>

318
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,031
<i>Whenever you're ready.</i>

319
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:27,667
His name is Erik.

320
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,538
Five foot ten,
black hair, spider tattoo.

321
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,577
Hands!

322
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,645
Show me your hands!

323
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,086
Hands.

324
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:51,058
Where is Erik?

325
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,894
Where's Erik?

326
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:57,865
You.

327
00:25:58,332 --> 00:25:59,900
Where is she?

328
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,635
Man, you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.

329
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:10,077
Go back home
before you get hurt.

330
00:26:13,347 --> 00:26:14,714
Last chance.

331
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,852
Where is she?

332
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,033
Help.

333
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:43,203
Help me.

334
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,196
<i>911,
what's the nature of your emergency?</i>

335
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:11,064
<i>Hello?</i>

336
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:14,800
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

337
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,804
<i>Okay, I have your location.
I'm sending out a unit.</i>

338
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:48,502
<i>You've reached a number</i>

339
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,770
<i>that has been disconnected
or no longer...</i>

340
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:57,511
<i>Hello?</i>

341
00:28:57,544 --> 00:28:58,844
Listen to me.

342
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,382
I think we were followed.

343
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:05,219
We need to move Tabitha
right away.

344
00:29:05,252 --> 00:29:07,387
<i>- Where is she?
- What?</i>

345
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:11,091
<i>I haven't seen her in over a year.
I'm sleeping.</i>

346
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,259
Who is this?

347
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:36,016
My love.

348
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:41,255
I'm sorry,
but he said it's urgent.

349
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:42,923
Something about Tabitha?

350
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,527
All your life
the world insists

351
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:51,231
you punish yourself
for being inconvenient.

352
00:29:52,532 --> 00:29:56,370
You never need
to apologize to me.

353
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,038
Okay.

354
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:09,349
Erik, I hope you have some idea
how disruptive this phone call is.

355
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:15,788
Erik won't be having
any more ideas.

356
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,559
The preacher.

357
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:21,028
Pay close attention.

358
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,830
My name is Aaron Beckman.

359
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,433
You ask around about me.

360
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,568
And when you find out who I am,

361
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:31,204
<i>you're gonna
let Tabitha go unharmed.</i>

362
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:36,043
It's your only chance
to survive what's coming.

363
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:38,912
Your actions, your threats,
they mean nothing to me.

364
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:42,316
My future will be
as it was revealed to me.

365
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,551
As it always has been.

366
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,286
Solid like iron.

367
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,356
Unchanging.

368
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:53,193
<i>You will fail.</i>

369
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,930
You always fail.

370
00:30:56,963 --> 00:31:00,000
Let her go, now.

371
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:03,036
It's impossible.

372
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,873
<i>That one's journey has ended
as it was meant to.</i>

373
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,943
The desert drank her water.

374
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,147
And she has returned
to the void.

375
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,188
I'll see you soon.

376
00:31:43,176 --> 00:31:45,979
<i>- No, I can't.
- Just hang on.</i>

377
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:48,515
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

378
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:50,550
I can't do it.

379
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:52,919
You can do it.

380
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:57,424
Just a few more hours.
Hang on. You can do it.

381
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:03,497
Help!

382
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:06,299
<i>Reverend?</i>

383
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,437
I think
I'm feeling better.

384
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:15,909
Do you think I could
get some breakfast?

385
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:23,383
Sure. Yeah, come on in.

386
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:31,258
I... Yeah, here.

387
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:39,232
How... How do you like
your eggs?

388
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:41,501
I don't care.

389
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:57,217
Why are you doing this for me?

390
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:02,456
<i>Why'd you take me in?</i>

391
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:04,658
<i>I had my personal reasons.</i>

392
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,560
<i>That's between me and God.</i>

393
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,161
<i>And open.</i>

394
00:33:09,596 --> 00:33:13,467
Oh! Is that mine?

395
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,369
- As soon as you pass the test.
- I love it.

396
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:20,474
- How'd you afford this?
- Well, you earned it.

397
00:33:20,507 --> 00:33:22,042
We're very proud of you.

398
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:24,244
Uh, I got something else.

399
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,551
It's not exactly the one
that you wanted, but close.

400
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:35,655
No, it... it's great.
It's really great. Thank you.

401
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:40,026
And not brand-new,
but it's yours.

402
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,069
I can... I can pay you back.

403
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,540
No, no, you don't...
you don't have to pay me back.

404
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,377
Nothing...
Nothing's ever free.

405
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,515
I don't mean to be ungrateful.
It's just...

406
00:34:01,548 --> 00:34:04,217
No, it's okay. I get it.

407
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,620
This is new for both of us.

408
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:08,154
You being a daughter...

409
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,257
me a dad.

410
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,093
- It's weird, right?
- Yeah.

411
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:16,029
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing.

412
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:20,433
But I promise you...

413
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:26,506
I'll never, never hurt you.

414
00:34:27,574 --> 00:34:29,409
And I'll always protect you.

415
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,080
I've heard that before,
you know.

416
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,551
And I...
I wanna believe you.

417
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:39,653
I just... I need time.

418
00:34:50,764 --> 00:34:55,435
"Dear Tabitha, it's been my great honor to
inform you that you've been acc... accepted.

419
00:34:57,872 --> 00:34:59,172
Admission..."

420
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,354
<i>Mr. Beckman.
Were you satisfied with your service?</i>

421
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:17,257
<i>- Yes.
- Excellent.</i>

422
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,593
<i>You now have one week
to repay your debt</i>

423
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:20,861
<i>to The Network.</i>

424
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:22,529
<i>Keep the phone charged.</i>

425
00:35:22,562 --> 00:35:26,633
<i>When it rings, answer
and do exactly as instructed.</i>

426
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,635
I know.

427
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,171
<i>Is there any other service
we could provide...</i>

428
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:34,140
No. No, nothing at all.

429
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,594
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, sir.</i>

430
00:35:55,795 --> 00:35:57,530
I'm Fred Shapiro
with the post office.

431
00:36:02,435 --> 00:36:04,204
You have a package here
that was damaged.

432
00:36:04,237 --> 00:36:06,272
The only thing I can read
is a phone number.

433
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:09,877
Uh, address starts
with a 2-6.

434
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,444
<i>Oh, no, it's 1-9.</i>

435
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:13,246
Oh, wow. Yeah.
Not even close.

436
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:17,584
Yeah, if you can give me the correct address,
we'll have this out to you tomorrow morning.

437
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:22,622
<i>Uh... Oh, sure. It's 1975 Comstock
Drive, Glendora, 91741.</i>

438
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:27,761
<i>Hey, I'm not expecting
a package. Who's it from?</i>

439
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:30,363
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

440
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:34,167
Hello? Do I know you?

441
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:36,436
Inside.

442
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:38,538
Okay.

443
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:44,210
You... You can take
whatever you want.

444
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,379
We got money.
There's a safe.

445
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:49,382
- Who else is here?
- No one.

446
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,718
Is someone at the door?

447
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,722
Call her.

448
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:00,694
Honey, will you come out
to the front room by the door?

449
00:37:00,727 --> 00:37:02,429
One sec.

450
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:06,299
Janice, where's my shovel?

451
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:10,470
Who else is here?

452
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:12,572
It's my brother-in-law Kirk.

453
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,541
- Sit down.
- Okay.

454
00:37:22,016 --> 00:37:24,350
Janice, what is happening?

455
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:27,320
It's a misunderstanding.
Just do what he says.

456
00:37:27,353 --> 00:37:29,723
Both of you, sit down.

457
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:32,592
- Hands on the table.
- They're not involved in this.

458
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,593
Sit!

459
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:40,400
You think this
is the first time

460
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,635
someone pointed a gun at me?

461
00:37:42,669 --> 00:37:43,636
Just sit.

462
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:52,545
That doesn't belong to you.

463
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:55,615
What? What is he talking about?
Who is he?

464
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,550
Just shut up!

465
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:15,870
- Is she dead?
- Don't tell him anything.

466
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:17,771
I don't know.

467
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:19,305
Where did you take her?

468
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,942
I don't know where she is.

469
00:38:21,976 --> 00:38:23,843
What is happening?
What is going on?

470
00:38:23,878 --> 00:38:26,379
Where is she?

471
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:29,783
I... don't... know.

472
00:38:29,816 --> 00:38:31,551
Raise your right hand.

473
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,321
Raise your hand.

474
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,558
Kirk.

475
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:42,395
What?

476
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:46,800
Don't run. Don't shout.

477
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,903
- Sit down.
- Okay, okay.

478
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,671
Mister, we have children.

479
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,606
Please.

480
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,577
Where is she?

481
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,047
- You're insane.
- Where is she?

482
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,681
I don't know.

483
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,117
Raise your left hand.

484
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,418
What?
No. No, no, no, no.

485
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:07,453
No, no, no.
What is happening?

486
00:39:07,922 --> 00:39:09,422
Raise your hand.

487
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:10,858
Okay.

488
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:16,030
Reese took her. Frank drove them.
That's all I know.

489
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:17,497
Where is this Reese?

490
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,732
- I don't know!
- Then where is Frank?

491
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:21,668
He'll kill me.

492
00:39:22,937 --> 00:39:24,838
Erik is dead
and his whole crew.

493
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:27,607
Now, I'm here.

494
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,677
There's only one way
you survive this.

495
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:00,875
This has to be a mistake.

496
00:40:00,908 --> 00:40:01,841
Say something.

497
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,744
Sweetie? Answer me!

498
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:08,781
Look, can you just let me out?
I'm not a part of this.

499
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:11,852
I don't even know what this is. I
promise, I won't say anything to anybody.

500
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:13,921
Shut up!

501
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,030
Mister, we have a 12-year-old son.
His name's Edward.

502
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:27,800
He's at school right now, and I'm supposed
to pick him up. And... he's anxious.

503
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:30,503
Tabitha was 17.

504
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:32,172
My daughter.

505
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:33,573
What?

506
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:36,709
What have you gotten me into?
I'm your husband. I deserve to know!

507
00:40:36,743 --> 00:40:38,879
Shut up, Dan!
Will you just shut up?

508
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,048
Janice, look out!

509
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,824
Give me your...

510
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:17,744
<i>- There's no way out.
- What's your name?</i>

511
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:19,779
<i>Tabitha.
I am in really big trouble.</i>

512
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:21,781
<i>Man, you don't know what
you're getting yourself into.</i>

513
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:23,616
<i>Under all those stars.</i>

514
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,756
Where is it?

515
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:32,292
Hey. You don't wanna
be late your first day.

516
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:34,794
My necklace, can you
help me find it? Please.

517
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,662
Uh... Okay.

518
00:42:38,232 --> 00:42:40,800
- What about...
- No, no, my necklace.

519
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:44,537
The blue one, right?
The one your mom gave you?

520
00:42:46,706 --> 00:42:48,308
I already
looked over there.

521
00:42:48,342 --> 00:42:49,675
Okay.

522
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,819
Could you please just move?
Please, please, just move.

523
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:02,189
- What?
- Please move. Please.

524
00:43:02,222 --> 00:43:04,690
Please, just get out of the way.
Get out of the way! Stop!

525
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,093
Okay, okay.

526
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:08,795
Hey.

527
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,600
You wanna talk about it?

528
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,737
<i>- Why'd you take me in?
- Why are you doing this for me?</i>

529
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,874
I already told you, I don't
ever wanna talk about it.

530
00:43:20,908 --> 00:43:22,642
<i>We're bound, you and I.</i>

531
00:43:24,844 --> 00:43:27,647
When will this feeling go away?
I just wanna tear it out.

532
00:43:31,852 --> 00:43:33,887
<i>- We're done here.
- Let me go!</i>

533
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:36,223
<i>Tabitha?
You won't get away with this!</i>

534
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:39,893
<i>You always fail.</i>

535
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,105
Don't make any noise.

536
00:44:26,473 --> 00:44:29,143
No one's gonna hear you
except for her.

537
00:44:29,176 --> 00:44:31,245
- Janice?
- I don't know her name.

538
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:34,780
Sometimes her brother
comes down.

539
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:37,750
But she's much worse.

540
00:44:40,154 --> 00:44:41,188
Hey.

541
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,661
It took me two days.

542
00:44:49,296 --> 00:44:50,931
What's your name?

543
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:53,867
Wendy.

544
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:55,269
Beckman.

545
00:45:00,474 --> 00:45:01,774
Quiet.

546
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:24,231
Frank is coming with Reese.

547
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:28,302
He's instructed me to keep
you here and not kill you.

548
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,008
He didn't say anything
about hurting you.

549
00:45:39,513 --> 00:45:41,248
I'm gonna hurt you now.

550
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:44,717
For my husband.

551
00:45:45,818 --> 00:45:47,820
For my children!

552
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,991
For my brother.

553
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:55,462
He protected me.

554
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:57,130
He was the only one
who knew me.

555
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,300
Hey!

556
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,738
Keys! Get the keys!

557
00:46:06,974 --> 00:46:07,840
I can't.

558
00:46:07,874 --> 00:46:09,809
I can't.

559
00:46:09,842 --> 00:46:11,878
I think I can get them.

560
00:46:19,186 --> 00:46:21,221
I'm gonna be there
when Reese takes you apart

561
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:23,156
piece by piece.

562
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,993
I'm gonna watch.

563
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:41,174
Keys. Grab the keys.

564
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:43,176
Keys.

565
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,424
Is she dead?

566
00:46:57,457 --> 00:46:59,792
Get my handcuffs. Quick.

567
00:47:08,602 --> 00:47:10,437
- What now?
- Help her.

568
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,205
Don't come up till I say.

569
00:48:01,455 --> 00:48:03,090
Come on, come on.

570
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:19,873
Come on, come on.

571
00:48:22,476 --> 00:48:23,443
No.

572
00:48:28,014 --> 00:48:30,083
No!

573
00:48:42,162 --> 00:48:45,031
<i>- What?
- We are not enemies, Mr. Beckman.</i>

574
00:48:45,065 --> 00:48:47,901
I have no enemies.

575
00:48:49,136 --> 00:48:50,904
All I have is love to give.

576
00:48:52,272 --> 00:48:54,674
By fighting, all you've done
is deprive yourself

577
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:57,344
of a very special journey.

578
00:48:58,612 --> 00:49:01,448
<i>The ritual night is upon us.</i>

579
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:05,552
- My students have gathered to witness the true...
- Shut up.

580
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:07,954
<i>Nothing's
gonna save you now.</i>

581
00:49:08,722 --> 00:49:11,925
Not words, not money, not guns.

582
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:15,529
You are a dead man.

583
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,232
All you care about
is the mortal flesh.

584
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,437
Life is so much more
than this, Mr. Beckman.

585
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:28,241
I only wish I could have
shown you my paradise.

586
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:34,514
Very well. If death is all
you understand, all you value...

587
00:49:36,216 --> 00:49:38,518
then I will
rain it down upon you

588
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:41,154
<i>and everyone around you.</i>

589
00:49:47,394 --> 00:49:49,062
Give it to me.

590
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:51,331
You need to get out of town
until this is all sorted out.

591
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:52,999
The ritual
will not be postponed.

592
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,534
You're not listening!

593
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:56,369
You can play
cult leader anywhere.

594
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:59,773
Just get on your jet and go.
This guy is serious.

595
00:49:59,806 --> 00:50:03,176
He's a real psychopath.
I looked into it.

596
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,045
The Koreans, you know
what they call him?

597
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:07,180
<i>Agma. The demon.</i>

598
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,222
You understand the price?

599
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:29,236
It's all clear.
You can come up now.

600
00:50:36,543 --> 00:50:38,211
Mister, is she dead?

601
00:50:38,845 --> 00:50:40,280
Did I kill her?

602
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:42,482
Keys.

603
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:50,290
Give me five minutes.

604
00:50:50,323 --> 00:50:51,791
Then call 911.

605
00:50:51,825 --> 00:50:53,393
What do I tell them?

606
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,228
The truth.

607
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,120
<i>Tom's phone. Leave a message.</i>

608
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:23,557
Tom! You have to
get out of the apartment.

609
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:26,426
Go to a safe place, somewhere where
no one will think to find you.

610
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,529
Don't answer the phone for anybody but me.

611
00:51:29,563 --> 00:51:31,197
I'm on my way.

612
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:01,161
Tom?

613
00:52:04,598 --> 00:52:05,565
Tom?

614
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,518
Connor.

615
00:52:59,586 --> 00:53:00,553
Isabel.

616
00:53:01,488 --> 00:53:02,589
Beckman.

617
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:13,366
You don't
look so good, Beckman.

618
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:18,471
Come on, man.
You think we're amateurs?

619
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:20,975
What do you say?

620
00:53:21,008 --> 00:53:23,410
Love you, Papa Bear.

621
00:53:23,443 --> 00:53:25,178
Love you, Mama Bear.

622
00:53:28,648 --> 00:53:29,582
Clear.

623
00:53:31,919 --> 00:53:33,219
Hey, Beckman.

624
00:53:34,654 --> 00:53:38,993
Word is that you got out,
found religion.

625
00:53:39,026 --> 00:53:40,460
Not going so well, is it?

626
00:53:43,697 --> 00:53:45,198
Clear.

627
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:48,702
It's good to see you, Aaron.

628
00:53:48,735 --> 00:53:50,336
Sorry it has to go like this.

629
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,673
A hundred thousand will get us
out of a tight spot. Clear.

630
00:53:56,944 --> 00:53:58,278
Clear.

631
00:54:01,815 --> 00:54:02,749
Window.

632
00:54:13,994 --> 00:54:15,829
Isabel! Isabel!

633
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,765
Isabel!

634
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:22,569
Isabel!

635
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,341
Isabel!

636
00:55:40,014 --> 00:55:41,548
Reverend?

637
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,387
What's happening?

638
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,691
Wait, Tom!

639
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:53,726
Tom!

640
00:56:10,643 --> 00:56:11,611
Wait!

641
00:56:15,149 --> 00:56:17,417
Tom, stop!
You're in trouble.

642
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:19,686
He was there to kill you.

643
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,989
- What? Why? I didn't do anything!
- I know.

644
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:23,590
Trust me on this.

645
00:56:23,623 --> 00:56:25,625
If you stay here,
you're dead.

646
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:41,608
- It's all my fault.
- It's not your fault.

647
00:56:41,641 --> 00:56:43,944
None of this is your fault.

648
00:56:43,978 --> 00:56:46,947
Well, what if he was lying?
What if she's not dead?

649
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:49,782
- She's gone.
- How do you know?

650
00:56:49,816 --> 00:56:52,785
I need you to focus.
Worry about your own skin.

651
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:57,892
- Well, where are we going?
- There's this guy I know. Owes me a favor.

652
00:56:57,925 --> 00:57:01,527
You're not gonna like it, but it'll
keep you safe until I can fix this.

653
00:57:01,561 --> 00:57:02,997
How?

654
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,765
Only way to erase a bounty is
to bury the man who posted it.

655
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:08,668
Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay.
I can't... I can't hear that.

656
00:57:09,669 --> 00:57:10,938
You're talking about murder.

657
00:57:12,172 --> 00:57:14,141
Reverend, you shot that guy.

658
00:57:14,174 --> 00:57:16,576
- He knew the risk.
- What?

659
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:19,046
You're a man of God.
You killed that guy.

660
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:20,948
I didn't have a choice.

661
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:22,649
<i>I got no choice!</i>

662
00:57:28,989 --> 00:57:31,457
- Please, we can go to the cops.
- The cops can't help.

663
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:32,792
- Please.
- The cops can't help you.

664
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:35,129
You're in it now.
Do you understand?

665
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:36,562
You're marked.

666
00:57:36,596 --> 00:57:38,631
What am... What am I in?

667
00:57:45,272 --> 00:57:47,041
The life. The other world.

668
00:57:47,074 --> 00:57:48,808
The underworld.
You're in it now.

669
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:53,613
Real killers, thieves,
darkness, evil.

670
00:57:54,614 --> 00:57:56,250
Listen.
You haven't spilled blood.

671
00:57:56,283 --> 00:57:57,885
You haven't taken money.

672
00:57:57,918 --> 00:58:02,856
You can still get out
if you do exactly what I say.

673
00:58:08,095 --> 00:58:10,530
What is it?
Who is that?

674
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:19,106
They call him The Administrator.

675
00:58:19,139 --> 00:58:20,707
What does that mean?

676
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,742
No one's lived long enough
to ask him.

677
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,644
Oh, pshh.

678
00:58:26,746 --> 00:58:29,249
Okay, well, we can go to the police.
They'll protect us.

679
00:58:29,283 --> 00:58:30,616
It's not gonna happen.

680
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:36,256
Okay, well, let's go, go, go!
We can lose him!

681
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,591
Only idiots
get into car chases.

682
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,295
- You work around here, right?
- Yeah.

683
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:44,098
- The... The brewery up on Battery Street.
- Okay.

684
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:53,606
- Where?
- To the right.

685
00:58:55,775 --> 00:58:57,744
Here. Unscrew the suppressor.

686
00:58:57,777 --> 00:59:00,847
- What? Is this loaded?
- This, unscrew it.

687
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,785
- Where?
- It's up here on the right.

688
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:09,156
- Get the keys?
- Yeah.

689
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:10,891
When I say go,
you get out fast.

690
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:12,658
Unlock the door.
I'll be right behind you.

691
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:18,798
Go!

692
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,020
Do not
disappoint me, Mr. Beckman.

693
01:00:15,755 --> 01:00:17,024
Do you have more ammo...

694
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:19,893
or a second firearm?

695
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:24,730
Very good.

696
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:26,967
I've always hoped

697
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,769
we'd have a chance
to test each other.

698
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,749
You were injured
before we started.

699
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:26,719
So this was not
a fair contest.

700
01:02:28,255 --> 01:02:29,856
Hard day.

701
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:40,133
You were out.

702
01:02:41,268 --> 01:02:42,835
And now you're back

703
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:45,838
with a considerable price
on your head.

704
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:47,975
You must have a good reason.

705
01:02:48,008 --> 01:02:49,276
Yeah.

706
01:02:50,444 --> 01:02:53,846
Before I complete
every assignment,

707
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,116
I ask this question.

708
01:02:56,149 --> 01:02:59,886
If I let you live,
what will you do?

709
01:03:02,022 --> 01:03:04,757
<i>What will you do, Mr. Beckman?</i>

710
01:03:08,528 --> 01:03:10,197
There were four of them.

711
01:03:11,098 --> 01:03:13,000
Traffickers.

712
01:03:13,033 --> 01:03:17,204
Came into my house,
killed my daughter.

713
01:03:18,972 --> 01:03:22,175
All she did was escape them.
That was her sin.

714
01:03:23,143 --> 01:03:27,314
She had just been
accepted to college.

715
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:31,118
She was starting a life.

716
01:03:32,919 --> 01:03:36,189
There were four of them.
Now there's only two.

717
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:42,329
I'm gonna finish what I started.
That's what I'm gonna do.

718
01:03:49,569 --> 01:03:52,873
I have killed 436 people...

719
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,809
and I spared only four.

720
01:03:58,178 --> 01:04:00,881
I believe that
because of my actions,

721
01:04:00,914 --> 01:04:03,984
the world is a better place.

722
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:07,087
You...

723
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:10,891
will be number five.

724
01:04:12,926 --> 01:04:16,396
Mercy is a rare
and powerful tool.

725
01:04:17,364 --> 01:04:19,066
I believe

726
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:22,569
the world will be a better place

727
01:04:22,602 --> 01:04:24,371
with you alive.

728
01:04:27,974 --> 01:04:29,876
But if I see your name

729
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,844
on the boards again,
Mr. Beckman,

730
01:04:32,512 --> 01:04:34,314
you will have no mercy.

731
01:04:36,083 --> 01:04:38,852
You will not
even see me coming.

732
01:05:06,213 --> 01:05:09,149
Favors, all these favors.

733
01:05:09,182 --> 01:05:12,252
I'm running
a business here, Beckman.

734
01:05:12,285 --> 01:05:16,223
- You're positive no one followed you here?
- No one followed me.

735
01:05:16,256 --> 01:05:19,526
Yeah, every two-bit banger
with a gun is gonna be

736
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:21,461
after that hundred grand.

737
01:05:21,495 --> 01:05:24,231
I'm tempted to shoot you myself.

738
01:05:24,264 --> 01:05:28,535
And I don't need the money.
You know that, right?

739
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:31,505
I run all this on favors.

740
01:05:31,538 --> 01:05:35,075
No, no. Just kidding here.

741
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:37,344
- What is this?
- Huh?

742
01:05:38,078 --> 01:05:39,446
- What?
- What is this?

743
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:42,082
What is this? Oh, sweet.

744
01:05:42,115 --> 01:05:45,085
He don't know.

745
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:47,287
Look, I just need you
to hold him for a few days.

746
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,257
Days. You sure you want
days with this kid?

747
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:52,459
Yeah, I'll give you
all the time in the world.

748
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:59,433
What? This is a prison.

749
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:03,303
You see? This is where you're
gonna spend the next five years.

750
01:06:03,336 --> 01:06:06,039
No, no, no.

751
01:06:06,072 --> 01:06:09,376
Look, do you wanna be safe
or you wanna be dead?

752
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:15,248
No one's gonna bother you in
there, my guarantee.

753
01:06:27,227 --> 01:06:29,095
Wait.

754
01:06:32,065 --> 01:06:33,433
I just wanna say something.

755
01:06:34,668 --> 01:06:36,369
To him.

756
01:06:43,076 --> 01:06:45,278
Killing those men
isn't gonna bring her back.

757
01:06:47,314 --> 01:06:49,382
- Go to the cops.
- I can't go to the cops.

758
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:51,485
- You can.
- Tom.

759
01:06:52,486 --> 01:06:53,420
This?

760
01:06:55,422 --> 01:06:56,456
This is because of you.

761
01:06:57,691 --> 01:06:59,593
This kid got in my face
at a party.

762
01:07:01,394 --> 01:07:03,163
I could have beat him.

763
01:07:04,698 --> 01:07:06,566
But I thought about
what you taught me.

764
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,170
"Blessed are the meek,
blessed are the merciful."

765
01:07:11,404 --> 01:07:12,572
I just let him hit me.

766
01:07:12,606 --> 01:07:14,407
And he kept hitting me until...

767
01:07:16,142 --> 01:07:18,411
I don't know, he just
kinda got freaked out.

768
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,681
But he came up to me later.

769
01:07:21,715 --> 01:07:24,284
He wanted to know
why I didn't fight back.

770
01:07:25,085 --> 01:07:26,620
So I told him.

771
01:07:28,154 --> 01:07:30,824
He told me he was sorry.

772
01:07:30,858 --> 01:07:33,159
He wanted to change
his whole life around.

773
01:07:35,195 --> 01:07:37,631
You helped that happen.

774
01:07:39,332 --> 01:07:41,668
When life is
a tumultuous storm...

775
01:07:41,701 --> 01:07:44,304
- I know what I said.
- So stop.

776
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:48,308
Remember who you are.

777
01:07:51,879 --> 01:07:53,380
Reverend!

778
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:55,582
Reverend!

779
01:07:58,685 --> 01:08:00,186
I need ammo. I'm out.

780
01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:03,557
Hey, look.
You know the rules.

781
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,293
I stay completely neutral.

782
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:08,361
This guy who wants
you dead so bad,

783
01:08:08,395 --> 01:08:11,164
you know how to get to him?

784
01:08:11,197 --> 01:08:14,401
- Not yet.
- You know my cousin's a broker downtown.

785
01:08:14,434 --> 01:08:18,505
Off The Network.
I could give you credit.

786
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:22,475
No. I know who I need
to talk to.

787
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:31,451
What?

788
01:08:31,484 --> 01:08:34,187
No. You got exactly
what you paid for.

789
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:35,589
You hired me
to crack the firewall.

790
01:08:35,622 --> 01:08:38,291
"I will take care of the rest."
Your exact words.

791
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:42,562
That's right, Mr. Kerrigan.
I record everything.

792
01:08:45,632 --> 01:08:49,235
I can't help that you're too
basic to get past the encryption.

793
01:08:50,804 --> 01:08:52,539
Oh, you wanna dance?
Let's dance.

794
01:08:52,572 --> 01:08:54,541
I've got your fingerprints,
I've got your DNA,

795
01:08:54,574 --> 01:08:56,242
I've got your socials,
pin numbers, transcripts.

796
01:08:56,276 --> 01:08:57,878
I will burn
your life down in minutes.

797
01:08:57,912 --> 01:09:00,113
You're just a tourist
in my world.

798
01:09:02,382 --> 01:09:03,316
Kara!

799
01:09:03,783 --> 01:09:05,585
I just wanna talk.

800
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,554
Wait!

801
01:09:09,823 --> 01:09:11,124
Wait!

802
01:09:32,612 --> 01:09:34,949
I'm just passing through.

803
01:09:34,982 --> 01:09:39,719
- Whatever this is, I'm here for...
- Kara.

804
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:44,491
Yeah.

805
01:09:44,524 --> 01:09:47,694
She's gonna pay us eight grand
to make sure you don't find her.

806
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:52,165
You gotta be kidding me.

807
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:57,170
I just wanna talk.

808
01:10:06,613 --> 01:10:08,615
Wait, that's the guy.

809
01:10:09,582 --> 01:10:11,718
I saw your picture
on the boards today.

810
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:15,622
Boys, he's worth
a hundred grand.

811
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:19,626
This is gonna be a good day.

812
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:22,729
It's a good day.
Let's get to work.

813
01:11:04,337 --> 01:11:05,805
The drill. Get the drill!

814
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:07,474
Yeah, yeah.

815
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:32,066
Hey, man,
it's just business, huh?

816
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:33,666
It's nothing personal.

817
01:11:42,742 --> 01:11:43,676
What?

818
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,280
Is he dead?

819
01:11:49,116 --> 01:11:50,885
Are you sure?

820
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:06,666
Gun.

821
01:12:10,938 --> 01:12:13,439
I just wanna talk.

822
01:12:21,548 --> 01:12:25,085
Lane must have hired you.
That was a setup. I...

823
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:26,719
I wasn't even there.

824
01:12:29,789 --> 01:12:32,458
I just need information.

825
01:12:34,061 --> 01:12:36,396
I wasn't even there.

826
01:12:36,429 --> 01:12:37,898
It's not about that.

827
01:12:42,036 --> 01:12:43,469
I don't wanna die.

828
01:12:43,503 --> 01:12:45,805
I'm not gonna shoot you.

829
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:49,576
I don't believe you.

830
01:12:50,144 --> 01:12:51,744
It's what you do.

831
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:54,614
It is.

832
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:04,691
I was out for three years.

833
01:13:06,894 --> 01:13:08,528
Hayes was right.

834
01:13:09,129 --> 01:13:11,165
We are what we are.

835
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:12,432
<i>Save yourself.</i>

836
01:13:12,465 --> 01:13:13,901
He was a good man.

837
01:13:15,903 --> 01:13:16,871
That was you?

838
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:27,081
So how is it on the surface?

839
01:13:27,114 --> 01:13:28,615
It's beautiful.

840
01:13:29,716 --> 01:13:32,186
You're not afraid,
not trapped.

841
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:35,923
You're just... free.

842
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:39,559
Free to believe.

843
01:13:41,061 --> 01:13:42,662
Care about someone.

844
01:13:44,064 --> 01:13:44,999
Must be nice.

845
01:13:46,066 --> 01:13:47,935
I had a daughter.

846
01:13:48,936 --> 01:13:50,670
They killed her.

847
01:13:51,537 --> 01:13:53,007
She was just 17.

848
01:13:56,843 --> 01:13:58,511
You would've liked her.

849
01:14:00,214 --> 01:14:03,583
For old times,
do me this one favor.

850
01:14:07,587 --> 01:14:09,555
Two more men need to die.

851
01:14:13,093 --> 01:14:14,694
They're the last.

852
01:14:16,964 --> 01:14:17,865
After that...

853
01:14:26,106 --> 01:14:27,707
What was her name?

854
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:39,219
<i>"Blessed are the merciful.</i>

855
01:14:39,253 --> 01:14:40,955
<i>Blessed are the peacekeepers."</i>

856
01:14:40,988 --> 01:14:43,157
<i>Are you ready to let it all go?</i>

857
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:45,758
<i>Why are you doing this for me?</i>

858
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:47,061
<i>Remember what you've learned.</i>

859
01:14:47,094 --> 01:14:48,929
Hey.

860
01:14:48,963 --> 01:14:50,530
Come on up.

861
01:14:51,265 --> 01:14:54,734
- You found them?
- Bad news first.

862
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:56,469
Your boogeyman,
Reese Saladurus.

863
01:14:57,204 --> 01:14:59,239
Real name
Paul Robert Kettle III,

864
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:01,075
heir to his daddy's
telecom fortune.

865
01:15:01,108 --> 01:15:03,243
He is worth billions.

866
01:15:03,277 --> 01:15:05,845
He was kicked out
of Dartmouth in '86.

867
01:15:05,879 --> 01:15:08,248
Reason redacted.
Police records redacted.

868
01:15:08,282 --> 01:15:10,117
He spent a few years
in the psych wards.

869
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:12,052
Hospital defunded.
Poof. He's gone.

870
01:15:15,322 --> 01:15:17,291
- Where is he now?
- I...

871
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:19,893
Off the grid.
There's no permanent address.

872
01:15:19,927 --> 01:15:21,929
Look, all I know is that
he pops up every now and then,

873
01:15:21,962 --> 01:15:23,663
he rents houses for cash
in the desert.

874
01:15:23,696 --> 01:15:25,598
He's there for a few weeks
and he's gone.

875
01:15:25,631 --> 01:15:27,234
That's all I know.

876
01:15:27,267 --> 01:15:31,005
If you want any more,
use the black phone and take your chances.

877
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:36,276
- Good news?
- Frank Keetus.

878
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:39,279
Known trafficker
and all-around giant dirtbag.

879
01:15:39,313 --> 01:15:41,015
He owns a fancy restaurant
in Malibu,

880
01:15:41,048 --> 01:15:43,917
- but it's a front for the business.
- Which is what?

881
01:15:43,951 --> 01:15:45,185
You know what it is.

882
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:47,955
You know I work with a lot of
hard-core, evil individuals,

883
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:50,858
but I won't touch
anything like that.

884
01:15:52,259 --> 01:15:53,961
Do me a favor.

885
01:15:57,064 --> 01:15:58,598
Kill him twice.

886
01:16:23,957 --> 01:16:25,993
Sir, you can't
park your car there.

887
01:16:27,161 --> 01:16:28,128
Sir!

888
01:16:31,098 --> 01:16:32,900
You Beckman?

889
01:16:32,933 --> 01:16:35,568
Boss said to break your arms
if you try to get in.

890
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:37,570
So?

891
01:16:38,405 --> 01:16:39,973
What do you wanna do?

892
01:16:40,706 --> 01:16:42,608
What do you wanna do?

893
01:16:54,421 --> 01:16:56,390
Hit end.

894
01:16:56,423 --> 01:16:57,723
Please.

895
01:16:59,026 --> 01:17:00,593
Take me to Frank.

896
01:17:01,128 --> 01:17:02,728
Leave the phone.

897
01:17:05,165 --> 01:17:08,102
I told you they would
be good this time, huh?

898
01:17:08,135 --> 01:17:09,136
The best yet.

899
01:17:20,314 --> 01:17:21,215
Who's this?

900
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:25,919
Who are you to invite
yourself to our table?

901
01:17:25,953 --> 01:17:28,956
This is private meeting.
Go away.

902
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:31,791
Meeting's over.

903
01:17:31,824 --> 01:17:34,261
Gentlemen,
my deepest apologies.

904
01:17:34,294 --> 01:17:36,864
You could follow Samara
to the bar, have a drink.

905
01:17:36,897 --> 01:17:40,800
In my business, I am the boss
and the complaint department.

906
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:43,971
Nothing to worry about.
This will just take a few minutes.

907
01:17:44,004 --> 01:17:45,873
- Do you think I should call the...
- No!

908
01:17:45,906 --> 01:17:48,242
Don't call the cops.
How stupid are you?

909
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:58,418
You don't look so hot,
preacher.

910
01:17:58,452 --> 01:18:00,988
Let's go in the back,
have a talk.

911
01:18:01,021 --> 01:18:03,157
- We could talk here.
- Get up.

912
01:18:05,225 --> 01:18:06,994
You're the guy with the gun.

913
01:18:39,825 --> 01:18:43,096
Oh, why don't we skip the part
where this shocks you.

914
01:18:44,097 --> 01:18:45,731
You're no civilian.

915
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,335
I know exactly what you are.

916
01:18:48,368 --> 01:18:49,970
You know what I want.

917
01:18:50,003 --> 01:18:52,940
- Where is he?
- Polecat Ranch.

918
01:18:52,973 --> 01:18:55,242
About ten miles
north of Piru.

919
01:18:55,275 --> 01:18:59,279
He's there right now running
one of his crazy rituals.

920
01:18:59,313 --> 01:19:01,949
You'd give him up that easy?

921
01:19:01,982 --> 01:19:05,919
- I don't buy it.
- You're in my place with a gun to my head.

922
01:19:05,953 --> 01:19:07,854
How do I need
this aggravation, huh?

923
01:19:07,888 --> 01:19:10,924
Over one dead kid? Nah.

924
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:13,493
You go up there, pop him in the head.
What do I care?

925
01:19:13,527 --> 01:19:15,862
He's crazy.
Money ain't worth this.

926
01:19:18,131 --> 01:19:20,200
You think this gets you
off the hook?

927
01:19:21,902 --> 01:19:23,270
You're part of it.

928
01:19:28,408 --> 01:19:30,077
You should probably answer that.

929
01:19:31,245 --> 01:19:32,179
Go on.

930
01:19:39,019 --> 01:19:42,189
<i>- Beckman.
- Good evening, Mr. Beckman.</i>

931
01:19:42,222 --> 01:19:45,959
<i>Are you prepared to fulfill
your debt to The Network?</i>

932
01:19:47,294 --> 01:19:49,930
<i>- Mr. Beckman?
- Yes.</i>

933
01:19:49,963 --> 01:19:53,066
<i>Excellent.
Listen carefully.</i>

934
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,336
<i>The contract on your life
has been suspended.</i>

935
01:19:56,370 --> 01:20:00,173
<i>To fulfill your debt,
you are to cease any and all</i>

936
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:03,143
<i>acts of retribution
towards Frank Keetus,</i>

937
01:20:03,176 --> 01:20:06,880
<i>his clients, employees
or known associates.</i>

938
01:20:06,913 --> 01:20:10,017
<i>Do you understand
what I've said?</i>

939
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:14,288
<i>Mr. Beckman, are you there?
Would you like me to repeat it?</i>

940
01:20:14,321 --> 01:20:16,490
<i>- I got it.
- Good.</i>

941
01:20:16,523 --> 01:20:18,558
<i>Do I need to remind you
of the price</i>

942
01:20:18,592 --> 01:20:21,428
<i>of defying a Network order?</i>

943
01:20:21,461 --> 01:20:25,565
<i>- No.
- Then the book is closed on this transaction.</i>

944
01:20:25,599 --> 01:20:27,301
<i>We hope to serve you again.</i>

945
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:32,439
You'll be lowering that gun now.

946
01:20:32,472 --> 01:20:33,407
Sit down.

947
01:20:35,976 --> 01:20:36,943
Hey.

948
01:20:37,878 --> 01:20:39,246
It's over.

949
01:20:41,081 --> 01:20:43,183
<i>Killing those men
isn't gonna bring her back.</i>

950
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:03,170
Hey.

951
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:05,038
Put the gun down.

952
01:21:07,607 --> 01:21:10,310
Hey, put the gun down.

953
01:21:17,651 --> 01:21:19,386
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

954
01:21:24,124 --> 01:21:26,360
<i>I'll always protect you.</i>

955
01:21:28,962 --> 01:21:31,031
Whoa. Hey, it's over!

956
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:36,103
What do you want?

957
01:21:36,136 --> 01:21:38,038
You want me to say I'm sorry?

958
01:21:38,071 --> 01:21:40,907
I am sorry the world's rotten.

959
01:21:40,941 --> 01:21:43,643
A stinking open sewer.
Not my fault!

960
01:21:43,677 --> 01:21:46,513
I didn't invent this game.

961
01:21:46,546 --> 01:21:49,082
I am not responsible
for all the evils of the world.

962
01:21:49,116 --> 01:21:51,651
Why don't you ask God
about that, preacher, huh?

963
01:21:51,685 --> 01:21:54,054
Who is responsible for
creating this whole mess?

964
01:21:55,188 --> 01:21:58,091
I didn't ask for this.
To be born into this.

965
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:00,660
No. I came up from nothing.

966
01:22:00,694 --> 01:22:03,130
I am just playing
the garbage hand I was dealt,

967
01:22:03,163 --> 01:22:05,932
trying to make a dollar
like everybody else!

968
01:22:05,966 --> 01:22:09,302
And you don't get to judge me,
the things you've done.

969
01:22:11,438 --> 01:22:15,142
Oh, come on! These girls,
they were never gonna make it.

970
01:22:15,175 --> 01:22:17,444
You know that.
Not one of 'em.

971
01:22:17,477 --> 01:22:20,213
Orphans, addicts, homeless.

972
01:22:20,247 --> 01:22:23,517
Now, we only sell
to the best select clients.

973
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:26,653
Millionaires, billionaires!

974
01:22:26,686 --> 01:22:28,221
We did these girls a favor!

975
01:22:32,993 --> 01:22:36,029
You can't do this.
You know you can't do this.

976
01:22:36,062 --> 01:22:38,331
Now, wait a minute.
Stop! Just stop!

977
01:24:48,863 --> 01:24:50,297
<i>You were out!</i>

978
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:52,332
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

979
01:24:53,533 --> 01:24:55,735
<i>You're a man of God.
You killed that guy!</i>

980
01:24:55,769 --> 01:24:56,938
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

981
01:24:56,971 --> 01:25:00,674
<i>Two more men
need to die. They're the last.</i>

982
01:25:00,707 --> 01:25:03,476
<i>- Save yourself.
- There's gotta be a way out.</i>

983
01:25:07,747 --> 01:25:09,082
You have to let go.

984
01:25:43,717 --> 01:25:46,353
A new cycle begins.

985
01:25:49,389 --> 01:25:52,158
The blood is set free
to pass through the flame

986
01:25:52,192 --> 01:25:55,362
and is transformed, purified.

987
01:25:55,395 --> 01:25:58,164
Where there was once
sickness and decay,

988
01:25:58,198 --> 01:26:00,935
there is now light,

989
01:26:00,968 --> 01:26:04,704
energy, purpose.

990
01:26:06,974 --> 01:26:09,376
The spirit passes
through the flame,

991
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:12,913
and it is transformed
and purified.

992
01:26:12,947 --> 01:26:16,650
Where there was once
confusion and suffering,

993
01:26:16,683 --> 01:26:18,953
there is now peace.

994
01:26:21,254 --> 01:26:24,892
The mind is set free
to pass through the flame,

995
01:26:24,925 --> 01:26:28,662
and it is transformed, purified.

996
01:26:41,441 --> 01:26:44,711
He's gonna hurt the teacher!
Stop him!

997
01:26:44,744 --> 01:26:46,546
No! No!

998
01:26:49,783 --> 01:26:51,418
Stand back!

999
01:26:51,451 --> 01:26:54,187
Stand back and have no fear.

1000
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:57,724
No fear.

1001
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:03,630
This man has come
with a very specific purpose.

1002
01:27:03,663 --> 01:27:05,465
Haven't you, preacher?

1003
01:27:10,303 --> 01:27:12,772
To transition me
into the flames.

1004
01:27:12,806 --> 01:27:19,279
To end my journey here
as Reese, your teacher.

1005
01:27:19,312 --> 01:27:20,547
No, teacher, you can't!

1006
01:27:51,678 --> 01:27:55,049
<i>- Reverend!
- Remember what you've learned.</i>

1007
01:27:55,082 --> 01:27:57,751
<i>Now, are you ready
to let it all go?</i>

1008
01:27:57,784 --> 01:27:58,752
<i>All the people you harmed?</i>

1009
01:28:05,993 --> 01:28:08,762
<i>Killing those men
isn't gonna bring her back.</i>

1010
01:28:08,795 --> 01:28:10,497
Do it, preacher.

1011
01:28:11,731 --> 01:28:15,301
<i>Mercy
is a rare and powerful tool.</i>

1012
01:28:15,335 --> 01:28:16,536
<i>Tabitha.</i>

1013
01:28:21,574 --> 01:28:24,811
<i>"Blessed are the peacekeepers.
Blessed are the merciful."</i>

1014
01:28:24,844 --> 01:28:26,013
<i>I know what I said.</i>

1015
01:28:26,046 --> 01:28:27,413
<i>So stop.</i>

1016
01:28:33,921 --> 01:28:34,889
No.

1017
01:28:37,091 --> 01:28:38,758
You live with yourself.

1018
01:28:41,095 --> 01:28:43,296
Your judgment
will come soon enough.

1019
01:28:49,569 --> 01:28:50,737
I knew it.

1020
01:28:52,539 --> 01:28:54,707
I knew that you would fail.

1021
01:29:00,981 --> 01:29:03,050
Run away, preacher.

1022
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:05,986
You liar. You fraud!

1023
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:08,122
You failure, you two
deserve each other!

1024
01:29:08,155 --> 01:29:09,789
The both of you, you're weak!

1025
01:29:09,823 --> 01:29:13,127
Undisciplined! I have no
more use for you or her!

1026
01:29:13,160 --> 01:29:16,462
You take her, you hear me?
Take her!

1027
01:29:16,496 --> 01:29:18,598
That's right.
You take her and go!

1028
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,835
She's being punished
down in the barrels.

1029
01:29:21,869 --> 01:29:24,704
She might even still be alive.
I hope she is!

1030
01:29:24,737 --> 01:29:26,539
Because you two
deserve each other.

1031
01:29:26,573 --> 01:29:28,608
I want you two to live
your lives out together.

1032
01:29:28,641 --> 01:29:32,478
Your small,
boring, pointless lives!

1033
01:29:32,512 --> 01:29:36,382
Never growing, changing,
never expanding your minds!

1034
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:38,685
Just living day
by pathetic day,

1035
01:29:38,718 --> 01:29:41,088
working, praying,
mediocre, impotent,

1036
01:29:41,121 --> 01:29:43,756
obedient to your
corporate masters!

1037
01:29:45,159 --> 01:29:47,493
I could think
of no greater punishment.

1038
01:29:48,062 --> 01:29:49,762
Do you hear me?

1039
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:17,490
Tabitha?

1040
01:30:44,651 --> 01:30:45,920
Tabitha?

1041
01:30:45,953 --> 01:30:46,887
Tabitha.

1042
01:30:56,829 --> 01:30:58,198
Oh, God.

1043
01:30:58,232 --> 01:31:00,566
Tabitha. Tabitha?

1044
01:31:07,074 --> 01:31:08,008
Reverend?

1045
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:11,678
Hey.

1046
01:31:13,646 --> 01:31:15,682
I knew you were coming.

1047
01:31:19,987 --> 01:31:22,655
How'd you...
How'd you find me?

1048
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:28,795
I almost didn't.

1049
01:31:39,206 --> 01:31:41,075
Almost didn't.

1050
01:31:45,778 --> 01:31:46,746
Is it over?

1051
01:32:29,289 --> 01:32:33,027
So, who will be next
to speak into the flame?

1052
01:32:35,095 --> 01:32:36,662
Daisy?

1053
01:32:37,865 --> 01:32:38,999
Come on up here.

1054
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:43,669
Who is that?

1055
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:45,906
- Teacher!
- Who is that?

1056
01:32:45,939 --> 01:32:48,876
This is private property!
You are tres...

1057
01:32:50,676 --> 01:32:54,148
Don't shoot! I'll give you money!
I swear. Anything!

1058
01:33:02,356 --> 01:33:03,924
It's done.

1059
01:33:03,957 --> 01:33:05,558
<i>And Beckman?</i>

1060
01:33:07,094 --> 01:33:08,929
He's not here.

1061
01:33:08,962 --> 01:33:11,798
Find him. Finish it.
