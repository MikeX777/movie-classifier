1
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:49,125
We will hear

2
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:50,500
from the President
of the United States.

3
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,209
He will address the country
in mere moments now,

4
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:53,626
speaking from the east room.

5
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:57,209
It is going to be a confirmation
of a huge development.

6
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:03,250
Good evening.

7
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:06,876
Tonight, I can report
to the American people

8
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,083
and to the world...

9
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,918
the United States has conducted
an operation that killed

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,542
Osama bin Laden,
the leader of AL-Qaeda.

11
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:33,334
Tonight we give thanks
to the countless intelligence

12
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:34,834
and counterterrorism
professionals

13
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,709
who worked tirelessly
to achieve this outcome.

14
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,834
The American people
do not see their work,

15
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:43,292
nor know their names,

16
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,792
but tonight they feel
the satisfaction of their work.

17
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,375
 I think women
make fantastic analysts.

18
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:44,459
We have
patience and perseverance.

19
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:51,167
And we're not always looking
for the sexy payoff immediately.

20
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,167
You know, trying to keep track

21
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,667
of all the threads
of various threats,

22
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,542
and which ones are real
and which ones aren't real

23
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:04,751
and what connects to what.

24
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,500
And, you know, people say,

25
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:08,542
"Why didn't you
connect the dots?"

26
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:10,500
"Well, because
the whole page is black?"

27
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,292
To pull a story

28
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,042
out of all of
this information,

29
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,709
but there is no one
single intelligence looking

30
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:31,083
at all this information.

31
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,334
It's a lot of different
brains looking.

32
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,334
So the more that you
can bring people together

33
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,667
and, you know,
share what's important,

34
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,125
the better it works.

35
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,959
At that time, the people
who had

36
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:46,709
really deep expertise
in AL-Qaeda...

37
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,876
you know, they were women.

38
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,209
And they did a job that
at first did not make them

39
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,667
very popular
with their managers.

40
00:04:55,751 --> 00:05:01,292
I was counseled once
in a performance review

41
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,626
that I was spending too much
time working on bin Laden.

42
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:10,042
They said we
were obsessed crusaders,

43
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,417
overly emotional.

44
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,000
You know, using all
those women's stereotypes.

45
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,167
Men throw chairs.
Women cry.

46
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,250
I ask you,
Which one is better?

47
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,918
Yes, we were
borderline obsessed,

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,292
but I thought it was
for a good reason.

49
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,584
And were we crusading?

50
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,250
I wouldn't call it
a crusade.

51
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:30,667
Were we passionate about
what they were doing?

52
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,959
Absolutely.

53
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,542
And that's
another bureaucratic
norm of the time.

54
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,417
You weren't supposed to be
passionate about anything,

55
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,792
which I think
is ridiculous.

56
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,459
How can you do something
like this without passion?

57
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,667
You can't.

58
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:22,250
"Take a stand.
We drove out the Russians.

59
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:24,584
"We destroyed
the Russian empire.

60
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,083
"Now we'll drive out
the Americans

61
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,125
"and we'll destroy
the U.S. empire.

62
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:31,792
It worked then,
it'll work here."

63
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,709
He felt
like the United States

64
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:38,250
was driving a world movement
against Muslims

65
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:41,792
and was the driver
for everything

66
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:44,417
that was happening
that was bad.

67
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:16,667
Your starting
point is Afghanistan.

68
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:20,209
Abdullah Azzam is the godfather
of the Afghan jihad.

69
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,751
He is the one who called
everyone to go and fight

70
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:25,125
in Afghanistan
against the Soviets.

71
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:28,417
He helped set up a council
of charities to bring

72
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,667
people and money to help
with jihad.

73
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,667
And his partner
was Osama bin Laden.

74
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,876
A link chart
is the visual representation

75
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,709
of a terrorist network.

76
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,542
And it's what terrorism
analysts spend

77
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,292
much of their time
building.

78
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,125
My mental image is
that, you know, I'm doing

79
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,292
Jacob's ladder.

80
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,542
You've got the string
where you're pulling

81
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:48,876
the strings
in your fingers.

82
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,626
I feel like that's
what I'm doing mentally.

83
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,042
Well, we
certainly didn't know

84
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,334
that AL-Qaeda existed.

85
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,584
We didn't know there was
a terrorist organization.

86
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,250
We knew there was
a very wealthy man

87
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:02,584
named Osama bin Laden,

88
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,667
who was funding a lot
of terrorist groups.

89
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,000
We knew that there were
people from terrorist groups

90
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,876
from all over the world,
hanging out in Afghanistan

91
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,375
and in bin Laden's
circle.

92
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,500
So you start to see
signs of what looks like

93
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:14,959
an organization.

94
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:17,709
But is this bin Laden
as a financial manager

95
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,292
with a bunch of
companies funding

96
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,042
various terrorist groups

97
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,834
or is there a separate
terrorist group here?

98
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:25,584
And that was
a big question.

99
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,000
Even in the analytical
community, there's

100
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,584
a relatively smaller
percentage of people

101
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,125
who are really good
at making sense

102
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,292
of information that doesn't
appear to be connected.

103
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,792
So this is what we call
pattern analysis...

104
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:45,626
trying to figure out
what things look like.

105
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,209
And those people, you really
need those people to work

106
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,459
on an issue like terrorism,
counter-narcotic,

107
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,542
international arms
trafficking

108
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:53,918
because you've got

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,334
bits and pieces
of scattered information

110
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:56,584
from all over the place

111
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,500
and you have to try to
make some sense of it.

112
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,709
And these are
organizations...

113
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:03,250
certainly AL-Qaeda
was one...

114
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,459
didn't even want to announce
their presence to the world

115
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:06,918
for a long time.

116
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,125
You have to try to
figure out they're there

117
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,918
when they're trying to
deny, even to their friends,

118
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,584
that they exist.

119
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,292
That takes this talent,
which is also a skill,

120
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,626
and people would refer
to it as magic.

121
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,250
Not the analysts
doing it,

122
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,083
but other people who
didn't have that talent

123
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,125
referred to it as magic.

124
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:33,417
What I have here
are four half-dollars.

125
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,876
When you're following

126
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,584
an intelligence event,
sometimes things move

127
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,584
and change in ways
that you can't see.

128
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,500
You might think
it's in one place,

129
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:43,876
and it pops up in another,

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,751
and you can't see
how that happens.

131
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:51,167
So these coins
are gonna jump one at a time

132
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,709
from here all the way
over to here.

133
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:58,959
But they're going
to do it invisibly.

134
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:03,292
1, 2, 3, 4. Watch.

135
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,500
See it jump? Heh. Heh.

136
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,500
Reality is changing

137
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,542
all the time.

138
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,584
A single fact may come in
which dramatically changes

139
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,125
your understanding
and your projection

140
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:24,751
of where something's going.

141
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,751
Two and two.

142
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,959
Are you with me?

143
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,542
Now, an analyst

144
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,834
in the intelligence
profession

145
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:34,918
is dealing
with highly ambiguous situations

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,751
in which information is
arriving incrementally,

147
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,375
in fragments.

148
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,083
Are you with me?

149
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,167
You never get the whole picture.

150
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,167
The picture changes
as these pieces arrive.

151
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,626
Your perception
of reality changes.

152
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,626
You have to be very clear
about what you concretely

153
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:56,542
know and what you
don't know.

154
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:13,375
Alec Station was
a collection of people

155
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:15,250
who had backgrounds
in everything

156
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:17,918
from analysis to operations.

157
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,167
When you think
about the CIA,

158
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,918
there's a few
different cultures there.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,042
One is an analytic culture...

160
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,834
people who try
to assess things,

161
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:31,125
figure out what is actually
happening somewhere

162
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,876
and project ahead...

163
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,459
and an operational culture,

164
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,834
that is, people who go out
and collect intelligence,

165
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,626
develop human spies,

166
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:41,459
handle them,
run them, if you will.

167
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,375
The unique thing
about Alec Station was

168
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:51,667
the fusion
of analysis and operations.

169
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:54,125
We pushed the analysts
and the operations people

170
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,334
together, so the operations
people knew everything

171
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,709
the analysts were thinking

172
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,250
and the analysts knew
everything

173
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,292
the operations people
were doing.

174
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,542
Covertly, clandestinely,
secretly, dangerously.

175
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:08,751
And the fusion
of those two things gave

176
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:11,167
that organization
the magic it had.

177
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,042
The people I worked
with in the beginning were

178
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,584
six women.

179
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:21,542
I walked
in my first day there.

180
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:22,792
I turned around
to my colleagues...

181
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,042
this is a bay
of six analysts...

182
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,292
and I said, "Does
anybody have any Tums?"

183
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,292
And all these drawers
open

184
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,876
with these gigantic
bottles!

185
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,459
I thought,
"Oh, my God.

186
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,167
What have I done
to myself?" Ha ha!

187
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,834
When I moved over, there was

188
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:36,834
a group of women
that I reached out to.

189
00:12:36,918 --> 00:12:40,083
We were trying to protect
the United States.

190
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,042
Whether we could do that,

191
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,918
it's a big...it's a big
burden.

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,334
I was drawn to those women

193
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,459
because of the job
that they were doing.

194
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:51,542
I mean, substantively they
were so immersed in finding

195
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,792
bin Laden and tracking,

196
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,167
and some of them had been
around working

197
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,626
this subject matter
for so long

198
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,292
that they were
the people I went to.

199
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,125
It wasn't even
because they were women.

200
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,083
Gina Bennett was a mentor
of mine and still is.

201
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,834
She worked on AL-Qaeda
for 20 years.

202
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:12,542
Gina and Barbara, they put
a stake in the ground

203
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,500
and said, "It's OK if we're
not operations officers.

204
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,500
We can be
just as effective."

205
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:18,417
The rest of the organization

206
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,250
didn't necessarily think
much of terrorism analysts.

207
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,334
They said, "Well, the terrorism
people are just tracking

208
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:27,417
"things. That's not...
real analysis.

209
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,667
That's just tracking
things."

210
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:33,500
So we poor, lowly
terrorism analysts,

211
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,500
we were tracking things.

212
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,584
You're gonna have certain
kinds of people who are

213
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,500
going to be the first
ones to see something.

214
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:40,834
When you're
the first one

215
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:42,292
off the block,
by definition

216
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,834
you're going to be
in the minority.

217
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,417
That's what we were.

218
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,792
She was
very dedicated to her job.

219
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,125
She was there a lot.

220
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,250
You know, Jennifer
was one of that first group,

221
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:04,584
and she was always very
intense, very focused,

222
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,751
really passionate about
it from the beginning

223
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,500
and a real hard-charger
from the beginning.

224
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:12,417
Jennifer was focused
on finding bin Laden.

225
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,500
She was adamant that she was
gonna stay around

226
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:19,918
on that team
until it was done.

227
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,709
She could be
really abrasive.

228
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:31,250
Yeah, but, you know,
teams are made up

229
00:14:31,334 --> 00:14:32,834
of people with all different
kinds of personalities.

230
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:35,083
And at the end of the day,
that doesn't really matter.

231
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,375
What matters is getting
the job done.

232
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,375
And she certainly
could do that.

233
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,792
We had a camaraderie.

234
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,626
And in the beginning, we
were such a small organization

235
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,167
that we really had
a very close relationship.

236
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,584
On the operations side,

237
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,834
this is where
all the spies work.

238
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,959
Which are the ones
you always see in the movies

239
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,083
running around
recruiting assets

240
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,918
and playing James Bond
or whatever.

241
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,000
It is dangerous.
It is dangerous.

242
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,542
These guys need confidence
to be able to pull that off.

243
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,500
There is
a fair amount of bravado.

244
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,292
You know, we're
case officers, right?

245
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,000
We're the jet fighters,
we're the gangsters,

246
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,167
we're the doers.

247
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,000
You know, analysts?
Come on, man.

248
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,334
I think a component
of the personality

249
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,584
in some cases for the job.

250
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,584
There's varying degrees
of that.

251
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,125
I was out
in the bush, in that arena,

252
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,083
downrange,
regardless of environment.

253
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,542
Often times,
you see in the movies...

254
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:57,959
you talk about agents.

255
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,584
You know, he's a CIA agent.

256
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,209
Well, the agents are
the people we recruit.

257
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,375
"Hi. I'm CIA. I'm
assigned to this embassy.

258
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:04,751
Would you like to be a spy?"

259
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,626
That's why it
doesn't work that way.

260
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:20,125
A case officer's job is to spot,

261
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,667
assess, and develop...

262
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:27,000
find people who have
access to secrets,

263
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,709
get to know them,

264
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:31,500
get them to trust you,

265
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:33,375
recruit them,

266
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,042
and then keep them safe.

267
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:40,626
In my particular experience,
because I do speak Arabic...

268
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,042
I have been asked to meet
some of our friends

269
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:58,167
in risky areas,
dangerous areas.

270
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,751
Obviously, you need
to get to the point

271
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,417
of building trust.

272
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,918
They look in your face,
and they see an American

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
who has risked a lot
to get there

274
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:11,709
to sit down and meet
with them.

275
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:15,709
They do believe, honestly,
that you care

276
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:19,042
for their welfare,
you care for them,

277
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,876
and you respect what
they're providing you with.

278
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,584
You're playing
this chess game.

279
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,375
He was recruiting

280
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:26,834
basically very idealistic
Saudi university students

281
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:28,709
to come to fight
the Soviets.

282
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,959
Then some of them
went to Afghanistan,

283
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,542
including
bin Laden himself.

284
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:47,000
It's intensely religious.

285
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,334
I mean, coming here was

286
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:49,792
an intensely religious
experience

287
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:52,083
for these very idealistic
young Muslim men.

288
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,751
And, you know, these
magazines have many stories

289
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,709
about people being martyred
fighting the Soviets

290
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:58,167
and their bodies
don't decompose

291
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,792
or their bodies
smell of perfume.

292
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:02,959
And this was a highly
effective propaganda to get

293
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,125
other people
to come and volunteer.

294
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,959
This
magazine called "Jihad"

295
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,876
was on sale in countries
around the Islamic world.

296
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:36,626
The very first copy
was published in 1984.

297
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,250
There's a guy called
Abu Abdullah

298
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,959
in these magazines,
and that was bin Laden.

299
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:45,334
No one really knew who
bin Laden was at the time.

300
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,542
So during
the Afghan-Soviet war,

301
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:06,876
the camps were set up
by bin Laden and others

302
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:09,334
to train Afghans
and people from...

303
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,792
who came
from all over the world

304
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,375
to go and fight
against the Soviets.

305
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,792
Towards the end of the war,
some of these camps

306
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:22,209
got converted over

307
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:25,083
into urban guerilla
warfare camps.

308
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,667
And this is as,
what we now know

309
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,000
was AL-Qaeda, were taking
over some of these camps,

310
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,876
and they were starting
to train people

311
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,292
to conduct
urban guerilla warfare

312
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,292
in various countries,
like Egypt and Algeria.

313
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,292
One of the prominent figures
in the training camps

314
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,167
in Afghanistan is
a gentleman who went

315
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,751
by the war name
of Abu Zubaydah.

316
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:51,667
He was definitely running
parts of the camps network.

317
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:59,417
So now it's after the war
in the early nineties.

318
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,292
We started to get
all these reports

319
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,584
about things blowing up
all over the world,

320
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,459
who were from people who
had fought in Afghanistan.

321
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:10,709
So that's when we started
to say to ourselves,

322
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,000
What is going on here?

323
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,876
Let's try to figure out,
Is there some kind of

324
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,209
an organization?

325
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:18,250
Is it a social movement?
What is it?

326
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:22,167
And we're starting
to warn,

327
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,500
"Look this is going
to be a problem."

328
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,751
And we actually issued
some of that warning

329
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:31,083
before the first
World Trade Center bombing.

330
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:49,125
Ramzi Yousef, I'm sure,
everybody knows

331
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:51,292
from the first
World Trade Center attack.

332
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,500
He is the cousin/nephew
of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

333
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,959
and the attack
was partly funded

334
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,918
by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

335
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,792
The same year there is
the incident referred to

336
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,584
as the Black Hawk Down
incident.

337
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,792
We didn't learn until later
the extent to which

338
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:11,751
AL-Qaeda at least
was involved.

339
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:22,876
These plots
are multiple nationalities.

340
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:26,000
This is not your
typical events, right?

341
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,125
We can't pin this on
any one terrorist group.

342
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:30,667
What's going on here?

343
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,792
Oh, I mean, it was
bin Laden.

344
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:39,542
There was no doubt that
the common purpose had to be

345
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:40,876
bin Laden.

346
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,375
All of a sudden,
it just hit me

347
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,250
that this is
a bureaucracy.

348
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,125
So by 1998, we were
able to say with confidence

349
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,792
this is a worldwide
terrorist organization.

350
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:57,250
Bin Laden is the head
of this organization.

351
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,834
Their goal is global jihad.

352
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:01,751
They want to create
a global Islamic government.

353
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,876
It's not
just about Saudi Arabia.

354
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,125
There was still some
debate what it was called

355
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:10,000
because some said it
was called the Islamic Army.

356
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:12,000
It was
my analytical judgment

357
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,125
that it was called
AL-Qaeda.

358
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,876
At that time
in '97, Osama bin Laden

359
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,709
had declared war
on the United States

360
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:41,918
in an Arab language
newspaper,

361
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,792
and no one paid
any attention.

362
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:49,000
You know, the case that I
made to them was, you know,

363
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,792
if you're going to declare
war on the United States,

364
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,042
don't do it on the BBC.

365
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:54,500
Do it
on an American network.

366
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:57,667
And CNN is seen
all around the world.

367
00:23:57,751 --> 00:24:01,626
And also we have
a reputation for being fair.

368
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:03,125
It was a lengthy process.

369
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,375
They were very concerned.

370
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:06,709
"Are you agents of the CIA?"

371
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,709
"Will you give
Osama bin Laden a fair shake

372
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,584
if we allow you to do
this interview?"

373
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,417
Eventually after a month
or so, we got the sort of

374
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,042
coded message that we're
gonna go and see bin Laden.

375
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,209
They picked
us up at dusk

376
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:37,542
in a van sort
of like this, right?

377
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,876
Yeah, very similar
to this. Yeah.

378
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,209
But in the evening. Yeah.

379
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,751
Yeah, in
the evening. Yeah.

380
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,792
And then they gave
us the sunglasses

381
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,667
that had cardboard
inside them.

382
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,417
Right. And sort of
crude blindfolds.

383
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,626
That's right.

384
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:52,209
Did they put those on...
immediately on us?

385
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,334
Yep, they did.
Right.

386
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:00,667
The interesting thing is

387
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,292
that when you go
to Kabul,

388
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,876
you go through
these tunnels.

389
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,584
So the fact that we
were blindfolded,

390
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,000
you could hear...
feel the change

391
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:08,959
in air pressure
and actually hear

392
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,792
the difference in sound
in the tunnel.

393
00:25:14,584 --> 00:25:16,709
So you had something
of a good idea

394
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,375
of where we were
heading?

395
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:19,626
Yeah, yep.

396
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,292
And on the other
side of this,

397
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:24,209
this is where
AL-Qaeda had its

398
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:25,375
chemical weapons,

399
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,000
crude chemical
weapons facility.

400
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,792
Straight down.
Yeah.

401
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,042
So we got to...sort of

402
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,459
this plateau, right?

403
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:37,918
I think it was about
6,000 feet up maybe

404
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,167
or something like that.

405
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,292
Something
like that, yeah.

406
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,792
And there was
a small village,

407
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:43,292
the type that would be
used by shepherds

408
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,125
to put their sheep
in at night.

409
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,626
Yeah.

410
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,709
Peter Arnett was a correspondent.

411
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:53,626
He was at the time
arguably the most famous

412
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,667
journalist in the world.

413
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:57,500
They put carpets down,

414
00:25:57,584 --> 00:26:00,375
so they made it
respectable.

415
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,209
And then, as I recall,
we waited

416
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,626
for some period of time

417
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:06,334
and had some sort of
goat-like dinner.

418
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:07,542
That's right, yeah...

419
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:09,876
This is, like,
the hostage video.

420
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:13,167
Yeah, the hostage video.

421
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,250
Do you recall when he came in?

422
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,250
Yep.

423
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,584
And he shook
your hand, right?

424
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:21,709
Yep. Yep.

425
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:23,292
Do you remember
what that felt like?

426
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,000
It was sort of
like a dead fish.

427
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,792
I mean, it wasn't
a strong grasp.

428
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,959
Cold, a bit like...

429
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,626
I compare it sometimes

430
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,250
to a bank manager's
shake, you know?

431
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:36,709
Thank you,
Mr. bin Laden.

432
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,792
Is there
anything you'd like to add?

433
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,167
Hmm?

434
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,834
Anything you'd like
to add?

435
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:46,250
We should
change the tape.

436
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,292
I think
we'll just relax a minute,

437
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,167
- I think.
- OK, fine.

438
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,584
Just relax now.

439
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,292
Just get my knees.

440
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:57,500
I'm not used to this.

441
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:01,250
Not quite
finished. The feed...

442
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:04,626
Well, Mr. bin Laden's
voice is in good...

443
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:05,792
Good condition.

444
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:06,918
Good condition.

445
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,167
It got better as you got...

446
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,375
Hot.

447
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:13,792
more into the subject,
as you talked about it.

448
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:56,167
I did think that this was

449
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,876
an amazing interview. Yeah.

450
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,584
He declared
war on the United States

451
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:01,209
for the first time to

452
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,918
an English-speaking
audience.

453
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,876
We asked him why.

454
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:26,542
You know, he basically
gave a laundry list

455
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,417
of complaints about
American foreign policy

456
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,459
in the Muslim world.

457
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,292
We asked him to clarify,

458
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,334
Did that mean a war
against American soldiers

459
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,876
or American civilians?

460
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,918
He sort of said American soldiers

461
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,209
were the primary target.

462
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:49,542
If American civilians
got in the way,

463
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:50,876
that was their problem.

464
00:28:54,709 --> 00:28:57,209
He said that in his mind,

465
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,667
the United States
was as weak

466
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,250
as the former Soviet Union.

467
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,417
And eventually

468
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,959
the United States,
if it was subjected

469
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:17,667
to enough violent pressure,
would pull out

470
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:19,125
of the Middle East,

471
00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:21,000
and basically
he would get his wish.

472
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:25,751
What
are your future plans?

473
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,292
Can we get a couple
of still pictures now?

474
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,834
Some photographs?

475
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:50,918
The impact
of the interview at the time

476
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,209
was, I would say,
pretty muted.

477
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,000
You know, it didn't get
a lot of play,

478
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,167
because at the time,
of course,

479
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,959
he hadn't really done
anything.

480
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,584
Imagine if in 1937

481
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:06,209
the Japanese army had gone
on NBC or RKO to say,

482
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,500
"Hey, we are planning

483
00:30:07,584 --> 00:30:09,042
to attack
the United States."

484
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,542
You know, Pearl Harbor
might have turned out
differently.

485
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,000
These guys repeatedly
said publicly,

486
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,375
"We are planning
to attack

487
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,500
the United States,"

488
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:16,250
and no one paid
any attention.

489
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:27,792
I always watched
their latest statements.

490
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:29,459
Their choices
of what they're gonna say

491
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,959
are very important.

492
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:34,500
Oh, yeah they were cagey at
first about claiming credit

493
00:31:34,584 --> 00:31:35,918
for anything.

494
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,292
They didn't
want to claim credit.

495
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:42,667
Then later on, they become
more willing to take credit,

496
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,167
in fact demanding credit
for it.

497
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,042
You know, it's all
this stuff hitting you,

498
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:02,751
all these horrible
images hitting you.

499
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,751
It's just this rapid fire,

500
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:10,500
horribly evil music video/
horror film, slash...

501
00:32:16,709 --> 00:32:20,209
Al-Qaeda is
a global organization

502
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,584
made up of people
from over 60 countries

503
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:25,292
who speak 60 different
languages.

504
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:28,792
So they really have to
communicate in the clear

505
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,626
through
these statements.

506
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,584
And they're also under
a religious obligation

507
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:33,918
to warn their enemy.

508
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,459
So for all of those reasons,
it made complete sense

509
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:40,083
that they meant
what they said.

510
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,125
They're planning
something.

511
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:04,375
But where? When? What?

512
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:06,459
Is it going to be
an armed assault?

513
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:08,667
Is it going
to be a hijacking?

514
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:11,834
Is it going to be
an assassination?

515
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:17,209
A bomb? You know, where?

516
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:19,667
There were no real answers.

517
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,876
The CIA
did very good warning

518
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,083
in that period of time.

519
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,125
There are dozens
and dozens of reports

520
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,584
in which we express the view

521
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:34,834
that bin Laden is intending
to attack the United States.

522
00:33:36,334 --> 00:33:38,918
We would have weekly
or biweekly meetings

523
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,417
sometimes on exactly

524
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,918
what was going on.

525
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,292
It's so frustrating

526
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:46,459
when you can't figure
out date and time.

527
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:49,375
There's always
a large band of uncertainty,

528
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,417
and that's fertile ground

529
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,918
for argument.

530
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,042
And if you warn
about every little thing,

531
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,292
then you're crying wolf

532
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:58,000
and nobody pays
attention to you at all.

533
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,250
Middle East,
South Asia, Europe,

534
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,000
United States. Where?

535
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,792
You just don't know.

536
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,584
We did not
at this time

537
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:08,959
and in this report have

538
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,918
what I would call
"actionable intelligence."

539
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,751
"I want to know when,
I want to know where,

540
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,083
I want to know who."

541
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,292
We could not
determine time,

542
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,626
target, and method.

543
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,417
You know, I really
wish I could tell you

544
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,792
when and where.

545
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:24,792
But it's not that easy with
a clandestine organization.

546
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:26,834
"Well, if you just had
more human assets and you

547
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,751
"did less analysis,
then we would know

548
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,083
all these things."

549
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:31,417
Well, that isn't true.

550
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,250
You can say we're pretty
sure it's gonna happen,

551
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:38,584
but we can't make
that decision to say,

552
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,918
you should do or not do.

553
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,667
We can say that
our bottom line is,

554
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,167
"It looks pretty dangerous."

555
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:57,250
The headline says,

556
00:34:57,334 --> 00:35:00,542
"Bin Laden Determined
to Strike In U.S."

557
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:02,209
There were just warning
after warning after warning

558
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:03,500
all spring.

559
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:06,500
Well, you know with
the benefit of hindsight...

560
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:08,626
We knew something
huge was gonna happen.

561
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,792
it would seem that this was

562
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,042
a perfect warning

563
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,834
in August of 2001

564
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:18,125
that the United States
was about to be attacked.

565
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,834
Everybody was
completely tense.

566
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,667
Why didn't we
do something about this?

567
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:26,751
The language being used
by these guys was like,

568
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,375
"Oh, my God.
What are they gonna do?"

569
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,751
On the morning of 9/11,

570
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:27,375
I was sitting
in my office.

571
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:29,667
My office was here.

572
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:32,584
The office of the group
chief was right next to it.

573
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,083
And I had my door open,
and I looked,

574
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:36,459
and there was an analyst

575
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:39,334
running through the row
between the cubicles.

576
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,792
And it was one
of the older analysts.

577
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:45,125
And you don't see
older analysts running.

578
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:47,542
I was in Jordan.

579
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:49,000
I was at the CIA.

580
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,292
9/11, I was in my office at NSA.

581
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,500
I was at the Executive Office
Building of the White House.

582
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:56,626
I was in the Pentagon
when it got hit.

583
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:59,834
The first breaking news
was coming in.

584
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:01,792
Somebody has it
on RealPlayer

585
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:03,375
on their...at their desk.

586
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:04,959
The report was saying
there was a small aircraft

587
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,417
that apparently had hit.

588
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,459
Right then, second
plane into the second tower,

589
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:11,626
and I knew.

590
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:14,167
There was no doubt in
that office at that moment

591
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,918
that this is what we were
waiting for.

592
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,292
This is it.

593
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,667
That's the words that went
through everybody's mind.

594
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:21,375
This is it.
This is bin Laden.

595
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:23,375
"It's an attack,
it's terrorism,

596
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:24,959
and it's AL-Qaeda."

597
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:26,209
I knew who they were.

598
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:27,626
I knew what
their intentions were.

599
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:30,000
This is it.
They pulled this thing off.

600
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,751
We're going
to battle stations.

601
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:34,459
And we were all evacuated
after that second plane

602
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,876
went in because we thought
the next one...that is,

603
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:39,000
the Shanksville plane...
might be headed for us.

604
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,334
It was complete chaos.

605
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:44,042
The plane flew in
under my office.

606
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:48,042
My two assistants looked out
the window and saw a 757

607
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,751
fly in under their feet.

608
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:51,250
The order then went out

609
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:56,167
for the building
to be evacuated, except

610
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,709
for the counterterrorism
analysts.

611
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,375
We essentially decamped
from the high-rises

612
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:01,918
and moved on into
the operations center.

613
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,959
I said, "Look, chief says
we can't go, but, you know,

614
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:10,417
if you want to leave,
I'll cover for you."

615
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,000
And not one
of those people left.

616
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,542
19 guys.

617
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:29,209
Look at their faces
and think

618
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:33,459
about the tragic,
terrible, consequences.

619
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:39,459
19. Only 19.

620
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,292
19 representing thousands

621
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:44,250
who went through training
camps in Afghanistan.

622
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:47,334
19 representing all those
who were sponsored

623
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:52,792
and trained and blessed
these young men on that day.

624
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,250
This is where
it gets hard to talk.

625
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,417
I have to say the worst
moment in my life

626
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,792
happened
in about November

627
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,542
because right
after the bombing,

628
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:16,542
you're just so busy.

629
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:19,083
And everybody, you know...
cry at home; come to work;

630
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,584
be professional;
do your job;

631
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,083
go home; cry at home;
come to work;

632
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:23,375
be professional;
and do your job.

633
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:25,500
And people were very
focused, running around,

634
00:40:25,584 --> 00:40:27,042
getting the job done.

635
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,834
On about November,
things started

636
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:30,459
to slow down
a little bit,

637
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:32,000
and the guilt sets in.

638
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,542
And that is
just the worst.

639
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:35,417
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna cry now.

640
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,167
Um...

641
00:40:38,876 --> 00:40:41,125
feeling like you wish you
could have done something,

642
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:42,959
but especially
when all the criticism

643
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:44,459
starts to come in.

644
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,000
People would say things
in Congress like,

645
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,584
"You were negligent."

646
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:48,959
I was like, "Really?

647
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,918
"What did you know about
bin Laden before 2001?

648
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,292
"Nothing! You didn't
help us at all.

649
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:56,417
And now you're blaming
us for having tried..."

650
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,292
This is not a matter of scapegoating.

651
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,334
This is a matter
of accountability.

652
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,751
There has been...

653
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:04,042
What does the term

654
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,417
"accountability"
mean to you?

655
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,042
Prior to September 11th,

656
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,500
U.S. intelligence officials

657
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,584
possessed
terrorist information

658
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:15,292
that, if properly handled,
could have disrupted

659
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,209
or possibly prevented
the terrorist attacks.

660
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:18,417
It seems

661
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,042
from your testimony...

662
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,542
That information was

663
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:23,125
not distributed to the FBI.

664
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:28,042
...The CIA analysts

665
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,667
and FBI officials in
the New York field office...

666
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:31,751
Has anyone in the CIA

667
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,667
been held accountable
for the failures

668
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:35,959
of September 11th

669
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:38,459
or the events
leading up to it?

670
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:55,876
Jennifer called me
not long after 9/11,

671
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:57,751
screaming at me
on the phone.

672
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,042
And we were just in...
we were,

673
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,500
a two-second walk
from each other

674
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:01,751
in different vaults.

675
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:02,918
But, "You did this.
This is your fault.

676
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,292
You didn't report
on..." so-and-so.

677
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:05,667
Blah-blah-blah-blah-
blah-blah-blah...

678
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,042
And I screamed
back at her

679
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,375
and slammed
the phone down.

680
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,751
And at the time,
I was really angry,

681
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,375
and I actually really
never spoke to her again.

682
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:13,626
But looking back on it,

683
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:15,334
I think it's just...
it was just

684
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,417
a manifestation
of her passion

685
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,000
and her sense of...
her own sense of guilt.

686
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,292
I mean,
everybody felt it.

687
00:42:49,209 --> 00:42:53,334
We were told to evacuate Yemen.

688
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,459
The entire team
already boarded the plane,

689
00:42:56,542 --> 00:43:00,125
and I was asked

690
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:02,250
that I will stay,
I should stay

691
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,876
and to talk to
an individual named

692
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:07,083
Nasser AL-Bahri...
Abu Jandal.

693
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:17,500
We showed him
a photo book

694
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:19,250
that has a lot
of photos in it.

695
00:43:20,626 --> 00:43:22,292
He identified bin Laden,

696
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,125
he identified
Ayman Zawahiri...

697
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:26,292
He identified
the usual suspects

698
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,459
that there is no way
he would never know.

699
00:43:28,542 --> 00:43:30,918
But he didn't
identify anyone

700
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,918
from the, you know,
second tier.

701
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,209
No one.

702
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:37,626
And then he closed
the book.

703
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:39,500
"I don't have
anything else.

704
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:40,876
Don't know anyone."

705
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:43,375
So I ask him, "Please.
Can you look at it again?"

706
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:46,292
But I just said,
"Please. You know,

707
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,417
come on.
Look at it again."

708
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,167
He was annoyed.

709
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,667
He said, "I just did.
There is nothing..."

710
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:53,542
"For friendship's sake,
you know?

711
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:55,542
We're now friends..."

712
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:58,584
So he did. Same thing.

713
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:01,542
So I laughed.
I went like...

714
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:04,834
To Bob, I said,
"See? I told you."

715
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:06,292
"What's goin' on?
What did you tell me?"

716
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,459
"Well, I told Bob...
my friend...I told him

717
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:12,334
"here...I said that
you're basically faking.

718
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,167
"You're not
cooperating at all.

719
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,834
And I think
I won the bet."

720
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:17,959
"What are you talking
about? I'm cooperating."

721
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:20,375
"Come on. Really?
You're cooperating?

722
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:21,626
"Do you think
I just flew

723
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,792
"all the way from D.C.
to talk to you

724
00:44:23,876 --> 00:44:25,459
"about this kind of
like small talk

725
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:26,834
"and I don't know
who you are?

726
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:29,000
I don't know
what you know?"

727
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,542
"This guy,
for example...

728
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:33,500
"He was in your
guesthouse in 1999.

729
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,751
"He was sick. You were
taking care of him,

730
00:44:35,834 --> 00:44:37,167
"putting soup
on his lips

731
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,417
"and you claim you have
no idea who this guy is?

732
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,083
I know a lot about
your organization."

733
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:47,292
"Maybe some of these
people in the book are

734
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:48,584
in my custody."

735
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:50,626
"Maybe some of
the people in the book

736
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:52,709
"are friend of mine's.

737
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:54,709
"Maybe they are
my sources.

738
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,500
"Every time I ask
you a question,

739
00:44:57,584 --> 00:45:00,417
"most probably
I know the answer for.

740
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,876
"And that's how I gauge

741
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:04,375
"if you're cooperating
or not.

742
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:07,918
So do you want to start
from the beginning?"

743
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,792
He said, yes.

744
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,876
So we showed him
the book again.

745
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,792
He identified almost
everyone in the book

746
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:15,292
that we know...
we'd assembled...

747
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,125
from the East Africa
Embassy bombing,

748
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:19,292
from the "USS Cole,"

749
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,584
to include eight
of the hijackers.

750
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,417
And he still insisted
that bin Laden

751
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,626
would never do anything
like this.

752
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:26,125
And I insisted
that he did.

753
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:27,459
And I said, "No,
bin Laden did it."

754
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:28,834
And he said,
"Oh, bin Laden did it?

755
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:29,918
Who told you?"

756
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,667
"You did."

757
00:45:31,751 --> 00:45:33,876
And he was mad.
He was furious,

758
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,000
because he thought

759
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,375
I was putting words
in his mouth.

760
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:38,125
I said, "No, you
told me that AL-Qaeda

761
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:40,167
was behind it,
definitely."

762
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,459
And I took a manila
envelope that I had,

763
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:45,918
and I put the photos
that he identified

764
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,751
the seven hijackers...
or the eight hijackers...

765
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:50,125
I put them all
in front of him.

766
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,584
I said, "Do you want to
know who the hijackers?

767
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,375
Those are
the hijackers."

768
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:59,417
"You told me they
were Qaeda members.

769
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,042
You told me that."

770
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,334
He was in total shock.

771
00:46:03,417 --> 00:46:05,000
He put his hand
like this,

772
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,709
and he starts shaking,

773
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:09,292
and he asked for,
you know, five minutes.

774
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,042
We gave him five
minutes, came back.

775
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,375
I said, "So what do
you think now?"

776
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:15,000
And he said, "I think
the Sheikh went crazy.

777
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:16,626
What do you want?"

778
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,709
A small group of
people...many of them women...

779
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:56,542
were blamed.

780
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:58,125
They were blamed.

781
00:46:58,209 --> 00:47:00,667
"They failed to connect
the dots!"

782
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,042
"Connect the dots."

783
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,167
If I hear that...

784
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,667
The Washington machine
turned on them

785
00:47:05,751 --> 00:47:07,167
and said, "It's your fault."

786
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:08,792
"Sit and do a line diagram,
where you failed

787
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:10,167
to connect the dots..."

788
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,500
The dots were there,

789
00:47:11,584 --> 00:47:13,834
It's us who decided to...
we need to erase the dots.

790
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:16,334
Hello! They're coming at us!

791
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,751
That was...
those were late nights.

792
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,125
You go home, you're driving,

793
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:23,959
you roll over what
operations are going on,

794
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,918
what threats you
believe are genuine.

795
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,459
You're thinking about your
friends and colleagues

796
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:28,751
downrange.

797
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:30,792
Sometimes you're thinking
about some talking head

798
00:47:30,876 --> 00:47:33,751
who launched a bunch
of empty bullets,

799
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:38,667
you know, of blame trying
to get their face on the TV

800
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,667
and not understanding
the sincerity

801
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:42,417
of the people involved.

802
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,292
That would cause me
grief the next day

803
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,167
because I knew I was
gonna have to go in

804
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,250
and tell people,
"Listen, they don't

805
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:52,042
"understand what you do.

806
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:54,042
"Don't you know that?

807
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,584
Now, let's get it on."

808
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:04,125
Something that
people don't fully grasp is

809
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:07,083
how alone the CIA felt
in this period of time.

810
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:12,792
Just by virtue of
the evolution of events

811
00:48:12,876 --> 00:48:15,459
in history, we ended up
at this moment in time

812
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:16,918
with kind of
unique knowledge

813
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,042
about this phenomenon,
AL-Qaeda.

814
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:23,000
I think the feeling
all of us had was,

815
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,292
This is on our shoulders
to prevent this

816
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,375
from ever happening again.

817
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:31,834
The day of 9/11,
the President pulled us

818
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:35,667
together and said, "I want
to see a war plan here."

819
00:48:35,751 --> 00:48:39,584
Well, we had been working
on this for a long time.

820
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,250
We were ready to go.

821
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:12,500
The challenge
when you look at AL-Qaeda

822
00:49:12,584 --> 00:49:14,876
after 9/11 was
to understand it well enough

823
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,626
first to disrupt it
and then dismantle it.

824
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:19,209
We're not in the business
of disruption alone,

825
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,959
because if you disrupt
an organization,

826
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,542
the adversary's so committed.

827
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,959
I mean, they believe

828
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:25,792
that what they do is
inspired by a holy book,

829
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:28,334
that they'll just go on
and plot another attack.

830
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:29,876
So the business really
became dismantlement:

831
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:31,125
How do we destroy it?

832
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,042
And that's
a people business.

833
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:38,918
How do you find
the operators, financiers,

834
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,792
trainers, et cetera?

835
00:49:40,876 --> 00:49:42,542
And how can you know where
they're gonna be tomorrow

836
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:43,918
so you can pick them up?

837
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:49,792
The explosion
of intelligence at CIA

838
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:52,209
after 9/11 is
hard to imagine.

839
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:54,292
You have a small group
of people in Alec Station

840
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:56,500
who are looking
at the problem pre-9/11.

841
00:49:56,584 --> 00:50:00,125
They had limited resources.

842
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,876
After 9/11, that small
core group of people

843
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,375
is dwarfed by the newcomers
into the center post-9/11.

844
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:14,876
It was a foundational
change in the organization.

845
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:22,626
They needed managerial horsepower

846
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:27,334
to support the increase
in people and budget.

847
00:50:29,042 --> 00:50:31,834
I did not know enough
about AL-Qaeda.

848
00:50:31,918 --> 00:50:34,417
Just what little I had
read in the press.

849
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,125
Was not my specialty.

850
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:41,375
But, you know,
if you've had 25 years

851
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:43,584
of experience, you come

852
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:47,083
with a pretty good sense
of what needs to be done,

853
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,876
even if it's a new
target for you.

854
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:52,375
Pretty quickly, you learn
what you need to learn

855
00:50:52,459 --> 00:50:54,417
about that target.

856
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:05,792
I became the head of
the Counterterrorism Center

857
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:08,667
just about the time
when we were dealing

858
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:10,584
with all these threats.

859
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,500
I mean, it was daily
constant intelligence

860
00:51:13,584 --> 00:51:17,709
coming about a second wave
of attacks.

861
00:51:17,792 --> 00:51:21,918
But I had a reputation
for building strong teams.

862
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,167
The phone rang.

863
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,125
A senior came on the line,
basically said,

864
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,209
"We need you to come back.

865
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:31,500
"You know the gravity
of the situation.

866
00:51:31,584 --> 00:51:33,918
You need to come back
and do what you do."

867
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:45,959
I basically came back
to be the senior manager

868
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:49,626
for the worldwide effort
against AL-Qaeda.

869
00:51:49,709 --> 00:51:54,125
I had a multidimensional
responsibility.

870
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:56,125
I had to protect my people,
you know?

871
00:51:57,626 --> 00:51:59,959
We changed the rulebook
a bit.

872
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:04,042
We were empowered more.

873
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,542
We did things
more aggressive.

874
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:13,292
"My job is
to kill AL-Qaeda."

875
00:52:15,584 --> 00:52:17,459
"Either get
shoulder-to-shoulder,

876
00:52:17,542 --> 00:52:19,959
get with us,
or get out of our way."

877
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:27,751
We had
been focusing on capturing

878
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:29,292
Abu Zubaydah.

879
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,209
He knew who
the leadership was.

880
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:39,751
He knew their methods
of attack, their targets.

881
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:46,334
He was the highest level
AL-Qaeda terrorist

882
00:52:46,417 --> 00:52:48,417
that we had ever captured.

883
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:57,083
When we captured
him in March, he was

884
00:52:57,167 --> 00:52:58,792
severely wounded,

885
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:01,834
and we knew we had to get
him out of Pakistan.

886
00:53:01,918 --> 00:53:05,167
And in the past, the way
the U.S. had dealt

887
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,209
with issues like this was
to transfer the terrorist

888
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:12,584
to a friendly country
for interrogation,

889
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,083
but we needed to take
responsibility

890
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:19,209
for high level terrorists
ourselves.

891
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:22,209
So we understood
what we had to do.

892
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:23,751
And we did it.

893
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,375
We took a lot of
bad guys off the streets.

894
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:33,125
And they got put up...
and it's now public knowledge...

895
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,000
in a nice little, uh...

896
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:40,792
let's just say...
boutique locations.

897
00:53:51,709 --> 00:53:53,792
Basically you
have two things you have

898
00:53:53,876 --> 00:53:55,292
to bring with you
to an interrogation room,

899
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,250
especially with
individuals like AL-Qaeda.

900
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:00,334
You have to bring knowledge,

901
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:03,876
and you have to bring
empathy.

902
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:05,584
And if you don't have
those two,

903
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:08,918
I think most probably,
you're gonna fail.

904
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,125
He gave us a couple of
pieces...information

905
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:13,167
during that early phase.

906
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:17,834
But then he stopped talking.

907
00:54:17,918 --> 00:54:19,375
When he regained
his strength,

908
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,083
he stopped talking.

909
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:24,250
And we became convinced

910
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:27,626
that we had to come up
with a new alternative

911
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:29,584
to doing this
because it was not working.

912
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:56,083
Eight of the 12 techniques,
in my humble opinion,

913
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,167
were pretty wimpy stuff.

914
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,876
You know, like, slapping.
Give me a break.

915
00:55:00,959 --> 00:55:03,209
OK, it might be unpleasant
to slap somebody,

916
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:05,000
but it's not torture.

917
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,792
Grabbing someone
from the lapel,

918
00:55:06,876 --> 00:55:09,834
bringing him in to you may
be unpleasant

919
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:11,042
and it's
an attention grabber,

920
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,834
but it's not torture.

921
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:14,209
We didn't ask for this.

922
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:16,209
We did not ask
to get attacked.

923
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,500
They did it.

924
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:22,459
And so if we can't make them
uncomfortable to save lives,

925
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:24,459
then...we've missed
the boat here.

926
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:27,459
I believe that
the intention was,

927
00:55:27,542 --> 00:55:29,959
"We can never allow
this to happen.

928
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:32,167
Let's do whatever
needs to be done."

929
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,959
They're straight-up haters.

930
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:36,375
There is no reasoning
with them.

931
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:40,626
Some individuals who were
at the time in places

932
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:43,500
to make decisions
believe that the only reason

933
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:45,417
you deal with
these individuals is by

934
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,876
techniques like this.

935
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:48,959
If you deal with some
of the hardcore...

936
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:52,876
our detainees...they
might have become compliant

937
00:55:52,959 --> 00:55:54,876
and then maybe jovial
and engaging,

938
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:56,876
but if you ask them,
"What are you gonna do

939
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:58,125
if you ever get out?,"

940
00:55:58,209 --> 00:56:03,167
they'll go, "I'm gonna
come kill you, my friend."

941
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:09,459
All the information that
came from Abu Zubaydah

942
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:12,709
we got
before waterboarding.

943
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,250
Most of
these things came

944
00:56:14,334 --> 00:56:17,542
from traditional
interrogation techniques...

945
00:56:17,626 --> 00:56:19,417
by showing people
evidence.

946
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,125
by putting detainees
against each other,

947
00:56:21,209 --> 00:56:22,584
by pocket litter.

948
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,792
So the traditional
interrogation techniques

949
00:56:24,876 --> 00:56:26,542
worked tremendously.

950
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:30,709
We had the interrogators,

951
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:32,167
and we had the debriefers.

952
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:37,167
The interrogators would work
with the detainee.

953
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,626
And once they became
compliant,

954
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:44,500
they would step back
and the debriefers...

955
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:48,375
the targeting analysts,
the people who knew the most

956
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:50,083
about the target
would step in

957
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:53,959
and would begin
to question them.

958
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:58,083
Jennifer Matthews was there
sitting in front

959
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,542
of Abu Zubaydah,
asking him questions.

960
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,209
There is
a big difference

961
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:03,792
between being an expert

962
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:07,751
behind a desk and being
a field expert.

963
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:12,542
You can't argue
with success.

964
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:14,667
And the fact
of the matter is

965
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:17,000
that we were extremely
successful.

966
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:19,918
Once we started
using the techniques

967
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,334
on Abu Zubaydah and once
he became compliant,

968
00:57:26,417 --> 00:57:30,834
we started to collect
incredible intelligence.

969
00:57:30,918 --> 00:57:34,959
Abu Zubaydah gave us
the play book of how to go

970
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:36,792
after these individuals.

971
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:42,667
So in short order, every
chief of operations was

972
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:44,792
either captured or killed.

973
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:53,375
Ramzi bin AL-Shibh,
Nashiri, Hambali.

974
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:56,542
KSM. Remember that guy?
That was a nice one.

975
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:11,334
But they had him
in an Arab yuppie outfit.

976
00:58:11,417 --> 00:58:13,000
You know, he was looking
very prim and proper.

977
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,334
I'm like, Forget this.

978
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:16,250
I want every guy, bad guy,
downrange should know

979
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:17,959
what their future is.

980
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:19,375
This is their mack daddy.

981
00:58:19,459 --> 00:58:21,459
This is
their chief gangster.

982
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:26,334
This is your future.

983
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:28,375
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

984
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:30,042
was waterboarded
183 times.

985
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,584
They tried to quantify
the numbers

986
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,500
of pourings of water,

987
00:58:34,584 --> 00:58:38,626
and eventually the pourings
of water used

988
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:41,667
in waterboarding
became "times."

989
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:44,584
So 183 total pourings
of water

990
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:48,709
on Khalid Sheikh Mohammad
became 183 times,

991
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,083
which is crazy.

992
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,834
Look, it's not
FBI versus CIA.

993
00:58:52,918 --> 00:58:55,042
I know for a fact
that everything

994
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:58,542
that we've been told,
that resulted,

995
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:00,209
because of
waterboarding,

996
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:01,375
that's not true.

997
00:59:01,459 --> 00:59:02,626
Only three terrorists

998
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,250
with American blood
on their hands

999
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:05,584
were ever waterboarded.

1000
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:09,792
In many cases,
it was just a few days.

1001
00:59:09,876 --> 00:59:12,000
In the case of Abu Zubaydah
and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,

1002
00:59:12,083 --> 00:59:13,459
it was just a few weeks.

1003
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:15,167
This program evolved

1004
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,792
because, you know,
some of the stuff

1005
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:19,959
that they tried to do
is not working.

1006
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:24,667
And during the evolution
process, I realize

1007
00:59:24,751 --> 00:59:26,292
that we shouldn't be
part of this

1008
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:28,417
and...I shouldn't be even
a witness for this.

1009
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,000
And I put it
to our headquarters,

1010
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,876
and headquarters
pulled us out.

1011
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:33,584
We all knew Americans
would find out at some point

1012
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:35,125
about everything we
were up to.

1013
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:36,542
There were no illusions.

1014
00:59:36,626 --> 00:59:38,959
And so you have to try to
provide a lens of history

1015
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,250
that doesn't exist yet.

1016
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:42,209
I understand people are
uncomfortable with this,

1017
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:44,792
but the options
we had were not very good.

1018
01:00:20,292 --> 01:00:22,667
In the aftermath
of 9/11, people expected

1019
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:25,250
and realized he would
probably go to Tora Bora,

1020
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,417
which he did.

1021
01:00:31,459 --> 01:00:34,375
After Tora Bora, he more
likely than not went up

1022
01:00:34,459 --> 01:00:39,209
to Kunar and then somewhere.

1023
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:41,167
Well, it could
have been in...

1024
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,042
I always thought of him
as running around...

1025
01:00:43,125 --> 01:00:47,125
maybe
in the Afghan-Pak border,

1026
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:48,500
maybe even if Afghanistan.

1027
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:50,167
That's what my favorite
would have been...

1028
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:52,292
having him in Afghanistan,
because that was

1029
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:55,542
his spiritual home,
so to speak,

1030
01:00:55,626 --> 01:00:58,500
from the Afghan jihad.

1031
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:01,751
I was asked,
"Where is bin Laden,"

1032
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:03,250
all the time.

1033
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:08,542
When I went to testify
to the Congress,

1034
01:01:08,626 --> 01:01:10,000
the first thing they
wanted to know was,

1035
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,000
"Where is bin Laden?"

1036
01:01:14,626 --> 01:01:16,125
I went to the Oval Office
a number of times.

1037
01:01:16,209 --> 01:01:20,500
I was asked by the president
"Where is bin Laden?"

1038
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:24,959
Everybody
would ask the same question:

1039
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:26,292
"Where is bin Laden?"

1040
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:29,584
It was very frustrating to
basically have to admit

1041
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:31,751
that you didn't know.

1042
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,459
One time, one of my
colleagues came in to talk

1043
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,876
to me about,
"Where's bin Laden?"

1044
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:47,000
And I told him, "Look, you
know, I am so tired of this.

1045
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:50,042
"The next time that
the next person asks me,

1046
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,876
"'Where is bin Laden,'

1047
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:54,459
"I'm gonna say,
'You know what? Fuck you.

1048
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:56,709
Fuck you.'"

1049
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,918
And later that day,
I went home.

1050
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,667
And the first thing my wife
asked me when I get home is,

1051
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:10,292
"Where is bin Laden?
And why can't you find him?"

1052
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,751
The toughest
position to be in AL-Qaeda

1053
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:21,209
then was number three,
number four.

1054
01:02:21,292 --> 01:02:22,918
Because why?
You had to communicate.

1055
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,375
You had to communicate
to get attacks done.

1056
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:25,959
You had to communicate...
and if you were doing that,

1057
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,083
we're on you.

1058
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:30,876
Frankly, even though

1059
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:33,417
in the back of our minds,
we knew we had

1060
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,000
to get him some day,

1061
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:38,667
we were actually
too busy going after those

1062
01:02:38,751 --> 01:02:40,792
who were actually
plotting against us.

1063
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:45,709
Congratulations,
Abu Butthead.

1064
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:47,209
You're now number three
in AL-Qaeda.

1065
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:48,834
That's the good news.
The bad news is,

1066
01:02:48,918 --> 01:02:50,500
you're now number
three in AL-Qaeda.

1067
01:02:50,584 --> 01:02:52,000
You'd better buckle
your chinstrap

1068
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,542
because your
career path is

1069
01:02:53,626 --> 01:02:55,167
probably going
to be short-lived.

1070
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,667
There is an aspect
of the intelligence business

1071
01:03:01,751 --> 01:03:03,000
called targeting.

1072
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:06,083
I think this is a revolution
for a couple of reasons.

1073
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:08,876
Just in the past ten years,
the agency

1074
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:10,834
has transitioned
from strategic intelligence

1075
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:14,125
to tactical intelligence
that helps you identify

1076
01:03:14,209 --> 01:03:18,542
the movements and locations
of one specific individual.

1077
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:21,042
I'm not just worried about
what AL-Qaeda

1078
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:22,626
looks like strategically;

1079
01:03:22,709 --> 01:03:24,334
I want an analyst

1080
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:26,459
who's spending
all their time looking

1081
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:28,751
at one target
with one name...

1082
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,375
and people
whose whole goal in life

1083
01:03:32,459 --> 01:03:34,959
is following
one human being.

1084
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:50,209
I went to the other women
who had become

1085
01:03:50,292 --> 01:03:52,542
targeting officers
when I moved over...

1086
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:55,125
Jennifer Matthews
and some of the other women

1087
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,584
who had already paved
the way...

1088
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:58,083
just to ask them,
"How do I do this?

1089
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,751
I have to build this
from the ground up,"

1090
01:04:00,834 --> 01:04:03,500
kind of like they did
on the bin Laden side.

1091
01:04:03,584 --> 01:04:05,918
You know,
"How do I do this?"

1092
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,125
We still didn't have a great
technical tool to do that.

1093
01:04:09,209 --> 01:04:10,918
I built a spreadsheet.

1094
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,250
And when I reached out
to Barbara and Gina

1095
01:04:14,334 --> 01:04:15,918
and a few other women,
they just said,

1096
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,626
"That's how we do it.

1097
01:04:17,709 --> 01:04:20,334
Go for it. That's exactly
how you get it done."

1098
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:27,584
You're leaving
a digital trail every day.

1099
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:28,959
So are terrorists...

1100
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:30,209
when that person travels,

1101
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:32,250
when that person
gets on a phone,

1102
01:04:32,334 --> 01:04:35,292
when we get information
from a courier in AL-Qaeda

1103
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:36,584
about who he's touching

1104
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:39,083
and we bounce it against
information we might have

1105
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,209
found out two years ago.

1106
01:04:42,876 --> 01:04:45,125
They're looking at
a human terrorist in a field

1107
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,417
and they might send
a cable to a station

1108
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,459
that results in action
against that target

1109
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:51,292
the next day.

1110
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,959
Somebody who wants
in the fight.

1111
01:04:57,042 --> 01:05:00,083
That's what a targeter is.

1112
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:03,209
You have to intimately know
the target

1113
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:04,584
that you're going after,

1114
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:07,751
how you think that person
is gonna act, react,

1115
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:09,167
what they're gonna do
that day,

1116
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,918
what their strategy is,
who they're gonna talk to.

1117
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,375
What are their
priorities in life?

1118
01:05:13,459 --> 01:05:15,667
Is it wife number one,
is it wife number two?

1119
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:55,834
I was in Baghdad shortly
after the war started,

1120
01:05:55,918 --> 01:06:00,083
and it was kind of like
being in the Wild West.

1121
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:03,918
It was complete chaos.

1122
01:06:13,709 --> 01:06:15,709
Bin Laden was initially
excited about this.

1123
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:17,334
He was excited about Iraq.

1124
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:18,751
This is something he

1125
01:06:18,834 --> 01:06:20,792
couldn't, at the time,
pull off.

1126
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,626
So he was happy
to support the endeavor.

1127
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,459
He was such
a brutal terrorist.

1128
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,709
I just felt like we owed
it to the people of Iraq

1129
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:50,667
to remove him.

1130
01:06:56,709 --> 01:07:00,000
It seems so strange
that I never met Zarqawi.

1131
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:02,042
My former colleagues

1132
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,959
in the Jordanian
Intelligence Service

1133
01:07:04,042 --> 01:07:05,751
used to call him
my boyfriend.

1134
01:07:14,751 --> 01:07:17,542
I felt like I knew Zarqawi too well.

1135
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,042
He was a quiet guy...

1136
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:32,375
in a pathological
sort of way.

1137
01:07:32,459 --> 01:07:34,792
I mean, he was a monster.

1138
01:07:37,209 --> 01:07:39,751
There were calls at
2:00, 3:00 in the morning

1139
01:07:39,834 --> 01:07:40,918
from the group chief

1140
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,334
every time a bombing
happened,

1141
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:43,626
every time
he set off a VBID,

1142
01:07:43,709 --> 01:07:46,792
every time he targeted
a mosque or anything.

1143
01:07:49,709 --> 01:07:52,584
You know, I was
thinking about him 24/7,

1144
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:57,876
and it just wasn't
pleasant after a while.

1145
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:03,292
The model
to me is very clear.

1146
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:06,042
Our special forces,
our JSOC operators,

1147
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,542
their analysts,
our analysts,

1148
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,334
their operators,
our operators,

1149
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,000
were working hand-in-hand.

1150
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,584
They were downrange.

1151
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:15,000
They were downrange
in our field stations

1152
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,584
assisting in operations,

1153
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:18,751
bringing that expertise
there.

1154
01:08:18,834 --> 01:08:22,959
And the lessons
and the ability to take

1155
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:24,459
intelligence operations
combined

1156
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:29,000
with special operations
to create a synergy,

1157
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,334
a deadly synergy.

1158
01:08:30,417 --> 01:08:34,042
And your job
as a targeting officer

1159
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,626
in a war theater
is to help point

1160
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:39,292
boots on the ground
or something up above

1161
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:43,042
toward a target and be
as accurate as possible.

1162
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,667
Wait!

1163
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:55,417
For me, war is sort of like

1164
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,792
something radioactive
that you shouldn't touch

1165
01:08:57,876 --> 01:08:59,918
unless you've done
a tremendous amount

1166
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,542
of understanding of just
the damage that it will do.

1167
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,334
You can flirt with the idea
that "I can cross the line

1168
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:20,417
"and go into the dark side
and then I can walk back

1169
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,042
"because I'm going
in the dark side

1170
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,000
for a good purpose."

1171
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:27,709
And there are times when
that may be appropriate,

1172
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:30,083
but it is dangerous.

1173
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,292
It's easier next time
to cross.

1174
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:01,334
I did not like being
on the raids.

1175
01:10:01,417 --> 01:10:04,959
That wasn't...I was
an analyst.

1176
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:08,375
Wasn't...I just didn't...I...

1177
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:16,417
I think there are
questions

1178
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,167
about an intelligence
organization

1179
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:21,500
that slowly gets involved
in executing these types

1180
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,542
of global counterterrorism
operations.

1181
01:10:23,626 --> 01:10:25,334
That's a real
mind-set change.

1182
01:10:25,417 --> 01:10:28,667
The war was not
an agnostic video game.

1183
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:30,167
It was a personal game
where you know

1184
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,334
you're responsible

1185
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:32,918
not only for the lives
of Americans,

1186
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,042
but for going up
against an adversary

1187
01:10:35,125 --> 01:10:36,667
that you got to kill
or capture.

1188
01:10:36,751 --> 01:10:39,876
August of 2004,
I think we did 18 raids

1189
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:41,459
that month in Iraq,

1190
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:42,876
our force.

1191
01:10:42,959 --> 01:10:46,083
Two years later in 2006,
same month,

1192
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:48,250
Iraq, also,
we did 300 raids.

1193
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,334
Our ability to collect

1194
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:53,918
intelligence,
act on intelligence,

1195
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,709
and then collect more
intelligence had taken

1196
01:10:55,792 --> 01:11:00,918
an almost industrial
size and speed to it.

1197
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:07,918
It was definitely
a well-oiled machine.

1198
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,334
There were rolling raids.

1199
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:13,584
Sometimes
those were fruitful,

1200
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:14,959
and sometimes not so much.

1201
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,375
I think
sometimes the momentum

1202
01:11:16,459 --> 01:11:18,959
sort of overtook
the substance

1203
01:11:19,042 --> 01:11:20,542
of what we were going after.

1204
01:11:20,626 --> 01:11:21,876
You know, it's like,
"There's another target.

1205
01:11:21,959 --> 01:11:26,083
Let's go after it,
just because we can."

1206
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:27,792
The machine just kept going.

1207
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:34,459
We had executed thousands

1208
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:36,959
of these kinds of raids
in Iraq

1209
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,375
and Afghanistan,

1210
01:11:38,459 --> 01:11:41,000
and we got better
and better at them.

1211
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:48,209
So it was that evolution
in particular with the CIA

1212
01:11:48,292 --> 01:11:50,792
in ways that we
just couldn't have imagined

1213
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:54,834
in 2001 or 2002,

1214
01:11:54,918 --> 01:11:57,709
but were absolutely
critical, as it turns out,

1215
01:11:57,792 --> 01:12:00,292
in order to be able
to meet this threat.

1216
01:12:02,209 --> 01:12:04,042
But you
definitely need to know

1217
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:07,375
what your moral center is
and how you define that

1218
01:12:07,459 --> 01:12:10,417
for yourself in order
to be able to do that job.

1219
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,959
I mean, I worked in a center
where my job was to hunt

1220
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:16,083
a person down
to capture or kill.

1221
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:17,626
I mean, I had to be
OK with that.

1222
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:21,125
And, you know, the paradox
of wanting to save

1223
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:22,709
the women and children
of Iraq

1224
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:26,375
and kill someone
in order to do that

1225
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:28,834
wasn't lost on me
by any means.

1226
01:12:28,918 --> 01:12:30,709
But, you know, I...

1227
01:12:30,792 --> 01:12:32,876
I can justify that
for myself.

1228
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,500
The war on terror.

1229
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,500
How can you have
a war on terror

1230
01:12:43,584 --> 01:12:45,709
when terrorism is a tactic?

1231
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:47,292
You have a war
against people.

1232
01:12:50,125 --> 01:12:53,334
So the question
immediately becomes,

1233
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:54,876
Who are the people
that we're fighting

1234
01:12:54,959 --> 01:12:56,918
the war against?

1235
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,250
And I think still most
people don't understand

1236
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:04,667
why they hate us.

1237
01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:15,959
Some strikes are necessary,
but if our solution

1238
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:19,959
to this kind of problem is
to just strike

1239
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:22,209
without trying to take
effective efforts

1240
01:13:22,292 --> 01:13:25,375
to prevent the rise of
threats, it's endless.

1241
01:13:26,876 --> 01:13:29,292
Shock and awe does
not end wars on terrorism.

1242
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:32,542
It only creates
more terrorism.

1243
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:34,959
Money starts to flow
to terrorist groups,

1244
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:37,042
people become
more radicalized.

1245
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,709
Wars on terror
should be fought

1246
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:45,500
under the radar,
as quietly as possible.

1247
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:49,959
But counterterrorist
operations are,

1248
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:51,334
by their nature,

1249
01:13:51,417 --> 01:13:54,417
not very satisfying
to a frightened public.

1250
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:07,459
And we were working closely

1251
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,542
with the bin Laden unit,

1252
01:14:09,626 --> 01:14:11,792
and the dynamic of
the relationship

1253
01:14:11,876 --> 01:14:13,876
between Zarqawi
and core AL-Qaeda

1254
01:14:13,959 --> 01:14:15,834
sort of turned a lot
of assessments on

1255
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:18,626
what was happening with
core AL-Qaeda on its head.

1256
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:22,459
Bin Laden didn't know,
I'm sure, what he was

1257
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:24,000
getting into with Zarqawi...

1258
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,167
how fundamentally
different he was

1259
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,626
from some of his
other AL-Qaeda leaders.

1260
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:33,167
He did not have the same
academic background

1261
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:35,542
that a lot of
the AL-Qaeda scholars had.

1262
01:14:35,626 --> 01:14:37,959
He didn't have the same...

1263
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:41,459
for a lack of a better way
to put it...

1264
01:14:41,542 --> 01:14:45,250
professional sense
of jihad as AL-Qaeda did.

1265
01:14:45,334 --> 01:14:47,542
He didn't understand
the rules of the game.

1266
01:14:47,626 --> 01:14:50,042
He just thought
he could enact

1267
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,834
any strategy regardless
of how brutal it was.

1268
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:21,626
It was surprising
to hear

1269
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:24,459
that Zarqawi was not
being deferential.

1270
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:28,751
He was being insubordinate.

1271
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:51,500
Hassan Ghul was
an emissary from AL-Qaeda.

1272
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:56,876
He was actually
bringing over another letter

1273
01:15:56,959 --> 01:16:00,459
from AL-Qaeda central
to Zarqawi about

1274
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:03,083
how he should be conducting
operations in Iraq.

1275
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,459
When we realized
that Hassan Ghul

1276
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:10,250
would be traveling to Iraq,

1277
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:13,417
we decided this was
an opportunity for us.

1278
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,834
So we actually planned
an operation...

1279
01:16:15,918 --> 01:16:20,459
it was my team with our base
and the Kurdish government...

1280
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,584
to capture him.

1281
01:16:22,667 --> 01:16:25,584
And we definite...

1282
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,500
the Kurdish government
kept him, and we

1283
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:29,834
definitely gained a lot
of information out of him,

1284
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,542
including
Al-Kuwaiti's name

1285
01:16:31,626 --> 01:16:34,834
and the role that he
played with bin Laden.

1286
01:16:34,918 --> 01:16:36,334
Did that answer...

1287
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:37,834
Do you know how his name,

1288
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:41,125
Ahmed AL-Kuwaiti's,
came up?

1289
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:48,584
Within the course
of a debriefing

1290
01:16:48,667 --> 01:16:50,584
with the Kurdish
government,

1291
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:52,375
Hassan Ghul gave up
the name of Al-Kuwaiti,

1292
01:16:52,459 --> 01:16:54,542
the courier.

1293
01:16:56,042 --> 01:16:57,959
Ahmed from Kuwait.

1294
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:02,167
It was
significant information,

1295
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:07,292
even though we knew that
the pseudonym AL-Kuwaiti

1296
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,083
was a throwaways.

1297
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:11,125
I mean, who...
It's like saying

1298
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,417
"Jose the Puerto Rican,"
you know?

1299
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,792
It could be anybody.

1300
01:17:15,876 --> 01:17:19,000
The key is what
he told us about bin Laden

1301
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:21,292
not using any other
means of communicating.

1302
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:25,626
We asked
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed

1303
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:29,876
about the information
of the courier...

1304
01:17:29,959 --> 01:17:31,876
and he kind of just...

1305
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:33,584
He jumped back.

1306
01:17:33,667 --> 01:17:35,626
His body language
jumped back. He changed.

1307
01:17:35,709 --> 01:17:36,751
And he said, "No, no, no."

1308
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:40,959
Look, we all know,
even as little kids,

1309
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:43,792
if suddenly you react
and go, "No, no, no,"

1310
01:17:43,876 --> 01:17:45,375
it probably means
"Yes, yes, yes."

1311
01:17:45,459 --> 01:17:47,125
He had not been truthful.

1312
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,751
But later...and this
is the benefits

1313
01:17:49,834 --> 01:17:52,167
of having black sites...

1314
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,542
we intercepted
a communication from him

1315
01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:57,626
to some of the other
detainees.

1316
01:17:57,709 --> 01:18:00,751
He told his fellow
detainees not to say a word

1317
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:02,250
about the courier,

1318
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:05,209
thereby telling us
a lot about the courier...

1319
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,459
that he's of
tremendous importance

1320
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:11,584
and that we were
on to something.

1321
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:45,834
In late 2007,

1322
01:18:45,918 --> 01:18:48,375
the bin Laden cell
came to me.

1323
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,751
Some of these people
had been doing this

1324
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,542
well before 9/11.

1325
01:18:55,626 --> 01:18:57,542
I mean, they go all the way
back to Alec Station.

1326
01:18:57,626 --> 01:19:02,167
These people had spent
their lives on this target.

1327
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:06,792
They said, "We're going to
try another approach.

1328
01:19:06,876 --> 01:19:08,417
"It's got to be
the courier network.

1329
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,000
"We've got some information
on couriers.

1330
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:13,500
We're gonna begin
to build from that."

1331
01:19:20,334 --> 01:19:23,292
The way it works
is information comes in.

1332
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:25,167
You catalogue it,
you organize it.

1333
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:28,125
You know, that little
nugget there could sit

1334
01:19:28,209 --> 01:19:30,584
fallow on your shelves
for four or five years

1335
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:33,250
until something else comes
in that's suddenly

1336
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:35,500
very illuminating
about something that you

1337
01:19:35,584 --> 01:19:38,042
may have had for a very
long period of time.

1338
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:44,417
That actually happened
in the work

1339
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:47,542
we did to hunt
for Osama bin Laden

1340
01:19:47,626 --> 01:19:50,375
by trying to track
his courier.

1341
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:57,667
It took years
for the agency

1342
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,125
to recruit the human source

1343
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:02,459
that eventually gave us
the true name.

1344
01:20:03,918 --> 01:20:05,334
That's why we're
in the business

1345
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:08,918
of clandestine
human intelligence,

1346
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
because in many cases,
all these fancy gadgets

1347
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:15,209
and everything else

1348
01:20:15,292 --> 01:20:17,042
won't give you
the information

1349
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,876
that you really need...

1350
01:20:18,959 --> 01:20:21,250
a true name.

1351
01:20:21,334 --> 01:20:23,292
And we finally
got his true name...

1352
01:20:27,626 --> 01:20:29,083
which is whatever it is.

1353
01:20:30,209 --> 01:20:32,834
Whatever Arabic name,
you know?

1354
01:20:32,918 --> 01:20:36,876
But the true name,
we were able to find out

1355
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:38,626
a lot about him.

1356
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,500
From then on, you know,

1357
01:20:40,584 --> 01:20:42,751
the agency was able to do
what it does so well...

1358
01:20:42,834 --> 01:20:44,500
track the guy and find him.

1359
01:20:46,459 --> 01:20:47,876
Very soon after that,

1360
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:49,209
I briefed the President.

1361
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:51,042
I said, "I got to tell you,
Mr. President, my guys,

1362
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,500
"they seem a little
optimistic about this.

1363
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:55,500
They actually think
this could lead somewhere."

1364
01:21:12,626 --> 01:21:16,042
You're projecting
force and intelligence

1365
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:18,792
and assets
across that border.

1366
01:21:18,876 --> 01:21:21,834
And that's
what Khost represented.

1367
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:26,042
Their focus was across
over there in Waziristan,

1368
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:29,000
because that's where
the enemy was.

1369
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:41,042
Jen Matthews
was the chief of base,

1370
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:42,667
of the CIA base down there.

1371
01:21:42,751 --> 01:21:45,125
She was there
to have her fingers

1372
01:21:45,209 --> 01:21:47,709
right on the pulse
of the information

1373
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:50,334
that was coming
through the base.

1374
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:53,876
She never enunciated
that, so to speak,

1375
01:21:53,959 --> 01:21:56,209
in such stark terms,

1376
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:58,083
but my sense was she was

1377
01:21:58,167 --> 01:22:01,792
there to target and kill

1378
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:03,709
senior AL-Qaeda leaders.

1379
01:22:05,042 --> 01:22:08,209
I asked her, "Do you think
we're going to get him?"

1380
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:10,167
She smiled and said,

1381
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:14,083
"We'll get him eventually,

1382
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:15,876
and I hope
I'm a part of it."

1383
01:22:15,959 --> 01:22:17,584
So...

1384
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:37,292
He's not at all what
you'd expect as a radical.

1385
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:40,375
He's a doctor; he's working
in a refugee clinic.

1386
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:48,792
It turns out he had
this very dangerous hobby

1387
01:23:48,876 --> 01:23:50,083
on the side, which was
writing this blog

1388
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,667
and getting himself
in trouble.

1389
01:23:51,751 --> 01:23:53,209
Over a period of months,

1390
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:54,584
he becomes one of

1391
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:56,209
the most visible writers

1392
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:58,000
on the internet, and the CIA

1393
01:23:58,083 --> 01:23:59,667
and the Jordanian
intelligence

1394
01:23:59,751 --> 01:24:03,542
go all out to recruit
Balawi to be a spy.

1395
01:24:04,834 --> 01:24:07,000
Over several weeks,
they convince him

1396
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:08,542
to go to work for them.

1397
01:24:51,918 --> 01:24:54,626
Balawi finds
his way into Pakistan

1398
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:56,167
and essentially disappears.

1399
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,542
Very likely somebody
suspected him

1400
01:24:57,626 --> 01:25:00,334
as being an informant
and maybe cut his head off.

1401
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:05,542
Nobody hears anything from
Balawi for three months.

1402
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:08,834
Suddenly he's back
on the radar screen again,

1403
01:25:08,918 --> 01:25:11,876
and he's saying,
"I've gotten inside."

1404
01:25:11,959 --> 01:25:13,459
Balawi is a doctor.

1405
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:14,918
He is now beginning to treat

1406
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,125
the number two leader
of AL-Qaeda,

1407
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:19,083
Ayman AL-Zawahiri.

1408
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,000
When Balawi sends
this information

1409
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,959
to the CIA headquarters,
the place goes crazy.

1410
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:30,334
Even the White House
gets briefed.

1411
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:32,834
This young man, Balawi,

1412
01:25:32,918 --> 01:25:34,709
is gonna take us
right to number two

1413
01:25:34,792 --> 01:25:37,167
and maybe even
to number one.

1414
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,125
The meeting
has to take place

1415
01:25:47,209 --> 01:25:49,792
in a place where the CIA
can completely control

1416
01:25:49,876 --> 01:25:52,125
the environment,
and by default,

1417
01:25:52,209 --> 01:25:54,918
this becomes
the CIA base at Khost.

1418
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:57,500
It falls
to Jennifer Matthews

1419
01:25:57,584 --> 01:26:00,167
to come with a plan
to get Balawi

1420
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:04,000
inside this base at Khost
without being detected.

1421
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,042
Well, the problem is

1422
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:08,918
that nobody in the CIA
has ever met with Balawi.

1423
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,334
They make
arrangements for him to come

1424
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:17,834
into the base
without even being searched

1425
01:26:17,918 --> 01:26:19,334
or checked because
they're afraid

1426
01:26:19,417 --> 01:26:20,834
that somebody might
recognize him,

1427
01:26:20,918 --> 01:26:22,626
his identity might
be compromised.

1428
01:26:42,417 --> 01:26:46,834
People have been
too quick to blame Jennifer,

1429
01:26:46,918 --> 01:26:50,792
and that I reject totally

1430
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:52,792
because there were
many people

1431
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:54,500
looking at this operation.

1432
01:26:59,709 --> 01:27:03,083
People wanted
to believe that the source

1433
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:05,000
was good.

1434
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:16,584
There were also pressures
coming from the White House

1435
01:27:16,667 --> 01:27:18,209
and elsewhere, saying,
you know,

1436
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:21,417
"Pursue, pursue, pursue.
We need to do this."

1437
01:27:24,918 --> 01:27:28,209
I'm sure there were people,
voices out there saying,

1438
01:27:28,292 --> 01:27:30,167
"Uh, maybe not."

1439
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,250
"Maybe we should slow down."

1440
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:39,209
That happens
in many operations.

1441
01:27:41,751 --> 01:27:43,918
Didn't happen in this one.

1442
01:27:46,542 --> 01:27:47,918
So they set up
a plan to get him

1443
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,459
through the checkpoints
without being even looked at

1444
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:52,125
by the guards.

1445
01:27:53,834 --> 01:27:55,167
He gets further
into the base,

1446
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:57,667
goes through
a second checkpoint,

1447
01:27:57,751 --> 01:27:58,918
goes to a third checkpoint,

1448
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,876
and gets all the way
in to the innermost heart

1449
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:02,959
of the base,
the inner sanctum.

1450
01:28:08,417 --> 01:28:11,167
There are a total
of 14 CIA officers lined up

1451
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,626
to meet him.

1452
01:28:20,959 --> 01:28:22,542
Balawi gets out of

1453
01:28:22,626 --> 01:28:24,209
the car on the wrong side,

1454
01:28:24,292 --> 01:28:25,876
and he's chanting the words

1455
01:28:25,959 --> 01:28:27,834
in Arabic "God is great."

1456
01:28:27,918 --> 01:28:29,542
Before anyone
could stop Balawi,

1457
01:28:29,626 --> 01:28:31,292
he fumbles
for his detonator.

1458
01:28:38,459 --> 01:28:40,292
You will be sent
to the hell.

1459
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:42,042
Balawi hits a switch,

1460
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,334
blows himself up, and
there's a terrific explosion

1461
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:47,918
that kills almost everybody
who's within direct sight

1462
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,751
of Balawi at the time
of the explosion.

1463
01:28:49,834 --> 01:28:52,000
We heard the explosion,

1464
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:53,918
but when we saw
the smoke coming up

1465
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,292
from exactly where I knew
Chapman was,

1466
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:59,042
then I knew the base
had been hit.

1467
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,626
We knew that someone
had gotten

1468
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:01,959
inside the base,

1469
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:03,709
and we knew that
it was the agency

1470
01:29:03,792 --> 01:29:05,667
that had been hit.

1471
01:29:05,751 --> 01:29:07,584
And we knew it was bad.

1472
01:29:13,792 --> 01:29:16,500
By the time we got
on the scene,

1473
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:20,292
it was an ugly scene.

1474
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:23,042
There were, you know,
parts everywhere.

1475
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:25,876
The conventional unit
that was there landed...

1476
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:29,542
the helicopter right
in the courtyard

1477
01:29:29,626 --> 01:29:32,709
and evaced as many of
the wounded as possible.

1478
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:38,375
You know, he said
Jen didn't make it.

1479
01:29:38,459 --> 01:29:39,542
Uh...

1480
01:29:43,876 --> 01:29:46,584
Her logistics chief
that we had worked with

1481
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:50,918
to close the base on a daily
basis didn't make it.

1482
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,292
And some of
her case officers

1483
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,209
never made it even
back to...you know,

1484
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:59,125
they died on the scene.

1485
01:30:07,626 --> 01:30:10,667
When you do this
and do this and do this,

1486
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:14,250
eventually you lose one.

1487
01:30:14,334 --> 01:30:15,792
And we lost...

1488
01:30:15,876 --> 01:30:18,667
and we lost
really good people.

1489
01:30:25,584 --> 01:30:28,417
When I heard that
Jennifer was in Khost...

1490
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:33,375
I was shocked that she...

1491
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:40,250
was taken out by bin Laden.

1492
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:42,250
I mean, that was just...

1493
01:30:42,334 --> 01:30:44,417
that just seemed so surreal

1494
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,125
that that would happen
to her.

1495
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:50,000
You know, after she spent so
many years trying to prevent

1496
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:52,626
another tragedy by him,

1497
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:54,292
You know, he, in effect,

1498
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:56,125
had anything
to do with her death,

1499
01:30:56,209 --> 01:30:58,125
it's incredibly
disheartening.

1500
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:05,042
There was some
criticism of the agency.

1501
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:07,083
Frankly, I understand that.

1502
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:10,626
But you don't get
Abbottabad without Khost.

1503
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,876
An agency that's not willing
to take the risks that were

1504
01:31:16,959 --> 01:31:18,542
evident at Khost,

1505
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:21,626
which unfortunately
ended tragically...

1506
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:25,792
that agency, if it's not
willing to do that

1507
01:31:25,876 --> 01:31:28,667
is not an agency to do
what it had to do

1508
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:32,834
to build that trail
all the way to Abbottabad.

1509
01:31:32,918 --> 01:31:37,500
In fact, some of
the human beings who built

1510
01:31:37,584 --> 01:31:41,417
the trail to Abbottabad were
actually killed at Khost.

1511
01:31:44,292 --> 01:31:48,375
It was kind of Team America
in the hunt for bin Laden

1512
01:31:48,459 --> 01:31:50,292
and the fight
against AL-Qaeda.

1513
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:53,709
And there is powerful
connective tissue

1514
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:55,500
between the two events.

1515
01:35:42,959 --> 01:35:44,918
The hunt
for the courier to bin Laden

1516
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,542
makes complete sense to me.

1517
01:35:47,626 --> 01:35:51,584
It was based on all of these
years of experience working

1518
01:35:51,667 --> 01:35:53,125
with a very tight-knit
group of people

1519
01:35:53,209 --> 01:35:55,834
who really cared about this
and supported each other.

1520
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,918
We invented the technique
that works,

1521
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,918
and it's the technique that
got bin Laden in the end.

1522
01:36:06,959 --> 01:36:09,959
I got a call from another...
a former colleague,

1523
01:36:10,042 --> 01:36:14,000
and he said,
"Turn on the news."

1524
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:15,459
You know, I was at home.

1525
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:16,751
"Turn on the news.

1526
01:36:16,834 --> 01:36:18,959
The President's going
to make an announcement."

1527
01:36:19,042 --> 01:36:23,000
And I had a feeling
that it's been a good day

1528
01:36:23,083 --> 01:36:24,542
at the office...

1529
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:30,626
Good evening.

1530
01:36:30,709 --> 01:36:34,667
And then finally it's him.

1531
01:36:34,751 --> 01:36:37,500
They got him.
They got him finally.

1532
01:36:43,709 --> 01:36:46,626
That was...yeah,
that was really something.

1545
01:37:22,918 --> 01:37:24,417
that it needs to

1546
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:27,209
to understand what it
is we just went through.

1547
01:37:27,292 --> 01:37:30,584
The really key part is not
how to do these operations;

1548
01:37:30,667 --> 01:37:31,792
the thing to understand is,

1549
01:37:31,876 --> 01:37:34,292
why are the people
that we are fighting

1550
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:35,751
doing what they're doing?

1551
01:37:35,834 --> 01:37:38,542
Why is the enemy the enemy?

1552
01:37:39,834 --> 01:37:42,209
If you don't understand why
they're doing it,

1553
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:44,417
it's very difficult to stop.

1554
01:37:47,918 --> 01:37:49,876
We don't speak
the language enough.

1555
01:37:49,959 --> 01:37:51,709
We don't understand
the culture enough.

1556
01:37:51,792 --> 01:37:57,417
We haven't taken the time to
not be blind, deaf, and dumb

1557
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,667
in areas of the world
that matter to us.

1558
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:30,167
It's a nice chapter
to close,

1559
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:32,500
nice chapter to close.

1560
01:38:33,751 --> 01:38:35,584
It's not over.

1561
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:37,667
Sadly enough, I think
we're gonna

1562
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:40,042
be in this situation again.

1563
01:38:44,751 --> 01:38:47,042
Bin Laden achieved,
you know, spreading

1564
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:51,334
his ideology beyond what he
probably expected it to.

1565
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:54,500
How do you kill an ideology?

1566
01:38:54,584 --> 01:38:56,959
Killing one person doesn't
end that.

1567
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:01,334
I don't like it.

1568
01:39:01,417 --> 01:39:02,834
I don't want it to continue.
I hope it stops.

1569
01:39:02,918 --> 01:39:04,125
I hope we don't live
in a world

1570
01:39:04,209 --> 01:39:05,667
where you deal
with an adversary

1571
01:39:05,751 --> 01:39:08,250
that loses respect for
the sanctity of human life.

1572
01:39:08,334 --> 01:39:09,834
But, look,
this isn't a picture

1573
01:39:09,918 --> 01:39:11,334
from a video arcade.

1574
01:39:11,417 --> 01:39:14,834
This is a human being who
has a family and a soul.

1575
01:39:14,918 --> 01:39:18,584
So when you confront that,
what are you gonna do?

1576
01:39:19,918 --> 01:39:22,542
There are philosophical
debates you can have,

1577
01:39:22,626 --> 01:39:24,250
but at the end of
the day, the question is:

1578
01:39:24,334 --> 01:39:26,709
Are you gonna move
or not? Yes or no?

1579
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:28,792
Go or no go? That's it.
