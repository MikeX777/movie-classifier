1
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,436
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
good afternoon from the flight deck.</i>

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,480
<i>We're cruising at 37,000 feet,</i>

3
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:18,315
<i>and we just passed over the coast.</i>

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:20,901
<i>We'll be beginning our descent
in about 30 minutes.</i>

5
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:23,779
<i>I'd like to take this opportunity
to welcome you to America.</i>

6
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:35,809
<i>Copy, 45.</i>

7
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:37,603
Hey!

8
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:38,646
What's up?

9
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:41,649
-Up against the wall.
-What's the problem?

10
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:43,942
-Back up.
-Up against the wall!

11
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:46,445
-Hey, take it easy, all right?
-Against the wall!

12
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:49,448
Spread your legs.

13
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:50,449
Spread them!

14
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,370
-What are you doing in my neighbourhood?
-I live here, all right?

15
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:55,913
Yo. Yo.

16
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:56,997
She's blue.

17
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:04,505
Sorry about that. We're looking for someone
that matches your description. You know how it is.

18
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:08,092
Yeah, I know how it is.

19
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,723
You must be new.

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,559
Have a nice day.

21
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,543
Rough morning there, slugger?

22
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,921
Yeah, you don't know the half.

23
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:30,674
This hasn't been the friendliest of homecomings.

24
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:32,217
Oh, yeah?

25
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:35,179
Come on, cheer up.

26
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:39,141
Every day on God's green earth
is a great day.

27
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:41,852
Especially when you carry a gun
and you got a bullet-proof vest.

28
00:03:43,187 --> 00:03:44,146
Hey.

29
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:56,575
You done primping?

30
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,078
Can we go?

31
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,245
Hang on a second.

32
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,749
See? Now I'm ready.

33
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,104
Still so hard to see it like this.

34
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:28,774
These all used to be homes.

35
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,652
Yeah, nature can be a real bitch.

36
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:36,490
Kingston Manor.

37
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:38,534
Just wondering who still lives there.

38
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:39,702
Bad people.

39
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:41,870
No, not all of them.

40
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:43,580
I remember a lot of good families

41
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:48,043
just, you know, stuck in an unfortunate situation.

42
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:50,754
Five-0!

43
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,721
-Five-0!
-Well, if they were unfortunate before,

44
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:00,681
they're straight-up screwed now.

45
00:05:00,764 --> 00:05:02,641
You don't ever want to get caught in there.

46
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:05,311
Girl, you've been gone a long time.

47
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,814
We don't even respond to calls
from in there anymore.

48
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:11,525
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.

49
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:26,165
All right, I need a coffee.

50
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:45,100
You're black and sweet, right?

51
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:47,311
-That's gonna get old, Kev.
-No.

52
00:05:47,394 --> 00:05:49,438
No, you're gonna learn to love it. You'll see.

53
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,157
-Finally. You here about the break-in?
-Actually, no.

54
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,576
Don't even worry about it.

55
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,828
Called you guys over 24 hours ago.

56
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,748
<i>Officers have been charged with stealing evidence,</i>

57
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,709
<i>filing false police reports and extortion.</i>

58
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:14,380
<i>The New Orleans DA worked with Internal Affairs
to build their case.</i>

59
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:18,217
<i>Details are still under wraps
while the investigation is ongoing.</i>

60
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,512
<i>The DA assures us that
there are more arrests to come.</i>

61
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,231
Hey.

62
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:34,441
Can you do any tricks on that thing?

63
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:39,446
-I didn't steal it or nothing.
-I never said you did.

64
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:43,367
-How long you had it?
-Been having this a couple years.

65
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,577
-Couple years?
-Jamal, get your ass over here.

66
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:50,457
-Shit, man.
-Talking to the goddamn police. Jamal!

67
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,793
Did you not hear me say get your ass over there?

68
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:56,463
-Ma'am, he didn't do anything. I was just talking to--
-I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to my son.

69
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:58,132
Jamal, get your ass in the car.

70
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:00,634
Can you get your ass over there? Go! Now!

71
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:04,513
-He wasn't doing anything. I just--
-I wasn't talking to you. Now, is there a problem?

72
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:06,807
When are you gonna start
listening to your mama, man?

73
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,852
No, we don't have a problem, ma'am.
You want to make a problem?

74
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,895
You tell me. You're talking to my son.

75
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:13,480
Everything all right?

76
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:16,400
Yeah, everything's good,
besides these dudes not doing they jobs.

77
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:17,735
If you need anything, just holler.

78
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:18,694
-I know.
-All right?

79
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,487
Appreciate you, bro. Appreciate you.

80
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,989
Punk-ass cop.

81
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,205
-I'm asking you.
-I'll tell you the problem.

82
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:31,749
Why your little man ain't in school?

83
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:35,210
Eat me, Mouse, okay? And take your ass back to work.

84
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:36,670
Ghetto ass.

85
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:38,756
Go lift them boxes.

86
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,049
What's good, bro?

87
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,971
-Yo, what's up?
-This cop here is harassing Jamal.

88
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:49,350
-I wasn't harassing anybody.
-You got a problem, officer?

89
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:50,809
Everything's just fine.

90
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,686
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm totally sure.

91
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:03,030
Missy?

92
00:08:03,864 --> 00:08:05,908
It's me, Licia.

93
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,369
-You know her?
-No, no. You got me confused.

94
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,621
-Alicia West.
-Look, I said you're mistaken.

95
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:12,915
Now, we good? Can we go?

96
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,208
Officer?

97
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:16,877
Yeah, you good.

98
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:20,756
Uncle Tom-ass bitch.

99
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,757
What you say?

100
00:08:24,426 --> 00:08:25,678
Yeah, all right.

101
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:32,893
Keep an eye on that bitch.

102
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:33,936
All right.

103
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:00,963
Everything all right?

104
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,131
Yeah.

105
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:05,843
Listen.

106
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:07,094
They were Kingston Crew.

107
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,471
Watch it with those guys.

108
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:12,975
Come on.

109
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,607
Mouse?

110
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:24,653
-To some.
-It's Alicia.

111
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:27,865
-I was a friend of your cousin Missy.
-I know who you is.

112
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:30,117
It's been a long time.

113
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:34,580
What's up with Missy? That was cold.

114
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:36,123
I don't know.

115
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:37,750
You gotta talk to her about that.

116
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,835
She got her own shit going on.

117
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,963
She got a son now?

118
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:46,175
For 10 years.

119
00:09:47,384 --> 00:09:49,428
Yeah. Jamal.

120
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:51,430
He's a good kid.

121
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:54,224
-He didn't mean no disrespect.
-I was just talking to him.

122
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,268
-That's all.
-All right, let's roll, partner.

123
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:57,394
Thank you.

124
00:10:00,898 --> 00:10:02,191
How much do we owe?

125
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:03,317
Don't worry about it.

126
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,568
Oh, no, that's all right.

127
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:06,362
Cops don't pay.

128
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:07,738
You're good.

129
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:27,967
-What, did he say something to you?
-Can we just go?

130
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,095
You know him?

131
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,721
Guess not. Not anymore.

132
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:40,938
Copy that.

133
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,315
Oh, Jesus. You're still here?

134
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,525
Give her the chair, man.

135
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:46,568
Let a real cop
do some work for a change, huh?

136
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:49,071
Hey, it's your mom's site, Jennings.

137
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:52,866
-You want to kill her traffic?
-I'm just happy that the old broad's back in business.

138
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,284
<i>Twenty-three 45.</i>

139
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,920
Where's the fire?

140
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:07,381
It is date night.

141
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:11,635
Tina's mom's gonna watch the kids.
Got us a room at the Brixton,

142
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,345
and I don't want to miss one second.

143
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:14,972
Yo, Jennings.

144
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:18,225
-Yeah?
-Need someone to pull a double. Your name came up.

145
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:19,768
Come on, sarge.

146
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:21,520
It's date night.

147
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:23,772
Do me a solid. Can you find somebody else?

148
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:25,691
Look, I got four guys out tonight.

149
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:28,861
Okay? You're not the only badge
with a family, Jennings. Come on.

150
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,615
-I'll take his spot.
-You're riding with Deacon Brown. Meet him in the lobby.

151
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:35,075
Okay.

152
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,578
Hey. Thank you.

153
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,620
I owe you one.

154
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:39,997
It's fine.

155
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,291
-I ain't got no plans.
-Well, I do.

156
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,126
You know how long I've been on the force?

157
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,628
They don't know nothing. You ask me questions,

158
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:49,089
I answer them, and you still don't know.

159
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,592
It doesn't make any sense.
I'm the oldest cat in the room.

160
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,969
-Deacon Brown?
-Oh, Deacon!

161
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,263
Deacon? Who are you?

162
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:57,389
I'm riding with you.

163
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:03,062
-Where's Jennings?
-He got family commitments.

164
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,440
I'm Alicia West. Nice to meet you.

165
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:09,443
Look at this rook, man.

166
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:12,655
Those guys narcs?

167
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:15,741
Yeah.

168
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:17,993
You're new.

169
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:20,287
Bye, Deacon.

170
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,751
Actually, this is my third week.

171
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,336
Oh, a whole three weeks.

172
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,213
You pull a night shift yet?

173
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:31,507
-No, sir, not here.
-Not here?

174
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,300
-Where were you before?
-Kandahar.

175
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:34,969
Oh, a vet.

176
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,762
How long you been out?

177
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:37,972
Little over a year.

178
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:41,767
My brother was killed in the first Iraq.

179
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,810
What a waste.

180
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:46,355
You really got to wear that thing?

181
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:48,023
Why? You got something to hide?

182
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:52,152
You better get used to them.
We're all gonna be wearing them soon.

183
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:54,571
Just don't point it at me.

184
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:03,247
<i>Any available unit, there's a 10-40 at Bar 1631.</i>

185
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,915
<i>Suspect possibly armed.</i>

186
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,667
<i>Dispatch, this is car 421.</i>

187
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,584
<i>We're on it.</i>

188
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:10,713
<i>One twenty-nine. Go ahead.</i>

189
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:14,425
-Put your hands down!
-What you say, son?

190
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:15,926
Why you got to put your hands in my face?

191
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,138
-Boy... Man, back up.
-Don't put your hands in my face! Don't touch me.

192
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:29,356
Hey, yo!

193
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,276
-Yo! Back up! Back up!
-I told you to move.

194
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,736
I need you to back up!

195
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:35,112
Back up! Hey!

196
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:36,447
Hey, back up! Hey!

197
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,282
Sir! Sir!

198
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:40,075
I need you to calm down, all right?

199
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,493
Tell me what's going on here.

200
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:42,995
-I'm calm.
-What's going on?

201
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,580
Take it easy, okay?

202
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:45,748
Calm down.

203
00:13:45,831 --> 00:13:46,915
-I'm calm.
-All right?

204
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:48,042
I'm calm, Miss Officer.

205
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,002
-Tell me what's going on, sir.
-Wait, look.

206
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,256
-Why are you throwing punches, sir?
-Look.

207
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,091
I ain't throwing no punches.

208
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:59,219
I swear, no punches.
I'm trying to have a good time with my girl.

209
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:02,014
You're out with your girl,
you don't need to be throwing punches.

210
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:05,809
-I ain't throwing punches. I swear. I ain't.
-So why are you throwing punches?

211
00:14:05,893 --> 00:14:07,519
I swear. Look, Miss Officer...

212
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:11,649
What you doing?
You out here trying to get some tonight, or what?

213
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:14,526
What you doing? You want to be like that tonight?

214
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,655
You want to be like that? Get it down!
Get that head down!

215
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:21,408
-What you doing, man? Stay on the hood!
-Man, you ain't shit!

216
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,285
-Hands on the car!
-You know who I am?

217
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:24,703
Put your head down, man!

218
00:14:24,787 --> 00:14:26,205
-What you got?
-Brown.

219
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:28,332
-What you got?
-Brown, that is not necessary.

220
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:30,918
-Where your homeys at, huh? What'd I tell you?
-Pussy cop!

221
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,086
I said stay down!

222
00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:34,338
Hey, man, I'm gonna pop you right here.

223
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,464
That's enough!

224
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:36,757
Brown! That is enough!

225
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,134
-Stop it, man!
-Let me tell you to stay still again.

226
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:40,803
That is enough! Stop it!

227
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:44,181
Stop! That is not necessary!

228
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:46,350
That is enough! Stop it!

229
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:49,770
That had your name on it.

230
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:54,733
Get your hands down.

231
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,363
You're out here trying to catch a bullet tonight, huh?

232
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:01,865
-You're trying to get some.
-What you doing, man? Let me go!

233
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,523
Look, about what happened out there...

234
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:37,443
I'm sorry I...

235
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,029
Sorry?

236
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,576
Sorry will get your ass killed out here.

237
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:50,831
Let me ask you a question You think you're black?
You think they're your people?

238
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:52,124
Well, they're not.

239
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,084
We are.

240
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:56,628
You're blue now.

241
00:15:58,088 --> 00:15:59,423
Don't you ever forget that.

242
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:02,551
You understand me?

243
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,099
-Yeah.
-You better.

244
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:20,027
This is Brown.

245
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,324
Now?

246
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:27,743
Yeah.

247
00:16:31,246 --> 00:16:32,414
We got to roll.

248
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,292
-Everything all right?
-We got a call. Let's go.

249
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:36,710
What, on your phone?

250
00:17:36,353 --> 00:17:38,647
I still don't understand what we're doing here.

251
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:40,858
I got to meet a C.I.

252
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:45,446
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?

253
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:47,072
Stay in the car and close the door.

254
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:50,075
-Why?
-Because I said so.

255
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,086
Just stay in the car. I'll be right back.

256
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,619
Are you kidding? With me right here?

257
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,373
Hey!

258
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,372
You ain't got to worry about nothing.

259
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:42,790
Just let me do this.

260
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:54,593
Look, let me handle this.

261
00:20:54,677 --> 00:20:56,512
Let me run point on this.

262
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:58,806
We can't make any sudden moves right now.

263
00:20:58,889 --> 00:20:59,932
It's hot out there.

264
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,022
The DA's not gonna find out anything.

265
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:10,567
We managed to make all the deliveries
and keep the payment schedule.

266
00:21:10,651 --> 00:21:12,069
Right. According to you.

267
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:14,571
I've been loyal to you.
It's been coming down for months.

268
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:16,699
I have not said one thing.

269
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:18,534
Malone, listen to me.

270
00:21:18,617 --> 00:21:21,954
-I'm listening.
-This train's moving too fast for you to put the brakes on it.

271
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:24,873
Nobody needs to know what you've done here.

272
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,167
Look, you have nothing to worry about.

273
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:31,755
There's no way I would ever tell Darius.
You already got rid of everybody that can talk.

274
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,142
That's right, Zero.

275
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:45,185
I got rid of everybody that can talk.

276
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,063
What are you doing? I thought I told you
to stay in the car. What are you doing here?

277
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:49,690
Whoa, this isn't what it looks like.

278
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:51,233
Just relax. Where you going?

279
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:53,235
Put the gun down. These are bad guys.

280
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,570
This is not what it seems.

281
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:55,529
Just relax.

282
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:07,416
-What the hell did you do?
-She had a body cam on!

283
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:13,547
So you shoot her?

284
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:15,966
-You shoot her?
-She was gonna run!

285
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,426
-What did you want me to do?
-What'd I want--

286
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:21,305
-I didn't use my service weapon!
-Go, go, go! Go get it. Go get the body cam. Idiot!

287
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:37,488
-Who is she?
-West.

288
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:39,907
-Who's West?
-She's a rookie.

289
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,409
You bring a rookie here? Are you out of your mind?

290
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,495
-So, what are we gonna do now?
-Nothing changes.

291
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:46,622
-Nothing. You understand me?
-We just shot a cop!

292
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:49,083
Shut your mouth!
Nothing changes. We plant the guns.

293
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:53,045
You and the rookie rolled up on the Triple-Nines.
They capped her. You got away. It's simple.

294
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:54,963
-So, what about her body cam?
-What about the body cam?

295
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,841
Triple-Nines took the body cam for evidence. It's simple.

296
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,760
Stay with me. You understand?

297
00:23:01,136 --> 00:23:03,597
-I don't know about this.
-You don't know? Look at me, son.

298
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:05,140
You keep it simple. It tracks.

299
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:07,643
We're good. You go help him find your partner.

300
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:09,770
Go. Go. Go!

301
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:12,940
-Yo, we got a problem, Malone!
-You see her?

302
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,241
Hey!

303
00:23:23,951 --> 00:23:24,952
Smitty!

304
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:27,204
-Yo, we've got a ghost!
-What?

305
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:28,664
She's gone!

306
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:29,999
She's unarmed!

307
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:31,875
Her gun is here!

308
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:32,876
Find her!

309
00:23:45,431 --> 00:23:47,474
Come on. Damn it.

310
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:52,479
West!

311
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:59,028
Just come on out!
Just make it easy for us, all right?

312
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:01,822
We just want the body cam, all right? That's it.

313
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:02,990
I mean, what are you?

314
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:04,867
You some kind of stuntwoman or something?

315
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,578
Why don't you come out now?

316
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:13,500
They weren't supposed to shoot you.
All we want is the body cam.

317
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,977
Now come on out, rookie.

318
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:40,319
Why don't you come on out
and let us get you taken care of.

319
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:41,737
Okay? I'm sure that hurt.

320
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,118
Dispatch. Dispatch.

321
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:51,121
Shots fired. Officer needs backup.

322
00:24:51,205 --> 00:24:52,873
This is a code 108.

323
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:55,209
<i>Where is your location?</i>

324
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:59,046
<i>Dispatch, this is Detective Terry Malone.</i>

325
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:01,131
<i>-Is that you, Charlene?
-Sure is.</i>

326
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:04,343
<i>Oh, we got a rookie
who just witnessed a gang-related 187,</i>

327
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:05,844
<i>and she freaked out a little bit.</i>

328
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:09,098
<i>I'm gonna take care of this, all right?
Let me take this one.</i>

329
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:11,100
<i>Sounds good, Terry.</i>

330
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:12,893
<i>I got plenty other calls to take.</i>

331
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:16,772
<i>Okay, darling. Thank you.</i>

332
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:17,856
Dispatch?

333
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:20,526
Dispatch.

334
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:25,489
Damn it, Charlene. This is-- This is a 108.

335
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:27,658
<i>Hey, West. She's gone, you hear me?</i>

336
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:30,244
<i>West?</i>

337
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:33,122
Seems to me you got a hard choice
to make right now, darling.

338
00:25:34,123 --> 00:25:36,750
<i>Are you one of us, or are you one of them?</i>

339
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,377
Bring me that body cam.

340
00:26:10,117 --> 00:26:11,493
Malone!

341
00:26:14,913 --> 00:26:15,998
Malone, alley!

342
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:21,545
Stop!

343
00:27:31,156 --> 00:27:32,408
Help!

344
00:27:34,326 --> 00:27:36,412
Help! Hello!

345
00:27:36,495 --> 00:27:39,164
-I know you're in there. I need help.
-Bitch, get off my porch.

346
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:48,090
Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am.

347
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:50,634
Please.

348
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:53,095
-Oh, hell no. What...?
-Ma'am, please.

349
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:54,847
Ma'am, can I use your phone? Please.

350
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,807
-Can I use your phone, please?
-Officer, what's the problem?

351
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,267
-Please, I've been shot.
-You got a warrant?

352
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,060
-Sir, can I use your phone?
-Officer, what's the problem?

353
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:02,813
Please, please, please.
There are people chasing me. Please!

354
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:04,440
And you gonna bring that shit to my door?

355
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:07,818
-You don't understand! I'm being chased! Please!
-I don't care!

356
00:28:07,901 --> 00:28:09,486
You have to take that somewhere else. You got to go.

357
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,740
-Can't help you. No.
-Please! There are people-- Please! I need--

358
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:17,161
West!

359
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,247
Get your ass over here!

360
00:28:21,915 --> 00:28:24,209
She went through there! Come on, she's down there!

361
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,855
-You see her?
-No, I mean, she was--

362
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:46,106
-She was here.
-I know she--

363
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,192
-Where is she now?
-I don't know!

364
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,736
-You see her? What do you mean?
-I lost her. I lost her!

365
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:52,655
Are you kidding me?
Are you guys kidding me?

366
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:55,157
I just chased her for blocks.
I don't know where she went!

367
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,868
Jesus Christ. I don't believe--
You guys are amazing.

368
00:28:57,951 --> 00:29:00,496
-He had eyes on her!
-Shut up! You brought her. You shot her.

369
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:03,540
I got to clean this shit up! This is great.

370
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:05,417
Go to a private channel. Go to 19.

371
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:07,711
Dispatch has heard
enough of this shit already, okay?

372
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:11,924
Spread the word. She cannot get back to the precinct
with that camera. Do you hear me?

373
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,176
-Shake your head! Okay.
-I understand. Yes.

374
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,262
You tell everybody. You widen the search. Go. Go.

375
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,223
-Go. Shut up.
-Do your goddamn job, man.

376
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:21,266
You brought the rook.
What are you doing?

377
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,644
Get in the car. You're like a kid.

378
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,591
<i>I know she's here.</i>

379
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,093
<i>I know it.</i>

380
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:57,761
<i>Just circle the block one more time.</i>

381
00:30:07,896 --> 00:30:09,398
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

382
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:10,649
<i>No, nothing over here.</i>

383
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:12,359
<i>She couldn't have gotten far.</i>

384
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,527
<i>Let's circle back.</i>

385
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:29,543
Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Stop!

386
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:30,461
Stop!

387
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:34,298
Easy. Easy.

388
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:38,469
-What's your name? Identify yourself, please.
-I'm Officer West. I need a ride to the precinct.

389
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:39,887
Let me get you some help.

390
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,890
-All right? This is Sergeant--
-No, don't! Stay off the radio, please.

391
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,767
Relax. It's fine.

392
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,143
It's fine, all right?

393
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:48,062
Are you okay? You look like hell.

394
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:49,438
Where's your ride at?

395
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:53,108
It's-- It's a long story.

396
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:54,276
All right, come on.

397
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,153
Let's go. Let's get you out of here.

398
00:30:57,696 --> 00:30:58,656
Are you injured?

399
00:30:59,948 --> 00:31:01,075
Come on, we got you.

400
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,452
All right? Come on. Everything's gonna be fine. Come on.

401
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:07,915
<i>This is Brody. We found West. We got her.</i>

402
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,167
<i>She's at Second and Danneel.</i>

403
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,086
It's all right. We got you.

404
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:15,631
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?

405
00:31:17,716 --> 00:31:19,927
West. Hey. Don't be stupid, West.

406
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,845
All he wants is the body cam.

407
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:42,032
Damn it!

408
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:05,597
We're closed. We open at 8.

409
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:28,620
Hello?

410
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:40,966
Hello.

411
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,057
I'm telling you right now,

412
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:50,851
if I got to come back there...

413
00:32:51,685 --> 00:32:53,395
I'm gonna beat your ass.

414
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:07,076
I keep telling them about this door, man.

415
00:33:10,663 --> 00:33:12,915
Mouse, it's me. It's me. It's me.

416
00:33:12,998 --> 00:33:14,208
What the hell is going on?

417
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:18,545
-Is that blood?
-I need sugar.

418
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,965
Look, I don't know what's going on,

419
00:33:21,048 --> 00:33:22,841
but you can't be in here.

420
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:24,927
You need to get out of my store.

421
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:29,515
-I've been shot.
-What? What do you mean?

422
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:31,809
-Can I use your phone?
-Who shot you?

423
00:33:31,892 --> 00:33:33,268
Can I use your phone?

424
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:35,771
You got to go.

425
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,275
I don't want no part to this.

426
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:43,320
You need to go back outside
with all this bullshit, okay?

427
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:46,991
The police is riding around here all the time.
They'll help you.

428
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:50,202
-It was the cops that shot me.
-The cops?

429
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:51,453
Please.

430
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:56,083
I just need to call my partner
and stop the bleeding, and I will go.

431
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,043
I swear.

432
00:33:58,585 --> 00:33:59,628
Please.

433
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:08,971
-What happened?
-She got away.

434
00:34:09,054 --> 00:34:10,639
We hit the block a couple of times.

435
00:34:10,723 --> 00:34:12,224
-She's gone.
<i>-Available units,</i>

436
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:15,311
<i>we have a possible 211
in progress at a market.</i>

437
00:34:15,394 --> 00:34:17,187
<i>Corner of St Claude and Andry.</i>

438
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:20,941
That's not far. Oh, and we can't have anyone else
sniffing around down here.

439
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,818
Now, you guys go now. You understand?

440
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:26,280
-Yeah.
-1692 en route to possible 211.

441
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:27,948
<i>Copy, 1692.</i>

442
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:44,048
-Hello.
-Kev, it's me.

443
00:34:44,131 --> 00:34:45,633
<i>Jesus, West.</i>

444
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,551
-I need you, man.
<i>-Date night, remember?</i>

445
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:51,096
-Tina's in the shower right now. She's soaping up.
<i>-I'm being serious, Kev.</i>

446
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,766
Yeah, no shit. So am I.
Told you she's been doing yoga, right?

447
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:57,436
I saw narc officers murder some kids this morning.

448
00:34:58,354 --> 00:35:00,189
I got the whole thing on body cam.

449
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:04,568
Hold on a second. You're saying you--
You filmed a police shooting?

450
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:06,737
No, Kev, I filmed an execution.

451
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:09,406
Jesus. Where's Brown?

452
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,866
He's with them.

453
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,576
Man, a load of others too. They...

454
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:16,830
They're trying to kill me, man.

455
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,375
-Please. I need you. I got to get out of here.
<i>-Yeah, okay.</i>

456
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,376
All right...

457
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,045
Where's here?

458
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,092
West? Where are you right now?

459
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,388
<i>I'll meet you at 12th and Felicity Street.</i>

460
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,264
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

461
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:37,476
All right, all right. Just hang tight, partner.
All right? I'm there in 30.

462
00:35:40,396 --> 00:35:41,230
Shit.

463
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,192
Thanks.

464
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:51,615
I'm sorry.

465
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,496
-How'd they find me?
-They didn't. It was me.

466
00:35:57,579 --> 00:35:59,415
Please. Please. You got to hide me.

467
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:01,417
-You got to hide me. Please.
-Look, I don't...

468
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,253
I can't do this.

469
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:05,254
Please.

470
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:10,759
Open the door.

471
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:17,057
One second. It's me. I called y'all.

472
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,143
It's me. One second.

473
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:21,729
-Open the door.
-Yeah.

474
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:26,150
-Yeah, I'm the one who called y'all. Appreciate y'all coming.
-Back up.

475
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:27,901
-What?
-What took you so long?

476
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,862
-You alone?
-I'm the one who called y'all.

477
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:33,073
Police! If there's anybody in the store,
identify yourself now.

478
00:36:44,877 --> 00:36:47,254
Sir, it was me that called y'all, all right?

479
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,922
Turn around. Hands on the counter.

480
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,132
Turn around.

481
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:52,217
Turn around. Hands on the counter.

482
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,721
Come on. Spread your legs. Spread your legs.

483
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,684
I'm the one who called y'all, sir.

484
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,815
-Any sharp objects, needles, knives I need to know about?
-No, sir.

485
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:11,236
-What's up with all the aggression, man?
-Hey.

486
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,988
What did you just say to me?

487
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,240
Keep your mouth shut.

488
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:16,950
Nothing.

489
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:20,162
That's what I thought.

490
00:37:20,245 --> 00:37:21,372
Running your mouth.

491
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:26,710
I could blow your head off right now.

492
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:28,587
No one would even care.

493
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,219
Anything going on back there?

494
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:36,804
Nah. We're clear.

495
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,682
Check his ID.

496
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,314
I am so tired of coming into this neighbourhood.

497
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:55,364
You need to learn when to keep your mouth shut
and listen when an officer's talking to you.

498
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:56,865
You understand me, boy?

499
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:10,587
What do you got? Anything?

500
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:11,797
-Nothing. Nothing.
-Really?

501
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,340
-He's clean.
-All right.

502
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:15,801
I guess that makes you free.

503
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:20,889
Now...

504
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:25,519
What was it you wanted to tell me so badly?

505
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,857
That no one's here.

506
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,277
I thought I heard a noise in the back.

507
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,571
I got spooked.

508
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:38,866
Just wanted a little backup.

509
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:52,129
You know, wasting police time is a criminal offence,
but I'm gonna let you slide.

510
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:54,965
This time.

511
00:38:56,884 --> 00:38:58,135
I'll be watching you.

512
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,933
You think she was here?

513
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,186
Call Malone. Let's clear the store.

514
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,701
Sorry.

515
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,162
I didn't do it for you.

516
00:39:27,706 --> 00:39:29,249
I won't stay long, all right?

517
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,960
I just need to close this wound, okay?

518
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,463
You need to go to the hospital.

519
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:36,715
You got a needle and thread?

520
00:39:38,717 --> 00:39:39,969
I don't know.

521
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:41,011
How about glue?

522
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,430
You got some glue?

523
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:45,307
You're gonna glue it?

524
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:48,477
You got a better idea?

525
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,604
She gonna glue it.

526
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,331
It's all I have.

527
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:12,084
Thanks.

528
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:18,007
Where'd you learn how to do that?

529
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,383
Afghanistan.

530
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:20,342
The Army?

531
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:27,391
So that's where you went.

532
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,686
Did you really get footage on your body cam

533
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,604
of them cops killing them boys?

534
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,066
Yeah.

535
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:38,527
So, what you gonna do?

536
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,071
I'm gonna get it into evidence and expose them.

537
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,052
God.

538
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,484
Damn.

539
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,235
That worked.

540
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,992
So how are you gonna get to your partner?

541
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:29,119
I'm gonna walk.

542
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:31,413
Unless you got a ride I can use.

543
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:34,166
I don't have a ride.

544
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,963
I walk here, a couple blocks.

545
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:41,715
Dauphine Arms.

546
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,426
Then I'm stuck with plan A.

547
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:50,724
I got something for you.

548
00:42:01,694 --> 00:42:03,070
You need to stay on the low.

549
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,613
Put this on.

550
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:06,073
Less conspicuous.

551
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:09,368
Thank you.

552
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:14,081
Why are you doing this?

553
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:18,252
Why don't you just give it to them?

554
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,212
Come on.

555
00:42:20,295 --> 00:42:22,047
You're police. They're police.

556
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,675
Murder's murder.

557
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:26,844
Don't matter who you are.

558
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:07,176
Jesus.

559
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:17,811
-You all right?
-Just drive.

560
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:19,855
Just drive.

561
00:43:28,781 --> 00:43:31,659
-Jesus, we got to get you to a hospital.
-No, no, I'm good. I'm good.

562
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,286
I need to upload this footage first.

563
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:37,831
-The Fifth?
-No. Somewhere else.

564
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,084
All right, so talk to me.
What the hell happened?

565
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,336
I was rolling with Brown.

566
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:45,589
He got a call on his cell, and next thing I know,

567
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:47,299
we're at some abandoned power plant,

568
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:51,178
and there are narcs killing what I can only assume
were drug dealers.

569
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:55,766
They tried to kill me, Kevin.

570
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,686
Holy shit.

571
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:04,233
All right.

572
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:06,944
So, what are you gonna do?

573
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:11,198
I'm gonna upload the footage,

574
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,534
and once it's in the system, I'll call I.A.

575
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:17,371
-I.A.? No, no, no.
-Or the Feds. Whoever deals with stuff like this.

576
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:20,624
Slow down. Think about that, all right?
That's gonna make you a rat.

577
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,585
-So?
-All right, just think about it for a second.

578
00:44:23,669 --> 00:44:25,254
You want to can Malone's ass?

579
00:44:25,337 --> 00:44:27,589
Fine. I mean, get him and Smitty off the street,

580
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:29,508
yes, but have the captain do it, all right?

581
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:31,302
Nice and quiet. You bring in I.A.,

582
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:33,595
and, I mean, your career's over.

583
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:36,223
There's not a blue in the city
that's gonna have your back.

584
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:50,988
How do you know it was Malone and Smitty?

585
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,114
What?

586
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:56,201
-You just named them. How do you know?
-I don't know. I mean, you must have said.

587
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:58,412
No. No, Kev.

588
00:44:58,912 --> 00:45:01,290
-I said "narcs."
-Jesus. Come on.

589
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:03,917
Partner, look at me, all right? It's me.

590
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:12,468
All right, take it easy.

591
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,720
All right? Look at me. Take a breath.

592
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:16,472
It's me. All right?

593
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:18,265
-Pull over.
-We're almost there.

594
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,975
-Pull over!
-Jesus Christ.

595
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:25,105
Are you armed?

596
00:45:26,649 --> 00:45:27,941
I was.

597
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:28,984
Put it in park.

598
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:30,986
-Empty your pockets.
-Come on...

599
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,613
Empty your pockets. Come on.

600
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,908
-You are making a monumental mistake.
-No, I don't think so.

601
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:39,953
Where were you taking me, huh? To Malone?

602
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,665
-Jesus, I'm taking you to the Fourth.
-Oh, bullshit!

603
00:45:42,748 --> 00:45:44,833
-Why did Malone murder those kids?
-I'm not--

604
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:46,377
I'm not saying shit.

605
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,586
-Yes, you are.
-No.

606
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,505
-I'm asking you why.
-And I'm telling you

607
00:45:49,588 --> 00:45:52,174
I am not saying shit. Goddamn it!

608
00:45:52,257 --> 00:45:53,676
I am not playing with you, Kevin.

609
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:56,011
-All right? I will shoot you!
-All right. All right!

610
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,643
He didn't murder them. Okay? He silenced them.

611
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,979
-What are you talking about?
-They're his sellers.

612
00:46:07,356 --> 00:46:10,359
Look, every drug bust, Malone splits the take.

613
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,279
Half goes into evidence, half back on the street.
That's how it works.

614
00:46:14,363 --> 00:46:16,281
-So why kill them?
-Have you seen the news?

615
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:19,618
The chief, the mayor,
they're cracking down right now.

616
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:22,413
Six cops just got busted last month.

617
00:46:23,205 --> 00:46:26,083
Malone's cleaning up the shit
before the spyglass turns on him.

618
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:28,544
Jesus.

619
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:31,672
Hey, come on. Those guys...

620
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:33,507
they're no great loss.

621
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,135
You don't get to make that call.

622
00:46:39,054 --> 00:46:40,681
Why is he stopped?

623
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:41,974
What's he doing?

624
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,603
Holy...

625
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:09,251
You lying piece of shit.

626
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:12,004
No. No.

627
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:13,881
No, West.

628
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,759
West, run, and I can't help you!

629
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,271
Mouse.

630
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,568
What the hell are you doing here?
How the hell do you know where I live?

631
00:48:16,652 --> 00:48:17,987
Dauphine Arms.

632
00:48:18,654 --> 00:48:19,488
You told me.

633
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:22,783
I have got nowhere else to go.

634
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:25,744
They gonna kill me if I stay out there.

635
00:48:26,578 --> 00:48:27,579
Uncle Milo.

636
00:48:28,414 --> 00:48:29,498
-You all right?
-Jamal.

637
00:48:29,581 --> 00:48:31,166
Go back inside.

638
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,251
I'm good.

639
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:34,795
Why would you bring this shit here?

640
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,714
Why don't you take this shit to your door?

641
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,882
Hey. I know you.

642
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:40,968
You're that cop from the store.

643
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,304
Jamal, where is your mom?

644
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:45,806
-She's working.
-She's working.

645
00:48:49,101 --> 00:48:50,144
Go back in, man.

646
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:07,244
What happened to your partner?

647
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,873
-He's not gonna help.
-Didn't want to cross his boys in blue, huh?

648
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:13,417
-He's a coward.
-You just gullible and blind.

649
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,335
You know what?

650
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:18,255
I am sick of this "them versus us" bullshit!
I don't have to choose.

651
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:21,216
All right? I'm a person. You're a person.

652
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,553
Those kids I saw murdered
this morning were people.

653
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,472
Nice speech.

654
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,892
I'll make sure I put it on your headstone.

655
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:31,810
So, what exactly are you saying?

656
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,272
Because Zero and his guys weren't cops,
I shouldn't care?

657
00:49:37,024 --> 00:49:38,067
Did you just say Zero?

658
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,735
-Yeah.
-Y'all shot Zero?

659
00:49:39,818 --> 00:49:42,571
-You know him?
-This shit just went up a level.

660
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:45,366
Mouse, I just need to stay here till dark,

661
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,201
and then I'll go, I promise you.

662
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,118
All right?

663
00:49:49,578 --> 00:49:50,621
Please.

664
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:58,170
-Cap.
-Malone.

665
00:49:58,253 --> 00:50:00,881
-What the hell happened here?
-We got a big problem.

666
00:50:01,548 --> 00:50:04,426
Turf war, Triple-Nines and the Kingston Crew.

667
00:50:05,094 --> 00:50:06,845
Brown rolled up with the rookie.

668
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,807
She got trigger-happy. She shot a kid.

669
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,433
Now she is in the wind.

670
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:17,856
You're telling me West killed a kid
and now she's a ghost?

671
00:50:18,524 --> 00:50:19,692
Yeah.

672
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:22,736
Problem is, it wasn't just a kid.

673
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,071
It's Darius Tureau's nephew.

674
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,990
That's a problem.
Why didn't you call it in?

675
00:50:26,073 --> 00:50:28,033
-Captain, it wasn't that...
-I told him not to.

676
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:29,910
My guys got to find her, captain.

677
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:33,664
I don't know if you've seen the news lately,
but our department is under the microscope.

678
00:50:33,747 --> 00:50:36,041
I.A. is looking for any excuse.

679
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:38,210
Cap, I'm all over it, okay?

680
00:50:38,293 --> 00:50:41,547
We're looking for her on the QT.
They find out she's out there alone,

681
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,340
she's dead. She won't live the night.

682
00:50:46,302 --> 00:50:47,928
You got to let me handle this.

683
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,723
You bring the jacket?

684
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:01,984
-How'd you let this happen?
-She panicked, captain.

685
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:04,278
I want you back at the station
as soon as possible.

686
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,613
I want details on everything
that happened here.

687
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:09,408
Real details from you. Not from him.

688
00:51:13,454 --> 00:51:14,663
Let me handle this.

689
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,412
Sir. Sir.

690
00:51:56,664 --> 00:51:58,290
Let him through.

691
00:51:58,374 --> 00:51:59,208
Go ahead.

692
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,676
Darius.

693
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:10,761
Malone.

694
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:14,890
Where he at?

695
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,685
Let me see him.

696
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:32,157
-He wanted to go ahead and get it done as quickly as we can.
-I hear you.

697
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,376
Now what are you doing?

698
00:52:44,837 --> 00:52:45,921
We need her dead.

699
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,340
We're running out of time.

700
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:58,392
Don't touch the body.

701
00:53:05,357 --> 00:53:07,651
I raised this boy like he was my own.

702
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:09,486
He's like a son to me.

703
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,823
-A hell of a job you did.
-Put a muzzle on your dog, Malone.

704
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:14,575
-All right.
-Before I put him down.

705
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,659
All right.

706
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:18,620
Can I at least close his eyes?

707
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:21,832
No, no, you can't touch him, man.
The guys at the lab got to do their job.

708
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:33,010
Tell them not to waste their time.

709
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:36,639
We all know who did this.

710
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,558
Don't we, Malone?

711
00:53:39,642 --> 00:53:40,643
Who?

712
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:43,312
Triple-Nines.

713
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,358
Officially.

714
00:53:52,488 --> 00:53:54,198
Unofficially, it was a cop.

715
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,409
A cop?

716
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:03,957
Why are you telling me this?

717
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,252
Because this rookie is a liability...

718
00:54:07,836 --> 00:54:09,713
and we don't need to go to war over her.

719
00:54:10,756 --> 00:54:11,590
It's a bitch?

720
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,759
Yeah.

721
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:18,472
I want all of her info, Malone.

722
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,474
You hear me?

723
00:54:31,777 --> 00:54:32,778
Hey, yo, D.

724
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:36,156
You gonna believe what Malone said?

725
00:54:39,994 --> 00:54:42,079
White boy never lied to us yet.

726
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:46,458
I want that bitch dead.

727
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:48,669
Now.

728
00:54:49,545 --> 00:54:50,671
It's done.

729
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:51,797
Put everybody on it.

730
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:03,744
Yo, let me ask you a question.

731
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,913
How could you not get the camera?

732
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,915
-I tried.
-Shut up.

733
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:10,668
Who is she? Let me see.

734
00:56:11,251 --> 00:56:13,629
Alicia West from the Ninth Ward.

735
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,048
In and out of juvie.

736
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:18,384
Joined the Army when she was 17.

737
00:56:18,926 --> 00:56:20,427
Two tours in Afghanistan.

738
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:22,012
-Jesus Christ.
-You know that?

739
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:23,931
Did you know that?

740
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,849
-She said she was in the Army.
-Yeah.

741
00:56:25,933 --> 00:56:27,685
Graduated the academy with honours.

742
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:30,229
No family, no kin,

743
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:32,022
no emergency contact.

744
00:56:32,106 --> 00:56:33,983
Woman is a ghost.

745
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:38,028
She gets that camera back to the police station,
each and every one of us is going to prison.

746
00:56:38,112 --> 00:56:38,988
You understand me?

747
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,116
This is your fault. Why'd you bring her here?

748
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:45,160
I should drop you right now,
you stupid son of a bitch.

749
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:46,745
You kidding me?

750
00:56:48,288 --> 00:56:49,248
You.

751
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:53,085
Did you let her go? Did you let her go?

752
00:56:53,168 --> 00:56:54,503
-No. No.
-You didn't let her go?

753
00:56:54,586 --> 00:56:56,630
What else you know about her
that's not in those papers?

754
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:58,882
-I don't know. I don't know.
-What else? What else?

755
00:56:58,966 --> 00:57:01,260
Friends. She got a guy she's banging?
She got somebody?

756
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:03,095
-Say something!
-All right.

757
00:57:03,178 --> 00:57:05,973
Look, I don't know, man!
Look, I would tell you, all right?

758
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,226
Come on. You know that I would tell you.
The only person that I've ever seen

759
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:12,021
that she even maybe knows is this guy at this market.

760
00:57:15,733 --> 00:57:16,817
That market, is it...

761
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,111
St. Claude and Andry?

762
00:57:20,112 --> 00:57:21,488
Yeah. How'd you know that?

763
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,949
There's nothing out there.

764
00:57:24,825 --> 00:57:26,368
When's the last time you slept?

765
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,121
I don't remember.

766
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:32,333
You should probably get some rest.

767
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:33,751
It's gonna be dark soon.

768
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,170
You got to leave out.

769
00:57:40,299 --> 00:57:41,467
Can I ask you something?

770
00:57:43,886 --> 00:57:45,095
Why did I become a cop?

771
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:48,140
Yeah.

772
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,436
I was gone a long time.

773
00:57:53,228 --> 00:57:55,439
Lived in a lot of different places, and...

774
00:57:55,814 --> 00:57:58,400
after a while, I stopped seeing enemies or allies.

775
00:57:58,484 --> 00:57:59,943
I just saw people.

776
00:58:00,736 --> 00:58:02,571
Not good, not bad. Just...

777
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:05,824
folks trying to figure life out like I was.

778
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:10,496
And then, after my mom passed...

779
00:58:11,497 --> 00:58:14,458
and I was here, home...

780
00:58:19,254 --> 00:58:20,381
I just wanted to help.

781
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,008
Food banks and inner-city programmes help.

782
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:26,053
These cops out here...

783
00:58:28,222 --> 00:58:29,264
not so much.

784
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:32,685
We're just animals to them.

785
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,650
Shit's got to change.

786
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,154
Get some sleep.

787
00:58:54,623 --> 00:58:56,333
Got the video footage set up right here.

788
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:58,168
Everything's queued up.

789
00:59:01,672 --> 00:59:03,048
All right, play it.

790
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:08,887
-Who is that?
-It's Milo Jackson.

791
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:10,806
Mouse. He works here in the mornings.

792
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:12,975
Go ahead, fast-forward.

793
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:16,520
Stop.

794
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,736
Mouse?

795
00:59:25,154 --> 00:59:26,155
I want his address.

796
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:28,782
Yeah.

797
00:59:34,413 --> 00:59:35,414
We good?

798
00:59:36,332 --> 00:59:38,959
Triple-Nines say the streets
are ours till dawn.

799
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:45,299
A cop.

800
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:47,384
Yeah, well, it was still Zero. You dig?

801
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:54,475
Let's go.

802
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:03,150
D.

803
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:07,488
I want to help. Zero was family to me too.

804
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:22,628
The way you can help me is by staying alive.

805
01:00:23,295 --> 01:00:25,589
Look here. I can't lose you both.

806
01:00:25,673 --> 01:00:26,757
You hear me?

807
01:01:07,214 --> 01:01:08,340
Drop it!

808
01:01:09,925 --> 01:01:12,219
-Drop it!
-Jamal!

809
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,972
-What the hell are you doing?
-She killed Zero.

810
01:01:15,055 --> 01:01:16,849
-What?
-I didn't kill anyone.

811
01:01:16,932 --> 01:01:18,309
She's lying. Everybody knows.

812
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:22,271
Give me that, man.
What are you doing, brah?

813
01:01:22,354 --> 01:01:23,480
She killed Zero. Look.

814
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:31,280
-Where'd you get that from?
-Darius.

815
01:01:33,032 --> 01:01:33,907
Darius Tureau.

816
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:35,409
You got a price on your head.

817
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:39,580
This photo's probably all over the city.

818
01:01:41,332 --> 01:01:43,292
-Malone.
-Who did you call?

819
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:47,463
I'm asking, did you tell anybody she was here?

820
01:01:59,975 --> 01:02:02,853
-What address? What's the address?
-It's Dauphine Arms.

821
01:02:03,562 --> 01:02:04,897
Should be two streets up.

822
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:10,319
-Let's find this bitch, man.
-Hey, remember what I told you, okay?

823
01:02:10,402 --> 01:02:11,779
-Yeah. Strap up.
-Let's go.

824
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,031
Let's do this. Come on.

825
01:02:14,114 --> 01:02:14,948
Let's go.

826
01:02:27,628 --> 01:02:30,381
-This gun ain't even loaded.
-We got to move. He's here.

827
01:02:30,464 --> 01:02:32,549
Go to the apartment now, and lock the door.

828
01:02:32,633 --> 01:02:35,594
Now! What do you mean, we got to go?

829
01:02:37,805 --> 01:02:39,640
Malone is here, all right?

830
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:42,476
He hasn't traced me. He's connected you.

831
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,355
So you're either with me, or you can stay
and get a bullet in your head. You choose.

832
01:04:06,852 --> 01:04:07,770
It's empty.

833
01:04:07,853 --> 01:04:09,647
You know, maybe she didn't come here.

834
01:04:10,773 --> 01:04:12,274
We need to get out the hood.

835
01:04:12,941 --> 01:04:14,735
Is there anyone you trust with a car?

836
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:18,364
That's that bitch right there.

837
01:04:18,447 --> 01:04:19,281
Come on!

838
01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:39,176
Drop the gun! Drop it! Drop it!

839
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:44,556
Alicia!

840
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:51,313
Mouse?

841
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,274
Mouse?

842
01:04:56,902 --> 01:04:57,861
Mouse!

843
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,120
Mouse?

844
01:05:10,499 --> 01:05:11,917
-You all right?
-Yeah.

845
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:17,548
There's a church back there.

846
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,968
There's a pastor in there that I know.

847
01:05:21,427 --> 01:05:23,762
He's good people. He's got a ride.

848
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:28,767
-Just go, and I'm gonna meet you there.
-You're hurt. I ain't leaving you.

849
01:05:28,851 --> 01:05:31,270
Alicia, listen to me.
We got to get out of the Ninth.

850
01:05:31,353 --> 01:05:34,732
That car won't run,
and my leg is messed up, okay?

851
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:37,860
I'm not gonna make it over this gate.

852
01:05:37,943 --> 01:05:39,653
I don't want to slow you down.

853
01:05:41,196 --> 01:05:42,573
I need you to trust me.

854
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:45,909
It's my hood.

855
01:05:45,993 --> 01:05:48,162
Just go over the gate,
and I'm gonna meet you there.

856
01:05:49,455 --> 01:05:51,373
I know what's moving out here.

857
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:52,875
Trust me.

858
01:06:00,382 --> 01:06:01,634
Go!

859
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:03,010
Go now!

860
01:06:22,404 --> 01:06:23,405
-Get him!
-Get in!

861
01:06:23,489 --> 01:06:25,824
-Get the fuck in the truck.
-Get in the truck!

862
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:02,546
I'm telling you, she didn't do nothing.

863
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:11,221
Where is she?

864
01:08:11,305 --> 01:08:12,931
I told you.

865
01:08:13,015 --> 01:08:14,099
Where's the cop?

866
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:15,100
I don't know.

867
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:20,731
Nigga, if you don't start talking soon,

868
01:08:20,814 --> 01:08:22,941
Ox here is gonna start
taking pieces off your ass.

869
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:25,194
You like your ear, Picasso?

870
01:08:27,446 --> 01:08:29,573
-Van Gogh.
-What'd you say?

871
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:31,659
Van Gogh chopped off his ear.

872
01:08:33,869 --> 01:08:34,995
You dumbass.

873
01:08:38,207 --> 01:08:39,667
I like this nigga.

874
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:40,834
He's smart.

875
01:08:42,753 --> 01:08:45,214
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second, D.

876
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:46,882
Let me have a word with this fool.

877
01:08:54,932 --> 01:08:56,558
Come on, Mouse.

878
01:08:56,642 --> 01:08:57,977
Why are you protecting her?

879
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,354
She don't care about your black ass.

880
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:05,067
-Looks like you got her all wrong.
-Oh, so she got your head all turned around?

881
01:09:06,652 --> 01:09:08,153
She ain't one of us.

882
01:09:08,237 --> 01:09:09,405
She picked her side.

883
01:09:09,488 --> 01:09:11,782
Mouse, you don't owe her nothing.

884
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:13,242
You're wrong about her.

885
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:17,663
-But she killed Zero.
-No, she didn't.

886
01:09:17,746 --> 01:09:19,498
Missy, enough.

887
01:09:35,556 --> 01:09:37,224
That's all you got, pussy?

888
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,769
Round two, bitch.

889
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:02,291
This is Alicia West. I'm a police officer, and...

890
01:10:02,374 --> 01:10:04,126
this body cam contains footage

891
01:10:04,209 --> 01:10:06,420
of narc officers murdering civilians.

892
01:10:08,213 --> 01:10:11,592
If you find it, please turn it in to the FBI.

893
01:10:13,469 --> 01:10:14,345
Thank you.

894
01:10:32,863 --> 01:10:34,990
<i>Girl, you've been gone a long time.</i>

895
01:10:35,074 --> 01:10:37,284
<i>We don't even respond to calls
from in there anymore.</i>

896
01:10:37,368 --> 01:10:39,119
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.

897
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:42,373
<i>Not unless there's a blue in trouble.
Not unless there's a blue in trouble.</i>

898
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:52,758
Yo, who that?

899
01:11:07,314 --> 01:11:09,858
-I'm just saying, we're gonna be there anyway.
-I don't know.

900
01:11:11,068 --> 01:11:13,237
Yo, that's that bitch that killed Zero, man.

901
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:16,949
-Yo, it's her.
-Yeah, that's her!

902
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:21,745
Somebody get that bitch!

903
01:11:30,462 --> 01:11:32,673
Somebody make the call.

904
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:34,091
Oh, hell no.

905
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:40,055
Somebody bury that bitch!

906
01:11:54,528 --> 01:11:57,865
-Get your ass out of here!
-Somebody's gonna die today!

907
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:58,991
Yo.

908
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,336
Somebody take down that bitch right there!

909
01:12:12,254 --> 01:12:13,547
I got your ass.

910
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:20,638
Kingston Crew all day, bitch!

911
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:31,482
Hey, yo, D.

912
01:12:33,108 --> 01:12:34,652
You're not gonna believe this.

913
01:12:37,112 --> 01:12:38,656
This dumb bitch is here.

914
01:12:47,706 --> 01:12:50,167
-Dead girl walking.
-Bitch, what you doing, huh?

915
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,026
I didn't do it. I didn't...

916
01:13:20,447 --> 01:13:23,784
I didn't kill your nephew, all right?
It was Malone! It was Malone!

917
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:26,203
-It was Malone! It was Malone!
-Shut your lying mouth.

918
01:13:26,286 --> 01:13:29,331
My body cam. I
filmed the whole thing on my body cam.

919
01:13:29,415 --> 01:13:32,501
Okay, that's why Malone wants me dead.
He's using you, all right?

920
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:42,386
-Body cam?
-Oh, this is bullshit. She don't have a camera.

921
01:13:43,762 --> 01:13:45,806
Bitch, you're telling me
Malone killed my nephew?

922
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:48,851
-Yes, yes, he did!
-Yo, this bitch is lying, homey.

923
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:50,728
Why am I here if I'm lying?

924
01:13:53,272 --> 01:13:54,189
Where's the body cam?

925
01:13:54,273 --> 01:13:56,191
-I stashed it.
-Where?

926
01:13:58,402 --> 01:13:59,403
Show me Mouse...

927
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:02,781
and I promise you I'll give you the body cam.

928
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:05,034
I promise you.

929
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:25,679
I showed you mine.

930
01:14:25,763 --> 01:14:27,056
Now show me yours.

931
01:14:35,356 --> 01:14:38,108
-What's going on?
-Something big's going down at Kingston Manor.

932
01:14:44,698 --> 01:14:46,659
-Yeah.
<i>-Hey, Malone, it's Brown.</i>

933
01:14:46,742 --> 01:14:48,619
Listen, man, King's got West.

934
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:51,455
All right.
That's good news, isn't it?

935
01:14:51,538 --> 01:14:53,123
I don't think you understand.

936
01:14:54,792 --> 01:14:58,087
-The captain's sending in the cavalry to get her.
-Shit.

937
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,465
Dead or alive.

938
01:15:01,548 --> 01:15:05,177
If they get their hands on that body cam,
Malone, we gonna have problems.

939
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,595
Yeah. I hear you. I hear you.

940
01:15:10,641 --> 01:15:15,104
Look, she's got to get back to the precinct
to download the information from that camera, okay?

941
01:15:15,187 --> 01:15:18,190
-We just got to get the camera.
-And you know what this means, Malone?

942
01:15:18,273 --> 01:15:20,317
We cannot let Darius get this information.

943
01:15:20,401 --> 01:15:21,986
-Do you understand me?
-I understand.

944
01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:25,364
-We'll be fucking dead. We'll be dead.
-Son of a bitch.

945
01:15:28,075 --> 01:15:28,993
We got to go.

946
01:15:30,285 --> 01:15:32,621
Now! What you waiting for?

947
01:15:32,705 --> 01:15:33,622
Let's go.

948
01:16:04,862 --> 01:16:06,780
I wondered if I'd see your face.

949
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,910
Look what they did to me, Missy.

950
01:16:13,329 --> 01:16:15,331
You saw what they did to Mouse.

951
01:16:15,414 --> 01:16:16,582
And you're still here?

952
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:19,251
That's your fault, not mine.

953
01:16:19,335 --> 01:16:22,171
Right. Because this
is where I wanted to be right now.

954
01:16:22,254 --> 01:16:23,922
What, you think you better than me?

955
01:16:24,006 --> 01:16:27,801
No, I don't think I'm better than you,
but you have a son, Missy.

956
01:16:27,885 --> 01:16:29,303
What you even doing here?

957
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:32,222
Don't act like you know me.

958
01:16:32,931 --> 01:16:34,475
You haven't lived my life.

959
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:37,394
You don't know the shit I've been through
since you left.

960
01:16:37,478 --> 01:16:38,812
Then tell me.

961
01:16:38,896 --> 01:16:39,772
Why?

962
01:16:39,855 --> 01:16:41,315
Why, Alicia? Because you care?

963
01:16:41,398 --> 01:16:42,900
Of course I do.

964
01:16:42,983 --> 01:16:45,402
-You bailed!
-I begged you to come with me.

965
01:16:46,403 --> 01:16:49,406
We were 17,
and I was terrified out there without you.

966
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:51,617
Yeah? Well, you should've stayed gone.

967
01:16:52,326 --> 01:16:53,160
Why?

968
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:56,497
Because seeing me
reminds you you had a choice?

969
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,207
Bitch, I'll whup your...

970
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:03,295
Seeing you reminds me that you killed Zero.

971
01:17:03,379 --> 01:17:05,422
I didn't kill Zero, and you know it.

972
01:17:07,716 --> 01:17:09,343
We gonna find out, bitch.

973
01:17:11,804 --> 01:17:12,930
Hey, D.

974
01:17:13,889 --> 01:17:15,224
Right where she said it was.

975
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:19,061
-How this shit even work?
-I don't know.

976
01:17:19,144 --> 01:17:20,604
Yo, Tez.

977
01:17:20,688 --> 01:17:22,398
Quit the game and figure this shit out.

978
01:17:23,732 --> 01:17:25,693
I don't know. I may have to hack into it.

979
01:17:25,776 --> 01:17:28,320
Did I ask for a damn TED Talk? Just figure the shit out.

980
01:17:29,029 --> 01:17:30,239
Make it play.

981
01:17:38,914 --> 01:17:41,667
Darius's lair is here.
We got to bring West out alive.

982
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,876
It's on the east side!

983
01:17:48,215 --> 01:17:49,466
Watch it! Watch it!

984
01:18:00,102 --> 01:18:02,646
-So, what we doing, Malone?
-Get the body camera.

985
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:05,482
She does not get out of here alive.

986
01:18:05,566 --> 01:18:06,859
Do you understand me?

987
01:18:11,655 --> 01:18:12,823
Let's move out!

988
01:18:15,701 --> 01:18:19,288
Listen, man. I will help you get the camera,
but I am not gonna kill her.

989
01:18:19,371 --> 01:18:21,749
Well, then look the other way, Jennings.

990
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:25,127
That's what you do, isn't it?

991
01:18:39,642 --> 01:18:42,853
-You got something?
-You know these are police files, right?

992
01:18:42,936 --> 01:18:45,939
Come on, this is easy. You play video games all day.
You can crack that.

993
01:18:56,283 --> 01:18:57,534
-This way.
-Move, move, move.

994
01:19:35,864 --> 01:19:37,533
You know whatever's on that camera...

995
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:40,828
it's not going to get us out of here, right?

996
01:19:48,836 --> 01:19:50,587
-Anything?
-Not yet.

997
01:20:05,477 --> 01:20:07,855
Stairs. Take Brown with you.

998
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:16,530
All these files are encrypted.

999
01:20:16,613 --> 01:20:17,740
There's nothing on there?

1000
01:20:19,074 --> 01:20:21,035
Okay, wait, I think I see something.

1001
01:20:23,912 --> 01:20:25,414
Got anything?

1002
01:20:25,497 --> 01:20:26,540
No. It's nothing.

1003
01:20:26,623 --> 01:20:28,584
-I can't open this.
-Time's up.

1004
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:30,210
I told you this bitch was lying, yo.

1005
01:20:30,294 --> 01:20:32,963
-No, wait, it's there. It's there. It's--
-Wait. D.

1006
01:20:33,047 --> 01:20:34,465
Wait, this is it.

1007
01:20:34,548 --> 01:20:37,343
-D, I got it.
-<i>...the payment schedule.</i>

1008
01:20:37,426 --> 01:20:38,677
<i>Right. According to you.</i>

1009
01:20:39,011 --> 01:20:41,764
<i>Look, I've been loyal to you.
It's been coming down for months.</i>

1010
01:20:41,847 --> 01:20:44,099
<i>I have not said one thing.</i>

1011
01:20:44,516 --> 01:20:45,976
<i>Malone, listen to me.</i>

1012
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:49,772
<i>-I'm listening.
-This train's moving too fast for you to put the brakes on it.</i>

1013
01:20:49,855 --> 01:20:51,774
<i>Nobody needs to know what you've done here.</i>

1014
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:54,109
<i>Look, you have nothing to worry about.</i>

1015
01:20:54,193 --> 01:20:55,903
<i>There's no way I would ever tell Darius.</i>

1016
01:20:55,986 --> 01:20:58,238
<i>You already got rid of everybody that can talk.</i>

1017
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,915
<i>That's right, Zero.
I got rid of everybody that could talk.</i>

1018
01:21:09,333 --> 01:21:11,085
Just because she filmed it don't mean

1019
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:13,087
-she wasn't a part of it.
-Yeah.

1020
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:16,090
<i>What the hell are you doing?
I thought I told you to stay in the car.</i>

1021
01:21:17,132 --> 01:21:18,133
<i>Just relax.</i>

1022
01:21:18,217 --> 01:21:19,551
<i>This isn't what it looks like.</i>

1023
01:21:22,096 --> 01:21:23,222
We got to post this shit.

1024
01:21:34,108 --> 01:21:35,067
Take him down.

1025
01:21:40,948 --> 01:21:42,032
We're good.

1026
01:21:56,547 --> 01:21:58,257
-Hey, yo, it's a hit!
-Yo, what the fuck?

1027
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,683
Shoot them, man!

1028
01:22:10,686 --> 01:22:12,104
-That's him!
-Shoot that motherfucker, man!

1029
01:22:12,187 --> 01:22:14,440
-What the fuck?
-Missy, take Tez with you.

1030
01:22:17,484 --> 01:22:18,694
-Tez, jump!
-Oh, shit, I'm shot!

1031
01:22:18,777 --> 01:22:20,154
Go, Missy.

1032
01:22:20,237 --> 01:22:22,156
-Where you at?
-Move. D, D, move!

1033
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,283
-Oh, shit, I'm shot!
-That bitch in the back room!

1034
01:22:25,826 --> 01:22:26,827
Cover me!

1035
01:22:28,787 --> 01:22:30,706
Suppress! Suppress and shoot!

1036
01:22:30,789 --> 01:22:32,041
-Move it forward!
-Get them!

1037
01:22:35,586 --> 01:22:38,130
Move it forward! Move it forward!
Go, go, go! Open!

1038
01:22:38,213 --> 01:22:40,215
-Damn, these cops.
-Watch that door.

1039
01:22:40,299 --> 01:22:42,301
-This is fucked up!
-Open it!

1040
01:22:42,384 --> 01:22:43,844
Go!

1041
01:22:43,927 --> 01:22:45,054
Eyes on that hallway!

1042
01:22:53,812 --> 01:22:54,772
Where'd Missy go?

1043
01:22:54,855 --> 01:22:56,190
She went that way!

1044
01:23:06,283 --> 01:23:07,993
Come on, you motherfuckers! Come on!

1045
01:23:09,787 --> 01:23:11,872
Come on! Pussy-ass cops.

1046
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:13,332
I'll cover you. Go!

1047
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:15,376
Come on, Malone!

1048
01:23:24,093 --> 01:23:25,427
Go! Go!

1049
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:30,516
Ox!

1050
01:23:31,141 --> 01:23:32,142
No!

1051
01:23:38,148 --> 01:23:40,818
I saw the body cam, asshole.

1052
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:42,903
I saw what you did to my nephew.

1053
01:23:48,742 --> 01:23:50,786
You killed my nephew. You killed Zero.

1054
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:52,246
You played me.

1055
01:23:58,252 --> 01:24:00,421
Where is it? Where's the body cam?

1056
01:24:00,504 --> 01:24:01,505
Where's the body cam?

1057
01:24:03,007 --> 01:24:03,966
Kiss...

1058
01:24:05,467 --> 01:24:07,636
my ass.

1059
01:24:43,422 --> 01:24:44,298
Where's West?

1060
01:24:47,843 --> 01:24:49,178
Somebody must have taken her.

1061
01:24:50,638 --> 01:24:52,181
Yo, Brown, wait a second.

1062
01:24:54,975 --> 01:24:56,477
Okay, go. Go.

1063
01:25:04,193 --> 01:25:05,027
There.

1064
01:25:06,195 --> 01:25:07,488
I did my job.

1065
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:14,620
Everybody, calm down!

1066
01:25:18,791 --> 01:25:20,501
West! Freeze!

1067
01:25:20,584 --> 01:25:22,252
Put your hands on your head.

1068
01:25:22,336 --> 01:25:24,546
Listen, I don't know what they told you,
all right?

1069
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:26,966
-Get your hands up.
-But it's not true, okay?

1070
01:25:27,049 --> 01:25:29,093
-Stay where you are!
-My body cam--

1071
01:25:29,176 --> 01:25:31,095
I filmed the whole thing
on my body cam.

1072
01:25:31,178 --> 01:25:32,262
That's the guy!

1073
01:25:47,111 --> 01:25:48,362
You're a fool, West.

1074
01:25:48,445 --> 01:25:49,947
You should've just given--

1075
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:09,258
You okay?

1076
01:26:11,176 --> 01:26:12,428
Shots came from next level!

1077
01:27:07,983 --> 01:27:10,694
I'm never gonna get this body cam out of here
dressed like this.

1078
01:27:10,778 --> 01:27:14,740
You ain't getting out of here, period.
The entire police force is out there.

1079
01:27:14,823 --> 01:27:16,867
We're not gonna make it out of here alive.

1080
01:27:19,203 --> 01:27:20,913
They're looking for a female cop, right?

1081
01:27:22,081 --> 01:27:24,667
If you give me your vest and your body cam,

1082
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,378
I can't promise, but I'll get this shit into the station.

1083
01:27:30,089 --> 01:27:31,632
That ain't gonna work. Look at us.

1084
01:27:31,715 --> 01:27:35,260
Alicia, you got to expose these bastards.

1085
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:38,138
We ain't go through all this shit for nothing.

1086
01:27:38,514 --> 01:27:41,642
This morning, you wouldn't even talk to me.
Now you'll do this?

1087
01:27:41,725 --> 01:27:43,310
You got any better ideas?

1088
01:27:46,855 --> 01:27:47,731
No, I don't.

1089
01:27:49,858 --> 01:27:50,693
Give it to me.

1090
01:27:51,986 --> 01:27:53,237
I got this.

1091
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:07,960
Thank you.

1092
01:28:11,505 --> 01:28:12,506
One thing--

1093
01:28:12,631 --> 01:28:14,925
I don't know nothing about no computers.

1094
01:28:15,342 --> 01:28:16,844
You got to tell me what to do.

1095
01:28:45,122 --> 01:28:46,790
You need to calm down!

1096
01:28:49,084 --> 01:28:50,336
Let us go!

1097
01:28:50,419 --> 01:28:52,713
Let us go! Let us go!

1098
01:28:52,796 --> 01:28:55,382
Get in there. Just listen to me!

1099
01:28:55,466 --> 01:28:56,383
You're okay.

1100
01:29:04,391 --> 01:29:06,518
Jennings, over here!

1101
01:29:06,602 --> 01:29:07,728
Yeah, I'm coming.

1102
01:29:08,979 --> 01:29:10,773
I need you to get out of my way.

1103
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:01,615
Check every apartment on this floor.

1104
01:30:14,378 --> 01:30:15,587
Let's go. Come on.

1105
01:30:18,132 --> 01:30:19,675
-Too tight.
-Come on.

1106
01:30:19,758 --> 01:30:20,926
Relax.

1107
01:30:28,892 --> 01:30:29,768
West!

1108
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:43,115
Okay. Okay.

1109
01:31:02,092 --> 01:31:03,260
Give it up, West!

1110
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,973
If you want to get out of here alive,
I'm your only hope.

1111
01:31:56,855 --> 01:31:58,941
This district died after Katrina.

1112
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:01,151
FEMA screwed us.

1113
01:32:01,777 --> 01:32:03,612
Politicians screwed us.

1114
01:32:04,905 --> 01:32:06,365
It was on life support.

1115
01:32:06,448 --> 01:32:08,492
Over half the businesses, the people,

1116
01:32:09,159 --> 01:32:10,786
the families, they all left!

1117
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:12,788
West...

1118
01:32:12,871 --> 01:32:15,082
they all left, just like you.

1119
01:32:15,165 --> 01:32:18,127
Rats on a sinking ship.

1120
01:32:22,339 --> 01:32:23,257
Not me.

1121
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,718
Not mine. We stayed.

1122
01:32:27,219 --> 01:32:28,429
We fought for this city.

1123
01:32:37,855 --> 01:32:41,817
Even when there was no money
for schools or streetlights...

1124
01:32:43,068 --> 01:32:44,486
people still want the law.

1125
01:32:46,739 --> 01:32:47,948
Well, that costs.

1126
01:32:49,783 --> 01:32:51,035
It costs.

1127
01:33:12,306 --> 01:33:16,435
Everyone's over at Kingston Manor.
I just saw Malone's ride outside.

1128
01:33:17,978 --> 01:33:21,231
-You seen him or Smitty anywhere?
-No, man, I haven't.

1129
01:33:21,315 --> 01:33:22,608
Have a good shift, all right?

1130
01:33:22,691 --> 01:33:24,068
Hey, you too, buddy.

1131
01:33:33,702 --> 01:33:36,246
Do you expect all these men, good men,

1132
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:39,917
to put their lives on the line
day in and day out for nothing?

1133
01:33:41,085 --> 01:33:45,005
While those scumbag drug dealers
make all that money, is that what you expect?

1134
01:33:45,422 --> 01:33:46,298
West!

1135
01:33:54,264 --> 01:33:56,642
Come here. You son of a...

1136
01:34:52,823 --> 01:34:53,907
Get him!

1137
01:34:56,535 --> 01:34:58,287
-Go ahead, girl!
-She's fucking him up!

1138
01:34:59,496 --> 01:35:00,706
She's kicking his ass!

1139
01:35:04,168 --> 01:35:05,044
Shit.

1140
01:35:17,431 --> 01:35:18,682
Get your bitch ass back!

1141
01:35:20,643 --> 01:35:21,769
Son of a...

1142
01:35:23,145 --> 01:35:24,480
Put a hot one in him. Go ahead.

1143
01:35:24,563 --> 01:35:26,607
-Put a hot one in him.
-All right there, shorty.

1144
01:35:26,857 --> 01:35:27,900
Your bitch ass.

1145
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:32,279
-Hey, y'all better get back.
-Back up, back up. Get out the way!

1146
01:35:36,283 --> 01:35:37,701
You're under arrest, Malone.

1147
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:46,335
-You have the right to remain silent.
-I know my rights!

1148
01:35:46,418 --> 01:35:48,962
Oh, it's just other people's
you have a problem with?

1149
01:36:00,849 --> 01:36:02,017
Shoot that motherfucker.

1150
01:36:02,101 --> 01:36:03,727
Take out your cuffs.

1151
01:36:05,437 --> 01:36:07,439
Come on, y'all, back up.

1152
01:36:07,523 --> 01:36:09,650
-Look!
-Drop your gun!

1153
01:36:09,733 --> 01:36:10,943
Do it now!

1154
01:36:12,152 --> 01:36:13,529
We will shoot you!

1155
01:36:14,405 --> 01:36:15,614
I'm a cop!

1156
01:36:15,698 --> 01:36:16,949
You're a cop killer.

1157
01:36:17,032 --> 01:36:19,618
Put the gun down and back away!

1158
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:22,579
You better put the gun down.

1159
01:36:25,457 --> 01:36:26,333
He's tripping.

1160
01:36:29,086 --> 01:36:30,170
Licia, put it down.

1161
01:36:31,714 --> 01:36:34,091
-Do it.
-Put your weapon down!

1162
01:36:41,557 --> 01:36:43,642
I got this! Nobody move!

1163
01:36:43,726 --> 01:36:44,977
Nobody move!

1164
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,895
Stay back, everyone. I got this.

1165
01:36:58,991 --> 01:37:00,951
Stop. Stop. Don't move.

1166
01:37:01,035 --> 01:37:02,494
What are you doing in here?

1167
01:37:02,578 --> 01:37:05,372
I do know you.
You're the guy from the market.

1168
01:37:05,456 --> 01:37:06,790
Don't move. I swear to God.

1169
01:37:08,584 --> 01:37:11,378
Up against the wall. Turn around. Go.

1170
01:37:11,462 --> 01:37:12,504
Spread them.

1171
01:37:32,483 --> 01:37:33,984
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

1172
01:37:36,195 --> 01:37:37,821
Where's the camera? Where is it?

1173
01:37:38,322 --> 01:37:41,700
I could blow your freaking brains out,
and they'd give me a medal, you know that?

1174
01:37:41,784 --> 01:37:43,535
Breaking into a police station.

1175
01:37:46,205 --> 01:37:47,206
What?

1176
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:50,793
What did you do?

1177
01:37:57,049 --> 01:37:58,550
How does it feel?

1178
01:38:01,428 --> 01:38:02,513
Where is it?

1179
01:38:02,596 --> 01:38:04,014
Where's the body cam?

1180
01:38:04,098 --> 01:38:06,183
Where'd you put it? Last chance.

1181
01:38:06,266 --> 01:38:07,685
I'll make this all go away.

1182
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:25,619
Look at them.

1183
01:38:26,954 --> 01:38:28,122
Look at them.

1184
01:38:28,205 --> 01:38:30,082
You picked the wrong side.

1185
01:38:30,666 --> 01:38:33,502
Nobody cares about you.

1186
01:38:34,169 --> 01:38:37,172
Look at them,
you think they'd give a shit about if you live?

1187
01:38:37,256 --> 01:38:39,425
You think they're gonna give up their lives for you?
Where's the camera?

1188
01:38:39,508 --> 01:38:41,010
That's not the point.

1189
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:48,642
-What is the point?
-The point is,

1190
01:38:48,726 --> 01:38:51,603
"Be the change," you asshole.

1191
01:38:54,189 --> 01:38:57,526
<i>Look, you have nothing to worry about.
There's no way I would ever tell Darius.</i>

1192
01:38:57,609 --> 01:38:59,820
<i>You already got rid of everybody that can talk.</i>

1193
01:39:02,906 --> 01:39:04,199
Patch me through to SRT.

1194
01:39:06,285 --> 01:39:07,911
You ain't changed shit.

1195
01:39:07,995 --> 01:39:10,539
<i>This is Captain Hackett. Stand down.</i>

1196
01:39:11,957 --> 01:39:13,417
<i>That's a direct order.</i>

1197
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,170
<i>Do you hear me? Alicia West is innocent.
Stand down now.</i>

1198
01:39:16,253 --> 01:39:17,254
Go!

1199
01:39:19,423 --> 01:39:20,674
Damn!

1200
01:39:20,758 --> 01:39:22,134
Oh, my God!

1201
01:39:32,436 --> 01:39:33,437
Son of a...

1202
01:39:38,317 --> 01:39:39,485
Crazy!

1203
01:39:42,529 --> 01:39:44,114
Stay down, Malone. Don't move.

1204
01:39:45,699 --> 01:39:47,368
Hell, man...

1205
01:39:47,451 --> 01:39:50,079
-Drop your gun!
-Get your hands on your head!

1206
01:39:50,162 --> 01:39:52,039
-It's over, man.
-Yo, yo, yo.

1207
01:39:55,751 --> 01:39:57,211
You have any idea...

1208
01:39:59,963 --> 01:40:02,091
how many nightmares y'all gave me?

1209
01:40:05,302 --> 01:40:06,679
But you know what?

1210
01:40:06,762 --> 01:40:08,305
I'm gonna let you slide.

1211
01:40:09,723 --> 01:40:10,683
This time.

1212
01:40:17,022 --> 01:40:17,982
Nah.

1213
01:40:27,616 --> 01:40:28,909
-I'm hit. I'm hit.
-Okay.

1214
01:40:28,993 --> 01:40:30,452
-Easy.
-I need everybody to just back up!

1215
01:40:30,536 --> 01:40:32,913
Get your goddamn hands off me.
What are you doing?

1216
01:40:32,997 --> 01:40:35,874
-What are you doing? Under arrest for what?
-You're under arrest, you piece of shit.

1217
01:40:35,958 --> 01:40:38,669
-What are the charges?
-You have the right to remain silent.

1218
01:40:38,752 --> 01:40:42,047
Anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

1219
01:40:42,131 --> 01:40:43,632
You have the right to an attorney.

1220
01:40:43,716 --> 01:40:45,175
If you cannot afford an attorney,

1221
01:40:45,259 --> 01:40:46,760
one will be provided for you.

1222
01:40:46,844 --> 01:40:49,096
Do you understand the rights
I have just read to you?

1223
01:40:51,307 --> 01:40:53,392
Think you made a difference here tonight, West?

1224
01:40:54,601 --> 01:40:55,686
You changed nothing.

1225
01:40:55,769 --> 01:40:59,148
Maybe not, but it's a start.

1226
01:41:01,567 --> 01:41:02,860
Take his ass to jail.

1227
01:41:06,322 --> 01:41:07,489
Good job, West.

1228
01:41:07,573 --> 01:41:08,824
Way to go, West.

1229
01:41:10,492 --> 01:41:11,744
Step back!

1230
01:41:11,827 --> 01:41:13,787
Sir, I said move!

1231
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:15,205
Ma'am, to your left.

1232
01:41:32,389 --> 01:41:33,432
I'm sorry.

1233
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,728
Thank you.

1234
01:42:16,892 --> 01:42:18,352
<i>Good morning, New Orleans.</i>

1235
01:42:18,435 --> 01:42:20,688
<i>In the news, after a police investigation,</i>

1236
01:42:20,771 --> 01:42:25,234
<i>Detective Terry Malone was charged
with three counts of first-degree murder</i>

1237
01:42:25,317 --> 01:42:28,028
<i>for the execution of three unarmed black men.</i>

1238
01:42:28,112 --> 01:42:30,072
<i>Today's guests will discuss the tragedy</i>

1239
01:42:30,155 --> 01:42:32,282
<i>and the surprise injustices.</i>

1240
01:43:03,397 --> 01:43:04,982
I'm happy you're here.

1241
01:43:06,817 --> 01:43:07,818
You know...

1242
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:11,280
you saved my life.

1243
01:43:11,363 --> 01:43:12,364
No, no.

1244
01:43:13,866 --> 01:43:15,242
You saved my life.

1245
01:43:18,787 --> 01:43:20,080
I appreciate you.
