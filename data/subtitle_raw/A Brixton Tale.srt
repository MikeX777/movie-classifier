Do you mind doing it?

80
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:22,248

I'm Archie.

84
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,520
This is Benji.

85
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:30,600
Your lighter says GV.

86
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,192
Yeah, it ain't mine.

87
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,240
I took it.

88
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:36,936
Ah, okay so you guys

89
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,248

90
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,240
Family business.

91
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:41,928
Oi, Benji's cousin Darius is
serious man.

92
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:44,104
My man is the baddest roadman
for miles.

93
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:45,288
Tell me more.

94
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:46,728
Heh, nah man, no.

95
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:48,488
You could be a fed.

96
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,856
What? Is this your Mum's shop?

97
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:52,712
Ask for the Archie
special, you get me.

98
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,664
Go straight in there and say
"give me the Archie special"

99
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:57,096
There's no such thing as the
Archie special.

100
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:58,536
Is there a Benji special?

101
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,872
I mean, it-it's just my mom
shop, so I'm guessing

102
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:03,112
there must be a Benji special.

103
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,920
What? Benji, bruv. What
Benji do you know?

104
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,280
- You're a liar, bruv.
- Liar fam, I'm not.

105
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,135
You know I do my ting fam.

You know I do my ting.

107
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:18,664
Doesn't, I mean I don't

00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:20,040
- I don't, like.
- You're a liar.

109
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:22,824
I've known since I was, what?

110
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,264
What? What like five?

111
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:25,896
- Since you were five.
- When we were cheating?

112
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:33,800
You know what? Let me,

113
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:34,983
Let me let go of it, yea?

114

Yeah, yeah

Yeah,

00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,832
Say that again...

00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,896
She's from endz, bruv.

126
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,920
Inez darling, I want a
big portion though.

127
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:28,776
Yes, but...
See, that's what
you need.

128
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:30,632
You can't even handle the
spice boy.
Of course I can cuz.

129
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,704
Shank him, ain't it yea? Shank a
man.

130
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,591
Nobody's doin that.

131
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,192
I'd shank a man, fam.
I'd shank you fam.
Put it down.

132
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:38,375
Just put it down.

133
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:40,488
We don't shank a man in
my kitchen.

134
00:11:44,008 --> 00:11:46,024
We can't give away all the
secrets because it's uh...

135
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,848
It's a family recipe, so...

136
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:49,224
so it-it's all over.

137
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,664
Keep it in the family.

138
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:51,688
Keep it in the family.

139
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,864
Mum, do you want to give away a
little something?

140
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:54,856
Little knowledge there.

00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,648
Oh, yes, I saw that. You
gotta get that.

142
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,535
I'll give you a little knowledge

00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,080

Serves you right, serves you

Don't come to my sink. You're

154
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,512
- Inez! Inez!

155
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:31,879
Benji, take him out of my
kitchen please.
I don't want him going,

156
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,447
You're sorry. Just take him out
my kitchen.

157
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,815
- Ey, you're sorry.
- Calm down, bruv. Be cool.

158
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:37,191
Let's go. Relax. Relax.
Everything is spicy,

159
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,071
I'm relaxed cuz. I'm

160
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:41,735
Well, Inez though, I want a big
portion though.

161
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:42,951
- I want it.
- Yes, what.

162
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:46,472
It's good.

163
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:47,977
Yeah?

164
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,079
Listen, no promises,

165
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,288
but you keep going with this.

I'm be able to organize a
screening.

167
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,553
You know we're doing a showcase
in ten days.

168
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,376
Oh my God great. I've got a ton
of ideas.

169
00:12:58,407 --> 00:12:59,367
You deaf?

170
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,800
You heard me when I said no
promises right?

171
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:03,048
There's not a lot of time.

172
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,448
And let's face it, you're
basically still a fucking
embryo.

173
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,559
I promise I won't show you up.

174
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:12,168
Okay...good.

Hey, do you want anything?

00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,168

Oh, oh Benji, this is Charles.

Ah, your bit of rough. Hey mate.

236

You're alright Benji?

237
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,184
Nice to meet you.

238
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:08,649
Um...I'll tell you to watch out
for this one.

239
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,729
She's got about 15 different
personalities,

240
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,287
I hope you like schizophrenia.

241
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,159
That's-that's-that's not what
schizophrenia is.

242
00:19:17,192 --> 00:19:20,072
Maybe you should uh...pick up a
book fam.

243
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,936
Good one, mate. I'll see you at
Cambridge I suppose?

244
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:28,296
Um...anyway, bottom line is she
could be a real cunt.

245
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:29,703
What?

246
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,423
She can be a real cunt.
Watch your fucking
language.

247
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:36,295
Calm down boy. It's
alright, you're at a party.
Hey, get off me man.

248
00:19:36,872 --> 00:19:39,112
Are you a bit drunk, huh? A bit
fucked up?

249
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:40,967
Say that again.

250
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,015
Say it to my face bro.

251
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:45,289
Say it again!

252
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,072
What. No I...
Yeah that's what I
thought.

253
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,376
Get the fuck out of this
party, bruv.

00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:51,944

Mad.

257
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,544
I'm not sure about
this man.
Bruv, I know it fam.

258
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:11,433
She stalked you.

259
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,320
She even admitted it fam.

260
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:15,688
This is totally legit.

261
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,680
Shh!

262
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:46,152
Holy shit Benjamin.

263
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:49,320
This girl's a proper rich girl.

264
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,776
Man's hit the jackpot cuz.

265
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,624
No wonder she didn't say nothing
to you.

266
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,896
In case you're the gold digger
fam.

267
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,328
Mad...

268
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,752

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,184

Okay, okay. What are we going to

301
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,944

302
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,544
Fuck off is it that bad?

303
00:24:49,576 --> 00:24:51,592
Listen, this ain't working.

304
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:54,536
I mean, shooting yourself

305
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:55,975
makes you look inauthentic here.

306
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,352
I mean, it's about the boys in
the estate, right?

307
00:24:57,384 --> 00:24:59,304
It's just...leave yourself out
of it.

308
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:01,096
- But I'm like hardly in it.
- What else is there?

309
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:02,248
What else is there? All
right. Yeah.

310
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,976
Before, there was more edge.

311
00:25:04,008 --> 00:25:05,608
You've made it soft.

312
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:07,400
Don't do that.

313
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,711
You look really good on camera.
You should be an actor.

314
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:58,280
We're all actors.

315
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:03,240
Really? No wonder the economy's
fucked.

316
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,416
No. I mean

317
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:08,968
we learn by imitating, right?

318
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:12,104
Adapting and whatever.

319
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:15,560
So, we're all actors.

320
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:20,072
Wow, someone's philosophical
today.

321
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:38,920
Why don't we ever go to yours?

322
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:44,552
What the fuck's going on here?

323
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,920
We're building a sandcastle,

324
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:48,424
- Do you want to help?
- Leah.

325
00:26:48,456 --> 00:26:50,504
Just leave it. This guy's crazy.

326
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,224
Ha, it's alright Stewart man.
We'll...

327
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,408
Sorry, we-we'll cut.

328
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,592
No you won't.

329
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:57,000
There's been an incident
in the area.

330
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,536
Wow.

331
00:26:58,569 --> 00:27:00,360
One male, one female, matching
your description.

332
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:01,352
Oh really?

333
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:02,920
Yes really.

334
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:05,704
Well I've heard there are two
fat white men in the area.

335
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:09,480
I think you fit that description
pretty well.

336
00:27:28,615 --> 00:27:29,640
Your cousin Darius.

337
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:32,680
Now, I'm going to ask you some
questions about him.

338
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:34,279
You're going to answer them,
aren't you?

339
00:27:38,344 --> 00:27:39,335
Okay...

340
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:43,496
I'm going to ask you some
questions now.

341
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,095
You didn't get that from us.

342
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,632
Okay, Benji,

343
00:27:51,624 --> 00:27:52,648

344
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,600

345
00:28:03,272 --> 00:28:04,424
Pull over here.

Well, where are we?

347
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,319
This is Loughborough
Estate. I'm from Somerleyton.

348
00:28:21,352 --> 00:28:23,432
We can't be here. C'mon Leah.

No way they knew I was from

You know you can get those pigs

Or maybe you just drop about it

394

Trust me Benji.

395
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:37,288
You have to learn how to stick
up for yourself.

396
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:44,552
Otherwise people are just gonna
keep grinding you down.

397
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,041
Yo, it's Benji.

398
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:10,279

I asked you nicely to delete it.
Do you remember that?

438
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:21,576
Benji I'm really sorry, I wanted

439
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:22,696
but I couldn't find you...

440
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:24,295
Tilda she told me that I should
make a--

441
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:25,640
You made some tweaks.

442
00:36:25,672 --> 00:36:26,600
Yeah.

443
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:30,632

Quite a star.

That you don't come across at

447
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,551
What do you want? I
mean...people don't want to see

448
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,664

449
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:43,945

Auntie.

While it's you holding

455
00:36:54,249 --> 00:36:56,296
Yeah that's typical innit.

456
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:58,249
You didn't want anyone to think

00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,240
so there you go.

458
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,647
Congratulations Ophelia.

459
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,840
Are you gonna eat that, fam?

460
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:00,744
I feel kinda sick bruv.

461
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,208
I think I'm getting the flu or
something.

462
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:07,144
Hey did-did you hear about Raf?

463
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:08,296
No.

464
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,863
Fam.

465
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:11,816
Man got 'cuffed right outside
his yard fam,

466
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:14,216
in front of his mumsy and dad,
and that Stewart nicked him.

467
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,104
Shit man, I never heard.

468
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,800
Bruv.

469
00:38:18,056 --> 00:38:19,016
It's getting mad.

470
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,696
I'm gonna go toilet real quick
G.

471
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:38,792
What's the bag for, man?

472
00:38:44,136 --> 00:38:46,696
Bruv, you need to fucking knock

473
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:48,712
Are you fucking serious,

474
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,792
Hey, c'mere man, c'mere bruv.

475
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:02,760
So uh, how about
Coalville Abby?

476
00:41:03,624 --> 00:41:05,480
Where's that?

477
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,424
Well, it's a little out of the
way, but that's no bad thing.

478
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:11,784
I've talked to Will about this,
and he's got a choice of about

479
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:15,368
five schools that all do
media studies,

480
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,584
which obviously is very, very
important,

481
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:18,184
I've done my research.

482
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:19,848
I know how you like making
movies.

483
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:22,888
Uhh, you might not like them. I
love them,

484
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,120
And that's the most important
thing. It a...

485
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:42,888
Ophelia?

486
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,728
So I don't see you in a while.

487
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,103
Yeah. And...

488
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:22,023
I made a mistake.

489
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:24,840
You made a mistake

490
00:42:27,496 --> 00:42:30,984
Archie tell me, he say you come
from a good family.

491
00:42:31,496 --> 00:42:33,160
Yeah, I guess.

492
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:38,695
Benji's a good youth you know.

493
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:40,552
No he isn't, he's an adult Inez.

494
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:43,143
Benji is a good youth.

495
00:42:43,176 --> 00:42:44,840
I don't want to hear Benji
running up and down

496
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:47,720
and doing any of your madness of
foolishness no more.

497
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,336
It's like you're not listening
to me little girl.

498
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:38,568
It was ages ago Benji,

499
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,095
it, it was before I ever met
you.

500
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,256
Fucking Charles.

501
00:43:47,048 --> 00:43:49,960
He's gonna post it everywhere as
well. I know he is.

502
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:53,192
And my Dad is gonna see it.

503
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:57,448
Everyone's going to see...

504
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:01,352
ev-everyone is gonna see me.

505
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:05,959
Benji?

506
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:08,168
Benji?

507
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,135
I'm not a fucking pussy.

508
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:38,664
Do you have anything else?

509
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:40,904
That depends.

510
00:46:40,935 --> 00:46:41,928
Have you been drinking?

511
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,528
No.

512
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:45,575
Well, in that case.

513
00:46:46,312 --> 00:46:47,977
I have this here.

514
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:49,352
Cheers Albert.

515
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:02,152
Fuck there he is.

516
00:47:03,752 --> 00:47:07,784
The fuck you looking at?

517
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,848
I mean it Charles. It was a
really fucked up thing to do.

518
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:14,183
That's sad.

519
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:17,545
No the saddest thing is no one
even cared.

520
00:47:18,664 --> 00:47:19,912
Oh.

521
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:24,839
This is fucking boring. What do
you want, Ophelia?

522
00:47:24,872 --> 00:47:26,312
You consented.

523
00:47:26,855 --> 00:47:28,968
Not to being fucking filmed
Charles.

524
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:30,728
What the fuck are you talking
about? Of course you did.

525
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,648
You love getting yourself
filmed, don' t you?

526
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:35,655
You know, I'm going to tell you
a little secret.

527
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:39,625
You're not powerful or a victim
of some brutal injustice.

528
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:43,561
You are just, my darling, a
crazy fucking bitch.

529
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,288
Okay.

530
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:48,392
I'm sorry.

531
00:47:48,424 --> 00:47:49,895
I'm sorry. Okay?

532
00:47:51,623 --> 00:47:52,552
To be honest, I've.

533
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:56,423
I don't really know why I did
any of it.

534
00:47:56,455 --> 00:47:57,479
I just wanted to....

535
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:02,248

00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,489
Huh? Answer me, yes or no?

537
00:48:05,577 --> 00:48:08,168
Yes or no.

538
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,944
And take out your phone and
delete the ting fam.

539
00:48:16,615 --> 00:48:18,152
What do you mean?

540
00:48:18,824 --> 00:48:19,912

544

What do you want?

545
00:48:29,063 --> 00:48:30,409
Ophelia? What the fuck is this?

546
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,168
That's not my name.

547
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:17,704
Where?

548
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:28,743
I want to go

549
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:24,488
Hah, I blacked out last night
man.

550
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,784
I can't remember nothing for
hours. Still?

551
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,055
Yeah, same.

552
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:35,240
Alright, I have a question for
you.

553
00:50:38,759 --> 00:50:41,672
If you could change anything
about yourself, what would it
be?

554
00:50:47,432 --> 00:50:48,808
My feet.

555
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:52,199
It's way too big.

556
00:50:53,385 --> 00:50:54,601
What would you change about
yourself?

557
00:50:56,232 --> 00:50:57,481
No, it's personal.

558
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,441
What?

559
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,912
Nah. I can't.

560
00:50:59,943 --> 00:51:01,096
You can't do that.

561
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:09,096
I'd like to be less observant.

562
00:51:09,128 --> 00:51:12,327
Yeah, I like to be less sexy.

563
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,489
I'm serious.

564
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,216
Sorry.

565
00:51:19,624 --> 00:51:21,927
I have this thing when,

566
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:23,496
I can't have a conversation...

567
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:26,344
with anyone without noticing
all these

568
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:29,832
micro-expressions in their face.

569
00:51:29,864 --> 00:51:33,832
So, like, I'd be mid-sentence,
and...I can see

570
00:51:33,865 --> 00:51:37,416
this flash of something in their
eyes, or in their mouth...

571
00:51:38,409 --> 00:51:41,256
and...and I could tell what they
are thinking.

572
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:45,352
and like, she's dickhead

573
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,185
or I don't want to be here

574
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:54,472
or...

575
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:58,888
I don't know, just
disappointment.

576
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:06,472
Fuck, does he want man.

577
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:07,240

00:54:26,216 --> 00:54:27,176
Okay. Um.

606
00:54:28,456 --> 00:54:30,951
So he's still in intensive care.

607
00:54:30,984 --> 00:54:32,232
I can't take any visitors.

608
00:54:32,264 --> 00:54:34,056
Still critical.

609
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,192
They'll let us know if anything
changes.

610
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:39,080
It's all right.

611
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:41,447
It's going to be all right.

612
00:54:53,064 --> 00:54:54,568
You wanna chill? You wanna chill

00:55:09,448 --> 00:55:10,632

00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:13,224
Benji ain't no dickhead anymore
cuz.

621
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:14,184
A bagman now, ain't it fam.

622

Just like me cuz.

623
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,640

Bang.

00:55:27,848 --> 00:55:29,064
Bang.

629
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:06,216
I think...I th-think someth-

00:58:08,168 --> 00:58:10,824
I think I've done something.

631
00:58:29,064 --> 00:58:32,360
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting,

632
00:58:32,392 --> 00:58:35,080
So come on, what you got for
me?

633
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,336
I told...

634
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:40,296
Look, I'm sorry I've been really
intense of you last couple

635
00:58:40,329 --> 00:58:43,784
of times. I forget how young you
are sometimes.

636
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:46,920
I don't know what to do.

637
00:58:47,432 --> 00:58:51,175
What you talking about?

638
00:59:48,872 --> 00:59:50,824
Have you shown this to anyone?

639
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:52,904
Nobody.

640
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:54,184
Not your boyfriend?

641
00:59:54,728 --> 00:59:56,424
No.

642
00:59:57,352 --> 01:00:00,199
Have you uploaded it to
your computer?

643
01:00:00,232 --> 01:00:01,736
No.

644
01:00:03,464 --> 01:00:05,992
Good.

645
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:09,191
Okay,.

646
01:00:13,832 --> 01:00:17,193
Okay, everything's going to be
fine.

647
01:00:17,224 --> 01:00:18,439
Wait here.

648
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,680
I'll drive you home.

649
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:27,112
No. That makes no sense.

650
01:00:27,144 --> 01:00:29,480
Ophelia, your friend
will have his own counsel

651
01:00:29,512 --> 01:00:32,424
and his own defense. Let me
focus on yours.

652
01:00:32,456 --> 01:00:34,151
And if you can't remember
anything, then who knows

653
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:35,912
what happens? I-is that right?

654
01:00:35,944 --> 01:00:38,344
Well, whatever Benji did, I did.

655
01:00:38,377 --> 01:00:40,297
She can't talk like this
in court.

656
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:42,024
Leah? Leah?

657
01:00:43,624 --> 01:00:46,057
think of the consequences.

658
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:49,576
We're all trying to help
you here, Ophelia.

659
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:50,631
This is really it.

660
01:00:50,664 --> 01:00:53,384
And if you don't let us help
you, we have all had it.

661
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:56,135
But you especially--
I'm not fucking him
over Dad!

662
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:00,393
Leah, please.

663
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:02,760
Please.

664
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,800
Cuz you better not fuck
up in court ya know.

665
01:01:11,304 --> 01:01:13,384
I'm sorry about losing...

666
01:01:14,696 --> 01:01:17,320
...about the gun.

667
01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:21,224
Bruv the gun was a fucking test.

668
01:01:21,256 --> 01:01:22,984
He was not supposed to take it,

669
01:01:23,015 --> 01:01:26,120
let alone be fucking around and
walking the road of.

670
01:01:26,151 --> 01:01:27,784
What the fuck was he thinking?

671
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:31,113
I'm sorry.

672
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:32,744
Bruv, the gun's even the issue
right now.

673
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:35,591
It's the fucking girl, bruv.

674
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:38,568
What are you talking
about?
You know what I'm taking
about bruv.

675
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,616
It's your girl, bruv.

676
01:01:40,648 --> 01:01:42,440
If you didn't meet this
dumb bitch,

677
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:44,808
bruv you wouldn't be in a
situation at all.

678
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:47,784
Think about it bruv.

679
01:01:47,815 --> 01:01:50,281
Were you in this situation
before?

680
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:53,831
Only fing your nose is gonna
do is use you,

681
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,081
to get her off the case.

682
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:56,041
She wouldn't do that.

683
01:01:56,073 --> 01:01:57,128
How do you know that?

684
01:01:57,161 --> 01:01:58,791
How do you even know if she even
snitched on you already?

685
01:01:58,824 --> 01:01:59,848
Shut the fuck up bruv.

686
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:01,801
Oh you're a badman now, yeah?

687
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,657
You're a badman now, yeah?

688
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:05,416
Make sure you're a badman in
jail, you know.

689
01:02:05,704 --> 01:02:08,391
So when someone comes to cut
your face, bruv,

690
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:11,401
this fake shit ain't gonna work
bruv.

691
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:13,224
And ten mans gonna rush you in
the shower, bruv.

692
01:02:13,257 --> 01:02:16,008
This fake shit ain't gonna work.

693
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,775
What I'm trying to say bruv, you
not a badman fam.

694
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,697
Like you're not making no sense
bruv.

695
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:37,000
if you just listen to me, I
wouldn't be in a situation now.

696
01:02:37,031 --> 01:02:40,168
I don't want to go to jail, D.

697
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:44,744
I don't want to go
to jail.

698
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:17,704
I don't remember anything.

699
01:05:26,344 --> 01:05:30,599
The jury has found the defendant
guilty

700
01:05:30,632 --> 01:05:33,769
of one charge of grievous bodily
harm,

701
01:05:33,801 --> 01:05:36,872
one charge of possession of
firearms...

702
01:07:29,543 --> 01:07:30,663
Alright, shitface?

703
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:31,623

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,344
I'm getting the hang of it,

709
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,032
Your friend gets out today,
right?

710
01:07:49,225 --> 01:07:50,952
Look, why don't you take the
rest of the day off?

01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:53,224
Oh, no, it's fine.

712
01:07:53,256 --> 01:07:54,985
He doesn't want to see me
anyway.

713
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,800
Hey, look, Leah,

01:07:59,944 --> 01:08:02,376

01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,200
Um, Archie.

721
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:01,352

But, look at me.

01:09:48,775 --> 01:09:50,567
nobody's going to fuck with you.

736
01:09:51,623 --> 01:09:52,616
I swear that.

737
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:55,880
I ain't gettin' out, cuz.

738
01:09:56,968 --> 01:09:58,952
They found out about me.

01:10:05,449 --> 01:10:07,400
That's why they got me on this
