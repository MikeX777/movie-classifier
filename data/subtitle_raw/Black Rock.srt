1
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:46,613
<i>Oh, my God. </i>

2
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:50,349
<i>You, like, threw up back here
with your preparation.
I swear to God. </i>

3
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,284
<i>That's like a Sarah tornado. </i>

4
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,320
<i>You got your...
your mom's tent, I see. </i>

5
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,489
<i>- Which is a classic.
Oldie, but goodie.
- Yes. </i>

6
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:03,162
<i>- Of course.
- We got "people, "
"ok!, " "star. "</i>

7
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,531
<i>We are going
to an empty island. </i>

8
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,466
<i>Oh, my God!
There's like 10 of them!</i>

9
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:11,136
<i>- This is horrible news. -
We need entertainment. </i>

10
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,605
<i>- There's nothing else there.
- I'm there. </i>

11
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:16,341
<i>- Yeah, you're very pretty.
- I have so many stories. </i>

12
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,778
There's only so long
I can look at you and just
be like, "you're so pretty. "

13
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,314
And then I need
to look at trash.
You know what I mean?

14
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,383
- Right.
- I'm fucking happy, man.

15
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,351
You know, I'm happy.
I'm happy we're here.

16
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,087
I'm happy, too.
I'm excited.

17
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:31,356
<i> Steal them back
for me, love </i>

18
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,726
<i> oh, yeah</i>

19
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,296
<i> steal them back
for me, love </i>

20
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,098
<i> oh, yeah... </i>

21
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,405
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

22
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,340
<i>- "We got crabs. "
- I can't even... </i>

23
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:52,177
- like, that's crazy...
- I feel like we should
go in there

24
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,513
and just tell them that
they need to take that down.

25
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,248
At least they're being up front
and honest about it

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,683
<i>- 'cause usually, you know,
- That's true. </i>

27
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,818
Guys don't tell you, and then,
you know what, you end up

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,288
<i>- with a pantyful of lice.
- The whole... </i>

29
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,824
That is really,
really disgusting.

30
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:09,328
<i> Be careful where you lean </i>

31
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,865
<i> and when you're lost
under the blue sky </i>

32
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:16,768
<i> look down
and you'll find me </i>

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,204
<i> yeah... </i>

34
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,539
<i>- We're here.
- I know. </i>

35
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:23,375
<i>- It's a long time coming.
- It is crazy. </i>

36
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,844
<i>- How long has it been for you
- Like eight years. </i>

37
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,479
<i>Eight years, are you serious</i>

38
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,721
<i>That's weird. Is that...
are you serious</i>

39
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,390
<i>- Sarah...
- Is that... </i>

40
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:41,860
- ... why is Abby
sitting right there?
- Oh.

41
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,495
Why would you not tell me this?

42
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,669
This is such a bad idea.

43
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,772
Let's look at this
like an opportunity.

44
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,507
- She...
- Come on.
It's gonna be good.

45
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,509
- This is, like, unreasonable.
- Come on.

46
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,514
- Hey, abs.
- What are you doing?

47
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,849
- Give me a hug.
- What are you doing? No, no.

48
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,784
- Love me, love me.
- What is this?

49
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,820
You were like,
"oh, let's go on this
great weekend. You and me. "

50
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,656
<i>- I know.
- "We're gonna go out
to the island. </i>

51
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,858
We'll reconnect.
It'll be so awesome.
You and me. "

52
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,927
<i>- I know.
- Yeah, that's kinda...
kinda what you said to me. </i>

53
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,296
<i>- I'm sorry. I know.
- You and me. </i>

54
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:19,264
<i>- I'm sorry.
- You know what,
I'm just, like... </i>

55
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,467
- I took time off
to come up here.
- Do you wanna punch me?

56
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,636
I have a really
crazy life right now, okay?

57
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,873
<i>I don't have the time,
energy, interest... </i>

58
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,641
<i>- Give me just
a slap in the face.
- In, like, dealing with</i>

59
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,277
- all of this shit, okay?
- But it's gonna be so good.

60
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,713
You can say my name, Abby.
You're not gonna fucking
get leprosy.

61
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,915
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, guys.
- Thanks, Lou. Thank you.

62
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,919
Hello? Guys, this is
gonna be so great.

63
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,855
- We're here.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

64
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,524
So you guys have
a really great weekend,
though.

65
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,392
It was great to see you both,
honestly.

66
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,630
I'm sorry.
I'm with Abby
on this one.

67
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,233
Seriously, like, I hear
where you're coming from
and you're sweet,

68
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,701
but it's, like,
it's not a good call, man.

69
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:57,936
It's like...

70
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,672
Great.
Let's just...

71
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,376
We'll do it another time.

72
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,413
I have cancer.

73
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,355
What?

74
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,590
I didn't wanna say anything.
I didn't wanna ruin the trip.

75
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,592
I didn't want it to be
about that. I wanted it
to be about us.

76
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,665
- They say four to six months.
- What?!

77
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,601
They say four to six months,
but seriously, I've come
to terms with it.

78
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,403
<i>It's okay. </i>

79
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:34,039
It's okay.
The thing that I want most,

80
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,708
more than anything
in the world,

81
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,745
<i>is to have this final hurrah, </i>

82
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,314
just the three of us together.

83
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,787
Can we do that?

84
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,057
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- Can we do that</i>

85
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,025
<i>- Of course.
- Yes, yeah. </i>

86
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:55,727
Can we do that?
Yes, we can?

87
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,929
- Yes, yes.
- Seriously, can we do that?

88
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,768
'Cause I'm just
riddled with it,
you know?

89
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,339
Just... it's everywhere.

90
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,376
What?

91
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,046
- Are you fucking
with me right now?
-

92
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,783
<i>- I know...
- You don't have
fucking cancer?</i>

93
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:21,553
No... I do not
have cancer,

94
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:25,057
- oh, my God.
- But I do have a very good...

95
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,692
- oh, my God.
You're such an asshole.
- Did you just say that you

96
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,627
- have cancer so that we...
- That you guys... you...

97
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,028
<i>- I don't have cancer.
- Are you serious</i>

98
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,430
<i>- Oh...
- But the thing is... </i>

99
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,432
look it, you guys.
That was bad.

100
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,634
That was a bad,
bad thing to say and do.

101
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,469
That was a horrible thing
to say!

102
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,838
<i>That was a horrible thing
to do, but here's the thing:</i>

103
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,008
<i>We are all dying.
That's the truth. </i>

104
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,845
<i>We have no idea
what's gonna happen.
We don't know. </i>

105
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,015
We could be hit by a bus
tomorrow, you know?

106
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,417
- We could... we have no idea
what's gonna happen.
- Oh, my God.

107
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,587
And I'll tell you one thing
for certain... there are no
buses on that island.

108
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:58,724
- Okay.
- You know, so we can go out
there and be safe from buses,

109
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,026
- which is great.
- I still, like... I can't...

110
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,794
- shit is great.
- You're such a...

111
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,663
<i>- i want us back.
- This is so bad. </i>

112
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,932
- Say yes.
- Oh, God.

113
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,501
- You were looking at me like,
"yeah, you're so in. "
- You're an asshole.

114
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,636
Say yes, abs.
Is it a yes?

115
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,905
- I'm going, but I'm not happy.
- Yay!

116
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,744
- I love you.
- I hate you.

117
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,581
Yay, let's go camping!
It's gonna be so good, guys.

118
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,785
Fresh air, you know?

119
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,587
New beginnings.

120
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,621
Fresh start.

121
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,810
There she is, guys.
What a beauty.

122
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,614
- Wow.
- First-class travel.

123
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,454
Pass me some stuff.

124
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,790
<i>Do you even know
how to start this motor</i>

125
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,525
I mean, I think so.

126
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,460
Abby:
That's got sunglasses.

127
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,029
Oh, sorry.

128
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,798
<i>- 
- </i>

129
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,102
I have got this.

130
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,074
Hi.
It's a really big knot.

131
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,678
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thank you.

132
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,581
- You're welcome.
- And that's how it's done,
ladies.

133
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,784
- You got it?
- Ta-da.

134
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,553
- Here we go.
- Let's do this.

135
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,524
Here we go, guys.

136
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,837
- More to the left?
- To the right.

137
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,705
- To the right?
- There's a rock right here.

138
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,641
Yeah.

139
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,010
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

140
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,978
Oh, my God.
I don't wanna.

141
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,148
- Oh, my God! Abby!
- Oh, my God.

142
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,783
It was too soon.

143
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,019
- I'm soaked.
- Wow.

144
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,888
- Well done, woman.
- Yeah.

145
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,758
Oh, my God.

146
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,260
- Oh, my God.
- Maybe you need to
just dry off a little bit?

147
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,564
Yeah, you think?
Oh, my God.

148
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,671
- I have my smiley face on,
I have my smiley face on.
- You're good.

149
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,205
You guys did a really good job.

150
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,274
It was a really good job.
Look at that.

151
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,777
Oh, you're one
of the greats,
Sarah.

152
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,182
Did I mention that the water

153
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,185
was actually really,
really, really cold?

154
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,054
- Yup.
- Oh.

155
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,627
- Oh, my God.
- How nice is it, though, guys?

156
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,062
Look at... I mean,
look at the view,
though.

157
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,164
- I know.
- It's so beautiful.

158
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,800
It smells exactly the same.

159
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,969
It smells like childhood to me.

160
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,939
<i>Does anyone mind if I,
like, check my phone
really quick</i>

161
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,241
Is that, like,
gonna kill the mood?

162
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,144
- No, do it.
Do what you gotta do.
- 'Kay.

163
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,914
Urgent text situation.

164
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,817
No, just addicted to my phone.

165
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:22,387
Lol.
Omg.

166
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,722
I don't even think
people say that anymore.

167
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,926
Aw.

168
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,961
Whatever.

169
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,064
I don't care.
There's no reception.

170
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,833
I'm totally fine with it.

171
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,703
What are we gonna do
while we're here?

172
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,107
Is this it?

173
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,409
It's not it, is it?

174
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:48,780
<i>- No
- I have a plan. </i>

175
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,149
<i>- Like... like a Sarah plan
- Wow, wait a second. Hold up. </i>

176
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,786
- Sarah has a plan?
- Of course Sarah has a plan.

177
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,222
Okay.

178
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:00,291
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
Okay.

179
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,060
- Okay, guys.
Close your eyes.
- Okay.

180
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,965
Keep 'em closed.

181
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,200
We are

182
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,202
walking down the stairs...

183
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,405
- very dark, dark,
dark stairs...
- I'm scared.

184
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,940
Into a basement.

185
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,809
And there's Greg sr.

186
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,944
And he's there
with all his friends.

187
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,347
- We take... come on.
- I'm sorry.

188
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,015
We take him out, we sit down,

189
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,685
- and we watch a hundred times...
- "Goonies. "

190
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,888
- "Goonies"!
- Oh, my God.
You're such a dork.

191
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,290
- You brought the map
to the time capsule.
- Yes!

192
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,693
- Oh, boy. Here we go.
- Just hold on.

193
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,461
You did it.

194
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,264
- One for you, madam.
- Oh, we each get our own.

195
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,366
- One for you, missy.
- I'm excited.

196
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,201
- This is gonna help us.
- So guys, look.

197
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:46,838
- Was this it?
- This is it.

198
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,039
- Seriously?
- This is so awesome, dude.

199
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,841
This is our map.

200
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,744
- Look it. We are here.
- No, I get that we are here,

201
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,014
but, like, this isn't
gonna take us anywhere.

202
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,416
- Yeah, it is.
- Do you see what this
is showing us?

203
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,051
- Yes. No, it's pretty
self-explanatory.
- No.

204
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,020
- This is us.
- Oh, obviously.

205
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,355
- This is
Sheila beal's tits. Remember?
- And you take four dashes

206
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,492
- to the left and then you're at
the fort and the time capsule.
- Right.

207
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,495
I've checked it out.
I mean, the coordinates
are right.

208
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,131
I mean, generally.

209
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,900
- We were 10.
- I know, but it's
gonna be great.

210
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,870
- Abby, dude. Don't poo-poo it.
- Seriously, think of it like
an adventure, you guys.

211
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,372
Lou, dude. I'm good.
I'm just questioning
the, uh...

212
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:25,176
I hear that,
but it's great,
Sarah.

213
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,479
Sarah, this is great.
Let's do it.

214
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,414
- Yeah?
- Yes.

215
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,449
- Yeah?
- Hey, I am down.

216
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,251
- I am so pumped.
- Let's do it, you guys.
Let's find it.

217
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,919
- Serious.
- So...

218
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,355
- Let's go.
- But I am still so wet.

219
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,126
- I think it's northeast
and then that means...
- No, it's definitely northeast.

220
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,113
- She was really beautiful.
- Remember her?

221
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,182
I can't hear you, Sarah.

222
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,518
Sasha. The girl that was
really pretty in school.

223
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,119
- The exchange student.
She's gay.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,355
- What?
- She's gay now.

225
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,423
- I know.
- But then I was thinking
maybe, like...

226
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:15,360
- I don't know.
I'd make out with her.
- I know.

227
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,061
I was, like,
if I had to
go gay, like,

228
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,898
Sasha Warren would be
the girl, right?

229
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,468
- Where is she from?
- It was like Ukraine
or something.

230
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,873
<i>Yeah, I mean, I think
it's just, like... northeast
is straight up into... </i>

231
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,277
<i>- just gonna go up into this. .
- Lou: No, it was Denmark. </i>

232
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,479
<i>- Oh, fuck. Denmark.
- Yeah. </i>

233
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,315
- I just... I just remembered.
- I just feel like all Danish
are just, like...

234
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,317
but the truth is,
like, you just...

235
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,319
like, I would be fine
with, like, smooching,

236
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,155
but, like,
I don't know
if I could, like,

237
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,358
- you know, go the whole hog.
- There's the tree.

238
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,094
Oh, the tree
that looks like
Abby taking a dump.

239
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:53,865
You guys,
it doesn't even
look like that at all.

240
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,100
It's just,
like, it's a tree...
it's a stump.

241
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,536
No, but it's definitely
like a... um...

242
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,039
- It's like a bent-over shape.
- Silhouette.

243
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,227
Guys, I think we should
just throw it in.

244
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,329
We're not gonna find
this fucking fort.

245
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,899
- No, I think it's...
- It's just... yeah, that's part
of the adventure, Abby.

246
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,401
- Just go with it.
- Well, it was really fun
when we were 10,

247
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:32,437
<i>but now I'm just getting
eaten alive by mosquitos. </i>

248
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,005
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

249
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,007
- Huh?
- Not you. You.

250
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,375
You're rolling
your eyes at me,
what?

251
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,079
- Um...
- What is your problem?

252
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,048
<i>- I don't have a problem, Abby
- I'm sensing a serious
attitude here. </i>

253
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,317
- What is going... what?
- You are honestly
sensing attitude

254
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,920
<i>- from me at this point?
- Mm-hmm. I am. </i>

255
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,989
- I...
- You know, you don't need
Sarah's permission

256
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,157
to just tell me
what's on your mind.

257
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,194
Abby, please.
Like, let's just...

258
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,996
we're out here, you know,

259
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,331
it's so fucking beautiful,
right?

260
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,300
<i>I mean, we haven't
been here in so long. </i>

261
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,169
Look, Sarah doesn't have cancer.
That's good. That's...

262
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,505
<i>- Like, let's go
have some fun.
- I agree. </i>

263
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,440
I think we should
just keep going.

264
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,309
I wanna know
what the fuck
your problem is, Lou.

265
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,444
Oh, my God.
Are we really
gonna do this?

266
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,646
Do what?

267
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,951
Abigail, come on.
It was fucking ages ago
and I apologized.

268
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,253
Oh, no, no, no.
I wasn't even talking
about that.

269
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,656
<i>- Oh, really
- Yeah, I'm totally over it.
I'm great. </i>

270
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:27,158
You're clearly not over it.
Can we just call that out?

271
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,127
<i>- You are the one
that brought it up.
- I brought it up</i>

272
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,229
because you are making it
very difficult for us to just,

273
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,197
like, have a nice time
right now.

274
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,934
Because of some stupid
indiscretion that happened,
like, six years ago.

275
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,635
- Oh, is that how
you see that?
- Yes.

276
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,138
You really see
fucking my boyfriend
of two years...

277
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,573
the guy who I was pretty sure
I was probably gonna marry
maybe someday...

278
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,343
<i>you thought that was just
a small, stupid indiscretion</i>

279
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,313
We were children at that point
and we were both fucking drunk
and the guy was,

280
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,349
honestly, like
a class-a douchebag.

281
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,518
Like, you should be thanking me
that you didn't walk down
the aisle with that guy.

282
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,219
All right, well, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

283
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,522
Thank you so much, Lou,
for fucking my boyfriend.

284
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,490
- I don't mean it like...
- I appreciate it with all of...

285
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,392
- I feel really badly about it.
- You were my best friend

286
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,727
and if you're calling him
a douchebag,

287
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,229
I would love to know
what the fuck that makes you.

288
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,266
<i>Lou: I don't even know
why we're talking about it
still at this point</i>

289
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,635
because you have
this amazing life.

290
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,570
You're fucking married.
You're married.

291
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,573
Don't... don't talk like
you know anything about
my life right now.

292
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,742
- You are not a part
of my life, Lou.
- Why even...

293
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,011
- you have not been a part of my
life for a really long time.
- That is your doing.

294
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,579
- And do you wanna know why?
- That's your doing.

295
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,482
Because you never,
ever apologized.

296
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,486
- I have apologized
to you thousands of times...
- You said you were sorry

297
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,189
<i>- and you never meant it!
Never!
- What?!</i>

298
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,758
<i>- You would look at me like
I was stupid and overreacting
- Just can't win. </i>

299
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,227
- And taking it too far.
- You took a fucking
sledgehammer...

300
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,729
<i>- yeah, I wanted to take it
to your goddamn fucking face!
- You fucking threw it... </i>

301
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,031
- okay, guys!
- You wanna go in...

302
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,499
- yes! I would love to fucking
smash your face in!
- Guys, guys, guys!

303
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,769
- No, if there's a time
to do it, do it now.
- No.

304
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,571
- Guys, stop it.
- I would love to, Lou.

305
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,139
- All right, well,
then, bring it.
- Please.

306
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,774
- Great.
- Stop it, guys.
This is crazy.

307
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:54,112
- Just take a fucking time-out.
- I agree that it's crazy.

308
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:56,247
- Great, I'm the crazy one.
- Guys, please, please, please,

309
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,249
- just stop.
- I'm a crazy fucking bitch.

310
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,451
Dude... I know.
I mean, this is
just, like...

311
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,488
- this is just... cannot.
- She started it.

312
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,291
Can I say that?
Let's go, let's go
chase Abby

313
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,260
'cause she's got a problem.

314
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,098
<i></i>

315
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:20,638
<i>Lou: I feel like
all three of us in this tent
is not gonna be good. </i>

316
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,573
All things considered.

317
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,375
I know.

318
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,615
<i>I mean, obviously this went
a lot different in my head. </i>

319
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,317
- You know, we were
having fun and...
- I know.

320
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,486
- I'm sorry.
- This is so crazy

321
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,388
because when I think about
the three of us,

322
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,190
like, back in the day...

323
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,827
I feel like
we were the crazy ones
and she was, like, sweet.

324
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,430
- She was sweet Abby
and now she's crazy Abby.
- She has been acting

325
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,632
really... I don't know.
She's just been off.

326
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,234
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

327
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,704
She just doesn't wanna talk
about it, which, as you know,
for Abby, is really weird.

328
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,706
Yeah.
Jesus.

329
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,647
I mean, the truth is,
though, what happened
was pretty fucked up.

330
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:05,283
- Yeah, I know, Sarah. I know.
- Yeah, I know you know.

331
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,218
I know you know
and I'm not trying
to take sides,

332
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,587
- but I'm just... Lou,
I'm trying to put a certain
- Oh, my God.

333
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,090
Perspective on it
where I'm looking at
someone over there

334
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,158
who's really,
really, really hurt.

335
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,861
And I know for you,
you were young and whatever
and you're...

336
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:20,398
- yeah.
- I know and you've moved
past it and I can look at it

337
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,301
and I can be past it,
but it didn't happen to me.

338
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,470
Like, I think for her,
it was a game changer.

339
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,382
Okay, um...

340
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,620
Excuse me.

341
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,291
So...

342
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:23,227
I'm just gonna...

343
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,196
I'm just gonna sit here...

344
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,934
And...

345
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,438
You can say
whatever you
wanna say to me.

346
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,442
You wanna call me names or...

347
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,314
Get up in my face.

348
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,649
- I'm just gonna sit here.
-

349
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,284
<i>Lou:
What?! What?!</i>

350
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,852
- Whoa, whoa.
- What the fuck is that? Fuck!

351
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,654
<i>- What is that?
- What is it, what is it</i>

352
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,756
- Nothing, it's nothing.
- Three hunters up there.

353
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,891
<i>- Are you guys all right
- Sorry, it was really scary. </i>

354
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,660
- Jesus Christ. Hey.
- Hey.

355
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,963
<i>- Hi.
- Hey. </i>

356
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,932
Um...

357
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,271
<i>Is that Henry? Is that...
i think I know that guy. </i>

358
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,840
- Shut up.
- Is that Henry Wallace?

359
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:13,244
- Yeah.
- That is crazy.

360
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,379
You scared
the living shit
out of us.

361
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,882
I, um... I'm Lou.

362
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,551
Louise.
I'm Louise foster.

363
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,254
<i>I went to milbridge elementary
school together. </i>

364
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,523
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Okay. </i>

365
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,625
- You... you do. Yes, you do.
- I don't know...

366
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,595
Sorry. This is
Abby Turner...
oh, my God.

367
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:33,464
- And Sarah Whitfield.
- Hi.

368
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:37,301
We... we went to...
we went to grammar school
with your older brother Jimmy.

369
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,371
We're, like, a couple years
ahead of you. You guys know
it's Jimmy Wallace.

370
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,406
- Jimmy... Jimmy Wallace's
little brother.
- Oh.

371
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,342
- Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, Lou... Lou.
- And that's Henry.

372
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,511
- Yeah.
- I think Jim had a crush
on you back then.

373
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:50,014
- You used to have
the pigtails, right?
- Yeah. I always had the...

374
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,483
wow. Why do you
remember that?
That's bizarre.

375
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:54,452
Uh, these are my buddies.
This is Derek and Alex.

376
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:56,354
- Lou: Hey.
- Hello.

377
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,723
- Hey.
- So... so what are you girls
doing out here anyways?

378
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,558
I mean, nobody
comes out here anymore.

379
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,027
<i>You're lucky you didn't
get shot, you know</i>

380
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,529
We were shooting deer
not, what, like, 200 yards
from here yesterday?

381
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,665
Is it hunting season?

382
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,300
What?

383
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:16,707
Well, we are just camping here.

384
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,610
- Yeah.
- Just for a couple
of days and...

385
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,911
what?

386
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,014
How is the hunting going?
Is it good?

387
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:25,950
It's not too good.

388
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,918
Well, we were,
uh... we were gonna
eat what we killed,

389
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,055
and, uh, well, so far
we ain't ate a thing.

390
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,424
- 
- Oh. Sucks.

391
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,992
<i>- Yeah.
- All right. </i>

392
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,361
I killed a lot of spaghettios

393
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,931
and we've got a shit ton
of liquor, so...

394
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:43,701
<i>You guys wanna join us maybe</i>

395
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,469
Oh, um...

396
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,941
So how is your brother?

397
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,744
Uh, my brother's
good. He's good.

398
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,514
- He's got three kids.
- Oh, man.

399
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,950
- Yeah, and he's still fishing.
- Of course.

400
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,653
- Yeah, we actually took
his boat out here.
- Cool.

401
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,757
Is he still cute?

402
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,995
Um...
Is he still cute?

403
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:13,564
Well, I mean, he's weighing in
at three bills now, so I...

404
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,933
- what? Are you serious?
- If you're into that
kind of thing.

405
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,034
- Yeah.
- Like where?

406
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,737
That's, like, so fat.

407
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,373
- Didn't you give
him a blowjob?
- Oh, my God.

408
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,842
You totally gave
Jimmy Wallace
a blowjob.

409
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,978
I totally remember that
and was I not supposed
to say it out loud?

410
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,880
- I...
- But she did.

411
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,849
- She did.
- If we're counting.

412
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,685
- It was
a hand job, but, um...
- Hey, so I don't even want

413
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,388
- to interrupt
or anything, but...
- My lips are sealed.

414
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,457
- 
I like your beard.
- Wow.

415
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,493
- I do. I like this whole thing.
- Thank you.

416
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:44,662
- It's very sexy.
- Thank you very much.

417
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:48,432
<i>- Very, verytrès chic.
- Thank you. </i>

418
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,068
You have this
whole look going on

419
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,970
and I gotta tell you,
it works...

420
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,972
- Thanks.
- ... For you.

421
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,974
<i>- Well, it's just kind of...
- It's very cute. </i>

422
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:59,577
- I haven't shaved
in a while, you know?
- Yeah, though, it's, like,

423
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,379
effortless.

424
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,081
I mean, seriously.
You should get
one of these

425
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,851
<i>'cause you have a baby face. </i>

426
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,086
- He looks good with a beard.
- But it's, you know...

427
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,522
can you grow a beard?

428
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,791
Well...

429
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:16,460
- Anyways, your beard is cute
and I like it.
- Thank you.

430
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,062
I like it a lot.

431
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,465
So, listen.
How's your family doing?

432
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,834
They're good, they're good.

433
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:26,904
My mom and dad actually
moved to Florida recently.

434
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,740
<i>- Oh, right on.
- Which I'm sort of
so-so about, but... </i>

435
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,876
<i>- yeah?
- Yeah. </i>

436
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,612
- No, no, no. That's totally
cool. I mean, you can't...
- Yeah.

437
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,647
You can't blame them for getting
out of these winters and...

438
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:37,982
<i>- Yeah.
- Abby: I went to Florida
one time</i>

439
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:41,018
and it was really hot.

440
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,822
<i>- It was really hot in Florida
- It's warm, right</i>

441
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,157
<i>- You go
- Yeah. </i>

442
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,828
It makes me wanna take
my clothes off.

443
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,431
<i>- Abby.
- It does. </i>

444
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:57,568
- Abby. Abby.
- You take your clothes off
all the time when it's hot.

445
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,103
<i>- Seriously, I wanna talk
to you for a second.
- Am I wrong</i>

446
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,005
- Come have a chat
with me in the tent.
- No, I'm so good.

447
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,673
I need to put on
some warming clothes
and I want you to talk to me.

448
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,675
You should put on
some warming clothes.

449
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,677
I'm going to put on some
warming clothes, but I wanna
tell you a secret as well.

450
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,612
- So come here for a second.
- Shh.

451
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,014
- Secrets.
- Secrets.

452
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:12,583
- I'm coming back.
- Right on.

453
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,623
- What?
- What's going on?

454
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,159
What do you mean
what is going on?
Nothing.

455
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,161
- What do you mean nothing?
- I'm talking to Lou.

456
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:27,097
what are you doing with Henry?
'Cause that's...

457
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,099
<i>- he's so cute.
- Dude, come on. </i>

458
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:32,503
I mean, he's so young.
Like, don't you miss that...
being, like...

459
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,505
Abby, you're married.
You know what I mean?

460
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,040
- You know what?
Don't even.
- I'm just...

461
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,942
- I'm just trying
to protect you
- No, no, no, no.

462
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,677
As a friend
because it's, like...

463
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,646
Mike... nonissue, okay?

464
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,582
- I don't want you
to worry about it.
- What does that even mean?

465
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,183
- I am so good.
- Dude, what is...

466
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,152
<i>dude, what does that even mean,
it's a nonissue</i>

467
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,154
I just mean,
don't worry about it.

468
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,590
- It's all good. This is so fun.
Thank you so much.
- Abby, Abby, Abby.

469
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,924
<i>- Thank you so much.
- Fuck. </i>

470
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:57,061

- Guess who?

472
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,799
- Um, I'm gonna go
with Abby on this one.
- Guess who?

473
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,568
Guess who?
It's so Abby.

474
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,504
- Hi.
- It was totally me.

475
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,738
- Yeah, I know.
- It was totally me.

476
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,607
- I'm good at that.
- So me.

477
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,042
<i>- I'm having so much fun.
- I'm glad. </i>

478
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,944
<i>- I don't have... this is fun.
- What's going on</i>

479
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,246
<i>I just... I love this. </i>

480
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:17,615
- God, Lou.
- Cheers.

481
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,917
- Yeah?
- You look older, but, like...
you look... you're still you,

482
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,919
- and I love that.
- Thanks.

483
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:24,288
- So happy.
- Abby.

484
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,291
- I'm so happy.
- So the wood situation is low.

485
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:29,860
Maybe we should beef it up.

486
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,896
- You guys need
some wood? I can go...
- Yeah, I can go.

487
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,163
- No, no, no.
I have no problem.
- No, no.

488
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,865
- Do you wanna go...
- No.

489
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,301
- Use me. I can go get wood.
- No, I am... here's the deal.

490
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:40,104
- I got wood before.
- Okay.

491
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,540
'Kay, 'cause I'm,
like, a wood expert

492
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,009
and I know there's
all these secret spots.

493
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,177
I have a flashlight

494
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,213
- and I know the secret spots.
- Honestly, I don't mind
going by myself.

495
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,749
- I know. It's fine.
- Hi.

496
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:55,319
- Gonna go, gonna go, gonna go.
- Awesome. Be careful out there.

497
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,254
- I'm gonna be so careful.
- You'll be good.

498
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,657
- I'm gonna be so careful,
it's gonna be crazy.
- Take a walk...

499
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:02,259
just walk it off.

500
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,561
- I'll be back, though.
- She knows her stuff.

501
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,895
Okay.

502
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,265
- Wow, she's friendly.
- She is friendly.

503
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,167
That is something that she is.

504
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,570
It's fine. You know,
she seems harmless

505
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,672
and, you know, just having fun.

506
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,274
- Do you need another drink?
I feel like that might...
- No, yeah.

507
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:19,743
I'm getting a little low.
That'd be great.

508
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,111
A little Sandy.

509
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,624
Um... a little Sandy,
but there you go.

510
00:26:33,626 --> 00:26:35,593
Oh, no worries.
It's perfect.
Thank you.

511
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:38,829
So where do you guys...
where do you guys all know
each other from?

512
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:40,831
Uh...

513
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,835
<i>I mean, we were all...
we all served together. </i>

514
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:48,706
- Like, you...
- We all served in
the military together in,

515
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:51,175
<i>- uh, the army.
- Oh, I didn't realize that. </i>

516
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:56,013
Where'd you...
like, where'd you...
how would I say that?

517
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:58,282
You know, I'm sorry.
Excuse me. I'm gonna go
take a leak.

518
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,317
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, right on.

519
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:02,086
- Yeah.
- Do whatever
you gotta do.

520
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,132
So you guys were...
you guys served together?

521
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,935
- Yup.
- Yeah, yeah.

522
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,771
Two deployments Iraq,
one in Afghanistan.

523
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,807
Right on.

524
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,110
Um, how long ago?

525
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:29,647
How long have you guys...
how long ago were
you guys there?

526
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,983
- We've been back,
what, three weeks now?
- 18 days.

527
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,153
<i>- 18 days?
- Mm-hmm. </i>

528
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,288
- That's crazy.
- I didn't think
you were gonna say that.

529
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,324
<i>- That is...
- Not long at all. </i>

530
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,926
<i>No, that's... wow. </i>

531
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,233
That's crazy.

532
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,105
Hey, where are you?

533
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,942
Hey, psst.

534
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,878
Where'd you go?

535
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,147
Hey. Where did you go?

536
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,749
- I got you.
- You got me.

537
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,217
- Shh.
- What?

538
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,119
- Why?
- 'Cause I have a secret.

539
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,888
- What's your secret?
- Come here.

540
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,405
Oh, wow.
You really taste good.

541
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:31,241
Oh.

542
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,943
- See, man.
- It's been awhile.

543
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,812
- I still got it.
- Yeah.

544
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,047
- I got this, man.
- Yeah, you got this.

545
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,450
- I am not an uptight bitch.
- No, no, no.

546
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:42,152
- I'm fun, right?
- Yeah, you're a lot of fun.

547
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,754
- Fun.
- Hey.

548
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:45,756
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna have fun?

549
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:48,025
Kind of.

550
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,198
Mm.

551
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,302
- You know, I, um...
- What?

552
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:01,472
- I don't feel great...
- Wait, wait, wait.

553
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,874
And I think maybe
I should go down
to the beach

554
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,109
- and get...
- What happened
to having fun, Abby?

555
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,311
Oh, no.
That was so fun.
So fun.

556
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,950
I feel like...
I wanna know
what I am, you know?

557
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,253
- 
- Fuck.

558
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,021
- Ow. God, Henry.
- Are you all right?

559
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,790
- It hurt.
- Sorry, I slipped.

560
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,532
Henry wouldn't
tell you this,
but he...

561
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,434
I mean, he'd deny it.

562
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,903
Just flat out, but he
saved both our lives.

563
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,307
Hell, he saved
the whole squad
in helmand province.

564
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,813
Wow.

565
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,184
<i>What happened</i>

566
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,791
We got, uh...

567
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,959
we came up on a bunker
that we thought
was abandoned

568
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,362
and it was just a bad report.

569
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,297
<i>Before we knew it,
we were just... </i>

570
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,968
Getting shot at.

571
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,070
- Shit.
- Henry Wallace.

572
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:08,472
- Yeah.
- You know, like,
little Henry Wallace.

573
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,340
I... I...

574
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:14,144
usually when you hear
about a local hero,

575
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,014
you see it in the headlines,
and I just had no idea.

576
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:19,850
<i>- I didn't hear
anything about that.
- Yeah, well. </i>

577
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:23,453
<i>- I would have heard about him.
- Our superiors didn't really
approve of our tactics. </i>

578
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:29,059
Sometimes you can't
go by the book,
you know?

579
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:32,296
I mean, you can't
follow every single rule.

580
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,364
Shit gets outta hand.

581
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,533
You gotta do
what you gotta do
to get the job done.

582
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,576
They sent us back home...


583
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,477
Dishonorable discharge.

584
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,281
<i>No fucking medals.
</i>

585
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,950
No shit.

586
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:56,086
But I'll tell you what.

587
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,556
The fucking government...
they may not say it,

588
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,625
but, Henry, boy,

589
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:03,227
he's still a fucking hero.

590
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:04,494
Fuck, yeah, he is.

591
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,135
I...

592
00:31:12,137 --> 00:31:14,504
oh, Henry, stop.
Can you get off?

593
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,174
Can you just get off me
for a second?

594
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,910
- Just get off me.
- Oh, no.

595
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,111
Get off me, Henry.

596
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:29,386
- 
- You wanna have some
fucking fun, baby?

597
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,255
All right,
let's have some
fucking fun.

598
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,556
What do you think
about this, huh?

599
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,524
You wanna get fucked tonight?

600
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,561
Are you ready to get fucked?
Do you wanna have some
fucking fun?

601
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,330
Let's have some fucking fun,

What'd you do to him?!

- Henry, it's Derek.

00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,703
You fucking killed him!

641
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,141
- Fucking run!
-

642
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,776
This bitch!
I swear to God!

643
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,014
No, no, no!


644
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,384
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no! Stop it!

645
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,452
- Stop! Stop it!
-

646
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,731
Can you use your head?

647
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,366
Use your fucking head.

648
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,221
Sarah, Sarah.

649
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,190
- Wake up.
- Oh, my God.

650
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,662
<i>Shit. </i>

651
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,365
<i>Lou, Lou. </i>

652
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,640
Part of me wants to
do this shit...

653
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,475
just fucking haji style, bro.

654
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:41,211
Just saw their
fucking heads off.

655
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,412
Calm the fuck down,
Derek, okay?

656
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:44,081
Let's just think about this.
Just for a second.

657
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,216
What is there
to fucking think about?

658
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,285
You think I didn't...
you think I didn't want to beat
them to a fucking bloody pulp?

659
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,353
I did!
We both did.

660
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,422
Now all I'm saying

661
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,591
is let's just think
about this, all right?

662
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,328
They're just... they're just
fucking girls, okay?

663
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,197
They're girls.
They're somebody's daughter.

664
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,498
They're somebody's sister.

665
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,433
They're not fucking haji.

666
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,336
That bitch killed Henry.

667
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,439
- Fuck, man.
- He's fucking dead, Alex.

668
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,576
What the fuck do you wanna do?

669
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,479
Never...

670
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:19,549
We gotta get outta here.
Can you get your hands free?

671
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,853
No.
I'm totally stuck.

672
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:26,556
- Are you?
- These fucking...

673
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,425
are you ready to die, bitch?

674
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,130
Okay, guys.
I'm gonna talk to him.

675
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,266
<i>- I'm going. - Abby:
What are you gonna say</i>

676
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,268
<i>I'm just gonna talk to them. </i>

677
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,770
I'm gonna look at 'em
and I'm gonna talk to 'em.

678
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,778
Okay, okay, guys, okay.

679
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,616
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

680
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,584
<i>- Derek, listen.
- Shut up. Shut up. </i>

681
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:57,721
- What happened to Henry was
a terrible, terrible...
- Shut up.

682
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,756
Fucking mistake, okay?

683
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,159
<i>It was an accident.
Abby is sorry. </i>

684
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:05,562
She is sorry, but please,

685
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:09,833
understand that what she did
was protecting herself.

686
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,602
<i>Can you get that
She thought that he
was going to rape her. </i>

687
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,472
Can you understand that?
Can you get that?

688
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,407
Here's what I get.
Your fucking slut friend

689
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,476
<i>lures my buddy up into
the woods... </i>

690
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,244
<i>flirting with him all night. </i>

691
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:24,181
<i>Smashes his fucking head in
with a rock. </i>

692
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:27,417
That's what I understand.

693
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,953
- 
Okay, okay. You're right.
- That's what I understand.

694
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:32,389
<i>- You're right.
- Okay</i>

695
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:34,591
Let's go to the police.
Let's tell them everything...

696
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:38,228
We'll just...
you can fucking tell them
whatever you want.

697
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,197
<i>Listen to me!
Listen!</i>

698
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,269
Don't cry.
Don't fucking cry.

699
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,407
You fucking pussy.

700
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:56,546
What did you say?

701
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,617
You gotta tie up three girls
to a tree to kill them?

702
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,353
- I think you're
a fucking pussy!
-

703
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:05,488
- If we're gonna do this, man,
let's just fucking do it.
- Hold on a second.

704
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,823
- Let's just fucking do it, man.
- Hold on a second.

705
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,892
Wait, wait.

706
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,564
Do you think I'm scared of you?

707
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,534
Whoa, fuck.

708
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:28,445
She's got some spunk.

709
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,249
How 'bout you fucking untie me

710
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,984
like a real man?

711
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:36,920
<i>How 'bout you fucking untie me
and let me show you?!</i>

712
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,956
- I will show you what I can do!
- Shut the fuck up!

713
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,524
- I will show you!
- Shut up!

714
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,636
<i>- This is fucking crazy.
You fucking kidding me?
- Watch this, watch this. </i>

715
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,838
<i>- You're fucking kidding me.
- Watch this. </i>

716
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,606
- You got a move?
- Huh?

717
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,477
- 
- Go!

718
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,045
- 
- Ah!

719
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,880
- Go! Run!
- Up the hill!

720
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,349
<i>- Get her up the fucking hill!
- Go, go!</i>

721
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,868
<i></i>

722
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,912

724
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,696
<i></i>

725
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,767
<i></i>

726
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,842
<i>We been hunting shoddy jihad
for three fucking years. </i>

727
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,414
<i>What the fuck makes you think
this comes out good for you</i>

728
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,041
- Derek.
- Yeah.

729
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,777
- What the fuck you doing?
- What?

730
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,478
What the fuck is...
why'd you do that?

731
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,447
Why'd you let 'em go, huh?

732
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,582
You said you were
gonna kill 'em and now
we're gonna have to.

733
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,051
- Huh, you fucking moron?
- Jesus, don't worry.

734
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:24,521
We'll find 'em.

735
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,923
We came out here to hunt.
We'll just hunt 'em down.

736
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,160
Do you hear that?

737
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,731
<i>We're gonna find you!</i>

738
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,704
And I'm gonna kill you!

739
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,545
It's on.

740
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,568
I'm gonna kill
all three of you!

741
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,905
<i>One by one!</i>

742
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:52,642
<i>With my bare fucking hands
if I have to!</i>

743
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,083
<i></i>

744
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,207
<i></i>

745
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,125
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God, you guys.

746
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,997
I didn't think
I was gonna see
you guys again.

747
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,099
- We're alive.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

748
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:04,267
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

749
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:07,036
- Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

750
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,771
- Are you okay?
- Are you?

751
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:11,274
<i>Abby:
Oh, my God, you guys.
I am so scared. </i>

752
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:14,077
I am so sorry.
I don't know what happened
last night.

753
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,179
- I just...
- No, no, no.

754
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:17,947
- It went so far
and I messed up.
- Abby...

755
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,717
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- This is not your fault.

756
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,419
- Abby, it's not your fault.
- This is crazy.

757
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:25,354
This is not your fault.

758
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:29,292
- No, no, no, no.
-

759
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,730
Okay, you did what
you thought you had to do

760
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:36,466
in order to survive, okay?

761
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:39,435
<i>Listen, listen, guys, listen. </i>

762
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:43,406
We are on a small island
and we need to get off.

763
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,174
We need to figure out
what to do.

764
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,879
Maybe...

765
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:52,381
<i>We can stay here</i>

766
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,417
'cause they don't know
where we are here.

767
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,187
The woods are dense and...

768
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:01,224
and maybe they'll
go away, you know?

769
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:03,459
No.

770
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,128
<i>- No.
- They're not going away. </i>

771
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,230
Lou, they're not going away.
Did you see them?

772
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,901
- Yeah.
- They're not gonna stop.

773
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,936
No.

774
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,505
We have to get to our boat.

775
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,178
They'll wait
for us at the campsite.
They know exactly where it is.

776
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,046
They have a boat.
Let's get their boat.

777
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:26,382
- It's Jimmy's boat.
- But where is it, Lou?

778
00:46:26,384 --> 00:46:29,018
- We can't just
walk around the island.
- We're not gonna go traipsing

779
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,989
- around the island
'cause they'll find us.
- Okay, okay, okay.

780
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,161
Okay.

781
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,329
<i>We need to think
of something. </i>

782
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,931
We wait until it's dark.

783
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,271
We wait until it's dark
and we go to our boat.

784
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,441
<i>- Let's do that.
- Okay. </i>

785
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,345
So we just wait.

786
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,019
<i></i>

787
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:04,987
Did you hear that?

788
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,350
<i>There it is. </i>

789
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:11,053
Okay.

790
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:19,562
- They cut the rope.
- Damn it.

791
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,230
- How far do you
think it's out there?
- Abby: I don't know.

792
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,033
<i>It's far, you know
It's far. </i>

793
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:26,936
Tide's going out.
If anything, it's probably
going further away.

794
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:29,505
<i>- Lou: We can swim that.
We can swim that.
- No. </i>

795
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,240
No, we cannot
fucking swim that.

796
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,042
Are you fucking crazy?
It's freezing.

797
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:36,379
We get hypothermia
in less than 15 minutes
in fucking August.

798
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:40,049
It's not that far.
We can do this.
We have to.

799
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,519
<i>What else are we gonna
fucking do</i>

800
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:46,055
No, guys. We'll fucking
die in that water.

801
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,961
<i>Abby:
I'm a good swimmer.
I can do this. </i>

802
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:55,464
You guys go back to the fort.

803
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:57,500
You stay safe.
You stay covered.

804
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,168
I'll get to the boat,
get to the mainland,

805
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,037
and come back with the cops.

806
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,239
<i>There is no sense

01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:18,834
Feel so unhinged, you know?

981
01:02:25,007 --> 01:02:26,975
I left Mike.

982
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,981
I hadn't even told Sarah yet.

983
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,490
And... the stuff

984
01:02:41,492 --> 01:02:44,126
with you and me...

985
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:47,362
You know, I know that...

986
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:51,032
I've held onto that
for a really long time.

987
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,938
I just...

988
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,407
I always felt
like it was so much...

989
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:02,410
Easier to blame you for...

990
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:06,214
Things not working out...

991
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:09,217
Than it was to just...

992
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:13,088
Admit that maybe
I had messed it up.

993
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,856
It's easier to put it on you.

994
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,362
I'm really sorry.

995
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,434
- Good.

That must be their boat. </i>

997
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,438
Down there.

998
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,510
I don't see the other one.

999
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,614
Neither do I.

1000
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:50,018
- Are we gonna do this?
- Yup.

1001
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:54,456
If we're gonna do it,
we've gotta do it right now.

1002
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,462
- Yup.
- I'll fucking do it.

1003
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:02,063

- No, no.

I wanna do it.
I wanna do it.

1005
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:07,569
Oh, God.
You cover my back, okay?

1006
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,337
You keep your fucking eyes out
for that other guy,

1007
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,573
and if he comes,
you cover my back.

1008
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,341
I got your back.

1009
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,179

Okay.

1011
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,155
Is there... do I...
do I hit a vein?

1012
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:29,658
- Is there a vein
in there that I need...
- You're gonna take this

1013
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:33,461
and you're gonna puncture
his fucking vein here

1014
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,597
and you're gonna
pull it across.

1015
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,565
Hard.

1016
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,469
Okay. Okay.

1017
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:53,214
Listen to me, Abigail.

1018
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:55,450
Look at me.
You're gonna
fucking do this.

1019
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,419
I got to.
I'm gonna do it.

1020
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:59,254
You're gonna
fucking slit
his throat.

1021
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:00,989
I'm gonna
fucking slit
his throat.

1022
