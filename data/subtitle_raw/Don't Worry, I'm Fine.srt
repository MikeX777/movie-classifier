00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,113
Coming! I'll get my bag.

3
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,350
It's that one.

4
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,036
Thanks.

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,073
Don't Worry, I'm Fine

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,748
Hi, my love.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,870
Not too long?

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,355
And how. Almost 11 hours.

9
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,639
My parents... Léa.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,434
Paris, August 25th

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,029
Thomas... Lili.

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,676
Her parents.

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,474
- Phone you tomorrow.
- Yes. And stop by!

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,830
Bye.

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,829
We're this way.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,190
- I love that girl.
- She seems nice, yes.

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,989
I love that girl.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,350
- She's older than you, no?
- She's 25.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,232
Seen how cute she is?

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,109
She's in grad school. Doing her PhD.

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,118
- What's that?
- Comes after your Masters.

22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,950
Beats my dumb diploma.

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,628
Your brother left.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,673
- He came home? He enjoy his vac?
- I don't know.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,948
Where did he go?

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,151
We don't know. It's been 5 days.

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,679
What happened?

28
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,074
We had a row.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,669
He's mad at me.
Didn't he call you?

30
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,235
No. Yes, 2 weeks ago.
Why did you fight?

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,270
Over nothing.

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,075
Tell me!

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,998
Over nothing. Over his room.

34
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,390
- You don't know where he is?
- No.

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,953
Loïc, it's me.

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,151
I'm back.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,831
Call me. Big hug.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,911
What's that guy up to?

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,277
Traffic's backed up
all around Paris...

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,550
For 20 miles on the A6 freeway...

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,672
Things are also crawling on the A10,

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,668
all the way to the beltway...

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,113
Not having a shower?

44
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,478
He didn't leave me a note.

45
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,079
He just took off.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,837
What's all the fuss
about his room? It's tidy.

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,073
I tidied it.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,834
Stop it, Mom.
You know how Loïc is.

49
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,840
He's impulsive,
but it doesn't last.

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,070
Yeah.

51
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,631
- Dinner's ready.
- Coming.

52
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,870
Hi, it's Loïc. Leave a message.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,230
It's me. Why haven't you called?

54
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,872
Dunno what happened,
but they're upset.

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,677
Call me. Big hug.

56
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,913
You spoke Spanish
with your girlfriend?

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,192
Sure I did. A month in Spain,
you speak Spanish.

58
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,188
Many French kids?

59
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,075
Lots. 2 Lyon girls,
a great guy from Brittany.

60
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,350
So you learned Breton!

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,680
You stayed in Barcelona?
No side trips?

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,872
To the coast, once.
But Barcelona's too much!

63
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,715
In Franco's day it was cop city.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,956
Wasn't "too much" for us, huh?

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,116
Yes.

66
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,353
- Here.
- Thanks.

67
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,468
You didn't eat?

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,437
He took his guitar...

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,759
His accoustic.

70
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,836
Yes.

71
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,317
What really happened?

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,236
Can't be about his room,
it's been a mess for years.

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,674
It was...

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,429
Got ugly, I expected a fist-fight.

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,108
You know them. Want some tea?

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,270
Coming?

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,035
I'm going for a walk!

78
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,355
At this hour?

79
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,790
...Clouds over the English Channel,

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,596
and storms moving toward Italy.

81
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,270
- Was it nice?
- Fabulous!

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,349
I want to go right back.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,757
- Seen Loïc?
- Is he back?

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,589
Yes, but he stormed back out.
Didn't he call you?

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,910
No.

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,232
He doesn't call every day.

87
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,670
So you didn't go with him?

88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,673
No, Camille made me go hiking.

89
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,076
Wish I'd gone climbing with him.

90
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,759
Wanna hear what we did?

91
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,196
I mean, what he did.

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,838
No idea where he is?

93
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,748
He must've found a chick...

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,077
He wrote this one for you.

95
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,872
It's called "Lili".

96
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,472
Hi, girl!

97
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,193
- Things OK?
- And you?

98
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,998
Weird being here, huh?

99
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,316
What is it?

100
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,559
Boring stuff.

101
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,918
"Power politics in Mozambique".

102
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,394
Guess I like boring stuff.

103
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,318
- Miss?
- Same for me.

104
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,595
I just found a part-time job.

105
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,710
What is it?

106
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,876
Cashier in the local supermarket.

107
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,308
That's OK.

108
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,793
You here, Froggie?

109
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,389
Skies are blue, we can take it easy.

110
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
- "Froggie" means I'm a weatherman.
- I know.

111
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,110
Right.

112
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,993
After a month with her,
you know everything.

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,996
Nonsense.

114
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,716
I hate knowing the weather.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,319
Me, too.

116
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,750
The fun is seeing it all
from up high:

117
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,474
Patagonia, Vladivostok.

118
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,352
But he just does local weather.

119
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,354
With satellites,
you can see the world.

120
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,348
The other day, we spent 2 hours
over the Azores watching whales.

121
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,834
I love whales!

122
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,668
What is it?

123
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,233
What's wrong, Lili?

124
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,475
Nothing.

125
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,073
It's just...

126
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,559
My brother split.

127
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,359
Your twin?

128
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,279
He'll be back,

129
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,672
but he hasn't called me,

130
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,117
and I don't know why.

131
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,874
Split, how?

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,877
He had a row with my dad.

133
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,392
When I got back,

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,794
he was gone.

135
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,039
Has he walked out before?

136
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,672
No, but they fight all time.

137
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,751
He can't stand all this...

138
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,997
This burb, Vigneux, our parents.

139
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,350
He's been gone 6 days.

140
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,589
He'll come back, don't worry.

141
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,272
You from Vigneux?

142
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,875
I'm from nearby, Draveil.

143
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,550
You went to Montgeron high school?

144
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,709
My brother, too.

145
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,635
I went there too,
up to my senior year.

146
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,794
Funny, huh?

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,115
Anyway...

148
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,429
Sorry.

149
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,596
He'll call you, don't worry.

150
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,469
Hi.

151
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,436
Commuter train was stifling.

152
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,870
You OK?

153
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,789
What did you do today?

154
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,195
What happened, Dad?

155
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,390
What do you mean?

156
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,398
You must know!
He didn't leave over his room!

157
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,636
What happened?

158
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,960
- Tell me, I want to know!
- Nothing happened.

159
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,759
Just what you were told.

160
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,277
I don't believe you, tell me!

161
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,469
I told you, Elise.

162
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,632
- I don't believe you!
- Stop it, Lili.

163
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,196
Loïc has vanished.
He may be in trouble!

164
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,875
You do nothing:

165
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,033
go to work, read your mail!

166
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,153
He left because of you!

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,070
What can I do, kid?

168
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,840
Go to the police! Isn't it time?

169
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,515
I already went.

170
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,234
- When?
- I forget, a week ago.

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,228
And?

172
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,431
Nothing. I said he'd left.

173
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,675
What did they say?

174
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,115
Answer, dammit!

175
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,676
Cool it! That an adult
does what he wants.

176
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,711
Will they look for him?

177
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,272
I left my number.
They'll call if need be.

178
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,150
Great!

179
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,078
Stop worrying. It's no use.

180
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,154
No use!

181
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,633
You're all a pain!

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,989
Coming to dinner?

183
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,470
No.

184
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,514
What are you doing?

185
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,076
Nothing.

186
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,319
You won't have a bite?

187
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,748
I'm not hungry.

188
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,632
You ate nothing last night.

189
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,592
Mom, leave me alone.

190
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,833
September 2nd

191
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,434
2 days ago, I was in Tunisia.

192
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,914
- Fun?
- Fabulous.

193
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,835
Greg, you seen Leo?

194
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,597
He's changed schools.
Why? You care?

195
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,876
Coming in?

196
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,589
Wrong room.

197
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,791
- Which one do you need?
- Room 17.

198
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,390
It's in F building.

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,910
Thanks.

200
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,957
So, on your schedules,

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,196
in addition to the classes,

202
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,358
you need two internships in a firm.

203
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,874
Start canvassing firms now.

204
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,955
That search
is part of your training.

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,992
Subway stalled for 15 minutes.
Who knows why!

206
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,072
So, how was your first day?

207
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,793
He wasn't there.

208
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,269
Want some?

209
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,277
Maybe he's dead.

210
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,993
Don't talk nonsense.

211
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,679
Or he'd have called.

212
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,752
If he's had a problem, we'd know.

213
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,871
If he was alive, he'd call me.

214
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,514
He'd call me!

215
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,789
I didn't fight with him!

216
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,918
He hasn't answered
any of my messages!

217
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,076
Now his voicemail's full!

218
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,675
We can't just do nothing.

219
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,509
It's not possible! I can't take it!

220
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,994
Get it?

221
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,549
I can't!

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,596
Why are you staring at me?

223
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,799
Shit!

224
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,592
Here we're dealing with damages...

225
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,911
and if a mistake was committed,

226
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,153
or if there's a causal link

227
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,158
between the mistake

228
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,992
and the damages.

229
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,476
If both conditions are present,
civil liability

230
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,750
means the wrongdoer
has an obligation.

231
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,873
Miss Tellier!

232
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,392
Tell us about the 3 conditions
for civil liability?

233
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,915
Or what this class is about?

234
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,038
About civil liability.

235
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,070
Sorry?

236
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,313
Stand up, please.
Speak loud and clear.

237
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,593
We all want to hear your answer.

238
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,515
Move aside!

239
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,229
Miss!

240
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,953
Can you hear me?

241
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,712
Anyone got some sugar?
Get a glass of water!

242
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,352
Miss... wake up!

243
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,515
Miss!

244
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,312
- How long haven't you eaten?
- 8 or 9 days.

245
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,558
I asked her, Madame.

246
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,269
I don't know.

247
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,680
Your blood pressure's way too low.

248
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,272
If you don't eat,
you'll soon get sick.

249
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,154
You must eat,
not much but regularly.

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,434
Don't let your stomach grow idle.

251
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,752
- Understand?
- Yes.

252
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,836
Meanwhile, stay in bed.

253
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,953
Know what it's about?

254
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,718
About her brother.

255
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,231
He left home, hasn't called.

256
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,952
I'll prescribe her
a mild tranquilizer.

257
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,116
For you too, if you want.

258
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,389
Thanks, no.

259
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,950
- And you, Madame?
- I'm already on one.

260
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,197
Her first name's Elise, right?

261
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,436
If she won't eat,
I'll put her in hospital.

262
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,959
We can't take any risks.

263
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,788
- Are you OK, love?
- Are you hurt?

264
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,353
Slowly... careful.

265
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,469
Gently.

266
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,235
- Can you move?
- Yes.

267
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,673
Settle down and get undressed.

268
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,234
Need any help?

269
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,395
No, thanks.

270
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,948
What are you doing?

271
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,113
Answer, what are you doing?

272
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,074
Forget this. Until you eat,
you keep nothing, it's the rule.

273
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,554
No phone. Give it to me.

274
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,557
Give it to me! I expect a call!

275
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,796
No calls. First eat, then we'll see.

276
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,956
Move aside.

277
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,754
Move aside.

278
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,358
Move, or I'll get someone.

279
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,316
Get in pajamas, I'll be back.

280
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,469
Often the causes
aren't what we think.

281
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,673
But here we're sure.

282
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,118
He's her twin. They're very close.

283
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,550
We're only sure
she's deeply depressed.

284
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,318
We must find out why.

285
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,275
You said her brother.
He may have set it off,

286
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,550
but there must be a deeper reason.

287
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,633
We'll look for it.
And we'll find it.

288
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,640
You must know
that visits are forbidden.

289
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,195
Even for you.

290
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,116
What do you mean?

291
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,472
It's rough, but that's
part of the treatment.

292
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,999
Once she's eating
and gaining weight, you can see her.

293
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,712
Evening, girls.

294
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,318
Let's try and eat a little...

295
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,352
Chew well.

296
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,550
You OK?

297
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,878
Tomorrow we'll weigh you.

298
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,838
Come on, give it a try.

299
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,516
Please, can't I have my phone?

300
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,832
First you have to eat.

301
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,953
Please, just the phone.

302
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,873
No, you must eat.

303
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,551
Go on, I'm waiting.

304
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,518
There you go.

305
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,709
Keep at it.

306
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,629
Can I have it?

307
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,513
I can't, I told you.

308
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,554
Eat! I'll be back in 10 minutes.

309
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,878
Unless you eat,
your stomach will shrink.

310
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,713
You'll grow even thinner,
develop disorders, miss your period,

311
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,437
lose your memory,
your hair and teeth,

312
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,029
get irreversible cardiac disorders.

313
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,471
The heart's a muscle:
your muscles are melting.

314
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,517
You don't want to die?

315
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,553
Françoise!

316
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,314
Now what is it?

317
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,029
Can't we spend one night in peace?

318
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,273
Françoise!

319
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,871
Léa, it's Lili.
I'm locked up in Evry hospital.

320
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,749
Who is it?

321
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,477
What?

322
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,194
- Where?
- Evry hospital...

323
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,956
Lili?

324
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,072
What's going on?
What's wrong with her?

325
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,874
September 15

326
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,910
Hello, doctor.

327
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,438
Mr and Mrs Tellier,
you shouldn't come.

328
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,631
I said, you can't see her.
Just call.

329
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,956
We've called for 3 days,
and get no news!

330
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,197
Then there are none. You must wait.

331
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,110
We've isolated her

332
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,799
for her own good.

333
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,639
That won't help!

334
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,317
Sir, don't question
50 years of psychiatry.

335
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,192
We know what we're doing.

336
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,308
She's still fighting us,
but we'll work it out, trust us.

337
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,476
- She's fighting you?
- A bit. It'll be fine.

338
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,636
So she heals fast,
abide by the rules.

339
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,592
It's the only way.

340
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,155
Don't worry. OK?

341
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,439
I'll keep you posted.

342
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,273
Keep us posted, you bet!

343
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,469
Hi.

344
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,478
Right, hi.

345
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,071
We didn't know she was here.

346
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,672
- Well?
- No visits.

347
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,356
Why?

348
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,632
Now, to cure people,
they stick 'em in the hole!

349
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,559
- Stop it!
- Why? To hear that idiot

350
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,149
say he's locked her up
because he knows?

351
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,794
Screw his 50 years of psychiatry!

352
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,231
What does he know? Shit!

353
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,155
Excuse me.

354
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,593
It's 411.

355
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,149
Don't!

356
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,115
Who is it?

357
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,470
Us.

358
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,518
Thanks for coming.

359
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,834
If they catch you...

360
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,590
You OK?

361
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,110
And you?

362
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,599
Is your job nice?

363
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,314
My job? At the mart?

364
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,110
Yes... sure.

365
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,950
We woke you up. Sorry.

366
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,434
We won't stay long.

367
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,199
What can we do, Lili?

368
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,591
Dunno.

369
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,718
I brought you this.

370
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,228
It's called: "Off To See The Sea".

371
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,953
Nice idea, right?

372
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,438
Can't you get me out?

373
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,478
I'll die here.

374
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,789
You OK?

375
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,158
I must get my phone back.

376
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,516
From where?

377
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,635
The room by the nurses' room.

378
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,879
In case Loïc calls me... Please.

379
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,674
It's locked up. Look for the key.

380
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,029
Please.

381
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,033
What are you doing here?
Who are you?

382
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,033
Jean!

383
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,675
Jean!

384
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,229
What is it?

385
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,873
Over there.

386
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,236
Hurry!

387
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,433
Here, hold this.

388
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,909
Don't move!

389
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,872
I said, don't move!

390
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,237
What's all this? Who are you?

391
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,475
I want to leave.

392
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,193
Leave her alone! Look at her!

393
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,719
Give me that!

394
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,794
You won't get away with this!
Miss, go to your room!

395
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,119
Jean, take her back up!

396
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,311
- Don't you touch her!
- It's all over.

397
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,350
Let go of her.

398
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,352
Tolerating that soon leads to chaos.

399
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,630
It's a psychiatric ward,
with serious cases.

400
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,909
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,355
Sit down.

402
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,639
I'll be frank:
your daughter's health worries me.

403
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,830
She's in a precarious spiral.

404
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,235
She refuses to eat,
and to be drip fed.

405
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,431
She rips it off each time.

406
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,915
She says her brother has died,

407
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,236
and she wants to die, too.

408
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,630
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but it's a fact.

409
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,798
We had to strap her down.

410
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,916
What?

411
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,592
To keep the drip on.
Without glucose, she'll die.

412
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,639
We're going to force-feed her.

413
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,356
You're savages! That's torture!

414
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,834
- Paul!
- What, Paul?

415
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,749
Mr Tellier, your anger is justified.

416
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,916
That'll do, let us see her!

417
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,394
I can't.

418
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,429
It'll only drive her deeper
into her neurosis.

419
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,039
It could be fatal.

420
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,189
Stag-hunting to hounds is a rite.

421
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,753
Its call is "Tally Ho!"

422
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,437
Those words sum up
the pageant of the Hunt.

423
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,395
You're on horseback,
chasing your prey,

424
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,716
but the words "Tally Ho!"

425
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,636
summon the call
of the hunting horn...

426
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,829
You have an appointment?

427
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,634
No, but it's vital
to my daughter, Elise Tellier.

428
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,870
That's not possible.

429
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,231
- I want to see him now!
- You need an appointment.

430
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,038
She got a letter from her brother.
He wrote her.

431
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,797
Come in.

432
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,194
She must read it.

433
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,475
Come in, sit down.

434
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,878
We must snap her out of it.

435
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,079
That's impossible, you know that.

436
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,032
But it's from her brother!

437
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,037
After this, she'll eat again!

438
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,595
Things aren't that simple. Sit down.

439
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,198
Don't treat me like a moron!

440
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,595
I know what my daughter needs!

441
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,918
What does this letter say?

442
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,953
I didn't open it.
He wrote to her, not me!

443
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,636
If you won't give it to her, I will.

444
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,593
September 28th

445
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,988
Hi, darling.

446
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,390
You OK?

447
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,274
Don't you have TV?

448
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,028
No.

449
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,315
Here. Seems it's very good.

450
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,831
Thanks.

451
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,988
Where's your Diskman?

452
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,392
They still have it.
I'm only allowed books.

453
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,950
Then...

454
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,558
I'll bring you a book.

455
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,319
So you're eating now?

456
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,396
Yes.

457
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,830
Well?

458
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,116
He's in Rouen.

459
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,919
- I saw that.
- You saw it?

460
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,312
The postmark, on the envelope.

461
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,835
What does he say?

462
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,874
That he's fine.

463
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,638
That he flipped, lost his bearings,
had to clear out his head.

464
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,590
He's sorry he didn't contact me.

465
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,789
Is that all?

466
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,188
He gives you a big hug.

467
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,469
Lunch!

468
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,516
Sorry.

469
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,236
October 2nd

470
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,273
Leave it.

471
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,634
It's for you again.

472
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,074
Want some tea?

473
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,239
Yes, thanks.

474
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,515
Well?

475
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,320
"Lili, I just got to Rennes.
Nice town,

476
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,112
"think I'll stay here a bit,

477
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,711
"look for odd jobs, maybe
play guitar in a bar, who knows.

478
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,110
"It feels so good

479
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,359
"not seeing that creep,

480
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,350
"his wretched life and long face.

481
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,397
"Don't worry, I'm fine. Love you.

482
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,875
"Big hug, for Mom too. Loïc."

483
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,193
Milk or lemon?

484
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,876
Milk.

485
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,675
Mom, what happened between them?

486
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,396
Mom?

487
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,558
Just what he told you.

488
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,998
I don't get it either.

489
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,919
Shit!

490
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,510
Your mom
caught her foot in the wire.

491
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,552
She breaks everything now.

492
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,520
You go back to school Monday?

493
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,309
Dunno.

494
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,473
October 15th

495
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,439
Léa's not here.

496
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,437
I know, I need something.

497
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,755
That's not mine.

498
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,317
Sorry... I'm new here.

499
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,028
Mr Reynaud is wanted at checkout 3.

500
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,518
I need the key to cancel it.

501
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,318
I rang up an extra item.

502
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,798
Don't daydream!

503
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,752
This way, folks.

504
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,594
Concentrate, kid!
It's the rush hour.

505
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,994
27,50 please.

506
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,837
Thanks.

507
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,439
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

508
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,874
That all? You're a lousy customer.

509
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,514
Why? You get a cut?
Shall I buy more?

510
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,154
No need.

511
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,598
You're through at 7PM?

512
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,552
Yeah, when we've swept up.

513
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,871
A Perrier, please!

514
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,030
Léa's seeing her teacher tonight?

515
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,355
Yes.

516
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,950
Any news from your brother?

517
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,872
I got a card yesterday.
From Le Mans.

518
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,674
He moves around.

519
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,316
Yeah. Dunno what he's doing.

520
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,989
Doesn't he say?

521
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,950
Says he gets odd jobs,
sometimes he plays in bars.

522
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,796
He plays guitar
and sings really well.

523
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,599
He stays a few days,

524
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,592
sometimes a week.

525
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,677
From Rennes, he wrote me twice.

526
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,075
Then he's up and gone.

527
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,798
He doesn't want to see me.

528
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,510
Near my grandparents' home,
a young guy just split one day,

529
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,558
no one ever knew why.

530
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,594
Gave no news for years.
Not a letter.

531
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,037
Then one day, his parents
were 200 miles from home,

532
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,551
and saw him, lying on the sidewalk,

533
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,472
begging with a dog.

534
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,033
Why tell me that?

535
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,669
Dunno.

536
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,515
To show one can't
get inside people's heads.

537
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,552
Maybe he met someone and...

538
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,955
You should put an ad in the paper.

539
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,390
Ask for his phone number or address.

540
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,158
He doesn't want to see me.

541
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,389
I wanted to say...

542
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,477
When you came to the hospital...

543
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,988
That was great.

544
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,754
So was the book.

545
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,956
It's good, huh?

546
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,476
Ends badly, but it was good.

547
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,871
Ends well in a way,
badly in another, that's life.

548
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,714
It's that one.

549
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,431
With the blue door?

550
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,551
It's the Truman Show here.

551
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,793
Loïc says
it's like an Indian reservation.

552
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,231
And it's miles from anywhere.

553
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,310
You can't slog this every day.

554
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,559
Found a rental?

555
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,110
No. They're too pricey,
or already taken.

556
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,239
Our janitor's moving out soon.
Shall I ask?

557
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,869
Depends on the price.

558
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,395
It's the size of this car,
can't cost much.

559
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,159
Sure, yes.

560
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,079
Well... See you soon.

561
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,912
Can you find your way back?

562
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,395
Sure. Or I'll ask an Indian.

563
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,909
You OK?

564
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,715
Why did you come?

565
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,830
To say hi.

566
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,439
I'm going out.

567
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,355
They here?

568
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,039
Where else would they be?

569
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,277
I gotta go, I'm late.

570
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,755
Bye.

571
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,712
In the market,
I saw your old English teacher.

572
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,391
She said don't quit school,
go back next year.

573
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,188
I won't, I told you.

574
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,799
Be a cashier for life?

575
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,349
I'll find something.

576
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,839
With a high school diploma?

577
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,314
You had even less.

578
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,755
I had no choice.
And I went to night school.

579
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,636
Wish I could've gone to college!

580
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,678
Kids without a degree

581
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,236
aren't hired as filing clerks.

582
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,836
They'll be bums, pushers or whores.

583
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,399
So I'll end up a whore.

584
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,673
Well, what does Loïc say?

585
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,269
He's fine, in Angers.
It's not great, so he'll move on.

586
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,036
"But I'm free of that creep

587
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,198
"who says "Shush"
or "Tidy your room"!

588
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,155
"Now I'm rid of him, I feel alive.

589
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,478
"Hope you're well, kiss Mom.

590
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,432
"I love you. Big hug, Loïc."

591
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,438
I may have found a pad.

592
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,359
I'm splitting, too.

593
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,958
December 31

594
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,750
You look lost. Don't know anyone?

595
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,712
I'm with Léa and Thomas...

596
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,679
Léa, that black girl.

597
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,629
Lucille's friend. She's nice.

598
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,269
- Where did you meet her?
- We work together.

599
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,435
You in grad school?

600
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,358
No, in the local supermarket.

601
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,315
What else do you do?

602
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,353
Nothing. I'm a cashier.

603
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,070
What else?

604
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,508
I'm just a cashier.

605
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,949
Really?

606
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,639
Yes, really.

607
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,629
I'll grab a drink. Want one?

608
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,353
No, thanks.

609
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,074
Hi, what'll it be?

610
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,916
Some of that.

611
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,156
Thanks.

612
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,119
Not too bored?

613
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,232
I'm fine. I drink to forget.

614
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,235
You must eat, too.

615
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,953
There's fabulous salmon.

616
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,991
Don't stuff me like a Jewish mom!

617
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,916
Lili!

618
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,270
- Come meet someone.
- No, I'm fine.

619
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,751
Thomas!

620
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,199
Come over here.

621
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,993
You go. I'll have a smoke.

622
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,673
You came with Léa, right?

623
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,315
I tried out
for grad school with her.

624
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,873
But I didn't get in.

625
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,396
What do you do?

626
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,877
Senior in Business School.

627
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,235
And you?

628
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,672
Junior supermarket cashier.

629
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,554
What's that?

630
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,229
You memorize bar codes,
then they test you on prices.

631
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,398
That's for theory.
The practical test is

632
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,679
ringing up scads of items
in under 3 minutes,

633
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,119
and making change fast.

634
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,754
Sounds tough!

635
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,551
5... 4...

636
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,397
3...

637
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,397
2... 1...

638
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,233
Happy New Year!

639
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,794
Happy New Year!

640
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,113
Happy New Year!

641
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,513
Mind if I go home?

642
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,155
You sure?

643
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,068
You're right.

644
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,954
He's a bum now, ashamed to see me.

645
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,909
Love, health and money!

646
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,550
Chateau Beychevelle 1995.

647
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,348
Holy dust!

648
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,392
You should've let it breathe.

649
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,828
I forgot.

650
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,434
Well?

651
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,673
Yes, it's fine.

652
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:46,594
For a while it was a weird color.

653
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,193
Needs salt.

654
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,516
- Wait, I'll get it!
- No, eat!

655
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,113
On New Year's Day she tries
exotic menus. Foul, isn't it?

656
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,116
Not great.

657
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,436
She's made tons,
I'll eat it all week.

658
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,835
It's a new Alsatian recipe.

659
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,553
- Not having any?
- Sure.

660
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,279
How was the party last night?

661
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,869
- Fine. What did you do?
- Nothing.

662
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,833
You didn't see the Leducs?

663
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,359
Not this year.

664
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,152
He mailed it 2 days ago.

665
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,837
Says he just got there.

666
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,108
He must still be there.
I'll head there.

667
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,996
Reims is a city.
You won't find him.

668
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,389
Tomorrow's Sunday. It'll be dead.

669
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,158
I'll check out the hotels.

670
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,231
Downtown
there's 4 in his price range.

671
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,908
Really? What's his price range?

672
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,714
Got a better idea?

673
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,753
Beats sitting around on your ass.

674
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,669
Come with me?

675
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,552
Two of us will do better.

676
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,554
He trashes me,
he won't want to see me.

677
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,117
What does he say in that one?

678
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,475
Tell me.

679
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,239
- Stop it, Dad.
- Paul!

680
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,357
If it's about me, I can read it.

681
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,350
"Lili, I'm in Reims. It's a dump.

682
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,389
"Glad I got my guitar. My dumb dad
never listened to me sing!

683
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,034
"Feels good to be rid of his face

684
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,673
"and his wretched life.

685
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,274
"Happy New Year, Sis.
I think of you.

686
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,675
"Kiss Mom. Loïc."

687
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,559
He doesn't mean that...

688
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,554
Stop, Mom.

689
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,589
His wretched life. Wretched, how?

690
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,949
I enjoyed breaking
my butt for 25 years?

691
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,196
Who paid for this place,

692
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,517
his moped, guitar lessons,
rock-climbing course?

693
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,835
Stop it, Paul!

694
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,239
I know all that, Dad.

695
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,829
Bye.

696
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,916
True, I didn't relate to him. Right?

697
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,356
Dunno.

698
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,235
I do.

699
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,875
And I never listened to his songs.

700
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,594
I did nothing with him. Nothing.

701
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,513
Never kicked a soccer ball.

702
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,191
I've got a CD he made.

703
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,955
I can leave it for you.

704
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,674
I'd like that.

705
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,598
You'll see, it's great.

706
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,394
If I see him,
I'll say you listened to it.

707
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,518
He'll like that.

708
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,390
Hi.

709
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,074
I'm looking for someone.

710
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,795
Around 20. His name's Loïc.

711
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,560
Loïc Tellier. He too plays guitar.

712
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,239
Is he homeless?

713
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,995
I don't know.

714
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,556
What was that dude's name?

715
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,352
Wasn't Loïc, I reckon...

716
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,118
Forget it. Sorry. Thanks.

717
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,799
Where's the downtown area?

718
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,638
This is it.

719
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,750
Thanks.

720
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,511
Downtown! She's nuts!

721
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,631
No one by that name...

722
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,518
Try the St. André, on the right.

723
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,391
Thanks.

724
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,676
Hi.

725
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,470
I'm looking for someone.
The Hotel Monopole said...

726
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,911
What's the name?

727
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,314
Loïc Tellier.

728
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,192
Yes, Tellier slept here.

729
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,396
Is he here?

730
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,598
No, he paid and left.

731
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,830
When?

732
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,794
Last night and he left.
I got here at 8AM...

733
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,718
Say, 8.45AM.

734
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,756
That all?

735
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,310
Yes...

736
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,395
No. Sorry.

737
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,597
Did he look OK?
Were his clothes clean?

738
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,834
Seemed OK.
I don't sniff the customers.

739
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,318
He had his guitar?
In a blue canvas case?

740
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,717
Yes, a blue canvas case.

741
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,989
That it?

742
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,396
Thanks. Bye.

743
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,390
It's over.

744
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,591
What?

745
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,074
Thomas and me.

746
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,872
I'm leaving him.

747
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,675
I don't like
what's happening to us.

748
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,475
If we keep it up,
it'll end badly.

749
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,918
We never got beyond
what we always were.

750
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,354
2 shacked-up friends.

751
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,470
You won't meet?

752
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,954
Sure, as friends.

753
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:39,831
Hi, girls.

754
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,596
I'm renting a place with my sister.

755
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,876
Don't look so glum,
it's no big deal.

756
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:48,751
I hope so.

757
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,196
So!

758
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,638
A small birthday gift.

759
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,915
From me.

760
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,269
That's from me, from us.

761
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,799
That's for you.

762
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,594
It's not my birthday!

763
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,074
Don't fight it.

764
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,076
By the author of
"Off To See The Sea".

765
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,078
It's great. And this one ends well.

766
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,032
Don't tell her the ending.

767
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,431
I ran out of gift paper.

768
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,715
You're crazy!

769
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,110
It's fabulous,
but they cost a fortune!

770
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,548
We bought it together.

771
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,836
Thanks.

772
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,393
How can I thank you!

773
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,314
Happy Birthday!

774
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,433
What's this?

775
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,676
You swipe mine
so I figured you'd need one.

776
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,431
- Can I still?
- You bet!

777
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,755
I got this, too.

778
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,075
It's lovely.

779
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,632
From Loïc. His gift.
Sent to my parents' place.

780
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,988
Look, it's him.

781
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,479
You're so alike.

782
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,035
Aren't they?

783
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,915
Shall we eat?

784
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,754
First, we drink.

785
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,795
To you!

786
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,193
To your birthday. You're 20!

787
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,519
To you two.

788
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,596
To you.

789
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,994
To all three of us.

790
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,474
To him, too.

791
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,874
To Loïc.

792
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,077
...and her girlfriend says:
"They're not mouses, they're mice."

793
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,033
And the blonde says:
"They look so alike!"

794
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,790
At the office,
we get that crap all day.

795
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,194
I bet you do.

796
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,074
My dad taught me that.

797
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,554
At first, it's surprising.

798
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,636
Bye, hon.

799
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,636
Where you going?

800
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,308
To my sister's.
I got an 8AM class.

801
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,948
Bye, handsome.

802
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,679
Well, well!

803
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,071
That's how she is.
Makes up her mind fast.

804
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,272
Wasn't it a bit sudden?

805
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,388
Your split up.

806
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,476
Things had been tough for a while.

807
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,434
I didn't know.

808
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,671
It was my fault, not hers.

809
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,752
A fixation I couldn't get rid of.

810
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,633
Thanks, I'm not thirsty.

811
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,469
I know...

812
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,992
I need sleep.
Storm clouds are brewing.

813
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,715
Depression's in the air.

814
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,272
The atmospheric kind!

815
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,150
Good night.

816
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,273
July 10th

817
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,510
There...

818
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,759
Léa's leaving us, and in the fall
she's going to...

819
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,552
- Where?
- Mozambique.

820
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,638
I didn't know it existed!

821
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,996
To her! To you, kiddo!

822
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,156
To Mozambique! And to vacations!

823
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,316
Right to vacations!

824
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,636
The vac is being rid of him!

825
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,398
What'll you do there?

826
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,510
Finish my thesis.

827
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:02,596
How'll you survive?

828
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,631
Work and my scholarship.

829
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,717
You're paid to go there?

830
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,195
They'd have to pay me, too!

831
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,279
Where are you vacationing?

832
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,629
In the Creuse.

833
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,796
It's more exotic among the Zulus,

834
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,274
but count me out.

835
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,310
When are you leaving?

836
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,273
Saturday. You said
I couldn't leave tonight!

837
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,233
True, I'd only have
2 cashiers for 4 days.

838
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,158
Where in the Creuse?
I'm from there.

839
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,873
- Where's that again?
- Crozant.

840
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:27,990
Yes, Crozant's nice.

841
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,634
I'm joining her
in a house by a river.

842
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,400
I'll be going
with my new boyfriend!

843
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,431
Couldn't you fit me in?

844
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,352
Not a chance.

845
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,557
Why?

846
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,673
I'll be with my Zulu pals.
And we eat fat whiteys!

847
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,159
I'm not the janitor!

848
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,475
It's me!

849
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,430
Come in!

850
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,358
Not working?

851
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,956
I took 2 hours off.

852
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,951
- Packed your bag?
- Yes.

853
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,677
I rented a car,
and got the same one as you!

854
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,154
Going to the Creuse in a Smart?

855
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,034
It was the cheapest.

856
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,790
You won't come to Brittany with me?

857
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,753
No. Tonight, I'll sleep at my folks.

858
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,269
Tomorrow I go to Crozant,
to join Léa.

859
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,958
I'll quit thinking.
Just swim, sleep and eat.

860
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,752
Not thinking. That's your vac?

861
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,036
Yes.

862
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,152
You won't try something else?

863
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,150
Thomas, I adore you.

864
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,954
And I mean that.

865
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,998
But I want no part of all that.

866
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,428
I'll sleep for 2 weeks,
which suits me fine.

867
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,272
That's crap, Lili.

868
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,876
He won't come back, you know that.

869
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,832
No, I don't! Shut up!

870
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,634
He's moved on. It's been a year!

871
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,393
And would he like
what you've become?

872
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,390
How can you live this way?

873
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,113
The austere Queen of the Mart,
who never goes out?

874
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,548
What do you want?

875
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,997
Want us to make love, that it?

876
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:43,596
OK, go ahead.

877
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,597
Now. Let's get it over with.

878
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,469
Stop it!

879
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,156
I can't give you anything more.

880
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,389
Truly.

881
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,668
You'd have enjoyed seeing the sea.

882
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,912
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, darling.

883
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,949
So you're on vacation?

884
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,479
I made lamb kebab.

885
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,679
We're coming. Come look...

886
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,590
Don't read it in front of him,
it upsets him.

887
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,519
You know, St. Aubin-On-Sea?

888
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,472
- In Normandy?
- Yeah.

889
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,830
What does he say?

890
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,988
He's on vacation, swimming.
He kisses us both.

891
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,038
And about your dad?

892
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,434
Same things.

893
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,354
Go on, read it.

894
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,629
Come and get it!

895
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,958
Main course coming up!

896
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,479
Almost done.

897
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,195
Smells good.

898
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,234
Caraway seed! With a good sauce,
you're a broiler champ.

899
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,270
Help yourself.

900
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,439
The lamb must stay pink.
Overcooked, it's wrecked.

901
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,914
Where you going in the Creuse?

902
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,109
Crozant.

903
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,436
Driving in that buggy?

904
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,359
It's a lovely spot.

905
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,511
No noisy neighbors.
Even in August, it's dead.

906
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,231
My office pals
are headed to Brittany.

907
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,391
It's the in-place now.

908
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,832
Nice spot, huh?

909
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,954
Alain and Myriam
bought a house in St. Malo.

910
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,592
Remember,
the little igloo tent we bought?

911
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,153
Know where it is?

912
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,473
In the garage.

913
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,033
You're not in a house?

914
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,471
There's a gang of us.
Might be too few beds.

915
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,394
You said overcooking wrecks it?

916
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:26,790
It's OK!

917
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,357
They're a bit charred, but OK!

918
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,231
About St. Malo...

919
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,558
that place gets to me!

920
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,476
I love it. I could end up there.

921
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,992
Guess they're charred.

922
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,152
We agreed to stay put, this year.

923
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,554
Not for a vacation.

924
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:48,990
To live there.

925
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,310
In St. Malo?

926
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,518
Now the kids are gone.

927
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,032
You could come visit us.

928
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,351
It's only 3 hours by train,
there's the sea...

929
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,118
What'd we do? And your job?

930
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,554
We'd open a pancake joint.

931
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,158
All St. Malo needs
is another pancake joint!

932
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,234
Something else, a steak house...

933
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,069
You want to leave your job,
Paris, the house?

934
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,109
We'll sell it.
But it has to suit you.

935
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,756
On the Net, I saw a lovely house,
big garden, flowers,

936
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,399
by the sea...

937
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:30,113
Ground floor's a pancake joint,
but we can change that.

938
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,920
Chef, they're blazing again!

939
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,876
So you came to see the sea?

940
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,193
What are you doing here?

941
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,833
How did you find me?

942
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,312
In the Creuse,
they said you were here.

943
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,673
You went there, then came here?

944
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,354
In a Smart?

945
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,754
Here, put this on...

946
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,750
Can we have some bread and butter?

947
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,756
How many slices?

948
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,995
Four!

949
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,599
And 6 croissants!

950
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,239
For once, you're eating.

951
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,195
What is it?

952
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,949
I'll be back.

953
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,515
Was that him?

954
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,999
You spoke to him?

955
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,713
Bastard never wrote me. Never!

956
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,039
It wasn't him,

957
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,559
it wasn't him...

958
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,513
We start with the fireworks display
Parisians saw last night.

959
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,396
Now you'll get to see it, too...

960
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,394
Who is it?

961
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,430
Me.

962
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,551
You were due back Saturday.

963
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,591
Got fed up. Came back last night.

964
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,395
You eaten?

965
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,676
Want a dessert?

966
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,308
No, thanks.

967
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,519
Was the Creuse nice?

968
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:40,990
Yes.

969
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,190
In 3 days you've seen it all.

970
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,195
You have a letter.

971
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,835
I saw it.

972
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,155
Not opening it?

973
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,669
Sure...

974
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,473
Want some ice-cream?

975
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,476
No, thanks.

976
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,790
- You're not chatty.
- She's just back. Don't bug her.

977
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,310
- Want some ice-cream?
- Thanks, no.

978
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,555
What does he say?

979
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,917
He's still in St Aubin,
he won't stay,

980
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,672
he's going overseas,
as far as he can.

981
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,759
"So I never see
that asshole again...

982
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,119
"in his suit and tie...

983
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,950
"his commuter train and TV set.

984
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,950
"Sis, don't let him talk you
into that life.

985
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,154
"Try to do something great.

986
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,758
"Dream on!"

987
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:04,993
Want to rest upstairs?

988
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,876
No.

989
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,315
I need some air.

990
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,473
How about a bike ride?

991
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:14,789
Now?

992
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:15,955
Yes.

993
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,197
You mom and I talked it over...

994
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,837
She's warming up to St. Malo.

995
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,793
What do you think?

996
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,313
This house
with the kids' rooms empty,

997
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:40,748
I can't take it.

998
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,956
I saw you in St. Aubin, Dad.

999
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,796
I saw you mail the letter.

1000
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,275
You told your mom?

1001
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,554
Tell her.

1002
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,198
Now you know, tell her.

1003
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:41,599
I'll put yours away.

1004
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,795
So who won the Tour de France?

1005
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:57,956
Dunno.

1006
01:16:58,160 --> 01:16:59,115
Sorry.

1007
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,391
I guess you discussed St. Malo.

1008
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,556
Yeah.

1009
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,796
And?

1010
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,429
What do you think?

1011
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,838
I can't make up my mind.

1012
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,752
He seems to want it so badly.

1013
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,436
What is it?

1014
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,599
Loïc didn't write
those letters, Mom.

1015
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,750
What?

1016
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,519
He never wrote.

1017
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:21,835
It was Dad.

1018
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,955
Imitated his handwriting,
and mailed them.

1019
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,388
What's all this?

1020
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,033
I didn't go to Crozant.

1021
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,272
I saw him in St. Aubin.

1022
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,273
He mailed the letters.

1023
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,548
All of them.

1024
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,435
From the start.

1025
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,958
Don't be mad at him.

1026
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,316
Without those letters, I'd be dead.

1027
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,108
He saved me.

1028
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,518
I wanted to say...

1029
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,434
I've met someone.

1030
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,359
You must meet him.

1031
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,710
Sure.

1032
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,996
You can both come on Sunday.

1033
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,635
No, Sunday's Dad's birthday.

1034
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,799
So what? On the contrary.
Come Sunday, it's fine.

1035
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,634
July 20th

1036
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,829
You, here?

1037
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,155
Passing by.

1038
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,237
On Sunday morning?
You could've called.

1039
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,236
Who is it?

1040
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,316
Thomas.

1041
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,078
You remembered we exist?

1042
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,199
Work going OK?

1043
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,159
I see the weather report,
so I'm with you.

1044
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,117
We're lunching at your aunt's.
Want to come?

1045
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,629
- I can't.
- You got better things to do.

1046
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,594
We'll be at grandma's first.
Can't you stop by?

1047
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,631
- Where's Mathieu?
- With a pal.

1048
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,671
Sure, pals come first!

1049
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,631
What's she like? Is she cute?

1050
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,110
Yes.

1051
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,518
Grandma would've liked her.

1052
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:50,196
At least she lunches
with her folks on Sunday!

1053
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,716
You coming?

1054
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,029
You coming?

1055
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,756
Hi.

1056
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,157
You came to see Lili?

1057
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,798
You're her friend!
She didn't tell us.

1058
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,317
- That it was you.
- It's me, yes.

1059
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,389
Come in.

1060
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,272
She's not here yet,
won't be long.

1061
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,348
Hope so,
or the roast'll be overdone.

1062
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,036
Paul, it's Elise's friend.

1063
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,709
Hi.

1064
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,592
- Thomas.
- Right... Paul.

1065
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,274
Let's have a drink.

1066
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,109
Sit down.

1067
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,031
Like what? Whisky? Port wine?

1068
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,999
Port wine's fine.

1069
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,190
What about your girlfriend?

1070
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,716
Léa?

1071
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:39,115
We're not together anymore.

1072
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,233
That's weird.

1073
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,192
You're still Lili's neighbor?

1074
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:50,789
Yes.

1075
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,510
But I'm from nearby Draveil.

1076
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,837
I went to high school in Montgeron,

1077
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:58,711
like her.

1078
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,989
Really?

1079
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:05,036
Funny. You grew up side by side,
without knowing it.

1080
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,275
Yes.

1081
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,799
My parents still live there.

1082
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,235
I visited them before coming here.

1083
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,750
We went to the cemetery,
to see my grandma's grave...

1084
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,192
Draveil cemetery.

1085
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,468
You know it?

1086
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,519
What happened?

1087
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,148
Rock-climbing.

1088
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,876
During his rock-climbing course.

1089
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,074
He fell.

1090
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,914
While Lili was in Spain.

1091
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:03,989
A year ago.

1092
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,751
You won't tell her.

1093
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,394
Right?

1094
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,989
You're crazy.

1095
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,988
Please don't.

1096
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,356
There.

1097
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,638
No need for introductions.

1098
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,668
Hi, darling.

1099
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,116
I'm coming.

1100
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,510
You OK?

1101
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,839
- Want a drink?
- No.

1102
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,157
Some port, so we can toast.

1103
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,675
To your birthday!

1104
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,430
Cheers.

1105
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,479
What's she doing?

1106
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,557
Mom! Come raise your glass?

1107
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,270
What is it?

1108
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,594
The roast burned.

1109
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,873
Doesn't matter.
Why are you so upset?

1110
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,395
Doesn't matter,

1111
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,113
we'll cook something else.

1112
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,431
We'll make pasta.

1113
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,439
Pasta's nice.

1114
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,117
He doesn't mind.

1115
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,549
Sure...

1116
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,274
What if we ate out?

1117
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,072
No, we'll eat here.

1118
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,032
Let me take you to lunch.

1119
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,674
Nearby, at "Jean's Place".

1120
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,433
We can walk there.

1121
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:05,756
Let us take you.

1122
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,235
- I said I wanted to.
- He's right.

1123
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,638
We'll be fine there.

1124
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,598
I have something to tell you.

1125
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,994
Me, too.

1126
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,189
I love you.

1127
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,995
Me, too.

1128
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,798
Shall we go off somewhere?

1129
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:46,796
Yes.

1130
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,999
Where to?

1131
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,792
Dunno, wherever you want.

1132
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,310
Want to go back to see the sea?

1133
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,910
Yes.
