1
00:01:13,186 --> 00:01:17,714
Next stop is Luxemburg.

2
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:23,259
Passengers arrive at Luxemburg please go to the exit.

3
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:49,812
Oh, good job!

4
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:56,490
Yellow is just so so, but red...

5
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,925
Hello, guy, paint with more red color...

6
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:01,052
so that this picture can be more attractive.

7
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:04,556
What the hell are you guy doing here?

8
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:06,666
What do you know about it? Do you understand it?

9
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,868
You are always drawing pictures which nobody wants to buy.

10
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,102
What do you mean? These drawings are priceless?

11
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,238
Yes, that's what I just meant! Anything wrong?

12
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:12,398
The guy who stole the passenger's wallet.

13
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:15,342
What can you call them besides cheater? Ok...

14
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:17,377
Do not lose face here, let's go home!

15
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:19,646
You fucking guy, damn it!

16
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:21,773
Oh! You guy

17
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,547
What do you want? Come on! Head's up!

18
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:35,061
Fuck you, I don't mean to beat you.

19
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:36,858
But now it's you who threatened me to do.

20
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:39,764
Are you ok? What's wrong with you?

21
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,303
Why did you do that?

22
00:03:43,303 --> 00:03:44,827
Don't you think what he said was too tough?

23
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:48,475
Go away, he was just in the point! Go out!

24
00:03:48,475 --> 00:03:52,036
Please don't come over again! Never come back!

25
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:57,378
Fucking guy!

26
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,684
Excuse me, passport please.

27
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:16,414
Thank you.

28
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:29,769
It's you, isn't it?

29
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,203
Yes, remember to come again.

30
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:36,840
Thank you, passport please.

31
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:45,316
What are you for in France?

32
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,419
He comes along with me.

33
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:56,585
Sorry, goodbye.

34
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:32,389
Hey! You fucking guy steals again!

35
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,364
You are a thief.

36
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:41,608
That's why I don't want you to come with me.

37
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:44,811
Wake up, boy! You suck.

38
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,746
Do you dare steal again?!

39
00:07:58,224 --> 00:08:00,920
Hello, are you hot, cute girl?

40
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,893
No! Don't do that.

41
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:33,021
Thank you, what's your name?

42
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,296
My name is Qinghai, and you?

43
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:37,096
Colin.

44
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:37,730
Colin?

45
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,698
Qinghai, thank you again for what you did moment ago.

46
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:43,429
Do you like that sculpture?

47
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,773
No, I just enjoy her expressions.

48
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:48,502
I want her head.

49
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:52,679
That's the national treasure!
You will be put to jail if you steal that.

50
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,307
Anyhow I really want that.

51
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:23,242
Come on! The guard is drawing near.
Come on!

52
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:11,766
You are Korean? Is that right? Haha! Put the coin here.

53
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:22,488
Like this...Oh, by the way it's not mine.

54
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:27,357
Open it in the same way for the next time.

55
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:36,069
It's called Bigo, Bigo, understand?

56
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,106
You don't have to pay. It's pleasure to help the Korean.

57
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:42,336
Remember it's called Bigo. You may have a try yourself.

58
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:16,876
Come on, the performance here is wonderful.

59
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,470
Open your eyes wide! Come on!

60
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:26,911
I will drop in whenever I have time.

61
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,216
I love you.

62
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:09,529
But don't ask me to do the same thing again.

63
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:10,791
It should be the last one.

64
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,031
I see.

65
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:55,904
Stand still.

66
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:38,809
And stop fighting.

67
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:43,289
Shit.

68
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,483
Where did that guy come from?

69
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,645
Great! Excellent job.

70
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,383
Let's introduce ourselves formally. My name is Qinghai.

71
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:19,592
You are a fucking thief.

72
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:22,962
Go away. I just want to return your stuff.

73
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,197
That's why I went there.

74
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,634
Coincidentally I met them and the money.

75
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:31,537
I didn't want to lose the money so I put it in my pocket.

76
00:16:31,537 --> 00:16:32,799
I didn't use even a penny.

77
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:35,899
Fucking guy.

78
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,169
Count the money yourself.

79
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:44,313
Hey! Are you a spy?

80
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,246
What did you say?

81
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,554
Maybe the spy can't be so poor.

82
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,658
Have you made any artificial medicine?

83
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,226
and sold them here, is that right?

84
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:57,763
Shut up, fucking guy! Or I would kill you.

85
00:16:57,763 --> 00:16:59,754
No, don't describe it so terrible.

86
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,392
Then why did you come to Paris?

87
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:05,071
Why did you come here?

88
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:08,007
You can have a comfortable life in Korea with such amount of money.

89
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:11,272
Do you know why I didn¡¯t use any of the money?

90
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:14,947
Oh, fucking guy! With the people like you,

91
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:17,643
the South and the North Korea can never be unified.

92
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,327
Fuck you!

93
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:50,613
Open the door quickly.

94
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:56,018
He was making trouble here and there, and beaten me.

95
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:58,190
Shit!

96
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,556
I'm innocent, I didn't do anything wrong!

97
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,991
Fuck you, what the hell are you doing here?

98
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:11,292
That guy seemed to have some word to say.

99
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,866
It was my fault to beat you, open the door please.

100
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:23,540
He said he would kill me after I was released here.

101
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,494
What do you plan to do? Do business with me?

102
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:36,927
Or stayed in the prison for the whole life?

103
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:38,355
Do you really want to die?

104
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,662
Beat me, kill me!

105
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,440
Can we really stay in Paris?

106
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,074
Of course, trust me.

107
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:57,216
How can you such a foreigner...

108
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:58,384
put up here!

109
00:18:58,384 --> 00:18:59,874
This is my last choice.

110
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,288
Ok! Although I don't want to wallow in the mire with you,

111
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,293
I trust in you this time.

112
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:49,196
Great, this is what we have got. Wait a moment!

113
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:54,598
300 Francs is too much, just give you 50 Francs.

114
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:57,837
Hey! Is that right to follow my orders?

115
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:03,643
It's piece of cake for me to cleave the brick in two.

116
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:06,841
This can be the art! Not only singing,

117
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,944
but dancing, drawing as well can be described as a kind of art.

118
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:19,765
When we eat,

119
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:21,062
don't make any noise.

120
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,537
Follow me, hold the glass gentlely.

121
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,402
Then close your eyes like this.

122
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:31,475
You should learn to be Paris' citizen.

123
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:33,612
Hey, guy, I wanna ask you

124
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:34,980
whether you are good at fighting.

125
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,811
At teenager, that's the only thing I have learnt.

126
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,748
There's no place in my country to earn money.

127
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,315
Come to see my performance tomorrow.

128
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:52,793
Shit, must I?

129
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,632
Don't be afraid, I am ready for that.

130
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:19,121
Let him do that.

131
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:46,751
What quick movement! Think it over to work for me!

132
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:50,351
Work for you?

133
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:54,526
Don't you say that you come here to earn money?!

134
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,261
It's a loss for such talented people to be a street-performer.

135
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,997
Now you have got a good chance,

136
00:21:57,997 --> 00:21:59,898
to show your talent, is that right?

137
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:01,400
It's the chance granted by God.

138
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,731
They come here to employ you

139
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,295
but I still don't want to accept.

140
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:06,972
This is a golden chance for us to cooperate,

141
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:09,634
to earn huge quantity of money in the future.

142
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,571
We won't do that. Cleaving the brick in the square can also earn money.

143
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,917
You can earn lots of money just for cleaving once or twice.

144
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,154
Then we can buy house and car.

145
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:24,952
and other goods. Take my advice.

146
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:30,494
I come here not for fighting.

147
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:34,459
Ok, then we can do it just once.

148
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,368
I take full responsibility.

149
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:38,470
A car in the square was pressed flat,

150
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,405
but no one was injured. Let's do it only once!

151
00:22:54,453 --> 00:23:01,427
Come on, he's coming! Go out quickly!

152
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:04,555
Fucking guy, do it quickly!

153
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,132
Hi, let's have a chat.

154
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:27,720
How are you? Are you ok?

155
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,521
Wipe the blood away.

156
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:37,451
It doesn't matter...give me handkerchief, it hurts...

157
00:23:56,381 --> 00:24:03,055
Hongshan, Hongshan, you have so much money.

158
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:08,459
Let's divide it into two, one million for both, let's go!

159
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:13,465
Let's go home.

160
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,955
I should compensate for you.

161
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,536
It's ok. Please don't leave me alone.

162
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:20,038
Ok, this is our room, come in please.

163
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,341
It's a skilled chick. I have paid the money.

164
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:25,043
Use your man's vigor.

165
00:24:25,043 --> 00:24:29,241
For only 500 Francs!

166
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,068
What the hell are you doing here?

167
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:38,382
Is this kind of making love? You looked like a bull.

168
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:40,542
Fuck your asshole.

169
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:19,955
Who's that?

170
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:40,536
Hey, wait! Have you fucked Colin?

171
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:50,923
When I wasn't here, have you made love with him?

172
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:53,357
Go away!

173
00:27:32,764 --> 00:27:36,165
You will be arrested while you don't have any card.

174
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:38,837
I was the only man who can give you living.

175
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:41,704
But for me you are already prostitute.

176
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:44,098
You can never be out of my control.

177
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:06,665
Boss, there are show of many beautiful girls.

178
00:28:06,665 --> 00:28:09,600
Come in please, and enjoy yourself.

179
00:28:11,103 --> 00:28:11,831
That's fine.

180
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:15,707
You can get...

181
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:19,277
whatever you want here.

182
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:23,873
It's over there, come with me.

183
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,776
Excuse me.

184
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:31,316
Come over here, there's nobody here.

185
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:19,555
Fucking guy.

186
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:37,311
You shall pay for having sex with other one's woman.

187
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,375
What's more, I have enough money.

188
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:44,755
If you dare to approach Colin again,

189
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:49,685
I will kill you and take your heart out.

190
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:26,193
Ok, Emie.

191
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:44,341
Honey ,kiss me.

192
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:10,366
Rola,Rola

193
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:16,413
Rola, give me some money.

194
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:23,488
The man who abandon his child...

195
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:24,723
can be said as a qualified father?

196
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:26,191
When you leave a 14-year old girl...

197
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:27,292
in the streets,

198
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:28,759
have you regard her your daughter?

199
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:04,095
Rola, Rola, Rola

200
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:06,188
You should do me another favor.

201
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:11,903
What? I said that was the last time.

202
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:14,463
Please, this time is the last one.

203
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:18,433
No! Please don't do that business any more.

204
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,479
Rola, I love you! Just once.

205
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:22,605
I will never do that business again.

206
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,909
If I did, I would feel anxious

207
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:34,247
Sure the last time?

208
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,068
Is that a Korean?

209
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,834
Where are the Korean? They are all mixed blood.

210
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:07,451
Please help me! I give you the money and you help me.

211
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:13,226
This...is for you, help me please.

212
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:21,072
I won't do that! Won't!

213
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,240
You beat your countrymen just for money.

214
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,311
Do you feel sad about that?

215
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:27,645
I'm not willing to do that.

216
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:29,977
Other people ask me to do so.

217
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:34,882
Then you have alibi to beat them and to gamble money?

218
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:36,521
What you said suggests that...

219
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:38,857
to beat someone to the ground means

220
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:41,726
" How are you? Sorry for that." Is that right?

221
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:43,216
Fuck you.

222
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,526
Fuck you!

223
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,933
Let me go! Quickly, or I will beat you.

224
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:58,808
You are now a favorite!

225
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,912
I have made a mistake!

226
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:05,950
Don't come again, fucking boy!

227
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:13,322
Hongshan, I made a mistake. Don't leave me alone.

228
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:27,964
Hongshan, do you really quit?

229
00:35:33,945 --> 00:35:35,412
What can you do besides that?

230
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:42,720
Hey, well done! You should do this.

231
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,312
We have to make the business.

232
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:50,259
This is what we gambled today, take it!

233
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:02,134
But I want you to do a favor for me.

234
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:06,904
Don't do any job related to taking off the clothes, what's that in French?

235
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:09,404
What do you want?

236
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,082
You don't need to take care of that.

237
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:42,071
Do you still remember me?

238
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:46,547
We met in the train.

239
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,522
Qinghai is a fucking guy.

240
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:58,448
You stupid, look at me.

241
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:37,895
Are you insane?

242
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:39,464
Fuck you asshole! Dare you bully my brother?!

243
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:41,762
Come over here, you fucking pig.

244
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:56,709
You are too excessive. Apologize to Hongshan.

245
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:00,176
I'm sorry, Hongshan.

246
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:11,424
That's not enough.

247
00:39:11,929 --> 00:39:16,389
I said that I will decorate a drawing room after I buy a boat.

248
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,504
A drawing room? Some one paid the boat for 70 Francs.

249
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:23,065
You even didn't pay the rent on time.

250
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:26,978
Wait a moment, I bid for 100 Francs.

251
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:29,208
Do you peddler have 100 Francs?

252
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:31,671
Give me 1-month time.

253
00:39:33,351 --> 00:39:36,252
Ok, accept.

254
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,821
Ok! Shit, that's too bad.

255
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:30,305
I want to paint it as the sculpture in the square.

256
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,510
Is that your lover?

257
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:46,747
Not now. Now the enemy.

258
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:08,271
Do you really love her?

259
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:10,563
Sure.

260
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:14,406
For just once in bed? You are so decent in love.

261
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:16,875
I was just such person.

262
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,876
Ok, I give her to you.

263
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:22,713
It's fresh for you.

264
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:27,481
I'm so tired of that.

265
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:33,363
You give me 100 thousand Francs. Remember, that's 100 thousand.

266
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,985
What do you do tomorrow?

267
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:07,924
It's none of your business.

268
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:42,632
She's coming, I'll wait for you in the first floor.

269
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:39,483
What? Got beaten?

270
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:42,043
You are seriously injured.

271
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,946
We trust them too much.

272
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:47,725
I thought there was already a trap waiting for us.

273
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:49,460
You mean there's a hidden traitor among us?

274
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,485
No,  I doubt it was Hongshan's friend.

275
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,367
Every time when we divide the money, they feel some what envious.

276
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:03,574
Sorry! You were seriously injured! What a shame!

277
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:07,912
What a shame! How strong your fist is!

278
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:09,980
Only the body is strong.

279
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,279
Sure, we have regarded it too easy.

280
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:23,482
I don't want to do the same thing. Now I want to see you drawing.

281
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:26,721
What? See me drawing?

282
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:29,729
What's up? Won't you draw?

283
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,904
Do you want to have a portrait?

284
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:39,399
That's great! I am very much honored to have that.

285
00:46:44,615 --> 00:46:52,818
It seems as if I were drawing a portrait for beast. Does that hurt?

286
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:58,496
A little. I can still remember when I was fighting in the United States,

287
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,698
I was also injured.

288
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:03,166
But it's the first time I didn't fight back.

289
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:08,439
When you draw me the picture, please make it fancy.

290
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:11,465
Besides, the portrait of smiling.

291
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:15,546
Shut your mouth, and wait like a baby.

292
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:17,639
I am drawing carefully.

293
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:29,552
Who's that? What are you doing? Where are you going?

294
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:43,701
He ran away.

295
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:06,488
Son of bitch, you hurt him too much.

296
00:48:09,233 --> 00:48:11,497
Shit, are you kidding?

297
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,730
We don't have money for a bitch who repelled to his friend.

298
00:48:29,486 --> 00:48:33,217
My friend repelled me today.

299
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:38,222
But I understood him.

300
00:48:39,797 --> 00:48:46,100
He didn't want to lose his lovely boat.

301
00:48:47,972 --> 00:48:51,999
He dreamed of having a drawing room in that boat.

302
00:48:57,414 --> 00:49:04,149
This picture is drawn for me. How do you like it?

303
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:26,934
Boss, what do you want?

304
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:33,884
Rola,Rola.

305
00:49:33,884 --> 00:49:38,455
Rola! Ok. I will give it to her, please trust me.

306
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:40,514
That's fine.

307
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:47,964
You came back at last.

308
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:54,131
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

309
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:02,843
The guy who just came in gave this to you.

310
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:39,717
That's not enough, take some more with you!

311
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:41,412
I want to see Colin.

312
00:50:42,019 --> 00:50:43,816
It's impossible without sufficient money.

313
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:45,052
Just once.

314
00:50:57,034 --> 00:50:59,525
I'll take all money from his life.

315
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:07,774
With more meat.

316
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,041
Get away! Get away off me! Son of the bitch.

317
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:04,401
You let him go just because you turn soft-hearted to him?

318
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:05,869
He had stolen so much money from you,

319
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,237
and brought us into trouble,

320
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:09,797
we must give him a lesson.

321
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,986
Forget it, let him go!

322
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:14,093
I won't see you again.

323
00:54:01,218 --> 00:54:06,315
I'm sorry for beating you. It's just because...

324
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:12,529
Please stop doing the same business.

325
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:13,928
I don't need any help from you.

326
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:15,997
You needn't have worried about that.

327
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:19,369
Don't touch with the hand. It's poisonous.

328
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:21,894
Why do you take care of me?

329
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:26,276
Go away! Son of bitch,

330
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:28,870
That's enough! I'll beat you back if you don't leave now.

331
00:54:29,546 --> 00:54:31,810
Who made you feel so glorious today?

332
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,986
Think it over! What a fancy clothes you are wearing!

333
00:54:35,986 --> 00:54:37,783
What did you wear when you arrived in Paris?

334
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,125
Sure! I feel wronged to you.

335
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:44,328
Is that enough to just say a sorry?

336
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:46,396
You are the guy who merely knew how to fight.

337
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,065
These meat is for you.

338
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:50,465
I ate just a small piece! Son of the bitch.

339
00:55:08,919 --> 00:55:19,352
Am I beggar? Give me money! Go! Go!

340
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,435
Leave me alone here.

341
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:27,369
Have a nice life all alone!

342
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,945
Help! I can't swim!

343
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:07,275
Why did you rescue me? You have lost your shoes.

344
00:56:19,856 --> 00:56:22,017
That's Italian brand.

345
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:32,198
Shit! Shit!

346
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:46,883
Honey, give me a kiss.

347
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:52,253
I love you, you are so cute.

348
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:12,172
You son of the bitch.

349
00:57:24,654 --> 00:57:25,586
Annie.

350
00:57:26,656 --> 00:57:28,624
What's wrong here?

351
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:59,349
How much money has this guy taken with him?

352
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:09,798
Don't move!

353
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:19,365
My money...

354
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:56,905
Look at your face.

355
00:58:57,747 --> 00:58:59,078
Don't you feel ashamed?

356
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,752
Hongshan, I adore you.

357
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:17,200
The decent eyesight is seldom to see in Paris.

358
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,498
You eyes won't lie.

359
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:27,333
Please take me in again.

360
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:29,008
Drive him away!

361
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,720
I can do whatever you want.

362
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,881
You are kidding! What can you do?

363
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:00,699
Drive him away.

364
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:22,191
Stupid guy, what are you doing? Does it hurt?

365
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,835
Did I do a good job? It fucking hurts.

366
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:24,484
What are you doing? Don't run.

367
01:01:53,757 --> 01:01:57,523
When can I genuinely belong to you?

368
01:02:09,572 --> 01:02:12,876
Don't say that! Leave me alone please.

369
01:02:12,876 --> 01:02:15,111
Don't you like me?

370
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:18,515
But you have... which is not durable for me.

371
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:20,216
At least before I die I can't accept that.

372
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:21,918
You should behave like the chair in that picture.

373
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:25,149
accompanying me at any time.

374
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:43,764
Qinghai, Qinghai! Open the door.

375
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:14,924
My brother.

376
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:15,891
What's up, boss!

377
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:20,090
I heard that band has evil intentions against our entertainment place.

378
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,589
Go and fix them!

379
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:24,400
That's too risky, because they are all...

380
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,163
When did you learn to talk back to your boss?

381
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,036
Do what I order you to!

382
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:44,186
You said you would do whatever I want.

383
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:46,811
Yes.

384
01:05:59,369 --> 01:06:00,597
Then?

385
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:54,484
Emie, I love you! I derivate from the organisation.

386
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:55,917
I am happy to hear that!

387
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:02,389
The organisation will kill me, while they can definitely find me.

388
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:06,254
God bless us.

389
01:08:06,896 --> 01:08:09,524
I will kill whoever wants to kill Emie.

390
01:08:09,966 --> 01:08:11,934
I'll go with you.

391
01:08:12,468 --> 01:08:16,097
Nothing can stun our love.

392
01:08:38,461 --> 01:08:39,962
Just to watch the door?

393
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:41,122
Yes.

394
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,032
That's enough.

395
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:34,141
Hongshan, I forget it! Let me take something with me.

396
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:36,018
What?

397
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:37,815
I will be back soon.

398
01:09:46,562 --> 01:10:00,602
Emie, what's up? Emie, Emie...

399
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:48,749
Why can I hear a woman crying?

400
01:10:49,725 --> 01:10:53,462
That girl has just bathed, and she has beautiful chest.

401
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:55,726
I can't help feeling it! Let's go.

402
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:17,879
What the hell were you doing since yesterday?

403
01:12:18,648 --> 01:12:23,676
Did I ? I bought a watch.

404
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,418
It's for you! Rolex!

405
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,358
Rolex?

406
01:12:29,358 --> 01:12:30,086
Yes.

407
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:39,667
Thank you.

408
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:41,467
It suits you.

409
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,850
Did you make trouble in China restaurant?

410
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:58,718
Look at your face?!

411
01:12:59,722 --> 01:13:01,587
I knew from the beginning that it would be crisis for me.

412
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:03,953
So you were beaten like this?

413
01:13:06,996 --> 01:13:11,296
It's a shame, shit!

414
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:16,798
Hongshan, come here.

415
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:27,850
Hongshan, before this candle is burning off,

416
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:32,787
kick them ass! Do it quickly.

417
01:13:36,926 --> 01:13:38,052
Quickly.

418
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:49,698
No, not like this.

419
01:13:50,106 --> 01:13:51,130
Look at me.

420
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,564
Take off the hat.

421
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:02,409
Excuse me.

422
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:27,369
Does the candle dies off itself?

423
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:42,050
This time I want Hongshan to kill someone.

424
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:48,022
I want you to kill a man.

425
01:14:52,334 --> 01:14:54,029
I don't want to kill anyone.

426
01:14:57,439 --> 01:14:58,633
He refused to do so.

427
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:04,079
Ok! I'll give you time to think it over.

428
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:05,103
I will do it.

429
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:07,114
You are not qualified.

430
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:10,981
It's impossible even if you're willing to.

431
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:17,723
Why?

432
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:19,719
Wasn't it just a threaten to them?

433
01:15:21,831 --> 01:15:22,991
Do you really regard it such simple stuff?

434
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,768
It's bloody! To be,

435
01:15:25,768 --> 01:15:28,202
or not to be!

436
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:31,674
Forget it if it's no big problem.

437
01:15:31,674 --> 01:15:34,165
We have come to the end! We can never turn around.

438
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:41,312
You have changed so much and become very horrible.

439
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:49,588
Yes, I did it, not you.

440
01:15:50,993 --> 01:15:55,487
They were all killed by me! I would take the full responsibility.

441
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:01,360
It's my fault if there's any problem.

442
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:12,880
The boss becomes aware of it, let's make it soon.

443
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:19,080
That won't be easy! He liked us.

444
01:16:19,555 --> 01:16:21,891
I'm afraid we will be embarrassed at that time.

445
01:16:21,891 --> 01:16:23,158
Whom will you support at that time?

446
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:25,027
Of course you.

447
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:27,696
Then we should kill Hongshan first.

448
01:16:27,696 --> 01:16:29,129
which cannot be easy at all.

449
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,233
What are you doing now?

450
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:42,044
It's you who don't keep your word.

451
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:45,172
Wait a moment! I will take the money, you bitch.

452
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:53,846
100 Francs.

453
01:16:56,659 --> 01:16:58,794
You think I'm for just 100 Francs

454
01:16:58,794 --> 01:17:00,022
to retreat my friend?

455
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:07,101
Do you like eel?

456
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,964
Eel? Which eel?

457
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:18,881
The fish which has never eaten a man,

458
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:22,180
can watch the stomach of a man, is that interesting?

459
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:47,643
Shan, if a man was thrown to the sea with handcuffs,

460
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:49,378
what will happen?

461
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:50,310
What?

462
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:54,841
He would survive under some special conditions.

463
01:17:55,684 --> 01:17:57,709
What are you now talking about?

464
01:18:01,223 --> 01:18:02,424
Ok, give me your hand.

465
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:03,959
Our friendship will never change!

466
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:05,324
We live together,

467
01:18:10,132 --> 01:18:13,260
and also die together! Prost!

468
01:18:21,176 --> 01:18:22,734
I'll get some food.

469
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:28,946
These are the keys.

470
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:30,879
I will be back soon.

471
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:37,921
Open the handcuffs. It's not some kind of joke.

472
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:43,329
No, I won't untie it! You should do it yourself.

473
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:48,035
You can surely survive, because I trust you.

474
01:18:49,171 --> 01:18:50,536
Are you kidding?

475
01:19:08,724 --> 01:19:13,161
No, you are now crazy! Calm down.

476
01:19:13,862 --> 01:19:16,797
It's not the right place for you who look like the man from village.

477
01:19:27,843 --> 01:19:30,835
I can rescue Colin only when I kill you.

478
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:33,046
Then I can take the sculptures which favors Colin.

479
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:45,182
You really want me to die? I will commit suicide if that's your willing!

480
01:19:45,761 --> 01:19:51,393
I hope you a happy life!

481
01:19:52,434 --> 01:19:58,395
And there's nothing to feel guilty! The future will be bright.

482
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:59,734
Room 307...two men?

483
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:12,272
Come in!

484
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,715
I will do that.

485
01:21:49,718 --> 01:21:59,628
It' 1500000 Francs, in room 307 Bica Hotel.

486
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,493
Kill that guy.

487
01:24:41,423 --> 01:24:44,586
Honey, honey! Wake up.

488
01:28:56,411 --> 01:28:57,400
Come in.

489
01:30:58,633 --> 01:31:00,191
Do you still remember?

490
01:31:00,802 --> 01:31:05,206
When I retreated you, you beaten me to die! At that moment...

491
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:13,580
I wanna get beaten from you! Beat me.

492
01:31:16,151 --> 01:31:18,346
The heart will break when you beat someone.

493
01:31:20,822 --> 01:31:22,221
Please.

494
01:31:41,743 --> 01:31:43,506
Really?

495
01:32:04,265 --> 01:32:06,028
Can you withstand it?

496
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,001
Hold on!

497
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:57,278
This boat will be yours.

498
01:32:59,053 --> 01:33:03,080
Hold it! Quickly.

499
01:33:22,577 --> 01:33:24,101
It's  fairly good work, isn't it?

500
01:33:25,246 --> 01:33:27,009
Finish it.

501
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:40,254
Come out quickly.

502
01:34:40,254 --> 01:34:44,156
Quickly...

503
01:35:20,294 --> 01:35:21,886
Come in quickly.

504
01:35:25,366 --> 01:35:28,927
Quickly.

505
01:35:32,106 --> 01:35:34,700
They seem to kill us.

506
01:35:40,848 --> 01:35:42,145
What can we do?

507
01:35:50,892 --> 01:35:52,223
The fucking guy.

508
01:39:47,795 --> 01:39:48,784
An idea comes through my mind...

509
01:39:49,597 --> 01:39:52,088
that it's lovely days when we perform in the street. 

510
01:39:52,533 --> 01:39:53,363
That's right.

511
01:39:54,035 --> 01:39:56,799
Let's sleeve the bricks in the square.

512
01:39:57,171 --> 01:39:58,263
Is that ok?

513
01:39:58,706 --> 01:40:00,731
Of course.
