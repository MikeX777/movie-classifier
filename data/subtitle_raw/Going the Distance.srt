00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,966
She's been gone for weeks, pal.
Get over it.

186
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,510
Come on, you see
those waves out there?

187
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,068
They're gorgeous.

188
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,944
I've been surfing with a hard-on
all morning.

189
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,745
Come on. You want in?

190
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,513
Tyler, in all the years
you've known me,

191
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,850
have I ever gone surfing?

192
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,787
Oh, Nick, look at you.

193
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,757
You call this a life?

194
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,088
It's about
taking chances, man.

195
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,128
Kicking ass.

196
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,857
Look at Dime out there.

197
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,264
He's a total feeb,
and he risks dying

198
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,824
every time
he goes out there,

199
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,371
yet he keeps doing it.
Do you know why?

200
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,066
Uh, yeah, what is it?

201
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,870
Carpe Diem.
Seize the day?

202
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,467
Got it.

203
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,411
I don't think you do.

204
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,852
Excuse me?

205
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,355
Can you give me
a hand here?

206
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,789
I'm having trouble
with my straps.

207
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,918
Uh... yeah.

208
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,552
Sure.

209
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,793
Come on in.

210
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,864
You know, I'm not really good
with knots,

211
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,928
but I can tell...

212
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,030
you've got really great hands.

213
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,301
Thanks.

214
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,866
I bet you're really good
with them.

215
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,506
Yeah, I bet you are.

216
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,879
You know... I'm, uh...

217
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,882
I'm seeing someone,

218
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,885
so I'm a little
emotionally unavailable.

219
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,319
That's okay. We'll just leave
our emotions out of it.

220
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,049
Really, I'm flattered,
thank you, but...

221
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,954
Oh, come on.

222
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,586
I mean, they said you'd be tough,
but I am half-naked here.

223
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,631
They? Who's they?

224
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,189
Um...

225
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,326
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, bud.

226
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,734
We're just trying to,
you know, cheeryou up a little bit,

227
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,329
get your mind off Trish.

228
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,874
Oh, and she gave us
a terrific rate.

229
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,341
Yeah, well...

230
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,207
You guys got me a hooker?

231
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,211
Oh, no, no.

232
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,838
I'm a massage therapist.

233
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,884
But for an extra 50,
I can, you know...

234
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,442
No. I have a girlfriend!
And she's beautiful,

235
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,953
and smart,
and going somewhere.

236
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,422
And afterthese
Much Music Awards are over,

237
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,686
she's going to come back here...
- Whoa.

238
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,694
The Much Music Video Awards?
- Yeah.

239
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,729
Let me guess.

240
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,959
Internship
with Lenny Swackhammer?

241
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,557
You know him?

242
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,536
Oh, I know him all right.
All nine inches, in fact.

243
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,835
I had your girlfriend's job
last year. That Swackhammer,

244
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,866
he made those awards
one hell of a night.

245
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,004
Whoo!

246
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,047
Wait. Wait.

247
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,412
What are you talking about?

248
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,075
Well, I don't remember much,

249
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,587
but I do recall me and Swacky
in a Nickelback sandwich.

250
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,180
The Swackhammer intern deluxe.

251
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,157
Apparently, it's a tradition.

252
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,887
Want a demonstration?

253
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,589
No, actually,
I've got to go.

254
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,097
Can I keep this?

255
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,725
Oh, yeah.
Sure, babe, sure.

256
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,894
Oh, hey, you want
a free nipple ring?

257
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,699
Yeah!

[Horn honks]

259
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:23,871
Nick!

260
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,179
Free booze.
Get your ass out here!

261
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,517
Dude, a beertruck just
jackknifed on the highway.

262
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,921
A river of pale ale on the numberfour.
Let's go check it out.

263
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,085
Sorry, guys.
I got to sit this one out.

264
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,425
I've got some packing to do.
One-way ticket to Toronto.

265
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,123
Flight leaves in the morning.

266
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,460
You're flying out to see Trish?

267
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,229
Why?
The girl has a full-time job.

268
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,394
She doesn't have time...

269
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,199
I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

270
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,934
It looks real, doesn't it?

271
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,067
It cost me 10 bucks.

272
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,303
Hopefully it'll tide her over

273
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,938
till I can get her
something better, but...

274
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,311
What?

275
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,111
You guys think she's going
to know it's fake?

276
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,483
Have you lost yourfucking mind?

277
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,782
Dude, I'm just taking your advice.

278
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,755
You see something you want,
you go for it.

279
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,759
I meant get drunk, get laid,
go skydiving,

280
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,819
not throw your life away.

281
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:11,828

[Revs engine]

283
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,094
Congratulations.

Hey, hey, hey.

285
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,237
Who wants brownies?

286
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,338
Not right now, thanks.

287
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,349
Oh, yeah.
Oh, and listen, son,

288
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,349
we're, uh...

289
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,511
Sorry about that whole
whore thing.

290
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,714
I thought she was
a massage therapist.

291
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,915
Honey...

292
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,787
We just want to make sure
you're doing this

293
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,258
because you love Trish,

294
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,352
not because
she finally popped your cherry.

295
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,488
Stop saying that.

296
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,929
Guys, I love her.

297
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,933
Okay? I really do.

298
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,468
Fine, fine, fine.
Have a brownie.

Congrats on the wedding.
Let's drink.

302
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,105
I thought you didn't approve.

303
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,442
I don't.

off to the slaughter

that out, please?

Oh, thank god.

hook me up with that recipe.

cut that out?

stop you?

to Banff before, okay,

taste like corn.

725
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,063
This is life.

726
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,100
Smell it. It smells like life.

727
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:18,793

I say we knock him out.

737

744
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,591
So how is our little tugboat
this morning?

745

Tugboat?
What are you talking about?

746
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,018
Let's just say yourtypically...

747
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,531
private time with kleenex
and a little lube...

748
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,760
It kind of became
a public event.

749
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,996
Wankapalooza, you know?
We could've sold tickets.

750
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,004
- You're joking me.
- Dude, you were like a chimp.

751
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,437
Okay?

752
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,873
You were begging us to join you.

753
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,037
You know, some things
are just a little sacred.

754
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,577
Okay, everyone,
I'll be in the lake.

755
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:41,583
Yeah, so will I.

756
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:44,086
That is a good idea.
I'm going to grab my towel.

757
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,419
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

758
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,186
Sasha, we're dipping in shifts.

759
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,590
Sorry, boys.

760
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,355
I'll keep an eye
on the pervs.

761
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,056
What a prude.

762
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,065
Bye, boys.

763
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,658
Come on, Dime. Let's go inside
and root through their panties.

Nick, you're, uh...

765
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,135
You're sweeping the forest.

766
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,405
You sure you're still not tripping out?
A little zoom-zoom?

767
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,344
You guys are messing
with me, right?

768
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:12,280
I got to tell you,

769
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,319
that little tribal thing
you were doing last night,

770
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:19,254
it was pretty impressive.

771
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,689
Help me with this?

772
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,058

Oh, man, Nick's going to kill us.

775
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:42,874
Not when he sees these pictures.

776
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,517
We're going to hell.

777
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,247
Okay, let's face this, pal.

778
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,312
You're not going
to get in Jill's pants.

779
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,618
This is the next best thing.

780
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:54,919
All right? Look around.

781
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,951

Nothing.

wearing her swimsuit.

I eat, Dime. I exercise.

801

This branch is not going
to hold me, all right?

802

and masturbate.

Easy, law boy, I'm a musician.
I'll do what I want, okay?

buy us very much.

00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,348
Stop shooting me!

907
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,217
The pussy's down.
Go forthe face.

908
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:09,657
Forget the face.
Go forthe balls.

909
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,024
Honey, any time now.
Can somebody...

910
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,460
All right, gentlemen,

911
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,469

914
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,937
Oh, you were great.
- Thanks.

915
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,840
What are you guys doing?

916
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,243
At this rate,
about 75 bucks an hour.

917
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,337
[Screaming]

918
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,177
Excellent. All right.

919
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,149
Guys, where's, uh,
where's Tyler?

920
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,676
Where you going?
Get back here!

921

[Roaring]

922
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:42,815
How does this feel?

923
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,092
Now who's the little pussies?
Huh?

924
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,997
Yeah! Take that!

925
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,967
Look at you!

926
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,697
What?

927
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,238
[Laughing]

928
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:57,240
Shut up.

929
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,617
[Clattering]

930
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,449
What's that noise?
You guys hearthat?

931
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,581
Hey guys, what's this for?

932
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,590
It's a...

933
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,559
detour.

934
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,382
Buckle up, suckers.

935
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,284
Oh, yeah, this...
this way seems much better.

936
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,222
There's shit falling down
and stuff.

937
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,657
If the RV's a-rocking,

938
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,456
don't come a-knocking!

939
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,722
[Laughing]

940
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,371
This piece of shit's
falling apart.

941
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,906
You should've bought Japanese.

942
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,842
Shit.

943
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,512
We got to get off these
freaking tracks, okay?

944
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,193
[Train whistle blows]

945
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,500
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

946
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:43,745
Nick, hurry up!

947
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:44,781
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

948
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,281
Nick, get...

949
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,113
Oh, my god...
- I'm trying!

950
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,179
Oh, shit.

951
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,551
Shit. We're stuck!

952
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,456
Oh, shit.

953
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,859
Get out of there!

954
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,660
Everybody, out! Get out!

955
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,599
For god's sake,
what are you doing? Get out!

956
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:10,867
My guitar!

957
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:32,158
Oh, no.

958
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,287
Oh.

959
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,931
My surfboard.

960
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:39,969
My Gibson.

961
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:40,969
My home.

962
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,973
Is everyone okay?

963
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,668
Maybe we should, uh...

964
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,233
go talk to somebody
or something?

965
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,609
We'll be stuck
filling out reports for a week.

966
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,011
Let's split.

967
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,016
Are we going to Toronto or not?

968
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,073
Yeah, let's...

969
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,086
let's get out of here, guys.
Come on.

970
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,485
Come on, Sash.

971
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,749
Coming.

972
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,018
Hurry up. Come on.

973
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:12,999
It's not bad.

974
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,002
It tastes like Prairie girls.

975
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,871
You don't know
what Prairie girls taste like.

976
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,272
It could use a little salt.

977
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,072
Butter.

978
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,342
I'm sure the farmer's got some.
Do you think he'd mind?

979
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,217
Thou shalt not steal.

980
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,777
Wait, wait.
Um, listen, we're sorry.

981
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,722
We're just a couple of kids
on our way to Toronto.

982
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,384
You with the Callahan boys?

983
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,394
Spreading gypsy moths...

984
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,895
killing my crops.

985
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,091
No, sir.
No gypsy moths here, sir.

986
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,101
No, listen,
we're just passing through.

987
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,466
Our Winnebago got hit
by a train.

988
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,402
We have no stuff...

989
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,372
That was you? Why...

990
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,671
caught wind of that
on the old transistor.

991
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:58,408
It's a miracle
you kids are alive.

992
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:02,816
Shucks, this here's a test.

993
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,013
The Lord brought you here,

994
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,147
and now...

995
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,692
I am your shepherd.

996
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,756
So how about
a home-cooked meal

997
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,696
and a warm place to sleep?

998
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,028
Sounds great.

999
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,261
You'll be bunkin' in
with the cows tonight.

1000
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,270
I hope you're not
lactose intolerant.

1001
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,566
All I ask

1002
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:26,598
is that no one taint the purity
of my virgin daughter.

1003
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,202
Oh, yeah. I get it.
It's like the old farmer's joke.

1004
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,110
You know,
"You can sleep in my barn,

1005
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,773
but don't you dare touch

1006
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,047
my gorgeous,
cock-hungry teenage girl."

1007
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,019
It's no joke, son.

1008
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,922
In fact, in my house,
it's the 11th commandment.

1009
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:46,861
Thou shalt not lie...
with thy farmer's offspring.

Unless thou wish
the wrath

1012

of thy farmer's boom-stick.

1013
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,695
Got it?

1014
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,864
Yes, sir.

1015
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,743
Who's hungry?

Oh, a train accident.

1019
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,453
You poor souls.

1020
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,823
Praise the Lord
you're all okay.

1021
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,864
Everything looks
wonderful, Mrs...

1022
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,423
My name's Libby,
and this is Joseph.

1023
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,559
How do?

1024
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,070
And Josephine
will be down in a moment.

1025
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,868
Josephine!

1026
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,670
Hey, dude.

1027
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,712
How hot do you think this girl is?
- Dude, you're kidding me.

1028
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,940
These people are hideous.
She probably has no teeth.

1029
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,861
Ah, Josephine.

1030
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,092
You finally decided to join us?

1031
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,527
Hi.

1032
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,230
God help us.

1033
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,567
Oh, hi, sweetie.

1034
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,607
You're just in time.

1035
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,974
Oh, have you met
the boys?

1036
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,578
Hi.

1037

- Hi.
- Hi.

1038
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,782
So, young man,

1039
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,618
you mentioned you had a...

1040
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:24,024
a joke back there
in the cornfield, huh?

1041
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,790
Uh, yeah. It's a doozy.

1042
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,293
[Clears throat]

1043
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,736
Will you please excuse me?
I'm not feeling very well.

1044
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,973
Oh, dear, she does this
every time we have guests.

1045
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,986
Poor girl's just so darn shy.

1046
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,488
So, you there.

1047
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:54,785
Yeah, you.

1048
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,325
Make us laugh.

1049
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,725
Uh, yeah, the, uh...

1050
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:02,390

Um, sure, what the hell?

1051
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,934
Tyler, I don't think
it's a good idea.

1052
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,196
So there's these three guys

1053
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,736
that bagged
the farmer's daughter.

1054
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,772
Oh.

1055
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,104
Of course, uh,
the old man finds out,

1056
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,767
and goes and grabs a shotgun

1057
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,368
much like yours...

1058
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,881
You know, Tyler,
maybe you shouldn't.

1059
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,541
Uh, so he explains
their punishment to them,

1060
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,551
that they have to go
to the orchard

1061
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,281
and find theirfavourite fruit.

1062
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,050
And anyhow, the guys
think they get off easy,

1063
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,649
so they go
and get theirfruit of choice...

1064
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:30,852
[unzipping]
Oh, oh, god.

1065
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,191
You okay? Uh, yeah.

1066
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,696
Do you hearthat, Joseph?

1067
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,528
This darling young man

1068
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,865
has volunteered to say grace.

1069
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,699
Go ahead, son.

1070
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,935
Uh... uh...

1071
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,236
Uh, dear Lord...

1072
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:51,042
thank you for giving us
such a...

1073
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,140
succulent meal,

1074
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,082
and bless us,

1075
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,620
and please forgive us

1076
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,382
for anything
that we've done

or are...
are doing right now.

1078
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,117
And don't...
don't stop loving us.

1079
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,127
Don't stop, baby.

1080
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:09,393
Please, don't stop, oh...

1081
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,263
And, uh...

1082
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,826
And let us
just swallow our sins

1083
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,338
and...

1084
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,998
Oh...

1085
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,508

1266
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,485
Hey, you're...
you're supposed to be dead.

1267
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:54,818
Stay away from us!

1268
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,222
But how did you get out...

1269
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,385
Sorry, pal.
This boy belongs to us.

1270
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,485
You, let's go.

1271
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,563
Come on, slick.
Let's get comfortable.

1272
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,198
Okay, but I'm no cheap whore.

1273
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,901
You're buying me breakfast.

1274
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:16,969
[Laughs]
I don't think so.

1275
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,310
Jill?

1276
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,714
Jill, open up.

1277
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,887
I guess it's me and you.

1278
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,896
I have been dreaming
about this

1279
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,934
my entire life.

1280
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:41,368
Oh, I bet you have.

1281
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,371
Ooh, ouch!

1282
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,067
Ah.

01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,337
Yeah, come on.
Get them off.

1284
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,276
Hola!

1285
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,179
Here we go.

1286
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,946
What are those for?

1287
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,581
Oh, you just wait and see,
little man. Hmm?

1288
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,583
I really wanted to.

1289
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,991
Yeah, well, so did I,

1290
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,621
but we can wait
for anothertime.

1291
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,165
You're so sweet.

1292
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,962
Kiss me.

1293
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:15,027
Are you sure, because it looked like
you're kind of about to release.

1294
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:16,366
Just kiss me.

1295
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,271

1297
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,676
Oh, God.

01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,612
Shh. Okay, uh...

1299
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,353
You were great tonight.

1300
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:43,561
That girl on stage,
who is she?

1301
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,063
Did you like her?

1302
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:54,573
You take the bed.
I'm going to...

1303
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,078
We paid good money
forthis bed,

1304
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:02,812
and I demand
that we enjoy it.

1305
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,582
Are you suggesting we share?

1306
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:10,353
As long as you don't
get any ideas.

1307
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,186
I don't get ideas.

1308
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,559
Nice and tight,

1309

1310
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,736
Yee-haw!

1311
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,108
So how does this work?

1312
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,168
How am I supposed to earn
my brown belt this way?

1313
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:07,080
Oh, you will, big boy.

1314
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:08,640
Don't you worry.

1315
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,447
Whateveryou're doing
back there,

1316
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,852
just be careful,
because I bruise easy.

1317
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,715
What do you think, Claire?

1318
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,283
Should we use
the baby carrot

1319
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,988
orthe Excalibur?

1320
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,121
Baby carrot. Baby carrot.

1321
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,996
Gosh, honey,

1322
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,535
it looks like we left
the carrot at home.

1323
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,336
Too bad.
So very, very sad.

1324
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:35,070
Load me up.

01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,007
Oh, dear Lord.

1326

Oh, my god.

Your place is way bigger
than ours.

1346

Could somebody
just give me a hand, please?

1347
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,837
Does your new friend
have a name?

1348
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,931
You got hickeys.

1349
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:14,810
No, it's just a rash.

1350
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,209
Dude, you nailed Sasha.

1351
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,440
You nailed my Sasha?

1352
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,482
- I didn't nail anybody.
- Hey. Nick, come here.

1353

What?
Nick, some details, buddy.

I knew you guys
were going to hook up.

1355

Give us the juice, my friend.

we come bearing gifts.

1369

You think you can shut me up
with a lousy mickey of booze?

1370
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:13,691
You're kidding.

Make yourself at home.

1374

Hey, this train goes
through Toronto, right?

1375
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:24,476
Toronto, yes?

1376
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,674
Of course it does.

1377
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,926
Hey, uh,
mind if I have a little hit?

1378
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,196
Beat it.

turning this down, right?

You had sex with me
by mistake?

What, did you slip
and fall and accidentally...

1387
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,894
We were drunk.

1388
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:22,369
We had a one-night stand.
It was good, but that's it.

1389

It wasn't that good,
so don't flatteryourself.

to law school.

I can't believe we made it.

1414

No, you told me
we were stopping in Toronto.

1420
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,593
You said "through Toronto."

1421
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,064
You didn't say anything
about stopping.

1422
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,864

the rest of my weed.

Did you get through?

1444
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,295
Yeah.

1445
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,597
And?

1446
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:10,969
As soon as dad found out
I was in a strip club,

1447
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,372
he offered me
a plane ticket home.

1448
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:16,172
You're not going home,
are you, Sasha?

1449
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,042
What about Toronto?
What about your music?

1450
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:22,209
This is just not my scene, Jill.
I mean...

1451
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,445
Please, Sasha, you can't,
you can't just leave me.

1452
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,750
I need you.
Forget about Nick.

1453
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,619
Just do it for me.
Stay. Don't leave.

1454
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,158
Don't leave, don't leave.
Please.

1455
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,158
Okay.

1456
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,285
I'll stay.

1457
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:35,990
She's a super freak
Super freak

1458
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:39,865
She's a very special girl

1459
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,630
Well, I'm still hungry.
Who wants thirds?

1460
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:42,636
Oh, I'm in.

1461
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:44,400
Hey, there.

1462
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:47,772
Can I interest you boys
in a little... dance?

1463
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,107
Nope.

1464
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,579
Well, how about a massage, then?

1465
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:53,740
We're fine.

1466
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,181
Well, at least buy a drink.

1467
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,515
Can't afford it.

1468
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,747
This isn't a deli.
You can't just come here and eat.

1469
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:02,683
Look, lady,

1470
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,123
unless those are
breasts of chicken

1471
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,718
that you're packing,
we're not buying.

1472
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,422
Right.

1473
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:10,761
R-row!

1474
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,666
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1475
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,033
Hey.

1476
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,072
The sign says,
"All you can eat fortwo bucks."

1477
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,436
We paid it, asshole.

1478
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:22,068
Hey, she said I could touch her.
I had permission, dammit.

1479
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,941
You know what?
Le Pamplemousse.

1480
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,208
Hey, these guys
are Swollen Members.

1481
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,715
No, they're not.

1482
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,341
Swollen's in Toronto
performing at the awards.

1483
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,885
Our set's not forthree hours.

1484
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:34,445
We thought we'd get a lap dance
before we hit the road.

1485
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:36,855
- Prev fucked it up, though.
- Wasn't my fault.

1486
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:38,256
You guys are going to T.O.?

1487
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,488
Yo, ourflight leaves
in, like, an hour.

1488
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,223
Why, you guys need a lift?

1489
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,626
Nick,

1490
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,969
Swollen Members
have video games on the airplane.

1491
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,977
Oh, Prevail.
You're such a riot.

1492
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,975
Ladies and gentlemen,
the MMVAs.

1493
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:00,982
Welcome to
the Much Music Video Awards,

1494
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,984
Featuring, live,
Avril Lavigne...

1495
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,885
Hey, these are live.
Aren't we missing them?

1496
01:12:05,954 --> 01:12:07,615
No, man, relax.
It's just a pre-game.

1497
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,157
We'll be right on time.

1498
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:14,218
...Fifi Dobson, Pilate
and Swollen Members.

1499
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:15,888
It's kind of frustrating, isn't it?

1500
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:17,454
What is?

1501
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,091
We haven't been alone
since the Prairies.

1502
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,762
Yeah, that sucks.

1503
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,965
And here we are
on a private jet,

1504
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,372
a few... miles high.

1505
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,502
Yeah, it's awesome.

1506
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:31,478
Miles high.

1507
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:34,015
Oh. Oh... oh!

1508
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,017
Shh.

1509
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,712
As usual,
the party continues here

1510
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,777
at the big pre-game show,
and look at this.

1511
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,516
The best part
about this red carpet

1512
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,024
is all the stars who show up,
and here's a famous one,

1513
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,788
record producer
Mr. Lenny Swackhammer.

1514
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:46,793
How are you, sir?

1515
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,557
Oh, shit.
It's Swackhammer, man.

1516
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,858
You know that guy?

1517
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,526
Everybody knows the Swack.

1518
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:53,932
You got three nominations
this year.

1519
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,594
How do you think
you're gonna fare?

1520
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,935
- It's Hammertime, baby.
- Who's yourfriend?

1521
01:12:58,006 --> 01:12:59,371
Trish?

1522
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,772
Who's Trish?

1523
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,812
- It's my girlfriend.
- Are you sure?

1524
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,962
Okay. Shh, shh.

1525
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:29,397
No, no.

1526
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:30,403
Oh, god.

1527
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:33,737
Please, I'm not even here.
Come on, shh. It's okay.

1528
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:37,006
Hey, I love you guys.

1529
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,740
Yeah, you guys too.

1530
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:40,145
Swollen Members.

1531
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,182
Yeah.

1532
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:44,619
Uh...

1533
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,348
It's, uh, sweat.

1534
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,947
[Cheering]

1535
01:13:56,098 --> 01:14:01,126
Are you aware
of what you make me feel

1536
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:05,367
Baby right now
I feel invisible to you

1537
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,875
Like I'm not real

1538
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:12,346
Didn't you feel me
lock my arms around you

1539
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,473
Why did you turn away

1540
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,917
Here's what I have to say

1541
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:20,819
I was left to cry there
waiting outside there

1542
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:22,686
Grinning with a lost stare

1543
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,817
The action continues.
Swollen Members have arrived.

1544
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:27,589
Mocha, Avril just got on.
You guys are next.

1545
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,893
- Whatever, George.
- Whoo. I rock!

1546
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:34,527
'Cause you weren't there
when I was scared

1547
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:36,696
I was so alone

1548
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,240
You...

1549
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,003
You need to listen

1550
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,534
I'm starting to trip
I'm losing my grip

1551
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:47,241
And I'm in this thing alone

1552
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,510
Yo.

1553
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,347
Whoo-hoo!

1554
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:51,477
Gob!

1555
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,680
Gob is here,
and they're drinking free booze.

1556
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:54,687
All right!

1557
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,417
Who the fuck is this guy?

1558
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,982
Uh, it's our little bitch.

1559
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,085
He performs tricks
and simple errands.

1560
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,424
You want to borrow him?

1561
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,429
Sure.

1562
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,430
Beat it.

1563
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,431
Excuse me.

1564
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,762
I'm looking for Trish Robinson.

1565
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,961
She's an intern here.
She's got long blonde hair...

1566
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,697
Oh, rocket of an ass, right?

1567
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:11,136
Yeah, she's totally around.

1568
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:12,764
Know what?
Try the other side.

1569
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:15,241
- Thanks.
- Hey, can I buy you a free drink?

1570
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,744
Uh, honey, don't you think
we have some unfinished business

1571
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,678
to attend to?
- What? Here?

1572
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,680
Mm-hmm.

1573
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:21,647
Where?

1574
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,844
[Giggling]

1575
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:25,011
Trish!

1576
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:26,611
Nick?

1577
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:27,882
Hey!

1578
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,356
Oh, my god.
What are you doing here?

1579
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:31,483
I came to see you.

1580
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,084
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.

1581
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,753
We need to talk.

1582
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,627
It's so good to see you.

1583
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:41,768
Let's go somewhere
a little bit more private.

1584
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:44,567
If you don't care
then I don't care

1585
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,076
We're not going anywhere

1586
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,420
Deep throat this, bitch.

1587
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,081
[Groans]

1588
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,556
You can do it.

1589
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,683
Tom, the fruit tray.

1590
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,727
That's good.

1591
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:10,928
You guys rock!

1592
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:11,897
Hey, guys.

1593
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,958
What's going on?
That was awesome.

1594
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:14,968
Good show. Good show.

1595
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,026
Who's the cowboy?

1596
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:17,503
He's no cowboy.

1597
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,064
He's a banana-eating,
deep-throating bitch.

1598
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,302
You want him?

1599
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,741
No, I want a beer.

1600
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,743
Give her a beer.

1601
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,439
That's not beer.

1602
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,948
That's water.

1603
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:34,021
That sucks.

1604
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,989
To the green room!

1605
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:38,083
You guys are great.
That was funny.

1606
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,628
Let's go!

1607
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:43,187
Okay. Outside, I'll meet yas.

1608
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,630
Excuse me.

1609
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,760
Do you work for me?

1610
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:50,770
No.

1611
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,101
Well, you should.

1612
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:54,335
'Cause you would make
an outstanding assistant.

1613
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,707
What do you say

1614
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,042
we go somewhere...

1615
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,207
swing the Hammerfor a while?
- Um...

1616
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,215
Hammer, you're on five.

1617
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:04,718
Yeah, thanks.

1618
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:05,878
Swing the Hammer later, yeah?
