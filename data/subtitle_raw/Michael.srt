1
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,333
Which group did this?

2
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,208
Who all were involved in this?

3
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,625
Tell me.

4
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,000
How long were you sketching this plan?

5
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,416
How many people were involved in planning
Tell me.

6
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,125
Tell me.

7
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,583
Otherwise, I'll blow your brains out.
I know that you are aware of it.

8
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:54,875
I know.

9
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:06,625
No one knows him better than me.

10
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,833
This story didn't start a few days ago,

11
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:26,208
it started fifteen years ago
or maybe even earlier than that.

12
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,375
There are two kinds of people in this world.

13
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,666
One who pushes a non-swimmer into a water body and laughs at
him,

14
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:47,000
and another who jumps right into the sea without
any formal swimming training to swim across the sea.

15
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,583
He is the second type.

16
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,375
He is hunting for someone.

17
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:42,083
Whoever he is searching for,
it is defintely not a good news for them.

18
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,791
Sir, please help me. My son has a very high fever.

19
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:08,625
Sir, please give me my salary.
I beg you. I need to get him to the hospital.

20
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:13,541
There are still 4 more days to your salary date.
-Sir, my son's life is in danger.

21
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,750
Please save my child, sir.
I am asking for my money, sir.

22
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,125
Sir, I couldn't come to work as
I was taking care of him.

23
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:27,708
Don't you understand? Go, get out.
-Sir…sir…

24
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,708
-Sir! Sir!
-Hey, give me a cup of tea.

25
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,750
Okay

26
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:38,166
Hey do your work
-Bloody rascal, don't you have any mercy on my child?

27
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,166
Bloody scoundrel, I curse you.
You will die a horrible death and rot in hell.

28
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:57,833
This is my curse, you will surely be ruined!

29
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,875
Who are you? Who are you?

30
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:32,958
Don't ever beg for something that is rightfully yours.
You must take it.

31
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,041
What is your name, son?

32
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:17,458
There will come a day when you won't need any introduction
and your name will be known to everyone.

33
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:33,333
You will rule this land.

34
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:39,625
At that time, he didn't know what that land was
or what ruling even meant.

35
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:46,083
Moreover, he was unaware of the fact that
somebody else was already ruling that land.

36
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:50,500
Guru Nath - the emperor ruling this kingdom!

37
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,208
If you build a temple for all the demonic actions
that took place over the last 20 years,

38
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:58,875
the idol in that temple will be of Gurunath.

39
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,750
I used to think like you - that one has to be
honest and work hard to prosper in life.

40
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,250
But later I realized that being honest and working hard
is...

41
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:14,375
a principle invented by rich people to keep
people working under them forever under them.

42
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,458
When real estate prices were at its peaks,

43
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:23,916
the cost of land was on the rise,
and the cost of human lives was on a downfall.

44
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,583
Nobody knows where Gurunath came from

45
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:32,500
but everyone knows that the inception
of bar culture in this city was due to him.

46
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:50,541
To tell more about him, his violence is also artistic;

47
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:55,708
he believes that the world around him should be under his
feet.

48
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:01,333
The only person who can veto Gurunath's word, is his wife.

49
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,208
Gurunath listens only to Charulatha,

50
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,875
And Charulatha's world revolves around her son,
Amarnath.

51
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:14,166
Not only that, her pride, dignity, honour,
everything is Amarnath.

52
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,416
You tell me that I am misunderstanding
and you take that matter on a light note.

53
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,250
Why don't you trust me, Guru?

54
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,500
Before Gurunath's brother developed
an aspiration for Gurunath's authority,

55
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,750
she made him crave his life and made him leave.

56
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,458
I don't believe that but you should no longer stay with me.

57
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,375
Go to any place you like,
I'll get the arrangements done.

58
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,291
Due to respect for his brother, he left.

59
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,958
Nobody knows about his whereabouts.

60
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,500
Everyone thinks that Charulatha got him killed.

61
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,750
That is a rumour.

62
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:05,375
Once Gurunath met with a girl who would sing at a bar.

63
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:14,458
When Charulatha found this out, she burnt her alive.

64
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,125
After a long search, he found what he was looking for.

65
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,000
Where will I find liquor?
-Next to the market.

66
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,708
Okay.

67
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,250
Sir…You must attend on the
next adjourned date as well.

68
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,583
This judge is a little strict.

69
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,291
Saami!
-Guru?

70
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,833
That is not possible. It must happen as I say.
If anything goes wrong… you know very well about me.

71
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,208
Catch him.

72
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,541
Gurunath, I won't spare you.

73
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,166
What are you doing with a knife at this young age?

74
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,125
I want to kill my father.

75
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,541
Is it?
Okay, alright!

76
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:06,750
Think that I killed him for you.
Where do you want me to drop you off?

77
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,625
There is no particular place.
I can get off wherever you want.

78
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,250
Will you come with me? He will take care of you.

79
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:24,250
If I come with you, you should take care of me.

80
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,500
Saami.
-Guru?

81
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,916
Take care of this kid.
-Okay, Guru.

82
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,166
Since then he grew up with me.

83
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:47,458
I raised a lot of kids but I grew attached
only to this one particular boy.

84
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,250
He wanted to grow closer to Gurunath as well.

85
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:56,791
A few years later, he got that opportunity.

86
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,291
A big consignment of drugs came from Nigeria.

87
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,500
A lot of people wanted to get that on shore.

88
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:08,166
But without Gurunath's permission,
nobody dared to receive those drugs.

89
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,625
Dad, there is a consignment stuck at the south port.

90
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,750
RK has a few contacts over there,
we are planning to get them on shore.

91
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,916
I wanted to inform you.

92
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,958
Dad?
-What is there in the consignment?

93
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,041
300 crores worth of drugs.

94
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,583
If we manage to lay our hands on them,

95
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,083
for the next one whole year
we can supply them in the whole country.

96
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,625
How can we do it without Gurunath's permission?

97
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,500
It will be a great risk to do it without his knowledge.

98
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,708
Dad, if you give your consent,
we can immediately plan to get them.

99
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:58,916
When I got into this business,
I had at least 15 competitors along with me.

100
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:04,041
Out of that, 11 of them died
and the remaining are rotting in jail.

101
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,083
Am I right, Saami?

102
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,416
You are right, Guru.

103
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:11,250
I'm the only one who's been running this race still
and no one has been able to catch up to me yet.

104
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,375
Do you know why?

105
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,833
I'm there too, Guru.

106
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:22,666
Where are you?

107
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:30,166
I sit in front of you on the empire that I built
and you stand in front of me with your hands folded.

108
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,875
Do you know why?

109
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:41,333
Because I'm aware of what I must not do
more than of what I am supposed to do. I know it very well.

110
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,958
Let's get Gurunath killed and get the consignment.

111
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,791
The weapon that you choose
must scare the opponent and not you.

112
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,333
Did you get it?

113
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,500
I get it, dad.

114
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:13,333
I got this news before you.
I know very well what to do with this.

115
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,375
Leave.
-Okay, dad.

116
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,916
You were talking about a boy, weren't you?

117
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:35,250
The boy who saved you at the court. The same boy.

118
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,125
Him?

119
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,125
Fetch him.

120
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,958
What happened, brother?
Is this your first time meeting the boss?

121
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,083
In the event of a conflict,
don't you pee yourself in your pants, okay?

122
00:17:56,666 --> 00:18:00,625
What is that thing that kids wear which holds their pee?

123
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,083
It is called diaper, brother.

124
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,875
Yes, a diaper. Did you wear one?

125
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,125
Are you angry?

126
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,916
This isn't a government job
to get a post on recommendations.

127
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,916
I'm taking you along only because Saami asked me to.

128
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,416
Stay in the car, don't exit.
Do you understand?

129
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,291
They got Gurunath, flee. Run everbody.

130
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,250
Get the car. Get the car started.

131
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,375
Get the car. Get the car started.

132
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,458
You, psycho…

133
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,375
What happened, Gurunath?
Shall I give my final touch?

134
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,791
Don't shoot him. He must not die an easy death.

135
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,583
Hey, who are you?

136
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,750
Why are you silent? Tell me who are you?

137
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,041
Speak up. Speak up.

138
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,541
We've been torturing him since 2 days
but he hasn't spoken a word, sir.

139
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,250
Speak up. Who are you?

140
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:08,291
Look at him, he is scared.

141
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,916
Is he the one? Start the car.

142
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,250
Did you save my father?

143
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,916
Here, drink.

144
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,791
It's a gift, dude. Have it.

145
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,041
Drink it. I say, just drink it.

146
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,125
Michael, leave him.

147
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,833
Leave me.

148
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,041
What are you looking at? What is it?
Wha…What are you looking at?

149
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,541
What is it? What is it?
-Sorry, sir.

150
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:29,041
Bloody irritating hat to top it off.
Remove that. Bloody driver! -Sorry, sir.

151
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,125
Sorry sir.

152
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,500
Look at the road, bloody.

153
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,625
You saved me a second time.
Tell me what do you want?

154
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:06,208
Is he educated?
-Just like you, Guru.

155
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:14,458
Saami, who is taking care of all the North City bars?

156
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,875
RK, Guru.
We were thinking of handing them over to Amarnath.

157
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,583
Are you drunk again?

158
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,958
Get out.
-Dad?

159
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:42,458
Amar?

160
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:47,416
Henceforth you take care of those bars. Be alone.

161
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:55,208
Henceforth, you work for me and only for me.
Understood? Be careful.

162
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,125
This is the place where you are going to stay from today.

163
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,708
Guru won't do this for anyone
until except he likes that person a lot.

164
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,458
"To capture the burning fort"

165
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,916
"War war war"

166
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,750
"To know who is big who is small"

167
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,416
Guru asked me to give you this car.

168
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:42,125
North city bars are the most dangerous of all the bars in
the city.

169
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:46,958
Nobody knows which gang will come there,
and who will kill whom.

170
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:54,583
The most troublesome gangs out of all the gangs are
the Devaraj gang, the Shetty gang, and the Gundu gang

171
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:58,125
because the boss of all three gangs is RK.

172
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,625
Six people were involved in that attack, sir.

173
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,625
The details about five of them are in this file.

174
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,000
We are still searching for the sixth one.

175
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,000
"As enemies gets destroyed .
And as you snatch their life"

176
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,791
"You get only a little chance
Just a little, just a little"

177
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:47,541
"Don't wait for the right time"
"Don't look here and there"

178
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:52,291
"Once you get them finish them
Finish finish finish them"

179
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,833
That day I was stabbed by 6 knives.

180
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:22,833
Out of them, the 4 knives were operated
by these hands that lay in front of you.

181
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,541
Yours is the 5th pair.

182
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:37,000
The lines in these hands led me to all the culprit hands
one after the other except one.

183
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,791
The knife that was stabbed by that
last hand has broken and still resides in my body.

184
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,375
If you tell me about that person,
I'll take away only your hand.

185
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,125
Tell me.

186
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:01,041
Don't. I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.

187
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:02,916
Ratan! Ratan did it.

188
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,083
Ratan!

189
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:17,500
If a Ram decides to headbutt a mountain
because it is proud of its strong horns,

190
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,583
it is bound to lose its head.

191
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:28,083
Since the day Michael took control of the bar,
he started to curb the mobocracy without caring about
anyone.

192
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:42,541
Sorry, Guru. We couldn't find Ratan's whereabouts yet.

193
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,791
I tried my level best.

194
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,583
Where is his daughter?

195
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,458
Leave us, sir

196
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,625
Leave me, sir.
Leave me, sir.

197
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,208
Blow it on my face.

198
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:47,041
Michael, the day I come back will be your death day.
Count your days.

199
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,708
Let's see.

200
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:09,916
Michael, did you beat RK?
Guru wants to meet you. Come fast.

201
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,791
I'll take care of Ratan, dad.

202
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,708
Trust me, dad.

203
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:35,500
No need. I know very well what should be done
and who should be doing it.

204
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,416
You can go.

205
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:43,375
Please listen to me once, dad. I'll take care of it. Please!

206
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,750
No. Don't get involved in this.
-Dad?

207
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:50,083
What!

208
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,041
What? Are you a don?

209
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,416
Don't you have any regards for anyone?

210
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,708
Do you know who RK is?

211
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,916
The one who has been by my
side since I stepped into this business.

212
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:24,000
You would have done the same thing if you were in my place.
I didn't do anything different.

213
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:28,333
If I were in your place, I wouldn't have let him go alive.

214
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,166
I would've killed him.

215
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,333
I called you for another important matter.

216
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:45,375
A knife got broken and got stuck in my body.

217
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,041
I can sense the injury but I don't know
the whereabouts of the person who caused it.

218
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:56,750
But I know where he will come to - to his daughter.

219
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,416
Tell me what I must do, sir.

220
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:04,000
She is in Delhi. Follow her.

221
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,125
If you find him, kill him on the spot without missing a
beat.

222
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:10,041
Kill both of them.

223
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,000
Are you looking for what is written in it?

224
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,958
A man who is a master of all art forms
surrendered himself to a woman.

225
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,875
Shall I tell you a classic example, Michael?

226
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,166
Have you heard about the widow spider?

227
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:49,541
The male and female spider, after they mate with each other,

228
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:55,291
In a way, women do that in every field.

229
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
The only difference is we can't see it.

230
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,458
This is the guy and this is his daughter.

231
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:01,625
No! Yeah.
-Okay. Bye!

232
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,000
Hey, the French drama will be here next week

233
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,041
Yes, it's gong to be incredible

234
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,541
Hey, what is this? Idiots.
Are you gone mad?

235
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,083
She got scared.

236
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,541
Have you gone mad?

237
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,250
Leave it. Are you okay?

238
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,583
He is really something, dude.

239
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,083
You are great, dude.

240
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,750
What did you say?

241
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:17,833
Ma…

242
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,916
What?
-Ma… Mom

243
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:25,500
You should remember her before harassing a girl - Your mom!

244
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,583
You don't have to cry when you are not at fault.

245
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,708
Be careful.

246
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,291
Hello!

247
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,500
Drop me off on your way back.

248
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:35,333
What? What are you scared of?

249
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:37,750
I am not a zombie.

250
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,083
I won't bite you.

251
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:44,625
Come, let's go.

252
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:57,375
To be honest, I must hesitate to get into a stranger's car.

253
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:04,666
But you are not a stranger to me.

254
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:08,541
Do you know me?
-I know you very well.

255
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,750
I know that you have been following me.

256
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:17,791
You have been stalking me since
so many days and now you are here too

257
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,333
Where should I drop you off?

258
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:25,333
What's the hurry?

259
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,125
I am Theera. What's your name?

260
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:32,541
Tell me.

261
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,083
Michael.
-Michael!

262
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,500
Hey, look ahead.
Look at the front.

263
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:51,291
Hey! Where are you looking?
You are looking right at it, man.

264
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,500
Speed breaker.

265
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,166
Oh! Speed breaker?

266
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:04,000
Okay, leave.
It's not your fault.

267
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,583
All men are the same.

268
00:43:09,541 --> 00:43:13,750
Hey, stop, stop. Ice cream.
Ice cream. I'll get some ice cream.

269
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,208
Two vanilla.
-I don't want.

270
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,291
Both are for me. If you want, order for yourself.

271
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,541
Bro, give me two vanilla ice cream.

272
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:33,375
Okay.

273
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,291
How much?
-Twenty rupees.

274
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:41,875
Okay

275
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:44,291
Thank you.

276
00:43:57,041 --> 00:44:01,750
How can you say no to ice cream?
So strange! I don't get it.

277
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:05,791
Will I die if I refuse to eat ice cream?

278
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:10,541
No, I will kill you. For the ice cream.

279
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,291
Laugh, man. It's a joke.

280
00:44:33,791 --> 00:44:34,791
Let's go.

281
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:54,500
You don't have to look into the mirror anymore,
you can stare straight.

282
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:56,708
I won't charge you.

283
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:07,916
But I'm warning you. Don't fall for me,

284
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:09,958
I'll break your heart.

285
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,625
Oh, there, there, there!
You can drop me off on the left side.

286
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:17,833
Yeah, right there.

287
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,250
Thank you for dropping me.

288
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,916
And, one more thing.

289
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:36,000
You looked four times at that place,

290
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,916
but you know, this time it was manly.

291
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:43,208
So, what are you doing tonight?

292
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,291
Come, join me.

293
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:30,333
Live the life to the fullest
As you live happily who doesn't want to?

294
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,458
why greed for land and gold?
Just search for joy in everything

295
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:57,208
You can hide billions
Once greediness leave your life will change

296
00:46:57,416 --> 00:47:03,666
Life is full of dance
Everyone has his own desire

297
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:07,208
Sing and dance and celebrate
This life now

298
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:10,166
No laws, no plans
Enjoying this life is the only desire

299
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:23,375
Live the life to the fullest
As you live happily who doesn't want to?

300
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:09,666
Desire to touch the moon in the sky
Desire to pinch all the hearts in this earth

301
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:16,291
Want to conquer all I see
Once seen want to know what's next

302
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:22,916
Life is a circle, live as you wish
If you see right and wrong then it's a mess

303
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:29,791
Don't think anything there is no inequality
Just forget your worries and dance that's enough

304
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:42,708
Live the life to the fullest
As you live happily who doesn't want to?

305
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,625
I like to slap before I kiss.

306
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,958
Just because I kissed you doesn't mean I love you.

307
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,666
And you are not the only person I'm kissing, okay?

308
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:58,541
No, I was lying.

309
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:07,958
You wanna sleep with me, no?

310
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:14,791
But I don't want to.

311
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,083
You are not my type.

312
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:29,666
But I'm warning you. Don't fall in love with me,
I'll break your heart.

313
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,333
Michael, one help…

314
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:21,000
What happened?

315
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:24,041
I need to go to a place quite urgently.
Will you come along?

316
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,125
To where?
-Come, I'll explain everything in person.

317
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,750
If you find him, kill him.

318
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:44,291
Don't think much. Kill both of them.

319
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:56,958
Where are we heading to?

320
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,833
I'll tell you. Let's get going.

321
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,666
Wait here. I'll be back in 5 minutes. Stay here.

322
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,916
Anything else, madam?
-Nothing for now. I'll order later.

323
00:53:12,916 --> 00:53:13,583
Okay, Madam.

324
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:09,250
Michael! I'm sorry, I made you wait for a long time.

325
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,166
My friend didn't turn up. Come, let's go.

326
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:58,875
Take care. Bye.

327
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:22,750
Michael!

328
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:28,625
Michael! Michael!

329
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,833
Who is that?

330
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,875
Michael! Michael!
-Wait…wait…

331
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:41,791
Michael! Michael, please.
Michael, please stop.

332
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:47,416
Michael, please. Please, Michael.
He is my dad, Michael.

333
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:48,833
I'll tell you everything.

334
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:49,958
Please.

335
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:53,291
Let me explain myself. Please hear me out. Please!
I'll tell you everything.

336
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,958
Please. Please.
He is my dad, Michael.

337
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:00,125
Please, Michael. Please, don't.

338
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:16,541
Please, Michael. Please…

339
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,250
Many people await Gurunath's death.

340
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:12,375
But none of them have enough courage
to declare themselves as his enemies in the open.

341
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:18,833
They wanted to use me and get Gurunath killed.

342
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:23,750
For that, I got a plan from the dark.

343
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:32,166
I thought of executing the plan with newbies
so that no one would be suspicious.

344
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:36,250
But it failed.

345
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,166
Who is responsible for this?

346
00:58:38,291 --> 00:58:39,375
Didn't I tell you that this would be risky?

347
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,583
Don't panic. He didn't find out yet.

348
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:46,500
Before he finds it out let's fall on his feet and ask
forgiveness.

349
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,583
Do you think he will leave us alive?

350
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:55,958
Hello.

351
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,041
Michael didn't kill him, boss.

352
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,416
What shall I do now?

353
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,458
Boss? Boss?

354
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,083
I'll take care of it.
-Okay, boss.

355
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,333
Who is this, idiot? Honk at him.

356
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:09,875
Hey, move side. Move!

357
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,666
Hey, Move aside.

358
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:16,125
Hey, crackpot! Move aside.

359
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:22,875
Who is this, idiot? Overtake him. What are you doing?

360
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:27,458
Move aside or I'm gonna crack your skull.

361
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,375
Wait. I'll go and check.

362
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,958
What?
-You...

363
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,708
Who are you? How dare you hit my brother?

364
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,916
Wait here. I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

365
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,833
-Wait here. I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
-Rahul! Rahul!

366
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:57,458
Hey! Hey!
Rahul! Rahul!

367
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,458
Hey, what are you doing?

368
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:09,541
Are you crazy?

369
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:13,291
Hey, come here. Come!

370
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,416
Do you have matches?

371
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:23,125
Are you gonna burn the car for just honking at you?

372
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,541
Yes, I'll do that.

373
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:30,125
Honk at me again and I'll burn you along with it.

374
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,291
If someone asks who did it,

375
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,541
-tell them that a Tamil guy came and burnt the car.
-Rahul, where are you?

376
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:52,125
My car! My car!
What have you done? My Car!

377
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:54,208
"You're enough for me"
"You're enough for me"

378
01:04:54,208 --> 01:05:00,458
"As long as you live"
"I'll be for you"

379
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,583
Will you come in or not?

380
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:35,458
"In the depths of my mind
You're showering like a rain"

381
01:05:35,458 --> 01:05:46,416
In my shadowy paths
You're walking with me

382
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:58,750
"As we go totogether
All the sky is being coloured."

383
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:10,041
"You are the search that caressed my eyelids
You are the song that stole my music"

384
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:21,666
"You snatched my loneliness in instalments
You are the heartbeat of my life."

385
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:30,666
"You're enough for me"
"You're enough for me"

386
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:36,916
"As long as you live"
"I'll be for you"

387
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:42,625
"You're enough for me"
"You're enough for me"

388
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:49,250
"As long as you live"
"I'll be for you"

389
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:27,208
"Your eyes melt even iron with love"

390
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:32,875
"Forget even grammatical errors with love"

391
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:38,375
"Turn even sand to rock with Love"

392
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:43,875
"Make even the mind lazy with Love"

393
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:46,666
"Throughout the day"

394
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:49,458
"I will be waiting"

395
01:07:49,458 --> 01:07:52,250
"For you"

396
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,041
"Like the waves of the sea"

397
01:07:55,208 --> 01:08:00,875
"On a leaf
As a drop of water"

398
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:06,666
"Let's be together
Like the body and the soul."

399
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:12,750
"You're enough for me"
"You're enough for me"

400
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:19,666
"As long as you live"
"I'll be for you"

401
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,375
Michael!

402
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:24,166
Come, come! Come!
-No

403
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:29,875
Michael!

404
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:41,083
Michael!

405
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,166
Theera!
-Michael!

406
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,250
Michael!

407
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,708
Michael! Michael!

408
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:57,291
Michael! Michael! Michael!

409
01:10:00,250 --> 01:10:03,791
Michael!
-Leave me.

410
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:29,583
Theera! Theera!

411
01:12:30,916 --> 01:12:35,708
Hey, Michael!
Now, do you know who I am? Did you find out?

412
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,458
The day you picked a fight with me,

413
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:42,583
instantly I knew that you would be in this state.

414
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:45,166
But I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

415
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,541
Do you feel sorry for yourself? Do you?

416
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:53,708
Didn't I warn you that the next time
I'll meet you I'm gonna kill you?

417
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:56,916
Where is Theera?

418
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:04,666
Before you see her,
you must meet another important person.

419
01:13:15,708 --> 01:13:17,083
Who is responsible for this?

420
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:22,041
Gurunath's son, Amarnath.

421
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,583
We paid you because you guaranteed us your father's support.

422
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:36,583
I know that, okay?

423
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:42,750
I'll talk to my father. Okay, I'll figure it out.
Trust me. I will sort it out.

424
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:48,500
Listen, man. Sort it out soon or else repay us.

425
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:13,500
He refused 300 crores.
Chuck it, I said let me handle it personally.

426
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:18,708
He is not letting me do that either.
When will I handle my own business?

427
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:24,791
Until he is alive, he won't let me handle any business

428
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:34,041
Let's do one thing, let's kill him.

429
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:44,416
But nobody should find out about my involvement in this.

430
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,291
Okay?

431
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:48,375
Okay?
-Okay.

432
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:54,541
All the information is in this. Done?
-Done.

433
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:00,333
Where is Theera?

434
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:09,541
What is with him?
Why is he chanting her name continuously?

435
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,916
Where is Theera?

436
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:17,666
Where is Theera? Where is Theera?
Where is Theera?

437
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,375
Why do you keep asking the same thing, you moron?

438
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:29,125
Do you love her? Yeah. That's love.

439
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:37,916
Did you betray us up because of her?
Tell me, did you?

440
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:42,375
Listen. We sent you to kill someone because he betrayed us.

441
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,333
But by not killing him you betrayed us. Didn't you?

442
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:51,916
Now, I must kill him.

443
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:55,333
Do whatever you want
but let Theera go.

444
01:15:56,833 --> 01:16:00,416
Did you do all of this for her?
For her?

445
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:04,750
But you are a fool, man. A bloody fool.

446
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:11,458
Don't you trust me? You don't?

447
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:18,000
Wait, let me have her tell this to you directly.

448
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:20,791
Okay?

449
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:24,291
Hey, drag her here.

450
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,458
Guys, get her.

451
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:35,958
Look, look… Do you see her?

452
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:40,125
Look, how she's shedding crocodile
tears after betraying you. Look at her!

453
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,125
Do you see it?
-Michael.

454
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:59,708
Tell him. Come on.

455
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:08,375
Tell him how you cheated him
by pretending to love him. Tell him.

456
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:14,750
Come on, tell him.

457
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,291
What's his name?
-Michael?

458
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:24,083
No, dad. I'll handle everything. No worries.

459
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:36,250
Are you out of mind? Why did you bring him along?

460
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:38,666
I called you here alone. What's happening?

461
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:42,333
Dad, don't worry.
Even if I didn't get him along with me,

462
01:17:42,333 --> 01:17:45,625
he would have followed me anyways.
Now, at least we don't have to face that risk.

463
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:49,125
He will listen to me. He is waiting outside.

464
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:55,375
Michael!

465
01:17:56,416 --> 01:18:01,750
I'm sorry, I made you wait for a long time.
My friend didn't turn up. Come, let's go.

466
01:18:08,291 --> 01:18:13,750
My dad sent you to follow her
and I appointed another person to follow both of you.

467
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:17,083
How can you expect anything less from me? Stupid fellow.

468
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:23,125
Let her go.
-Come. Get up.

469
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,458
Come, dear. Come!

470
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:35,000
My dad controls the whole city with just a glance,

471
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,416
even he couldn't tame him down.

472
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:42,833
But you managed to tame him
between your legs. Good job!

473
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:48,208
Let me give you a gift for your true love.

474
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:51,041
Shoot him! Hold this. Shoot him!

475
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:57,291
Shoot him! Shoot…
Dear? Shoot him. Shoot…

476
01:18:58,208 --> 01:18:59,250
Hey,

477
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:05,541
If you won't shoot him, I'll make his skull burst open.

478
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:09,250
Leave my daughter!

479
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:10,958
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

480
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:14,875
You are responsible for this. Bloody waste!

481
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:19,583
Hey, shoot him. Shoot!

482
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:24,291
Shoot him! Shoot!

483
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:07,833
What was that? You really shot him?

484
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:12,833
Poor thing.

485
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:18,208
I must give you a gift for shooting him down.

486
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,208
Hey, get rid of his body.

487
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:52,791
And get her to a safe place.

488
01:20:55,416 --> 01:20:57,083
I want to taste her too.

489
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:01,916
There's something special in her.

490
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:38,708
But I'm warning you.

491
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:40,708
Don't fall for me,

492
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:43,083
I'll break your heart.

493
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:53,875
Don't fall in love with me, I'll break your heart.

494
01:21:58,875 --> 01:21:59,750
Michael!

495
01:22:15,125 --> 01:22:24,333
Only until we hold the thread of loyalty
and trust can we control the animal tied to it.

496
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:29,875
Once it is cut loose, no one is capable enough
to face the havoc that is to be caused by that beast.

497
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:34,666
Michael, we must kill that middle guy.
You carry out the job and I'll get the vehicle.

498
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:36,458
but he behaves as if he has consumed a full bottle of
liquor.

499
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,625
Do you know what happened yesterday?

500
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,875
What happened?

501
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:46,416
He entered his neighbour's house instead of going into his
own.

502
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:48,666
Is it?

503
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,875
You should have seen his face.

504
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:54,583
Did you get enough thrashing?

505
01:22:55,333 --> 01:22:58,750
He is not sharing with us but I'm sure
he must have gotten a nice thrashing from them.

506
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:02,750
Why are you holding your pants while you walk? Is it
slipping off?

507
01:23:02,833 --> 01:23:06,500
Hey, what's your age?
Are you already smoking at this young age?

508
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,375
Hey, kiddo. Do you want to drink?

509
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:12,916
He is a school-going kid.
Why are you offering him a drink?

510
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:15,000
Bro, school boys and girls are way matured now.

511
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,958
He is scared, master.
He stopped in his tracks.

512
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:27,291
He is not afraid. He is hesitating because he is thinking.

513
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:30,541
Those who speak about ethics and morals are weaklings,

514
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:38,083
those with brawl behave like hooligans
but one with brains behaves like me.

515
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:41,083
Gurunath is someone who has both brain and brawn.

516
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:45,500
It is up to you how you are going to conduct yourself,
Michael.

517
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,500
He stays away from certain things.

518
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,625
But if you throw stones at him since he is staying away,

519
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,125
he is not going to remain calm.

520
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:56,708
He is going to charge at you like a tsunami.

521
01:23:56,708 --> 01:24:01,458
Even God cannot stop the calamity that ensues after that.

522
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:04,166
Michael is that unstoppable tsunami.

523
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:23,708
Death is going to haunt you even if you touch his shadow
but Amar laid his hands on him.

524
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,000
Who gave the authority to do this?

525
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:34,458
How many times have I told you to not get
involved in any of my business?

526
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:48,250
Why do you care so much about him?

527
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:57,041
He betrayed us and I killed him. I killed him.

528
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:01,583
Moreover, who is he, dad?

529
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:08,541
He is just another dog amongst many
other dogs that eat what we feed,

530
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:12,750
do as we order, and survive because of our name and power.

531
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:18,041
He is not just another street dog.
You know nothing about him. You piece of shit.

532
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:23,916
He is a wild beast that hunts in an infinite forest.

533
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:41,958
On that day, while everyone was running
in a pack holding onto their dear lives,

534
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:47,916
one person came past that group.
He alone hunted them all and brought me alive.

535
01:25:55,875 --> 01:25:57,375
He didn't survive.

536
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:00,625
I killed him and buried his dead body too.

537
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:07,708
Did you really burry him? Are you sure?

538
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:11,250
The beast has now tasted the blood,

539
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:17,958
if it has even an ounce of blood remaining in its body,
it will come back to get its prey.

540
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:24,458
It's not that easy to kill him.
Are you really sure about it?

541
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:32,583
He is dead. Trust me, dad.

542
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:48,958
I'm not scared for him.
I'm scared for you.

543
01:26:58,416 --> 01:27:02,041
You can't leave him barely alive,
he must be killed completely.

544
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:07,000
Okay, dad.

545
01:27:07,541 --> 01:27:11,083
Not you, Amar. Our guys will take care of that.
-Dad?

546
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:12,500
Okay, sir.

547
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:14,750
Dad, I'll go along with them.
-No, not you.

548
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:16,000
Dad, please let me go.
-No, not you.

549
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,708
Relax.
Relax.

550
01:27:50,041 --> 01:27:53,875
I started this and I will finish this.

551
01:27:55,166 --> 01:28:03,750
If somebody else tries to interrupt me,
they will be killed as well. Did you get it?

552
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,333
Let's go.

553
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:31,166
[Tamil Film song]

554
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,875
He is not dead yet.

555
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,416
Where is Theera?

556
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:56,791
Michael !

557
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:01,541
Michael !

558
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:06,041
I'm sorry, Michael.

559
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,500
I'm sorry, Michael.

560
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,416
Please forgive me.

561
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:26,583
It's all my fault.
-You are not at fault, Tira. It's not your fault.

562
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:30,458
I cheated you but I had no other option.

563
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:32,958
Boss came.

564
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:36,791
I never wanted to kill you, Michael.

565
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,125
Don't cry, Theera.

566
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:44,416
I was not honest with you, Michael.

567
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:47,125
Bloody, are you still alive?

568
01:29:48,375 --> 01:29:49,750
My dad was right about you.

569
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:52,000
Had I been in your place,
I would have done the same thing, Theera.

570
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:55,833
You are not going to die that easily.

571
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:57,708
Please go away from here, Michael.

572
01:29:57,708 --> 01:30:04,291
We will do everything possible for our loved ones.
You did this for your father.

573
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:11,250
Tira, I want to do something for you.

574
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,541
Do you want her even in your death?

575
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:19,208
Tell me, Theera. What can I do for you?
Tell me, Theera.

576
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:22,708
I'm going to kill both of you. You, rascal!

577
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,541
Tell me, what do you want, Theera?

578
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:37,125
Hey! Hey, hey!

579
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:41,625
Tell me, what do you want, Theera?

580
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:53,916
Are we staging a Romeo and Juliet play here,
that you guys are lost in your romance?

581
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,875
I sent her dad to kill my dad but he couldn't.

582
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,916
Then I sent you to kill her dad but you couldn't either.

583
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:10,750
Tell me what you want, Theera.

584
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:20,875
Now, I have to kill you both. I have to kill you both.
I must have to kill you, bloody.

585
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:24,000
What do you want, Theera?

586
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:25,958
Answer him.

587
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:29,416
Tell me what can I do for you?

588
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,875
Kill this dog. Kill this dog, Michael!

589
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:43,500
Guys, get him. Kill him.

590
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,875
Boss,

591
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:06,791
He must leave this place alive.

592
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:08,416
Boss, he won't be alive for long.

593
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:53,500
Boss, come. Come, let's go. Boss!

594
01:33:56,375 --> 01:33:57,708
Boss, come. Come, let's go. Boss!

595
01:34:00,916 --> 01:34:06,916
Come fast, boss. Come fast.
He will come after us. Come fast, boss.

596
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,875
Boss...

597
01:34:17,291 --> 01:34:22,375
Boss! Boss, don't do that.
Listen to me. Let's get out of here.

598
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:30,833
Boss! Boss, don't do that.
Listen to me. Let's get out of here.

599
01:34:57,791 --> 01:35:05,291
For the first time,
Gurunath's empire was stained by his own blood.

600
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:46,375
Give me two minutes, I'll take it out.

601
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:09,291
The bullet is out. Here!

602
01:36:11,916 --> 01:36:14,916
It's over. Be patient.

603
01:36:17,875 --> 01:36:21,416
It's done, Michael. I've taken the bullet out.

604
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:35,500
Michael…

605
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:41,500
Did he die quailing in pain?

606
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:58,333
Yes.

607
01:36:59,125 --> 01:37:01,083
You shouldn't have done this, Michael.

608
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:05,916
It's time that you repent for saving my life.

609
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:10,875
I'm going to cut you into pieces
and feed you to the stray dogs, you motherfucker!

610
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,083
What happened?
What happened?

611
01:37:19,541 --> 01:37:21,958
Our son is dead.

612
01:37:25,041 --> 01:37:33,666
Michael, you would realise my pain by
the kind of death I'm going to grant you and her.

613
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:53,500
He will kill everyone associated with me until he finds me.

614
01:37:54,625 --> 01:38:00,000
You are the only one who's been with me.
Go away into hiding from some days, master.

615
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:04,000
Don't worry about me. Where will you go?

616
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:39,625
He… He is my only son.

617
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:44,250
The heir to my kingdom.

618
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:47,291
He lies here as a dead man.

619
01:39:49,625 --> 01:40:01,000
Whoever gets me his body,
whoever gets me that Michael's body will be my heir.

620
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:10,791
If anybody comes in his support, kill them too.

621
01:40:58,250 --> 01:41:00,791
Guru, we have searched for him everywhere
and inquired every possible person.

622
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:03,375
But in vain, he is nowhere to be found.

623
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:07,333
We are waiting for a signal from you.

624
01:41:08,625 --> 01:41:12,000
Just say yes, and I will get the whole department on the
field.

625
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,875
We shall find him, shoot him down like a dog,
and throw his body away in Bandra bazaar.

626
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:23,500
What a father goes through when his
grown-up son dies is nothing short of going through hell.

627
01:41:25,291 --> 01:41:28,833
He must face the same agony,
and I should make him experience this hell.

628
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,125
Nobody should get involved in this.

629
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:39,375
Stop counting the heads that are going to fall in the
upcoming days.

630
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:42,875
You must not leave at this late hour…

631
01:41:44,166 --> 01:41:48,208
Sometimes, due to unfavourable circumstances,
the Lion might get weakened

632
01:41:49,166 --> 01:41:51,541
but it never forgets its hunting instincts.

633
01:41:56,375 --> 01:42:02,958
He will find us. He will not spare us once we are found.
He'll come. He will definitely come.

634
01:42:03,166 --> 01:42:07,125
Let him come, brother.
I'll cause chills in his spine by hacking her into pieces.

635
01:42:07,375 --> 01:42:11,625
No, no, no. He will do anything for her.

636
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,458
If we want to have an upper hand over him,
we must keep her alive.

637
01:42:16,708 --> 01:42:18,791
Don't harm her. Don't do any harm to her.

638
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:24,500
Didn't you tell me that Gurunath is a big don?
But he isn't able to kill one person.

639
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:28,750
Brother, we are so many in numbers. We will kill him.

640
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:31,041
Have you ever seen him?

641
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:32,541
I have seen him.

642
01:42:41,708 --> 01:42:43,791
Hey, Das. What happened?

643
01:42:48,833 --> 01:42:53,375
Isn't one person enough to kill him?
Okay, leave it. Can't we both kill him?

644
01:42:53,833 --> 01:43:00,083
Numbers don't matter anymore.
I saw a fury in his blood.

645
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,375
I saw him but only once.

646
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:44,666
They don't know yet that they are tackling a volcano
and it will burn all of them down.

647
01:44:43,333 --> 01:44:46,041
No. Please, don't. Let me go.

648
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:48,750
Don't kill me. Please, no.

649
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,958
Why, Michael? Why did you come back for me?

650
01:45:24,208 --> 01:45:26,458
You almost faced death because of me.

651
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:32,416
Despite knowing that I cheated you,
why did you come for me?

652
01:45:38,416 --> 01:45:42,833
Even if you shoot me another 100 times,
I would still come for you, Theera.

653
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,666
Michael, where shall we go?

654
01:46:16,625 --> 01:46:22,458
Michael! Speak up, Michael.

655
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:20,125
He killed everyone and took the girl away.

656
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:22,625
How many?
-Twelve.

657
01:47:23,666 --> 01:47:25,958
RK?
-Killed as well.

658
01:47:32,083 --> 01:47:35,166
I'm not here to listen to the stories
of his bravado.

659
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,583
I want to hear about his death, that's it..

660
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:42,708
Go and get his dead body to me.
Get losr everyone.

661
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:51,291
If you can't do it, find me someone who can.

662
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:03,708
I don't think I can trust any of you with this job.

663
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:10,958
Or tell me, I will get into the field personally.

664
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:23,166
We will do it, boss.
-What?

665
01:48:23,166 --> 01:48:25,083
We will get him, boss.

666
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:38,208
I don't want to hear anything from you other than
the news of his death.

667
01:48:57,541 --> 01:49:01,666
The phone is ringing, why don't you receive it?

668
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:05,500
Nobody is speaking from the other side. They must be
aphonic.

669
01:49:11,583 --> 01:49:16,291
Did you say hello?
-Yes, I did. So what?

670
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:22,291
Just listening to your simple hi,
people go weak in their knees;

671
01:49:22,291 --> 01:49:26,541
Listening to your seductive hello,
they must have become tongue-tied.

672
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:27,333
What?

673
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,625
Yes. I am the biggest example of that.

674
01:49:32,333 --> 01:49:36,625
What are you staring at?
Learn from my husband about how to romance a girl.

675
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:18,000
Who is it?

676
01:50:19,958 --> 01:50:22,083
What?
-What's the matter?

677
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,208
We have a few unexpected guests.

678
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:28,500
Prepare our special laddoos,

679
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,583
we shall serve them.

680
01:52:09,125 --> 01:52:10,583
He is not going to die so soon.

681
01:52:17,625 --> 01:52:18,625
What's his name?

682
01:52:25,583 --> 01:52:32,833
Feed that girl something.
I have a small job to take care of.

683
01:52:34,166 --> 01:52:39,375
Sobbing like a baby for candy.
Make her stop crying.

684
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:05,791
Brother?

685
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:11,458
I have a few guests coming over,
get me 20 kgs of mutton, 10 kgs of chicken,

686
01:53:11,458 --> 01:53:12,000
Okay

687
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,375
and don't forget about the eggs.
-Okay, brother.

688
01:53:14,791 --> 01:53:16,166
Also, fry the eggs.
-Okay.

689
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:19,083
How long will it take?
-I'll send it in 15 mins, brother.

690
01:53:19,541 --> 01:53:23,875
15 minutes?
Okay. I'm waiting here.

691
01:53:23,875 --> 01:53:24,458
Okay, brother.

692
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,833
Near the Ashok market.
Okay.

693
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:28,375
Come fast.
-Okay, brother.

694
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:53,041
I have packed everything as you ordered, brother.

695
01:53:59,375 --> 01:53:59,958
Brother?

696
01:54:04,958 --> 01:54:06,625
Thank you, brother.

697
01:54:15,958 --> 01:54:17,416
I'll take your leave, brother.

698
01:54:26,083 --> 01:54:27,250
Kanamma!

699
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:52,166
Hey, what is this? Why is this so heavy?
-Did you prepare sweets for the guests?

700
01:54:52,166 --> 01:54:53,208
This is a savoury item.

701
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:26,708
"Someone's on the lookout, not far"
"No matter what the odds are"

702
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:34,291
"No one dare lay a finger, today"
"He's here to guard the whole way"

703
01:56:34,750 --> 01:56:40,000
"Through trouble and through danger, no fear, no worry"

704
01:56:40,166 --> 01:56:43,458
"The coast will always be clear"

705
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:53,375
"He'll save the day, he will find a way,"

706
01:56:53,833 --> 01:57:00,416
"No matter what they say, the end is good today"

707
01:57:06,958 --> 01:57:10,250
"From the shadows, he will rise an angel, he flies"

708
01:57:10,333 --> 01:57:14,208
"Through the fire blazing power, no one denies"

709
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:35,458
Don't you see there's an elder one standing here?

710
01:57:36,166 --> 01:57:38,875
Drop it down. Drop it down, I say.

711
01:57:42,708 --> 01:57:48,958
"A saviour with a heart of pure gold, his fight is brave and
bold"

712
01:57:50,041 --> 01:57:51,583
"Ain't no one's gonna stop him, right now"

713
01:57:51,583 --> 01:57:53,500
Enough?

714
01:57:54,291 --> 01:57:56,750
"He'll push the game and show you how"

715
01:57:57,875 --> 01:58:05,125
"Show them what he's made of,
he'll save the day through it all"

716
01:58:05,833 --> 01:58:09,083
"He won't miss a single thing"

717
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:12,333
"He'll never never let you down"

718
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:24,250
"Nothing's gonna stop this guardian angel,
he'll rise"

719
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:28,000
"Knock your troubles all down,
you know, he will, all right."

720
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:33,958
Hey! Hey! Stay here, we will come back.

721
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:36,541
I'll be here but where are you going?

722
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:38,875
Come, my dear bridegrooms,

723
01:58:39,833 --> 01:58:43,708
I'm going to wash my feet with your blood today.

724
01:58:44,666 --> 01:58:49,291
Come without fail. Come back,
I have a special treat for you.

725
01:58:49,833 --> 01:58:50,750
Come, sir.

726
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:55,125
Come back soon.

727
01:58:57,875 --> 01:58:58,708
Get in.

728
01:59:03,208 --> 01:59:04,041
What?

729
01:59:24,458 --> 01:59:26,416
(Indistinct voices)

730
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:42,166
(Indistinct voices)

731
01:59:48,416 --> 01:59:55,250
"Someone's on the lookout, not far"
"No matter what the odds are"

732
01:59:55,541 --> 02:00:02,833
"No one dare lay a finger, today"
"He's here to guard the whole way"

733
02:00:03,291 --> 02:00:08,541
"Through trouble and through danger, no fear, no worry"

734
02:00:08,708 --> 02:00:12,000
"The coast will always be clear"

735
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:21,916
"He'll save the day, he will find a way,"

736
02:00:22,375 --> 02:00:28,791
"No matter what they say, the end is good today"

737
02:00:29,166 --> 02:00:32,416
Guys, you didn't learn the lesson from the last time.

738
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:35,958
I was just fine, I'm a soft person and a vegetarian too.

739
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:42,041
But my boss is a terror piece.
Save yourself if you can.

740
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,166
Do you want to witness a small sample?

741
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Kanamma!

742
02:01:00,583 --> 02:01:03,875
"From the shadows, he will rise an angel, he flies"

743
02:01:03,958 --> 02:01:07,833
"Through the fire blazing power, no one denies"

744
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:16,916
Green colour.

745
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,625
Okay
-Green colour?

746
02:01:23,916 --> 02:01:26,708
Are you fearing a lady holding a gun? Come, let's go.

747
02:01:28,208 --> 02:01:30,000
Stop there, you scoundrels.

748
02:01:30,125 --> 02:01:32,625
Dear? Do you want a laddoo?
-What is laddoo?

749
02:01:33,791 --> 02:01:35,250
That's a bomb!

750
02:01:36,916 --> 02:01:43,666
"A saviour with a heart of pure gold, his fight is brave and
bold"

751
02:01:44,166 --> 02:01:48,375
"Ain't no one's gonna stop him, right now"

752
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:50,958
"He'll push the game and show you how"

753
02:01:52,083 --> 02:01:59,333
"Show them what he's made of,
he'll save the day through it all"

754
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:02,375
"He won't miss a single thing"
-It's just laddoo. Tasty laddoo.

755
02:02:02,375 --> 02:02:04,041
"He'll never never let you down"
-Take it. It is very tasty.

756
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:10,541
Have it and you can meet the Almighty directly.

757
02:02:10,833 --> 02:02:13,833
Do you want it?
-No! No!

758
02:02:14,166 --> 02:02:16,500
Have it!
-No! No!

759
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:18,916
Kanamma?
-Dear?

760
02:02:19,041 --> 02:02:22,541
Run. Run for your lives.

761
02:02:26,958 --> 02:02:30,208
"Nothing's gonna stop this guardian angel, he'll rise"

762
02:02:30,208 --> 02:02:33,458
"Knock your troubles all down, you know, he will, all
right."

763
02:02:42,125 --> 02:02:46,041
"Nothing's gonna stop this guardian angel, he'll rise"

764
02:02:46,041 --> 02:02:49,958
"Knock your troubles all down, you know, he will, all
right."

765
02:03:06,041 --> 02:03:07,625
Can you do me a favour?

766
02:03:10,416 --> 02:03:11,250
Tell me.

767
02:03:12,083 --> 02:03:16,791
I'll leave. You guys please take care of him.

768
02:03:17,875 --> 02:03:20,625
Do you really care about his well-being?

769
02:03:37,416 --> 02:03:41,000
I will tell you something of my experience. Listen to it.

770
02:03:48,416 --> 02:03:54,833
Guarding the prison and being locked up
in the prison are both the same thing.

771
02:03:56,083 --> 02:03:59,916
I don't know whose ill fate
it was that this kid fell into my prison

772
02:04:02,541 --> 02:04:05,125
I held him as a just-born baby.

773
02:04:07,875 --> 02:04:12,583
I thought I'll raise him under my wings.
We believe that...

774
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:17,958
if we keep something that
we love close to us then it will be safe forever.

775
02:04:18,625 --> 02:04:23,666
But we can't keep fire close to us, can we?
The more we try to douse it, the more it will burn.

776
02:04:33,208 --> 02:04:37,208
The bird that has flown away, might come to
its nest

777
02:04:40,791 --> 02:04:44,208
but it won't come back to its cage.

778
02:04:58,875 --> 02:05:00,875
He thought he didn't have anyone,

779
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:07,750
He left.

780
02:05:10,291 --> 02:05:15,125
Now, you are here for him. Don't leave him as I left.

781
02:05:17,708 --> 02:05:21,333
Hold him tight. He will stay with you.

782
02:06:01,708 --> 02:06:03,125
Michael is missing.

783
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:12,416
Give me a matchbox.

784
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:33,750
(Indistinct voices)

785
02:06:46,125 --> 02:06:48,083
(Indistinct voices)

786
02:10:47,083 --> 02:10:48,458
Come, Michael. Come.

787
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:55,750
I was expecting you much earlier.
You are very late.

788
02:11:00,708 --> 02:11:09,958
I'm not surprised to find out that all this blood spilling was
due to the laughter of a woman but I'm ashamed though.

789
02:11:20,375 --> 02:11:22,958
Remember one thing, Michael.

790
02:11:23,791 --> 02:11:32,750
No woman can love you or me for any noble reason.
She cares about her life and her father's life.

791
02:11:33,208 --> 02:11:38,000
She took a chance by giggling along with you and it paid
off. If not you,

792
02:11:38,500 --> 02:11:43,750
she would have tried it with someone else, if not him,
she would have tried it with me.

793
02:11:44,041 --> 02:11:46,958
Sir, people like us always try to find our mirror image in
society.

794
02:11:48,291 --> 02:11:54,833
We are suffering from a disease called suspicion.
It's not their fault.

795
02:11:54,833 --> 02:11:56,333
Okay, let's say she cheated me.

796
02:11:56,708 --> 02:11:59,333
But compared to our sins, her betrayal is nothing.

797
02:12:00,875 --> 02:12:04,791
God has destined all men to suffer because
of their decision to trust the delusions of women.

798
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:11,875
You are stuck in that same delusion, Michael.
That's your problem, Michael.

799
02:12:13,875 --> 02:12:18,333
When you go back from here,
you would have only my blood left in your hands,

800
02:12:34,666 --> 02:12:36,875
None of us betrayed you, sir.

801
02:12:40,666 --> 02:12:44,916
Your own son, your own blood…

802
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:50,791
Your blood doesn't respect you.
You don't trust your blood.

803
02:13:00,541 --> 02:13:03,958
What are you waiting for? Kill him.

804
02:13:05,083 --> 02:13:09,791
Slash his nerves and spill his blood on my feet.

805
02:13:09,875 --> 02:13:11,166
Charu!

806
02:13:16,166 --> 02:13:18,916
No matter what, he is still my son.

807
02:13:20,625 --> 02:13:22,041
He will be my replica.

808
02:13:24,666 --> 02:13:30,541
I'm his father, do you think I'm unaware of his thoughts and
acts?

809
02:13:32,875 --> 02:13:36,625
At the end of the day, this throne belongs to him after me.

810
02:13:36,625 --> 02:13:44,708
How does it matter if he usurps it or I gift it?

811
02:13:44,708 --> 02:13:45,958
Who are you to intervene?

812
02:13:49,125 --> 02:13:51,291
Don't take any action in haste, sir.

813
02:13:55,833 --> 02:14:02,250
There is no new happiness or greater loss
that you can make me experience.

814
02:15:23,291 --> 02:15:24,375
Michael!

815
02:15:25,333 --> 02:15:27,166
Think about it, Michael.

816
02:15:28,625 --> 02:15:32,625
I sheltered you. I gave you a weapon.

817
02:15:33,333 --> 02:15:36,958
But you stand against me for her.

818
02:15:39,333 --> 02:15:40,875
You want me, right?

819
02:15:42,666 --> 02:15:46,708
Come. Leave her. Let her go.

820
02:15:46,708 --> 02:15:49,958
Shame on you for kneeling before him!

821
02:15:51,875 --> 02:15:54,708
If I don't see him die, I don't care to be alive.

822
02:15:57,333 --> 02:16:02,791
Hey!
-She is a sin, sir!

823
02:16:03,666 --> 02:16:05,875
A sin that must be washed off with blood.

824
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:16,000
I'm not here to kill only you, sir.
My primary target was her.

825
02:16:29,125 --> 02:16:33,375
I treated you as if you were my own. You backstabber!

826
02:16:34,875 --> 02:16:40,083
As your son?

827
02:16:43,416 --> 02:16:49,791
Yes, sir. I did all this for a lady.
Why should a man live if not for a woman?

828
02:16:54,166 --> 02:16:59,250
Why should I wait for 20 years and finally today,
come out and stand against you, to kill you?

829
02:17:00,625 --> 02:17:02,250
For a woman, sir.

830
02:17:03,958 --> 02:17:05,916
But not for the woman you think.

831
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,791
The woman who was betrayed by you.

832
02:17:33,916 --> 02:17:36,291
To kill my father…

833
02:17:41,041 --> 02:17:44,125
Who is your father? Tell me... Tell me.

834
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:46,625
Gurunath!

835
02:17:52,791 --> 02:17:55,125
Are you Jenifer's son?

836
02:18:10,333 --> 02:18:11,625
Sir?

837
02:18:13,958 --> 02:18:15,125
Who is that girl?

838
02:18:16,041 --> 02:18:20,625
She is the new singer who joined our bar, sir.
She sings well and plays the violin too.

839
02:18:20,666 --> 02:18:23,208
She is the main reason for the popularity of our bar, sir.

840
02:18:29,041 --> 02:18:36,875
Jenifer became close to Gurunath.

841
02:18:36,875 --> 02:18:42,041
Gurunath hid about his marriage
and started to roam along with her.

842
02:18:42,041 --> 02:18:43,791
You are looking so beautiful.

843
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,375
Jenifer trusted Gurunath.

844
02:18:57,208 --> 02:19:02,541
Jenifer got pregnant because of Gurunath.

845
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:08,750
Later, Jenifer found out the truth about Gurunath's first marriage
and Charulatha found out about Jenifer's pregnancy.

846
02:19:08,916 --> 02:19:14,958
When Gurunath found this out,
he started ignoring Jenifer

847
02:19:17,833 --> 02:19:20,250
He threatened her to get you aborted.

848
02:19:21,208 --> 02:19:26,791
I can't stay with you.
How many times have I told you to abort it?

849
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:34,333
You should have thought about that before sleeping with me.

850
02:19:37,458 --> 02:19:42,166
You cheated me and now,
there's no point in behaving as if you are the

851
02:19:42,166 --> 02:19:45,041
You will be dead. Go.

852
02:20:01,958 --> 02:20:02,791
Hello?

853
02:20:03,666 --> 02:20:08,291
I know that you are with her, Guru.
Come out as soon as possible..

854
02:20:09,416 --> 02:20:13,791
otherwise, you are going to die along with her.

855
02:20:15,541 --> 02:20:17,416
Come out, Guru. I know you very well.

856
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,708
Choose one between her and me,
now. Come out immediately.

857
02:20:33,166 --> 02:20:35,375
Sleep with you whoever you want to,

858
02:20:35,750 --> 02:20:41,583
but your heir should be only one,
the one which I give birth to.

859
02:20:42,916 --> 02:20:47,833
While Jenifer was still in the house,
Charulatha ignited the whole house.

860
02:20:53,041 --> 02:20:55,541
Jenifer somehow managed to escape from there.

861
02:20:56,125 --> 02:21:00,458
She managed to reach her father's friends' house
with all the burnt injuries.

862
02:21:04,041 --> 02:21:07,458
I am Jenifer. I need your help.

863
02:21:23,208 --> 02:21:29,250
Until I give birth to my child,
I need a shelter where I can stay safe.

864
02:21:40,625 --> 02:21:45,250
This was her punishment that
she sentenced herself for trusting Gurunath.

865
02:21:47,041 --> 02:21:49,541
she never thought of escaping from this cage.

866
02:21:50,666 --> 02:21:52,708
She gave birth to her child in that cage.

867
02:21:57,583 --> 02:22:02,625
Do you remember, I told you about a child
that was born in jail and raised in jail?

868
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:05,083
He is Michael.

869
02:22:24,416 --> 02:22:27,125
He stayed there until he turned 13.

870
02:22:28,375 --> 02:22:30,791
He should have turned into ashes inside his mother's womb.

871
02:22:33,208 --> 02:22:39,458
He not only was born, but he also survived,
and he grew up too with the sole intention of avenging
Gurunath.

872
02:22:41,291 --> 02:22:45,875
Listen to me carefully, Michael.
Always remember what your mother said to you, Michael.

873
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:55,708
Those who are responsible for this, find them,
stand in front of them while out-powering them

874
02:22:57,666 --> 02:23:01,000
and then reveal your identity that you are my son!
That you are Jenifer's son.

875
02:23:01,333 --> 02:23:05,125
Michael's every action was motivated with
an intention of getting close to Gurunath.

876
02:23:09,375 --> 02:23:15,166
That means Gurunath and Charulatha
burned your mother, did they?

877
02:23:19,416 --> 02:23:27,625
He has no other desires other than to avenge
Gurunath's betrayal to his mother.

878
02:23:29,375 --> 02:23:33,916
With you entering his life, for the first time in his life,
he wants to live for himself.

879
02:24:00,208 --> 02:24:02,333
He would have done the same thing even
if you were not part of his life.

880
02:24:02,583 --> 02:24:04,625
The only difference is you have sped up the proceedings.

881
02:24:05,833 --> 02:24:09,333
I feel the pain when you get injured, son.

882
02:24:09,958 --> 02:24:12,041
Why did you do this, Michael?

883
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,875
I'm hurt because of this, mom.

884
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:26,750
I didn't save you coincidentally, dear.

885
02:24:30,125 --> 02:24:33,166
Forget about me, where will you go?

886
02:24:46,875 --> 02:24:49,958
He brought you to me so that he could save you.

887
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:15,041
Then why did you save Gurunath?

888
02:25:19,041 --> 02:25:21,625
He must die in my hands, master.

889
02:25:22,916 --> 02:25:27,583
I must destroy all his strength and his army,
and when he is helplessly alone,at that time I would tell
him…

890
02:25:29,625 --> 02:25:31,458
I would tell him who I am.

891
02:25:32,708 --> 02:25:35,791
I must tell him that I am the same Jenifer's son
whom he betrayed and got killed.

892
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:47,250
Can't you forgive him?

893
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:55,541
What will you do if you were in my place, master?

894
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,333
I didn't have the answer to his question.

895
02:25:59,125 --> 02:26:00,875
That's why I gave him what he wanted.

896
02:26:01,666 --> 02:26:04,333
He left in search of answers to his mother's tragedy.
He won't come back without answers.

897
02:26:16,541 --> 02:26:20,416
You have to see it from my perspective, Michael.
The truth is very different from what you perceive.

898
02:26:22,833 --> 02:26:24,791
You are anyway going to take my place, aren't you?
Look for yourself.

899
02:26:26,375 --> 02:26:31,166
Once you sit on this,
you lose your moral judgement, Michael.

900
02:26:39,541 --> 02:26:46,333
When somebody like you stands in front of me
and points out my mistake,

901
02:26:48,625 --> 02:26:53,250
that means my time has come.

902
02:26:59,166 --> 02:27:01,958
You're my end, Michael. You are my end.

903
02:27:25,375 --> 02:27:31,375
Didn't I tell you, Michael? That in the end
you'd have only my blood in your hands and nothing else.

904
02:27:32,333 --> 02:27:41,166
It's okay, sir. If your blood washes away all my sin, so be
it.

905
02:27:43,208 --> 02:27:45,375
Didn't you betray Gurunath too?

906
02:27:48,166 --> 02:27:56,625
Compared to the betrayal Gurunath did to Jenifer,
my betrayal stands no ground at all.

907
02:27:56,625 --> 02:27:59,583
Those who forgive are God, Michael.

908
02:28:01,541 --> 02:28:05,541
I don't want to become God, mom.
I just want to be a human.

909
02:28:06,458 --> 02:28:10,583
I am not God. I can't forgive you ever.

910
02:29:12,458 --> 02:29:18,125
Didn't I tell you, Michael? That in the end you'd have
only my blood on your hands and nothing else.

911
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:46,875
I don't know who you are but remember one thing,

912
02:29:48,208 --> 02:29:52,291
It took 10 years for Michael to touch Gurunath.

913
02:29:53,583 --> 02:30:00,375
Now, it will take you ages to touch even Michael's shadow.

914
02:30:01,250 --> 02:30:06,416
Just because he killed Gurunath does that
make him a big don? Huh? Is he a don?

915
02:30:08,291 --> 02:30:11,250
Swami will inform us about his wherabouts before this
evening.

916
02:30:11,708 --> 02:30:18,125
Once we find that… let him be any corner of the city,
we shall drag him out and kill him.

917
02:30:18,625 --> 02:30:22,083
We will kill him!

918
02:31:06,625 --> 02:31:13,541
You know me very well.
Inform Michael that soon I'm gonna find him and kill him.

919
02:32:02,625 --> 02:32:04,875
All the scrap in the city has gathered at one place, is it?

920
02:32:09,625 --> 02:32:13,541
I know that you are looking for me...
So, I came to say hello...

921
02:32:20,916 --> 02:32:22,500
I have an open offer for all of you...

922
02:32:24,375 --> 02:32:31,916
Whoever takes this lock from my hand,
gets this city....

923
02:32:33,833 --> 02:32:34,666
Come on!
