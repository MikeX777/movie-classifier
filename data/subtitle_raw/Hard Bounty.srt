(MultiCom Jingle)

00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,902
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:16,789
(gasping)

4
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,289
(gun banging)

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,370
(spurs clanking)

6
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:32,007
- Get up.

7
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,020
I said get up.

8
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:43,281
- What are you, a law man?

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,613
- Nope.

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,810
- He's mine, Kanning.

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,810
- I don't think so.

12
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:21,860
(rooster crowing)

13
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,140
- Maybe we can all share, huh?

14
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:47,010
- This has been a long
time coming, Kanning.

15
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:59,735
(upbeat western music)

16
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,981
(guns banging)

17
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:46,432
(spits)

18
00:02:56,224 --> 00:03:00,557
- You're the one they call
The Holy Ghost, ain't ya?

19
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,240
(horse neighing)

20
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,740
(light music)

21
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,323
(thunder booming)

22
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:35,790
- Who's there?

23
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,991
(horse neighing)

24
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,542
Who's out there?

25
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,329
(dramatic music)

26
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,150
- Mr. Bartell was disappointed to hear

27
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,450
you turned down his offer.

28
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,466
- I ain't got no gun.

29
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,447
- I always like to make it a fair fight.

30
00:06:36,447 --> 00:06:38,697
(thudding)

31
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:50,197

(horse trotting)

33
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,240
- Kanning, back early.

34
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,240
$2,000, right?

35
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:14,722
Let's go.

36
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,672
(upbeat music)

37
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,013
(people talking over each other)

38
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,877
- You must be quite near a
rich man by now, Kanning.

39
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,300
- You'd think so, wouldn't ya?

40
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,950
If I didn't spend half of
everything I made in here.

41
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,370
- You lookin' for company?

42
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,733
- Donnie here?

43
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,290
- Well no, she's busy right
now, but here's Glory.

44
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,613
- I'll pass.

45
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:25,316
It's nothin' personal.

46
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,741
(moaning)

47
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,585
(knocking)

48
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:44,335
- [Man] Go away, this ain't your room.

49
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,980
- Donny, Kanning's back.

50
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,820
- Okay Cowboy, your time's up.

51
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,580
- [Man] Hey, I ain't finished yet.

52
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,510
- You are now.

53
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,360
- Dammit Donnie that ain't
fair, I was just about there.

54
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,370
- You were finished 10 minutes ago,

55
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,200
you were just pretending.

56
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,310
- Well hell for two bucks if
I wanna pretend I got a right.

57
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,770
- If you wanna pretend,

58
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,160
go home and pretend with your wife, okay?

59
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,290
- Jesus, Donnie, I'd have to
pretend I was in another state.

60
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,150
- Well maybe if you took
a bath once in a while

61
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,960
she wouldn't make you sleep in the barn.

62
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,460
- Hey, I pay good money to come up here.

63
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,440
I don't need the insults.

64
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,490
- That'll be two bucks,
the insults are free.

65
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,290
- I ain't gonna pay it.

66
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,840
There's no reason why I should.

67
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,040
- I can think of two real good reasons

68
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,740
why you should pay up and get out.

69
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,548
Thank you.

70
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,215
Thank you very much.

71
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:46,407
(door slamming)

72
00:10:46,407 --> 00:10:48,420
- You got no respect!

73
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,320
I paid good money.

74
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,050
I don't have to take that kind of crap.

75
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,310
You know one of these days one

76
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,160
of them whores is gonna go too far...

77
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,170
- Hi, Cowboy.

78
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,420
(groaning)

79
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,043
Are you ready?

80
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:39,047
(whip snapping)
(man screaming)

81
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,750
(knocking)

82
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,583
- Come in.

83
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:02,626
Hello, Martin.

84
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,833
- Hello, Donnie.

85
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,680
- You've been gone almost a month.

86
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,210
- Seems like two.

87
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,390
- Did you get what you were after?

88
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:23,977
- I guess you could say that.

89
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,927
Can't say that it was worth it, though.

90
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,663
Pull.

91
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,980
I think I'm gettin' to old for this.

92
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,830
- Maybe the bad guys are
just getting younger?

93
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,900
- Younger, faster, smarter, meaner.

94
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,710
- You just need some time off.

95
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,690
- I think I need to retire.

96
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,830
- Oh right, what are you gonna do,

97
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,740
raise chickens, farm pigs?

98
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,700
You couldn't say put for longer
than a week and you know it.

99
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:58,721
- I don't know, Donnie,

100
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,670
got a lot of parts on me ain't
working' like they used to.

101
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,389
- I don't know.

102
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,529
The only part I'm interested

103
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,279
in seems to be workin' just fine.

104
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:22,969
(horses trotting)

105
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,310
- Oh!

106
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,990
Just the way I like it Cowboy, oh yes!

107
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,218
Oh, more, that's it.

108
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,051
That's it, yes!

109
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,440
Yeah!

110
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,240
- You sure do look pretty Miss Jess.

111
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,443
- Why thank you, Willy.

112
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,770
Are you all set?

113
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:51,595
- Yeah.

114
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,530
- You think you can handle it?

115
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,716
That'll be $2.

116
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,009
- It's so damn hot I wish it would rain.

117
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,790
- They sure ain't wastin'
any time hangin' Mawbry.

118
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,610
- No sense is prolonging the agony.

119
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,580
What do you suppose it is makes people

120
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,190
wanna watch another man hang?

121
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,650
- Couldn't tell you.

122
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,480
- They seem really sure that the sucker

123
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,030
judge is gonna find him guilty.

124
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:55,910
- Well if he wasn't guilty,
I wouldn't of brought him in.

125
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:58,780
- Have you ever been wrong?

126
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:04,250
- Well if I was, I don't
wanna know about it.

127
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,050
- These came in last week.

128
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,883
Take your pick.

129
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,500
- What the hell this boy do

130
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,400
to get a $10,000 price tag on his head?

131
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,290
- Kidnapped and murdered
some ranchers daughter.

132
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,810
He put up the reward himself.

133
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,760
- They sure he did it?

134
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,640
- Couple of eye witnesses.

135
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,640
He was seen two days ago heading
this way out of Santa Cruz.

136
00:15:58,709 --> 00:15:59,959
- I'll be back.

137
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,583
(horse neighing)

138
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:19,489
(horse trotting)

139
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:26,055
(light western music)

140
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:50,525
(door creaking)

141
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,680
- Well Mr. Bartell, except
for the men, everybody's gone.

142
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,330
The town's yours.

143
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,740
- And the Willow Mine?

144
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,090
- Your boy needed some persuading.

145
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,640
- Well, well, that is
real good work, Carver.

146
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,200
Here's what I want you to do,

147
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,530
you take the next train
to No Trees and I want you

148
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,240
to file this at the
land office there before

149
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,390
anybody gets a chance
to ask any questions.

150
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,649
- Well, aren't you forgettin' something?

151
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:53,820
- What's that?

152
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,160
- Persuading is extra.

153
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,113
- Well,

154
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,660
just so long as your negotiating tactics

155
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,960
don't land me at the
short end of a long rope.

156
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,750
Oh and Carver, one more little thing.

157
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,593
- What's that?

158
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:36,040
(sighs)

159
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,750
- Remember who pays your salary.

160
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,580
- Good day Mr. Bartell.

161
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:03,062
(spurs rattling)

162
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:44,102
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

163
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:46,402
I don't like to shoot
anybody I don't have to.

164
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,120
Especially so early in the morning.

165
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,670
You Bradly Hope?

166
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,410
- Are you a law man?

167
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,863
- Nope.

168
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,667
- I didn't kill anybody.

169
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,417
(dramatic music)

170
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:15,780
- Well, if I don't have to
shoot you before I get you back,

171
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,204
you can tell it to the judge.

172
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,813
(gun banging)

173
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:24,646
- No!

174
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:47,802
(light music)

175
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,728
- You got a family?

176
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:15,561
- No, sir.

177
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,440
Her Daddy didn't want us
to get married is all.

178
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,822
I didn't hurt her.

179
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,863
I swear.

180
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,527
(train roaring)

181
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:30,361
(squeaking)

182
00:22:38,697 --> 00:22:41,447
(dramatic music)

183
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,690
- A little out of your
territory aren't you Mr. Carver?

184
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:11,420
- Well Sheriff, I'm in a new line of work.

185
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,540
Regulator for Bartell Mining.

186
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,650
- Oh, and what kind of business

187
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,100
would Bartell have in these parts?

188
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,180
- Big business.

189
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,170
The kind that makes a lot of money.

190
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:26,690
- Well this is a quiet town,
I'd like to keep it that way.

191
00:23:28,828 --> 00:23:31,078
(laughing)

192
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,340
- I'm a respectable business man, Sheriff.

193
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,240
Don't worry, you won't have to sober up.

194
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:45,540
(upbeat music)

195
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,240
- Rachel, I know you took 'em.

196
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,010
I know you took my earrings,
now give them back to me.

197
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,440
- I didn't take nothing of yours.

198
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,050
You don't have nothing I want.

199
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,030
- Rachel you are the only
one who knew where they were.

200
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,640
- Maybe you misplaced them.

201
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,420
- I did not misplace them.

202
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,940
- What's going on here, girls?

203
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,560
- She stole my earrings.

204
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,700
- I did not.

205
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,090
- Is that true, Rachel.

206
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,480
- She's always in my belongings,

207
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
she always takes things
that don't belong to her.

208
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,410
- Maybe they just fallen behind something.

209
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,480
- See.

210
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,864
- Rachel, I'm sick of you!

211
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:16,697
- Ow!
- I want my earrings!

212
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:19,069
(yelling over each other)

213
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:19,902
- Now, now.

214
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:20,735
(bell ringing)

215
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:21,568
Hey, hey hey.

216
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:23,350
- Ow.
- Ow, get off me, cow!

217
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,760
- Now you got two seconds to
shut up and get back to work.

218
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,700
- Silly old blonde cow.

219
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,400
- I want my earrings back, Rachel.

220
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,300
- I swear with all the constant
bickering and complaining

221
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,200
it's a wonder a customer gets
serviced around here at all.

222
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,880
- You took those earrings
didn't you, Rachel?

223
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,680
Come one, give them to me.

224
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,100
I said give them to me.

225
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,123
Come on.

226
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,630
What's the matter with you, Rachel?

227
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,470
Why do you do things like this?

228
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:01,345
- I couldn't help it,
Donnie, they were pretty.

229
00:25:01,345 --> 00:25:03,310
I wanted them.

230
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,930
- You can't keep taking things
that don't belong to you.

231
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,870
Do you understand?

232
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:11,584
Rachel.

233
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:17,648
(light music)

234
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,838
- [Rachel] Oh, Donnie.

235
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,088
It's beautiful.

236
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,080
- It was mothers.

237
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,750
Please don't lose this.

238
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,850
It's all we have to remember her by, okay?

239
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:48,325
- I won't.

240
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:50,117
I promise.

241
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:52,194
- Okay.

242
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,590
- She wouldn't have liked
it much here, would she?

243
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,423
- No.

244
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,883
- I miss her.

245
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,161
- I know you do.

246
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,750
You're so beautiful, you're just like her.

247
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:08,486
Come here.

248
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:14,068
(horse neighing)

249
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:20,587
- [Woman] Get out, whores!

250
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:22,054
(bottle shattering)

251
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:23,570
(fire crackling)

252
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,987
- Donnie, Donnie!

253
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:28,456
Donnie, somebody help me!

254
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,044
Donnie!

255
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:31,377
Someone help me!

256
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,702
Help me, someone!

257
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:38,107
- Oh, my God, get some water!

258
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:38,940
- Help!

259
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,002
Donnie, help!

260
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:45,378
- Jesus.

261
00:26:47,018 --> 00:26:49,708
You don't drag 'em in, you know.

262
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:50,541
Let's go.

263
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:58,240
Don't worry it's just
somebody else's husband

264
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,220
had a better time here than
they have at home, okay?

265
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,180
- Honey it ain't about you.

266
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,880
- It coulda been my window
just as easy as yours.

267
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,570
Glory, I'm sorry about everything.

268
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,880
- What the hell is goin' on up here?

269
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,680
- Well as usual, you're
about five minutes too late.

270
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,260
- Just get it cleaned up, okay?

271
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,120
Don't make a meal out of it.

272
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,440
- Maybe we should just leave, Donnie.

273
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,410
Just move on to another town

274
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,520
or maybe even California.

275
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,514
They found nothing but gold and--

276
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:37,100
- Sweetheart, it's not just about

277
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,250
this town or that angry wife.

278
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,700
No matter where we go,
it's gonna be the same.

279
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,770
- So what are we gonna do?

280
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,940
- Remember when Rachel had the fever,

281
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,270
or Jess got that snake bite?

282
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,270
What did we do then?

283
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,810
We all pulled together.

284
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,110
That's what we're gonna have to do now.

285
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,473
We're gonna pull together
and hold our heads up high.

286
00:27:58,473 --> 00:27:59,306
- Okay.

287
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,116
- We can save our money
and maybe buy some land.

288
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,620
- Yeah, somewhere where nobody knows us.

289
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,610
And we could be respectable ladies.

290
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,520
Maybe even get married.

291
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,930
- I've seen the way Harper looks at you.

292
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,230
I think he's sweet on you.

293
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:19,918
(gasps)

294
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,830
- Oh, get out, Donnie.

295
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,630
- Mr. and Mrs. T-bone Harper.

296
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,940
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?

297
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,834
Okay?

298
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:31,570
- Okay.
- Okay, you're okay now.

299
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,403
(horses trotting)

300
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,700
- I've never seen him come
back empty handed before.

301
00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:50,486
(horse neighing)

302
00:28:51,627 --> 00:28:54,377
(dramatic music)

303
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:34,862
(bottle shattering)
(screaming)

304
00:29:37,436 --> 00:29:39,936
(gun banging)

305
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:12,053
Show's over.

306
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:12,970
- Let's go.

307
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:19,680
(people talking over each other)

308
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:32,182
(banging)

309
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,910
- Jesus, Martin, what are you doing?

310
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,743
- Get lost.

311
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,500
I said get lost.
- Martin.

312
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,540
Stop it.

313
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,130
Martin, stop it, you're hurting me.

314
00:30:53,243 --> 00:30:54,872
What happened?

315
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,039
- I was wrong.

316
00:30:57,152 --> 00:30:58,569
I was dead wrong.

317
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:02,903
(moaning)

318
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,340
- Your time's up, put
your money on the table.

319
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:14,970
- What are you talking about?

320
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,803
- You heard me.

321
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,060
If you're gonna treat me like a whore,

322
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,215
then you're gonna pay me like a whore.

323
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:22,048
- Look, Donnie.

324
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,580
- You're the reason I stayed
in this dust drenched town.

325
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,950
Rachel and I shoulda moved
back east a long time ago.

326
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,900
Do you have any idea what it's
like to walk down the street

327
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,850
and have the women talk behind your back?

328
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,220
And the men turn their heads?

329
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,580
Even the ones you were
with the night before.

330
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:45,873
- Donnie, I'm sorry.

331
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:48,934
- You're sorry?

332
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:53,576
That's a first.

333
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,470
- You remember you asked me one time,

334
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,310
how I live with myself?

335
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,263
Do you remember?

336
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,580
Live with what I do.

337
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,980
- Martin you just shutdown.

338
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,570
You shut everybody and
everything around you out.

339
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,673
- That's right.

340
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,460
Well I can't do that anymore.

341
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:31,359
(horses neighing)

342
00:32:42,373 --> 00:32:45,040
(door slamming)

343
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,790
Come here.
- Right away.

344
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
May I help you, sir?

345
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,970
- I wanna cash these in.

346
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,720
- Ah, there's 22,000 of vouchers here.

347
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,553
- That's right.

348
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,640
Those are federal pay
vouchers, I wanna collect.

349
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,780
- They're perfectly legal.

350
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,230
The problem is we don't have that

351
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,920
kind of cash on hand right now.

352
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,300
I'll have to send to
the Federal Reserve Bank

353
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,350
in San Antonio for the funds.

354
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,743
- How long?

355
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:31,330
- Oh, two or three weeks, give or take.

356
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,703
- How long?

357
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,580
- Two weeks, give or take.

358
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,310
- What have you got in the safe?

359
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:49,700
- $10,000 in cash, some security notes,

360
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,210
and the mortgage on the saloon, sir.

361
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,340
- That's it?

362
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,550
- I'm afraid so, sir.

363
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,530
I could let you hold the
mortgage as collateral.

364
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,650
- I got a better idea.

365
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,740
- What are you doing up so early?

366
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,413
Hm?

367
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,150
- I need to see Harper.

368
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,230
- You need to see Harper?

369
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,840
No, you need a bath and
some shaving rather.

370
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,720
He's not here yet, and the bar's not open.

371
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,660
- It is now.

372
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,470
I own the place.

373
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,890
- You own the place?

374
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,890
What does that mean?

375
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:57,360
- It means I'm in a new line of work.

376
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,010
- Oh yeah, what do you know
about running a business?

377
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,923
Huh?

378
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:05,667
- Nothing.

379
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:14,720
- Well I guess he'll make
up for it in personality.

380
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:19,751
(light music)

381
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:27,070
- That'll be two bits for the bath.

382
00:35:28,986 --> 00:35:29,830
- Two bits?

383
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,527
- You may own the place, but the bath,

384
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:34,877
just like the rest of
the services aren't free.

385
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,075
- [Kanning] Put it on my bill.

386
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,334
- [Donnie] Oh, Martin.

387
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:43,584
(laughing)

388
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,660
So, Mr. Proprietor, are you
ready for Saturday night?

389
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,610
- What do you mean?

390
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,080
- Oh I can tell what kind of
saloon owner you're gonna be.

391
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:01,490
- What's the big deal?

392
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,490
Harper sells the whiskey and you ladies.

393
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,010
Well, you sell what you sell.

394
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,890
- And who do you think does

395
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,140
the ordering for this whole downstairs?

396
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,260
Or gets the clean sheets for the beds?

397
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,810
Or the hot water for the baths?

398
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,160
Who do you think does that?

399
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,120
- You do all that, don't you Donnie.

400
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,750
- No, Harper's been doing that.

401
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,880
He's been filling in.

402
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,290
Now it's your job.

403
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,870
- Well, I better get right to it.

404
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,750
- I almost forgot.

405
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,000
Some of the boys came down
from Lazy Eye earlier.

406
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,320
One of them pulled Jess in your room,

407
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,910
I hope you don't mind.

408
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,110
You know how spontaneous
those boys can get.

409
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,070
- You sure look pretty tonight Miss Jess.

410
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,613
- You know you're my favorite, Willy.

411
00:37:02,613 --> 00:37:05,113
(light music)

412
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:30,964
- Damn, Jess.

413
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,410
I wish my wife could do that.

414
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:48,440
- That'll be $2.

415
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,512
(horses trotting)

416
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,110
- You gentlemen check out the bank.

417
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,970
I'll be in the saloon.

418
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:26,915
(spurs rattling)

419
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:31,942
(people talking over each other)

420
00:39:44,106 --> 00:39:47,270
- Hi, you lookin' for some company?

421
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,820
- I'm lookin' for a card game right now,

422
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,820
but don't go nowhere darlin',

423
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,110
'cause I'll be lookin'
to spend my good fortune.

424
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:58,963
Deal me in.

425
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:15,197
(laughing)

426
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,940
- You're having an unbelievable
streak of luck, Cowboy.

427
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,290
- Must be my lucky night.

428
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,920
Get us a bottle, darlin'.

429
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,670
Least I can do is buy
these losers a drink.

430
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:37,483
- Glory.

431
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,249
Go on upstairs.

432
00:40:41,249 --> 00:40:42,082
- What?

433
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:45,850
- I said, go on upstairs.

434
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,604
- What the hell is
wrong with you, Kanning?

435
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:49,604
I ain't had a decent customer all night.

436
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,199
Shit.

437
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:10,440
(chuckling)

438
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,320
- Full house.

439
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,470
- Last time I checked there were

440
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,520
only 52 cards in a deck, Cowboy.

441
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,150
- You just made a mistake, Mister.

442
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,593
Get up.

443
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:28,100
- I've got no gun.

444
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,960
- I don't care, I said get up.

445
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:35,999
- Keep your seat, Sam.

446
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:38,916
- This ain't none of your business.

447
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,202
- It's too late.

448
00:41:48,087 --> 00:41:48,920
- Call it.

449
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:54,240
- Harper, the bell.

450
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,193
On three.

451
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:07,586
(bell ringing)

452
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:30,262
(gun banging)

453
00:42:46,951 --> 00:42:48,951
- I always like to make it a fair fight.

454
00:42:54,563 --> 00:42:57,670
(booming)
(muffled screaming)

455
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,170
(gun banging)

456
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,790
You should watch your back, Kanning.

457
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:33,417
- Never had any reason to, 'til now.

458
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,737
- What the hell happened?

459
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:46,037
- Well, I'm sure they're
wanted for somethin'.

460
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:48,670
- You know I think I
liked it better, Kanning,

461
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,850
when you went out lookin' for them.

462
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,400
All right, let's clean this up.

463
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,510
I need to have a word with
you in private, Mr. Carver.

464
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,750
- Whatever you say, Sheriff.

465
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:17,310
- This round's on the house.

466
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,840
- You wanted to see me Sheriff?

467
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:23,163
- Yeah.

468
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,150
You've had plenty of time to
finish up your business here,

469
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,600
it's time you were movin' on.

470
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:33,693
- Well I don't know, Sheriff,

471
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,680
maybe I got some new
business to attend to.

472
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,420
- And what would that be.

473
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,150
- I'm not rightly sure yet.

474
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,160
- This is a peaceful town.

475
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Suddenly you show up and
I got dead men everywhere.

476
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,350
- I reckon you oughta
thank me for that, Sheriff.

477
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,720
Justice is served.

478
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,333
- Carver.

479
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,270
You ain't a law man anymore.

480
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,110
- I took care of things for ya.

481
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:11,360
So you can go on and crawl
back in the bottle of hooch.

482
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,490
I think I'm gonna stick around in case

483
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,500
there's anything else
I need to take care of.

484
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,450
You never were much of a law man.

485
00:45:27,313 --> 00:45:30,828
(horses trotting)

486
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,172
- How much did I make?

487
00:45:32,172 --> 00:45:33,558
- Not nearly as much as you could have

488
00:45:33,558 --> 00:45:35,258
if you keep your mind on business.

489
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,200
- Where are you going?

490
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,060
- I gotta see the Sheriff.

491
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,893
- What's wrong?

492
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:41,880
Damn you, Kanning.

493
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,660
You're just like all
the rest, you know that?

494
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:59,561
(clicking)

495
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:13,115
- A little edgy, aren't ya?

496
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,790
You know Bartell Mining pays real good.

497
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,900
I could always use another gun hand.

498
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,420
- I think one lackey's enough, don't you?

499
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,810
- I guess those whores must keep you

500
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:29,150
pretty warm at night, huh Kanning?

501
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,700
- Thanks for coming.

502
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,800
What do you know about Randall Carver

503
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,880
and the Bartell Mining Corporation?

504
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:31,290
- I know Bartell's got a lot
of money, owns a lot of people.

505
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,440
Usually gets what he wants.

506
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,700
- And Carver?

507
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,500
- Stay away from him.

508
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,820
- I gotta uphold the law.

509
00:47:40,368 --> 00:47:42,430
- Well that ain't gonna
matter much to Carver.

510
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,140
He sorta makes up his own law.

511
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,835
- I know he was a Texas
Ranger and your partner.

512
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,350
What I don't know is what happened after

513
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,960
the massacre at Nogales Mesa,

514
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,472
that changed all that.

515
00:47:57,472 --> 00:47:59,272
- That was a long time ago, Sheriff.

516
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,620
Some things are better left in the past.

517
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,880
- Unless that past has
come back to haunt you.

518
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,520
He ain't done nothin' yet,

519
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,680
but it's like sitting on a
powder keg with a short fuse.

520
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,700
You got any idea what he's up to?

521
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,563
- Nope.

522
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,850
- [Sheriff] You gonna keep an eye on him?

523
00:48:31,564 --> 00:48:32,660
- That ain't my job.

524
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,733
- Prove it.

525
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,800
- That's my weddin' gown and you know it.

526
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,930
Everyone knows it.

527
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,700
- This just looks like yours, Jess.

528
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,540
A riverboat gambler in Louisiana gave this

529
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,530
to me for being his good luck charm.

530
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,080
- That's just one of your
made up little stories,

531
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,270
you little liar.

532
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,103
- I am not.

533
00:48:58,141 --> 00:49:00,974
- What the hells goin' on up here?

534
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,340
- Well, Rachel has a little problem

535
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,640
with things that don't belong to her.

536
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,510
- It's mine.
- Is not!

537
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,343
- It is.

538
00:49:08,343 --> 00:49:10,120
- Is not!
- It is!

539
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,080
- Donnie, whose is it?

540
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,839
- It's Jess's.

541
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,580
- Well then give it back.

542
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,000
- I won't.

543
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,130
You can't make me.

544
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:25,600
Here's your wedding gown.

545
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,800
That ship sailed a long time ago anyway.

546
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,140
- You mind tellin' me what
the hell that was all about?

547
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,760
- She's still hoping that a man

548
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,940
is gonna take her away from all this.

549
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:48,249
- It's gonna be a long wait.

550
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:53,546
(upbeat music)

551
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,600
Little young to be
drinkin', ain't you son?

552
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,860
- I didn't come in here for a drink.

553
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,060
- What can I do for you?

554
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,770
- My Pa' gave me $2 for my birthday.

555
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,960
He told me I should spend it here.

556
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,070
- Take your pick.

557
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,440
- I like 'em both.

558
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,685
- That may be a little dangerous, son.

559
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:48,470
- [Benjamin] I think I like the brunette.

560
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:52,435
- Jess will take care of ya.

561
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:53,935
Go on, you scared?

562
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,633
- Kinda.

563
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:56,820
- They ain't gonna bite ya.

564
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,530
Gotta pay extra for that.

565
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,553
- Hello.

566
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,460
- What's your name, Cowboy?

567
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,380
- It's Benjamin, ma'am.

568
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,530
- Well, we're gonna have a
real good time, Benjamin.

569
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,700
- Oh yeah, this is your lucky night.

570
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,660
We see it's a birthday special.

571
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,100
Two for the price of one.

572
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,570
- That's right.

573
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,660
- Almost feel sorry for the boy.

574
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,220
- He's gonna get his $2
worth, and then some.

575
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,750
- He's gonna go down
those stairs an old man.

576
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:38,800
- Oh, buy me a drink.

577
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,297
- Hey, Cowboy.

578
00:52:01,297 --> 00:52:03,600
You look kinda lonesome.

579
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,491
- Think so, huh?

580
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:07,000
(humming in agreement)

581
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,720
What's your name honey?

582
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,880
- My name's Rachel.

583
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,713
- Rachel, huh?

584
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:18,590
Well, Rachel, why don't you
go up and get us a bottle

585
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,900
and come back and keep me company.

586
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,190
- Whiskey?

587
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,023
- Who is that?

588
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,852
- He works for Bartell Mining.

589
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,090
Name's Carver.

590
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,740
- No one's mining this far north.

591
00:52:32,718 --> 00:52:33,551
- I know.

592
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:45,663
- I've see that look before,
Martin, I don't like it.

593
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,213
It's that man Carver, isn't it?

594
00:52:48,308 --> 00:52:49,141
- Yeah.

595
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:51,880
- What'd he do to you?

596
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,866
- It's not what he did to me.

597
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,900
Five years ago we were both Texas Rangers.

598
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,220
We were tracking these
killers down in Nogales,

599
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:08,900
we split up, he found 'em.

600
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,320
Pinned 'em down and tried to burn 'em out.

601
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,660
First people that came
through the smoke were women

602
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,350
and children, he didn't
care, he open fired.

603
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,713
- And?

604
00:53:30,455 --> 00:53:31,622
- And nothin'.

605
00:53:35,994 --> 00:53:37,666
- There you go.

606
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:38,700
- Thank you.

607
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,780
- You are so welcome.

608
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,010
- Come on, have a seat.
- That's a boy.

609
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,519
- [Glory] Rules out, Benjamin.

610
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:47,936
- [Jess] Pretty little scarf.

611
00:53:49,783 --> 00:53:53,533
- [Glory] Why don't you
just relax, Benjamin.

612
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:03,017
Jess will you give me a hand up here.

613
00:54:05,227 --> 00:54:07,430
I think that's good
enough, don't you Jess?

614
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,300
- [Both] Are you ready, Benjamin?

615
00:54:24,654 --> 00:54:25,487
- Yeah.

616
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:43,392
(giggling)

617
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:44,225
Whoa.

618
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,520
- This, is gonna cost you.

619
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:08,469
- It already has.

620
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,568
- Is that your gun?

621
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,667
- Yup.

622
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:40,560
- What a shame.

623
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:49,600
- You don't know how much
I'm lookin' forward to this.

624
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,890
- So am I, Cowboy.

625
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,350
- How long you work for Kanning?

626
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,980
- Oh, I'm self employed.

627
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,256
- You do it with him?

628
00:56:03,256 --> 00:56:06,320
- Oh yeah, all the time.

629
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,540
In fact, I'm one of his favorites.

630
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,090
He might even marry me.

631
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,235
- Is that so?

632
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:21,621
(humming in agreement)

633
00:56:21,621 --> 00:56:24,320
(chuckling)

634
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,920
Then I guess if something
were to happen to you,

635
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,690
he'd be real upset wouldn't he?

636
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:33,280
- Oh yeah, you'd be so sorry.

637
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:36,342
He'd just go crazy mad.

638
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:40,980
- Then I guess this'll
be a night to remember.

639
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,147
(gagging)

640
00:56:55,681 --> 00:56:57,764
(crying)

641
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:01,382
- Donnie, Donnie!
(frantic knocking)

642
00:57:01,382 --> 00:57:03,054
She's dead.

643
00:57:03,054 --> 00:57:04,221
Rachel's dead.

644
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:06,248
Donnie!

645
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:23,658
- Rachel.

646
00:57:23,658 --> 00:57:24,491
Oh Rachel.

647
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,123
Sweet Rachel.

648
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:32,679
Why would anyone do this to her?

649
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:36,783
- Jess, go get the Sheriff.

650
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,380
- Still such a child.

651
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,310
- I found the wallet.

652
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,830
She must've took it from him.

653
00:57:56,219 --> 00:57:58,620
(sniffling)

654
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,670
- It was him, the guy
from the mining company.

655
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,210
He killed her.

656
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:13,157
(horses trotting)

657
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,940
What are you gonna do about it, Sheriff?

658
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,610
- Well it seems fittin' she
should get a proper burial.

659
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:32,700
- No I mean, what are
you gonna do about it?

660
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,650
- Well, I'll contact the federal marshal

661
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,980
in Abilene and we'll proceed from there.

662
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,793
- Proceed from where?

663
00:58:38,793 --> 00:58:39,980
He'll be long gone by then.

664
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,790
Why aren't you going after him?

665
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:46,520
- Donnie, both you and I
know that Rachel was...

666
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:50,500
- Rachel was a whore.

667
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:54,483
Because she's a whore
you're not going after him?

668
00:58:54,483 --> 00:58:57,233
(dramatic music)

669
00:58:58,675 --> 00:59:01,870
If the guy had cheated at
cards or if he'd robbed a bank,

670
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,370
just because she's a whore.

671
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,050
- Donnie, I'm doing the best I can.

672
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,320
- No, you're not.

673
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,600
You're afraid of him!

674
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,820
You're a coward!

675
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:20,937
What about you Kanning?

676
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:24,500
You've tracked men for
weeks with nothing more

677
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,660
than a picture on a piece of paper.

678
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:32,310
I guess it's just a question
of money with you two.

679
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,660
What's the bounty for
killing a whore, Sheriff?

680
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,050
$2, $5?

681
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,760
Yeah, I guess it really wouldn't

682
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,260
be worth your while, would it?

683
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,337
- Ain't my job, Donnie.

684
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:01,020
- You're right about that, Mr.
Kanning, it ain't your job.

685
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,819
(door slamming)

686
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:06,319
(light music)

687
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:27,243
This is it.

688
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,320
This is her proper burial.

689
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,350
Rachel was a good girl.

690
01:00:37,586 --> 01:00:39,236
There's not even a preacher here.

691
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,330
- You know everyone loved Rachel.

692
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:47,060
- I think every man that ever
afforded the price of your

693
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,810
company is gonna be standing
here weeping when you're gone?

694
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,400
- Donnie, don't.

695
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,233
- It's true.

696
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,450
No one's gonna stand up for us.

697
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,450
- What are we gonna do?

698
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,929
- We're gonna stand up for each other.

699
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:07,512
(upbeat music)

700
01:01:20,782 --> 01:01:23,449
(whip cracking)

701
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,044
- What are you doing, Donnie?

702
01:01:52,044 --> 01:01:53,250
- What does it look like I'm doing?

703
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,000
- You're gonna get yourself killed.

704
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:59,130
- [Donnie] Well at least
we know we tried something.

705
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:01,290
- You can't go tracking Carver.

706
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,350
- And why's that?

707
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:05,326
The job was up for grabs,
no one else wanted to do it.

708
01:02:05,326 --> 01:02:07,280
- Listen to me.

709
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,509
Getting yourself killed is not
gonna bring back your sister.

710
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:15,272
- You just don't understand, do you?

711
01:02:15,272 --> 01:02:16,410
- You can't do this.

712
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:20,490
- There's only two things I can't do;

713
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,510
one is make love to a woman,

714
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,430
the other one is piss up a wall,

715
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,600
and right now there's only one of those

716
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,070
I regret not being able to do.

717
01:02:31,126 --> 01:02:32,771
(dramatic music)

718
01:02:32,771 --> 01:02:35,604
(horses trotting)

719
01:02:42,949 --> 01:02:45,616
(whip cracking)

720
01:03:37,844 --> 01:03:38,677
- Ladies.

721
01:03:39,758 --> 01:03:41,224
(chuckling)

722
01:03:41,224 --> 01:03:42,891
And not a camp fire.

723
01:03:43,877 --> 01:03:45,127
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

724
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:48,630
Now, is this anyway to
make four lonely guys

725
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,110
like us feel welcome?

726
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:57,880
Now then, we feel welcome.

727
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:00,120
Hello boys.

728
01:04:03,726 --> 01:04:06,249
We're gonna have a little fun.

729
01:04:06,249 --> 01:04:08,749
(gun banging)

730
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,160
- You ladies are gonna have
to do better than that.

731
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,450
- Sure is a good shot.

732
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,238
- Not bad.

733
01:04:25,238 --> 01:04:30,238
(guns banging)
(bottles shattering)

734
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:57,660
- That's not bad.

735
01:05:12,393 --> 01:05:13,226
You're not gonna have the gun

736
01:05:13,226 --> 01:05:14,860
in your hand the whole time though.

737
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,630
Gotta be able to get
it outta your holster.

738
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:18,463
- I will.

739
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,020
- All right, good.

740
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,540
Do your thinkin' before you draw.

741
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,870
Jess, you're aiming too high.

742
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:31,980
Glory, well, you just stay low.

743
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:42,729
- Is he gonna keep sneakin'
up on us like that?

744
01:05:42,729 --> 01:05:45,396
- Yeah, he gives me the willies.

745
01:05:50,873 --> 01:05:52,456
- Okay, let's ride.

746
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,400
- Don't get too comfortable Carver.

747
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,260
Remember I pay you to take
care of things out there.

748
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,180
- My men will tell me if there's anything

749
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,880
I need to take care of personally.

750
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,807
- Well, you might just
wanna think about this then,

751
01:06:20,807 --> 01:06:24,240
your men, the ones you sent
to propriate Cotton Ranch,

752
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,140
they ran into a little trouble.

753
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,290
- What kind of trouble?

754
01:06:29,379 --> 01:06:30,670
- Well it seems their
bodies were left with

755
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:34,330
the Sheriff in White Rocks
yesterday, by three women.

756
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:37,770
Well I guess respect just don't go

757
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:39,270
as far as it used to, does it?

758
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,103
- Kanning.

759
01:06:46,582 --> 01:06:48,782
- So is it personal
enough for you now, huh?

760
01:07:04,344 --> 01:07:05,177
- Shooter.

761
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,410
Bounty hunter named Kanning, you know him?

762
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:11,553
- Heard of 'em.

763
01:07:11,553 --> 01:07:14,120
- Well, he's headed here from
White Rocks with three women.

764
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,550
Take some men, see they never make it.

765
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:19,660
- Yes sir, Mr. Carver.

766
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:22,362
Pony up.

767
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:32,995
(horses trotting)

768
01:07:45,116 --> 01:07:47,616
(gun banging)

769
01:07:54,284 --> 01:07:57,201
- What the hell did he do that for?

770
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:01,589
- Come on, let's take it slow.

771
01:08:13,745 --> 01:08:16,245
(light music)

772
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,920
- They'll be here soon.

773
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:26,142
I know it.

774
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,610
This is gonna be like
pickin' crows off a fence.

775
01:08:47,096 --> 01:08:49,346
(clicking)

776
01:08:50,272 --> 01:08:52,522
Wait 'til they're in range.

777
01:09:03,262 --> 01:09:04,563
Put 'er down, boys!

778
01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:07,146
(guns banging)

779
01:09:15,390 --> 01:09:17,484
What the hell's goin' on here?

780
01:09:17,484 --> 01:09:18,317
- Hey!

781
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:22,633
(guns banging)

782
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:25,370
I don't think so.

783
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:29,199
Drop the belt.

784
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:34,078
Get up.

785
01:09:35,078 --> 01:09:36,160
I said get up.

786
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,150
You work for Carver?

787
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:40,453
- Yeah.

788
01:09:40,453 --> 01:09:41,703
- You take him a message.

789
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,890
You tell him there's no amount of money

790
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,320
is gonna buy him peace of mind.

791
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,240
Do you understand?

792
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,200
Get outa here.

793
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:17,060
Martin, I know what you're trying to do,

794
01:10:18,271 --> 01:10:19,371
but this is our fight.

795
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,670
- Just the same.

796
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:26,890
They know you're comin'.

797
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,060
You're gonna need help.

798
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,010
- Suit yourself.

799
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:35,490
But Carver's mine.

800
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:38,073
(upbeat music)

801
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:25,969
(gun banging)

802
01:11:32,223 --> 01:11:34,573
- I figure everybody's
entitled to one mistake.

803
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:47,760
- You know your dirty business is startin'

804
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,070
to make me feel real uncomfortable.

805
01:11:52,557 --> 01:11:54,707
You take care of this,
Carver, you hear me?

806
01:11:56,102 --> 01:11:58,250
I'll be damned if I were to
have some gun totin' whores

807
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,960
turning my town into a free-for-all.

808
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,693
- Bigs?
- Hm?

809
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,010
- You just got promoted.

810
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:19,730
Now, put a couple men in
the north road into town.

811
01:12:19,730 --> 01:12:21,390
Get somebody standin' on the hotel roof,

812
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:23,360
tell him to keep his eyes open.

813
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,890
If he sees anything move, kill it.

814
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:28,440
I don't want anybody getting
into town unannounced.

815
01:12:31,095 --> 01:12:33,845
(wind whistling)

816
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:37,310
- [Man] Whoa, hey, hey,
what's goin' on here?

817
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:38,400
- [Man] Looks like
Curly and Jake's horses.

818
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,298
- [Man] Hey everybody,
come on, look at this.

819
01:12:40,298 --> 01:12:41,480
- [Man] What's going on?

820
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,391
- [Man] It's Curly and Jake, they're dead.

821
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:44,849
- [Man] How'd it happen?

822
01:12:44,849 --> 01:12:45,949
- [Man] I don't know.

823
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:48,250
- [Man] Oh, come one,
let's go tell the boss.

824
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,820
He's not gonna like this.

825
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:52,070
Last I saw they went out with Shooter.

826
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:54,159
- [Man] They ain't never came back.

827
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,410
- [Man] Mr. Carver, Mr. Carver!

828
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:00,440
The horses brought back Curly
and Jake and they're dead.

829
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,407
It musta been that bounty
hunter and those women.

830
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:06,400
- Well unless all of you
wanna end up like these two,

831
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,470
I suggest you find that son of a bitch

832
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:11,730
and those three whores he's
got with him, you got it?

833
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:14,104
Now spread out!

834
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,906
(door slamming)

835
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:27,656
(wind whistling)

836
01:13:47,065 --> 01:13:49,815
(spurs rattling)

837
01:13:54,249 --> 01:13:56,999
(dramatic music)

838
01:14:04,308 --> 01:14:06,808
(gun banging)

839
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:10,024
(groaning)

840
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,797
(guns banging)

841
01:15:36,381 --> 01:15:38,016
- Hey guys!

842
01:15:38,016 --> 01:15:40,599
(guns banging)

843
01:16:07,215 --> 01:16:08,465
- We're closed.

844
01:16:28,764 --> 01:16:29,824
- Sorry.

845
01:16:29,824 --> 01:16:33,131
(gun banging)

846
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:34,330
- Damn you Carver.

847
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,870
I warned you.

848
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:39,440
You're supposed to be
looking out for my interest.

849
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,050
Where the hell are you goin'?

850
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:42,270
- I got a score to settle.

851
01:16:46,452 --> 01:16:49,152
(door slamming)

852
01:16:49,152 --> 01:16:52,402
(light dramatic music)

853
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:01,779
(gun banging)

854
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:32,192
(pounding)

855
01:17:32,192 --> 01:17:34,420
- [Judge] Court will come to order.

856
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:37,930
Martin Kanning, you have been found guilty

857
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,820
of gross negligence and
dereliction of duty,

858
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,800
resulting in the death of innocent people.

859
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,030
This court therefore strips
you of your rank in the Rangers

860
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:53,030
and sentences you to two years
hard labor at Yuma Prison.

861
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:57,080
Sentence to be carried out immediately.

862
01:17:59,673 --> 01:18:01,340
- Justice is served.

863
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,179
(fire crackling)

864
01:18:15,675 --> 01:18:18,925
(light dramatic music)

865
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:41,150
(guns firing)

866
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:46,936
- Jess.

867
01:18:50,218 --> 01:18:51,051
Jess.

868
01:18:56,366 --> 01:18:58,930
It's okay, just stay still, Jess.

869
01:19:00,357 --> 01:19:01,857
- I got 'em Glory.

870
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:08,349
(wind whistling)

871
01:19:08,349 --> 01:19:10,849
(gun banging)

872
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,990
- Hell of a time to run out of bullets.

873
01:20:17,034 --> 01:20:19,784
(dramatic music)

874
01:20:45,782 --> 01:20:47,880
I always like to make it a fair fight.

875
01:21:27,144 --> 01:21:29,644
(gun banging)

876
01:21:48,426 --> 01:21:50,509
- Now, it's a fair fight.

877
01:22:14,668 --> 01:22:17,168
(gun banging)

878
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:41,720
Justice is served.

879
01:22:46,206 --> 01:22:48,706
(gun banging)

880
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,980
(light music)

881
01:23:45,713 --> 01:23:47,713
- It's a long ride back.

882
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,170
- I'm not going back.

883
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,700
I hear there some nice
farmland east of here.

884
01:24:09,988 --> 01:24:12,796
- Jess, Glory, you okay?

885
01:24:12,796 --> 01:24:15,546
- [Jess] Yeah, I'll be all right.

886
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:27,924
(upbeat music)

887
01:24:38,945 --> 01:24:41,778
(thunder booming)

888
01:28:27,692 --> 01:28:30,525
(MultiCom Jingle)
