1
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,056
Oh! This looks yummy.

2
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,332
It's a part of my plan
so you miss me a lot, a lot, a lot...

3
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,576
You don't need a plan.
I'm already missing you.

4
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,895
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

5
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,454
Oh, you are missing me already.

6
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,975
Hey, I will miss the plane.

7
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,455
- You can't leave me like this!
- They won't wait for me!

8
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,935
Honey, I don't know
when we'll see each other again!

9
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,494
Don't get mad.

10
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,331
No, it's fine.

11
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,979
Look, it's your mom.

12
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,494
No way, I will call her later.

13
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,373
- Pick up, c'mon.
- No.

14
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,134
- You know what?
- What?

15
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,820
Since I'm traveling
to my parents' wedding anniversary...

16
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,658
- Right.
- So...

17
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,579
...I will ask them for money
so I can come see you.

18
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,818
- So I can go as soon as possible.
- OK, stop talking or you'll jinx it.

19
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,611
OK!

20
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,612
Oh, I can't wait to be there.

21
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,578
- I'm going to pack.
- OK.

22
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,770
- Do you need anything?
- No.

23
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,015
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

24
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,178
Do you need help?

25
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,255
- We'll talk, OK?
- Yes.

26
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,051
Deal.

27
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,252
- Phone me when you get there.
- Of course.

28
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,573
I will miss you. A lot.

29
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,858
- A lot, lot, lot...
- We'll keep in touch.

30
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,735
Here you go.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,171
- Do you have everything? Passport?
- Yes!

32
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,620
- Yes, yes, I got it.
- You sure?

33
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,896
A SKELETON IN THE CLOSET

34
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,775
Manuel Lieto?

35
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,857
- That's me.
- Come in.

36
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,929
Thanks.

37
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,493
Mom, I passed! Tell dad.

38
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,810
Honey, I passed, so I am going to move
up my trip to Villa Mercedes.

39
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,930
I love you a lot.

40
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,413
Are you going to Lieto's?

41
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,537
Yes.

42
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,369
The best pasta in town.

43
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,372
Are you their son?

44
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,099
One of them.

45
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,700
The sportsman?

46
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,494
No, that's my younger brother.

47
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,690
Ah, you're the oldest?

48
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,730
Mhmm.

49
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,931
Hey, is he still in Europe?

50
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,816
Yes.

51
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,773
He's the man, right?

52
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,049
He must be getting all the ladies.

53
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,379
Yes... you can drop me here.

54
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,459
Left or right?

55
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,809
Right, please.

56
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,530
What do I owe you?

57
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,575
Two hundred.

58
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,894
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

59
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,169
You're welcome.

60
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,338
- Have a good day!
- Thanks.

61
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,776
<i>What happened?</i>

62
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,017
What are you doing here?

63
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,410
Hi!

64
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,615
You came!

65
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,050
I thought you were coming on the weekend!

66
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,978
No, I'm here.
So do we have an alarm now?

67
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,694
Yes, there has been
a lot of break-ins here lately.

68
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,652
- We forgot to tell you.
- It's okay.

69
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,294
- Are you guys OK?
- Honey, dad could have picked you up...

70
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,299
- How did you get here?
- It's fine, I took a cab from the station.

71
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,331
What's up, dad? Did they break in here?

72
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,337
No, no. Just around the corner,

73
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,020
we are just a bit scared
but nothing happened.

74
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,418
So, you get up and it goes off?

75
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,211
N'), no!

76
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,775
That is only if you open the door
or touch the windows.

77
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,379
Oh, I can't believe you are here!

78
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,571
I just wanted it to be a surprise!

79
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,849
I'm sorry about this ruckus.

80
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,618
It's a beautiful surprise!

81
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,617
- Manu is here!
- Shh, mom!

82
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,014
- How's school?
- Good.

83
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,893
Good, I had some days off so...

84
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,375
- Also, I passed my exam.
- Yes, your mother told me!

85
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,169
Manu, what are you doing here?

86
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,211
Hi!

87
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,211
- How are you?
- Did you have to be so loud?

88
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,173
I'm sorry, okay?
That's some foul-smelling breath, huh?

89
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,210
Yummy!

90
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,539
Oh, I brought the thing for you.

91
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,537
- Did you bring me something?
- Nothing.

92
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,456
Wake Facu up!

93
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,379
I can't believe he didn't wake up
with all this ruckus.

94
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,490
Can I skip school today?

95
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,371
- Can she?
- No.

96
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,979
- C'mon, please.
- C'mon.

97
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,329
So we can catch up, mom.

98
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,131
- No.
- C'mon.

99
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,139
No, she missed a lot.
She is on the verge already...

100
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,978
Fine. Wait for me.
We'll have breakfast.

101
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,295
Yes, sure.

102
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,213
This is so nice!
It's so nice to have you home.

103
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,617
I could tell something was up, you know?

104
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,856
- As if I had delivered you myself.
- Oh yes, sure.

105
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,369
Just yesterday
I told Dora to fix your room.

106
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,774
- It's clean and ready.
- Really?

107
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,538
- Yes.
- Well, thank you.

108
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,810
- OK, I will settle in then.
- Okay, honey.

109
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,614
I left a bag there
with some stuff that's mine...

110
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,619
It's old.
Don't touch it.

111
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,774
C'mon, guys.

112
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,778
I'm running late to the factory,
I have to go to the municipality...

113
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,652
- Let's go!
- Hold on!

114
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,817
- Let's go!
- I'm having breakfast.

115
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,452
- Will you pick me up from school?
- Okay.

116
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,457
Yeah, sure. What time?

117
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,979
1PM, but be there earlier!

118
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,216
- I will walk there.
- No, c'mon!

119
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,136
<i>Facundo!</i>

120
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,217
Coming! He doesn't even
let me have breakfast.

121
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,660
Kiss mommy.

122
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,171
Oh!

123
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,973
- Bye, fag.
- Hey... what?

124
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,411
Hey, watch your mouth!

125
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,251
Every morning is the same thing.

126
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,217
I'm so tired, I swear.

127
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,617
- Do you want more?
- Yes, I'll grab one.

128
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,934
It's so great to have you here, son.

129
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,809
I'm so hBPPY-

130
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,011
I'm also happy, teacher.

131
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,097
25 years now...

132
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,179
The house is celebrating.

133
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,492
Although I have to tell you...

134
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,453
It's a mess.
I don't know why I got into this!

135
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,809
But it's fun!

136
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,329
I mean, it's the perfect excuse.
Are you nervous?

137
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,780
A little.

138
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,972
You are right. We have to celebrate.

139
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,215
I don't know...

140
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,649
Hey, mom...

141
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,410
What's up with dad?

142
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,895
Why does he have to go
to the municipality?

143
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,529
Oh yes, it's because
some people over there might be...

144
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,449
...well, they will sponsor
Luisito's match.

145
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,339
Is Luis coming?

146
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,458
If everything works out...

147
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,691
<i>Manu, baby!</i>

148
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,493
Hi, Dora!

149
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,859
- How are you?
- It's good to see you!

150
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,493
Likewise! You look so pretty.

151
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,373
I have some old lady issues but I'm okay.

152
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,491
No! You look beautiful.

153
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,215
Your mom told me you were here
but I couldn't find you.

154
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,491
- I was getting settled...
- You look great, kid.

155
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,576
Well, thank you.

156
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,099
I bought all the ingredients
to make the sauce you love.

157
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,779
Oh, yummy!

158
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,220
And maybe for a little dessert.

159
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,049
- You have a sweet tooth, kid.
- Yes, but only for your desserts.

160
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,615
Oh yeah, sure, charlatan.

161
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,570
- Listen, this is laundry.
- Okay, I'll take it.

162
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,099
Okay, thank you.

163
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,896
I'll get it.

164
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,974
Hello.

165
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,779
Yes, who is this?

166
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,259
Laura! It's been a while, how are you?
This is Manuel.

167
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,774
Fine.

168
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,690
My mom is not here.

169
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,295
No, I don't have a clue.
I can tell her you called.

170
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,537
Ok, I'll tell her to call you.

171
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,211
Okay. Bye.

172
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,980
Oh, at last!

173
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,296
- Hi!
- I was so sick of class!

174
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,899
Well, I'm here now.

175
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,057
- Thank you for coming.
- Why wouldn't I come...

176
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,569
when you were the only one
who was happy to see me?

177
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,496
Of course.

178
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,972
- How was it?
- Look at him...

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,090
Who is that?

180
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,015
- Martl'n?
- Yes.

181
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,495
Manuel?

182
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,690
- Teach.
- Long time no see!

183
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,572
- How are you?
- I'm good.

184
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,690
- You're good?
- Uh-huh.

185
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,857
- Visiting your sister?
- For a little while, yes.

186
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,371
That's great.
Okay guys, good to see you.

187
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,249
Oh, he is so hot...

188
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,779
- God, Clara!
- He is just so hot...

189
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,972
I mean it, look at him!
He only gets hotter by the day.

190
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,131
I don't have a chance though...

191
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,933
Why? Did he finally come out?

192
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,653
Not here, obviously.

193
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,010
But you can kind of tell and...

194
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,452
I think he used to date a former student
who apparently moved to Mendoza.

195
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,457
Maybe if I finish school
he will notice me.

196
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,890
- Yeah, right. You think?
- Yes!

197
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,533
What? Is he your teacher now?

198
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,094
Yeah, he is my literature teacher.

199
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,858
I don't understand anything

200
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,620
but when he turns around
and writes on the blackboard...

201
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,971
- That pant fits him in all the right...
- Okay, enough!

202
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,297
- I guess you're all grown up, huh?
- Shut up, you used to do the same!

203
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,854
No way. Wait... Facu?

204
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,050
He has PE.

205
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,295
Oh, bummer.

206
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,775
The teacher was so cool,
he even remembered you!

207
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,050
Yes, well, your brother is unforgettable.

208
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,057
As if! What did you do?

209
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,252
I wrote a great paper
on “Platero and I", that's what.

210
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,650
That's why?

211
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,934
“Platero is smooth, hairy,

212
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,180
so soft you could almost say
he is all cotton, no bones."

213
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,776
- He is talking about a penis...
- God Clara, c'mon!

214
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,015
It's true!

215
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,419

247
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,210
- I've had your poison, poison, poison!
- Mom!

248
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,854
- I've had your poison...!
- Could you knock first?

249
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,972
Oh, you used to say that to me always!

250
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,535
Golden saying:
“Knock before you come in...

251
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,812
- Well, I'm embarrassed.
- How could I miss that show?

252
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,251
Oh, “I've had your poison"!
That song was so cool.

253
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,815
You kept everything for me.

254
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,374
- It's all brand new.
- Listen...

255
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,889
I did all this... okay,
Dora helped me a little,

256
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,613
but I think this is all of it.

257
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,333
Look what I found.

258
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,289
What is that?

259
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,095
- This folder...
- No!

260
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,096
Do you remember?

261
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,609
How could I forget if I saved it for you?

262
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,890
But did we go together
to the Gran Rex theater...?

263
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,897
Exactly, we went to Buenos Aires.

264
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,580
(BOTH) When daddy took Luisito
to the tournament.

265
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,894
I swearl had forgotten...
Oh, I don't know.

266
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,979
- It's true, we went together.
- It was so long ago! We had so much fun.

267
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,818
That was a fun weekend, right?

268
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,132
- Look at this.
- Oh, Nati is so cute...

269
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,489
I can't believe it.

270
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,657
I can't believe
you saved all of this, mom.

271
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,453
How could I not?

272
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,258
- You're in good shape!
- Right?

273
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,939
I loved it.

274
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,210
So, listen up Manu,

275
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,970
I was considering having the grandparents
over for dinner, is that OK?

276
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,899
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah? So you can all meet.

277
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,170
- They really want to see you...
- Yes, that's OK mom.

278
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,131
Of course.

279
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,173
And that way
we can have some time together.

280
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,655
- I wanted to ask you something else...
- What?

281
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,691
- Come with me to the supermarket.
- No, no, no!

282
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,619
- C'mon!
- I don't feel like running into anyone.

283
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,893
I know you don't like it
but I want you to come with me.

284
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,055
C'mon...

285
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,091
I've had your poison, I've had...

286
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,416
Fine, alright, I'll join you.

287
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,416
Fine.

288
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,454
Hold on, let's see.
I don't remember if I saw this.

289
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,539
Oh, can I take one of these?

290
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,936
- So we have something sweet.
- Of course, son!

291
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,654
Take what you want.
Put it in the cart.

292
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,139
So honey, tell me,
how is everything back there?

293
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,171
How is school? Tell me everything.

294
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,449
Fine, everything's fine.

295
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,971
I'm studying so I brought some books
with me so I can read ahead...

296
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,692
Good!

297
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,018
So, actually I want to
talk to you guys about that.

298
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,333
Are you dropping out?

299
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,020
No, not quite but...

300
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,256
Phew!

301
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,851
That's good, because your dad and I think
these days are ideal for you to study.

302
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,620
You don't have to cook,
you have a maid...

303
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,380
Wait, let's get these chickpeas
so I can make some hummus.

304
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,130
Yes please, you make a mean one.

305
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,649
Oh, I've missed this.

306
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,056
Hi Rosa, how are you?

307
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,932
- Good.
- Good!

308
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,009
- Do you know who that is?
- No.

309
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,417
Don't you remember?
She is the mother of Facu's classmate.

310
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,737
Oh, she keeps going on and on
about her kids.

311
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,296
How her kids are the greatest thing ever,
and this, and that...

312
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,093
Do you know who their kids are?

313
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,134
- The oldest one...
- Yes?

314
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,375
- He's a cokehead.
- No way.

315
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,979
- He is a junkie.
- How do you know?

316
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,218
Honey, everybody here knows.
It's an open secret.

317
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,819
- Why do you care?
- Let's get milk.

318
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,376
Facu is always asking me for it
and I don't want to come back here.

319
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,535
OK.

320
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,619
Pick anything you want, seriously.

321
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,413
I already told Dora.

322
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,372
She's so happy you are here.

323
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,060
She wants to cook for you,
you know how she is.

324
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,614
But I had to
write her a list

325
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,334
because she can't remember
anything anymore. It's terrible.

326
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,292
She looked fine to me.

327
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,899
What?

328
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,011
- Are those low-fat?
- Yeah, both of them.

329
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,255
Oh, okay.

330
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,940
She is old, you know?
She is quite old.

331
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,459
Yes, I'm serious.

332
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,378
She can't clean
the ceiling anymore.

333
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,969
What if she falls and breaks a leg?
I mean just imagine.

334
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,818
If she sues we will go broke.

335
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,089
She can't bend down either.

336
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,416
There's a thick layer of dirt
on the kitchen floor.

337
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,258
But what can I do?
Poor woman.

338
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,212
- That's that. I can't kick her out.
- No!

339
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,375
You can't kick her out!

340
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,969
Well, no. I mean, it's a possibility.

341
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,454
Oh, I need this.

342
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,378
I mean it's not a possibility,

343
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,377
but I've been talking with your dad.

344
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,893
I don't think you should do it.
She's been with us for so long.

345
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,729
- Of course, and we all love her...
- Right!

346
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,373
But, you know...

347
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,209
I also don't want to get
into any trouble...

348
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,092
Wait, I didn't bring any deodorant.

349
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,292
Oh, okay. Yes, I use this one...

350
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,296
What else?

351
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,252
Uhm...
Oh, wait!

352
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,054
We are walking around
and I actually have a list...

353
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,409
We need...

354
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,218
- So mom, how is dad?
- We got this...

355
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,139
Uhm...

356
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,135
Your dad?
Fine. He's fine!

357
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,657
I mean, he is working a lot...

358
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,737
He's exhausted.

359
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,976
You know, the pasta shop
takes a lot of work.

360
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,215
But he's fine...

361
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,535
He's nervous.

362
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,618
Because when Luisito comes over
he deals with the club stuff...

363
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,378
Well, actually I was talking about me.

364
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,730
How is he with me, I mean..

365
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,610
Not fine...

366
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,538
He's hurt, Manu.

367
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,659
Why don't you talk to him?

368
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,169
I'm trying. I want to,
but I don't know,

369
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,860
he doesn't seem happy
with me here.

370
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,929
What?
What are you on about, Manuel?

371
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,459
He is your dad.

372
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,776
He adores you. We love you.

373
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,972
It's just that we didn't see you again
after that night.

374
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,933
You dropped the bomb
and left us all in shock...

375
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,813
...and then you disappeared.
What did you expect?

376
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,137
And now suddenly you are here,
three days earlier...

377
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,013
Look, that was the worst
Christmas eve of my life.

378
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,258
- Do you think it was easy for me?
- It was not easy for anyone.

379
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,415
Why did you come earlier?

380
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,770
Your father and I had already
ruled out you coming.

381
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,096
We always have to force you,
we have to call you...

382
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,689
And now here you are.
Is there something going on?

383
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,289
- No...
- Please, son, trust your mom. Tell me...

384
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,899
No, mom!
There's nothing going on.

385
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,852
I do want to talk
about something with you,

386
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,618
but nothing serious.

387
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,139
You are dropping out.

388
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,694
Of course, yes...
I knew it!

389
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,494
Seven years in Buenos Aires and
only three years of college?

390
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,372
- Oh, Facu, it's not right...
- It's Manuel!

391
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,570
Okay, Manuel.

392
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,019
It's not that easy, mom.

393
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,734
I want to tell you about
my plans with Méximo.

394
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,015
- Maximo?
- Yes, my boyfriend is called Méximo.

395
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,609
Okay, shh. Enough.

396
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,011
- Let's talk back in the house.
- No!

397
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,898
- Let's talk at home...
- Mom, I want to talk right now.

398
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,693
Is that so hard?

399
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,299
In the house.

400
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,775
- Here you go, love.
- That's six...

401
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,694
Thanks.

402
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,015
This is nice, right?

403
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,338
- And the aromatic plants over there?
- I love them.

404
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,298
- Stunning.
- Mom, dad.

405
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,615
Hi, son.

406
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,969
Can we talk?

407
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,420
Yes, of course.

408
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,132
- Here, I'll go.
- Okay.

409
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,299
What do you need, son?

410
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,299
- Nothing, I wanted to talk.
- Do you want one?

411
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,457
Yes. Thank you.

412
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,335
What?

413
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,690
Money. You need money.

414
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,219
You are beating around the bush.

415
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,332
You could have just asked for it
and save yourself the ticket here.

416
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,371
- That's it, right?
- No.

417
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,538
Are you dropping out?

418
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,615
No, dad, it's not that. Listen...

419
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,459
...I want us to talk
about what happened on Christmas.

420
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,332
No, son, no.

421
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,936
No, now's not the time.

422
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,698
Your grandparents are coming.
It's OK.

423
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,652
- But it is not OK!
- It's all good, Manu.

424
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,499
- It's all good, Manu!
- But it doesn't feel like it's all good!

425
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,850
- Don't...
- Dad, you don't treat me like you used to.

426
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,857
What? Son, please, c'mon...

427
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,540
Let's change the subject...
Tell me about your career.

428
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,856
Or should I say,
this walk you are doing.

429
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,697
C'mon, son.

430
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,699
<i>- Dad, Luisito is online! Come here!</i>
- Luisito!

431
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,810
- Let's go!
- What? No.

432
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,374
- You're keeping that?
- Yes.

433
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,253
- But... bring it...
- Just go. Go!

434
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,739
Okay, son, be good!

435
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,771
- Yes.
- Behave, okay?

436
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,651
Oh did it...

437
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,976
- Message him! C'mon!
- Wait... What? The sound is off.

438
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,773
No, no. Message him. Tell him:

439
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,573
“We are all here. We love you..."

440
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,771
- God, mom, he already saw you.
- Okay!

441
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,015
A m, A LOT!

442
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,770
- No, no. Don't write that, Facundo!
- God!

443
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,095
Come on, man!

444
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,734
- Manu, come closer so he can see you.
- I'm here!

445
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,453
- Say hi!
- Dora!

446
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,253
- Come here, Dora.
- Come here.

447
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,656
Luisito is going to be so happy.
Say hi!

448
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,415
Hey, let's eat, the grandparents are here.

449
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,455
What were you doing?

450
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,729
Nothing.

451
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,296
I was reading my old journal.

452
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,979
Let's hear something.

453
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,736
Listen:

454
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,018
“Today I watched “Mufieca Brava...

455
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,054
It was a great episode.
Natalia is amazing...

456
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,380
You wrote that?
Isn't there something more interesting?

457
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,376
Well, let's see...

458
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,060
Dear God, you were obsessed with Nati...

459
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,091
So what, I liked her!

460
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,095
Look at this:

461
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,809
“Today I played tennis. I ran a lot.

462
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,299
I am training for
the Rio Cuarto tournament."

463
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,418
That is so lame!
You were probably lying.

464
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,054
Hey, can I show you
my dress for the party later?

465
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,454
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it yet.

466
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,092
- No.
- Yes?

467
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,813
Of course I want to see it.
Wait!

468
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,930
What?

469
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,459
You are not wearing a bra.

470
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,412
- Why are you staring? No!
- You're so cheeky!

471
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,257
Shut up!

472
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,930
Don't make me talk about the Sua'rez,
they are my best customers.

473
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,131
They buy pasta
Monday through Monday.

474
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,136
Poor Sua'rez.

475
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,855
Poor Mari. That woman can't cook,
that's why they eat pasta everyday...

476
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,331
So, what about Luisito?

477
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,657
What do you know about him?
He is the only one missing here.

478
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,134
Luisito is in Europe.

479
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,170
Training hard.

480
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,576
We will have him home
for a couple of days.

481
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,815
- Yes!
- That's great!

482
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,819
He will stay a bit longer
because he will play a game here.

483
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,456
That's fantastic.
I would love to see him play.

484
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,856
Yes, and you will.

485
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,254
Of course, dad.

486
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,375
What is wrong?

487
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,377
Why are you huffing?

488
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,535
I want to go to my room.

489
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,855
C'mon, Facundo.

490
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,256
Honey, your grandparents are here.
Don't be rude.

491
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,451
Fine, go. If you are going
to put that face on...

492
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,331
- Just go.
- Mom!

493
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,451
- No, seriously.
- You didn't let me do that.

494
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,298
Come back for dessert, okay?

495
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,013
Did you hear grandma?

496
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,530
Come back for dessert!

497
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,611
That's not fair.

498
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,413
So, should I get to the gossip or not?

499
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,053
Yes, get to it, grandma.

500
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,529
Do you remember the Manriques,

501
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,731
who lived in front
of your grandmother's house?

502
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,850
How could I forget?

503
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,175
I don't remember.

504
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,779
I don't remember the Manriques.

505
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,494
You only remember
what's convenient for you.

506
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,379
It's the truth, dear!
You don't know what your grandpa is like.

507
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,059
- Okay, spill, mom.
- Gossip.

508
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,454
- Gossip?
- Gossip!

509
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,014
So, they came and went a few times

510
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,496
and now they are going back
because they had a child in Spain.

511
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,250
But with a nasty problem:

512
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,330
Their son turned out to be limp-wristed.

513
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,780
Do you get it...

514
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,298
That's life.

515
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,689
So this boy was in a relationship
with this very wealthy businessman,

516
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,935
a millionaire.

517
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,449
Well, the old man dies.
He was much older than the boy.

518
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,618
So Manrique's boy inherits a fortune.

519
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,734
Manrique is out of a job.
They own nothing.

520
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,136
He asks his son to help them
and he refuses.

521
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,170
But you know...

522
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,170
We all know these people
have a social problem

523
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,170
and most homosexuals
are very resentful and very vindictive.

524
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,894
Just watch TV,
look at their ways, everything.

525
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,931
They are always seeking revenge.

526
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,257
And not helping his parents
is this boy's vendetta.

527
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,018
These are complicated issues...

528
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,938
I don't know, grandma, I don't...

529
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,614
...you shouldn't generalize.

530
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,370
I am not, I'm simply commenting
on what happened to Manrique.

531
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,615
Why comment then?

532
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,572
If they were mean to him,
well, screw them.

533
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,576
What do you expect?

534
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,213
You are not a mother yet.

535
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,617
One day you will understand you would
give your life for your kids.

536
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,619
So they can be mean to you
and you have to be good to them anyway?

537
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,129
No, but he turned out like that.
What do you expect?

538
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,695
- Uhm, Manu--
- He didn't “turn out like that", grandma.

539
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,529
Yes, he did. In time, you
will think it over and say:

540
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,094
“Oh, my grandma was right...

541
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,609
- I hope I die before thinking that.
- No, you won't die.

542
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,935
Hey, Clara...

543
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,971
Manu, I brought tiramisu for you, my love.

544
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,569
You know you are my favorite
and you love my tiramisu.

545
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,293
But this one has...

546
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,419
Hi, baby.

547
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,170
Hi Manu, sorry I was a bit late.

548
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,213
It's okay, don't worry.

549
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,978
I just logged in.

550
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,170
How are you?

551
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,769
I'm doing good.
Where are you?

552
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,379
In the bathroom.

553
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,138
This house is crowded.

554
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,171
Privacy is a little difficult
to get.

555
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,735
I'm not used to being
with so many people anymore.

556
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,178
How are you?
What's going on there?

557
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,291
You didn't respond
to the picture I sent you.

558
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,297
Oh, I was just surprised...

559
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,976
...that you were
already there with your folks.

560
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,935
Yes, I wanted to come a bit earlier

561
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,939
so I could speak with them
about the money.

562
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,653
Oh, right...

563
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,176
What's going on there? It looks cloudy.

564
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,051
Is it...

565
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,177
Is it very cold?

566
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,133
Yes, today is not the nicest day.

567
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,694
Yeah, it's a little cloudy.

568
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,135
Yes...

569
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,775
What is that painting behind you?

570
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,460
Oh! It came with apartment.

571
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,690
You have no idea how badly
I want to be there, baby.

572
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,772
I want to be with you, hold you...

573
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,296
I found a great jacket for the trip!

574
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,776
Since it's cold there, I started looking
and found a great one.

575
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,857
- Let me show it to you.
- Hold on, Manu. Stop...

576
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,732
I wanted to talk to you about that.

577
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,569
Oh listen, according to my calculations

578
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,011
I think I could be there in about a month.

579
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,576
- Actually, that's--
- But wait, because I also thought

580
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,658
that if my parents give me the money

581
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,056
maybe I won't have
to look for a job either.

582
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,013
The thing is, I wanted
to talk to you about the trip.

583
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,290
What?

584
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:32,179
Well, I'll make this quick and easy
so I don't beat around the bush, okay?

585
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,854
Listen...

586
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,737
You are like...

587
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,857
...my story in Argentina, okay?

588
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,769
And I'm here now, and...

589
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,660
...I'm sort of meeting people,
experiencing new things,

590
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,771
making new friends...

591
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,293
...and if you come here...

592
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,814
...that ends.

593
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,011
I don't want you to come.

594
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,335
Come again?

595
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,737
I don't want you to come here.

596
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,812
Maximo, are you breaking up with me?

597
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,090
Sort of.

598
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,449
What do you mean, <i>“sort</i> of'?

599
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,130
You're either leaving me or not.
Answer my question! Don't act stupid.

600
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,573
Okay. Yes. Yes.

601
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,812
I'm breaking up with you, yes.

602
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,976
<i>Manuel, hurry up, dude!
1 need to go in!</i>

603
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,535
Son!

604
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,449
Do you know how long it's been
since we used that machine?

605
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,898
You are kneading ravioli!

606
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,733
Yes, I felt like it.

607
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,211
Oh, that's so nice!

608
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,177
It's been a long time since I made these,
so I hope they turn out OK.

609
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,856
You have your grandmother's gift.

610
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,649
Luisito arrives tomorrow.

611
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,179
- Really? Already?
- Yes.

612
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,370
How soon.

613
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,451
Well...

614
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,810
Mom, can I leave these to you?

615
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,692
- Yes, of course!
- Can you handle the rest?

616
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,176
Of course!
Thank you for these.

617
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,010
- Okay... they're done.
- Yummy!

618
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,251
I'm going to lay down
for a minute, okay?

619
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,578
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

620
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,419
- Yes. I'm just tired.
- Okay...

621
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,771
<i>Clara, I came here to be heard
and for you to solve this.</i>

622
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,891
<i>- Yes, OK Gladys. What I--
- Mom, calm down.</i>

623
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,456
<i>- Calm down?
- I just need you to calm down.</i>

624
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,854
<i>This is not what we agreed to.</i>

625
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,857
<i>You are not keeping
your end of the bargain...</i>

626
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,052
<i>Clara, I came here to talk,
let me speak...</i>

627
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,978
<i>- Gladys, please--
- You need to understand.</i>

628
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,329
<i>1 do understand you, Gladys!</i>

629
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,772
<i>So how can I calm down when you
are not keeping our agreement?</i>

630
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,130
<i>- Please
- Mom, listen to her...</i>

631
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,376
<i>1 know we have an agreement.</i>

632
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,013
<i>But we have different timings...</i>

633
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,289
Where are you going, fag?

634
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,490
What are you doing?

635
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,657
- You can't go in there.
- Oh no? And why is that?

636
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,578
If I can't go in, you can't go either.

637
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,373
But you are 14 years old, kid.

638
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,173
- Why are they here?
- I don't know.

639
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,335
Who knows.

640
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,695
If you talk to me like that
I will never unblock you

641
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,334
and you will always have
to call me to the landline.

642
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,096
No.

643
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,056
Oh, wait. I think
my brother's listening in on us.

644
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,216
<i>Manuel!</i>

645
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,933
What are you doing
listening in on me?

646
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,051
- I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

647
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,100
- You can't spy on me!
- Well, what do you want me to do?

648
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,814
- To not spy on me?
- Okay, fine...

649
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,216
- Also, you owe me a conversation.
- What?

650
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,569
Yes.

651
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,375
About what?

652
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,538
- You said we could talk.
- Listen to me for a second.

653
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,173
What? You never tell me anything.

654
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,574
- Would you listen to me?
- What?

655
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,579
- What's going on with Laura and mom?
- I don't know.

656
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,976
You don't you know?
What are they doing here?

657
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,853
Laura's mom comes over sometimes.
Maybe they remained friends.

658
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,653
- Friends? Why is she here?
- I don't know.

659
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,453
- Are we going to talk or not?
- No...yes.

660
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,218
But I'm talking
and you won't answer.

661
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,296
I want to talk about us.

662
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,934
- I want to talk about you.
- What do you want to hear?

663
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,018
- About Buenos Aires...
- No. Tell me about mom and Laura.

664
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,938
- Why is she here?
- I have no clue!

665
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,176
Could you tell me about your boys?

666
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,257
- What do you mean by <i>“my</i> boys”?
- You know.

667
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,496
- What are you going on about?
- Move over.

668
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,531
Actually, your brother is rather picky.

669
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,014
You're picky. Yeah, right.

670
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,609
I'm not some floozy
that hooks up with everyone.

671
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,579
I'm sure you are

672
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,296
C'mon, tell me more!

673
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,333
- I don't know what you want to hear!
- Everything!

674
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,771
About what? I'm your brother,
I don't know what you're going for...

675
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,810
Well...

676
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,256
What?

677
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,972
Sex.

678
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,818
- No, we won't talk about that.
- Yes.

679
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,931
- No, we are not having that conversation.
- Why?

680
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,256
Because I'm your brother
and I have nothing to say...

681
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,495
Oh, don't be like that.

682
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,610
No, well...

683
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,017
You do it and I do it.
We're both adults.

684
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,451
As an older brother, it is
your responsibility to give me tips.

685
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,934
- Is it now?
- Yes.

686
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,858
Who do you want me to talk to?
Mom?

687
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,177
I don't know.
Maybe with your friends?

688
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,053
Of course I talk about it with my friends
but it's not the same.

689
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,330
- How come?
- Your experience is more useful to me.

690
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,418
Are you shitting me? Useful?
My experience is useful?

691
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,610
Obviously!

692
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,254
I mean, you have it and you suck it.

693
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,178
You have the best of both worlds.

694
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,613
- Well, you are right about that.
- See?

695
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,050
- C'mon. Let's share experiences.
- Wait, hold on...

696
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,454
Are you in a relationship?

697
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,256
Sort of.

698
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,417
What do you mean?
Who are you dating?

699
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,577
You don't know him.
Also, why does that matter?

700
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,260
Well, first of all: I should know him.

701
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,291
- Second of all...
- Are you my bodyguard now?

702
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,730
You have to ask me
for permission to date someone.

703
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,497
Excuse me?

704
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:16,373
Of course, you should
always ask your oldest brother.

705
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,619
- Not anymore.
- Why not?

706
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,617
- Will you give me some tips or not?
- OK...

707
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,856
Teach me...

708
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,098
- Teach me to give great blowjobs.
- No, you are insane!

709
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,734
- Why not?
- Because you are crazy. How could 1...? No!

710
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,817
- Come on!
You are my little sister, I can't!

711
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,692
I'm old and so are you.

712
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,700
- Precisely.
- Oh God...

713
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,812
You should feel proud that
I will know how to do it properly.

714
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,135
Well, let's see...

715
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,339
Have you tried with food?

716
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,736
No...

717
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,570
- How?
- Okay, there is an infallible trick

718
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,419
which works every time: a mint.

719
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,370
- What do you mean a mint?
- A little pill.

720
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,014
Sorry to interrupt the talk
between the fag and the slut

721
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,494
but dinner's ready.

722
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,533
Could you
knock on the door first?

723
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,053
- Shall we?
- Hold that thought, OK?

724
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,490
Seriously, don't forget.
Because you always do this.

725
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,452
Come on, stop it.

726
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,575
So how does the mint work?

727
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,531
Like so.

728
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,929
- Pass the cheese.
- Shall we start?

729
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,812
This looks amazing!

730
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,932
Did you knead these, Clara?

731
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,652
Me?

732
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,930
- Yeah.
- No! Manuel did.

733
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,500
Really, Manu?!

734
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,179
These are amazing.

735
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,295
You have to go train
the cooks at the factory.

736
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,013
It's not a big deal...

737
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,450
- They are not so great.
- Yes, they are!

738
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,811
You were always a very good cook, son.
You need to own it.

739
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,217
Oh wow! Let's hear it
for the ravioli maker!

740
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,255
Of course! Of course.

741
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,610
- The master of ravioli.
- They are amazing!

742
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,613
- Amazing.
- I'm sure you bought them.

743
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,333
Yeah, right.

744
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,736
You are going
to make these again, right?

745
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,817
Luis will be very upset he missed this.

746
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,657
Right!

747
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,179
- Luisito likes the ones with ham...
- Yes, he will go nuts over these!

748
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,291
Mom, did you know
the best ham is from Spain?

749
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,218
Well, whatever!

750
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,933
He won't care about the ravioli.

751
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,610
Nevermind the ham. The important thing
is that your brother made these.

752
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,698
Also he is used to his brother's cooking.

753
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,811
Then I also want
a special dish just for me.

754
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,534
- Okay, I will cook for you too!
- Squash ravioli!

755
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,571
- Okay, done.
- Customer's choice.

756
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,580
What's wrong?

757
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,809
Facu?

758
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,410
- What do you care?
- Hey, wow!

759
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,420
Don't be rude.

760
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,100
- So <i>I</i> am rude?
- Yes, don't talk to your mother that way.

761
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,097
You are going to teach me manners?

762
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,490
What's going on, son?

763
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,134
- Okay, enough...
- Stop it. Don't disrespect me.

764
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,811
- Stop it.
- I am OK, not that anybody cares.

765
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,736
- Honey, I asked both of you.
- No, you asked him.

766
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,930
Okay, okay!

767
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,812
So how are you? Tell us.

768
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,499
Yeah, how's school?

769
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,899
<i>How's</i> school?I got a D.
Let's talk about something else.

770
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,249
You got a D?

771
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,700
Are you okay?

772
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,738
Way to change the conversation, huh?

773
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,817
- I'm okay.
- What did you do today?

774
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,057
Not much. I did a couple of laps.

775
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,932
Like around town with the dog.

776
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,176
Next week you
are going back to college, right?

777
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,179
In theory, yes.

778
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,617
You have to hurry up with that, son.

779
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,016
I want you to give me
some tips for the factory.

780
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,733
I want to make some renovations.

781
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,170
- Should we head there one of these days?
- OK.

782
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,418
- Fine. We'll see.
- That's great. I'd love that!

783
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,974
We can offer your services.

784
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,489
- Should we hang up a sign?
- No.

785
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,372
Manuel Lieto. Architect.

786
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,979
- What? No!
- Why not?

787
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,454
Because he is the ravioli maker.

788
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,379
Oh, funny! Mom, first of all,
I haven't graduated yet.

789
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,771
- Exactly.
- Second of all, why all this circus?

790
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,811
- Then hurry up.
- Could you renovate my room?

791
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,251
Yes, and once you start practicing,
you will need those clients.

792
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,849
So that promotion will come in handy.

793
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,415
- Meanwhile, practice with your sister.
- Do the bathroom!

794
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,975
- Yes, the bathroom!
- And a closet!

795
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,376
Are you insane?

796
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,014
What? You moved out.
I get your room.

797
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,778
What are you doing here, fag?

798
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,700
What are you doing,
coming in like that? Ask first.

799
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,413
- This is my storeroom.
- Hey!

800
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,292
<i>-“Your"storeroom?
- Yes.</i>

801
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,979
Isn't that funny.

802
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,771
Hey.

803
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,734
- What do you want?
- Listen...

804
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,010
What's going on with Luisito?
Is everything okay?

805
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,369
- With Luisito?
- Yeah.

806
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,899
Yes, fine.
What could be wrong?

807
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,057
I don't know, something's off.

808
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,170
Do you know something?

809
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,052
No, dude.
What is wrong with you?

810
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,931
<i>Hello?</i>

811
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,380
Hi, is Laura home?

812
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,854
<i>Who</i> E <i>looking for her?</i>

813
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:14,858
A friend.

814
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,698
<i>No, Laurita is not here.</i>

815
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,857
I'm a former schoolmate.

816
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,378
Nevermind. Bye.

817
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,610
Laura.

818
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,933
Hey, Manuel, how are you?

819
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,858
- I'm good.
- Well, this is a surprise!

820
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,094
How long have you been in town?

821
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,619
I got here a few days ago.

822
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,369
Do you need anything?

823
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,377
Yes. I want to talk to you.

824
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,930
What's up?

825
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,220
Could you tell me what's going on
between you, your mom and my parents?

826
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:28,332
Nothing, why?
I don't understand your question.

827
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,574
The other day I heard you all
talking in my house,

828
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,896
and now I found out
we are paying for your healthcare?

829
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,694
Nothing's wrong.
They are helping us out.

830
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,209
Really? My parents
don't just help out people.

831
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,973
Manuel, I have to go.

832
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,499
No! Laura, please.

833
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,815
Tell me.
I can help you.

834
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,898
Manuel, don't you realize
what's going on?

835
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,809
Healthcare. My mom.
Your parents.

836
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,012
Me. Your brother.
Don't you get it?

837
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,499
Are you pregnant?

838
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,979
Wait. Laura!

839
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,611
You're a little out of shape.
What's up?

840
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,252
No, I'm not.
I run everyday.

841
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,850
I'm not used to
playing tennis anymore.

842
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,812
Even better.
I'll be gentle.

843
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,010
I want to beat you.

844
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,450
Yeah?

845
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,411
You are on top.

846
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,736
Well, there's no match for me here.

847
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,890
Everyone in this club is a wimp.

848
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,619
Do you know who is very good
but ignores me?

849
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,333
- Your brother.
- Facu?

850
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,451
He's a genius.
Have you seen him play?

851
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,090
He's got a gift.

852
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,131
He's got Federer's handback.
It's amazing.

853
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,376
The thing is he is
slacking off all day.

854
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,013
He doesn't want
to practice with me.

855
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,210
He's young-

856
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,980
Besides, isn't one tennis player
in the familiy enough?

857
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,900
Your sister could also
have a good career.

858
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,049
Your sister could also
have a good career.

859
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,374
There are almost no
female tennis players in this town.

860
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,899
- Shall we?
- No. Wait.

861
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,738
Could we go to the bar
and talk a little?

862
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,214
Talk? Yes.

863
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,536
Can we talk in the car?
I have to be at work by six.

864
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,860
- Come on, let's go.
- OK.

865
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,099
- Come on, let's go.
- OK.

866
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,290
Dad...

867
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,574
I would like to have
a good relationship with you.

868
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:03,180
I feel like ever since Christmas,
something broke between us and...

869
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,780
...I don't know.

870
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:05,939
...I don't know.

871
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,856
Just now, while we were playing,

872
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,056
we seemed disconnected,
and it didn't use to be like that.

873
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,411
Hold on.

874
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,178
- Honey!
- Yes, what's up, Clara?

875
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,529
<i>Luisito is here.</i>

876
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,650
Oh!

877
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,014
Oh, that's wonderful news, honey!
Thank you!

878
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,289
<i>TH see you later!</i>

879
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,457
OK. Change of plans, Manu.

880
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,139
I'm heading back to the club.

881
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,410
I want to finish
coordinating the match.

882
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,735
What match?

883
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,700
I'm organizing a match
so the Secretary of Sports

884
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,930
I'm organizing a match
so the Secretary of Sports

885
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,655
can watch Luisito and maybe help us
sponsor him in Europe.

886
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,898
And while we're at it,
we throw a match for the kids around town

887
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,014
who are stuck, to encourage them.
It's a nice idea, right?

888
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,780
So they know if they want
to be an athlete, they can.

889
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,779
There's a lot of drugs here.

890
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,290
So Luisito will inspire them?

891
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,970
Right, yes. Who better than Luisito
to inspire them?

892
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,100
Drop me off here.

893
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,612
Drop me off here.

894
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,492
- What?
- I want to get off.

895
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,452
- Wait, why?
- Because I want to get off here.

896
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,730
- I'll take you home.
- No need. I'll get off here.

897
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,056
But... Fine, I'll drop you off
but what's wrong?

898
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,171
- Nothing. We'll talk later.
- Just tell me--

899
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,210
Nothing.

900
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,940
Please, tell me you became a reader
thanks to my lessons.

901
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,011
Please, tell me you became a reader
thanks to my lessons.

902
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,530
Teach.

903
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,819
"Teach"? You graduated
a long time ago, am I right?

904
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,692
About seven years ago.

905
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,851
That's a lot.

906
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,970
How are you?

907
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,900
I'm good.
Taking a walk around town.

908
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,492
I'm good.
Taking a walk around town.

909
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:05,930
I noticed the bookshop
and I wanted to get a book.

910
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,616
And you, sir?

911
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,016
You are killing me.
First <i>"Teach"</i> and now sir?

912
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,734
Could you address me as you?
Look, you make me nervous.

913
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,294
Sure, okay.

914
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,340
So...

915
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,579
So...

916
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,453
- You are walking around?
- Yes.

917
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,379
Yes, I'm visiting my family.
There are family events.

918
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,695
That's great.

919
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,609
Did you read that one?

920
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,300
No, but it looks interesting.

921
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,574
No, but it looks interesting.

922
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,853
It's good. It's about
an Italian restaurant in Mar del Plata.

923
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,210
OK, if you recommend it

924
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,819
then maybe I'll take it.

925
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,009
Do you like cooking?

926
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,410
Let's say...

927
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,698
I have my ways.

928
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,330
Take it.

929
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,176
- No, but...
- Take it, really.

930
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,017
I can pay for it.

931
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,220
You can thank me with something tasty.
Homemade, of course.

932
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,732
You can thank me with something tasty.
Homemade, of course.

933
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:58,291
OK, but I can pay for it,
it's no big deal.

934
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,534
I am the owner.

935
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,690
That's nice.

936
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,659
Loaf cake?

937
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,010
Perfect.

938
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,375
Leave it, miss.

939
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,619
I'll do it. You don't put salt or oil
in it and the kids hate that.

940
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,140
Oh, Dorita is schooling you!

941
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:21,652
Oh, Dorita is schooling you!

942
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,974
Your brother is here.

943
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,090
- Yes?
- Yes. Go say hi.

944
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,372
- He is settling into his room.
- Already?

945
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,891
Yes, he just got here from San Luis.
Good thing the flight was on schedule.

946
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,130
<i>Aka'!-</i>

947
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,290
That's it.

948
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,895
Manu! Bro!

949
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,971
How are you?

950
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,540
- I'm good.
- Long time, no see.

951
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:47,654
- I'm good.
- Long time, no see.

952
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,693
Mom told me you were in town.

953
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,655
- Are you OK?
- Yes, I came here for a couple of days.

954
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,100
- Great.
- How are you?

955
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,130
Good.

956
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,570
We are all here.

957
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,010
Great!

958
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,500
So it would seem.
Like the good old days.

959
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,659
So it would seem.
Like the good old days.

960
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,219
So you are on a diet?

961
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,930
You mean this?

962
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,339
- Eating healthy?
- Shut up.

963
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,530
My big brother.

964
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,135
This is nice.
Are you coming to the match?

965
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,097
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think so.

966
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,176
Maybe I'll stop by.

967
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,940
I only came here for mom and dad's thing.

968
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,899
I didn't want to
do a lot of things.

969
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,420
Well, but it's just a match.
If you get bored you can leave.

970
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:26,898
Well, but it's just a match.
If you get bored you can leave.

971
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,178
Fine.
Maybe I'll go.

972
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,450
What's up, kids?

973
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,934
- Hi, dad.
- Hello.

974
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:32,891
Two things:

975
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:38,732
First. We decided since Luisito is here,
we're going to do a new family photo.

976
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:39,380
- Okay.
- Second thing.

977
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:39,938
- Okay.
- Second thing.

978
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,734
Tonight. Party in the club.
For you, Luisito.

979
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,613
- For me?
- Yes, of course it's for you, dear.

980
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,457
- But why?
- Why? Because you are here.

981
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,934
I got some big names.

982
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,340
The head of the Municipality,
the Secretary of Sports...

983
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,659
The head of the Municipality,
the Secretary of Sports...

984
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,420
Hey! The Secretary is coming to see you.

985
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,578
But I came home to relax,
not to do a parade.

986
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,374
I want to spend time with you.
Rest up. Take a walk.

987
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,218
Go to your party.
Eat like a pig.

988
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,780
Son, one thing
doesn't cancel out the other.

989
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:05,939
Son, one thing
doesn't cancel out the other.

990
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,930
You can do all that and still
attend tonight's party in your honor.

991
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,212
And the picture will take one second.
Don't make this hard.

992
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,810
It's your mother's wish.
You too Manuel, please don't start.

993
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,740
I didn't say anything!

994
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,377
I didn't say anything!

995
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,455
And that's dad.

996
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,049
Welcome home.

997
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:08,650
Manu!

998
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,575
What are you doing here?

999
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,659
This circus is for you.

1000
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,740
I don't want to be there.

1001
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,774
They talk to me like I'm Nadal.

1002
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,777
They touch me...
It's all very fake.

1003
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,570
Do you want?

1004
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,339
Why are you smoking that?

1005
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,011
It's okay. It's just grass.

1006
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,579
You have a match
to play tomorrow.

1007
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,291
That match is some crap
dad put together.

1008
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,649
You know him.

1009
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,980
He put this together
so the Municipality will sponsor me.

1010
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,694
So they pay the hotels,
the training sessions.

1011
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:49,940
Bullshit.

1012
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,020
Bullshit.

1013
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:50,971
Exactly.

1014
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:54,252
If dad finds out
you are smoking this he will kill you.

1015
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,055
How are you doing?
How is Europe?

1016
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,090
I'm great.

1017
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:02,900
Barcelona is amazing.
The buildings, the architecture...

1018
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,531
Barcelona is amazing.
The buildings, the architecture...

1019
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,934
...the streets.
And the sea is so beautiful.

1020
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,858
You should come with me!

1021
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,254
You would love it there.

1022
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,454
Sometimes I think
I'd like to stay for good.

1023
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,018
Don't say that out loud.
Mom might die if she hears

1024
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,893
her baby will move
to Barcelona forever.

1025
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,730
That's true.

1026
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,729
And how are you doing?

1027
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,129
Not great.

1028
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:47,655
I broke up with my...

1029
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,659
With your boyfriend?

1030
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,656
How did you know?
I never told you.

1031
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,499
We all know.

1032
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,699
I have known for a while now.

1033
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,734
It's okay by me.

1034
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,977
You are my brother
and I love you.

1035
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,499
And about the breakup:

1036
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,180
You are handsome guy,
you will find another guy.

1037
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,898
You are handsome guy,
you will find another guy.

1038
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,579
Especially living in Buenos Aires.

1039
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,020
There's a million people.

1040
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,135
Yeah, I don't know...

1041
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,140
Who knows.

1042
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:21,174
Who knows.

1043
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,569
I hope so.
What about Laura and you?

1044
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,530
That's over.

1045
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,655
But, I mean...

1046
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,977
Did something happen
the last time you saw each other?

1047
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,100
No, nothing happened.
We just decided to take different roads.

1048
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,616
No, nothing happened.
We just decided to take different roads.

1049
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,450
We thought it was for the best
if we both did our own thing.

1050
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:52,251
I don't know. If you are here,
why don't you talk to her?

1051
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,700
Isn't she coming tonight?

1052
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,295
I didn't tell her.

1053
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,218
Also, she knows I'm in town.

1054
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,020
She must have heard
and still she didn't text me.

1055
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,418
She must have heard
and still she didn't text me.

1056
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,777
If I were you, I would talk to her.

1057
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,650
At least to ask her how she's doing.

1058
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,655
What for?

1059
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,975
I'm not sure.

1060
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,019
- Did you hear that scream?
- I did.

1061
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,735
I think it was Flavia.

1062
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,371
<i>Nothing happened.
Something happened.</i>

1063
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,774
<i>It did because she saw you.</i>

1064
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,970
- What happened?
- Nothing!

1065
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,694
- I'm telling <i>you</i> what <i>I</i> saw, sin
- She's exaggerating.

1066
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,174
Get in the car now, Clara!

1067
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:39,380
Get in the car!

1068
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,495
Get in the car!

1069
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,499
And you, punk,
get the hell out of here!

1070
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,894
- Get in the car!
- Honey, go.

1071
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:45,612
Get in the car!

1072
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,778
You ruined your brother's party.
Do you get it?

1073
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,414
No more scandals.
All of you, get out. Go home!

1074
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,340
You too. Get out.

1075
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,057
You too. Get out.

1076
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,099
Please.

1077
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,291
I am going to ask you for a favor.

1078
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,014
I need what happened
to remain between me and you.

1079
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,693
- It's very important to me.
- No problem, sir.

1080
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,300
I appreciate it.

1081
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,210
I appreciate it.

1082
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,329
We want to award this trophy to Luis.

1083
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,291
Or Luisito,
as we all call him,

1084
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:08,449
for gracing this place
with his presence this afternoon.

1085
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,730
Thank you.

1086
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,769
Thank you so much.

1087
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,971
A little longer.
Share some words.

1088
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,533
I want to thank you
for sharing this afternoon with me.

1089
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,369
I'm happy to be back in the club
that saw me take my first steps.

1090
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,776
I lived a lot here
and made a lot of friends.

1091
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,929
I would love it if someday
we could do an international tournament,

1092
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,653
under this administration.

1093
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,498
So thank you.

1094
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,410
<i>Who is it?</i>

1095
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,090
Manuel.

1096
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,775
Manuel Lieto.

1097
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,215
<i>Oh! I'm coming!</i>

1098
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,530
- Hello.
- Hi.

1099
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,298
- How are you?
- I'm good!

1100
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,615
You're good?
Come on in.

1101
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,299
- Excuse me.
- Yes, please, come in.

1102
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,290
<i>Aka'!-</i>

1103
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,730
Here we are.
It's bitter.

1104
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,055
- Perfect.
- Great.

1105
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,978
- Will you do the honors?
- Sure, thanks.

1106
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,853
- It's orange and cinnamon.
- It looks amazing, I love it already.

1107
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,459
- Do you like those?
- Yes, I love it.

1108
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,936
- And nuts.
- There's some nuts as garnish.

1109
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,859
- Nice detail.
- It's a family recipe.

1110
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,291
Are you sure you didn't
buy that at a bakery?

1111
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,330
You think so?

1112
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,935
Of course not.

1113
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,295
You'll see.

1114
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,491
Hold on.

1115
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,213
- Let's switch.
- There we go.

1116
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,815
This is nice.
I'm happy to see you again.

1117
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:57,129
Tell me more about you,
your life in Buenos Aires, I don't know...

1118
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,295
Are you in college?

1119
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,418
Yes. Architecture.

1120
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,974
- Awesome!
- Yes...

1121
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:06,090
I think it served more as a way to escape
than anything else.

1122
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,653
I was tired of Mercedes
and I needed to leave.

1123
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,339
That's OK, I get it.

1124
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,212
I'm glad you got out.

1125
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:16,979
For me...

1126
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:21,179
I think a lot about leaving.

1127
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:25,658
But I also feel like
I have a job here and...

1128
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,259
...once you get old,
you have other concerns.

1129
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,934
- Well, you're not that old.
- Oh, but I am.

1130
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,698
But you seem
to be doing good here.

1131
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,810
I'm doing fine.

1132
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,616
But it's just... fine.

1133
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,933
Because here, I mean...

1134
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,016
...I would like to live in a bigger city,

1135
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,892
where nobody stares at you

1136
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,499
where they don't gossip so much.

1137
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,975
Well, that's exactly why
I grew tired of Mercedes.

1138
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:59,695
Everyone has an opinion or a comment
and you're always running into someone.

1139
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,020
And the truth is...

1140
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,699
I don't like that.

1141
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,733
I... don't like that
I can't be myself.

1142
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,774
- And did you find yourself?
- I think so.

1143
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,253
At least you searched for yourself.

1144
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,095
That's the important thing.

1145
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,337
I'm glad I ran into you.

1146
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,974
It's been so long, right?
I see you...

1147
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:25,896
...older. Well, you were a kid.

1148
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:27,693
Well, I graduated seven years ago.

1149
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,170
Right.

1150
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:31,935
YOU 3Y6 more mature.

1151
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,290
You are handsome.

1152
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,060
- Very.
- You are very handsome too.

1153
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,340
Just gray-haired.

1154
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,734
It looks good on you.

1155
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,253
- I like them.
- I shouldn't dye them?

1156
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,576
- No! They will gossip if you do.
- Yes!

1157
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:15,289
Is this okay?

1158
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,535
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1159
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,214
- Oh, that's the doorbell.
- Oh, no!

1160
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,775
Do I have to go?

1161
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:39,131
Unless you want to stay for
a private lesson in syntactic analysis.

1162
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,094
No, I'm good.

1163
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,575
<i>Coming!</i>

1164
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,054
Can we talk?

1165
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,090
Sure.

1166
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,697
What's up? Do you have
more pointers for me?

1167
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,179
Did you know Laura is pregnant?

1168
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:02,291
- Do you want to see my dress--
- Hey!

1169
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,178
So you know she is pregnant.

1170
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,419
Yes, of course I do.

1171
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,860
Does Luis know?

1172
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,979
No Manu, how would he know?

1173
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,296
They can't keep this from him.
It's his son!

1174
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,013
I don't know. Mom told me
if we tell him now...

1175
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,098
...he won't want
to go back to Europe.

1176
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,178
And that this is his breakout year.
And she is a little bit right.

1177
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,450
No, she is not!
Are you both insane?

1178
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:28,049
- What's wrong with you?
- Well, I don't know!

1179
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,019
I don't know what
to make of this.

1180
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:32,256
But if you don't want
any more drama, shut up.

1181
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,016
My thing last night
was enough drama for now.

1182
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,409
So, how are you?

1183
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:42,656
To be honest, I guess
I'm a little pissed.

1184
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,690
Why?

1185
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,296
Because.
Also he won't text me back.

1186
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,819
He will write back.

1187
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,454
He must be shit-scared
with all that yelling.

1188
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,933
Yeah... was that necessary?

1189
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,858
I mean, you know dad.

1190
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:05,536
<i>Mann.</i>

1191
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,291
Hey.

1192
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:10,649
What are you reading?

1193
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,093
This new book about a restaurant.

1194
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,699
You are really into cooking.

1195
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,011
And you?

1196
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,053
- Are you OK?
- Yes. I was walking around town.

1197
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,774
- Do you know who I ran into?
- Who?

1198
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,653
Remember my friend "Butter" from school?

1199
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,169
- The short brunette one.
- Oh, yeah.

1200
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,814
We were talking and he told me
he is going to be a dad.

1201
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:38,975
No way!

1202
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,249
Really?

1203
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,852
Well, that's good news, right?

1204
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,534
Not really.

1205
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,374
I was shocked.

1206
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,492
If they told me I was going
to be a father at twenty three

1207
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:51,849
I don't know
what I'd do.

1208
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,335
Well, I don't think
it would be such a big deal.

1209
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:56,379
I mean, wow!

1210
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,854
What about Laura?

1211
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,970
You didn't run into her?

1212
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,331
You are all about Laura lately.
Is she your favorite in-law?

1213
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,449
I'm sorry, but we broke up.

1214
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:06,411
No, I mean...

1215
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:10,451
...I liked her, I always thought
she was cool. That's all.

1216
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:16,416
Her mother is crazy.

1217
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,736
Well, all parents are crazy.

1218
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,852
Just imagine
what she must think of ours.

1219
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:26,099
No, you don't get it. Her mom
is on another level of crazy.

1220
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:27,850
She is deranged.

1221
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:33,137
So, do you
want to go back already?

1222
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,055
Is it obvious?

1223
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:37,055
No...

1224
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,978
...but I mean,
you do live there now.

1225
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,576
- Yeah--
- I, for one, miss my apartment.

1226
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:42,930
Maybe.

1227
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:47,890
And you?

1228
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,090
Are you going back?

1229
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:51,530
Will you stay there?

1230
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,810
I'm not sure.

1231
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,132
Sometimes I think about
moving back here.

1232
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,454
But, you know, things can be
pretty boring here.

1233
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:08,095
It all depends. Maybe if I would meet
someone here I would stay.

1234
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,130
Right.

1235
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,331
Hi, Manuel!

1236
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:14,370
How are you, Juancito?

1237
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,776
- I'm good!
- I'm here to pick up something for my mom.

1238
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,369
- Yes, that would be your lunch.
- Yeah.

1239
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,094
Hey, your dad is in the back.
Do you want to come in?

1240
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,416
No... No, I'm good.

1241
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,417
I'm in a hurry, it's okay.

1242
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:33,971
Oh, yum.

1243
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:35,934
Hey, you know what?

1244
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,777
We need a picture
of the six of you there.

1245
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,609
- Yes.
- Don't you agree?

1246
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,219
You might be right.

1247
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,854
That's a good idea!
A good idea indeed.

1248
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,776
How are you, son?

1249
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,289
- Hi.
- We could take the photo at the party.

1250
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,297
- Sure.
- That would be nice.

1251
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,570
I'm glad you came.
I want to show you something.

1252
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,691
Okay.
I'll leave this here for a second.

1253
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,177
This is what I was
telling you about:

1254
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,178
Humidity. Humidity. Humidity.

1255
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,418
That spot is new
and I think it is getting bigger.

1256
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,817
Also, everything looks very deteriorated.

1257
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:18,012
I think we could
use this as an opportunity...

1258
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,374
...to renovate the entire shop.

1259
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,173
We make it better, more modern.

1260
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,938
- Yeah...
- Are you up for it?

1261
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,451
Up for what?

1262
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,890
What do you mean?
For you to do it, son!

1263
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,499
You mean
I would do the renovation?

1264
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,019
But of course! Who else?

1265
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,653
No, dad, no...

1266
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,131
...I don't do renovations.

1267
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:38,332
I prefer to do things from the ground up.
To start from zero.

1268
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:40,133
Oh, you only take ground-up projects?

1269
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,532
But renovations are
an important part of your career, son.

1270
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:46,209
Yes, but...

1271
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,977
...to be honest, what you call “modern"
to me is outdated.

1272
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,331
This placed should be demolished
so we could start over.

1273
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:57,454
I would go for something
more contemporary, you know?

1274
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,412
A cool, New York vibe.

1275
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,099
Very Italian, but cool.

1276
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,175
Oh, okay.

1277
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,218
Fine, whatever you say.

1278
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,980
If a client comes in
and offers you a job like this,

1279
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,420
you should take it, son.

1280
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:13,249
Because you will have to
earn a living somehow.

1281
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,894
You will have to earn
your daily bread somehow.

1282
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,454
Why don't we have a talk now?

1283
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,809
Didn't you want to talk to me?

1284
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:22,410
About how I don't love you,
was that it? Let's talk.

1285
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,372
- Now you want to talk?
- Yes.

1286
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,173
- Should we do this or not?
- OK.

1287
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,371
I'm tired, dad.

1288
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,219
I'm tired of being
the black sheep of the family.

1289
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,813
You are always pointing out my mistakes.
All the time...

1290
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:40,490
I mean, I think you do that
because I am gay.

1291
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,894
Because I like men.

1292
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,654
That's not true, son.

1293
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,100
- Oh, no?
- No, it's not true.

1294
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:48,814
I don't care what you choose
or what you want--

1295
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,932
But it's not a matter of choice.
It's what I feel.

1296
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,212
That's fine.
I'm not worried about that.

1297
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:58,492
I just want you to be happy, son.
And you don't look happy.

1298
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,380
That worries me.

1299
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,213
I want you to be happy.

1300
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,179
I just offered you the chance
of doing a renovation,

1301
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,053
something related to your career.
And you turn it down?

1302
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,853
You look down on it?

1303
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,654
I don't kid, I'm worried
life will pass you by...

1304
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,293
...while you try to become someone.

1305
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,651
I want you to do something that
makes you happy and earns you a living.

1306
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,851
But something you enjoy doing, kid.

1307
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,099
Something that makes you happy.

1308
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,774
And you? Are you happy?

1309
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,897
Is this your passion?

1310
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:35,810
Look, I put a lot of effort
into everything I did.

1311
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,170
I put my heart and soul into his, okay?

1312
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,860
And no one ever offered me
a renovation.

1313
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:44,815
That's not true. You are wrong.
What you're saying is not true.

1314
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,576
Hi! What are you up to?

1315
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,535
How are you, Luisito?
How's it going?

1316
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,458
- I'm good, you?
- Fine.

1317
01:10:56,980 --> 01:10:59,290
Listen, why don't you go to...

1318
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,537
...just grab the car and...

1319
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:05,454
-...and pick up the kids from school, OK?
- Sure.

1320
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,570
Thanks.

1321
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,338
Do you want to come with me?

1322
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:13,298
Yes, I have to do
a couple of things... but OK.

1323
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:19,416
Mom.

1324
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:20,896
Manu!

1325
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,380
Did you go see your dad?

1326
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,174
- Yes.
- And?

1327
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:26,938
And I talked to him.
And how did it go?

1328
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,778
Did he tell you about the renovation?

1329
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,369
Oh, I would love you to do it, honey.
It would be great.

1330
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:38,700
Oh, honey, I'm so happy
the six of us are all together!

1331
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,813
Having my four puppies home.

1332
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,370
I'm very happy-

1333
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,013
- Mom--
- I'm so into this!

1334
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,653
I really got into gardening.

1335
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,656
It is a new thing.

1336
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,249
I don't know if I told you already,
I can't remember.

1337
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:53,613
I can't remember what I tell you and
what I don't anymore, but I'm so excited.

1338
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:54,969
It's very soothing, you know?

1339
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,410
I met a woman who does
the most amazing things.

1340
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,497
You would die if you saw them! Really!

1341
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,055
It's funny because her name is Rose,

1342
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,775
-and she teaches a group of women that--
- Mom, listen to me.

1343
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:09,614
Yes, son, I'm listening.

1344
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,340
You're acting weird.
What's up?

1345
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,178
I'm not acting weird!
I'm not okay.

1346
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,371
I'm not okay because I'm not okay
with you guys, alright? I need you.

1347
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,818
My boyfriend dumped me and
I haven't talked to you since Christmas!

1348
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,534
Well, we are not okay either.
I already told you, Manuel.

1349
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,220
Stop bringing that up!
Enough, goddammit!

1350
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,571
But dad told me
he has no issue with “that”.

1351
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,656
He told me he only cares about my future,
my happiness, my career.

1352
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:36,694
My asshole boyfriend dumps me
the minute I get to Mercedes--

1353
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,858
I care about your future too!
I care a lot!

1354
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,778
I do, a lot.

1355
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,177
But let me tell you about Maximo.
That's what I need to talk about!

1356
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,655
I have already accepted you, son...

1357
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:51,217
I already told you. I do.

1358
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,050
But I can't handle it.

1359
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:01,136
I can't handle you telling me
what you do in bed. Please don't tell me!

1360
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:04,537
Mom, I don't want to talk about sex.
I want to talk about love.

1361
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:07,573
Love? Did you say love?

1362
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,059
Love is what I feel for your dad.
What he feels for me.

1363
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:13,330
Love is a family project.
That is love!

1364
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,736
You are insane.
Are you hearing yourself right now?

1365
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,178
What about
what you are doing to Luis?

1366
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,769
Not telling him he's going
to be a father? Is that love?

1367
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,052
I beg of you... Shut up, Manuel.

1368
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,770
Please, son, don't say a word
of this to anyone.

1369
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:30,650
Son!

1370
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,092
- Martin.
- Manuel, how are you?

1371
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,416
I'm good, and you?
Were you waiting for me?

1372
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:14,056
Uhm, yes... I felt like seeing you
so I decided to wait for you.

1373
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:15,136
Alright then.

1374
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:17,335
Are you OK?

1375
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,255
Not really.

1376
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:21,219
- Do you want to come in?
- Yes.

1377
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:22,978
- I'd like that.
- Come on.

1378
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,618
- After you.
- Thanks.

1379
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,810
I'm so sick. Everything's a mess.

1380
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:42,136
Really? It's that bad?

1381
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:43,819
Well, don't worry.
You are here now.

1382
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,055
It's over, OK?

1383
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:47,297
- Yes, but you know what? I feel--
- What?

1384
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,570
- I feel my parents are never gonna change.
- Uh-huh?

1385
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,055
Yes. They don't even try to accept me.

1386
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:54,933
- But my brother can do no wrong...
- Yeah?

1387
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:56,539
I mean, he knocks up his girlfriend

1388
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,937
and it's no big deal: they pay for her
medical insurance and that's it.

1389
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,933
My dad is suddenly
worried about my future.

1390
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,050
What is up with them?

1391
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,418
Well, who knows.

1392
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,411
Look, do you know
what the important thing is?

1393
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,656
That you make yourself clear.

1394
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:18,096
If you are uncomfortable here you have to
go to the city where you are okay

1395
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:21,497
and they will come to you
and you will mend your relationship.

1396
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,133
- OK?
- Oh, that's easy to say.

1397
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,649
- What if they don't come?
- Then they are not worth it.

1398
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,529
Here's the deal:

1399
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,539
There's a three-year period, okay?

1400
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,378
That's what they say.
Three years.

1401
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:40,497
If in three years they don't accept you
then they never will.

1402
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,013
So? What do I do?

1403
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:44,576
What do you mean?

1404
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,976
I have a lot of time left
before that but...

1405
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,934
...if I leave I won't see anymore.

1406
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,011
No way, you will see me...

1407
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,460
...we can still see each other.

1408
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:56,254
The important thing here
is that you are well, okay?

1409
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,773
That you are well.

1410
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,573
But that's enough
about parents for now, okay?

1411
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,699
Can you think of something else?

1412
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,936
Or better yet, don't think.

1413
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:08,576
<i>Had to leave. Had a great time.
Thanks!</i>

1414
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,096
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

1415
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:37,096
Is Laura home?

1416
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,415
<i>It's me. Who is it?</i>

1417
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,132
It's Manuel.

1418
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,978
<i>Manuel... I can't talk to you.</i>

1419
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:43,250
My brother is in town.
We need to tell him.

1420
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:46,213
<i>I know he is here.
I'm not telling him.</i>

1421
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:47,656
Laura, please.

1422
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:51,933
He is a good person, he will take care
of his child and it will be for the best.

1423
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,733
My parents don't realize that.

1424
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,009
<i>Goodbye, Manuel.</i>

1425
01:17:58,460 --> 01:17:59,859
<i>Manuel, have!</i>

1426
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,332
Laura, I beg of you!
Don't be a bad mother!

1427
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,019
<i>Leave or I will call the police.</i>

1428
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,175
Laura!

1429
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:01,655
<i>Manuel, is that you?</i>

1430
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:05,418
Son, where were you?

1431
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,491
I didn't sleep here.

1432
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,452
I won't explain myself.
I don't live here.

1433
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,856
Okay, okay...
I don't want to fight.

1434
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,337
I'm your mother. You are home.

1435
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:17,135
You didn't come home.
I was worried, that's all.

1436
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,457
Next time just give me heads-up.

1437
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,254
- Okay, fine.
- Alright.

1438
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:25,019
Look, I was just trying out
the dress for the party.

1439
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,335
What do you think?

1440
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:30,772
- Is it too much black with the shoes?
- No, you look nice mom, I like it.

1441
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,379
- You do?
- Yes, it's nice.

1442
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,537
I have to go to the salon
and do so many things.

1443
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,537
- I don't know why I'm doing this...
- No.

1444
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:41,336
I can't seem to enjoy this, I swear.
I can't enjoy you, or Luisito.

1445
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,736
- I can't...
- Hey, calm down.

1446
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,891
You are celebrating 25 years of marriage.
OK, that's not common.

1447
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:51,377
So enjoy it.
Take this chance to treat yourself.

1448
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,772
Just think if it weren't for this,
Luisito and I wouldn't be here.

1449
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,698
Yes... that's true.

1450
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,136
I'm sorry.

1451
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,009
Forgive me, son.

1452
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,816
I'm sorry if I said something
that upset you.

1453
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,574
It's a sensitive subject.

1454
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,500
And you know me...

1455
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:22,496
I get very...
I say things without thinking.

1456
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:25,851
Mom...

1457
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,211
Relax, OK?

1458
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,816
I know this is very hard for you.

1459
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:37,169
I get it, really, but
I also need you to understand me.

1460
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:43,329
It's a process,
but I want us to go through it together.

1461
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,177
Hey, it will be OK.

1462
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:48,651
OK?

1463
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,858
But I want you
to promise me something.

1464
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:56,731
What?

1465
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,417
That you will solve
this issue with Luisito.

1466
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,093
Mom, what you are doing is not normal.

1467
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,654
Okay, I promise.

1468
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:11,374
It got out of our hands!

1469
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,897
I can't imagine what will happen
if your brother finds out.

1470
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,775
Relax.

1471
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,491
- Did you see my parents?
- No.

1472
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:50,570
Thank you.

1473
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,611
No! Mine has alcohol in it.

1474
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,538
Fine...
This sucks.

1475
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,977
"This sucks?" How old are you?

1476
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,572
We have to celebrate.
Celebrating is good.

1477
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,011
What do you want me to celebrate?
This is so boring.

1478
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,416
- Hey punk, what's new with you?
- What do you mean?

1479
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,692
- What are you going to study?
- Oh... It's always the same with you all.

1480
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,378
Turns out you are just
like mom and dad.

1481
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,537
- No, well...
- You can't talk about anything else.

1482
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,731
What do you want me to ask?
You never talk to me.

1483
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:19,089
You laze around all day...

1484
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,978
- Fag.
- Asshole.

1485
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,772
- Hey, have you seen mom and dad?
- No, why?

1486
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:28,540
Don't tell me they are
going to make an entrance, please.

1487
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:30,412
No, why would they make an entrance?

1488
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:32,338
They are arriving late
to their own party.

1489
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:33,734
Whatever...

1490
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:34,736
Why are you drinking?

1491
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,659
- You are going to get smashed.
- It's just that I'm hungry!

1492
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,654
Okay, I will go into the kitchen
to see what's going on.

1493
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,773
Can you get me something?
Some cheese and bread?

1494
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,015
I will see what they got.

1495
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:49,611
Dora!

1496
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:51,496
How's it going?

1497
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,257
Bad.

1498
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,333
We are missing
half of the ingredients,

1499
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,576
the food is not here
and they are just told me...

1500
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,010
Please, we need to do something Dora.
This is a mess.

1501
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,858
We run out of food,
I can't believe it.

1502
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,129
Did you just figure it out?

1503
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:03,534
We need to solve this, Dora.

1504
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,573
Should I send for some of our pasta
so we can serve some pots?

1505
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:11,217
Goddammit! I hired a catering service
especially to avoid sewing pasta.

1506
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,854
- Can you believe this?
- Relax, dad. I got this.

1507
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,493
Dora, what ingredients do we have?

1508
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,418
- We will figure it out.
- We got this...

1509
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:16,934
I love this!

1510
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,290
It's delicious.
You have a talent for this, kid.

1511
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:22,738
You should do this for a living.

1512
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,416
- You think?
- Absolutely.

1513
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:28,009
It was a pretty basic thing, though.

1514
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:32,012
We had tomato, bread and arugula,
so I made some bruschettas.

1515
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,050
Well, I wouldn't have thought of it.

1516
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,454
I mean it, son.

1517
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:39,333
You saved us.
Tonight, you saved us.

1518
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,419
- I'm going to say hi to Lore.
- Sure.

1519
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,336
Lore!

1520
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,417
Hi Martin, this is Manu.

1521
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,818
I'm fine, I'm at the party.
It's a big boring but it's okay.

1522
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,618
Do you want to meet up later?

1523
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,410
Oh... OK.

1524
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,018
Don't worry, it's okay, really.

1525
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,814
See you later. Bye.

1526
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:39,898
Well, let's toast to my daughter,
Clara and her husband, Luis.

1527
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,336
It's wonderful to celebrate as a family.

1528
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,609
Thank you, mom.

1529
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:48,254
Thank you, Mom.

1530
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:52,613
I want to extend our toast to my kids,

1531
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:56,975
especially my son Luisito,

1532
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,852
who came back especially

1533
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:02,291
to share this night
which is so important to us.

1534
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,933
I'm delighted you are here.

1535
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,730
Thank you, dad.

1536
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,056
Your father is right.

1537
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:11,536
It must be hard being away from us all.

1538
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,772
I also want to make a toast.

1539
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,811
Here's to Facu, Clari and me.

1540
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,536
At the end of the day,
we're also your kids.

1541
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,856
Excuse me everyone,
I forgot about our star.

1542
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:26,294
He can't help himself.
He just has to be the star of the night.

1543
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:30,129
My son, Manuel, prepared
those delicious things you are eating.

1544
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:34,857
He might never build skyscrapers,
but he sure can make appetizers.

1545
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:37,779
Ok honey, this is not the place
or time for that joke, okay?

1546
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:39,299
- Here's to...
- I'm not joking.

1547
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,138
Here's to Luisito.

1548
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:42,580
I toast you.

1549
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,611
I toast my kids.

1550
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,489
I'm also your son, dad!

1551
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:47,849
<i>'QM...
"Skim!</i>

1552
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:50,538
I'm you son,
whether you like it or not.

1553
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:56,056
And I think we should also toast
the achievements of my brothers and me.

1554
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,693
Did you say achievements?

1555
01:26:57,980 --> 01:26:59,698
Here's to our kids.

1556
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:01,411
No.

1557
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:05,017
No, I'm sorry
but he has no right to do this to us.

1558
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:08,451
Luis, here's to my kids.
Because they are our family.

1559
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:11,049
Mom is right.

1560
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,213
Let's toast the family.

1561
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:16,215
Why don't we also toast
the new member of our family?

1562
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,694
Shut up, Manuel.

1563
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:20,130
- Here's...
- Shut it, Manuel.

1564
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,612
...to Luisito and Laura's baby.

1565
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,577
Who will be born soon.

1566
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:28,134
He is making us all...

1567
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,814
...aunts, uncles
and grandparents!

1568
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,657
What?

1569
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:36,215
Shut up, dude!

1570
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:40,411
Dad?

1571
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,533
- What was that?
- I just blurted it out.

1572
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:47,219
You can't just blurt that out!

1573
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:49,411
I know but, did you see
how dad was bullying me?

1574
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,530
So that's your excuse?

1575
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:52,936
I'm sorry! It was the first thing
that came to mind!

1576
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,255
He is going to kill me.

1577
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,734
He will kill me...

1578
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,851
- You hate me, right?
- No, why would I hate you?

1579
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:00,051
No, this is not about you!
This is about them.

1580
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:01,497
I'm sorry...

1581
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:02,769
Did you know about this?

1582
01:28:03,340 --> 01:28:04,216
I'm sorry.

1583
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,657
- He is going to hate us.
- Come on, hurry up.

1584
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,296
Hey, brother.

1585
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,818
We wanted to know
how you were doing.

1586
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,895
How do you think I am?

1587
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,215
I don't get you!

1588
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:30,170
I don't get any of you.
Least of all mom and dad.

1589
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,497
- You seem to be all against me!
- No, we are not against you!

1590
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:36,690
I mean...

1591
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,419
...I did what I had to do.

1592
01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,538
You needed to know what was going on.

1593
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,853
Yes, don't be mad at Manu.

1594
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:47,373
You need to understand us too.

1595
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,810
You come here and suddenly
you are the perfect son.

1596
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,774
You needed to know.

1597
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:55,052
It wasn't the time or the place, but...

1598
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:57,896
-...would you rather not know?
- You guys hate me.

1599
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,340
- No
- No!

1600
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:02,256
I hate what mom and dad do to you.

1601
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:06,331
They point out my every mistake
but you are the perfect son.

1602
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:09,774
But...

1603
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,858
...that's not my fault anymore, Manu.

1604
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:14,215
That's on them.

1605
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,854
Yes, you are right but...

1606
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:19,973
...by making those differences
they pit us against each other.

1607
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:23,576
And personally,
I don't like feeling that way.

1608
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,330
Okay. Thanks.

1609
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,294
So, what are you going to do?

1610
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,860
Right now I don't know.

1611
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,415
I want to see Laura.

1612
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,249
- I think that would be good.
- Yes.

1613
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,340
I also want to go back to Spain
and see what happens there.

1614
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:55,254
You still have time
to make up your mind, relax.

1615
01:29:58,220 --> 01:29:59,699
Oh baby brother, relax.

1616
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:02,691
I'm sorry.

1617
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,580
I was wrong,
I shouldn't have spoken back there.

1618
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,020
I'm truly sorry.

1619
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:13,410
I'm not OK.
I'm going through a rough time...

1620
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,537
...and I ended up hurting you all.

1621
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,417
I apologize to the both of you.

1622
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:26,416
I'm sorry too.

1623
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:31,177
I needed to know this somehow.

1624
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,572
And it's good to know
you don't hate me.

1625
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:36,134
How could we ever hate you?

1626
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,217
You could come home
more often, that's all.

1627
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,576
- And bring chocolates as a present.
- Oh, you are so right!

1628
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,811
What are you doing up there?
Please, get down.

1629
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,090
No! I'm sick of you two, dad!

1630
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:52,338
Oh guys, please come down!

1631
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,973
So you can keep on shouting at us?

1632
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:57,500
Wait a minute. We're coming.

1633
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,291
Guys...

1634
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:01,538
- What?
- It's over. Let's go down.

1635
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:02,931
It's over.

1636
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:05,495
Let's not make more of a spectacle
of ourselves.

1637
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:11,490
<i>Yes, who is this?</i>

1638
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:12,371
It's Manu.

1639
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,016
What's up?

1640
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:22,170
Are you busy?

1641
01:31:22,660 --> 01:31:23,411
Yes...

1642
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:25,372
Yes... a little.

1643
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,135
Can I come in?

1644
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:29,575
I'm busy.

1645
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:33,696
OK. It's fine, I get it.

1646
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:36,449
I wanted to tell you
I'm leaving first thing tomorrow.

1647
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,253
- Oh!
- So, I wanted...

1648
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,339
...I wanted to see you
and spend the night together.

1649
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,450
Oh...

1650
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:44,533
Uhm, I...

1651
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:46,811
I can't right now.
It's impossible, no.

1652
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:49,134
- Oh. ..
- I can't.

1653
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,299
I really can't...

1654
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:52,899
But hey! Well...

1655
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,934
-...I'm sure we'll meet again.
- OK.

1656
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,571
- I hope you have a safe trip back.
- Okay.

1657
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,849
Hey, wait up!

1658
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:03,534
- What?
- What is wrong with you?

1659
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,411
Come again?

1660
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:07,578
I told you I'm leaving tomorrow
and you are just going to let me go?

1661
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,816
I mean... don't you care about me?

1662
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,130
Excuse me?

1663
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,177
Dude, I'm telling you
I'm leaving tomorrow,

1664
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,735
that we might not see each other
for who knows how long

1665
01:32:16,860 --> 01:32:18,612
and you don't care.
You just let me go.

1666
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:20,139
You won't ask me what happened,

1667
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:22,649
if something happened
to me or my family...

1668
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,691
I mean, what is wrong with you?

1669
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,535
Lower your voice.

1670
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:28,695
Uhm...

1671
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,729
There's nothing is wrong with me...

1672
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:35,458
I think you are very confused, Manu.

1673
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:38,535
Everything's fine.

1674
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:39,491
More than okay.

1675
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,736
We had a great time...

1676
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:46,051
...but that's all.
Nothing more.

1677
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:47,490
So that's it?

1678
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,973
Yes, that's it.

1679
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,935
Have a safe trip.

1680
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:42,856
Manuel!

1681
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:45,929
That damn alarm!

1682
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:46,777
What happened?

1683
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,892
We set it because we thought
you were inside the house.

1684
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,854
- I want to get out of here!
- No!

1685
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:55,539
I'm sorry, dad.
I'm sorry about today, really...

1686
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,571
No, kid, why are you apologizing?

1687
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,019
I'm sorry I'm a fag.

1688
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:02,250
I'm sorry.

1689
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,210
No, son!

1690
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:09,540
I have fought against it all my life.

1691
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:12,090
I needed...

1692
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,218
...I needed to accept myself but...

1693
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:19,172
...all I really cared about
was that you hear it from me.

1694
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:23,009
So it would be okay.
So you wouldn't suffer.

1695
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:29,450
We... we love you, son.

1696
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:34,180
Me and your mom, we screwed up
a lot of things, didn't we?

1697
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:38,776
I'm sorry.

1698
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:43,936
The thing that upsets me
is that sometimes you're not happy.

1699
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,698
You don't seem to be happy.

1700
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,409
I want you to be happy.

1701
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:54,251
I feel like I'm running away
all the time and I'm tired.

1702
01:34:54,380 --> 01:34:55,415
I'm exhausted.

1703
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,896
You are very brave, honey.

1704
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,772
You are so brave.

1705
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:01,699
I can't do this anymore, mom.

1706
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,534
Remember when you were a kid
and you came to the factory?

1707
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:18,889
You used to love it!

1708
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,740
Then you decided to be an architect.
What happened, huh?

1709
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,932
I always wanted to be like you, dad.

1710
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:28,777
Always.

1711
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:33,532
Choosing Architecture was an excuse.

1712
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:39,772
To get away, to run away.
I don't know, but I'm tired.

1713
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,970
I'm tired of running away.

1714
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,977
I want to be happy here,
with both of you.

1715
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,294
- Yes, honey. Yes.
- I want to be near you.

1716
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:49,330
Yes, of course, my dear son.

1717
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:50,777
And...

1718
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,329
...and so it will be.

1719
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:53,810
And so it will be.

1720
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,010
I love you both.

1721
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:58,095
We love you too.

1722
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:59,096
We love you.
