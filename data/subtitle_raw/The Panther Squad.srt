1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,360
It
 fills the streets.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,230
With one eye open.

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,690
It never sleeps.

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,560
She's got it loaded.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,300
Always ready.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,640
She's not afraid.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,020
Yeah, she holds it real steady.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,980
She won't run away.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,030
She won't run away from
 the wolf in the night.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,530
Run away.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,030
She won't run away.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,330
She's tough and
 tender, does it right.

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,030
Ungh.

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:01:01,080
Always moving, like
 a shadow hard to see.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:09,570
When she finds you, like a
 knife, she'll cut so deep.

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,330
She's got a heart
 full of passion.

17
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,780
Won't break in the
 heat of the action.

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,220
She won't run away.

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:27,130
She won't run away from
 the wolf in the night.

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,570
Run away.

21
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,030
She won't run away.

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,950
She's tough and
 tender, does it right.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,380
She's tough and tender.

24
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,350
She's tough and tender.

25
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,820
She does it right.

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,730
She's tough and tender.

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,470
She's tough and tender.

28
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,170
Yeah.

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,130
Whoo.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,600
Run away, run away.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,090
She won't run.

32
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,070
Run away, run away.

33
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,550
She won't run away.

34
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,040
She's tough and tender.

35
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,010
Run away, run away.

36
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,000
She's tough and tender.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,260
Run away, run away.

38
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:17,970
Yeah.

39
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,950
She's tough and tender.

40
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,860
She'll make you crazy.

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,340
You wanna love her.

42
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,800
Like a magnet, you
 want, you want.

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,260
She won't run away.

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,720
She won't run away from
 the wolf in the night.

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,690
Run away.

46
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,170
She won't run away.

47
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,140
She's tough and
 tender, does it right.

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,630
Run away.

49
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,610
She won't run.

50
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,100
Run away.

51
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,080
She's tough, tough and tender.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,560
Run away.

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Run away.

54
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,040
She won't run.

55
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,630
The
 following program is

56
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,480
brought to you by NOON, the
 New Organization of Nations.

57
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,700
Your
 attention, please.

58
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,200
The president of NOON, the
 New Organization of Nations,

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,550
is about to announce an event
 of the utmost importance.

60
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:43,290
Citizens of the world, as you
 all know, the letters N-O-O-N,

61
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,630
NOON, stand for the New
 Organization of Nations and are

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,340
the symbol for the rise of
 mankind, which has now reached

63
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,650
the high noon of its destiny--

64
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,270
conquest of space.

65
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,390
Therefore, all
 nations of the world,

66
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,320
with the exception of
 a few small islands,

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,590
cozy and sunbathed republics,
 have resolved to enter together

68
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,280
into the new age of space,
 which will bring peace

69
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,610
and prosperity to all nations.

70
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,600
This has only become possible
 through the invention

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,450
of a totally new means of
 interspatial communication.

72
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,360
It's called the Space
 Jeep and has just been

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,950
launched on its first voyage.

74
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,550
After the successful completion
 of this first test flight--

75
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,920
This is a message
 from Clean Space,

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,590
the anti-pollution commando.

77
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,720
The voice you're
 now listening to

78
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,440
is being broadcast worldwide
 from our ultra-secret space

79
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,110
transmission center.

80
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,740
We have lost our fight against
 pollution of the earth.

81
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,030
We shall win our fight
 against pollution of space.

82
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,690
Your Space Jeep is
 therefore under our control

83
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:38,240
and will remain so as long as
 you do not meet our demands.

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,940
Clean Space requires
 the cancellation

85
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,570
of the entire space program.

86
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,830
Remember, your pilot
 and the Space Jeep

87
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,130
are from now on in the
 hands of our technicians.

88
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,120
Get me Space Center, quick.

89
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,080
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,780
Hi, Fred.

91
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,400
Listen, we've got to
 change Sam's trajectory.

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,310
What?

93
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,440
Sir, that's out of the question.

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,340
Changing trajectory
 means changing orbit.

95
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,390
Nothing doing.

96
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,350
Don't argue.

97
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,220
That's an order!

98
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,330
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,200
Henry?

100
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,320
Yeah?

101
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,110
Start up number three,
 slow, and move from H to six.

102
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,290
Got it?

103
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,240
Yeah.

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,130
But if you ask me, you're
 gonna blow up the whole thing.

105
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,980
You heard what the man said.

106
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,020
Orders.

107
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,740
OK, OK.

108
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,510
You're the boss, I'm the wiz.

109
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,470
I just hope you know
 what you're doing.

110
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,170
Here we go.

111
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,520
Three, normal.

112
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,770
H six plus three.

113
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,730
Overheating on the first.

114
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,010
Trajectory?

115
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,060
Unchanged.

116
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,230
H six, danger point.

117
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,860
Back to four.

118
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,280
Temperature of the
 cooling system?

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,560
208.

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,520
H six on to five.

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,530
Temperature?

122
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,380
220.

123
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,570
Four everywhere.

124
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,180
Six minus plus five.

125
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,150
Five minus plus four.

126
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,240
We're locked on four.

127
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,940
Temperature?

128
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,230
220.

129
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,280
Move H to infinity.

130
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,980
Impossible.

131
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,180
Saturation of the module.

132
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,500
Temperature?

133
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,690
225.

134
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,110
Back to three.

135
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,100
Well, Mr. Nelson, we
 can't do anything now.

136
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,950
Our signals are being reflected.

137
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,610
We'll try to shut the circuits.

138
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,250
OK, try it.

139
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,020
Get me Brussels.

140
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,430
Training center?

141
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,020
No, not the training
 center, headquarters.

142
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,790
Mr. Barrot.

143
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,420
Yes, Nelson?

144
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,210
Sure, I know.

145
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,720
The president's
 address was worldwide--

146
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,430
and so was the ultimatum.

147
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,390
They're bluffing.

148
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,560
I doubt it.

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,210
I've given orders for a test.

150
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,130
They're trying right now
 to change the trajectory

151
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,510
of the Space Jeep.

152
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,930
Hold on.

153
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,860
Shit!

154
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,350
Well, keep trying!

155
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,010
That's what I'm doing.

156
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,490
Cut number one.

157
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,560
Connect to three
 block in parallel.

158
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,240
Well, it's no bluff.

159
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,310
Our signals keep
 coming right back.

160
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,330
All circuits broken.

161
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,620
Locked in free thrust.

162
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,100
How the hell did they do that?

163
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,900
Let's try again.

164
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,010
All right, if you say so.

165
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,020
But remember, if we
 bust that module,

166
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,460
the whole thing blows up.

167
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,470
All this crap to please
 that damn Nelson, huh?

168
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,230
Not quite.

169
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,410
Remember, there's a guy up
 there in that Space Jeep

170
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,460
spinning round and round.

171
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,180
What they do have is
 probably a magnetic barrage

172
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,420
against outgoing signals, same
 kind as their TV interference.

173
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,880
It blots out anything
 we try to send out

174
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,690
and gets anything
 they want on the air.

175
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,850
That's the story.

176
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,650
So what can we do?

177
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,110
We've got a spare
 one ready for launch.

178
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,160
Ah, you mean that girl, uh,
 Jane Dantine, Sam's stand-in?

179
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,950
Sure, fine-- uh, that is if
 she can take off right away.

180
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,390
Sure.

181
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,300
She's as good as he is.

182
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,640
They were both trained together.

183
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,370
Barrot, remember, she needs
 protection, for those Clean

184
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,110
Space characters.

185
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,130
All right.

186
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,760
Don't worry, I'll
 pick her up myself

187
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,660
and bring her to the plane.

188
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,300
Put on 305.

189
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,790
Would you please get
 my own car ready?

190
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,230
And please rush a security
 car over to the center.

191
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,140
NOON
 security car number 27,

192
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,680
go straight to the
 training center

193
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,350
to meet Mr. Barrot and
 astronaut Jane Dantine

194
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,630
and escort them to the airport.

195
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,100
Car number 27?

196
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,940
Gotcha, kid.

197
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,910
We're on our way.

198
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,780
Hey, what's this?

199
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,240
An accident.

200
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,940
Jesus.

201
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,360
Come over here, will you?

202
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,110
I have a date with
 some cute astronaut,

203
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,310
and we're going to be late.

204
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,970
Bah!

205
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,390
Hurry!

206
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,500
We gotta pick up the astronaut
 before Barrot gets there.

207
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,890
Oh, uh, Mr. Barrot
 couldn't make it.

208
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,960
He sent us to drive Miss
 Dantine to the airport.

209
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,050
Well, let's go.

210
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,210
Where's Dantine?

211
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,210
She's gone already.

212
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:33,910
What?

213
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,380
Get me to the airport, quick.

214
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,180
This is a message from
 the organization Clean

215
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,110
Space, space without pollution.

216
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,810
You are already aware
 of our preventing

217
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,760
your signals from watching
 your so-called Space Jeep.

218
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,690
We know that without those
 signals, your man in space

219
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,820
will remain in orbit forever.

220
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,180
We also know that
 only one other person

221
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,800
able to pilot your spare
 Jeep is presently our guest

222
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,800
and will remain with us
 as long as necessary.

223
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,460
But we are not murderers.

224
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,990
On the contrary, we want to
 save the world from pollution.

225
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,350
All you have to
 do to save them is

226
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,100
to cancel your space program.

227
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,500
End of message.

228
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,030
Find a way to get this
 cassette to General Boele.

229
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,030
And now, boys, we
 are going to Guasura.

230
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,660
I'm telling you, it's
 right here on the cassette.

231
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,000
Jane kidnapped, tied to
 a chair, and poor Barrot

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,440
killed on the road.

233
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,120
Well, if they want
 to play it rough.

234
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,710
We figured the exact site
 of Jane's disappearance

235
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,280
at Ostend Harbor.

236
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,970
An abandoned ambulance
 we found there two

237
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,140
days ago fits the description--

238
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,030
We'll play it even rougher.

239
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm gonna send you the
 toughest cookie in our job.

240
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,490
Dammit!

241
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Run away.

242
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,190
Just be at the airport
 when she arrives.

243
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,660
I'll get you the exact flight
 number and the time, OK?

244
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,680
I'll
 send her an official car.

245
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,930
No, no, you don't have
 to send an official car.

246
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,230
What this lady has, you
 wouldn't want to camouflage.

247
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,070
All she needs is a chauffeur,
 on time, at the airport.

248
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,360
You see, this lady gets
 into action real fast.

249
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,330
A boat called Lord Byron
 left Ostend yesterday.

250
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,790
Don't know where
 it was headed for.

251
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,790
The owner is a woman.

252
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,160
Before leaving, she did
 some heavy recruiting

253
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,820
around the harbor.

254
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,180
Wander around, you
 could learn some stuff.

255
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,760
Here's her name.

256
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,600
Barbara Wims.

257
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,110
Anything else I can do for you?

258
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,810
No, thanks.

259
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,200
That's all.

260
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,110
Excuse me, sir, but is there
 the slightest chance you know--

261
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,860
Hey, you two up there.

262
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,690
Yes, you.

263
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,020
I'm looking for a boat that
 probably has a big sign on it

264
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,990
with the name "Lord Byron."

265
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,250
I got it.

266
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,090
Hello.

267
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,130
I'm a friend of Barbara.

268
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,330
Is she here?

269
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,350
Do you know where she is?

270
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,370
I have a message for her.

271
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,240
It's very important that she
 gets it as soon as possible.

272
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,480
Make sure that she gets it, OK?

273
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,930
Ugh!

274
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,630
Uh!

275
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,430
Oh!

276
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,130
Ugh!

277
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,720
Ah!

278
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,420
Ugh!

279
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,380
Ugh!

280
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,080
Ah!

281
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,210
See anything around here?

282
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,140
Hmm, Ramirez.

283
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,710
Probably one of
 Barbara's clowns.

284
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,520
Coteras, Guasura.

285
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,400
Our local operative's
 a real dynamo.

286
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,930
There aren't many
 like him anymore.

287
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,880
Frank Randall is his name.

288
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,410
Wait till you see him in action.

289
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,950
Now, we all know how
 dangerous this operation is.

290
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,110
He's the one with
 that little surprise

291
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,610
package we spoke about.

292
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,600
But remember, only to
 be used in emergency--

293
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,750
a last resort.

294
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,700
I'll keep
 my eyes open for the package.

295
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,630
You keep your ears
 open for the good news.

296
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,090
Here's Randall's
 address in Guasura.

297
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,460
3 Plaza Mayor, Coteras.

298
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,820
Time for action.

299
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,950
Nelson's agent's coming to you.

300
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,520
Well, I didn't expect to
 see anything quite so lovely

301
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,180
this time of the morning.

302
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,840
Uh, you here for
 the sun and the fun?

303
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,330
No, I'm here for the action.

304
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,820
Frank?

305
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,780
Yeah, I think so.

306
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,650
Ilona.

307
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,940
Beautiful name,
 beautifully lady.

308
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,710
Won't you come in?

309
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,730
You know, this a
 pretty rough place.

310
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,530
Do you think you can take all
 these characters around here?

311
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:59,170
Ah, the last of the macho men.

312
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,360
No, beautiful women
 are my favorite pastime.

313
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,020
Like collecting
 butterflies, huh?

314
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,720
Anna-Lea.

315
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,110
She's my bodyguard.

316
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,650
You want one?

317
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,830
Root beer on the rocks.

318
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,190
Now, uh, did you receive
 a diplomatic pouch

319
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,910
with my name on it?

320
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,410
No, I only get junk
 mail around here.

321
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,360
It's hot stuff, so when
 it does come, get it to me.

322
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,910
Sure.

323
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,140
So, que pasa?

324
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,840
Nada.

325
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,260
Nothing.

326
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,080
Oh, yeah, I got an
 address on Ramirez.

327
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,560
He runs a dive down
 by the waterfront.

328
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,520
Hmm.

329
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,630
Anchors away.

330
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,450
Aye aye, sir, or miss, or--

331
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,460
Don't shoot!

332
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,830
Ah!

333
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,840
I want her alive!

334
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,670
Ah!

335
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,160
Ah, let go of me!

336
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,950
Ow!

337
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,650
No!

338
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,300
Everything's cool.

339
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,860
Oh, lovely, you
 came incognito.

340
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,330
I said it was a rough
 place down here.

341
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,320
Rough trade.

342
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,140
Fear not, lovely ladies, I have
 solid contacts, so after you.

343
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,070
You sure they
 don't know you here?

344
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,920
Just a lucky guess.

345
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,000
My contact should be
 around here someplace.

346
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,120
I think that's him.

347
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,670
That's him?

348
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,270
Yeah, the one with the
 Julio Iglesias haircut.

349
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,540
You keep the bartender busy.

350
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,240
When duty calls.

351
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,670
The boat--

352
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,520
Lord Byron-- uh--

353
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,460
the boat--

354
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,800
If you wanna fight,
 fight, don't talk.

355
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,100
You want a date, right?

356
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,800
Ugh!

357
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,200
What'd he say?

358
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,390
He's bilingual.

359
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,540
Well, he mentioned
 something else about a boat--

360
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,700
Lord Byron.

361
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,890
Oh, Lord Byron, ah.

362
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,010
Yankee, go home.

363
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,260
Wrong game.

364
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,340
I play football.

365
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,040
Oh, you do?

366
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,580
What position?

367
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,550
What else?

368
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,840
Kicker.

369
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,540
Ugh!

370
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,450
Be back in a minute.

371
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Fear not, eh?

372
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,270
Well, I told them not to
 drink the worms in that stuff.

373
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,100
Let's get out of here.

374
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,040
Let's get to the airport.

375
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,740
Hey, wait a minute.

376
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,060
I have to call my mother
 and buy a toothbrush.

377
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,410
Do you think we should
 have children right away?

378
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,510
You know, this is
 awfully sudden.

379
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,490
This is not an
 escape, it's an arrival.

380
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,260
Ah, you're
 expecting something.

381
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,670
Six somethings.

382
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,100
Sensibility reigns.

383
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,470
Six phantom jets?

384
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,230
No.

385
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,810
Six attack choppers?

386
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,510
No.

387
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,560
Six Gremlins?

388
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,370
No.

389
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,470
Six girls.

390
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,370
Aha.

391
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,850
What next, special cavalry?

392
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,550
Missed.

393
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:06,760
Oh, look, the Dallas
 Cowboys must be in town.

394
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,310
Right league, wrong team.

395
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,640
This is the Panther Squad.

396
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,300
And this is Frank,
 our man in Guasura.

397
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,210
Claims he works for the consul.

398
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,620
Say hello to Frank.

399
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,000
Hello, Mr. Frank.

400
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,510
Dumpy, Grumpy,
 Slumpy, and Sleazy.

401
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,950
Do they do windows too?

402
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,970
No, they jump through them,
 and they shoot through them,

403
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,570
but they don't clean them.

404
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,220
Well, you can't
 have everything.

405
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,190
Come on, girls,
 here's the minibus.

406
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,760
OK, girls, we're dealing
 here with a circus.

407
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,960
Their main stunt was to kidnap
 one of NOON's top astronauts.

408
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,020
They're real clowns.

409
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:12,790
But since they won't live up
 to your idol, Tom Selleck,

410
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,060
I'll know where you are nights.

411
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,570
The astronaut is
 probably being held

412
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,010
on a boat around the harbor.

413
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,770
We'll hit first
 thing in the morning.

414
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,410
Today, just relax, and
 welcome to sunny Guasura.

415
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,450
Oh, an oasis.

416
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,760
Who's in a rush?

417
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,570
It's great.

418
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,190
Let's go for a swim.

419
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,950
Oh, yes.

420
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,070
Oh, yeah.

421
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,440
Oh, I'm tired.

422
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,140
Come on.

423
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,250
Beats watching
 football, doesn't it?

424
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,190
Yeah, it's, uh,
 great while it lasts.

425
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,610
Meaning what?

426
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:10,580
Oh, Antonio and his
 friends can get nasty.

427
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,850
"The Empire
 Strikes Back," eh?

428
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,190
Hmm.

429
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:15,890
Shaky.

430
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,240
5% nerves, 90% liquor.

431
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,750
And you are 100% correct.

432
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,850
Like one?

433
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,640
Root beer.

434
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,960
So, uh, when should we
 expect the trouble to begin?

435
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,660
Ooh.

436
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,510
Tomorrow.

437
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,020
The next day.

438
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,850
Things move pretty
 slow around here.

439
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,530
Ugh!

440
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,500
Help!

441
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,200
Ah!

442
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,090
All right, recess is over.

443
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,390
All right!

444
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:29,720
You and you stand watch,
 the others hit the sack.

445
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,970
And get your power sleep.

446
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,450
Ah!

447
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,300
Was it good for you too?

448
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:50,060
Thanks for cleaning up that
 mess that burned on the lawn

449
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,080
yesterday.

450
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,870
Oh, and, um, did you see which
 way the young ladies went?

451
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:58,360
No, but they mentioned
 about called, uh, Lord Byron.

452
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,030
Frank Randall?

453
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,190
Sometime.

454
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,100
Sign here.

455
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,220
Who's it from, Max Factor?

456
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,920
From the consul.

457
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,970
These guys are red hot.

458
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,770
You can bring in
 our ace swimmers.

459
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,050
Yah!

460
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:06,750
Yah!

461
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,090
Oh, boy, goodie.

462
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,600
Playmates.

463
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,680
You'll get front page.

464
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,240
Now that you had
 your warm up, take the Jeep

465
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,890
and keep your eyes
 on that truck.

466
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,650
I'll catch you later.

467
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,290
There's a roadblock further
 up according to the map.

468
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,680
See any way we could avoid it?

469
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,190
All right,
 ladies, take a hike.

470
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,230
I'll handle the roadblock.

471
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,810
Maybe, but let's be prepared.

472
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:02,920
I want to take all
 the precautions I can.

473
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,690
And I want police dogs too.

474
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,230
But everything is quiet.

475
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:11,990
I've got news.

476
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,970
They're having
 trouble on the yacht.

477
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,260
The two guys keeping
 watch have been attacked.

478
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:16,960
Shit.

479
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,240
But the women who did
 it have been captured.

480
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,950
Get them up here fast.

481
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,060
They're coming.

482
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,350
I got a call from the truck.

483
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,280
Good.

484
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,380
I wonder why they use women.

485
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,760
It worries me.

486
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,560
Why?

487
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,840
On the contrary.

488
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,140
It will give our
 men an incentive.

489
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,330
Maybe.

490
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,100
I'll double the number
 of guys, just in case.

491
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,730
Don't overdo it.

492
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,850
We're in control, so relax.

493
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,440
Still, I'd like to warn
 the boys on the road.

494
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,800
Don't.

495
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,700
No one knows that Jane is here.

496
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:50,020
There is no point to start
 those mercenaries guessing.

497
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,930
All we want them
 to do is to check

498
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:53,410
the cars on the road, period.

499
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,410
Uh, I'm a tourist.

500
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,420
Would you please take
 some photos with me

501
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,540
and your friends as a souvenir?

502
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,480
You're from the Lord Byron?

503
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,520
Yes.

504
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,220
Come on.

505
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,230
If you want to starve
 yourself to death, go ahead.

506
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,680
We need you away from the
 space center, dead or alive.

507
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,350
A hunger strike will
 not free you earlier.

508
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,700
Earlier than what?

509
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,950
You'll be free as soon as
 the New Organization of Nations

510
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,990
accepts cancellation of the
 entire New Space Program.

511
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,790
You must be joking.

512
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,110
They never will.

513
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:52,290
Meaning that you will stay
 with us for a long, long time.

514
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,270
To keep you
 company, Miss Dantine.

515
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,240
Jane Dantine, we'll
 get you out of this.

516
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,780
Shut up!

517
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,310
We need some
 discipline around here.

518
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:12,530
Bullseye.

519
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:21,150
The insects are bad here,
 but we'll need more than Raid

520
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,230
to kill off that pest.

521
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,540
OK, divide and conquer.

522
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,720
You, you, you, to the
 bar, and you go get nosy.

523
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,020
You with me, come on.

524
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,250
Ugh!

525
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,940
Cover that door.

526
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,910
Ugh!

527
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,390
Ah!

528
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,680
Ah!

529
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,380
Ah!

530
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,280
Ugh!

531
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,150
Ugh!

532
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,070
Let's get out of here!

533
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,050
What about them?

534
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,020
Shoot them!

535
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,000
Ugh!

536
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,480
Oh!

537
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,400
What took you so long, huh?

538
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,240
They finally have
 us under attack.

539
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,100
Everybody to the fort.

540
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,450
They're gone!

541
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,440
They took Jane.

542
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,920
Let's go!

543
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:15,960
Ugh!

544
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,000
Leaving
 without even a doggy bag?

545
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,480
Wah!

546
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,680
They went that
 way, didn't they?

547
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,680
Who?

548
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Come on!

549
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,990
That's the most relaxing
 drink I've had in a long time.

550
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,640
Barbara to
 Clean Space chopper.

551
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,710
Just finish up that red
 Jeep and what's inside.

552
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,930
Sounds like some
 big bird's watching us.

553
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,350
Chopper to Barbara.

554
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:15,390
We'll teach them what macho is.

555
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,300
Frank, get out!

556
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,700
Hey, boogie.

557
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,180
Frank, get down!

558
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,830
You think you
 might need some guns?

559
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,310
Yeah, and some bullets
 if you've got 'em.

560
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,010
OK.

561
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,990
Enough target practice.

562
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,760
Now down to business.

563
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,790
OK, first thing--

564
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,790
where are we, anyway?

565
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:29,990
At this point,
 all the roads lead

566
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,880
to the government headquarters.

567
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,290
There is one?

568
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,320
General Carlos, right there.

569
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,630
Ah.

570
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,330
OK.

571
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:41,700
Come on, girls, we're gonna
 make a special delivery.

572
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,060
Special delivery--
 hey, wait a minute.

573
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,060
I forgot your gift.

574
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,560
How long have you had this?

575
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,840
Let's go.

576
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,760
Me too?

577
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,460
You first.

578
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:37,100
And now let me
 express our gratitude

579
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,200
to Professor Fonestran.

580
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,180
Professor.

581
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,750
Professor Fonestran
 is a genius.

582
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:48,380
It is he who invented the
 magnetic barrage which prevents

583
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:52,130
the space centers of
 the world to communicate

584
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,500
with their stations in
 orbit, their satellites,

585
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,580
their astronauts!

586
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:00,690
The magnetic barrage originates
 in our own space center,

587
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,390
right here under the palace!

588
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,490
From there, we will
 dominate the world.

589
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:14,870
Only one device completes
 the magnetic route we

590
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,750
have built around the planet--

591
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:21,800
their new Space Jeep.

592
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,710
And only one person has
 been trained to operate it,

593
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,860
a woman called Jane Dantine.

594
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,970
Now, listen!

595
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:34,340
Jane Dantine is down
 below in our dungeons.

596
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,650
She's our prisoner!

597
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,040
Bravo!

598
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,510
Bravo!

599
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,460
Bravo!

600
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,920
Bravo!

601
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,390
Bravo!

602
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,830
Professor.

603
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,800
Bravo!

604
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,570
Bravo!

605
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,270
Bravo!

606
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,440
There is nothing and no
 one who can stop me now.

607
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,720
I will be the lord and
 master of the world.

608
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:20,510
The so-called great powers
 will be reduced to slavery!

609
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:25,400
You, my people, you, my
 faithful companions in arms,

610
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,960
you will rule the universe!

611
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,740
As president of Clean
 Space, and in the name

612
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,250
of my organization, I take
 issue with the declaration

613
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,360
you just made.

614
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,820
We have given you
 our support, and we

615
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,250
have given you our assets.

616
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,640
We offered to use our
 technological device

617
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,160
for the exclusive
 purpose of impeding

618
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,800
the pollution of space.

619
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,460
This way.

620
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:19,150
You have betrayed us.

621
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,240
I withdraw our support.

622
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,980
Take that stupid
 ass out of here.

623
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,480
I don't want to listen
 to all his nonsense.

624
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,420
You won't have to anymore.

625
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,250
No one will-- ever.

626
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:51,080
Soldiers, friends,
 companions in arms!

627
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:05,260
Today we celebrate
 the dawn of a new era.

628
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:10,030
There was the age
 of the Roman Empire.

629
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,570
Today begins a new age--

630
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:15,520
the age of the Guasura!

631
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,990
Wine for everybody!

632
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,850
You, get high, this
 way around the back.

633
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:40,820
You go with me.

634
01:02:12,490 --> 01:02:13,190
Ugh!

635
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:14,940
Ooh!

636
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:15,940
Ah!

637
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,690
Surrender or I'll
 blow your Nikes off.

638
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,160
Come on, girls.

639
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,480
Let's show 'em how to party.

640
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,130
You stay here.

641
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,870
The odds are only 40 to 1.

642
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,400
General!

643
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:54,630
There is nothing
 to worry about.

644
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,670
I know what I'll do.

645
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:59,650
Blow your brain
 cells, probably.

646
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:03,090
I'll blow up the
 world if necessary.

647
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,740
These trans-magnetic
 rays are powerful enough

648
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:08,140
to interfere with
 worldwide television

649
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:12,640
and prevent all outgoing
 rays from reaching space.

650
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,130
I can set off an explosion
 in any nuclear power plant.

651
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:19,800
There are hundreds of
 them around the world.

652
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:25,320
I know how to do it, right
 here from our space center.

653
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,660
We'll go there right now and
 take Jane Dantine as a hostage.

654
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,360
Come on.

655
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:35,320
Buck.

656
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:39,950
Hurry up.

657
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,730
We are taking her as a hostage.

658
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:42,430
Yeah.

659
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,380
General.

660
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,840
However fantastic your
 plan happens to be,

661
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,120
it can only harm mankind.

662
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,930
But you will fail.

663
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,940
That will teach
 you, you moron.

664
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,690
You must destroy--

665
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:30,800
destroy-- destroy
 the space center.

666
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,120
They fooled us.

667
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:35,330
Their space
 transmission center--

668
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,610
they want to destroy the world.

669
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:42,560
They can do it from their
 space transmission center.

670
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:45,670
You must get there before.

671
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,180
You must destroy the generator.

672
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,030
Destroy it.

673
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:53,790
Go now, quick.

674
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:57,700
We've been fooled all along.

675
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,990
Go.

676
01:06:58,990 --> 01:06:59,690
Go.

677
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,160
Come on!

678
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:38,690
Get the others.

679
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:00,530
Drop that gun!

680
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,020
You just take care
 of the astronaut.

681
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:13,000
You son of a bitch!

682
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,530
CLEAN SPACE PRESIDENT
 You must destroy--

683
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:18,710
destroy-- destroy
 the space center.

684
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:32,660
You must destroy the generator.

685
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,630
Only to
 be used in case of emergency--

686
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:26,690
a last resort.

687
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,230
CLEAN SPACE PRESIDENT
 Destroy.

688
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,350
I need a drink.

689
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,360
Citizens of the world,

690
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,600
after an incident of no great
 importance which slightly

691
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,830
delayed the launching
 of our space program,

692
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,410
it will now proceed as planned.

693
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:42,020
A few seconds from now, you will
 be watching on this same screen

694
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:48,290
the take-off of Jane Dantine
 piloting our second Space Jeep.

695
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:16,740
Mankind's new age
 of space has begun.
