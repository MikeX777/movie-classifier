Your pilot is here,

47
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,250
Welcome to Palestine Plaza
Hotel.

48
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,708
What is your name?

49
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,208
Your army's

50
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,458
Are they planning
to visit us?

51
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,875
They will find me.

52
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:44,125
Then they will
destroy this place.

53
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,416
It is already destroyed.

64
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,375
Segaya.

65
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,583

66
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,833
What is
your name?

67
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,000
You don't understand?

68
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,750
Your name?

69
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,791
You bombed here

70
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,541
I don't know.

71
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,958
Where is

72
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,208
Where are we?

73
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,875
Who is Alana--

74
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:15,083
- This her?
- Give me that.

75
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,291
She your wife?

76
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,333
Give me that.

77
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,541
She has
biggest ass.

78
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,000
She look like a cow.

79
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,875
Why don't you
shut up?

80
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,541
What this say?

81
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,166
Toilet.

82
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,416
Take me to the
toilet, please.

83
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,666
Hey!

84
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,541
What?

85
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,333
What it is?

86
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,375
Your map is
not right.

87
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,791
That is Israel.

88
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,041
Your brain is not right.
It's "Falestine."

89
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,875
There is no Falestine.

90
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,458
There are Palestinians.

91
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,166
And when we go home,
we make it Falestine again.

92
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,375
Who will go?

93
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,541
Him and me.

94
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,875
We go down this way,
in from here.

95
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:31,416
I come too?

96
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:33,791
You'll never get
past the border.

97
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,208
The fences are ten meters high.

98
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,416
We climb them.

99
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,666
They're electrified.

100
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,166
We dig under
them.

101
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,541
They're built on solid rock.

102
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,708
Swim around them!

103
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,958
You are
not coming.

104
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,291
Yes, I am and so is
Churchill!

105
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:53,250
You're taking
the dog?

106
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,250
It's Palestinian dog.

107
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,583
The border guards
have dogs this big.

108
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,750
They will eat your Palestinian
half-breed for breakfast.

109
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:30,000
Pele.

110
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,791
Let me out.

111
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,875
I'll take you with me.

112
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,833
I can get you in.

113
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,166
You and your
Palestinian dog.

114
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:46,958
Stay in your cage.

115
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,750
Fucking
terrorists.

116
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,500
We must kill all
the terrorists.

117
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,625
Put it down!

118
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,250
I said put
it down!

119
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:19,875
Put it down or
I'll break his neck.

120
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,750
Put it down.

121
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,416
Now get
the keys.

122
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,583
Get me the keys!

123
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,708
Do it!

124
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,833
Please.

125
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:39,958
Please
leave him.

126
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,125
He's my only brother.

127
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,458
That little
fucker.

128
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,291
He's crazy.

129
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,333
I want
a doctor.

130
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,916
I need a doctor,
you understand?

131
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,041
Relax.

132
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,250
I am a doctor.

133
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,958
You will be fine.

134
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,041
Just let me
do my work.

135
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,958
Is he your son?

136
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,333
He's
a good boy.

137
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,875
Move that thing away,
you fucker.

138
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:23,791
Shh!

139
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:26,000
I'll free you!

140
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,083
What?

141
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,375
Get me past border.

142
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:32,666
Make deal.

143
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,375
What deal?

144
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:37,833
You say you'll take me to
border if I free you, no?

145
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,208
Yes or no?

146
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,583
Yes.

147
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,625
Okay.

148
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:53,958
Deal.

149
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,166
You put clothes now.

150
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,333
This way.

151
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,166
Come, we make shortcut.

152
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,250
The American embassy.

153
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,666
You know
where it is?

154
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,375
We are going to border.

155
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,958
No, you take me
to the embassy now.

156
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,333
You are taking me to--

157
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,250
You do what
I say.

158
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,458
You understand?

159
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,583
Now get up!

160
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:16,000
Get up!

00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,375

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,791

00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,250
Don't swallow it!

165
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,000

166
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:30,000
Shit!

167
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,125
Stupid.

168
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:32,958
Stupid boy.

169
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,833
Can't --

00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:41,250
Come here!

171
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:50,625
How do you say,
"American Embassy Please"?

172
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,958
How do you say it?

173
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,791
How do you say it?

174
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,083
How do you say,
"Have a nice day?"

175
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:14,583
Okay.

176
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,291
You American?

177
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,750
Yes.

178
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,833
American.

179
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,791
Take me to
the embassy, please.

180
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,166
North Beirut is closed from,
pssh, pssh, shooting.

181
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,291
You go tomorrow.

182

No, I need

183
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:17,750
You have a problem, sir?

184
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:18,958

Aboudi drive taxi long time.

186
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,333
There's nothing Aboudi no
see before.

187
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,458
Oh, you get a Lebanon
girl pregnant.

188
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,375
And her brother

189
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,083
You steal something?

190
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:33,083
Kill somebody?

191
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,916
Come on, man,

192
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:36,041
The border.

Looking for this?

381
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,541
Fahed: You come on
American F-16.

382
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:53,041
You go back
on Falestinian F-16.

383
01:09:00,458 --> 01:09:03,833
What this say--

384
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:06,000
"Boy."

385
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,958
- Boy or girl?
- Boy.

386
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,083
You no make boy.

387
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,958
Shut up.

388
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,666
I only make
boy.

389
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,666
Will he be in
Air Force, too?

390
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:19,166
You don't choose
the Air Force.

391
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:22,833
The Air Force chooses you.

392
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,791
What?

393
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:27,958
"The best to the
Air Force."

394
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,958
Are you in trouble
for crashing plane?

395
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I didn't crash it.

396
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:35,375
There was nothing
I could do.

397
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:38,000
How it feel to jump out?

398
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:42,958
It knocks your balls up your
nose.

399
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,250
Will they make
you pay?

400
01:09:44,291 --> 01:09:45,458
No.

401
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,916
So who will pay?

402
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:52,791
The Americans.

403
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:53,958
Come on,
boy.

404
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,208
Come on-- good donkey.

405
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:06,208
How do you piss?

406

Hmm?

408
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:12,875
Use a bottle or
a pouch.

409
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:15,958
Or, you know.

410
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,083
A diaper.

411
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:22,166
I have never used it,
okay?

412
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,041
It's a short trip.

413
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:26,916
I go in, do my
mission and go home.

414
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,416
Go over here.

418

419

You want to play?

420
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,791
Let's see
what you've got.

421
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,083
Oh, not bad.

422

Not bad?

423
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,958
You call Ziko
not bad?

424
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,750
Go, go!

425
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:01,125
Ah, he's going
for the gold!

426
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:14,791
Stop!

427
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:16,541
Fahed, stop!

428
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,958
Don't move!

429
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,541
Do not move!

430

You understand
where we are?

433

It's a minefield.

434
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:54,541
A little movement
can set it off.

435
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,041
What the hell is
wrong with you?

436
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:03,625
What did I just say?

437
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:04,791
I not care,
I want my tree--

438
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:06,041
Hey, it's just a tree.

439
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,208
Forget it.

440
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,750
No, I want my tree!

441
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,291
Okay,
okay.

442
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:20,625
I'll get it.

443
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:52,333
Crazy kid.

You are Ziko,

462
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:29,875
Platini is my favorite.

463
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:31,291
You know him?

464
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,208
Okay.

465

they are your size.

466

I'll get someone to
take you to the shower.

Can he guarantee Fahed's
safety, after what he did?

Can he do this?

474

Then I'm not
sending him back.

That's Lieutenant Leclair.

482

She's with Una.

would happen.
