00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,533
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

163
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,907
Why don't you people go to work?

164
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,480
Haven't any of you got jobs?

165
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:25,541
Oh, come on!
We better hurry. We're late now.

166
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,120
Twice already this week
I've been late...

167
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,680
and I don't want any additional
difficulty with Mr. Reisman.

168
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,761
- Come on.
- What if he should jump?

169
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,330
What if we left now,
and he really jumped?

170
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,059
We would still be late to Mr. Reisman.

171
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,295
The important thing with Mr. Reisman
is punctuality.

172
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,270
With him, punctuality is a principle.

173
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,672
Gee, he doesn't look very old.

174
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,438
I wonder what—
what kind of trouble he's in...

175
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,004
<i>what made him so bitter.</i>

176
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,415
Maybe—
Maybe someone was cruel to him...

177
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,114
or maybe he's just lonely.

178
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,886
I suppose you could decide to kill yourself
if you were just lonely enough.

179
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,121
Oh, come on. Let's go!

180
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,424
I— No, I can't.

181
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,231
I wish I could help him.

182
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,736
It's the worst thing in the world
to be lonely.

183
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,307
There must be hundreds of people
like that in New York—

184
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,376
lonely and desperate.

185
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,445
Why don't the police do something?

186
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,844
I heard they can't get hold of him.

187
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,416
Every time they get close,
he says he'll jump.

188
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,644
Excuse me.
I was speaking to my friend.

189
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:36,086
- She left. She had to go to work.
- Oh.

190
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,993
Well, would you like a mint?

191
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,288
Cinnamon flavor.

192
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,194
No, thank you.
I don't think we're acquainted.

193
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,175
If you're upset about anything,
I'd like to help you.

194
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,580
<i>I'd like to talk to you.</i>

195
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,512
Where's the cop?

196
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:07,076
- Cop?
<i>- Yeah. The one that was up here first.</i>

197
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,815
Which one?

198
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,118
I don't want to talk to anybody else.

199
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,592
Will you come in
if we let you talk to him?

200
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,990
I'll have him up here right away.

201
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,036
- Do you know who he means?
- The flatfoot that boxed the report and came up.

202
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,700
- Let's get him.
- What's he want to talk to him for?

203
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,109
What does it matter
as long as he talks?

204
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,546
If he'll unload his troubles on somebody,
we've got a chance to get him in.

205
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,777
Maybe our only chance.
Let's get him.

206
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,853
- What was his name?
- I don't know, Chief.

207
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,821
Find out. Check. See who boxed in.
Get him up here on the double.

208
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,892
- All right.
- He's probably working the street.

209
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,621
- You get a description on the air?
- Sure. I sent it downstairs.

210
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,629
All right.

211
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,700
- Hey, fella.
<i>- [Woman Screams]</i>

212
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,133
We'll have your friend
up here in a minute.

213
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,117
[Announcer]
He appears to be about 23 years of age.

214
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,745
He's wearing neatly pressed gray flannels
and a white shirt.

215
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:19,053
He has brown eyes, wavy brown hair.

216
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:24,426
He's about five feet, nine inches tall
and weighs about 155 pounds.

217
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,431
This is extremely important.

218
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,697
If you recognize this man,
call Spring-7-3-100.

219
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,796
From your description, that's
Charlie Dunnigan, all right. Traffic "A."

220
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,637
Okay. Moksar wants him right away.
Find him and get him up there.

221
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,268
- Right. You men know him?
- Yes, sir. We'll get him.

222
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,712
This is George Putnam speaking,
ladies and gentlemen.

223
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:48,584
The speed with which this crowd
has gathered is absolutely amazing.

224
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,214
<i>People on all sides of us—
thousands of them.</i>

225
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,623
It's impossible to estimate from our point
of vantage down here on the street...

226
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,628
exactly how many people are here...

227
00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:00,291
<i>galvanized, held spellbound
by the breathtaking spectacle...</i>

228
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,062
of a young, unidentified man
perched on a ledge...

229
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,138
<i>15 stories above the street.</i>

230
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,639
I'm gonna turn you over to Bob Roberts now,
who's at a window across the street.

231
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,642
How does it look from up there, Bob?

232
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,771
There's not much happening right now.
There seems to be some sort of delay.

233
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,840
The man we have just identified for you
as... Deputy Chief Moksar...

234
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,887
comes to the window at intervals,
says something...

235
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,650
but, of course, from this distance,
we can't tell what he says.

236
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:28,125
The boy appears cool and detached,
just waiting.

237
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,130
He's thinking about something.
Perhaps reviewing his life.

238
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,668
At moments he teeters precariously
on the edge of this ledge...

239
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,431
calmly looking down
into the abyss below.

240
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,507
- What is he thinking?
- Miss Kelly, will you turn that off, please?

241
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,576
- Yes.
- Try Mr. Fuller again.

242
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:47,613
[Volume Down] Can he somehow be persuaded
that his life is not entirely worthless?

243
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,046
Considering the shortness of time...

244
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,516
perhaps we should proceed
without him.

245
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:58,087
- Mrs. Fuller?
- Yes?

246
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,126
I've worked out
the disposition of the children...

247
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,696
<i>with Mr. Fuller's attorney.</i>

248
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:07,255
<i>Let's run through it once
while we wait.</i>

249
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:11,462
<i>"The above entitled action,
having been brought on by plaintiff...</i>

250
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,539
<i>for judgment of divorce"—</i>

251
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,609
- Stay here, folks. Clear one side, please.
- The chief said—

252
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,679
Hold that elevator!
Moksar's been waitin' on you.

253
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,280
Wait a minute here.
Where are you going?

254
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,285
I'm the Reverend Dr. J.C. Parkinson,
the boy's pastor.

255
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,287
His parents have requested me to—

256
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,357
What church do you represent,
Doctor?

257
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:35,417
I work in faith and magnetism.
I saved 17 souls last year.

258
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:38,498
- Souls respond scientifically to prayer.
- That's fine. I know.

259
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,566
You better keep going here.
We're busy here.

260
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,658
Come back another day.
Good-bye.

261
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,431
So, right away I hear his voice,
I know something's screwy, see?

262
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,069
I figure he's up to something,
so I open the door careful, and I make a grab—

263
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:55,205
All right.
Clear it here, fellas. Clear it.

264
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,946
Hey, fella. What are you,
this joker's father or something?

265
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,786
- What'd you say to him?
- I don't know, Chief. I don't remember.

266
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,917
- First thing that came into my mind.
- Okay, okay.

267
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,724
<i>Whatever you did, do it again.
Let's get him in off there. Come on.</i>

268
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,299
Sorry, Chief, but I don't know
what you want me to do.

269
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,369
You got to him. He loves ya.
He won't talk to anybody else.

270
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,438
He doesn't like me. He doesn't like
these big brain specialists, so you're it.

271
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,007
- I'm puttin' it up to you.
- Look, this is a little out of my line.

272
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,236
- I don't know anything about loopies.
- That's in your favor.

273
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,313
Just be natural with him.

274
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,382
We tried to be, but we're doctors...

275
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,950
and he's probably had
a bad experience with doctors.

276
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,384
He smelled us coming.
Just talk to him.

277
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,557
- What do I say?
- It doesn't matter. Anything.

278
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,024
Anything to sublimate his drive.

279
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,585
Easy, Doc. I took a little French,
but I didn't keep up with it.

280
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,600
Sorry. Break his stride,
spoil the momentum he's building up.

281
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,637
If you can make him talk,
he'll feel better and loosen up.

282
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,738
Is he a real loopy or is it an act?

283
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,109
Let's say he has a problem.

284
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,910
We can be sure of that
even if we don't know what it is.

285
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:07,885
And it seems enormous to him,
bigger than it is.

286
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:12,425
He's out there considering what seems to him
to be the only possible solution.

287
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,727
Come on.

288
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:36,042
<i>[Crowd Murmuring]</i>

289
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,391
How you doin', kid?

290
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,826
How you feel?

291
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,126
I—

292
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:56,930
I'm... holding up the parade, I guess.

293
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,996
[Chuckles]
Don't worry about that.

294
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,782
I... feel better now.

295
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:17,846
I—I can breathe better.

296
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,858
Swell!

297
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,928
It's gonna be a great parade.

298
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,996
You buy a shamrock?

299
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,327
Uh—

300
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,628
Are you Irish?

301
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,465
I mean, uh, Irish derivation.

302
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,698
I don't need any signs, huh?

303
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,038
Well, you don't have to be a harp
to wear green today. Everybody does it.

304
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,601
It's one of those things. Everybody gets
into the act. You feel good about it.

305
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:44,514
Hey, suppose I get the hotel
to fix us up a room on the backside...

306
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:48,075
and we can sit out like this
and see the parade.

307
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,986
How 'bout that?

308
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:56,722
N-No, I—
I've got to think this through.

309
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,798
Maybe I can help you.

310
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:03,662
I—I've got to think this through first...

311
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,136
b-by myself.

312
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,434
[Chuckles]

313
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,205
I'm s-sorry
about holding up the parade.

314
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,410
Most of 'em must be watching me.

315
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,612
They're all watching you.

316
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:26,359
What was it you wanted
to talk to me about, kid?

317
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:32,692
<i>You asked for me to come back, didn't you?
You sent for me.</i>

318
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,968
Why? Why'd you do that?

319
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,975
Everybody lies to me.

320
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:47,035
If you mean I didn't give you any bull,
that's okay. I appreciate that.

321
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,615
I'm not gonna try
and feed you any now either.

322
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,184
I haven't got the right kind
of kisser for it.

323
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,254
<i>I'll tell you this—

<i>I don't think

326
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:04,088
But you sent for me,
and I'm on orders.

327
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:08,566
I wanna help you. I think you oughta
tell me what it's all about though.

328
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,466
<i>If it's a girl,
I can tell you all about a gal—</i>

329
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,598
If you have to march or anything,
it's all right.

330
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,608
No, forget it.

331
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,440
I'd just as soon be up here with you.

332
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,784
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

333
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,658
Could I have a glass of water, please?

334
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,696
Sure thing. Anything you like.
Just speak up.

335
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,197
Uh, not too much ice in it.

336

too much ice in it in hotels.</i>

Sit tight. I'll be right back.

339
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,372
- Keep him busy.
- He wants a drink of ice water.

340
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,381
Water.

341
00:26:56,482 --> 00:27:00,351
If I can con him in closer, as he reaches
for the glass, I can make a grab for him.

342
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,889
- He'd yank you, then both of you'd go over.
- Not if somebody hung on to me.

343
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,890
He'd yank us all.

344
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:09,587
I don't mind losing you, but I don't want a whole
daisy chain of cops sailing out that window.

345
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:13,132
Why not put a rope on Dunnigan's leg,
then put beef on the rope into the hall...

346
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,360
just in case he gets a chance
to make a grab?

347
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,629
Okay. Get the rope.
Hey, where's that water?

348
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,706
Go on out there and stall
while I get you rigged up.

349
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,310
Hey, hey!
What do you think you're doin'?

350
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,709
Chief, I'd like to string up
this microphone by the window.

351
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,305
I want to catch that conversation
out on that ledge.

352
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,044
Get that screwball out of here, will ya?

353
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,678
- Get that gear out!
- Anything on those prints yet?

354
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,757
- Not a thing yet.
- What are they doing,
playing poker or something?

355
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,826
Put some heat on 'em!

00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,418
Come on, Barney.
What are you doin', bakin' a cake?

357
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,828
I sent down for some ice, kid.

358
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,400
I knew you wanted a little ice.

359
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,698
- Never mind.
- Ah, just take a second. Sit tight.

360
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,034
It just takes a little while.

361
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,108
I'll be right back.

362
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,386
That's fine.

363
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,047
Keep it up.
Just don't press him quite so hard.

364
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,125
If anything annoys him, skip it.

365
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,990
Keep talking.
He's beginning to relax.

366
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:19,690
I think he's getting a bang out of it,
big-shottin' it out there.

367
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,267
Whatever his problem is,
it paralyzed him.

368
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,666
He felt he couldn't do anything,
couldn't move.

369
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,103
Now he's out there. He's free.

370
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,665
He's got a choice.
He can jump at any moment or not jump.

371
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:34,736
He likes that feeling.
He feels important. He's a great guy.

372
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:39,216
- You see him teetering? Phew! Scares the living—
- You're all set, Dunnigan.

00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,219
Here.

00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,991

00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,432
Hey, Dunnigan. Does this guy go for dames?
If he does, I got an idea.

379
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,511
What are you talking to him about,
Dunnigan?

380
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,080
You think he's gonna jump this year,
or you think it's an act?

381
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,877
Look, you guys. If I get a chance,
I'm gonna make a grab for him.

382
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,316
- Keep your hands out of your pockets.
- Come on.

383
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,378
You get a hold of him, hang on. We'll pull
you back. You'll only fall a couple of stories.

385
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,087
- What's that?
- Stimulant.

386
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:26,461
It may pick him up a little,
raise his spirits.

387
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,761
It's worth a try anyway.

388
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:40,773

Not much ice, like you said.

00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:09,195
I was wrong to leave.
Of course I was wrong.

818
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:14,704
I didn't want to hurt you, but I just
couldn't stand the bickering...

819
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:16,865
the constant carping and complaining.

820
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,375
It got so I couldn't go home.

821
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:22,446
I hated the sight of her,
the sound of her voice—

822
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:25,715
Oh, I—

823
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,785
I didn't mean to say that.

824
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,188
If you ever say that again...

825
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:38,086
i-if you ever so much as touch her...

826
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:40,096
I'll kill you.

827
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:42,428
I'm sorry, Robert.

828
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,703
Really. I'm sorry.

<i>[Clanking]</i>

830
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:26,876
- Did you find out anything?
- The girl's name is Virginia Foster.

831
00:57:26,977 --> 00:57:29,879
They were kids in school together,
they were engaged, but it's busted up.

832
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,382
- Where is she now?
- She lives with her family
in Connecticut. Stamford.

833
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,385
Take us a couple of hours
to get her down here, even if we find her.

834
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,388
- What's the difference?
- Okay, okay. We might as well give it a try.

835
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:43,290
I'll put the pickup on her. You get out there
and keep your friend busy.

836
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:47,728
- We're gonna drop a man in a rig
and try to grab him.
- If he sees that, he'll dive.

837
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,857
See the commissioner about it.

838
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:55,171
- How'd you do?
- I got a line on the girl they're sending for.

839
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:57,400
- How is he?
- He's getting pretty confused.

840
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,238
You know what they're trying to do?
They're crazy!

841
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:02,506
I tried to talk them out of it.

842
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:05,582
Keep him from looking up.
That's all you can do.

You want a cigarette, kid?

846

No.

847

That looked like a pretty good thing
you had with Virginia, kid.

Why can't they leave me alone?

855
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:51,195
Why did they have to go and find out about her?
I didn't want her to know.

856

Can't they stop torturing me?

Yes. I don't understand it.

Are you serious?

- Yes.
<i>- Mrs. Fuller, may I ask—</i>

If you had been on time
it would have been all right.

I wanted to do it, but I got tired
of waiting and thinking.

holding their breath
to see what you're gonna do?

906
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,979

I'm sorry.

916
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:13,989
I—I could never talk to anybody
the way I've been able to talk to you.

917
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,549
I could never talk to my father

Don't you see your mother gave you
a wrong steer about your father, kid?

921
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:32,899
Don't you see he's really a good joe...

922
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,978
<i>and he likes you?</i>

923
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,248
I guess so. I—

I don't know.

925
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,412
I just don't know what to do.

926
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,389
He's right here. Why don't you
tell him you were wrong?

927
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:52,696
<i>Why don't you?</i>

928
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,300
Okay.

929
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,474
It's all right, Robert.

930
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,476
I understand.

931
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:11,480
I guess we both understand each other
a little better now.

932
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,880
Don't we?

933
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,952
Yes.

934
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:19,549
It doesn't matter anyway.

935
01:04:29,632 --> 01:04:33,000
Why don't you come on in
a little while?

936
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:36,005
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll make a deal with you.

<i>You've been out here
a long time now...</i>

938

<i>and it's pretty hot.</i>

01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:43,410
<i>You're tired,
and you haven't had anything to eat.</i>

940
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:45,744
I-I'll make a deal with you.

941
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:50,378
If you wanna come in and take a shower,
think things over...

942
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:54,515
I'll clear everybody out of the room,
give you the key and you can lock yourself in.

943
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:59,528
<i>And if you wanna come back out here...</i>

944
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,531
<i>okay, that'll be your own decision.</i>

945
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:08,194
How do I know that you'd do it?

946
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,205
Really?

947
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:14,141
Because I say so.
You got my word for it.

948
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:18,277
You'd didn't tell me
they were gonna try to grab me.

949
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,282
No, I didn't.

950
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,717
But I think that's a little bit different.
Don't you, kid?

951
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:27,484
You didn't ask me to promise
I wouldn't let 'em try to grab you.

952
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,027
Anyway, I couldn't have stopped 'em
if I'd wanted to.

953
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:33,596
This is just between us.

954
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:39,492
If I say so,
you've got my word for it.

955
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,575
All right.

956
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:50,177

983
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:19,056
He'll never believe me now,
no matter what I say to him.

984
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,468
Okay, check in.

985
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:32,241
You got any other ideas?

986
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:34,743
The girl.
Have we got anything on the girl?

987
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:38,440
No. If your captain gives you any trouble,
tell him to call me.

988
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:42,953
Yeah, he's still out there.

989
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,021
Yeah, I know.

990
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,490
What?

991
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,492
Well, where is she now?

992
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:53,995
- Can I get a Bayside number on this thing?
- Hold on. Yeah.

993
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:57,625
- That's the operator. Where's the chief?
- He's in there. Thanks.

994
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,996
Uh, Bayside-9-9-9-7-0.

995
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:04,870
Bayside-9-9-9-7-0.

996
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,034
Just a minute, sir.

997
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:11,414
Helen? I'm gonna be a little late.

998
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,141
Yeah.

999
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,516
Yeah. Are the kids there?

1000
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,416
Is Harry okay?

1001
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,561
I don't know. I still have to check in.

1002
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,257
- Hey. We got the girl.
- Wait a minute. What?

1003
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,266
We got the girl. They're flying her down.
You'd better stick around.

1004
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,269
Helen—I'll explain when I see ya.

1005
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,271
No, no, it's—

1006
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,273
It's okay. Go ahead without me.

1007
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:40,434
Save me a piece of liver.

1008
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:01,127
Darkness has transformed
this entire scene into—

1009
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,324
Well, it's a strange, fantastic sight.

1010
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:07,962
[ Reporter Continues] Many of these people
have been waiting here all day, and even now—

1011
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:10,631

01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,451

1017
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,366
Good.

1019
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,938
I'd like to talk to her first.

1020
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,751
- Virginia?
- Yes.

1021
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,753
Virginia, this is Dr. Straus.

1022
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:34,255
We'd like to talk to you a minute
about Robert.

1023
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:38,226
<i>[Reporter]
Give me a rewrite. She's in the hotel now.</i>

1024

Virginia.

1025
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:43,665
You were engaged.
Why did you break it off?

1026
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,667
I didn't. <i>He</i> did.

1027
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,669
He did? Why?

1028
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:51,366
Well, he—he just said
that he couldn't, that—

1029
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,670
that he'd make me unhappy,
it would be better—

1030
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,837
- Did you have a fight?
- No, but he'd get mad.

1031
01:11:56,946 --> 01:11:59,848
- What about?
- Whenever I tried to help him.

1032
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:04,478
Oh, he'd get in an argument and lose his job
and get sick—really sick.

1033
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,751
- I tried to get him to see a doctor, but—
- And he'd get mad about that?

1034
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:10,850
- Yes, even—
- Do you think you know what's wrong with him?

1035
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,055
We want you to talk to him, but first
we've got to be sure that you understand.

1036
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,598
- Oh, I couldn't. I can't.
- Don't you want to help him?

1037
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:18,668
- Oh, yes, I—
- We've failed.

1038
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:21,966
The least you can do for him is to try
to make him see that he's important to you.

1039
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,040
But what can I say?

1040
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:28,043
We've pieced together
a little bit about him today.

1041
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:31,308
Not everything. And it's complicated.
Partly, we're guessing.

1042
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:35,818
But it's an old pattern. It's been going on
as long as there have been families.

1043
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,319
His mother didn't want him, really.

1044
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:42,153
But she couldn't admit,
even to herself...

1045
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:47,094
that he'd spoiled her beautiful dream
of fame and fortune, a great career.

1046
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,097
So she babied him...

1047
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,828
and she couldn't admit,
again even to herself...

1048
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:55,632
that she blamed her husband
for trapping her.

1049
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:59,004
So she blamed him for everything else...

1050
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:02,738
and she got back at him
by teaching Robert to hate him.

1051
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,747
<i>All children— boys—</i>

1052

<i>are in love with their mothers
romantically.</i>

1053
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,288
<i>They get over it,
tend a little more toward their fathers.</i>

1054
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,722
Robert didn't. He couldn't.

1055
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:17,817
He hated his father.

1056
01:13:17,927 --> 01:13:21,921
<i>That bothered him.
He knew it was wrong.</i>

1057
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,865
<i>So he began to hate himself.</i>

1058
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:27,869
Everything proved that he was right—

1059
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:30,371
every time he lost a job.

1060
01:13:30,473 --> 01:13:33,204
The army said he was no good—
that made it official.

1061
01:13:33,309 --> 01:13:35,278
Do you love him?

1062
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:40,346
- Yes.
- Then tell him so.

1063
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:43,385
Make him believe it.
Help us to get him in.

1064
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:46,945
Then—It won't be easy...

1065
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:51,391
but then we'll do everything possible
to try to straighten him out.

1066
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,329
He wants to love you...

1067
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,331
but he feels unworthy.

1068
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,560
He's afraid to.

1069
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:00,637
Come on.

1070
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,743

01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,095
Robert.

1073
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:29,232
<i>Robert?</i>

1074
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,770
I told you, I—This doesn't have
anything to do with her.

1075
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:38,272
- I want to keep her out of it.
- Robert—

1076
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:40,673
I don't want her to see me.

1077
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,149
Robert...

1078
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,217
I love you.

1079
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,351
I need you and I want you.

1080
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:57,052
That's all. I won't ask you to do
anything you don't want to do.

01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,901
How big is it?

1084
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:13,067
Keep it out of his sight—
close to the building on the way in.

1085
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,077
Bring it up the elevator. We'll work it
with rope from the 13th floor.

1086
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,238
Yes, sir.

1087
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:23,081
Hug the building. Up the elevator—
13th floor. Stand by for Moksar.

1088
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:43,096
- W-What are they doing?
- Nothing, Robert.

1089
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,842
All right, here you go.
Watch it.

1090
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,853

1091
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:01,116
