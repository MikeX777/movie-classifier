1
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:36,262
FERDINANDO AND CAROLINA

2
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,332
<i>King Monster, tyrant,</i>

3
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,541
<i>King Rascal,</i>
<i>son of a bitch</i>

4
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:32,378
<i>Hal So, I've been told</i>

5
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,180
<i>I'm Ferdinando di Borbone,</i>
<i>King of N</i>a<i>ples,</i>

6
00:02:35,253 --> 00:02:38,620
<i>at the end of my long,</i>
<i>very messy reign.</i>

7
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:41,819
Nenn√©<i>,</i> come here.

8
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:51,327
- It smells good!
- That's hollyhock!

9
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:09,783
Are you crazy?
That's the King's bed!

10
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:18,595
- There's a church in his bedroom!
- No<i>,</i> that's a little chapel.

11
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:22,155
- Jesus! These are horns!
- Yes<i>,</i> horns.

12
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:27,900
- Horns under Saint Gennaro!
- So<i>,</i> horns under Saint Gennaro.

13
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:30,533
It's a Royal Family tradition.

14
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,907
Those<i>,</i> they are in a close relationship.

15
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:37,278
Do you want to know about
the King and Saint Gennaro?

16
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:40,841
When they're like this<i>,</i>
they're in peace.

17
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,117
And like this when they're fighting.

18
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,482
The King is terrible when he's angry!

19
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,859
- Doesn't Saint Gennaro get offended?
- Offended?

20
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,560
Why? Does the King get offended
when Saint Gennaro is angry?

21
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,799
Hurry up<i>,</i> now!

22
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,438
Go<i>,</i> get those flowers

23
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,411
and stop playing the coquette.

24
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:14,115
Get that basket.

25
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,454
Stop running!
Get over here!

26
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:39,900
- May I do something<i>,</i> Highness?
- Who's the girl?

27
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:43,414
My niece<i>,</i> fresh from the country.

28
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,971
Little babe.

29
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,647
<i>Those ass-kissing courtiers</i>
<i>even compliment my wife.</i>

30
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:54,886
- That's the King's second wife.
- Oh<i>,</i> the Queen!

31
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,691
- No. Morganatic wife.
- Mor... what?

32
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:02,326
Quiet! Look over there.

33
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,267
The King!

34
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:10,036
Ferdinando I of the Two Sicilies<i>,</i>
III of Sicily<i>,</i>

35
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:12,668
Ferdinando IV of Naples.

36
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:16,043
How many is he?
I don't understand!

37
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:19,379
Child<i>,</i> if you want to stay at Court<i>,</i>
you'd better wake up!

38
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,046
How many Sicilies are there?

39
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:26,215
It's only one<i>,</i>

40
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,317
but they say two.

41
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:32,955
He's King of both!

42
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:11,262
<i>I know... colitis.</i>

43
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:14,396
<i>I've always had a delicate stomach.</i>

44
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:48,569
Blessed Mother!
Help him<i>,</i> he's ill!

45
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,406
The King fainted! Let me pass!

46
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:54,638
Bring him to bed.

47
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,005
Sister<i>,</i> shouldn't we call a priest?

48
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:33,244
Majesty<i>,</i> religious comfort...

49
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:36,344
Should we call Father Raffaele?

50
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:42,620
Spell caster! I'm fine!
Get out of here!

51
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:46,323
If His Majesty sees Father Raffaele<i>,</i>

52
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:49,457
he'll have a stroke!

53
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:52,636
The priest!

54
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,811
It's shameful!

55
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:06,408
He needs a priest<i>,</i> not horns!

56
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:11,414
<i>I need my horns.</i>

57
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,514
<i>I don't want to think about death.</i>

58
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:16,617
<i>I want to think about Naples</i>
<i>when I was a boy, about the girls...</i>

59
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:20,095
Not death.

60
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:23,134
I want to think of what Naples was!

61
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,797
It was so beautiful...

62
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,973
when I was a boy.

63
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,568
We sang<i>,</i> we danced.

64
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:38,572
It was so beautiful...

65
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,086
He was beautiful as a prince!

66
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:48,254
They called me "Strawberry"
when I was a girl.

67
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,521
I was the caretaker's daughter

68
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:54,429
and we were just like this...

69
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,095
Then a Princess arrived.

70
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,808
But he liked us common folks.

71
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:10,109
He was a rascal prince<i>,</i>
a lively<i>,</i> happy kid.

72
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:13,275
<i>A Prince and good for nothing rascal</i>
<i>What more could I want? In Naples tool</i>

73
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,842
<i>Only one thing turns my stomach:</i>

74
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,683
<i>Maria Theresa of Austria,</i>

75
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,519
<i>the heaviest Empress in Europe</i>...

76
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:23,993
<i>130 kilos without her court dress.</i>

77
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:26,860
<i>I was still a kid when I knew</i>

78
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,991
<i>I'd marry one of her daughters.</i>

79
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:34,732
<i>She had a sea of them,</i>
<i>four or five.</i>

80
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,535
<i>Poor Emperor Franz.</i>

81
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:39,873
<i>That fatso dried him up</i>
<i>making babies for politics.</i>

82
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:43,903
<i>He looked like an asparagus,</i>
<i>and smallpox will get him sooner or later.</i>

83
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:48,112
<i>I'm afraid of only one thing:</i>
<i>Smallpox.</i>

84
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:51,519
<i>Why is the Empress so fixed on me?</i>

85
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:57,926
<i>She makes the Viennese Court</i>
<i>speak Italian.</i>

86
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:02,797
<i>Jesus, both the mother and her daughters</i>
<i>make my balls twist</i>

87
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,093
My darling Franz said<i>,</i>

88
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,038
"Theresa<i>,</i> you have
an important political head<i>,</i>

89
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:13,407
but your political belly
is even more important!"

90
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,547
My daughters are a blessing.

91
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:23,519
By using them
in the European chess game<i>,</i>

92
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:28,685
I want to assure an enduring peace.
Austrian peace.

93
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,959
The Mediterranean
is still the heart of Europe.

94
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:37,559
Phillip has done everything
to return Naples to Spain.

95
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:41,435
And we'll do everything
to make Naples Austrian.

96
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,167
That's your task<i>,</i>
Maria Giovanna.

97
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:46,904
Bring me the painting
of Ferdinando's Naples.

98
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:51,013
He's naked!
Franz<i>,</i> what are you doing?

99
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,647
My God...

100
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:13,403
- Do you like this place?
- Yes<i>,</i> Mother.

101
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:17,771
You must prepare
to become his queen.

102
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:21,903
- How is her Italian?
- Discreet<i>,</i> Majesty.

103
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:28,075
Prince Ferdinando will soon be King.

104
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:32,285
Sure<i>,</i> he's having a strict education.

105
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:36,054
He's surely been raised strictly
with rigid Spanish etiquette.

106
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:40,723
I imagine he's very cultured
and refined.

107
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:53,874
Hey<i>,</i> shit face!

108
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:05,617
Mamma!

109
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,523
They're dirtying the wash!

110
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:16,396
Look what those bastards are doing!

111
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,415
I'll kill you if I catch you!

112
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,046
I'll kill you little bastards!

113
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,216
You'd better run!

114
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,692
Run to the convent
with the white voices!

115
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,559
They'll take care
of cutting off your balls!

116
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,882
Are you running away
or did they already cut off your balls?

117
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,652
They cut balls off here?

118
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:17,717
That's why
they have beautiful voices.

119
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:21,629
- What do balls have to do with it?
- Balls and voices are connected.

120
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,223
They are?

121
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,826
Peppi<i>,</i> Lucarie<i>,</i> are you still there?
Run. Go away.

122
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,565
Run!
The lesson is over!

123
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,165
Filippuccio's were cut off a year ago.

124
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,211
The Prince of San Severo!

125
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:37,406
Jesus! The Prince of San Severo!

126
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:40,974
Don't say his name!
He's a wizard!

127
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:43,646
What are you little bastards doing?

128
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:46,189
No! Don't yell at him!
Yell at me!

129
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:49,784
- He's a great wizard!
- He turns animals into marble!

130
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:53,194
Let go! We're leaving.
We're bored now.

131
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,255
Kiss my hand
and take me back to the palace.

132
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,893
Boy<i>,</i> you're a good for nothing brat.

133
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:03,305
Take me to the palace
or I'll cut off your head.

134
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,070
Cut off my head?
Why? Who are you?

135
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:12,707
If you're a wizard<i>,</i>
why are you asking me?

136
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:24,052
He's really good!
He guessed!

137
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:29,225
Then you must know
that Ferdinando of Spain is dead

138
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,736
and your father<i>,</i> Carlo<i>,</i>
has taken the throne of Spain

139
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,738
and you have become
King of Naples...

140
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,007
Your Majesty.

141
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,981
<i>Being King is a pain in the ass.</i>
<i>You know why?</i>

142
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,750
<i>I had to fart and my feet hurt.</i>
<i>The ceremonies never finish</i>

143
00:14:51,822 --> 00:14:54,188
The ceremony was so moving.

144
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:57,750
All of Naples cried.

145
00:14:57,828 --> 00:14:59,420
They always cry in Naples.

146
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:04,662
They've lost a great King this time.
And you have to be worthy<i>,</i>

147
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:07,260
One king dies<i>,</i> another is crowned.

148
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:12,105
Unfortunately<i>,</i> one king dies
and we risk having a viceroy.

149
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:16,442
Because Austria has ambitions on Naples.
They'll arrange a marriage.

150
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:21,948
My son!

151
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,651
Be worthy of this sword
Louis XIV gave your grandfather<i>,</i> Phillip.

152
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:33,493
You have to use it
to defend our religion only<i>,</i>

153
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:36,624
your person and your subjects.

154
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:42,504
We leave not only a son in Naples<i>,</i>

155
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:46,168
we leave our heart as well.

156
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:47,437
Papa<i>,</i>

157
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,706
if you don't want to be
King of Spain<i>,</i>

158
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,338
who'll make you?

159
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,747
Stay here.
You're the king.

160
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:08,831
- Mamma!
- My son.

161
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:18,373
<i>It's been ten years</i>

162
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:21,969
<i>and being King is a great job.</i>

163
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:24,981
<i>The advisors advise,</i>
<i>councilors council,</i>

164
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,641
<i>commanders command</i>

165
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,241
<i>and I go hunting.</i>

166
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,184
<i>I've discovered women</i>

167
00:16:30,254 --> 00:16:32,347
<i>and the beauty of breasts.</i>

168
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:35,415
<i>At my age, each piece is choice:</i>

169
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:37,188
<i>Country girls, servants</i>

170
00:16:38,095 --> 00:16:39,187
<i>And then,</i>

171
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:43,029
<i>the Princess of Medina arrived</i>

172
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,897
<i>and I discovered love.</i>

173
00:16:44,969 --> 00:16:47,938
<i>I sent her husband, the Prince,</i>
<i>to London as ambassador.</i>

174
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:52,499
<i>Medina is Sicilian</i>
<i>and as fiery as a volcano.</i>

175
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:57,104
<i>She loves to hunt</i>
<i>and she shoots like a demon.</i>

176
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:57,004
<i>Maria Giovanna in Vienna has grown too</i>

177
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:59,474
<i>and can't wait to marry me.</i>

178
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:04,571
<i>Hal She's crying her eyes out</i>
<i>and doesn't want to be Queen of Naples</i>

179
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,843
<i>Her archduchess sisters tease her,</i>

180
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,442
<i>"You're marrying honker nose"</i>

181
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,681
At least pronounce "honker" well!

182
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,814
"You're marrying honker nose!"

183
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,021
Archduchesses mustn't speak that way
of the King of Naples!

184
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,158
Why are you crying<i>,</i> Maria Giovanna?

185
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,566
You'll be Queen!

186
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:30,733
Her Imperial Majesty
is signing the marriage contract.

187
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,771
My darling Franz

188
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:40,112
had the bad taste to die and leave me<i>,</i>
a fat<i>,</i> romantic woman<i>,</i>

189
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:43,915
alone to reign over
the greatest empire in the world.

190
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:48,517
We had children<i>,</i>

191
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:50,924
13 of which are living.

192
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:54,021
I'm happy that you<i>,</i> dear son Joseph<i>,</i>

193
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:56,430
are ruling at my side.

194
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:04,741
We must pay the utmost attention
to the marriage contract.

195
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:08,170
Article Four.

196
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,543
Attention<i>,</i> gentlemen<i>,</i> please.

197
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:17,316
This is the most fundamental point
of the contract

198
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:19,322
between Maria Giovanna
and Ferdinando:

199
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,349
Upon birth of her first son<i>,</i>
the Queen has the right

200
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,520
to participate in the State Council.

201
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:28,497
Will they accept that?

202
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:29,657
Yes.

203
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,896
Carlo of Spain wants this marriage.

204
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,961
They will accept.

205
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,738
- Highness<i>,</i> Maria Giovanna is very ill!
- Very ill?

206
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:54,620
The Austrian Ambassador wants
to speak with His Majesty! Where is he?

207
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:58,822
- At Three Oaks.
- Good! To Three Oaks!

208
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,440
Majesty.

209
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:14,477
Majesty.

210
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:18,447
Majesty<i>,</i> Baron Vittelbach von Muller
has arrived.

211
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:22,149
- Piss on him.
- He came from Vienna!

212
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:27,282
I can't see the Australian ambassador now.
I'm busy!

213
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:31,885
- Poor man<i>,</i> he's chased you all day.
- And he has to wait!

214
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:33,520
Gennar√¨!

215
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:34,586
- Come here.
- Yes?

216
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:38,328
Don't tell these ball busters anything!

217
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:41,894
Understand<i>,</i> Tanucci?
The Austrian Ambassador must wait.

218
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:44,133
No<i>,</i> I'm writing to his father.

219
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,904
He can't do this
to the little Austrian Ambassador!

220
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,946
What if we just return to Naples?

221
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:53,039
What a good idea.

222
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:54,948
I'll take one of these pheasants

223
00:20:55,018 --> 00:20:57,486
and cook it with juniper berries<i>,</i>
like at home.

224
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:01,388
No! You cook pheasant
with oranges and mint!

225
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,119
Where do they do that?

226
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:09,356
- Is everything ready?
- Yes<i>,</i> Majesty.

227
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,924
- How is she dressed?
- Exquisitely!

228
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:15,301
- Who is she dressed up as?
- I can't tell you that.

229
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:18,899
Bastard! You can't keep secrets!
I'm the King!

230
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,605
I'll chop off your head!

231
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,146
Let's go!

232
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:29,675
<i>The Princess of Medina</i>
<i>loves to play games as much as I do.</i>

233
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:34,690
<i>When I had a Chinese-style</i>
<i>hunting lodge built,</i>

234
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:40,492
<i>she surprised me by dressing</i>
<i>as a Chinese</i>

235
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:44,557
<i>and we made love Chinese style</i>

236
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:48,469
<i>Since then, the games begin</i>
<i>when the hunt is over.</i>

237
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,031
<i>The Princess is very inventive</i>

238
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:54,441
<i>Japanese style, Indian style,</i>

239
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:56,206
<i>Spanish style.</i>

240
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,410
<i>She studies lovemaking habits</i>

241
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:03,282
<i>from north, south, east and west.</i>

242
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:05,150
<i>In India they wrap like this,</i>

243
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:09,215
<i>they do it with castanets in Spain</i>...

244
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:13,389
<i>the Princess knows them all.</i>

245
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:15,658
<i>Can I tell you the truth?</i>

246
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:18,826
<i>Masked love is more delicious</i>

247
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:22,565
Gennar√¨<i>,</i> you know my rest is sacred.

248
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:46,523
Are you from the Orient?

249
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:58,434
Who are you?

250
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,646
The Princess
from "A Thousand and One Nights"?

251
00:23:05,782 --> 00:23:09,013
Here's one for the Caliph<i>,</i>

252
00:23:09,086 --> 00:23:12,783
with those eyes!

253
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:18,526
Come here<i>,</i> Sultan's odalisque.

254
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:28,933
Let me drink from the cup
of Allah's garden!

255
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:35,310
Will you belly dance for me?

256
00:23:36,546 --> 00:23:38,207
Turkish style.

257
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:40,614
Without veils?

258
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:42,049
In Arab way.

259
00:23:58,368 --> 00:23:59,960
You're so beautiful!

260
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:08,777
Pardon me<i>,</i> Abbot<i>,</i>

261
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:12,474
you know you can't see the King
when he's resting.

262
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:18,744
- What's with the pagoda?
- And what's with this exotic construction?

263
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:21,450
His Majesty likes China!

264
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:34,770
[Latin]

265
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:41,271
Majesty.

266
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:42,333
Majesty<i>,</i>

267
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:45,778
the Ambassador
has important news for you.

268
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:46,872
Majesty.

269
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:51,215
Your fianc√©<i>,</i> Maria Giovanna<i>,</i>

270
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:52,276
unfortunately...

271
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:53,583
Jesus!

272
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:56,523
- Smallpox!
- Smallpox!

273
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:57,616
Majesty.

274
00:24:57,693 --> 00:25:03,825
Shit on that disease!
Three horns on it!

275
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:10,737
- My God!
- The news has upset his sensitive soul.

276
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:13,400
She wanted to give me the pox!

277
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:15,842
I scratch my balls against you!

278
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:20,939
The horns on my prick
so your curse won't stick!

279
00:25:21,017 --> 00:25:24,748
<i>Meanwhile, Maria Giovanna, still warm,</i>

280
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,288
<i>my father Carlo in Madrid</i>

281
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:29,916
<i>was already arranging a marriage</i>
<i>with another archduchess.</i>

282
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:33,018
The only way
to guarantee peace in Italy...

283
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:37,725
is to marry
one of the Austrian archduchesses.

284
00:25:39,035 --> 00:25:42,436
The Empress has suggested
Maria Giuseppa<i>,</i>

285
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,564
the fifth archduchess<i>,</i>

286
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,835
Three months younger than yourself.

287
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:50,810
When she looks at my portrait

288
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,610
Maria Giuseppa's face falls.

289
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,975
But her sisters aren't teasing now.

290
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:12,859
What are you crying about?

291
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:17,372
I don't want to marry that nose!

292
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,241
- Princesses have no rights<i>,</i> only duty.
- He's ugly!

293
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:27,946
Yes<i>,</i> that's true.

294
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:31,680
But you'll sacrifice yourself
for high politics.

295
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:37,283
You'll do your duty to God
and to your husband

296
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,659
and I'll be satisfied and happy<i>,</i>

297
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,188
even if you're miserable.

298
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:56,043
A poor man like me<i>,</i>
living in exile from my home

299
00:26:56,112 --> 00:27:02,278
and I have to bear
so many pains in the ass!

300
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:05,184
How the hell can we keep this up?

301
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,188
He has our balls in a vice.

302
00:27:07,256 --> 00:27:08,848
Damn them!

303
00:27:08,924 --> 00:27:12,223
Damn their mothers
and fathers and aunties!

304
00:27:12,294 --> 00:27:14,660
- Is he still angry with the bishops?
- I don't know.

305
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,719
- Excellence?
- What?

306
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:17,527
Are you angry with the bishops?

307
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,534
No<i>,</i> it's not that.

308
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:23,038
I'm angry with the peasants
for not getting my oil from Lucca.

309
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:26,404
They have not even brought me
the beans from the Casentino region.

310
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:29,342
They didn't get my good artichokes

311
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:32,073
or even basil for my salad!

312
00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:35,982
- And what can I do?
- What can you do?

313
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:41,683
I feel like I'm dying if I don't have bread
with good oil at night!

314
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:47,993
He sent orders in a letter!

315
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:53,728
Did you read this letter
from my father?

316
00:27:56,272 --> 00:27:59,730
I want to know why I can't marry
the Princess of Medina!

317
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,435
She's married.

318
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,602
So?

319
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:08,139
Why can't her husband
have a little accident in England?

320
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:09,980
No problem<i>,</i> Majesty.

321
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:11,576
Just nod your head

322
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:15,249
and we'll take care of everything<i>,</i>
won't we<i>,</i> Fedele?

323
00:28:15,324 --> 00:28:17,588
We'll ride for Dover today!

324
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,118
Are those the manners I taught you?

325
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,096
We're not brigands! The Princess
isn't even of royal blood!

326
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:28,693
Who cares!

327
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:31,604
She's the woman for me.

328
00:28:31,674 --> 00:28:36,509
She's Sicilian.
Naples-Austria is an alliance.

329
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,604
Naples-Sicily is nothing!

330
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:42,176
Think about your father!

331
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:44,412
He'll throw us all out.

332
00:28:44,486 --> 00:28:50,049
Why does my father<i>,</i>
with the excuse of being king<i>,</i>

333
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:51,990
get to choose my wife?

334
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:55,394
- Who's going to sleep with the archduchess?
You<i>,</i> Tanucci?

335
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:56,988
Me?

336
00:28:57,066 --> 00:28:59,000
No? You<i>,</i> Prince?

337
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:01,093
You<i>,</i> abbot?

338
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,264
No! I'm the poor prick!

339
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,035
Shit!

340
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:10,875
These Hapsburgs<i>,</i>

341
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:13,107
aren't they too sickly?

342
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:17,448
They have smallpox<i>...</i>

343
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,010
Majesty!

344
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:22,846
Speak Italian!

345
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,894
Parisian dresses<i>,</i>

346
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:28,953
Ferdinando's diamond medallion<i>,</i>

347
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:32,000
34 royal coaches with horses<i>,</i>

348
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,434
nine carriages<i>,</i>

349
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:40,237
four baggage wagons

350
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,936
and the fittings.

351
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:45,378
My darling Franz<i>,</i> my husband<i>,</i>

352
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:47,244
your father...

353
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:49,876
Your father

354
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:54,514
lived for 56 years<i>,</i>
8 months and 10 days.

355
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,718
He died on August 17th<i>,</i>

356
00:29:57,793 --> 00:29:59,954
at 9:30 at night.

357
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:02,054
He lived for 680 months<i>,</i>

358
00:30:02,131 --> 00:30:05,931
2<i>,</i>958 weeks<i>,</i>

359
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:08,731
20<i>,</i>780 days<i>,</i>

360
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:14,572
496<i>,</i>492 hours.

361
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:19,945
My happy marriage lasted
29 years<i>,</i> 6 months and 6 days.

362
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:22,506
That makes 355 months<i>,</i>

363
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:25,485
1 <i>,</i>540 weeks.

364
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:28,819
10<i>,</i>780 days.

365
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:33,351
758<i>,</i>744 hours.

366
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:37,365
We'll honor his memory
in the Capuchin Crypt.

367
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:39,824
No<i>,</i> mother!

368
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:42,632
You will honor your father
at the crypt!

369
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:45,367
You will honor your father<i>,</i>

370
00:30:45,441 --> 00:30:47,739
your Aunt Isabella<i>,</i>

371
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,904
and your sister<i>,</i> Maria Giovanna!

372
00:30:57,219 --> 00:30:58,743
Speak Italian!

373
00:30:58,821 --> 00:31:00,914
They died of pox!

374
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:04,758
<i>That disgusting Capuchin Crypt</i>

375
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:06,260
<i>is the Hapsburg's sacred tomb.</i>

376
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:08,660
<i>The girl is right</i>...

377
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:10,892
<i>it's full of fresh bodies with the pox</i>

378
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:14,231
<i>But Maria Theresa dragged her</i>

379
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:19,502
<i>to those crawling, wormy, dead bodies</i>
<i>in the crypt.</i>

380
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:44,129
He's looking at Vesuvius.

381
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:58,141
You must be patient.

382
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:04,448
His Majesty becomes profound
when contemplating nature.

383
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,355
Don't dare bother him!
He enjoys his sadness...

384
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:12,326
Shut up!

385
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:15,596
- Majesty?
- What?

386
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:20,067
- This is Professor Cantalamessa.
- That's one hell of a prick!

387
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:21,932
To your health!

388
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:27,838
He is the secretary to Lord Hamilton...

389
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,571
the ambassador to England<i>,</i>

390
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:32,511
and a master of our antiquities.

391
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:36,110
This Priapus weighing a huge phallus

392
00:32:36,185 --> 00:32:39,746
was painted to ward off the evil eye

393
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:42,791
and bring luck to the house.

394
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,458
It's no wonder why
the Roman Empire lasted!

395
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,294
They had enough pricks and balls
to ward off anything!

396
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:53,493
It's an eel!

397
00:32:54,503 --> 00:32:57,301
- Stop it!
- What did I do?

398
00:32:57,372 --> 00:33:00,500
Filth comes from your mouth
the minute you open it!

399
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:02,510
It was His Majesty's fault.

400
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:05,012
But he's King and you're not!

401
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,243
I see two gentlemen arriving.

402
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:10,046
Who are they?

403
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:13,521
Our Abbot Galiani

404
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:16,990
and the Austrian Ambassador.

405
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:18,924
Again?

406
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:24,265
Pardon<i>,</i> Majesty.
I bring...

407
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:27,461
Bad news. I knew it!

408
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,137
Fate is against

409
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:34,369
the Empress' daughters.

410
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:38,379
As befell Archduchess Maria Giovanna...

411
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:40,712
Maria Giuseppa too?

412
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,143
Dead?

413
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:46,483
Smallpox?

414
00:33:46,555 --> 00:33:52,960
I told you!
Get me garlic!

415
00:33:53,028 --> 00:33:55,019
Rub that evil eye prick!

416
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:56,997
Vienna is cursed!
Rub your balls!

417
00:33:57,065 --> 00:33:59,260
All of you<i>,</i> rub your balls!

418
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:03,998
- I don't do that even for my wife!
- This is enough for a war.

419
00:34:04,806 --> 00:34:07,331
Vienna brings bad luck!

420
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:10,674
Yes<i>,</i> do blame the messenger!
When he brings bad luck.

421
00:34:10,746 --> 00:34:14,045
In every way<i>,</i>
the Hapsburgs are bad luck!

422
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:18,286
Vesuvius is erupting!

423
00:34:18,353 --> 00:34:20,753
Earthquake!

424
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:33,960
<i>An earthquake and two rotting deaths</i>
<i>are true signs, aren't they?</i>

425
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:39,668
<i>I have to stay away from the Hapsburgs,</i>
<i>alive, dead or rotting</i>

426
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:42,938
<i>But while my father</i>
<i>had his portrait painted,</i>

427
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:46,640
<i>he had nothing better to do</i>
<i>than make trouble for me.</i>

428
00:34:46,715 --> 00:34:51,345
Now<i>,</i> the question is to choose between
Maria Amalia and Maria Carolina.

429
00:34:52,487 --> 00:34:54,853
This one is five years older...

430
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:58,521
and the other
is 19 months younger than Ferdinando.

431
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:02,223
Archduchess Maria Carolina
seems more docile.

432
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:03,855
Also because she's younger.

433
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:08,997
Let's hope she's healthier
than her sisters!

434
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:18,042
<i>Now, if a regular young rascal</i>
<i>guts a boar,</i>

435
00:35:18,113 --> 00:35:20,172
<i>he's a great hunter.</i>

436
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:23,547
<i>If I do, I go down in history</i>

437
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,644
<i>as a bloodthirsty son of a bitch</i>

438
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:31,954
Majesty<i>,</i> have the courtesy
and good manners to listen to me!

439
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:36,430
You must see the Austrian Ambassador.

440
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:41,663
It's protocol! If you refuse to see him<i>,</i>
it's like a declaration of war!

441
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:44,069
Do you want a war?

442
00:35:45,307 --> 00:35:47,207
And now you also hit me with your hat!

443
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,537
Majesty!

444
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,703
But please<i>,</i> Your Majesty<i>,</i>
do me the favor to give me an answer.

445
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:52,770
Why don't you want to receive
the ambassador?

446
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:56,079
I want to know why<i>,</i> Majesty<i>,</i>
you won't speak to the ambassador!

447
00:35:56,151 --> 00:35:57,743
- Where is he from?
- Vienna.

448
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:01,118
- Get rid of him!
- Your father agreed!

449
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:04,647
There are three left
and you have to marry one of them!

450
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:05,715
Majesty<i>,</i>

451
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:08,888
you can't compromise peace in Europe

452
00:36:08,964 --> 00:36:11,057
over silly superstitions.

453
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:14,296
- Two dead from smallpox is superstition?
- You didn't die<i>,</i> they did!

454
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,829
I wouldn't marry one of those witches
if I were dead!

455
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:20,898
Not even dead!

456
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:23,968
Get out or I'll call the guards!

457
00:36:24,046 --> 00:36:25,673
Okay<i>,</i> okay.

458
00:36:25,747 --> 00:36:28,648
We'd better leave.
Let's go.

459
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:35,416
How can he reign with horns and spells!
This makes chickens laugh!

460
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,860
- Can't I go to the stables instead?
- The advisors want your signature.

461
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:44,262
They're woodcock hunting today.

462
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:47,995
- What am I signing?
- Your correspondence.

463
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,038
This is for your father...

464
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:55,543
and this is for
the Viennese Court.

465
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,736
Is everything ready?

466
00:36:56,812 --> 00:37:00,043
Please read what you sign!

467
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,412
That would be prudent.

468
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:04,418
You could be signing your abdication.

469
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:06,647
He's right<i>,</i> Majesty.

470
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:09,987
Stop busting my balls!

471
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:11,491
I'm busy today!

472
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,963
I have a date with a beautiful...

473
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,460
wild boar!

474
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:26,340
Those pass through<i>,</i>
and once they've passed through...

475
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:27,705
Goodbye<i>,</i> advisors!

476
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:31,007
- Majesty<i>,</i> are we after woodcocks?
- Woodcocks<i>,</i> woodcocks.

477
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:34,176
Did he sign it?

478
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:37,218
Has he signed?
Yes<i>,</i> he signed. Certainly<i>,</i> he's signed.

479
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:42,790
He's officially asked for
the Archduchess Carolina's hand<i>,</i>

480
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:45,486
and this time he'll marry her.

481
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,152
We fucked him!

482
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:50,255
I sent for the Austrian courier.

483
00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:53,199
He's flying to Vienna!

484
00:37:56,204 --> 00:37:59,696
By the way<i>,</i>
who is going to tell His Majesty?

485
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:04,036
Me?

486
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:09,913
Don't count on it!

487
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,542
Abbot...

488
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:15,715
I won't think about it!

489
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:19,256
Abbot...

490
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:21,887
Stop that!

491
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:23,555
Abbot<i>...</i>

492
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,595
No. Absolutely not.

493
00:38:35,943 --> 00:38:37,205
Where is he?

494
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:38,834
Majesty.

495
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:44,611
How should I know
where he's eating on the grass?

496
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:51,148
God help me.

497
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:56,624
Look<i>,</i> it's our Galiani!

498
00:38:59,033 --> 00:39:01,228
All of my congratulations!

499
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:03,327
Congratulations<i>,</i> Majesty!

500
00:39:03,404 --> 00:39:07,067
- What for?
- For the good of the kingdom<i>,</i>

501
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:11,305
you've promised to marry
Maria Carolina of Austria!

502
00:39:14,248 --> 00:39:16,045
What are you talking about?

503
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:22,614
You signed the marriage agreement!

504
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,557
Who played this trick?

505
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:28,459
- Who dared?
- Shut up!

506
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:31,555
- Your father<i>,</i> King of Spain.
- Who signed it?

507
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:34,123
- You did<i>,</i> Majesty.
- You didn't tell me!

508
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:38,969
I've told you a million times
to read what you sign.

509
00:39:39,874 --> 00:39:43,708
What the hell kind of advisors are you?

510
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:47,009
I don't want any part
of that scabby family.

511
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:50,516
I'm not marrying her.

512
00:39:50,585 --> 00:39:54,487
I can't offend Maria Theresa
or we'll have a war<i>,</i>

513
00:39:54,555 --> 00:39:56,785
so...

514
00:39:57,692 --> 00:39:59,455
So... what?

515
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:03,687
I want you to get rid of her.

516
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,289
Me!

517
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:10,367
- I can do it!
- Shut up!

518
00:40:10,438 --> 00:40:13,134
Aren't you a wizard?

519
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:16,370
Didn't you turn a cat into marble?

520
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:18,969
You have marbled the cat<i>,</i> haven't you?

521
00:40:19,046 --> 00:40:23,039
- Turn Carolina into marble!
- I should turn her to marble?

522
00:40:23,117 --> 00:40:24,607
Make her die.

523
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:28,280
Cast a really gruesome spell

524
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:31,450
so I can get out of the agreement.

525
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:35,519
- San Severo<i>,</i> that's an order.
- If I don't<i>,</i> you'll chop off my head?

526
00:40:41,903 --> 00:40:44,997
He's a genius.

527
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:48,508
I have to marbleize Carolina
or he'll chop off my head.

528
00:40:48,576 --> 00:40:51,636
Don't lose your head.

529
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:56,046
The letter he's about to get
from his father will marbleize him!

530
00:40:56,117 --> 00:40:58,051
I'm not worried.

531
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,146
Peel me a prickly pear<i>,</i> boy.

532
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:07,383
Sweetest<i>,</i> Highest Sovereign Majesty<i>,</i>

533
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:11,022
this is a royal agreement.

534
00:41:11,098 --> 00:41:13,862
You must!

535
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:16,927
The official letter
is coming from Vienna.

536
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:21,100
You can't play
with the Empress this way!

537
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:22,437
Be brave<i>,</i> love.

538
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,172
There's an old Sicilian song that says:

539
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:28,613
"Destiny is a cloud<i>,</i>
we know not where it floats."

540
00:41:28,683 --> 00:41:32,414
Fuck Sicilian songs!

541
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:34,249
I'll take care of my destiny.

542
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:38,655
I don't want to marry her!

543
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:41,854
I don't want to!
I don't want to!

544
00:41:44,365 --> 00:41:47,027
I don't want to!

545
00:41:47,101 --> 00:41:49,331
Stop that now.

546
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:53,771
The Empress wishes to see you.

547
00:41:57,011 --> 00:41:58,774
Come quickly<i>,</i> please.

548
00:41:58,846 --> 00:42:01,110
Caroline<i>,</i> please.

549
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:06,952
Mama is wicked!

550
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:12,482
She'll ruin us
with her political ambitions.

551
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,927
She doesn't love us.
I don't want to!

552
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:23,361
I don't want to marry the ugly nose!

553
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:26,235
He's bad luck<i>,</i> cursed!

554
00:42:26,307 --> 00:42:27,672
He's bad luck!

555
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:31,610
He made my sisters die of pox.

556
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:35,080
Here comes Her Imperial Highness.

557
00:42:43,658 --> 00:42:46,058
Leave us alone.

558
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,063
You will marry!

559
00:42:56,337 --> 00:42:58,066
Maria Carolina<i>,</i>

560
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:02,473
you are the one most like me.

561
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:05,774
Don't disappoint me.

562
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:09,782
The wedding gown
has already been altered.

563
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:12,275
It was Maria Giuseppa's!

564
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:19,151
It has pearls and precious stones

565
00:43:19,226 --> 00:43:23,959
and Ferdinando's portrait
surrounded by diamonds.

566
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:26,328
Maria Carolina<i>,</i>

567
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,992
you'll be very beautiful!

568
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:31,232
It was Maria Giuseppa's.

569
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:09,502
She's ill!

570
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:11,568
She's fainted!

571
00:44:11,645 --> 00:44:14,170
Joseph<i>,</i> if Carolina dies of smallpox<i>,</i>

572
00:44:14,248 --> 00:44:17,240
no one will mix blood with ours.

573
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:19,946
Call Doctor Gherber!

574
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:23,487
Stop crying<i>,</i> Marie Antoinette!

575
00:44:23,557 --> 00:44:27,220
Mama<i>,</i> If she dies

576
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:30,092
I don't want to marry
the King of France!

577
00:44:43,878 --> 00:44:47,314
It's not confirmed<i>,</i> Majesty!

578
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:50,316
She's rotten with smallpox!

579
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:52,045
It's not smallpox!

580
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:53,984
They said she was slightly ill.

581
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:57,957
The Ambassador mentioned
a minor uneasiness.

582
00:44:58,025 --> 00:45:01,984
We'll have a stroke chasing you!

583
00:45:02,063 --> 00:45:05,999
I'll write her a letter!

584
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,694
I'm King Ferdinando

585
00:45:07,768 --> 00:45:08,860
and I don't want to marry!

586
00:45:08,936 --> 00:45:15,102
And I do not want to get married.
For God's sake<i>,</i> stop it. Don't act like a fool!

587
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:17,940
He's like a drunken Satan!

588
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:20,276
Saint Gennaro!

589
00:45:20,347 --> 00:45:26,752
Saint Genna<i>,</i> look at me!
I don't give a fuck about war with Austria!

590
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:29,483
I don't want that scab in my house!

591
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:31,616
I won't marry her!

592
00:45:35,096 --> 00:45:37,997
He'll marry her.

593
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:41,193
Damn<i>,</i> I'm in a madhouse.

594
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:49,733
<i>San Severo is a wizard.</i>
<i>He said, "He'll marry her."</i>

595
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,711
<i>A few hours later, in fact</i>

596
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,114
<i>I was comfy with my little princess, when...</i>

597
00:45:57,184 --> 00:46:00,244
<i>We were making love, when...</i>

598
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,482
Majesty.

599
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:09,658
How dare you!

600
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,698
Excuse me for disturbing you<i>,</i>

601
00:46:11,765 --> 00:46:14,427
but Abbot Galiani urgently wants
to speak to you.

602
00:46:14,502 --> 00:46:16,902
- Should I let him in?
- No!

603
00:46:16,971 --> 00:46:19,405
He says it's urgent.

604
00:46:19,473 --> 00:46:21,031
Majesty.

605
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:24,370
Majesty... Oh<i>,</i> excuse me.

606
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:27,039
- News from Vienna!
- You dirty old man!

607
00:46:27,114 --> 00:46:29,173
It was just a cold.

608
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,344
The archduchess is fine.

609
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:34,512
The royal cortege has departed.

610
00:46:35,956 --> 00:46:37,651
That means...

611
00:46:39,994 --> 00:46:42,326
goodbye<i>,</i> my love.

612
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:44,728
I'm fucked.

613
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:48,190
I'm fucked!

614
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:50,999
I'm fucked!

615
00:46:51,405 --> 00:46:54,374
<i>I'm fucked.</i>

616
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:58,241
Fucked.

617
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:02,880
Courage<i>,</i> Majesty<i>,</i> courage.

618
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:07,512
Those nuns... they made us call a priest.

619
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:10,580
I don't want to die!

620
00:47:10,658 --> 00:47:13,286
<i>Ghosts return.</i>

621
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,729
<i>Ghosts are shitty, they betray you.</i>

622
00:47:17,798 --> 00:47:22,701
<i>They trick a poor king who's dying.</i>

623
00:47:22,836 --> 00:47:24,861
<i>I search for my beautiful memories</i>

624
00:47:24,939 --> 00:47:27,601
<i>but the dark ones return.</i>

625
00:47:30,844 --> 00:47:33,506
Pity him!

626
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:37,344
Oh<i>,</i> my God!

627
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:49,286
<i>Long live the King</i>

628
00:47:49,363 --> 00:47:51,354
<i>It's the Bloody Brigand</i>

629
00:47:51,432 --> 00:47:54,060
<i>He drinks blood from chopped heads</i>

630
00:47:54,134 --> 00:47:57,831
<i>He yells, "Long live the King"</i>

631
00:47:59,673 --> 00:48:01,140
- God!
- Blessed Mother!

632
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,675
- He's dying.
- Father!

633
00:48:02,743 --> 00:48:04,677
He's dying.
Get the 7 Thieves Vinegar!

634
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:08,010
- Doctor<i>,</i> thieves vinegar!
- Salt...

635
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:11,142
Sister<i>,</i> you pray!
I'll get the vinegar.

636
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:14,187
What manners! Please<i>,</i> a little respect.

637
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:24,019
<i>Caracciolo, eaten by fish</i>

638
00:48:24,098 --> 00:48:26,123
<i>Hung by my order</i>

639
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,258
<i>San Felice's throat</i>

640
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:31,065
<i>cut by my order</i>

641
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,506
<i>What do these corpses</i>
<i>want from me?</i>

642
00:48:37,578 --> 00:48:41,708
Why are the dead looking for me?

643
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,181
Saint Gennaro<i>,</i> help me!
Jesus<i>,</i> Mary and Joseph<i>,</i> help!

644
00:48:50,257 --> 00:48:52,623
Saint Rita<i>,</i> Saint Lucy!

645
00:48:52,693 --> 00:48:54,684
Saint Cosma and Damiano!

646
00:48:54,762 --> 00:48:56,821
Saints<i>,</i> help me!

647
00:48:57,097 --> 00:49:00,066
What do these corpses want from me?

648
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:06,573
What do these corpses
want from me?

649
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,837
- Put him in bed!
- Dead men!

650
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,841
Slit throats!

651
00:49:19,153 --> 00:49:20,620
Majesty...

652
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,817
Majesty<i>,</i> open your soul to me.

653
00:49:26,894 --> 00:49:30,489
- Confess your sins.
- No!

654
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:35,664
I don't have anything to confess.

655
00:49:38,772 --> 00:49:42,503
I've always been pure as bread!

656
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:45,670
As pure as bread!

657
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:51,917
You must admit you've had
a history of harsh repression.

658
00:49:51,985 --> 00:49:57,389
And your ghosts
are coming to tug at you<i>,</i>

659
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:58,584
isn't that true?

660
00:50:01,562 --> 00:50:04,554
I was always a good boy.

661
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:09,567
The people loved me.

662
00:50:10,604 --> 00:50:16,440
I was good<i>,</i> generous.

663
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:18,569
They called me their father.

664
00:50:18,645 --> 00:50:20,078
Well<i>,</i> Majesty...

665
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,513
What "well"?

666
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,777
I did a lot of good.
I was close to the people.

667
00:50:26,854 --> 00:50:28,116
Well<i>,</i> Majesty<i>,</i>

668
00:50:28,188 --> 00:50:30,952
maybe you don't recall<i>,</i>

669
00:50:31,024 --> 00:50:35,085
but you beheaded a lot of people.

670
00:50:35,162 --> 00:50:37,426
What?

671
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:39,762
It was four little heads.

672
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:42,461
Four<i>,</i> little heads.

673
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:48,902
And I'm the King!

674
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:55,677
They... traitors<i>,</i> Jacobins<i>,</i> Republicans.

675
00:50:55,749 --> 00:50:57,444
They cut heads<i>,</i> slit<i>,</i>
used guillotine with poor people.

676
00:50:57,518 --> 00:50:59,748
They chopped heads<i>,</i>

677
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,721
slit throats<i>,</i> guillotined<i>,</i>

678
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,417
hung!

679
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:09,126
They murdered the people

680
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:12,597
with war<i>,</i> revolutions<i>,</i> Napoleons<i>,</i>

681
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:15,134
terror and blood of their dead!

682
00:51:16,937 --> 00:51:18,302
And now<i>,</i>

683
00:51:19,706 --> 00:51:23,642
they want to make me pay?

684
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:27,043
As if I were the only one.

685
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:32,283
Anyway<i>,</i>

686
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:37,312
it was that Austrian...

687
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:39,124
Carolina.

688
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:41,320
I didn't want to marry her!

689
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:55,533
What a face.

690
00:52:55,903 --> 00:53:00,306
She's a young girl<i>,</i> almost a child.

691
00:53:00,374 --> 00:53:03,969
This little one isn't bad<i>,</i> eh?

692
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:06,376
Little girl<i>,</i> little baby...

693
00:53:06,446 --> 00:53:12,112
Those eyes look more concerned
with power than baby dolls.

694
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:17,991
To command is better than to fuck... maybe.

695
00:53:57,298 --> 00:53:59,061
I beg your pardon<i>,</i> Your Majesty.

696
00:54:14,715 --> 00:54:17,309
Pardon me<i>,</i> gentlemen.

697
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,017
Majesty<i>,</i>
may I speak with you privately?

698
00:54:25,092 --> 00:54:28,721
Yes.
Everyone<i>,</i> please leave.

699
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:33,256
Gentlemen<i>,</i> the King wants to be alone.

700
00:54:33,334 --> 00:54:37,168
Please step outside.

701
00:54:40,207 --> 00:54:44,769
- Me too?
- Leave and close the door!

702
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:47,143
Come.

703
00:54:50,784 --> 00:54:53,150
I can't do this.

704
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:56,121
I'm scared.

705
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,925
I can't make it.
I am scared.

706
00:55:02,997 --> 00:55:04,396
I want only you.

707
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:09,896
Cheer up<i>,</i> love.
Look at this!

708
00:55:12,306 --> 00:55:15,275
Come on<i>,</i> Nanduzzo. Look.
These. They are astonishing.

709
00:55:15,342 --> 00:55:19,403
- Saint Gennaro blessed these!
- Yes!

710
00:55:21,482 --> 00:55:25,509
But you must promise to be good.

711
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:29,955
- That you'll be a Borbone.
- A Borbone.

712
00:55:30,024 --> 00:55:31,924
- She's pretty.
- Yes.

713
00:55:31,992 --> 00:55:34,392
And you'll be fine.

714
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:38,421
But if you ever need me<i>,</i>

715
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:40,364
I'll always be there.

716
00:55:40,434 --> 00:55:41,958
Always?

717
00:55:42,803 --> 00:55:44,031
Always!

718
00:57:22,469 --> 00:57:26,599
- Does Your Majesty feel at home?
- Yes<i>,</i> thank you.

719
00:57:26,674 --> 00:57:29,609
Your Majesty certainly needs no advice...

720
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:32,271
- Surely not.
- Just in case it's necessary<i>,</i>

721
00:57:32,346 --> 00:57:34,780
our experience is at your command.

722
00:57:34,848 --> 00:57:37,214
Her Majesty knows what to do.

723
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:39,582
...in any situation.

724
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:45,086
Are you speaking of joining... carnally?

725
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:48,788
- We would never dare.
- For Heaven's sake<i>,</i> Her Majesty.

726
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:50,853
But your wedding night...

727
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:55,360
Sleepers catch no fish!

728
00:57:58,472 --> 00:58:02,067
Our mother<i>,</i> Empress Maria Theresa<i>,</i>

729
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:06,806
explained our conjugal duties.

730
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,213
One<i>,</i> don't be coy.

731
00:58:10,284 --> 00:58:15,187
Two<i>,</i> obey and respect
the Royal consort.

732
00:58:16,123 --> 00:58:18,853
Three<i>,</i> remain at his side.

733
00:58:18,926 --> 00:58:20,086
And<i>,</i> four<i>,</i>

734
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,062
avoid all comparisons
of the North

735
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:26,031
with the South!

736
00:58:29,336 --> 00:58:34,000
- Gennarie<i>,</i> where are you?
- Here I am. Let me in<i>,</i> please.

737
00:58:34,074 --> 00:58:35,701
I went for your perfume.

738
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:39,439
The groom must be handsome!

739
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:41,572
Your Majesty<i>,</i> what can you do?

740
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:45,140
And so says Pulcinella<i>,</i>
"No more playing with tits!"

741
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:51,822
His Majesty is finally getting a donut
with a Hapsburg middle in it!

742
00:58:51,892 --> 00:58:57,296
His Excellency
has become more humorous for joy!

743
00:58:57,364 --> 00:58:59,730
Humorous and naughty!

744
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,201
Long live the political winds

745
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:06,899
that lift the sheets of a lover's bed!

746
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:10,036
Speaking of which<i>,</i>

747
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:14,410
did Papa send any advice
on how I must behave tonight?

748
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:18,647
He knows you don't need any.

749
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:21,381
Blessings this night.

750
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:23,616
Blessings? I want a good night!

751
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,526
Let's hope he really doesn't
start a war with Austria tonight!

752
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:35,829
Here we are.

753
00:59:35,903 --> 00:59:38,804
Here's your hot water<i>,</i> Majesty.

754
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:42,699
Idiot!

755
01:02:25,238 --> 01:02:29,038
Majesty<i>,</i> you have some pretty tits.

756
01:02:29,643 --> 01:02:30,632
Pardon?

757
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:34,036
Your tits are tiny...

758
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:38,813
but appetizing.

759
01:02:40,187 --> 01:02:42,018
No understand.

760
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:46,122
You don't understand tits?

761
01:02:46,193 --> 01:02:49,162
Those are tits.

762
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:52,323
You're Queen of Naples<i>,</i>
you have to understand Italian!

763
01:02:52,399 --> 01:02:55,630
I speak Italian!
This is not Italian.

764
01:02:55,702 --> 01:02:58,034
It's Neapolitan!

765
01:02:58,105 --> 01:03:02,474
Neapolitan: The only Italian
for the Queen of Naples.

766
01:03:04,878 --> 01:03:08,439
Aren't you hot<i>,</i> Majesty?

767
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:34,929
What?

768
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,879
What are you looking at?

769
01:04:21,555 --> 01:04:23,716
You thought I had the evil eye...

770
01:04:26,026 --> 01:04:28,893
and I thought you did!

771
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:35,260
And now we got rid of the evil eye!

772
01:04:35,335 --> 01:04:40,398
Do you know what we're going to do?

773
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:42,772
Did your mommy explain it?

774
01:04:44,277 --> 01:04:47,337
I don't understand your language!

775
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:52,241
I'll teach you!

776
01:04:53,687 --> 01:04:58,624
Stay still!
You're wearing knickers!

777
01:04:58,692 --> 01:05:00,523
Stay still.

778
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:04,257
Didn't your mommy tell you
there'd be no knickers tonight?

779
01:05:05,932 --> 01:05:10,733
I want them off!
I'm going to rip them off!

780
01:05:13,306 --> 01:05:15,536
Turn over!
The bitch wants to ruin me!

781
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:18,271
So<i>,</i> I'll tear everything up.

782
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:23,545
And you place your feet on my face.

783
01:05:33,426 --> 01:05:35,986
You're crazy!

784
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:37,620
Turn over...

785
01:05:41,701 --> 01:05:43,328
How dare you!

786
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:47,171
I've never been slapped!

787
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,538
I'm the king!
The king!

788
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:54,137
I'm your husband
and I'll show you who commands!

789
01:05:54,214 --> 01:05:55,841
Never try that again!

790
01:05:55,916 --> 01:06:00,319
Never try that again
or I'll make your ass black and blue!

791
01:06:00,387 --> 01:06:04,585
Then I'll chop off your head and send it

792
01:06:04,658 --> 01:06:07,388
to your fatso mother in Austria!

793
01:06:18,038 --> 01:06:20,905
So<i>,</i> she likes to bite.

794
01:06:20,974 --> 01:06:23,841
She's a lioness?
But I'm a lion.

795
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:30,375
I'm going to fuck you.

796
01:06:52,806 --> 01:06:56,298
<i>From that moment on</i>

797
01:06:56,376 --> 01:06:59,868
<i>I never thought of the evil eye again.</i>

798
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:25,194
What does this "fuck" mean?

799
01:07:27,908 --> 01:07:31,173
What we've been doing till now<i>,</i>
my pretty one.

800
01:07:34,748 --> 01:07:39,708
Jesus<i>,</i> what a sweet <i>panaro</i> you have!

801
01:07:39,786 --> 01:07:42,277
"Panaro." What is panaro?

802
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,587
Ass!

803
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:49,626
Ugly<i>,</i> honker-nose pig!

804
01:07:51,765 --> 01:07:57,294
If I'm a pig<i>,</i> you're my piglet.

805
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:01,101
I really like you<i>,</i> Caroli!

806
01:08:03,743 --> 01:08:07,270
Ferdina!

807
01:08:07,347 --> 01:08:11,943
<i>To tell the truth,</i>
<i>I can't complain about Carolina in bed.</i>

808
01:08:12,819 --> 01:08:17,483
<i>When her brother, Emperor Joseph,</i>
<i>came to see how things were in Naples,</i>

809
01:08:17,557 --> 01:08:19,525
<i>he noticed too.</i>

810
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:30,562
I never imagined the Austrian Emperor
to be so handsome!

811
01:08:34,974 --> 01:08:36,305
Princess<i>,</i>

812
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,138
Princess<i>,</i> how do you look at him?

813
01:08:40,045 --> 01:08:44,106
You've already had a King<i>,</i>
are you looking at an Emperor?

814
01:08:44,183 --> 01:08:48,017
Would you like to place a wager?

815
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:54,489
One<i>,</i> two<i>,</i> three<i>,</i> ladies.

816
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,723
One<i>,</i> two<i>,</i> three<i>,</i> knights.

817
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:08,330
Majesty<i>,</i> please remember

818
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:10,705
the Emperor is a very cultured man.

819
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:13,336
He may also be a Mason.

820
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,777
- Why is he here?
- Empress' orders!

821
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:29,385
"You go to Naples and discover
why Carolina has no babies!"

822
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:33,329
Does mama want him
to get into our bed?

823
01:09:39,772 --> 01:09:44,266
Look at my bear<i>,</i> he's a fool.

824
01:09:44,343 --> 01:09:46,834
He's ugly<i>,</i> but he's sweet.

825
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,077
The problem is that he thinks
he's handsome and smart.

826
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,311
But<i>,</i> my dear Joseph<i>,</i>

827
01:09:53,385 --> 01:09:57,287
my husband doesn't give
the slightest fuck about governing.

828
01:09:57,356 --> 01:10:00,086
What language<i>,</i> Carolina!

829
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:04,459
How you speak.
Like a vulgar Neapolitan.

830
01:10:05,464 --> 01:10:08,433
Never forget that culture is the weapon

831
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:12,334
to re-conquer Naples for Austria.

832
01:10:12,404 --> 01:10:15,202
Poor Ferdinando<i>,</i> don't intimidate him.

833
01:10:15,274 --> 01:10:16,605
He's a big baby!

834
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:30,181
<i>Emperor Joseph isn't used to our games.</i>

835
01:10:30,255 --> 01:10:34,055
<i>But that's the fun of being King</i>

836
01:10:34,126 --> 01:10:37,960
<i>They go to that Capuchin Crypt in Vienna,</i>

837
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,965
<i>so how can they get a laugh?</i>

838
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:43,126
<i>I'll show the Emperor how to have fun</i>

839
01:11:40,225 --> 01:11:47,028
- What's it called? Blind man's "fluff"?
- No<i>,</i> bluff! They have fun this way!

840
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:25,967
- His Majesty is amused!
- Let God take care of him!

841
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:35,176
Hey<i>,</i> Joe! Feel how sweaty I am!

842
01:12:36,715 --> 01:12:38,910
Give me a piggy back ride!

843
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:45,819
Leave my brother alone<i>,</i> honker-nose!

844
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:49,755
What's happening?

845
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:53,264
- Carola... She's ill!
- Call a doctor!

846
01:12:57,202 --> 01:13:00,262
- It's nothing<i>,</i> I was dizzy.
- It was nothing.

847
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:02,766
She was only dizzy!

848
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:06,902
Yesterday she was flushed<i>,</i>
there's no doubt now.

849
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:10,813
I want to bring mama good news.

850
01:13:10,883 --> 01:13:13,249
Reassure her<i>,</i>

851
01:13:13,318 --> 01:13:17,311
I know that if it's a son
Carolina will sit on the State Council.

852
01:13:17,389 --> 01:13:21,416
I can't forget.
What a head full your sister gave me!

853
01:13:26,164 --> 01:13:30,032
- It's over now.
- Up we go!

854
01:13:32,104 --> 01:13:33,469
You're getting fat<i>,</i> Majesty!

855
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:37,099
Excuse me<i>,</i> ladies and knights.

856
01:13:42,547 --> 01:13:47,678
<i>They want a boy in Vienna,</i>
<i>but the first two were girls.</i>

857
01:13:47,753 --> 01:13:51,245
<i>They laugh and tease us,</i>

858
01:13:51,323 --> 01:13:53,120
<i>"When will there be a baby boy?"</i>

859
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:56,388
<i>I don't give a fuck.</i>
<i>I make love to Carolina</i>

860
01:13:56,461 --> 01:13:58,656
<i>and as for the rest,</i>
<i>let God take care of it</i>

861
01:14:03,035 --> 01:14:08,439
<i>My sweet mother in Madrid died</i>

862
01:14:08,507 --> 01:14:11,499
<i>and my father vowed eternal chastity.</i>

863
01:14:11,576 --> 01:14:15,979
<i>Yes, he's religious, chaste, pious.</i>

864
01:14:16,048 --> 01:14:19,040
<i>But eternal chastity?</i>
<i>He's insane</i>

865
01:14:39,104 --> 01:14:44,701
It's hard<i>,</i> but I vowed chastity
to my wife on her deathbed.

866
01:14:48,146 --> 01:14:50,410
I will be chaste!

867
01:14:54,186 --> 01:14:57,952
Now<i>,</i> Maria Carolina and Naples<i>,</i>

868
01:14:58,023 --> 01:15:02,756
I wanted that marriage to assure peace

869
01:15:02,828 --> 01:15:06,696
and now I fear the worst!

870
01:15:06,765 --> 01:15:11,930
Austria doesn't want peace<i>,</i>
she wants to rule Naples again!

871
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:15,167
Carolina is ambitious!

872
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,730
She's had two daughters<i>,</i>

873
01:15:16,808 --> 01:15:21,438
but unfortunately<i>,</i>
a son will change things for her.

874
01:15:22,581 --> 01:15:24,276
Do you know

875
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:27,711
she's filled Naples
with Masonic Lodges?

876
01:15:27,786 --> 01:15:31,779
I do not like this!
I do not like this!

877
01:15:34,893 --> 01:15:38,294
That Austrian dominates my son.

878
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:42,322
I'm told she's teaching him...

879
01:15:47,072 --> 01:15:51,736
The knights<i>,</i> ladies<i>,</i> war<i>,</i>
weapons<i>,</i> gloves<i>,</i> right?

880
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:56,577
No<i>,</i> not gloves! Loves!

881
01:15:58,216 --> 01:16:00,616
All right<i>,</i> "loves."

882
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:03,984
You must memorize poetry!

883
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:07,423
Let's study nice for once.

884
01:16:09,428 --> 01:16:10,986
My leg!

885
01:16:11,063 --> 01:16:13,463
I'm tired!

886
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:16,092
Always this fuck<i>,</i> fuck!

887
01:16:16,168 --> 01:16:19,296
One huge belly after another!

888
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:24,570
You must learn to use your head

889
01:16:24,643 --> 01:16:26,975
as well as that big dopey fish!

890
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,947
But you like my dogfish.

891
01:16:41,593 --> 01:16:46,530
Learn that poetry<i>,</i>
ignorant brute!

892
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:05,873
You learned<i>,</i> "Go fuck yourself<i>,</i>
and the horse you rode in on!"

893
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:10,183
And your mother and sister too<i>,</i>
you ugly son of a bitch!

894
01:17:17,963 --> 01:17:20,557
Stop! Study!

895
01:17:20,632 --> 01:17:22,224
Sit!

896
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:25,861
Study that poetry.

897
01:17:27,405 --> 01:17:31,933
We'll do the slippery later<i>,</i> right?

898
01:17:33,145 --> 01:17:37,013
Study<i>,</i> I'll be right back.

899
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:51,554
Yes<i>,</i> Prince?

900
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:53,291
Majesty<i>,</i>

901
01:17:53,365 --> 01:17:57,734
contrary to your wishes<i>,</i>
Tanucci has arrested

902
01:17:57,802 --> 01:17:59,793
everyone affiliated
with the Naples Masonic Lodges.

903
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:03,068
Many are your friends<i>,</i> Majesty.

904
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:05,632
It's not possible!

905
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:09,111
That's an insult to me
and to my mother<i>,</i> Maria Theresa!

906
01:18:09,181 --> 01:18:11,843
That stubborn King Carlo
thinks that Tanucci<i>,</i>

907
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:17,685
that old idiot<i>,</i>
can lead me by my nose!

908
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:25,388
Now we'll see!

909
01:18:29,134 --> 01:18:32,535
Your hardheaded father
has backwards ideas<i>,</i>

910
01:18:32,604 --> 01:18:36,802
as moldy as
that absolute Spanish Monarchy!

911
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:40,572
Watch out<i>,</i> you're offending my father!

912
01:18:40,645 --> 01:18:43,808
Wake up<i>,</i> Ferdinando.
Time goes on.

913
01:18:43,882 --> 01:18:46,146
This is the Age of Enlightenment!

914
01:18:46,218 --> 01:18:49,449
All kingdoms are discussing liberty!

915
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:52,422
The Masons must spread these ideas!

916
01:18:53,858 --> 01:18:56,326
Stop.

917
01:18:56,394 --> 01:18:59,124
Calm down or we'll have trouble!

918
01:18:59,197 --> 01:19:02,564
What calm?
He's arrested my friends.

919
01:19:02,634 --> 01:19:05,125
They must be freed now!

920
01:19:05,203 --> 01:19:10,971
The slave of Spain will pay for this
and apologize to me!

921
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:12,669
Maria Carolina's orders!

922
01:19:12,744 --> 01:19:15,736
- This is an order by Maria Carolina!
- You must be crazy<i>,</i> off your mind!

923
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:18,942
I give the orders!
I'm the King!

924
01:19:19,017 --> 01:19:23,351
No! I give the orders.
I am Queen!

925
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:25,355
No one laughs at Maria Theresa's daughter!

926
01:19:25,423 --> 01:19:27,891
Who'll they laugh at<i>,</i> me?

927
01:19:29,227 --> 01:19:30,057
Yes!

928
01:19:37,269 --> 01:19:41,069
- How is the Princess of Medina?
- As always<i>,</i> devoted to you.

929
01:19:41,139 --> 01:19:46,008
I miss her. Tell her to come hunting
in Caserta on Saturday.

930
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:50,241
The Queen is already furious
about the Masons!

931
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:51,839
I know<i>,</i> I know.

932
01:19:51,916 --> 01:19:53,440
Enough!

933
01:19:53,518 --> 01:19:56,646
My father in Madrid
exaggerated about the Masons.

934
01:19:56,721 --> 01:19:59,417
I'm the King!
I want to fuck!

935
01:19:59,491 --> 01:20:03,291
Tanucci<i>,</i> you will give the Queen
her apology!

936
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:07,263
She's dangerous<i>,</i> crazy
and she's taking it out on me!

937
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:09,323
She's Austrian!

938
01:20:09,401 --> 01:20:12,268
We'll have a Masonic Queen.

939
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:17,297
Her Highness is too fond

940
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:20,435
of social reform and progress<i>,</i> Majesty.

941
01:20:20,512 --> 01:20:22,878
Your Royal Consort

942
01:20:22,947 --> 01:20:28,044
mustn't raise herself higher than you

943
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:30,246
or I'll have to write to your father.

944
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:33,519
You'll write to my father<i>,</i>
he'll write to her mother.

945
01:20:33,591 --> 01:20:34,580
Shit!

946
01:20:40,965 --> 01:20:42,899
The Age of Enlightenment.

947
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:47,165
Diderot... Rousseau... Voltaire.

948
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:52,733
Let's hope all this illumination
doesn't cause a fire!

949
01:20:54,179 --> 01:20:57,273
That child in Naples understands nothing!

950
01:20:57,349 --> 01:20:58,543
Nothing!

951
01:20:58,616 --> 01:21:04,714
Throwing her husband out of bed
because of the Masons...

952
01:21:05,523 --> 01:21:08,048
is stupid!

953
01:21:08,126 --> 01:21:09,855
On the contrary<i>,</i>

954
01:21:09,928 --> 01:21:15,525
she should keep that monkey in bed
until she has a son!

955
01:21:16,835 --> 01:21:22,671
That is how empires are made!

956
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:31,309
You know Blessed Virgin<i>,</i>
Saint Eustachio<i>,</i> Saint Eusebio

957
01:21:31,382 --> 01:21:34,442
that I am chaste and pious.

958
01:21:34,519 --> 01:21:38,285
But that Austrian has enslaved my son

959
01:21:38,356 --> 01:21:42,554
with carnality to dominate him.

960
01:21:42,627 --> 01:21:46,119
I was forced to order Tanucci

961
01:21:46,197 --> 01:21:49,132
to distract him with another woman.

962
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,135
And this sad Borbone family tradition

963
01:21:52,203 --> 01:21:56,572
needs a Pompadour right now!

964
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:04,747
Most chaste Virgin<i>,</i>

965
01:22:04,816 --> 01:22:06,875
can you ever forgive me?

966
01:22:06,951 --> 01:22:09,476
Can you ever forgive me?

967
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:17,690
I'm a chaste man.
I know nothing of these things!

968
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:22,661
Did you remind him
that the Princess of Medina is favored?

969
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:28,468
His nephew's wife?
Not her<i>,</i> absolutely not!

970
01:22:29,774 --> 01:22:34,473
Where will she come from?

971
01:22:34,546 --> 01:22:39,142
With Carlo's international political ideas<i>,</i>

972
01:22:39,217 --> 01:22:40,878
Spain?

973
01:22:40,952 --> 01:22:42,078
England?

974
01:22:42,153 --> 01:22:43,381
France!

975
01:22:43,454 --> 01:22:46,548
France is full of new ideas.

976
01:22:46,624 --> 01:22:51,493
How could Carlo ask a Pompadour of me?

977
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:52,495
Of me?

978
01:22:52,564 --> 01:22:56,000
You're overreacting!

979
01:22:56,067 --> 01:22:57,864
These are libertine times.

980
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:02,873
Nod and ladies will run to the King's bed!

981
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:06,274
Just find the right one!

982
01:23:06,344 --> 01:23:08,904
One we trust.

983
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:12,438
We need an expert on indecency.

984
01:23:12,517 --> 01:23:14,849
I don't know anyone.

985
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:16,511
The Goudar brothers!

986
01:23:16,588 --> 01:23:19,955
I guarantee you can count on them!

987
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:27,130
<i>The Goudars are two Parisian adventurers</i>
<i>in Naples seeking their fortune.</i>

988
01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:30,759
<i>Handsome, elegant, clever bastards</i>

989
01:23:30,835 --> 01:23:33,861
<i>who own a very successful gambling house.</i>

990
01:23:34,906 --> 01:23:37,033
<i>Foreigners, gentlemen and rascals</i>

991
01:23:37,108 --> 01:23:40,544
<i>all go there to make easy money.</i>

992
01:23:40,612 --> 01:23:46,050
<i>We, at the Court, are kept out of it,</i>
<i>but aristocracy runs to Casa Goudar</i>

993
01:23:46,117 --> 01:23:49,780
<i>Everything happens there:</i>

994
01:23:49,854 --> 01:23:51,719
<i>Fortunes lost,</i>

995
01:23:51,789 --> 01:23:54,724
<i>passions flamed,</i>
<i>infidelities,</i>

996
01:23:54,792 --> 01:23:57,283
<i>bets, tricks</i>

997
01:23:57,362 --> 01:23:59,125
<i>and dangerous games.</i>

998
01:23:59,197 --> 01:24:03,930
<i>The money flows</i>
<i>so they keep it in check</i>

999
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:08,439
<i>When Galiani and San Severo</i>
<i>spoke of King Carlo's wishes,</i>

1000
01:24:08,506 --> 01:24:13,068
<i>the brothers understood</i>
<i>and offered a solution.</i>

1001
01:24:13,144 --> 01:24:17,581
<i>Sara, Angelo Goudar's fiery,</i>
<i>red headed wife,</i>

1002
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:23,178
<i>famous for her flaming forest</i>
<i>on her Venus Nest</i>

1003
01:24:23,254 --> 01:24:28,021
My dear Goudar brothers<i>,</i>
the trap is set!

1004
01:24:28,726 --> 01:24:31,923
The trap has succeeded!

1005
01:24:31,996 --> 01:24:35,932
When I told His Majesty that a Goudar
was undefeated at the Ensign game

1006
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,766
as foreseen<i>,</i>
he immediately wanted to challenge him!

1007
01:24:41,239 --> 01:24:44,299
Did he agree to come masked?

1008
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:47,435
- Tonight!
- Does he know I'll be masked?

1009
01:24:47,512 --> 01:24:50,037
The mask is his favorite part!

1010
01:24:50,114 --> 01:24:52,105
And he's a kind of fool!

1011
01:24:52,984 --> 01:24:55,043
What name will he use?

1012
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:59,215
It's wonderful: Cavalier Saint Gennaro!

1013
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:02,817
He thinks that's good luck!

1014
01:25:02,894 --> 01:25:05,556
You need to be irresistible!

1015
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:07,723
Angelo<i>,</i> I know.

1016
01:25:07,799 --> 01:25:12,998
You want me
to be like the Goddess Venus!

1017
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,370
A red Venus nest<i>,</i>
but we must play cleverly.

1018
01:25:18,443 --> 01:25:22,607
It's not easy
to become the King's favorite.

1019
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:27,640
The ambiguous arts must be used.

1020
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:28,981
Do you understand<i>,</i> my love?

1021
01:25:29,053 --> 01:25:35,151
Power is a game too<i>,</i>
it's just more refined.

1022
01:25:35,226 --> 01:25:39,720
It's a lake with a slimy bottom.

1023
01:25:39,797 --> 01:25:42,163
Love<i>,</i> you're a poet!

1024
01:25:42,233 --> 01:25:45,964
My sweet<i>,</i> Eros loves power and politics

1025
01:25:46,037 --> 01:25:50,167
as it loves shadows and corners<i>,</i>

1026
01:25:50,241 --> 01:25:53,369
the gorges<i>,</i> the darker spots<i>,</i>

1027
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:55,275
my sweet...

1028
01:25:57,215 --> 01:25:58,512
vulgarity.

1029
01:26:00,351 --> 01:26:01,443
Yes<i>,</i> my love.

1030
01:26:01,519 --> 01:26:07,014
This first time<i>,</i>
it's better he sees you nude.

1031
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:12,186
It's too erotic.

1032
01:26:14,365 --> 01:26:20,099
- He'll know it's a trap.
- Never. You're far too charming.

1033
01:26:36,354 --> 01:26:38,982
Cavalier Saint Gennaro has arrived!

1034
01:26:57,775 --> 01:27:00,767
- He's here. The King is yours.
- Go on.

1035
01:27:37,915 --> 01:27:40,383
Look who's here.

1036
01:27:49,961 --> 01:27:53,590
- Cavalier Saint Gennaro.
- At your service.

1037
01:27:53,664 --> 01:27:56,462
Make yourself comfortable.

1038
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:07,467
You're the one unbeatable at the Ensign.

1039
01:28:08,613 --> 01:28:12,140
- That's what they say.
- Shuffle the cards. Let's shuffle.

1040
01:28:16,721 --> 01:28:19,656
Don't worry<i>,</i>
we can't be seen from here.

1041
01:28:19,724 --> 01:28:23,592
Don't be afraid.
Nobody can see us here.

1042
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:26,687
The King is playing with one eye

1043
01:28:26,764 --> 01:28:29,528
and looking at Venus with the other.

1044
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:34,196
- What if he loses?
- No problem<i>,</i> Abbot.

1045
01:28:34,272 --> 01:28:36,706
Angelo will let him win.

1046
01:28:43,748 --> 01:28:47,081
- I beat your pants off.
- Touch√©.

1047
01:28:47,151 --> 01:28:49,676
You had a very lucky streak.

1048
01:28:49,754 --> 01:28:52,848
The Goddess Fortune loves you.

1049
01:28:52,924 --> 01:28:57,520
You are lucky.
Fortune is on your side tonight.

1050
01:28:57,595 --> 01:29:02,225
Lady Luck knows where to go.

1051
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,860
If you'd like another hand...

1052
01:29:04,936 --> 01:29:07,234
Yes<i>,</i> but...

1053
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:11,006
I'm a bit tapped. My silver is gone.

1054
01:29:11,075 --> 01:29:15,444
If there's something here
that interests you...

1055
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:22,378
That's my most precious possession.

1056
01:29:23,254 --> 01:29:25,279
Come on<i>,</i> sir.

1057
01:29:25,356 --> 01:29:29,156
Come on<i>,</i> give me the cards!
Let's see where luck goes!

1058
01:29:30,528 --> 01:29:33,497
As you wish<i>,</i> my knight.

1059
01:29:37,435 --> 01:29:39,062
Come on.

1060
01:29:40,137 --> 01:29:43,573
One... two... three.

1061
01:29:46,043 --> 01:29:48,068
Unbeatable!

1062
01:30:07,898 --> 01:30:10,093
I won<i>,</i> Cavalier!

1063
01:30:13,971 --> 01:30:16,872
You won again.

1064
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:24,574
You didn't gamble the painting<i>,</i>

1065
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:26,310
you gambled the lady!

1066
01:30:28,986 --> 01:30:30,886
I placed no such bet.

1067
01:30:30,955 --> 01:30:33,355
Forget that and take the painting.

1068
01:30:33,424 --> 01:30:35,187
No<i>,</i> sir!

1069
01:30:40,931 --> 01:30:42,455
That is the King's bet!

1070
01:30:44,602 --> 01:30:46,092
You cannot draw back.

1071
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:47,831
You. Majesty.

1072
01:30:47,905 --> 01:30:50,499
Majesty!

1073
01:30:52,176 --> 01:30:53,666
Have pity!

1074
01:30:53,744 --> 01:30:55,803
I beg of you.

1075
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:57,507
Sara is my life.

1076
01:30:58,482 --> 01:31:00,746
If you take Sara from me
I'll be a dead man!

1077
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:05,152
A bet is a bet.

1078
01:31:09,327 --> 01:31:12,763
Take me to the lady.

1079
01:31:14,465 --> 01:31:19,903
No faces now!
It's an honor. I'm the King.

1080
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:23,633
I am a King.
To a king nothing can be refused.

1081
01:31:25,643 --> 01:31:30,842
<i>What an ass</i>
<i>Was it a mandolin or violin?</i>

1082
01:31:30,915 --> 01:31:34,180
<i>From behind, Sara is a symphony</i>

1083
01:31:34,251 --> 01:31:39,951
<i>In front, she has so many gifts</i>

1084
01:31:40,024 --> 01:31:42,959
<i>I don't know where to start</i>

1085
01:31:43,961 --> 01:31:48,364
<i>She looks like a nymph, a naiad,</i>
<i>a sylph, a bacchante.</i>

1086
01:31:48,432 --> 01:31:50,559
<i>She's Christmas</i>

1087
01:31:50,634 --> 01:31:52,898
<i>She's springtime</i>

1088
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:56,770
<i>Summer, the sun and the seal</i>

1089
01:31:56,841 --> 01:32:00,572
<i>I didn't think about Carolina.</i>
<i>Betrayal</i>

1090
01:32:00,644 --> 01:32:04,410
<i>With that red Venus nest below...</i>

1091
01:32:04,482 --> 01:32:06,279
<i>what can a poor King do?</i>

1092
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:09,786
<i>That was the Demon's fire,</i>
<i>Mohammed's Paradise.</i>

1093
01:32:09,854 --> 01:32:13,881
<i>She raises the dead</i>
<i>and makes you want to sing</i>

1094
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:18,418
<i>But sing softly so Carolina won't hear</i>

1095
01:32:18,496 --> 01:32:23,297
Pompadour is Sara's inspiration tonight!

1096
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:26,063
Sara... she's a woman with great class.

1097
01:32:26,137 --> 01:32:28,605
Who'd have known that chambermaid

1098
01:32:28,672 --> 01:32:32,039
would be the King's lover someday?

1099
01:32:36,514 --> 01:32:39,779
Watch!
Look down.

1100
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:42,910
She's about to do Salome's pirouette!

1101
01:32:42,987 --> 01:32:45,421
- What's that?
- A secret.

1102
01:32:45,489 --> 01:32:48,117
No one can resist it.

1103
01:32:49,994 --> 01:32:55,296
<i>What is Salome's pirouette?</i>
<i>An absolute secret.</i>

1104
01:32:55,366 --> 01:32:57,960
<i>Julian Goudar let the secret out.</i>

1105
01:32:58,035 --> 01:33:02,131
<i>He told Countess San Marco.</i>

1106
01:33:02,206 --> 01:33:08,668
<i>And it didn't escape</i>
<i>my Sicilian Princess' eye</i>

1107
01:33:08,746 --> 01:33:12,477
<i>She bothered him</i>
<i>until she knew it all. Damn</i>

1108
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:17,044
<i>And she did not give up,</i>
<i>until she knew it.</i>

1109
01:33:17,121 --> 01:33:20,386
<i>When I brought her husband</i>
<i>back from London,</i>

1110
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:21,686
<i>all hell broke loose</i>

1111
01:33:21,759 --> 01:33:23,750
<i>She felt betrayed twice.</i>

1112
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:26,956
<i>For the wife, of course, is the wife.</i>
<i>But Sara</i>...

1113
01:33:27,031 --> 01:33:32,663
<i>She felt betrayed,</i>
<i>but Sara's red Venus nest called,</i>

1114
01:33:32,736 --> 01:33:34,829
<i>and she's jealous as a cat</i>

1115
01:34:20,351 --> 01:34:26,347
The Princess of Medina
is speaking to the Queen.

1116
01:34:26,423 --> 01:34:29,620
Let's hope she hasn't told her.

1117
01:34:29,693 --> 01:34:31,354
About the beautiful Sara?

1118
01:34:31,428 --> 01:34:34,226
I fear she's learning now.

1119
01:34:37,301 --> 01:34:40,498
She entered the King's favor
at the gaming house.

1120
01:34:40,571 --> 01:34:43,438
I have proof.

1121
01:34:43,507 --> 01:34:45,236
I don't believe it!

1122
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:10,896
I am not a stupid Othello
who kills for a handkerchief!

1123
01:35:10,968 --> 01:35:13,129
It's no handkerchief.

1124
01:35:13,203 --> 01:35:15,137
It's a snuffbox.

1125
01:35:24,715 --> 01:35:28,151
"Same place<i>,</i> same time.

1126
01:35:28,218 --> 01:35:31,585
Your impatient heifer

1127
01:35:31,655 --> 01:35:35,648
awaits her bull.

1128
01:35:35,726 --> 01:35:37,353
Sara."

1129
01:35:39,563 --> 01:35:41,690
[Austrian]

1130
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,292
Infamy!

1131
01:35:45,302 --> 01:35:47,532
I'm truly sorry.

1132
01:35:48,872 --> 01:35:55,072
I thought I was his only heifer<i>,</i>

1133
01:35:55,145 --> 01:35:56,976
but if it's not true<i>,</i>

1134
01:35:57,047 --> 01:35:59,914
it's a mere detail.

1135
01:36:01,285 --> 01:36:03,219
Do not put on that face!

1136
01:36:03,287 --> 01:36:07,121
A betrayed queen is different
than a betrayed servant.

1137
01:36:08,292 --> 01:36:12,729
Poor rascal<i>,</i>
his sin will cost him dearly.

1138
01:36:13,964 --> 01:36:16,296
He who sins must pay!

1139
01:36:21,005 --> 01:36:24,566
Now my hunting season begins.

1140
01:36:45,229 --> 01:36:48,960
Knowing your abilities<i>,</i>
we've been waiting weeks to see it.

1141
01:36:49,033 --> 01:36:50,364
Whatever do you mean?

1142
01:36:50,434 --> 01:36:55,565
- How you did it.
- The snuffbox!

1143
01:36:55,639 --> 01:36:56,901
Well played.

1144
01:36:56,974 --> 01:37:01,741
I'm Her Majesty's royal servant
and friend!

1145
01:37:01,812 --> 01:37:08,479
So you thought the Queen should know
about the games at Goudar's!

1146
01:37:08,552 --> 01:37:11,919
The King's favorite is Borbone tradition!

1147
01:37:11,989 --> 01:37:15,891
Her Majesty is 20 years old

1148
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,121
and her first and only love is the King.

1149
01:37:18,195 --> 01:37:22,791
And now you'll taste sweet revenge.

1150
01:37:22,867 --> 01:37:25,392
How wicked<i>,</i> My Lord.

1151
01:38:49,219 --> 01:38:54,851
The King knows about the Prince.
I fear he wants to kill the Queen!

1152
01:38:54,925 --> 01:38:57,917
- I fear he wants to kill the Queen!
- We must intervene.

1153
01:38:57,995 --> 01:38:59,553
Or a tragedy will occur.

1154
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:04,192
Between King and Queen
nothing is seen...

1155
01:39:04,268 --> 01:39:06,259
What can we do?

1156
01:39:06,337 --> 01:39:10,865
If the King feels he's been fucked<i>,</i>
we're fucked!

1157
01:41:06,356 --> 01:41:08,881
My love...

1158
01:41:10,794 --> 01:41:12,455
Ferdinando.

1159
01:41:12,529 --> 01:41:16,795
What did you say?

1160
01:41:17,735 --> 01:41:21,728
My love<i>...</i>

1161
01:41:23,073 --> 01:41:26,201
Ferdinando.

1162
01:41:31,615 --> 01:41:34,778
So<i>,</i> you're dreaming of me!

1163
01:41:34,852 --> 01:41:37,412
So<i>,</i> it's me.

1164
01:41:38,122 --> 01:41:40,352
It's myself.

1165
01:42:11,688 --> 01:42:15,055
<i>"Ferdinando, my love."</i>

1166
01:42:15,125 --> 01:42:20,927
<i>If she'd said her lover's name,</i>
<i>believe me, I'd have killed her.</i>

1167
01:42:20,998 --> 01:42:24,695
<i>But "My Ferdinando"...</i>

1168
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,395
<i>She fucked me again</i>

1169
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:28,961
<i>That Austrian bitch.</i>

1170
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:31,405
<i>Love, infidelity and politics</i>

1171
01:42:31,475 --> 01:42:36,037
<i>instead of strangling her that night.</i>

1172
01:42:36,146 --> 01:42:39,343
Carolina conceived that male heir

1173
01:42:39,416 --> 01:42:43,682
that allowed her to rule Naples.

1174
01:42:48,992 --> 01:42:52,291
We were beautiful<i>,</i> Carolina<i>,</i>

1175
01:42:52,362 --> 01:42:56,856
young and beautiful.

1176
01:42:56,934 --> 01:42:59,198
Open-handed.

1177
01:43:05,709 --> 01:43:07,301
He's too good.

1178
01:43:07,377 --> 01:43:09,311
He's a corpse!

1179
01:43:12,749 --> 01:43:15,081
It was her...

1180
01:43:16,086 --> 01:43:18,884
Carolina.

1181
01:43:18,956 --> 01:43:23,916
Maybe he should have strangled her
that night.

1182
01:43:23,994 --> 01:43:26,895
The fun ended in that moment

1183
01:43:26,964 --> 01:43:29,762
and God's fury began.

1184
01:43:47,684 --> 01:43:49,083
In that moment<i>,</i>

1185
01:43:49,152 --> 01:43:51,086
I see her young<i>,</i>

1186
01:43:51,154 --> 01:43:54,123
beautiful<i>,</i> appetizing<i>,</i>

1187
01:43:54,191 --> 01:43:55,988
With that tempting breast

1188
01:43:56,059 --> 01:43:57,651
a cream pastry!

1189
01:43:57,728 --> 01:43:59,855
A moment later<i>,</i>

1190
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:03,024
Carolina<i>,</i> old and dry!

1191
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:05,591
Her face in death!

1192
01:44:05,669 --> 01:44:08,866
What does she want of me?

1193
01:44:08,939 --> 01:44:12,375
She came to get me.

1194
01:44:12,442 --> 01:44:14,933
She came to get me!

1195
01:44:15,012 --> 01:44:17,105
She came to get me!

1196
01:44:19,349 --> 01:44:22,045
I died of fright.

1197
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:24,610
It was her right until the end.

1198
01:44:32,963 --> 01:44:35,363
Caroli!
