00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
MR

2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:17,963
Café Elektric
(The Love Exchange)

3
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:28,231
6 acts
based on the play by Felix Fischer

4
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:52,898
This film´s task is to show ...

5
00:00:53,215 --> 00:01:00,256
how easy it is in our times ...

6
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:07,552
to go astray from the right path,

7
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:14,173
how a neglected ...

8
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:21,507
... education can destroy a life.

9
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:28,719
It also shows us that it is possible ...

10
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:35,720
for a person fallen without guilt ...

11
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:41,287
... to find the way back to the light from darkness...

12
00:01:41,404 --> 00:01:46,493
... through true love.

13
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:49,471
Act One.

14
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:00,704
... Ferdl ...
[short for Ferdinand]

15
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:29,840
May I walk with you for a little while, Miss?

16
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:57,019
Help!
My bag!

17
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:39,582
The same afternoon at 5 o´clock tea.

18
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:59,723
Erni Göttlinger,
daughter of a construction tycoon.

19
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:18,746
My, you are going very fast.

20
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:30,160
Construction entrepreneur,
Commercial Councillor Göttlinger.

21
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:38,115
One of his girlfriends.

22
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:03,876
Construction engineer Max Stöger ...

23
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:27,509
The plane tickets I had bought for you.

24
00:07:53,332 --> 00:08:07,998
Shame, you come so rarely.  I´d like to hire you as an animator.

25
00:09:56,132 --> 00:10:01,250
My, you are going very fast.

26
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:16,060
When can I see you again?

27
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:26,024
Bring me back to my table!

28
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:32,025
... so if I may hope to have a chance with you ...

29
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,700
Keep hoping!

30
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:50,626
The Lady sends you this for the Black Bottom!

31
00:13:53,764 --> 00:14:01,923
In the evening, when the suburban streets awaken ...

32
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:10,318
and the lights go on in the little cafés ...

33
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,434
CINEMA

34
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:47,107
At least buy me a coffee.

35
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,251
Hansi ...
[short for Johanna]

36
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:58,012
This was where also Ferdl felt at home in the evening.

37
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:21,709
Dr. Lehner,
Doctor and philanthrope ...

38
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:29,618
held special sympathies for Hansi ...

39
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:22,866
So my little nightbird is out of money again?

40
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:40,597
How much did he give you?

41
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:58,446
Leave me alone!
It´s been over between us for some time.

42
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,940
Do you need money, Ferdl?

43
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:29,999
A little!

44
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:25,374
I have to see you today, Miss Erni.

45
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:35,015
But you have to promise to behave yourself ...

46
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:43,412
so it´s in 10 minutes down at the street corner.

47
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:18,507
We have to hurry, Miss Erni, it´s time for the theatre.

48
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:38,197
I´m sorry ... I can´t ... a friend suddenly got ill ...

49
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:49,917
You are not telling the truth, Erni.

50
00:22:55,198 --> 00:23:03,820
I don´t owe you an explanation!

51
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:31,507
Don´t be angry Max ...
I´m just nervous - the girl is seriously ill.

52
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:22,721
Wait here, then drive us to 12 Mayseder street without asking any questions.

53
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:30,569
Bring me a glass of the same stuff.

54
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:10,636
Bottoms up!

55
00:30:53,908 --> 00:31:02,358
I like to go the movies, it´s so beautiful there!

56
00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:10,741
They always get each other in the end!

57
00:31:59,927 --> 00:32:03,183
After the show.

58
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:58,757
Where can one meet you?

59
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:14,293
I´m at Café Elektric each night.  Just ask for Hansi ...

60
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:29,965
You´re a sweet little girl!  So ... see you ... tomorrow ... or the day after ...

61
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,519
The next morning.

62
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:30,980
What is it, Ferdl?  You´re in a bad mood?

63
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:48,645
I lost a lot at Bucki Domino ... I need money till afternoon!

64
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:14,262
Can you get it?

65
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,821
So that´s what your love looks like!

66
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:55,388
I´ll get it for sure!

67
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:42,951
Miss Erni did not come home last night ...?

68
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:55,445
Don´t worry!  Miss Erni is with a sick friend.

69
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:26,404
Your sick bed visit took some time.

70
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:46,567
I have to get 500 schillings ...
[Austrian currency at the time]

71
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:56,412
Please, wait in the office.

72
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:36,372
Give back the ring and the money!

73
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:49,268
It´s better if I help someone instead of dad giving it away!

74
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:04,139
Sorry, I left my keys.

75
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:17,857
My bag please, Mr. Engineer!

76
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:49,145
Mr. Göttlinger´s urgent business trips never lasted long.

77
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:59,050
In most cases he returned the next morning.

78
00:41:05,003 --> 00:41:08,916
Where is my daughter?

79
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:19,547
She is at a sick friend´s.

80
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:39,073
In the meantime, Ferdinand shortened the waiting time ...

81
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:47,523
by manicuring his "long" fingers.

82
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:01,870
You got it?

83
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:42,892
Don´t you listen?

84
00:43:59,318 --> 00:44:09,378
Why did you dress up like that?  Are you waiting for someone?

85
00:44:24,257 --> 00:44:34,366
I met such a lovely nice guy ...

86
00:44:44,508 --> 00:44:59,987
That´s just like you! You came across a "big love" again?! Nonsense!

87
00:45:49,307 --> 00:46:01,652
You´re a silly girl, Hansi. - We two could work out fine.

88
00:46:24,006 --> 00:46:29,565
... that might be enough to start with ...

89
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:44,063
... and later?  You could have many of those ...

90
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:09,473
Jesusmaryandjoseph!!
The thief!!!

91
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:36,749
Don´t make a fuss!  I´ll pay those few bucks.

92
00:47:46,835 --> 00:48:00,316
Keep it down or you will run into police trouble yourself.

93
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,661
The next day.

94
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:29,271
Mr. Zerner,
a business friend of Göttlinger´s.

95
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:47,850
Let´s drink on that deal tonight.

96
00:48:53,820 --> 00:49:00,872
Done! But somewhere with a mixed clientele.

97
00:49:06,912 --> 00:49:13,081
I know a "fine restaurant" just for that.

98
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:48,579
Strange, a ring vanished from the box.  Did you notice something?

99
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:58,272
There´s no one but you who has a key?

100
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:14,784
The cashier bears no guilt!

101
00:51:41,407 --> 00:51:46,217
How do you know, Mr. Engineer?

102
00:52:03,615 --> 00:52:09,126
I will find out!

103
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:41,291
Erni always found an excuse to be with Ferdl.

104
00:52:51,976 --> 00:52:58,614
I´d do anything for you!

105
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:07,793
ANYTHING?

106
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,068
Then come!

107
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:58,512
Don´t be afraid anymore, I gave the money to the girl.

108
00:53:58,687 --> 00:54:08,424
You´re going to the Elektric with me tonight.

109
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:18,892
With you of all people!

110
00:54:39,478 --> 00:54:45,056
Ferdl!  You got a new one?!

111
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:57,537
Yes, I got a new one.

112
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:19,192
But when you needed money I was good enough.

113
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,057
You wait, you jerk!

114
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:10,720
A hysterical woman stalking me out of jealousy.

115
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:33,303
Tonight we go to the Elektric.

116
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:38,487
Wherever you want.

117
00:57:21,415 --> 00:57:37,353
Ferdl isn´t here yet.
I´ll tell you when he arrives!

118
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:54,644
A nice ring!  If only it was genuine!

119
00:59:24,286 --> 00:59:25,256
Married?

120
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:39,648
That would be nice - but the likes of us never get out of the Elektric!

121
00:59:46,850 --> 01:00:02,295
And if someone might help you?  Would you be drawn back?

122
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:10,252
Back?  No ... never!!!

123
01:00:19,446 --> 01:00:36,033
Why do you burden my heart?  That can´t ever happen!

124
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:30,776
I want to check what pretty girls are here! They all have to come!

125
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:28,221
Ah ... Mr. Engineer.

126
01:02:30,811 --> 01:02:42,070
Mr. Göttlinger ... I ask you not to bother the lady anymore!

127
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:45,628
Haha ... Lady!!!

128
01:03:11,707 --> 01:03:16,068
You´ll pay for that!

129
01:03:28,813 --> 01:03:37,763
That is ... my ring, you fine gentleman!

130
01:03:46,519 --> 01:03:52,803
Who gave you the ring?

131
01:03:58,154 --> 01:04:01,339
That is him!

132
01:04:12,935 --> 01:04:20,569
He gave the ring to me!

133
01:04:51,747 --> 01:05:01,844
You ratted on me!  I´ll pay you back!

134
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:34,024
YOU ...!

135
01:05:36,993 --> 01:05:41,348
You´re coming with me!

136
01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:58,179
Come Hansi ... away from here!

137
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:39,615
You shall never
return to the Elektric!

138
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:49,674
Will you come to me ... forever?

139
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:38,320
You went stealing for that rascal?

140
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:52,576
You did that to me?  Me, your father?!

141
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:57,845
Father?!

142
01:07:59,716 --> 01:08:14,331
I never had a father!  You never cared for me.

143
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:40,679
... I tell you! I will always live like I want to!

144
01:08:40,834 --> 01:08:55,394
And you - take care of your affairs and don´t tell me what to do!

145
01:08:57,452 --> 01:09:05,358
Go! I don´t want to see you again!!

146
01:09:07,234 --> 01:09:08,195
Out!

147
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:41,333
Here you shall forget and be happy!

148
01:13:02,926 --> 01:13:08,884
They didn´t notice the china from Meissen.

149
01:13:37,049 --> 01:13:47,767
... old Dr. Lehner from the Elektric will surely buy it.

150
01:13:53,877 --> 01:14:08,455
Look, he´s really trying to get you a job with the Morning Post.

151
01:14:11,441 --> 01:14:27,290
You know that I don´t like you to meet people from the past.

152
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:13,411
I´ll go to the editor´s office to ask them again.

153
01:15:20,309 --> 01:15:31,548
You know, I have a feeling today´s my lucky day.

154
01:15:54,363 --> 01:15:55,688
Editor´s office.

155
01:16:12,021 --> 01:16:30,140
It´s no use coming here so often.  We´ll notify you if we need you.

156
01:17:31,743 --> 01:17:39,099
Haven´t we met before?

157
01:17:41,861 --> 01:17:43,918
At the Elektric!

158
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:54,586
How´s Stöger, your husband?

159
01:17:59,068 --> 01:18:08,076
He´s been out of work for a very long time now ...

160
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:25,355
... we´re not doing well ...

161
01:18:28,187 --> 01:18:38,196
And me, I have no education and ...

162
01:18:38,472 --> 01:18:49,363
... no matter how hard I try I won´t get a job.

163
01:18:59,533 --> 01:19:09,176
Maybe I can get your husband a job.

164
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:19,924
Tell him to come to my office at eight o´clock.

165
01:19:41,546 --> 01:19:45,812
Where do you live?

166
01:21:06,598 --> 01:21:09,243
Eight o´clock p.m.

167
01:21:17,803 --> 01:21:25,565
Please wait.  Mr. Zerner will be here soon.

168
01:21:50,734 --> 01:21:58,964
... but - he´s in your office right this moment.

169
01:22:07,518 --> 01:22:12,679
That´s why I came here.

170
01:22:56,645 --> 01:23:05,562
Don´t act so honorable all of a sudden!

171
01:23:38,893 --> 01:23:39,835
Help!

172
01:23:44,493 --> 01:23:50,013
If you don´t leave at once ...

173
01:23:56,815 --> 01:23:58,961
Not very clever!

174
01:25:38,549 --> 01:25:49,527
Dear Paula! I´m desperate.  Lend me some money,

175
01:25:50,034 --> 01:26:00,041
I have no other means.  I´ll wait outside. Hansi.

176
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:54,171
