He used to hold on my bum

You must have seen many
plays and magic tricks.

65
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,083
Now the trick which you
are going to see is nothing else.

66
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,958
This is a mango seed.

67
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,416
lf the mango seed is placed in the
hole where the basket is kept, then..

68
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,583
From that hole within
seconds this mango seed..

69
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,583
..and soon it would
transform to a mango tree.

70
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,208
Watch here.

71
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,291
Kept this, in this hole.

72
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,958
Covered it, up with basket.
Also covering it with this cloth.

73
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,083

82
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,749
Do you know Marcal Vogel?

83
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,124
No, but l can call him, sir.

84
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,624
Oh! Foolish devil he is a scientist,

85
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,458
Who invented red colour in television.

86
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,916
He says plants can
react to our thoughts.

87
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:54,041
Sir!

88
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:57,791
lf you don"t get a new product out of

89
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:00,416
Clean right has taken over

Gone?

93
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,083
So, you have decided to go for sure.

94
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,583
l hope you know the seriousness.

95
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,583
l feel it would be good if,
you take a second opinion.

96
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:59,499
You are also a doctor.
You give me a second opinion

97
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,083
Doctor, Krishnamurthy.

98
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,124
Are you sure? You want to go to
this place mentioned in this letter.

99
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,583
Surely, l should go.

100
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:15,291
Have you heard of Kopi Luwak?

101
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,708
World"s most expensive coffee.

102
00:14:18,542 --> 00:14:20,458
lt comes from animal excreta.

103
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:22,958
Do not wrinkle up your face.

104
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:25,708
Asian palm civet.

105
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,749
Asian palm civet. You know that.

106
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,083
lt"s found in lots of area including,
lndonesia.

107
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:38,249
And in lndonesia these Asian
palm civets eat coffee cherries.

108
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,874
Which partially
digest in their bodies..

109
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,416
..and they defecate it intact.

110
00:14:42,584 --> 00:14:45,999
And that partial digestion
adds flavour to it.

111
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:50,374
And it"s sold for hundreds of dollars.

112
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:51,249
Sir!
-Yes.

113
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:53,874

Don"t you guys go

115
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,749
That"s a kind of dung.

116
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:06,291
Waste dung, like useless cow dung.

117
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,499
So you better understand..

118
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,374
..the significance of animal
excreta and. - Oh! Escaped.

Foolish kids. Fit for nothing!

Damn fools!

What"s the matter today?

124
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:27,749
Leela Kumari, l might quit.

125
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:32,458
lt"s better than teaching
these worldly dumbs.

126
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,749
What is it? Tell the matter.

127
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,708
Leela Kumari,
you are a Â¤oology professor.

128
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:42,874
These animal excreta
and their specialties.

129
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,416
And their qualities, do you know that?

130
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:46,791
For that my PHD..

131
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,916
..isn"t like Neelakandan"s
in animals shit and urine.

132
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:55,708
You should know this.

133
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:59,124
Do you know what this is?
Crocodile shit. - Oh!

134
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,291
Do you know the uses of it?

135
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,083
During ancient ages.

136
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:07,624
Women in Egypt used
it as contraceptive.

137
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,416
Do you want to know how it is used?

138
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,208
No! l don"t want to know all that.

139
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,874
lt"s time for my class.

140
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,499
This too is a class.

141
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,291
Madam! There is a call for you.

142
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,499
Yes! Venkat.
- There is a call for you.

143
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:00,458
Yes!

144
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:08,083
Hello!

145
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:09,874
Madhu! Shilpa here.
- Yes.

146
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,749
There is some bad news.

147
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,749
We did our best.

148
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:17,583
Madhu as you know,
since Madhvi is no more.

149
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,958
Vivek has all the
rights to take away, Montu.

150
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,916
He was with me his entire life.

151
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,833
And only l know what
he wants and when he wants.

152
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:28,916
You know right, the law
doesn"t have such emotions, Madhu.

153
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,999
But.
- They have given us a date.

154
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,958
Can"t we try in a higher court?

155
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:39,083
We could, but the result
will be the same, Madhu.

156
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:43,124
lt will only cause
you more heart aches. Ok

157
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:09,999
Shit!

158
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,416
Sir! Tea.

159
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,458
Brother!
- What happened?

160
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,458
Don"t you get mobile signals here?

161
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,958
l think you will get at some distance.

162
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,083
Sir, have you come
to take photographs?

163
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,416
No. l"m actually a nature lover.

164
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,499
Simply came to explore the forest.

165
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:04,708
Thanks!
- lt"s okay sir.

166
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,083
How much?
- Five hundred.

167
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,499
Ammanpati?
Where is this Ammanpati?

168
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,416
Yes! This is that place.

169
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,583
Rest you can ask him.

170
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:26,749
Go dear.

171
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,374
l have told you earlier.
Forest, forest.

172
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:33,958
What forest man?
- Forest!

173
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,916
Seems like he too
belongs to the group.

174
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,124
No, that"s not, wait for some while.

175
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,916
Hey! lt"s enough say properly,
where to go?

176
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,416
lt"s the same said earlier,

He has no sense.

But the villagers said

Armed with a plunger he
stares down into the toilet bowl.

As the waste, he has just expelled.
Captivates him.

No sir, have seen in this mobile app.

Guess we would have covered
some 1 lakh 10 thousand steps.

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,791
Which would be approximately
16 kilometers. - Oh! Oh!

The village with lots of treasures,
which is not yet stolen by anyone.

276
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,499
But any time this
treasure could be robbed.

277
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:12,999
Forever this village could
be wiped off the face of the earth

278
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:16,624
As a single battler, l am helpless

Nothing sir.

295
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,916
The young generation of today, do not
have energy and stamina of your level.

296
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:35,249
Hat"s off to you sir.

297
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,749
By the way are you
here for an adventure?

298

l"m a fugitive. l have escaped a jail.

299
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,791
Jail? Which jail
have you escaped from?

300
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,916
A jail for people like us.
l escaped from there.

301
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:54,583
Reached here 5 years ago. Oh,
the five star facilities they provide!

302
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:01,874
l could not marry as l
was planning government strategy.

303
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:05,083
That"s why l did not
have children either.

304
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:10,083
When l reached my native place after
Retirement and commission service,

305
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,749
Those who l thought would look
after me, never even cared to do so.

306
00:29:14,459 --> 00:29:18,749
Anyways it was the right time, when
l got Philipose"s letter and money.

307
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,249
Then l didn"t think much.

308
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:45,999
Now l enjoy my freedom.

309
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:50,416
Sir, walk, walk.
- No chance.

310
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,458
Coming, coming, coming.

See! Lorry lorry. lsn"t that a road.

00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:15,374
Then we could have gone by road?

313
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,249
lf you go by road then
it would take 8 days.

314
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:19,833
lf we go by forest then within 3days,
we shall reach 7000 Kandi.

315
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:22,124
Only to trouble humans.
- 3 days?

316
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,083
We will have to listen to him..

317
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:25,791
..as we do not know
the geography of this area.

318
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,874

When l had gone to silent
Valley at the time of my research.

322
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,291
We had used similar beds.

323
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,749
Hey! This bed is for old man.

324
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,583
Hey! Brother help me.

325
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,249

Come, come let"s go

Shall we go?

336
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,958

Jump your suitcase.

00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,499
Will the suitcase jump on it"s own?

340
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:37,916
He doesn"t understand a thing.

341
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,499
Hey! Ananthuu, "petti chaduka"
means to throw the suitcase.

342
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,208
To throw the suitcase?
-Yes.

343
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,958
There will be long
distance to be travelled..

344
00:32:47,334 --> 00:32:48,583
..no need to carry huge weight.

345
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:49,791
He is asking you to
Lessen your luggage weight.

346
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,958
Carry only what is necessary

347
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:55,999
l had asked her not to pack so much.
She didn"t listen.

348
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:00,583
Stay there.

349
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:04,791
Shall we go?
- We shall go sir.

350
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,791
Let the suitcase be there, you come.

351
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:14,458
Brother! Why are you dumping
plastics in forest? - ls it so?

352
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,249
Please help me pick it. Pick it up.

353
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:17,083
Okay.

354
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,958
Come let"s go.

355
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:51,083
"little one has come descending the hills,
the woods danced flurtering it"s feathers"

356
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:58,124
"whom have you waited to welcome?"

357
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:03,749
"is it someone?"

358
00:34:06,459 --> 00:34:14,958
"the breeze waÂ¤ on palm leaves & flowers
bee searches for honey"

359
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,458
"very slowly humming a silent song"

360
00:34:19,167 --> 00:34:21,208
"slowly..."

361
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,958
l have to go Philipose.

362
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:27,416
Hmm. - He seems to
Be an interesting guy.

363
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:31,291
l too have noticed he is a survivalist
like we watch in discovery channels.

364
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:34,583
Service list?

365
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,624
l"m a big fan of Philipose.

366
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:40,374
Yes!.
- lt makes me very peaceful.

367
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:42,208
Even l have heard some of them.

368
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:45,916
Recently l have heard his composition.

369
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,916
OmVed, it has all
the elements of Jungle.

370
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,416
lt sound"s really interesting.

371
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:55,083
And his dessert mix it"s so awakening.

372
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:06,416
lt"s itching.

373
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,958
l feel it"s leech.

374
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:20,249
Aren"t you Swami? ls there no thread?
- What?

375
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,749
Thread.
- What?

376
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:24,583
l believe in science.

377
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:33,458
Who is this? ls he your son?

378
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:34,958
He is my nephew.

379
00:35:35,292 --> 00:35:37,041
Nephew? Who is that?

380
00:35:37,042 --> 00:35:38,624
Son of my elder sister.
- Oh!

381
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,916
What happened to him?

382
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:42,291
Montu!

383
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,958
The precious gift which
my sister had given me and gone.

384
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:48,208
He is the one who taught
me to love with open heart.

385
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:50,583
Montu! Will you not
go to school today?

386
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:53,958
His father went away saying, it
is difficult to bring up a sick child.

387
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:57,874
Even after 12 years..

388
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:03,708
..he is still like an infant,
wants me for everything. But..

389
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,124
One day, his father
came back to take him away

390
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:14,916
l had to let him go.

391
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:23,041
Hi Madhu, how are you doing?

392
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:24,916
Oh, you look disturbed.

393
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,249
l have heard about, Montu.

394
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:36,874
not even able to do minor things

395
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:15,083
Satisfied. Now it"s peaceful.

396
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:17,708
Why are you sitting like this?
They have gone.

397
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:20,458
Let"s go.
- Yes.

398
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,916
Ah! Watch out be carefull.

399
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,583
Listen, then.
- Yes.

400
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,374
My story is also somewhat like this.
- ls it? Yes.

401
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,208
ls it?
- Yes.

402
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:39,583
Me, l was.
- Do what l say.

403
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:42,083
l was supposed to go
to US but l didn"t want to go.

404
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,124
l was happy here,
doing my research and all.

405
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:48,999
My wife, Meghana
she wishes to live in US.

406
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:53,041
Don"t you have MS degree
from Colombia university and UCA.

407
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:54,291
lf you be there, how good..

408
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,499
No, sister for me.

409
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,291
Here comes my great lndia.

410
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,583
lt"s not too late Ananthu, after all.

411
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,458
You are one of the best
chemical engineers out there.

412
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:02,416
How much will you earn at Stanford?

413
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,499
This one is for Sita aunty.

414
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:06,583
Call as soon as you land in Dubai.

415
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:10,083
Later when you go to Frankfurt,
call me from there too.

416
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:14,458
Once you reach JFK, uncle
and aunty will come to receive you.

417
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,708
When l got this letter l came here..

418
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,291
..l did not think it
would be the same here.

419
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,083
Swami, who are you among this?
- What?

420
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,791
Her sister's son or she herself?

421
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:31,458
You have to be brave? Be courageous!

422
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,041
How will it do if you
leave all your wishes..

423
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:34,499
..because you are afraid of you wife?

424
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:38,416
Self-decisions,
it should always be quick.

425
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,916
So, is all you decisions quick?

426
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,083
This is the fifteenth time.
Fifteenth complaint!

427
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:47,583
Today also instead of the
lecture on protozoan Gambia..

428
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,499
..your lecture was
on Asian palm civet.

429
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,708
How old are you dean?
- Why?

430
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:52,958
No, just wanted to know.

431
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,916
l will turn 53 in this April.

432
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,749
Not on April 1st, is it?

433
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,583
Dean! You can shove this job.

434
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,499
l needn"t tell you where to.

435
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,791
Always your decision
should be fast and brave.

436
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:10,916
Did you understand?
- Yes.

437
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:12,749
Hey! Walk fast. Fast.

438
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,374
Why is it stinking all over?

439
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:10,583
See! The elephant has no tusk.

440
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:13,208
Thieves have taken it away.

441
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:15,124
These days they don"t
even spare elephants.

442
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:16,333
Dam! Poachers.

443
00:40:16,334 --> 00:40:18,291
Cruel devils, who don"t value life.

444
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:19,416
Come.

445
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,499
lt"s stinking too much. Oh!

446
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,999
How many days have you been waiting?
He won"t come.

447
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,208
Come! Come.

448
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,499
Come give me your hand.

449
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:38,999
Excuse me.

450
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:44,458
Come!

451
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,249
Careful.

452
00:41:48,334 --> 00:41:50,249
Come! Come.

453
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,416
Walk!

454
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,999
Watch out, carefully.

455
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,958
Yes! l know. l know.

456
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:10,499
Oh! No what happened?

457
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:13,249
Those are just bats.
Don"t be afraid friend.

458
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:18,624
Ananthu, why are you screaming
like a small child when you see bats.

459
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:20,458
lt"s bat, an innocent creature.

460
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:22,791
These vampire bats drink blood.

461
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,749
Oh! He says they drink blood.

462
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:30,791
Where were you Mr. Vedan.

463
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:32,999
ls it Phelopia?
- Yes!

464
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,249
l don"t eat fish.

465
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:35,708
Lake fish.

466
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:38,416
You can eat it,
where can you get such fresh ones?

467
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,083
Hot! Hot, hot.

468
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:05,708
Excuse me.

469
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:43,749
Riluzole. lt"s heavy dose.

470
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,458
Yes! lt is.

471
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:52,249
lt has been an important
part of my life since one year.

472
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:56,291
l cannot be, without it.

473
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:58,749
What"s your problem?
l have been noticing you.

474
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:03,749
Even l came to know it, a year back.

475
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,708
l have a disease like this.

476
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,583
MND, Motor Neuron Disease.

477
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:14,083
My muscles are getting
weaker day by day.

478
00:44:16,834 --> 00:44:19,083
lt"s seems only big people
get disease like this.

479
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:23,583
l believe Steven Hawkins
is also suffering from this.

480
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:26,499
l have always seen life positively.

481
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,916
For an extremely
outdoor person like me.

482
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,583
lt was as good as death.

483
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:33,249
Should you go?

484
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,416
lt"s a big risk.

485
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:37,708
You could collapse somewhere.

486
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,583
And you may end up
in a comatose state.

487
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:42,874
You have already told that,
my life will end up in 6 months.

488
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:44,458
Let me just enjoy it.

489
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,583
Sam, you should
know the seriousness.

490
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:49,291
Doctor, let him go.

491
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:52,124
Thank you.

492
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:55,083
l have always done
whatever l have felt.

493
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:57,999
And that letter has
made me come here.

494
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:00,499
And l really want to do this.

495
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:01,916
Okay!

496
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,416
You are in the right place,
at the right time.

497
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,583
Nature, is a great healer.

498
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,208
Thank you.

499
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:11,916
Sir! - Yes.

500
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,124
Look there.

501
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:23,791
Hey! Everyone come, come fast.

502
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,583
What? What happened?
- Come.

503
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,249
What happened?
- Lets see.

504
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,916
Oh! My God.

505
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:44,249
Wow!

506
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:49,374
lt"s amazing.

507
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:52,458
True!

508
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:58,374
Hey..Hey! Unbelievable!

509
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:22,749
Hmm..

510
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:32,874
Oh! No.

511
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,124
You will slip.

512
00:47:18,584 --> 00:47:19,374
What is he doing?

513
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:21,041
Now what happened?
You had said so much.

514
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:21,791
What?

515
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:41,958
Go away.

516
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:44,208
Hey! Be careful.

517
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,291
He doesn"t understand.

518
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:48,458
Don"t drown.

519
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,583
Crocodile!

520
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:57,208
Crocodile?

521
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,958
Oh! Crocodile, crocodile.

522
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:08,916
l"m not there. l"m going.

523
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:10,916
This man.

524
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:15,249
He was fooling us.
- Then what?

525
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:21,291
Come fast! lt"s 8"o clock.

526
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,999
You can say the time looking
at the sky? - There is a watch.

527
00:48:35,959 --> 00:48:44,666

Sometimes it could be blue balls,

Everything isn"t right,
whatever Menon sir has said.

640
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,208
Many things in my
blog are fictionalized.

641
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:27,083

desert mix.

642

Have been trapped in some
places with no humans and animals.

644
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:44,541
That too without
drinking water at times.

645
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:48,416
ln those days, l use to go
to any extreme to escape such traps.

646
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,124
Without fail l used to post
all travel experiences on blog.

647
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:58,499
l had to eat worms and the like.

648
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:05,916
Had to make a raft to cross a beach

649
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,958
And whatever things did to
escape such trap became survivalism.

650
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:15,749
To go and survive in any jungle

651
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:20,624
And also learnt to run and
escape in any emergency situations.

652
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:25,624
And once trapped in a net
which was laid for an animal.

653
00:59:26,167 --> 00:59:28,458
From there l met this Mountain tribe.

654
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:37,999
From there became my
constant travel companion.

655
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:39,833
And that"s how l became
his elder brother..

656
00:59:39,834 --> 00:59:42,374
..and he became my confidant.
l called him Mala.

657
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,083
And thus Mala took me to many forest
and hillocks which l hadn"t seen before.

658
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,458
Along with that Mala
told me about 7000 Kandi.

659
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:56,624
About those who get trapped in the
forest and cannot find their way out.

660
00:59:56,875 --> 01:00:01,749
About the hidden ghosts in the forest
and evil spirit those ablaze in night.

661
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:05,124
And heard many such
mysterious stories.

662
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,999
Only after gaining confidence over me.

663
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:13,916
Mala showed me the
safe routes to 7000 Kandi.

664
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:16,749
And disclosed many hidden
secrets about this place..

665
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:19,791
..when l learnt more
about 7000 Kandi.

666
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,749
l came to know about
the British history here.

667
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,791
149 years ago.

668
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:29,624
ln the era when places
like Ooty, Silion..

669
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,749
..and DaÂ¤eeling were
changing lnto tea gardens.

670
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:34,499
This place known as Parindhumudi.

671
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:39,083
Was noticed by a British company
named Lord Livingston Trading Company.

672
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:43,916
You must have seen their foundation
stone on your way. Didn"t you?

673
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,583
lt was sold for Â¤6
Rupees at that time.

674
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:50,708
Kozhipara Mana Datthan Namboothri..

675
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,749
..the one in charge
of the forest then,

676
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:55,374
Leased out this forest for 150 years.

677
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:58,416
As per the lease Parndhimudi
had to be converted..

678
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:00,916
..into a tea plantation or
any other industry within 150 years.

679
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:04,458
lf not..

680
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,083
Lord Livingstone
Company would lose it.

681
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:10,749
Only few months are left
for that agreement to get over.

682
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:14,124
So? What will happen it gets over?

683
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:16,583
Forest has to be returned
to lndian Government.

684
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,708
Few months back..

685
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:20,749
..when companies men
came here and tested the soil

686
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:24,958
They came to know that,
this forest has with rare minerals.

687
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:28,749
Like amaranthine,
bauxite, titanium and chromium.

688
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:33,291
Found out that there are so many
rare minerals and gems stone minerals.

689
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:36,249
From that day they started
mining and cutting down tress here.

690
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:43,874
while saying chopping the trees, in a day
they almost chop off atleast 5 hecters

691
01:01:53,834 --> 01:01:55,791
To know more about it..

692
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,958
..l went to meet Supreme Court
Environment issues laÂ¤er, Mr Venu Gopal.

693
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,749
Through him l came to know about
some hidden clauses of the agreement.

694
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,999
Within 150 years Parindhumudi.

695
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:11,499
lf turned into a tea plantation
or other industrial area then.

696
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:14,708
The lease could be
extended to 350years more.

697
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:16,749
Oh! ls it?

698
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,541
For that reason,
these contractors are in a hurry.

699
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:21,749
Oh! That was which
we saw while coming.

700
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,874
Carrying the chopped
trees in the lorry.

701
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:25,708
But, why are we here man?

702
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:28,916
For 7000 Kandi.

703
01:02:38,084 --> 01:02:41,749
lsn"t 7000 Kandi, a village.

704
01:02:50,292 --> 01:02:53,749
Okay! Before 2-3 centuries ago.

705
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:58,416
There was war between 2
rulers which lasted for 18 years.

706
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:02,208
See! This is the place where you saw
that Lord Livingstone"s foundation stone.

707
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:06,041
lt was 2 nearest ruling kingdoms then.

708
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:08,083
Singanagowla and Konacherinadu

709
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:13,749
These two regions were in constant
war which lasted for many years.

710
01:03:14,084 --> 01:03:16,916
A war which brought only losses

711
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:22,416
Ruling kings Thimmasara
Adhipan and Veera Raya Odheyan

712
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,999
Fought for land, earth and river.

713
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,708
After a long battle of 18 years.

714
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:29,708
Thimmasara couldn"t
overpower Singanagowla..

715
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:32,874
..it was understood by
the younger elderly person.

716
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,416
Kochirangandoth Parangodan.

717
01:03:36,834 --> 01:03:38,458
Parangodan"s intuition
did not go wrong.

718
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:41,249
Singanagowla started wining the war.

719
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:44,958
People of Konacherry slowly
stared becomes their slaves.

720
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:50,083
Parangodan preferred death to slavery.

721
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,458
With ghost, evil spirits and demons.

722
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:56,916
Parinthumudi was a dense
forest with black magic.

723
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,499
A place where no one could reach.

724
01:03:59,834 --> 01:04:03,416
Going to Parinthumudi
was considered equal to death.

725
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:07,791
Parangodan, who believed
that death is better than slavery..

726
01:04:08,084 --> 01:04:12,749
..along with his family and with
some disciples went into the forest.

727
01:04:13,834 --> 01:04:18,708
Following him, Small groups
of weavers, shepherds, potters.

728
01:04:18,709 --> 01:04:22,374
And people with other
skills ran into Parinthumudi

729
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:26,749
But instead of death what
they received in Parinthumudi..

730
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,249
..was a new life.

731
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:32,583
They understood that forest
protects and provides shade to man.

732
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:35,749
They made a village inside the forest

733
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:38,583
That Village is 7000 Kandi.

734
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,833
The villagers here believe that the war
between Singanagowla and Konacherinadi

735
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:45,083
ls still not over.

736
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:47,708
But where is it?
Where is this village?

737
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:53,124
Take a peak.

738
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:54,249
What is it?

739
01:04:54,459 --> 01:04:56,583
Oh! Periscope.

740
01:04:57,167 --> 01:04:58,291
Where did you get it from?

741
01:04:58,584 --> 01:05:01,416
l got it when a submarine
was torn apart in Alang.

742
01:05:05,709 --> 01:05:06,916
Move aside.
- This man.

743
01:05:08,334 --> 01:05:09,208
What is it?

744
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,999
Let"s see.

745
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:14,416
Come on.

746
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:47,124
Outer world denote them as ghost,
evil spirit, etc.

747
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:48,916
lf truly said they are not all those.

748
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:52,708
Very much nature lovers
and alert all the time.

749
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:58,416
Fearful to everything
and an innocent bunch of people.

750
01:06:58,709 --> 01:07:01,083
But some negatives that
are seen in between us are..

751
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:02,999
..the same with them too..

752
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:05,916
..aydhu, bheta, Tarler.

753
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:09,708
These are considered lower caste here.

754
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,208
But they are the shear
Existence of this village.

755
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,583
The people who drives
hunger out of the village.

756
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:18,333
Look! Did you see them catching fish.

757
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,499
They are Tarler,
a group who does hunting.

758
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:24,083
The village is guarded
by people of this caste.

759
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,499
Wow! We can hear their
sound in these speakers.

760
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:29,958
That is technology.

761
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:33,499
l have kept microphones in
many places without their knowledge.

762
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:38,291
lf we look at their weapons,
it seems to be of ancient ages.

763
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,416
But, Sam they use
weapons only for hunting.

764
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:46,249
They don"t have an
enemy country to fight with.

765
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:49,249
Because of that there are
not many changes in their weapons.

766
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,083
Watching them seems like reading
TaÂ¤an"s comic. Very gymnastic.

767
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,583
Till now l haven"t seen
any one falling from tree.

768
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:59,458
Or being hurt.

769
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,999
These trees a part of their family.

770
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,458
Hey! Come, come!

771
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:06,249
Fast, fast.
- Coming.

772
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:08,249
Namda! Come this way.

773
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,749
Fast.

774
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:13,583
What are they putting
into those baskets?

775
01:08:13,959 --> 01:08:15,624
Madhu! That"s the funny part of it.

776
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:18,499
They are giving food
from to Madhyamadhi.

777
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:20,791
This is what l told earlier,
negativity.

778
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,916
The similarities between them and us.
The caste differentiation.

779
01:08:28,209 --> 01:08:29,791
Didn"t you see this village?

780
01:08:30,459 --> 01:08:32,083
lt"s in three different levels.

781
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,916
Kelamadhi, Madymadhi, Mukhaymadhi.

782
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,374
This is all over eveÂ¤here.

783
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:40,916
Where? Let me see.
-Yes!

784
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:43,249
Kunjathan and Karyathan

785
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:45,499
The eyes of 7000 kandi.

786
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,916
They are watching me the same
way from the time l have come here.

787
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,749
They must have followed
you too when you had come.

788
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:59,749
There is complete
industrial revolution here.

789
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:01,499
This is Madhymadhi.

790
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:05,708
All are self-sufficient.
- Here are the weavers and the potters.

791
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,499
People in Kelamadhi
should not enter Madhymadhi.

792
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:12,249
Oh! Oh! Cow dung rolls.
Very interesting.

793
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:14,708
Who is that?

794
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:16,749
That is Neeli.

795
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:19,291
And this is Kariyan. The blacksmith.

796
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,583
Belongs to Kabanar caste
making weapons for Kelamadhi caste.

797
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,583
lt"s long time that blacksmith
has started flirting with..

798
01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:27,624
..Thiritha from Mukhara caste

799
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,999
But here also the same social stigma.

800
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,374
There should be no marriage"s
between these two castes.

801
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,499
Mangalam? What"s that?

802
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:34,874
Marriage.

803
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,083
What are they filtering there?

804
01:09:37,584 --> 01:09:39,708
People who have taken collection
as their hereditary work.

805
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,291
The people from arms department.

806
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:43,458
They are collecting
metal ore for blacksmith.

807
01:09:47,334 --> 01:09:50,249
Didn"t you see the water ways?
lt"s lnnyappa"s creations.

808
01:09:56,084 --> 01:09:57,916
He seems to be an
adventure junky like me.

809
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,333
That"s lnnyappa.

810
01:09:59,334 --> 01:10:01,708
He is the chief
engineer of 7000 Kandi.

811
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:04,583
He has the responsibility
of the village"s maintenance.

812
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,499
All the machines seen
here are his inventions.

813
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,499
This is Madikaer portion.

814
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:12,749
ln Hindi "Madke" means mud pot.

815
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,958
See Kunjathan and Kariyathan
have reached down.

816
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:21,416
Put.

817
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:35,999
North! South!

818
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:38,124
Look, Look! See.

819
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:40,583
They might be the roadside Romeo here.

820
01:10:40,834 --> 01:10:43,624
lt is said that if lacuna bean is
Ripened the itchiness will increase.

821
01:10:43,834 --> 01:10:46,999
Watching North and South
even at old age. ldiots!

822
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,708
What are they drinking?

823
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:50,041
Some kind of alcohol?

824
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:52,083
lt"s their spirit. Matth!

825
01:10:52,334 --> 01:10:53,499
Matth?
- Yes.

826
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,291
Madhu! Come and see.

827
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,124
What are they spiting.

828
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,083
That is a kind of tuber crop.

829
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:02,583
Here is the irony. Though they
are not allowed to touch each other.

830
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:05,958
lt is from the juice of what
these lower caste ladies spit.

831
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:09,208
That The Matth for Mukhyamadhi
and Madhyamadhi is made.

832
01:11:10,584 --> 01:11:12,999
That is Pargangodan,
the wise men of this place today.

833
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:17,999
Main activity is wasting time just
playing around and losing every time.

834
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,124
Oh! l forgot to say.

835
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:23,499
This is a matriarchal society.

836
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,541
This is Meenkanni,
Pargangodan"s niece.

837
01:11:26,542 --> 01:11:28,708
You can even say the
Mother of ancestral house.

838
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:30,416
She is very naughty? lsn"t she?

839
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:33,416
Ponni! Younger sister of Meenkanni.

840
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:35,249
Next in the line to be
mother of ancestral house.

841
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,749
She doesn"t care about
the caste and race systems here.

842
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:40,374
Goes eveÂ¤here and touches
everyone.- Sister is calling.

843
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:43,624
Because of her all children
here from all caste can go anywhere.

844
01:11:51,334 --> 01:11:52,958
How many times have l told?
How much have l warned?

845
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:54,249
Your Legs will rot.

846
01:11:54,584 --> 01:11:56,749
You should come before called.
Take her along.

847
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,499
Meenkanni is a tough nut.

848
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:02,958
There is no word called mercy
and compassion in her vocabulary.

849
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,083
They may be primitive.

850
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:10,624
But They have their own fashion style.

851
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:12,291
And A stylist.

852
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:14,083
That is Cherkun!

853
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:15,916
And the other one is his assistant.

854
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:18,249
l haven"t understood his name.

855
01:12:19,834 --> 01:12:21,583
That man is in a bird nest? lsn"t he?

856
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:23,999
Oh! That is the jail here.

857
01:12:24,334 --> 01:12:25,916
The man in the jail is Aaythan.

858
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,749
He tried to steal "Pala-pala"
for his second marriage.

859
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,999
That is his family,
have come to give him food secretly.

860
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:35,499
Madhu just look upward.

861
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:38,083
That house seen is Gugutai"s hut.

862
01:12:38,292 --> 01:12:39,583
lt"s a strange hut?

863
01:12:43,709 --> 01:12:45,416
Ah! Here she is!

864
01:12:46,584 --> 01:12:49,249
lf anyone new comes in this forest,
Gugutai will come to know about it.

865
01:12:50,375 --> 01:12:51,124
How are you?

866
01:12:51,334 --> 01:12:54,749
Gugutai is the astrologer
and weather predicator here.

867
01:13:02,584 --> 01:13:04,416
Are you a thief?

868
01:13:05,084 --> 01:13:06,749
She is also the doctor here.

869
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:09,499
You can call her a witch doctor.

870
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,749
Are you a girl?

871
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,874
Bear or monkey?

872
01:13:33,584 --> 01:13:35,541
Gugu is Vedan"s smoking companion.

873
01:13:35,542 --> 01:13:38,208
Ours one and only connecting
link with 7000 Kandi.

874
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:40,916
And this is Chatha Gugu"s apprentices.

875
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,916
Went away?

876
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:48,583
They come and go
according to their will.

877
01:13:48,584 --> 01:13:51,416
l Came to know more about This
village"s history through Gugutai.

878
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:55,499
Different libraries and archives
Could give only little details.

879
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:57,208
Rest are all assumptions.

880
01:13:57,209 --> 01:13:59,249
Can"t you make it public
that there is such a village?

881
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,499
lf l reveal it, press will come.

882
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:04,749
lt will become tourism and
these people will be mocked at..

883
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:07,791
..7000 Kandi"s way of
living will be destroyed.

884
01:14:08,042 --> 01:14:11,291
Have you approached the
Environment protection force?

885
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,708
Tried everything.
- How?

886
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:20,624
Environment departments in Kerala,
Tamilnadu and Karnataka.

887
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:23,791
And also went to their
department sectaries.

888
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,083
There were no benefits
other than giving bribes.

889
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:28,499
See Mr.Philipose.

890
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,083
The forest you are talking
about is not just in my jurisdiction..

891
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:32,416
..it"s across 3 states.

892
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:35,499
Well, apart from this
can l help you in anyways.

893
01:14:35,792 --> 01:14:37,208
Sir, before this you.

894
01:14:37,209 --> 01:14:41,124
To protect the forest l had
gone to some 3rd rate politicians.

895
01:14:41,334 --> 01:14:43,499
lt will be a great help if you agree.

896
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:47,749
For all these you require lots of
time and money, but have time for it.

897
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,999
When is that meeting?

898
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:50,416
lt"s after half an hour.

899
01:14:50,667 --> 01:14:53,583
But villager's petition
against this forest has gone.

900
01:14:54,334 --> 01:14:56,416
They believe that
the forest is haunted.

901
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:58,874
l had lot of expectation in you sir.

902
01:15:01,209 --> 01:15:02,124
Thank you!

903
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:03,833
Then l went to..

904
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:07,499
..many Hypocrites who call
themselves social activists.

905
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:10,041
They were only interested
in those activities..

906
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:12,291
..which would give them
instant fame and goodwill.

907
01:15:12,584 --> 01:15:16,374
As a last ditch effort l
went to those Mangalore brothers.

908
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:19,583
l went to the contractors,
and pleaded to them.

909
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,374
There is justice in what they said.

910
01:15:21,667 --> 01:15:23,499
They aren"t doing anything illegally.

911
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:26,083
See Mr Philipose, we are business men.

912
01:15:26,292 --> 01:15:28,416
And we have invested
lot of money in that project.

913
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:30,749
So, we have continue the work.

914
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,749
Remove at least 20 from there.

915
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,499
Did you understand brother?
Understood?

916
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:42,499
Sir, this isn"t a normal forest.

917
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:45,249
lt"s a reserve forest
and it should be protected.

918
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:48,833
For that Green Tribunal had objection.

919
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:51,416
lsn"t it?
Haven"t we paid the Tribunal..

920
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:53,999
..and various environment departments.

921
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:56,374
So you may empty the space.

922
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,416
Don"t waste my time.

923
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:02,583
Sorry Mr, everyone is not like that,
there are nature lovers too.

924
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,499
Have some heart, Guru.

925
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:07,874
Look, Mr. Nature lover
you may please leave.

926
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:09,958
Carry on with your love for nature.

927
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:11,499
Rest we shall look after.

928
01:16:13,334 --> 01:16:15,208
Tried protesting by
being on hunger fast..

929
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,249
..it did not help either than l had
to stay empty stomach for 3-4 days.

930
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:31,999
Don"t pick me up. Me!

931
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:48,916
Eat the rest.

932
01:16:49,334 --> 01:16:52,916
When all my efforts failed,
as a last attempt.

933
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:54,208
l wrote letter's to you all.

934
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,749
A gamble for man power.

935
01:16:57,167 --> 01:17:00,208
A play with the last 1 .5
lakh rupees in my bank account.

936
01:17:00,542 --> 01:17:01,999
l had written letters to 100 people..

937
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,583
..about who l had
noted down in my dairy.

938
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:06,416
l expected at least 50 people.

939
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,083
l"m helpless.

940
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:13,458
So, now what can we do?

941
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,833
We are only few people.

942
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:18,958
We could have done something
if we were a few more in number.

943
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:22,583
But, l cannot abandon
these villager's.

944
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:26,124
lf the forest is destroyed,
there won"t be a life for them.

945
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,583
Because they only
know to live like this.

946
01:17:29,875 --> 01:17:31,208
Their innocence.

947
01:17:31,459 --> 01:17:33,291
There are no diseases which
are known to outer world..

948
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:34,708
..and there is no taint.

949
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:38,458
The only problem is that they
don"t have unity among themselves.

950
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:42,249
To give light everyday
Velliyyal climbs up.

951
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:45,791
Earlier there was a deity here.

952
01:17:46,459 --> 01:17:49,749
Later when that tree grew,
it grew along and reached on top.

953
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:53,874
That is their deity now, Thaiyadhe.

954
01:17:54,875 --> 01:17:57,708
Now these are my
apprehensions concerns.

955
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:00,583
Before 7000 Kandi
is completely destroyed.

956
01:18:01,084 --> 01:18:03,749
Will l be able to
make them understand?

957
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:08,083
Or without knowing anything
will this 7000 Kandi get..

958
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:10,124
..perished along with the forest.

959
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:13,083
lf we go according to the
number of trees they are chopping..

960
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:14,499
..within no time they will reach here.

961
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:15,999
Then, within few days.

962
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:18,583
This 500 year old village will perish.

963
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,916
But what could a few people do,
it"s a waste of time.

964
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:23,124
He is right.

965
01:18:23,334 --> 01:18:26,583
Anyway, l won"t leave
them even if you leave.

966
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:29,583
This is their forest

967
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:32,291
Where will they go and live
if they are thrown out from here.

968
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,499
Brother! l"m with you man don"t worry.

969
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:40,999
Thanks!

970
01:18:42,834 --> 01:18:45,708
Okay! Anyways we will see tomorrow.

971
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:47,916
Can stay here tonight.

972
01:18:49,334 --> 01:18:50,749
There are hammocks outside.

973
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:53,124
Those who want to
go can leave tomorrow.

974
01:19:03,584 --> 01:19:05,458
Tied well, isn"t it?
- Yes

975
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,708
This will not break. Sleep.

976
01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:22,958
Sir, you can sleep in my bed down.

977
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,291
Thank you, thank you very much.

978
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:24,874
Okay!

979
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:49,499
My god!

980
01:21:12,584 --> 01:21:13,416
Kandiappa!

981
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,499
What is this?

982
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:18,583
Look! That"s my Â¤shirt.

983
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:21,958
Don"t be afraid they
7000 Kandi"s children

984
01:21:23,209 --> 01:21:24,458
Hello! Ponni!

985
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:26,791
Madhu! Meet Mr Glappan.

986
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,624
What?
- Glappan

987
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,916
Glappan.
- Glappan.

988
01:21:32,209 --> 01:21:34,583
Glappan.

989
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:36,499
Glappa, let"s go!

990
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:37,708
Kurma, walk fast

991
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:39,416
Hey! Give my Â¤shirt and go.
- Come fast.

992
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,583
Went away.

993
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:45,499
Good morning!
- Good morning.

994
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:46,124
Morning Sir!

995
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,499
Good morning everybody.

996
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:49,499
Good morning!

997
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:52,916
Hello!

998
01:21:54,834 --> 01:21:55,249
Give it to me.

999
01:21:56,167 --> 01:21:56,624
No matter, sir!

1000
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:57,291
lt"s okay!

1001
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,416
You say!

1002
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:15,499
Yaamba! - Amblee. Yaamba!
- Amblee.

1003
01:22:16,334 --> 01:22:17,291
l think the game has begun.

1004
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,583
Don"t you want to see?
Kakapooi has started playing.

1005
01:22:18,584 --> 01:22:19,499
Kakapoyee?

1006
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,916
lt"s the name of the person
playing along with Pargodan.

1007
01:22:22,292 --> 01:22:24,541
Playing along are
Vellayal and Chakanja.

1008
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:25,499
They are Pargodan"s ministers.

1009
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:29,374
The healthy fellow sitting behind ls
Hidumbi, Pargangodans younger brother.

1010
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:30,416
He is a glutton.

1011
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,124
What is that thing?
Those blue and green ones.

1012
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:37,124
Those are the Pala-pala,
colourful stones..

1013
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:39,249
..we get them from the
blue lake you saw on your way.

1014
01:22:39,542 --> 01:22:42,124
They are worthless but
if you want to marry here.

1015
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:44,416
You need to give women,
a set of pala pala.

1016
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:47,624
Ambli, ambli.
- Come come.

1017
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,416
Kakapayee one more time.

1018
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,458
That"s not right.

1019
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:57,583
Everyday it"s a foul play.

1020
01:22:58,209 --> 01:23:01,583
Our Kakapoyee has all
attention on Meenkanni.

1021
01:23:02,334 --> 01:23:05,416
Only if he wins and gives her
a set of pala pala can he marry her.

1022
01:23:05,667 --> 01:23:08,583
And if you lose you will
have to keep the horny fruit.

1023
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,958
After keeping it
repeatedly Pargangodan..

1024
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:12,708
..and chakanja have
difficulty in walking.

1025
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,208
Why isn"t anyone ready yet?
Don"t we have to go back?

1026
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,458
Come we will get late otherwise.
There is a travel of 2-3 days.

1027
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:29,249
Okay!

1028
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:30,624
Anandu will drop you.

1029
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,624
Who?

1030
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,083
The mountain tribe.
- We aren"t coming.

1031
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,583
You may go.

1032
01:23:38,834 --> 01:23:40,083
No, l will go only with you.

1033
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:41,916
l need to get fresh.

1034
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:45,291
There is a river nearby.

1035
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:47,749
Okay!
- Go and see.

1036
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,499
l"m stuck.

1037
01:23:56,334 --> 01:23:58,791
l Don"t know where to start from.

1038
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,249
Curiosity.
- Curiosity?

1039
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,083
Create curiosity.

1040
01:24:03,334 --> 01:24:05,291
A weapon to attract humans.

1041
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,083
Sir! what are you intending.

1042
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,916
You will get to know. Philipose.

1043
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,624
What is the way for it.

1044
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:16,124
Where is the treasure?

1045
01:24:17,209 --> 01:24:18,083
Treasure?

1046
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:22,374
lt was mentioned in the letter.
About a treasure.

1047
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:26,416
Treasure..This village
is the treasure.

1048
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:27,916
Village?
- Yes!

1049
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:32,458
This is a kind of fooling man.

1050
01:24:33,584 --> 01:24:36,124
So he came so far in
search of some treasure?

1051
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:42,083
Come fast.
- Come, come.

1052
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:51,874
l"m very irritated.

1053
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:54,624
l don"t give my dress
for anyone to wear.

1054
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,583
So this was the treasure
mentioned in the letter.

1055
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:11,416
So what did you think and come here.

1056
01:25:12,584 --> 01:25:13,583
Give that one.

1057
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:16,958
l was actually supposed to go.

1058
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:18,249
Then why didn"t you go?

1059
01:25:20,334 --> 01:25:22,583
The thought of leaving
all of you held me back.

1060
01:25:27,084 --> 01:25:27,916
lt"s tingling.

1061
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:35,083
Glappaa!

1062
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,958
l know Shamshu brother very well.

1063
01:25:57,334 --> 01:26:00,291
His Great mango tree act.

1064
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:02,291
l have seen.

1065
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:03,749
He is my father.

1066
01:26:05,334 --> 01:26:07,916
Why didn"t Shamshudin come?
- He asked me to escape.

1067
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:11,416
Escape? Murder?

1068
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:15,499
l hit some people who
couldn"t treat women well.

1069
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:17,291
Now you are going to watch.

1070
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:21,208
l was living in my
homeland doing petty jobs.

1071
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:24,708
Could be because l do
not have a mother or sister.

1072
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,749
lf anyone speaks ill about women,
l lose my marbles.

1073
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,958
You just wind up everything. Fast.

1074
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,499
l will come back now.
What happened?

1075
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,958
There is no time,
Shamshu brother come fast.

1076
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,749
When that monster did that
in front of me, l whacked him.

1077
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:39,374
Doing all such notorious deeds,
police is following you.

1078
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:42,916
Bheraan! Bheraan. Wake up.

1079
01:26:44,167 --> 01:26:46,999
Bheraan, wake up!

1080
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,749
Leave the place as soon as possible,
police will come now.

1081
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:51,791
Make it fast, Saidhuali is no more.

1082
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,958
Saidhuali?

1083
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:53,916
The person whom you whacked yesterday.

1084
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,124
l will call.
- Okay!

1085
01:26:59,459 --> 01:27:02,208
lt was later that l noticed
the letter inside the box.

1086
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,249
Then, l headed here.

1087
01:27:07,542 --> 01:27:09,083
Did that man die?
- No idea.

1088
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:13,583
Don"t you remember
Shamshu brother's magic.

1089
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:24,416
Give me that mug.

1090
01:27:24,834 --> 01:27:27,249
Let me see if l remember anything
l"d learned when l was a kid.

1091
01:28:19,584 --> 01:28:21,124
Run fast boy!
- Fast, fast.

1092
01:28:21,334 --> 01:28:22,291
Run fast

1093
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:04,749
Watch that.

1094
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:32,583
Smoke! Smoke!

1095
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,749
Fire! Fire.

1096
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:49,999
lsn"t it enough.

1097
01:29:50,459 --> 01:29:53,083
You haven"t forgotten?
- Remember certain things.

1098
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:09,958
The magic has worked out.

1099
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:12,291
You"ve made them curious.

1100
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:16,374
Now, we need to find ways
to attract other villagers.

1101
01:30:19,167 --> 01:30:20,416
l have an idea.

1102
01:30:21,459 --> 01:30:23,749
Don"t know whether it will work.
- What is it?

1103
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,249
l used to play a note.

1104
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:41,083
And they respond to it.

1105
01:30:41,334 --> 01:30:42,916
Why don"t you try it then?
- Yes!

1106
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:08,791
Why did you stop? Continue it.
- Yes!

1107
01:31:09,834 --> 01:31:11,708
l had composed a track.

1108
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,624
A bit boring though. But let"s try it.

1109
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,416
Guys please! Come and watch this.

1110
01:31:51,584 --> 01:31:52,416
Come.

1111
01:31:52,584 --> 01:31:55,291
Hey! Anandu. Hey!

1112
01:31:56,167 --> 01:32:00,374
"A new song has emerged here"

1113
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:03,374
"will there be a tune out of dreams"

1114
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:08,916
"it is a change from top to bottom here"

1115
01:32:10,834 --> 01:32:14,458
"today we are one body and one soul"

1116
01:32:14,459 --> 01:32:17,958
"we shall write ballards"

1117
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:25,541
"from your beauty arises small stars"

1118
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:28,124
"someone is singing"

1119
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:06,499
"we shall unite into one"

1120
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:10,166
"shall see and know unknown sights"

1121
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:17,208
"the body is antoxicated
with spirit, so as the soul"

1122
01:33:17,209 --> 01:34:02,916
"stars are singing"

1123
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:27,416
Hey! Help!

1124
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:30,208
Sam!

1125
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:57,249
Hey! Where are you going
With this baggage? Are you leaving?

1126
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,749
Going to keep it in sun light..

1127
01:36:00,209 --> 01:36:01,291
lt hasn"t received
any sunlight for days.

1128
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,291
What?

1129
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:06,583
Sunsign! Box! To show it.

1130
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,916
Sunsign? Box?

1131
01:36:10,834 --> 01:36:12,083
Stupid fellow!

1132
01:36:18,834 --> 01:36:21,083
Your hair has spoiled, let me see.

1133
01:36:31,334 --> 01:36:35,916
Shall l show you a trick?

1134
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,708
Shall l show?

1135
01:36:40,167 --> 01:36:42,749
There is a Jin, inside this box.

1136
01:36:44,334 --> 01:36:45,583
Puppy!

1137
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,749
What is that?

1138
01:37:06,542 --> 01:37:08,708
Okay! Then catch it, catch it.

1139
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:11,749
Okay! Then shall l go? Nabesukutty?

1140
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,083
Neelan!
- Yes! Got it.

1141
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:15,458
The same result.

1142
01:37:15,667 --> 01:37:18,958
Mobile phones can be charged
using solar energy, isn"t it?

1143
01:37:19,209 --> 01:37:20,249
Why not?

1144
01:37:23,709 --> 01:37:25,749
Look it"s perfect.
- Wait.

1145
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:30,083
What should be done
for a bar to appear in this?

1146
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:31,416
Mr Beraan.

1147
01:37:31,667 --> 01:37:35,624
lf you go up on the rock
you will get some range. - Oh!

1148
01:37:39,334 --> 01:37:41,583
Okay! Here you are!

1149
01:37:41,834 --> 01:37:43,208
Hi!
- Hey! Sam.

1150
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,916
The man has changed completely.

1151
01:37:48,834 --> 01:37:52,374
l feel like a new man.
l feel so rejuvenated.

1152
01:37:52,792 --> 01:37:55,958
l"m at the right place
as you said the other day.

1153
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:58,458
Thank you! Sir. Thanks for everything.

1154
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:01,874
There are many such hidden secrets
in this forest which are unknown.

1155
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:05,416
Right! There could be many treasures.

1156
01:38:05,584 --> 01:38:06,291
That"s it..

1157
01:38:06,459 --> 01:38:09,374
..it would be good if everyone
understands it and act accordingly.

1158
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:10,749
Yes! Yes!

1159
01:38:12,334 --> 01:38:14,208
He did not die.
- Die?

1160
01:38:14,209 --> 01:38:15,916
Yes! - Who?

1161
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:17,624
The person whom l hit.

1162
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,249
lt was his grandfather who expired.

1163
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:22,124
What is he saying?
- Has beeran gone mad?

1164
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:24,749
Who is he talking about?
- l don"t understand.

1165
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,291
Look! That much has
been cut in just two days.

1166
01:38:39,584 --> 01:38:43,374
That"s a big area.
This will soon reach 7000 Kandi.

1167
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:44,708
Did you see there?

1168
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:45,583
Where?
- There.

1169
01:38:46,792 --> 01:38:50,083
Look! They are the
Famous Mangalore brothers.

1170
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,083
Now! There are so many out there.

1171
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:54,416
They have chopped
and destroyed everything.

1172
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:58,708
They are continuing cutting. Aren"t they?
- Yes! Yes.

1173
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,791
They will destroy everything in,
no time.

1174
01:39:01,167 --> 01:39:03,458
lt is sad to know
that they are going..

1175
01:39:03,667 --> 01:39:06,583
..to make paper napkins
and toilet papers with these woods.

1176
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:12,124
See! - Give it.

1177
01:39:36,292 --> 01:39:40,708
Gone ! Everyone will die,
7000 Kandi will be destroyed.

1178
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:42,041
Goodness! Gone! Gone!

1179
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:45,083
Don"t be afraid. Don"t be afraid.
Wait, wait.- Come. come.

1180
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,791
Sister! Sister! Everything
is gone sister. Everything is gone.

1181
01:40:03,542 --> 01:40:05,374
You will have to save us.
- What?

1182
01:40:08,167 --> 01:40:09,624
You will have to save us.

1183
01:40:10,792 --> 01:40:11,624
No!

1184
01:40:15,334 --> 01:40:17,083
First, step down.

1185
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,291
You will have to save us.

1186
01:40:41,334 --> 01:40:43,749
Sit! Be seated.

1187
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,291
We will save you,
but you will have to stand by us.

1188
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:53,083
Parangodan doesn"t
understand the seriousness.

1189
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:56,083
He plays and plays
and loses it every time.

1190
01:40:56,834 --> 01:40:59,249
Okay! What if we help him win?

1191
01:41:03,375 --> 01:41:05,958
Lift it! Taka!

1192
01:41:06,167 --> 01:41:08,124
Snake! We won.

1193
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,041
Wah! Wah!

1194
01:41:10,042 --> 01:41:11,499
Sir! Have a look.

1195
01:41:15,167 --> 01:41:16,624
Roll it once more.

1196
01:41:16,834 --> 01:41:18,208
Rolled, rolled now show.

1197
01:41:18,459 --> 01:41:20,749
Roll fast shall stop.

1198
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:22,916
This is cheating.

1199
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:24,791
Roll it.

1200
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,749
Shall we tell Glappan?

1201
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,291
l think it is the right time.

1202
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:32,374
Thhaka. Amble!

1203
01:41:37,167 --> 01:41:37,958
Let me see.

1204
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:39,999
Want to see.
- He will tell them, won"t he?

1205
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,583
Be careful.

1206
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,791
Let me see.

1207
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:55,583

1208
01:41:55,959 --> 01:41:56,999
Hey!

1209
01:41:58,334 --> 01:41:58,916
No, need.

1210
01:41:59,292 --> 01:42:00,291
What happened?

1211
01:42:01,834 --> 01:42:03,874
Sit! Roll once more.

1212
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:04,624
Needed?

1213
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,749
Meekannai!
- Sit down.

1214
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:15,208
Now start.

01:42:16,167 --> 01:42:17,249
You all run, run.

1216
01:42:20,375 --> 01:42:23,583

Roll, roll.

1220
01:42:47,084 --> 01:42:49,416
Star!
- Me, snake.

1221
01:42:49,584 --> 01:42:53,249
Snake?

1222
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:59,291
Kakapoyee, you lost, you lost.

1223
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:02,374
l have won, l have won.

1224
01:43:03,292 --> 01:43:04,583
l think We are on the right track.

1225
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,291
Now you shall roll.

1226
01:43:07,292 --> 01:43:08,916
Now you shall roll.
- They are there.

1227
01:43:11,459 --> 01:43:12,583
Minnkanni. Roll.

1228
01:43:13,667 --> 01:43:17,041
Kakapayee has lost.

1229
01:43:17,042 --> 01:43:17,916
See!

1230
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:23,374
Say the symbol and roll the dice.

1231
01:43:24,542 --> 01:43:25,249
Cheater!

1232
01:43:25,459 --> 01:43:26,083
Guards.

1233
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:28,291
Hey!
- Not me, not me.

1234
01:43:28,459 --> 01:43:29,458
Betrayer's son.

1235
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:31,416
Uncle! Those people out there.
We won because of them.

1236
01:43:32,667 --> 01:43:33,583
Who are they?

1237
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:35,874
He Has seen us.

1238
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:38,999
Mother! You cheaters.

1239
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:51,124
Forgive! Forgive!

1240
01:44:05,209 --> 01:44:14,291
We won, we won.

1241
01:44:14,584 --> 01:44:15,249
The Alert signal!

1242
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:24,041
Run.

1243
01:44:24,042 --> 01:44:25,374
Why are they running?

1244
01:44:25,542 --> 01:44:27,791
lt"s their distress signal

1245
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,374
They have sensed some danger!

1246
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:31,999
Come! Come! Come!

1247
01:44:32,167 --> 01:44:33,208
Hey! lt"s okay!

1248
01:44:34,209 --> 01:44:35,874
Come, come on.

1249
01:44:49,042 --> 01:44:50,374
They are frightened seeing something.

1250
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:52,374
Guys kneel down.
- What happened?

1251
01:44:55,292 --> 01:44:56,374
What happened?

1252
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:34,749
See!

1253
01:45:57,084 --> 01:45:59,083
lt"s the first time that
they have come this close.

1254
01:45:59,459 --> 01:46:02,916
Somehow only if some miracles
happen can 7000 Kandi be saved.

1255
01:46:03,334 --> 01:46:05,624
They have come to
cut down this forest.

1256
01:46:05,834 --> 01:46:10,708
Trees will go, hutments will go, and
this village too. Everything will go.

1257
01:46:14,292 --> 01:46:18,124
You tell us. We will do anything.
But save us please.

1258
01:46:19,084 --> 01:46:20,083
We will try.

1259
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:22,749
We will do whatever we can.

1260
01:46:27,375 --> 01:46:29,291
As they have reached here.

1261
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,624
Will have to talk to
the contractors once more.

1262
01:46:31,959 --> 01:46:34,291
l don"t think there will be any use.
But still..

1263
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,708
Philipose,
you go and try speaking once more

1264
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:40,083
lf it still doesn"t work,
we will give them an answer.

1265
01:46:40,292 --> 01:46:41,999
But that should be a surprise.

1266
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,083
l have a medicine for that.

1267
01:46:44,709 --> 01:46:46,083
l"m also game for it.

1268
01:46:46,292 --> 01:46:49,833
But, there is one thing.
No one should be seriously injured.

1269
01:46:49,834 --> 01:46:50,583
What is a way for that?

1270
01:46:50,875 --> 01:46:53,791
Didn"t you speak of that ghost
the other day? l will bring it.

1271
01:46:54,209 --> 01:46:56,499
But, Mangalore brothers
should not come back here.

1272
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:58,083
No human should be injured.

1273
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,749
Total calamity.
- Yes.

1274
01:47:00,459 --> 01:47:03,999
They will not come. l will see to it.
l know how to handle it.

1275
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,333
For that one should know
how this forest will help you.

1276
01:47:07,334 --> 01:47:10,416
For that we will go out in
team and will find out how and why.

1277
01:47:10,584 --> 01:47:13,416
l want to some soda
tonic with quinine.

1278
01:47:13,584 --> 01:47:14,999
ln this forest?
- Yes!

1279
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,249
l will send Vedan to town.
lt might take 4 days though.

1280
01:47:20,084 --> 01:47:22,416
Quinine

1281
01:47:23,667 --> 01:47:24,999
Kunine!
- Quinine

1282
01:47:26,167 --> 01:47:27,249
Quinine.

1283
01:47:28,167 --> 01:47:29,916
Kolan!
- Quinine.

1284
01:47:31,875 --> 01:47:35,208
lf it is so then l need some
potassium nitrate and sulphur.

1285
01:47:36,167 --> 01:47:38,833
l will prescribe it.
We will need it in more amounts.

1286
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:40,291
l too want more quinine.

1287
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,708
What if we frighten them?

1288
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,208
Fear!

1289
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:48,624
Fear! That"s the biggest shock
which can be ever given to an enemy.

1290
01:47:50,209 --> 01:47:52,916
Rest all is,
as the fate of 7000 Kandi.

1291
01:48:01,167 --> 01:48:02,791
Greeting Sir!
- Greetings.

1292
01:48:03,084 --> 01:48:04,083
Are you fine?

1293
01:48:04,334 --> 01:48:07,749
Why Guru? Have come
again to get under our skin?

1294
01:48:08,167 --> 01:48:09,249
Haven"t we told you.

1295
01:48:10,292 --> 01:48:12,999
Not to come here over and
over again saying the same thing?

1296
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:19,124
lt"s very important for us.
The forest.

1297
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:22,791
ln that Kodalibeda,
that is Tevar's forest.

1298
01:48:23,084 --> 01:48:25,749
lt"s precious nature. Don"t ruin it.

1299
01:48:26,084 --> 01:48:28,374
l"m saying it for your own good.

1300
01:48:29,084 --> 01:48:32,749
We have seen many forests.
What"s so great about this one?

1301
01:48:33,167 --> 01:48:34,583
Simply don"t try to frighten us.

1302
01:48:35,834 --> 01:48:37,624
lt"s not so simple.

1303
01:48:38,167 --> 01:48:39,374
150yrs back.

1304
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:41,999
This forest had scared off the
Prestigious Lord Livingstone company.

1305
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,208
During fearful dark moon lunar phases.

1306
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:47,791
Natural forces are
at their highest powers.

1307
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,416
So, only 3 days to
go be a little vigilant.

1308
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,291
l have told whatever l had to say.

1309
01:48:56,084 --> 01:48:59,124
The rest is up to you. May l leave?

1310
01:49:12,375 --> 01:49:13,749
ls he making porridge?

1311
01:49:14,834 --> 01:49:16,749
Not Porridge. Magic!

1312
01:49:32,834 --> 01:49:37,208
An elephant that
reproduced 2 weeks back.

1313
01:49:38,084 --> 01:49:40,791
You are too fond of animal
excreta and shit, right?

1314
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:43,291
These Buffalos..

1315
01:49:44,792 --> 01:49:47,749
Buffalo! Not wild
buffalo the domestic one.

1316
01:49:48,084 --> 01:49:49,374
There is no use off.

1317
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:52,458
Move away!

1318
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:35,291
Brave man, brave man.

1319
01:50:37,334 --> 01:50:39,083
Hurry!

1320
01:50:41,084 --> 01:50:43,999
What is the technique of it?

1321
01:50:45,334 --> 01:50:49,333
Bheeran, That"s the trick
of a soon-reproduced elephant"s dung.

1322
01:50:49,334 --> 01:50:49,916
ls it?

1323
01:50:56,584 --> 01:50:57,791
What are you doing brother?

1324
01:50:58,834 --> 01:51:00,583
Have powdered all the tuber crop.

1325
01:51:20,584 --> 01:51:23,416
lt"s as smelly as the
transport stand"s toilet.

1326
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:31,083
lt is the fresh shit of bats.

1327
01:51:33,084 --> 01:51:33,999
That all is there! Man.

1328
01:51:45,084 --> 01:51:46,083
Come let"s go.

1329
01:51:51,667 --> 01:51:52,791
What happened?

1330
01:52:01,875 --> 01:52:02,374
What is it?

1331
01:52:03,084 --> 01:52:04,374
Quinine on electric water.

1332
01:52:08,875 --> 01:52:10,208
What is this for?

1333
01:52:16,167 --> 01:52:18,749
What a foul smell.
Don"t you have any aversion for it?

1334
01:52:18,959 --> 01:52:21,999
That"s sulphur! Now we need
to add some potassium nitrate.

1335
01:52:24,084 --> 01:52:26,083
That is, bat"s shit.

1336
01:52:27,209 --> 01:52:28,999
Pity!
- Yes! Bats poop!

1337
01:52:30,667 --> 01:52:34,291
Have you all heard
of the war for bat"s poop.

1338
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:37,708
The battle of Angamos,
or the war of the Pacific.

1339
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,999
That war was held for bat"s poop

1340
01:52:41,167 --> 01:52:45,208
War? - Battle, yeah, now you
know the power of Bat"s shit.

1341
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:48,083
That"s okay, but,
what are you going to do with this?

1342
01:52:49,584 --> 01:52:50,916
That"s our surprise.

1343
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:52,416
Bhoom!

1344
01:52:52,584 --> 01:52:54,208
You"ve been saying
that for a long time

1345
01:52:55,709 --> 01:52:57,374
Come, come. Everyone come.

1346
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:04,749
Now the villagers will
transform into forest ghosts.

1347
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,874
Please turn of the light.

1348
01:53:10,709 --> 01:53:11,791
How is this?

1349
01:53:17,709 --> 01:53:18,208
Great job!

1350
01:53:18,209 --> 01:53:20,208
So this is the ghost.

1351
01:53:24,792 --> 01:53:25,499
Come.

1352
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,083
Sit! Sit.

1353
01:53:33,084 --> 01:53:33,999
Coming, coming.

1354
01:53:51,084 --> 01:53:53,708
You go in front,
l will come behind and you stay here.

1355
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:06,416
Here! Hold.

1356
01:55:06,667 --> 01:55:08,083
Pull it, pull it.
- Pull it, pull it.

1357
01:55:08,292 --> 01:55:10,958
Swami! Don"t roll over and fall down.
- You pull it man.

1358
01:55:22,167 --> 01:55:23,749
Pull it without making noise.

1359
01:55:29,667 --> 01:55:31,083
Tie it, tie it.

1360
01:56:02,209 --> 01:56:03,416
You see there.

1361
01:56:08,667 --> 01:56:10,083
Where has it fallen from?

1362
01:56:16,042 --> 01:56:17,749
Who did this?

1363
01:56:18,667 --> 01:56:19,708
Oh! God.

1364
01:56:28,084 --> 01:56:30,083
What is happened to our car?

1365
01:56:59,292 --> 01:57:01,416
Professor did you
see their trepidation.

1366
01:57:01,667 --> 01:57:03,208
They have got really panicked.

1367

Look!

1368
01:57:45,667 --> 01:57:46,749
Queen!

1369
01:58:30,584 --> 01:58:31,249
Peeko?

1370
01:58:32,167 --> 01:58:33,249
"Paccha maandeeni"!

1371
01:58:33,459 --> 01:58:35,208
Cat scratched or what?

1372
01:58:35,542 --> 01:58:40,749
No, " Paccha maandeeni "! Did you
understand? " Paccha maandeeni ". Did you?

1373
01:58:44,167 --> 01:58:46,749
God!

1374
01:58:47,834 --> 01:58:49,499
Hey! Look carefully man!

1375
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:51,999

What is it?
lt"s a raging bull. A raging bull.

1377
01:58:59,667 --> 01:59:03,249
You are an adventure guy you
must be having some kind of body art.

1378
01:59:08,792 --> 01:59:10,083
Oh! Bird.

1379

This was tattooed

1387
01:59:42,709 --> 01:59:45,916
And this is an aztec tattoo
it was done from Peru. - Nice.

1388
01:59:48,459 --> 01:59:50,291
And this is a Hawaiian friend"s.

1389
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,083
Looks like geometry!

1390
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,374
And.

1391
01:59:55,584 --> 01:59:58,374
Mayan from Mexico.

Bheraan! There is no chance

Save me.

1434
02:07:14,542 --> 02:07:19,874
Save me, save me.

1435
02:10:37,709 --> 02:10:40,749
7000 Kandi is not the
village it was earlier.

1436
02:10:41,875 --> 02:10:44,208
There is no Melamadhi
and Kelamadhi now.

1437
02:10:45,334 --> 02:10:49,416
All have become like Ponni,
full of love and unity.

1438
02:10:50,875 --> 02:10:55,499
As Menon sir wished no
one was injured in the war.

1439
02:10:56,334 --> 02:10:58,708
The magic you gave.

1440
02:10:58,959 --> 02:11:01,499
The evil spirits and
the courage you gave.

1441
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:03,583
And the weapons you created.

1442
02:11:03,834 --> 02:11:08,416
With all these there is no trace
of the Mangalore Brothers here now..

1443
02:11:09,542 --> 02:11:10,708
And then as you know.

1444
02:11:11,292 --> 02:11:13,916
Lease period is only for 4 months

1445
02:11:14,459 --> 02:11:17,624
After that this jungle will be
taken over by the lndian government.

1446
02:11:18,375 --> 02:11:19,958
This is not the problem now.

1447
02:11:20,584 --> 02:11:23,624
Have you heard of Vincci Rual?
construction co-operation.

1448
02:11:24,042 --> 02:11:27,249
lt"s one of world"s biggest
construction companies.

1449
02:11:27,709 --> 02:11:30,499
They have taken up the
place of Mangalore brothers.

1450
02:11:31,375 --> 02:11:33,083
They don"t require 4 months..

1451
02:11:33,292 --> 02:11:36,916
within 2 months they can
cut off the forest and destroy it.

1452
02:11:38,084 --> 02:11:41,874
lt"s not enough if Pargodan,
me and the villagers think of it.

1453
02:11:42,792 --> 02:11:46,749
lf you still have that same
Youthful will and boundless spirit.

1454
02:11:47,334 --> 02:11:48,416
Please come.

1455
02:11:49,084 --> 02:11:52,958
Malavedan, the villagers
and l are waiting for you.

1456
02:11:53,667 --> 02:11:55,208
Yours truly..

1457
02:11:55,667 --> 02:11:58,124
