1
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:52,218
Kitty! It's late,
time to hit the hay.

2
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,265
I just want to play
a little longer, mommy.

3
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:58,203
Come, let me sing you to sleep.

4
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:03,093
No, I don't want it,
I only want to hear it from Papa.

5
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:05,300
Mom, go back to your room, please.

6
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,301
Go to sleep, honey!

7
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:53,500
Easy peasy, fresh meat ready.

8
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,477
Mr. HÃ¡, did you hear something?

9
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:05,312
It's like something hit the train.

10
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,073
Follow me, we have
fresh meat ready to serve.

11
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,820
What do you mean by "fresh meat"?

12
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:16,478
It's the cattle from people around here,
they get lost...

13
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,870
and then hit by a train.

14
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,445
We call this... "BINGO".

15
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,999
How can we eat all that meat?

16
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,288
Don't worry.

17
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,162
Just make jerky out of them.

18
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,483
Don't you see
what am I carrying this bucket for?

19
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:31,330
Aren't we going a little too far?

20
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,350
Damn! That must be a strong hit.

21
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:39,812
See? It flew all the way here.

22
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,819
Pretty sure it's beef!

23
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,820
Look!

24
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,460
What's wrong?

25
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:59,359
Have you never seen bloody flesh before?

26
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,615
It's not that.

27
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:03,608
That meat looked so gross.

28
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:05,788
Come on, it's nothing.

29
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,444
Now what?

30
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:09,570
Can you keep going?

31
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,677
- Yes, I can.
- Okay.

32
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,874
Calm down,
what's the point of shaking like that?

33
00:05:19,484 --> 00:05:21,125
I'm not shaking.

34
00:05:23,804 --> 00:05:26,132
Looks like there's someone ahead of us.

35
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,054
How can he get there before us?

36
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,890
It's quite far from the neighborhood.

37
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:38,576
I don't like this feeling.

38
00:05:38,577 --> 00:05:41,546
'Cause you are a newbie.
You get used to it soon.

39
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:45,368
Dude, what you're looking for
in this dark?

40
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,687
Need some light?

41
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,640
Can't I just collect my flesh in peace?

42
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:06,403
The piece I'm looking for
is right in your bucket.

43
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,164
Give it back, please.

44
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,310
Help me, mommy!

45
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,180
Wait for me.

46
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,870
GHOST FATHER

47
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:33,409
My daughter's just only 4 years old.

48
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,389
But I am often away,

49
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,193
so I'm looking for a nanny
to look after her.

50
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:40,991
I'll offer you a reasonable check,
25$ per day.

51
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,561
No one pays you more than that.

52
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:48,428
But... you have to stay here.

53
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:52,662
How can you entrust
everything to me like that?

54
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,239
You haven't known me yet.

55
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,918
I trust the one introduced you,

56
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,429
also... I trust my instinct.

57
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:02,764
Now you can go home and prepare,
then come back here.

58
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,749
I'll introduce you to my daughter.

59
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:08,568
I think Kitty will love you so much.

60
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,429
Ok, I'll be back this evening.

61
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:16,732
So weird.

62
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,896
No idea when did
my phone screen break

63
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,529
It's terribly annoy texting like this...

64
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,819
By the way, I've got a new job

65
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,014
Can I come over to see you tonight?

66
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,328
Your rental this month alone is $100.

67
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:41,609
And $15 utility bills.

68
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,541
Good evening, Mrs. Landlady.

69
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,206
Well, aren't you a good husband today?

70
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,791
Just my daily duty.

71
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,666
Why are you collecting rent so late?

72
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:12,424
I'm not going to collect yours,
I went to Ms. Nhi's.

73
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,499
Really?

74
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,001
Geez! She hasn't
submitted her part for 2 months long.

75
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,322
So frustrated!

76
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:23,374
Have you seen Ms. Nhi lately?

77
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,826
I haven't seen her, like... about a week.

78
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:27,786
Her room is always dark.

79
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:31,501
When she returns this time,
I'll strip her rental.

80
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:33,667
Such familiarity breeds contempt!

81
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,841
Honey, sound like
someone is on the roof?

82
00:08:57,842 --> 00:09:00,953
Nonsense, maybe it's just a cat.

83
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,834
It's freaking freezing outside,
nobody's that crazy.

84
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,042
Who's that?

85
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,625
Well...

86
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,041
It's me, Van Nhi.

87
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,846
It's late...
Why didn't you call when you came?

88
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,749
I've come for a while...

89
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,979
But I only want to hear you play.

90
00:10:30,737 --> 00:10:32,244
Then what brought you here
looking for me?

91
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:34,290
It's... nothing.

92
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:57,616
This is the movie room,
use it as you wish.

93
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:58,617
Yes.

94
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:04,576
And this is your room.

95
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:08,957
For now, I've arranged for you to stay here
while taking care of this house.

96
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,709
Wow, you give me the whole room?

97
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,749
- Don't you like that?
- I love it!

98
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,708
It's way better than my rental room.

99
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,374
Your computer looks so nice.

100
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:23,873
This room used to be my private office
so it's quite fully equipped.

101
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:25,414
Oh, so many movies here.

102
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:27,784
Did you collect all?

103
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:30,833
Yes, it was my hobby.

104
00:11:30,834 --> 00:11:32,994
When my husband and I were living abroad.

105
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:39,131
Feel free to watch, if you like.
Just put them back when you're done.

106
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,251
Thank you very much.

107
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,713
Follow me.

108
00:11:48,714 --> 00:11:50,093
Yes.

109
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:03,583
This is my room,
and that is Kitty's room.

110
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,533
You let Kitty sleep alone?

111
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:06,283
Yes.

112
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:09,873
She was taught to sleep alone
in her room at an early age.

113
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:13,494
And the unlit room over there.
Whose is that?

114
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,867
My husband's room.

115
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,015
So...

116
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:24,985
Nhi... you should only know,
do not open that door no matter what,

117
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:29,744
and don't question either.
That's my request.

118
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:31,657
Okay, I know.

119
00:12:33,446 --> 00:12:38,454
Then, let's go see Kitty,
she's been waiting for you.

120
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,914
She's got a present to welcome you.

121
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,034
Kitty.

122
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:54,624
Kitty, nanny Nhi comes to see you.

123
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,874
I've got a phone call, come on in.

124
00:13:00,284 --> 00:13:02,373
Hello, Thanh's here...

125
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,584
Kitty.

126
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:05,914
Kitty.

127
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,954
Oh, you're playing hide and seek with me.

128
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,414
What's your secret gift?

129
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,287
It's so lovely.

130
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:19,744
I got you, Kitty.

131
00:13:29,534 --> 00:13:30,744
Where are you, Kitty?

132
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:33,624
Hello, miss Nhi.

133
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:37,783
Who did the No-Face makeup for you?

134
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:38,833
My mom.

135
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,743
- Did she?
- Yes.

136
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:42,453
You wanna go to bed?

137
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,454
- Do you like the "No-Face" ghost?
- I love it.

138
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,743
From tomorrow,
I will take you to school.

139
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:53,374
- And I'll play with you, okay?
- Okay.

140
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:06,703
Don't climb on the rooftop again,
It's too dangerous.

141
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:08,913
Who are you?

142
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:13,204
The one who cares about you.

143
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:42,916
Are you a thief or something?
Want me to carry you in?

144
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:47,685
Why are you always late?
You all look sleepy as hell.

145
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,686
Do I have to let you home
for more sleep?

146
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,249
What are you standing here for!

147
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,186
What a shame! Look at what time it is.

148
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,833
The final exam is almost tomorrow,
and you still behave like that.

149
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,537
Back to the book!

150
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:05,161
For someone to stand in the public,
language is one of the crucial elements

151
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,660
As it's always said,
speaking leads to answering.

152
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,114
Once you master languages...

153
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,485
Miss Nhi, let's buy some flowers here,
please.

154
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,572
What kind of flower?

155
00:15:20,573 --> 00:15:22,416
My papa loves these flowers.

156
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:24,424
- Ok, let's go.
- Yes.

157
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:25,542
Kitty goes inside.

158
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,538
Hello Kitty.

159
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,208
Hello Ms. Chinh.

160
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:35,288
Are you Kitty's new nanny?

161
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,208
Yes, how do you know?

162
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,863
Kitty's family is my regular customer.

163
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:41,708
Does Kitty like this flower?

164
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,699
She and her dad do.

165
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,060
They come here to buy
every afterschool.

166
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,288
It's Forget-me-not flowers.

167
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:49,867
Make me a bouquet.

168
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,954
One moment, please. I'll wrap it for you.

169
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,978
How much is it?

170
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:00,305
1$ only.

171
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,316
Give me, give me.

172
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,771
Here you are, Kitty.

173
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,947
These flowers will wither fast,
just come here and get some more.

174
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:08,916
Sure.

175
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:12,637
- Bye bye, Kitty.
- Bye.

176
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,117
See you.

177
00:16:19,577 --> 00:16:23,177
- Do you like arranging flowers?
- Yes, I do.

178
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:27,665
I'll make it a beautiful vase of flowers
for you, okay?

179
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,536
- No, not for me.
- Why?

180
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:33,635
Those flowers are for my papa.

181
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:38,517
âª Oh er yee yo... âª

182
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:43,442
âª The rough road I'll be by your side âª

183
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,933
âª You'll walk the school to be wise âª

184
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:51,197
âª I'll walk you safe through this life âª

185
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,010
Go to sleep, Kitty.

186
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:55,862
- Miss Nhi...
- What?

187
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:00,198
You sing too bad!!

188
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,957
Just sleep, dear.

189
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,453
Miss Nhi, please go back to your room.

190
00:17:08,454 --> 00:17:11,638
So papa may return and sing to me.

191
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:14,287
âª In the autumn wind, âª

192
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:18,156
âª I'll sing you to sleep âª

193
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,976
âª All the long night hours âª

194
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,410
âª I'll stay wide awake âª

195
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:30,119
âª Oh my sweet lady âª

196
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,989
âª Oh my sweet love âª

197
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,542
âª How I'm missing you now âª

198
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,840
âª My child, please don't cry âª

199
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:46,969
âª My child, sleep the night âª

200
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:51,647
âª Oh my precious child âª

201
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:56,633
âª Oh my precious child âª

202
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:59,967
âª Oh my precious child... âª

203
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:45,693
Teacher, it seems like
someone's stalking me.

204
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:52,786
Maybe you're busy now.

205
00:21:52,787 --> 00:22:00,617
I don't bother you anymore.

206
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,208
Do you believe
there are ghosts in this school?

207
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:08,248
I think there are ghosts here.

208
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,457
I have a strange feeling lately.

209
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:13,949
Are you serious? Don't scare us.

210
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,455
We fear ghosts so much.

211
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,653
Does it look like I'm kidding?

212
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,730
Then so be it.
No need to get agitated.

213
00:22:20,731 --> 00:22:23,503
Let's have some milk tea after school,
okay?

214
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:24,598
Okay.

215
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:33,694
Here you go, Kitty.

216
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:35,320
- See you next time.
- Thank you.

217
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:21,957
Who's that?

218
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:28,707
Who's there?

219
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,966
You have beautiful hair, Kitty.

220
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,029
Which one do you love more,
Dad or Mom?

221
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,325
I love dad.

222
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:00,790
Really?

223
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,832
Does he come back to lullaby you at night?

224
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,416
Yes, he does.

225
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:06,695
- Really?
- Yes.

226
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,548
Does he really comes
to sing you to sleep?

227
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:15,382
Once upon a time, there was a girl
called Little Red Riding Hood.

228
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:19,342
One day, she wandered into the forest...

229
00:24:19,343 --> 00:24:21,186
and bumped into a wolf.

230
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:25,273
What are you staring at, Kitty?

231
00:24:25,274 --> 00:24:27,749
Miss Nhi, there's someone in the tent.

232
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,208
There's no one there.

233
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,562
It's looking at me.

234
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,823
- Let me catch it for you.
- Okay.

235
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:40,791
Just stay here. I'll catch it.

236
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:57,329
Let me see...
Is there someone in here?

237
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:06,682
Who were you talking to on the bed?

238
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:59,967
âª My child, please don't cry âª

239
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:04,330
âª My child, sleep the night âª

240
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:08,698
âª Oh my precious child âª

241
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:12,490
âª Oh my precious child... âª

242
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,368
- Kitty.
- Yes?

243
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,833
Does Papa sing you to sleep every night?

244
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,140
Yes, he does.

245
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:33,415
So... which song is that?

246
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:36,344
- Autumn's Wind.
- Oh, "Autumn's Wind" lullaby.

247
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,368
So where is your papa,
I haven't met him?

248
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:40,957
He's got to work.

249
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:44,118
So... after lullabying you,
he go back to work immediately?

250
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,119
Yes.

251
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:57,708
I wanna ask you something...
but please don't laugh.

252
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:00,122
What's that serious matter?

253
00:27:00,123 --> 00:27:01,994
Have you got a Facebook account?

254
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,497
No, I haven't.

255
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:08,036
The social network can help you to
make friends from everywhere.

256
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:12,114
Even the school guard and janitor have.
Why don't you?

257
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:16,271
I'm too busy. And well...
I don't know how.

258
00:27:17,591 --> 00:27:20,563
So easy... let me do it for you, ok?

259
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:22,734
No, thanks...

260
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:24,494
I don't wanna become addicted,

261
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:28,024
and spend all my day
on the phone and social networks.

262
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:30,312
Okay, I got it.

263
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:33,249
Teacher, can you take a selfie with me?

264
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:34,843
- Selfie again?
- Yes.

265
00:27:40,735 --> 00:27:41,735
Say cheese!

266
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,390
Smile, please?

267
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:58,538
Have you seen your new picture yet?

268
00:27:58,539 --> 00:27:59,698
Looks... yummy!

269
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:07,784
It's occupied.

270
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,159
I said... occupied!

271
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:13,999
What the hell...!

272
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,248
Someone is stalking me...

273
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:32,039
It secretly took my pictures
while I was sleeping

274
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:37,444
Here... yummy noodles for you.

275
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:46,582
Let me feed you!

276
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,593
- I feed myself.
- Ok.

277
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:50,178
Kitty is such a good girl.

278
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,998
- Is it good?
- Yes, it is.

279
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:44,684
Where did you get these photos?

280
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:46,420
Who are you?

281
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,906
Why did you do this to me?

282
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:51,687
You will know who I am, soon.

283
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:33,077
I really hate that girl.

284
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:35,561
She thinks she's a superstar or something.

285
00:35:35,562 --> 00:35:37,411
What an arrogant bitch!

286
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:40,181
She just need a coat to
become a real coat-frock.

287
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:42,012
She's nothing special to my eyes.

288
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:45,224
If she's as rich as you,
maybe no one can stand her.

289
00:35:45,755 --> 00:35:47,575
Why do you guys hate her like that?

290
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:49,568
For no reason, we just like to.

291
00:35:58,787 --> 00:36:01,308
What are you staring at me for?

292
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,863
Never seen anyone
washing hands after having a dump?

293
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:08,692
Hello Kitty!

294
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:10,848
How old are you?

295
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,949
- Hello, hello.
- I'm four.

296
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,667
You are four years old?
What are you doing, pretty Kitty?

297
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:20,127
I'm making braids for Barbie.

298
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:21,213
Hm... so handy!

299
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:26,878
Let me give you a kiss!
Who is the prettiest girl here?

300
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:20,768
Go to sleep, honey.

301
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:03,434
Mommy's back, auntie Nhi!

302
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:04,895
Kitty... be careful!

303
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:10,185
Mom's home... Welcome home!

304
00:40:10,795 --> 00:40:13,353
My honey! Missed me yet?

305
00:40:13,354 --> 00:40:14,439
I miss you so much!

306
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,447
Good evening, Ms. Thanh.

307
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:18,806
These flowers are nice, right, mom?

308
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,064
Yes, nice.

309
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:21,837
Have you finished your work?

310
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:25,032
Not yet. But I have to be back home
as I promised you.

311
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:27,515
- Have you well behaved with her?
- Yes, I have.

312
00:40:29,419 --> 00:40:32,277
- Do you like auntie Nhi?
- Yes, I do.

313
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:33,575
Good! Come here!

314
00:40:36,294 --> 00:40:38,270
I'll sleep with you tonight, honey.

315
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,841
Have some fruit, Ms. Thanh.

316
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,231
There's something strange in the house.

317
00:40:51,145 --> 00:40:52,145
What's wrong?

318
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:55,145
I think there's a thief.

319
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,565
No thief dares to be around here.

320
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:05,105
No thief... so it must be a bandit?

321
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:08,269
This area's safe. Don't worry!

322
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:13,807
Now you're here. So I don't have to
stay here tonight, right?

323
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:15,698
I'll sleep with Kitty tonight.

324
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,605
But... just keep staying here.

325
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,979
And taking care of Kitty
a few more days.

326
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,065
Because I must be back to work tomorrow.

327
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:28,310
Okay.
But... you even work on Saturday?

328
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,548
And one more thing.

329
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:37,556
Lately, I heard someone singing
in the house.

330
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:40,536
Must have been Kitty's.

331
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:44,318
No... it was a man's voice.

332
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:51,256
Maybe...

333
00:41:52,765 --> 00:41:54,515
Maybe... that was Kitty's father?

334
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:09,497
We are in our own way.
How could that happen?

335
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,515
What do you mean?

336
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:15,903
That wasn't Kitty's father.

337
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:21,725
But... Kitty was so sure about that.

338
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:31,333
Kitty... Was Papa back home
and sing you to sleep?

339
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:34,560
No, he wasn't.

340
00:42:39,012 --> 00:42:40,364
Have some fruits.

341
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:55,161
Who's that?

342
00:43:56,848 --> 00:43:58,228
Is that you, Ms. Thanh?

343
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,801
You scared me.

344
00:44:03,802 --> 00:44:05,065
You made me think of...

345
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,895
What's wrong, Ms. Thanh?

346
00:44:18,713 --> 00:44:19,713
Ms. Thanh.

347
00:44:20,776 --> 00:44:23,260
I'm sorry for what I said
in the evening...

348
00:44:29,591 --> 00:44:31,015
Just get back to your room.

349
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:35,185
I wanna be alone.

350
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:08,814
Ms. Thanh...

351
00:45:08,815 --> 00:45:11,670
there's something strange
that I haven't told you.

352
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:14,217
What's wrong this time, tell me?

353
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:15,684
Since I moved in,

354
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:18,871
my phone's suddenly had a lot of
weird photos.

355
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:20,496
I'm sure that I didn't take those.

356
00:45:20,497 --> 00:45:23,059
Only Kitty and me at home.
So then who did this?

357
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,431
Look at these!

358
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:26,488
This,

359
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:27,489
this,

360
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:28,988
and this also.

361
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:32,099
Most of them are sexual photos of me.

362
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,692
See? This one too...

363
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,769
I think Kitty took them.

364
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,644
She loves to play on the phone.

365
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:46,199
In my phone, lots and lots
of photos of me that she took.

366
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,176
I don't think so...
She's too young to use the phone.

367
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:55,284
No, you're wrong...
She used it far better than me.

368
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,222
But...

369
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:59,878
What do you mean
by keeping saying that, Nhi?

370
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:01,597
Only three people in the house,

371
00:46:01,598 --> 00:46:04,863
I'm off to work all the time.
Just you with Kitty.

372
00:46:04,864 --> 00:46:06,285
Who else if it's not Kitty?

373
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:11,481
OK, let me show you.

374
00:46:12,185 --> 00:46:13,185
Kitty!

375
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:15,452
Come here!

376
00:46:16,213 --> 00:46:17,449
Come to mommy.

377
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,441
Can you take a picture
for Miss Nhi and me?

378
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:22,543
- Okay
- Okay, hold the phone.

379
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:24,635
We're sitting here!

380
00:46:28,925 --> 00:46:30,635
1... 2... 3!

381
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,807
That's good, honey!
Look at it!

382
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:37,236
See?

383
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:40,479
Feel better?

384
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:43,355
If there's something else,
text me.

385
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,588
You are going to learn about
the concept of "Rest" in music.

386
00:46:48,236 --> 00:46:50,837
Rest is the length
of a sound absence,

387
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:53,196
the interval of silence
in pieces of music.

388
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:56,869
A Rest is also a material
in composing musical structure.

389
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,423
The length of the pause
is indicated by the Rest symbols.

390
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:05,874
Go on and read.

391
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:10,302
In our school library, there are a lot
more good books for your reference.

392
00:47:14,554 --> 00:47:16,295
Such a mess!

393
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:17,843
You jerk...

394
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:07,355
Who's there?

395
00:48:28,565 --> 00:48:30,065
Who's that?

396
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,645
Is that you, Mr. Minh?

397
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:45,482
It's me.

398
00:48:48,646 --> 00:48:50,271
Where the others?

399
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:53,528
They've all gone!

400
00:48:54,623 --> 00:48:56,645
Come here!

401
00:49:02,225 --> 00:49:03,975
Why are you still here?

402
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:06,019
And you?

403
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:12,172
Fermata is also used
alongside with rests.

404
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:15,306
Half rest can be used
when silencing a whole beat length,

405
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:17,938
Seems like I am...

406
00:49:17,939 --> 00:49:19,899
making all of you
fall asleep on my lecture today?

407
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:22,021
No, I'm not...

408
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:25,691
Teacher, are you busy?
Why don't you reply?

409
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:31,419
Teacher, do you like popcorn?

410
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:33,431
No, thank you.

411
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,113
I wanna ask you something.

412
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:41,475
Please don't get mad at me.

413
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,857
Have you been married?

414
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:16,069
It's late... you should go home!

415
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:17,582
You have to travel a few days.

416
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:21,307
Could I move in
to take care of the house for you?

417
00:50:22,873 --> 00:50:23,943
It's impossible, Nhi.

418
00:50:25,584 --> 00:50:28,514
Because this is my friend's house,
not mine.

419
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:33,498
When I finish my work,
I'll leave this town right away.

420
00:50:35,904 --> 00:50:37,541
Please understand that.

421
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:40,667
So you will quit teaching at university?

422
00:50:42,528 --> 00:50:43,528
I think so.

423
00:50:44,982 --> 00:50:45,982
Nhi...

424
00:50:46,897 --> 00:50:51,123
From now on, please don't ever
ask about my family.

425
00:50:52,576 --> 00:50:56,654
That's a very sad story.
I don't want to mention.

426
00:50:58,477 --> 00:50:59,806
Understand for me, please!

427
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,841
âª In the autumn wind, âª

428
00:51:03,842 --> 00:51:06,331
âª I'll sing you to sleep âª

429
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:08,396
âª All the long night hours âª

430
00:51:08,397 --> 00:51:10,662
âª I'll stay wide awake âª

431
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:12,699
âª Oh my sweet lady âª

432
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,763
âª How I'm missing you now âª

433
00:51:14,764 --> 00:51:15,764
Oops...

434
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:37,689
Let me check it.

435
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:41,054
Are you hurt?

436
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:52,332
Miss Nhi...

437
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,117
- What's wrong?
- The Boogeyman's in the closet.

438
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:56,383
What Boogeyman?

439
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:58,821
His hand scared me from that closet.

440
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:03,032
Be careful when you open,
of he'll take you.

441
00:53:03,868 --> 00:53:05,345
Where's the Boogeyman?

442
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:07,731
I just saw his hand.

443
00:53:07,732 --> 00:53:09,272
There's nothing there.

444
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:12,476
I did see his hand clearly.

445
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:15,424
Now you get back to your dolls...
I have work to do.

446
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,425
Okay.

447
00:53:57,757 --> 00:53:59,021
Kitty!

448
00:53:59,022 --> 00:54:02,066
Why aren't you in your room sleeping?
What are you here for?

449
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:05,319
The Boogeyman's upstairs.
I'm scared...

450
00:54:06,108 --> 00:54:09,215
There is no Boogeyman.
Let me bring you back to bed.

451
00:54:09,216 --> 00:54:10,876
No, I don't want to.

452
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,203
- Stay with me then, ok?
- Ok.

453
00:56:34,147 --> 00:56:37,356
Can you go home tonight, Ms. Thanh?

454
00:56:37,357 --> 00:56:40,357
I need to tell you something.

455
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:03,169
Miss Nhi, you've got a phone call.

456
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:06,957
Someone's calling, miss Nhi.

457
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,158
Ok, I heard that.

458
00:57:14,117 --> 00:57:18,396
What's so urgent?
Something happened with Kitty?

459
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:22,056
Kitty is ok.

460
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:24,937
Kitty's fine, then I have no worry.

461
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:34,307
But I don't feel well.

462
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:48,246
Kitty!

463
00:57:48,247 --> 00:57:51,994
It's late, I'll get you some milk
then we head to bed, okay?

464
00:57:51,995 --> 00:57:54,305
- Okay
- Good girl!

465
00:58:16,857 --> 00:58:18,232
Miss Nhi...

466
00:58:32,037 --> 00:58:33,629
Miss Nhi...

467
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,464
Kitty, I'm preparing your milk.
No need to come over here.

468
00:58:36,465 --> 00:58:39,380
Miss, there's a boogeyman upstairs.

469
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:44,357
What boogeyman again?
Go upstairs to your bed now.

470
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:44,219
Miss Nhi...
Can I sleep with you?

471
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:45,584
Come on in.

472
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:08,340
âª In the autumn wind, âª

473
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:12,254
âª I'll sing you to sleep âª

474
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:15,649
âª All the long night hours âª

475
01:02:16,434 --> 01:02:19,908
âª I'll stay wide awake âª

476
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:24,218
âª Oh my sweet lady âª

477
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:27,420
âª Oh my sweet love âª

478
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:32,431
âª How I'm missing you now âª

479
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:37,275
âª My child, please don't cry âª

480
01:02:37,276 --> 01:02:41,446
âª My child, sleep the night âª

481
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:45,719
âª Oh my precious child âª

482
01:02:46,257 --> 01:02:49,414
âª Oh my precious child âª

483
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,529
âª Oh my precious child... âª

484
01:04:06,873 --> 01:04:10,547
Since you were away,

485
01:04:10,548 --> 01:04:12,856
I've been seeing you in my dream.

486
01:04:12,857 --> 01:04:15,406
But it's strange that...

487
01:04:15,407 --> 01:04:17,856
in my dreams, you were a ghost.

488
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:19,857
Lol, what if...?

489
01:04:36,942 --> 01:04:39,098
Ms. Thanh,
you think who took these photos?

490
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:56,439
I really feel worried and afraid now.

491
01:04:57,047 --> 01:04:58,047
What are you afraid of?

492
01:05:00,281 --> 01:05:01,851
I think...

493
01:05:01,852 --> 01:05:04,641
The most fearful creature
in the world is human.

494
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:10,227
All other fears are just imagination.

495
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,107
No.

496
01:05:12,895 --> 01:05:16,208
The most frightening things are
those that we don't know.

497
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,708
Are you hiding something from me?

498
01:05:23,661 --> 01:05:25,153
What should I be hiding?

499
01:05:26,435 --> 01:05:30,013
Like... the secret room that
you don't allow me to step in.

500
01:05:30,849 --> 01:05:32,856
When I was cleaning the house
a few days ago,

501
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:35,341
I saw a branch of "Forget Me Not"
in front of that door.

502
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:41,065
I think the mysteries in the house
all came from that secret room.

503
01:05:48,396 --> 01:05:53,765
If you keep on silent like this,
I can't stay here any longer.

504
01:05:54,511 --> 01:05:55,511
I'm sorry.

505
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:56,671
Nhi.

506
01:05:56,672 --> 01:05:59,395
Where are you going, miss Nhi?
Are you leaving me?

507
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:01,265
Miss Nhi...

508
01:06:04,185 --> 01:06:05,185
Kitty!

509
01:06:18,315 --> 01:06:19,916
So you're still determined to leave?

510
01:06:20,987 --> 01:06:21,987
Yes.

511
01:06:22,447 --> 01:06:25,786
Because since I came here,
weird things keep happening...

512
01:06:25,787 --> 01:06:27,779
that I can not explain.

513
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,700
I hope that you understand.

514
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:35,885
Kitty will really miss you.

515
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:41,541
She's crying upstairs
wondering why you want to leave

516
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,166
I know.

517
01:06:44,948 --> 01:06:48,299
Actually, during the couple of days here,
I have grown feelings for her.

518
01:06:49,304 --> 01:06:52,688
But... as long as I stay in this house,

519
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:55,335
I can only feel worry and fear.

520
01:06:55,936 --> 01:06:56,936
I am...

521
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:00,568
I got it.

522
01:07:06,138 --> 01:07:08,036
Your salary.

523
01:07:09,139 --> 01:07:13,145
Thank you for your time here,
helping me to take good care of Kitty.

524
01:07:16,871 --> 01:07:17,871
Thank you very much.

525
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:22,254
Perhaps I should leave
without saying goodbye to Kitty.

526
01:07:23,113 --> 01:07:24,355
Please forgive me.

527
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,808
Well...

528
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:29,477
Here's the coat that you lent me.

529
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,276
Thank you for your caring and attention.

530
01:07:32,277 --> 01:07:33,894
I should go.

531
01:07:33,895 --> 01:07:36,394
Please keep it as a gift.

532
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:38,935
Thank you, but I gotta go.

533
01:07:47,052 --> 01:07:50,435
Where are you going, miss Nhi?
Are you leaving me?

534
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:52,768
Miss Nhi...

535
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,528
Miss Nhi...

536
01:08:17,731 --> 01:08:20,988
Please don't leave me, I'll be sad.

537
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:23,628
Stay here with me, please.

538
01:08:31,293 --> 01:08:32,949
Miss Nhi...

539
01:08:35,894 --> 01:08:37,550
Miss Nhi...

540
01:09:06,165 --> 01:09:07,165
The heck...

541
01:09:33,059 --> 01:09:35,471
What's about her stuff?

542
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:40,118
Rest assure, I packed them all
nice and tight in the carton boxes.

543
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:42,629
How about we go down
and check for the last time?

544
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,698
- Sure.
- Please follow me.

545
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:48,583
It's dark down there,
let me walk you over to her room.

546
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:50,918
Here it is.

547
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:54,515
The door isn't locked, feel free.

548
01:09:56,015 --> 01:09:57,015
Thank you.

549
01:10:08,608 --> 01:10:10,522
There's a big box.

550
01:10:11,483 --> 01:10:13,928
I will have some worker
to move them all out tomorrow.

551
01:10:13,929 --> 01:10:15,193
Is that OK?

552
01:10:15,194 --> 01:10:17,624
- Ok, no problem.
- Okay.

553
01:10:18,288 --> 01:10:21,814
One more thing. How much
did she owe you for her rental?

554
01:10:21,815 --> 01:10:22,815
Two months.

555
01:10:23,366 --> 01:10:25,729
Oh, no no...
You want to pay the rental?

556
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:26,701
Please teacher...

557
01:10:26,702 --> 01:10:28,099
I'll tell you what.

558
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,041
I'm also feeling sad about
what happened to her.

559
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:33,421
How can I charge a person
that passed away?

560
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,874
So you don't know what happened?

561
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:41,264
I totally don't know,
I've just come back.

562
01:10:41,265 --> 01:10:42,938
Van Nhi's passed away.

563
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,688
It's been a week.

564
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:46,188
How did that happen?

565
01:10:46,189 --> 01:10:49,108
Someone found her body near the railway.

566
01:10:49,109 --> 01:10:50,874
She was hit by a train.

567
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:53,809
Poor her. There's still no one come
to bring her home.

568
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,652
Poor thing...

569
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:58,479
Do you know where she lived?

570
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,519
- She knows.
- Yes, I know.

571
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,266
Just go to the uphill street Dao Duy Tu,

572
01:11:02,267 --> 01:11:05,090
and ask for madame Tam Hoang's lodgings.

573
01:11:06,661 --> 01:11:08,246
Please accept this money,

574
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:11,942
consider me as her family
paying the bill on her behalf.

575
01:11:12,557 --> 01:11:15,113
It's your business anyway...

576
01:11:15,114 --> 01:11:19,110
You should keep the money,
so she says rest in peace.

577
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:21,106
I can't do that.

578
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:22,812
Since she pass away,

579
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:26,079
My heart was so broken,
I can't focus my mind.

580
01:11:26,587 --> 01:11:28,587
'Cause I used to
think bad about her.

581
01:11:29,148 --> 01:11:30,891
I feel very regretful now.

582
01:11:31,422 --> 01:11:33,488
So... how about this?

583
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:35,402
You keep this money...

584
01:11:35,403 --> 01:11:39,465
and buy some votive papers, candles,
fruits...

585
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:43,380
Help me to make an offering for her.

586
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:47,154
- Yes, I think it would be better.
- Thank you.

587
01:11:48,647 --> 01:11:53,122
What a pity! Passing away at such an age.

588
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:56,638
It surprised me also.
I had just met her a week ago.

589
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:59,271
I heard she didn't have any relatives.

590
01:11:59,272 --> 01:12:01,545
I can only count on you
to take good care of her.

591
01:12:02,099 --> 01:12:03,420
Don't worry, I'll do it.

592
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:08,897
- It's late, I'll see you.
- Thank you, goodnight.

593
01:12:19,842 --> 01:12:21,357
Teacher...!

594
01:13:11,781 --> 01:13:14,070
Do you believe
there are ghosts in this school?

595
01:13:14,953 --> 01:13:16,476
I think there are ghosts here.

596
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:18,914
I've been feeling strange lately.

597
01:13:28,426 --> 01:13:29,840
- Okay?
- Okay.

598
01:13:38,812 --> 01:13:40,023
Is someone in there?

599
01:13:40,766 --> 01:13:41,857
Just us only...

600
01:14:01,647 --> 01:14:04,037
What are you staring at me for?

601
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:06,679
Never seen anyone
washing hands after having a dump?

602
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:12,875
There are really ghosts in here!

603
01:14:24,225 --> 01:14:26,030
What brought you here
looking for me?

604
01:14:26,031 --> 01:14:27,012
A WEEK BEFORE...

605
01:14:27,013 --> 01:14:31,083
It's... nothing,
I just want to say goodbye.

606
01:14:31,084 --> 01:14:32,352
Goodbye?

607
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,312
Where are you going...?

608
01:14:35,115 --> 01:14:36,115
Van Nhi!

609
01:14:39,153 --> 01:14:40,153
Van Nhi!

610
01:14:41,349 --> 01:14:42,349
Van Nhi!

611
01:15:20,186 --> 01:15:22,838
Please don't leave me, I'll be sad.

612
01:15:23,662 --> 01:15:25,811
Stay here with me, please.

613
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:04,688
Kitty. Ms. Thanh.

614
01:16:09,869 --> 01:16:12,063
Kitty. Ms. Thanh!

615
01:16:16,744 --> 01:16:17,744
Kitty...

616
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:52,981
Today is the last day

617
01:16:53,606 --> 01:16:57,307
for our family to stay in this house.

618
01:17:02,582 --> 01:17:04,102
After tomorrow,

619
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:08,457
all of this will soon become memories.

620
01:17:10,605 --> 01:17:14,387
In the next few days,
it will belong to someone else.

621
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:23,128
To our family, sunny days, happiness...

622
01:17:24,128 --> 01:17:25,765
seems like none,

623
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:30,339
But full of memories...

624
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,391
of pain and loss.

625
01:17:35,461 --> 01:17:38,394
Since the day you and Kitty...

626
01:17:39,065 --> 01:17:41,406
left me forever.

627
01:17:45,648 --> 01:17:47,934
In the next few days,

628
01:17:47,935 --> 01:17:50,227
I'll leave town for a while.

629
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:56,356
So I will bring you and Kitty...

630
01:17:56,357 --> 01:17:58,040
to another sacred place.

631
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:05,043
I hope you two will forgive me.

632
01:18:09,378 --> 01:18:11,651
Kitty,

633
01:18:11,652 --> 01:18:15,801
please forgive your Papa.

634
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,580
Tonight,

635
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,873
I will stay here
with you and Kitty.

636
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:30,466
In the autumn wind,

637
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:34,055
I'll sing you to sleep

638
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:38,491
All the long night hours

639
01:19:38,492 --> 01:19:41,853
I'll stay wide awake

640
01:19:42,434 --> 01:19:45,658
Oh my sweet lady

641
01:19:46,226 --> 01:19:49,430
Oh my sweet love

642
01:19:50,677 --> 01:19:54,320
How I'm missing you now

643
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:59,389
My child, please don't cry

644
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:03,714
My child, sleep the night

645
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:08,453
Oh my precious child

646
01:20:08,454 --> 01:20:11,464
Oh my precious child

647
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:15,816
Oh my precious child

648
01:20:17,878 --> 01:20:21,485
Oh my precious child...

649
01:20:59,298 --> 01:21:02,499
Who are you,
why keep following me?

650
01:21:04,267 --> 01:21:05,891
I'm Quang,

651
01:21:05,892 --> 01:21:08,220
but you don't need
to know that anyway.

652
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:11,371
I like you, so I follow you.

653
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:15,527
It just that we were once
belong to two different worlds.

654
01:21:16,923 --> 01:21:17,965
And now...!

655
01:21:22,321 --> 01:21:25,605
I don't know how,
and when I died?

656
01:21:26,527 --> 01:21:30,254
You've followed me since then,
you probably know, right?

657
01:21:31,315 --> 01:21:32,315
Sure.

658
01:21:34,683 --> 01:21:37,589
That was the when you went back
from Mr. Minh's place.

659
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:42,603
You were focusing on your phone
without noticing the train coming.

660
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:45,853
I had to pick up
every piece of your flesh.

661
01:21:46,852 --> 01:21:49,719
Those who suffer sudden death
usually don't believe that they're dead.

662
01:21:50,603 --> 01:21:52,273
I was once like that too.

663
01:21:53,938 --> 01:21:55,683
But... that's not important now,

664
01:21:57,571 --> 01:22:00,336
Only living people care about
how they die...

665
01:22:01,508 --> 01:22:03,500
but for the lost spirits like us...

666
01:22:04,477 --> 01:22:06,281
Being dead or alive is not a matter.

667
01:22:08,687 --> 01:22:11,258
And those contacting me
on the social network?

668
01:22:12,063 --> 01:22:13,933
They're all the same as us.

669
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,437
Only ghosts can see each other.

670
01:22:16,438 --> 01:22:17,397
Hi, beautiful ghost.

671
01:22:17,398 --> 01:22:18,942
Nice to see you in this world...

672
01:22:18,943 --> 01:22:21,307
Let send her a welcome clip.

673
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:25,099
Where's the bone-breaking freak?

674
01:22:25,604 --> 01:22:28,246
I know he's into you,

675
01:22:28,247 --> 01:22:30,110
Me too!

676
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,813
Now, come down here and join us.

677
01:22:33,814 --> 01:22:36,361
The social network in hell...
so much fun.

678
01:22:37,103 --> 01:22:41,048
Honey, took you long enough
to come down here.

679
01:22:41,643 --> 01:22:43,986
Pretty like you is a treasure here.

680
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:47,468
Even I can not make
the second-best in hell.

681
01:22:47,469 --> 01:22:49,272
You must be number one.

682
01:22:49,273 --> 01:22:50,433
Remember me?

683
01:22:50,973 --> 01:22:54,137
I sell "Forget Me Not" flowers
to you and Kitty every day.

684
01:22:55,223 --> 01:22:57,105
Nice to see you... in hell.

685
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,823
Why did Papa leave me, mom?

686
01:23:04,824 --> 01:23:07,864
Will Papa never lullaby me?

687
01:23:12,168 --> 01:23:13,643
'Cause he's so busy.

688
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:16,947
So for now...

689
01:23:16,948 --> 01:23:20,386
He will be away from us for a while.

690
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:22,561
No, I don't want it.

691
01:23:22,562 --> 01:23:27,852
First, miss Nhi left me,
and now Papa too.

692
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:33,526
When he's done,

693
01:23:33,527 --> 01:23:35,831
Papa will be back with us right away.

694
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:39,438
Miss Nhi doesn't leave you either.

695
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:43,563
Just a few minutes,
and I'll take you to her, okay?

696
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:46,183
Okay, mom.

697
01:23:51,211 --> 01:23:52,683
Good girl.

698
01:23:55,982 --> 01:23:57,496
And now Kitty...

699
01:23:57,497 --> 01:23:59,103
Say goodbye to Papa.

700
01:24:00,961 --> 01:24:02,433
Goodbye Papa.

701
01:24:04,086 --> 01:24:05,944
Remember when you are done working,

702
01:24:05,945 --> 01:24:09,618
please come back to me and mom.
