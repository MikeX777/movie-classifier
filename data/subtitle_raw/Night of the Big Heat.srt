1
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,655
(bird song)

2
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,646
(cuckoo)

3
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:46,251
(brakes squeal)

4
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:56,444
- Can I help you?
- I don't know.

5
00:05:56,655 --> 00:06:00,011
The radiator's boiling.
It's never done that before.

6
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:03,008
I had the water checked
on the mainland.

7
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:08,684
- You've got anti-freeze in?
- Yes, you're supposed to in winter.

8
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,613
That's what's causing
the overheating.

9
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:14,125
I've taken my anti-freeze out
during this hot spell.

10
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:25,093
This is the best I can do,
unless you want me to drain it off.

11
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:26,364
No, not now.

12
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:29,043
Tell me, is the Swan
far from here?

13
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,809
Take the next right.
You can't miss it.

14
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:34,210
In fact, I'm going there myself.

15
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:36,212
I'd offer to show you,

16
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,809
but I think you should let this
cool down.

17
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,332
Do I owe you anything?

18
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:47,413
No. That's all right.

19
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,848
(high pitched whirring)

20
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:59,174
(high pitched whirring)

21
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:10,968
(volume increases)

22
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,850
(whimpering)

23
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,653
(moaning)

24
00:09:00,615 --> 00:09:03,891
This is the BBC Home Service.
Here's the weather forecast.

25
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,133
Most districts will continue
to be extremely cold.

26
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:10,008
Temperatures will remain
below freezing point,

27
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,809
ranging from 24ยบ
in Northern areas

28
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:15,529
to 29 ยบ in the South.

29
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:20,572
However, there are exceptional
conditions on the Island of Fara.

30
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:25,690
Temperatures are said to be in
the region of 90 ยบ, and still rising.

31
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:28,655
90 degrees and still rising!

32
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,891
- Surely it can't get any hotter.
- Apparently, it can.

33
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:36,929
Yet on the mainland it's winter.
This weather doesn't make sense.

34
00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:40,844
Some rain wouldn't hurt.
At least it would cool the air.

35
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:42,010
Thank you, Frankie.

36
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:16,804
- Can I help you?
- Is Mr. Callum in?

37
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,167
I'm afraid not. He's on his
way back from the mainland.

38
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,572
- I'm Mrs. Callum.
- Angela Roberts, his new secretary.

39
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:28,373
Oh, yes. My husband said the agency
was sending someone this week.

40
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:30,930
I've a room ready for you.
I'll show you.

41
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,929
I'd rather like a drink first.
I'm gasping, this heat is stifling.

42
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:36,130
Yes, of course.

43
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,566
May I have the pleasure?
My name is Stone, Dr Stone.

44
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:42,733
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll have a lager and lime, please.

45
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,493
And so you shall.

46
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:50,769
Is this your first visit
to the island, Miss Roberts?

47
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:55,253
Yes. It's very pretty. I had a drive
round after I got off the boat.

48
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,133
It is hot, isn't it?

49
00:10:57,335 --> 00:11:00,213
We usually have the same weather
as the mainland.

50
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:02,975
I'm sorry, the ice melts
as soon as it's out of the fridge.

51
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:07,973
- Same again, Bob?
- No, just one for Tinker.

52
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,689
I must be on my way.
Just the one.

53
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,528
Oh, that's better.

54
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:18,643
If you don't mind, I'll finish this
upstairs. I'd like to freshen up.

55
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:21,244
- Of course.
- I'll show you the way.

56
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:43,049
- Is this all right for you?
- Yes, it's fine. Thanks.

57
00:11:43,655 --> 00:11:45,452
Let's have some air.

58
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:08,527
Oh, I see you're reading one
of my husband's books.

59
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:12,808
Yes. I thought I should.
Is his new novel interesting?

60
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:17,452
He never talks about his books until
they're finished, then he never stops.

61
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:22,093
- Have you worked with writers before?
- No. Mainly for publishers.

62
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:26,927
God, it's hot.
It's like being in the Tropics.

63
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:30,493
When my husband gets back,
I'll tell him you're here.

64
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:48,524
- Has Callum brought my parcel?
- He'll be back soon, Mr. Hanson.

65
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,090
Tell him to bring it
straight to my room.

66
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,365
- Well, he's not very polite, is he?
- No.

67
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:02,891
He's a strange character altogether.

68
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:05,245
- How long is he staying?
- Hasn't said.

69
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:08,253
We've been trying to puzzle out
what he does.

70
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,572
Every day he goes out with his camera
and masses of equipment.

71
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,925
He spends the rest of his time
locked in his room.

72
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,966
He won't even let us in to clean.

73
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,972
Good material
for one of Jeff's books.

74
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:34,211
(brakes squeal)

75
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,773
Bob, what the hell are you doing?

76
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:41,524
Sorry, Jeff.
I just wasn't thinking.

77
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,528
Thinking?
You're lucky to be breathing.

78
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,685
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

79
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:54,568
I thought I heard something.
I'm sure I heard something.

80
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:58,088
- Heard what?
- I don't know.

81
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,447
It was a sort of funny
whirring noise.

82
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,449
Must be going off my rocker.

83
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:08,888
- I assume you've come from the Swan?
- Maybe I did have one too many.

84
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:12,007
It's this blasted heat.
Sorry again, Jeff.

85
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,768
Forget it. No harm done.
But take it easy.

86
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:39,332
(high pitched whirring)

87
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:55,645
Hi, Ken.
Buying up the whole place?

88
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:59,814
We've got to keep cool.
The Met Station's like an oven.

89
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,494
They envy us on the mainland.

90
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,845
My publisher's threatening to pay me
a visit.

91
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:07,172
Tell him to bring some snow.
We could use it.

92
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,048
Haven't you experts figured out
what's causing this heat?

93
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:13,372
Or are we stuck with the villagers'
theory that it's the bomb?

94
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:17,568
The bomb? To be perfectly honest,
one theory's as good as another.

95
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,005
We haven't a clue.
See you later.

96
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:23,685
If the heat or the DTs
don't get you first!

97
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,565
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

98
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:48,690
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thanks. Good trip?

99
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:51,534
Yes, apart from nearly knocking
down Bob Hayward.

100
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:55,205
He was in the middle of the road.
How I missed him, I don't know.

101
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,293
Strange. He was all right
when he left here, wasn't he?

102
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:00,611
- Is that Mr. Hanson's parcel?
- Yes. Why?

103
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,567
He's been asking about it.

104
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:05,050
He ordered it be taken to his room,
immediately.

105
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,930
Did he? Must be important.
I'll take it up straight away.

106
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:27,649
- Yes, who is it?
- Your parcel, Mr. Hanson.

107
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:32,652
Come on, give it to me!

108
00:16:44,695 --> 00:16:48,051
I forgot to tell you.
Your new secretary has arrived.

109
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:51,804
- She's quite the modern miss.
- Really? Where is she now?

110
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:54,575
At the cove.
She went for a swim.

111
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,448
I'll give you a lift.

112
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:59,453
Fine.
I won't be long, darling.

113
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:14,006
(gulls squawking)

114
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:27,487
- I'll be off then, Jeff.
- Yeah.

115
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,889
- Hello, Jeff.
- What the hell are you doing here?

116
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:03,849
- You know why I'm here.
- Then you made a mistake.

117
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:07,765
I hope you haven't unpacked.
You're not staying.

118
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:09,852
Come for a swim.
It's fabulous.

119
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,011
Did you hear?
You're leaving.

120
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:16,174
Don't shout at me.
You always did go on. Cool down.

121
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,694
Now listen to me,

122
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:21,205
I'm not going through your special
brand of madness again.

123
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:22,848
Aren't you?

124
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,048
For 3 months, I wrote nothing.
I nearly wrecked my marriage.

125
00:18:27,255 --> 00:18:28,893
I'm not going through it again.

126
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:32,212
You can't just have a girl
and then walk away.

127
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,252
Don't pull that on me.

128
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,049
You were no untouched virgin
when we met.

129
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:43,054
How long was it before we tumbled
into your bed? Two hours?

130
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:47,774
- You needn't wait so long this time.
- You haven't taken in a word.

131
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:51,009
- You're clearing out.
- Just like that?

132
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,044
Just like that.

133
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:58,330
What are you going
to tell your wife?

134
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,008
That's my problem.

135
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,849
That you didn't like the look of me?

136
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:08,048
As far as she's concerned,
I'm just your new secretary.

137
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,973
You never did tell her about us,
did you?

138
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:15,735
(high pitched whirring)

139
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,653
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

140
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,612
Sounds as if it came
from beyond the point.

141
00:19:23,815 --> 00:19:25,851
(volume increases)

142
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:27,329
It's weird.

143
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:29,614
Strange.

144
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:34,013
Bob said he heard a peculiar noise
when I nearly ran him over.

145
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:39,610
(whirring fades out)

146
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:43,968
(gulls squawking)

147
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,728
Jeff.

148
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:16,688
Get dressed.

149
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:43,052
What happened?

150
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,334
I found him wandering on the road
by his meadow, in a fair old state.

151
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:50,288
He keeps on about
his sheep being dead.

152
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,333
What's the matter, Ben?

153
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:55,971
It's my sheep.
They all be dead.

154
00:20:56,175 --> 00:20:58,689
(crying)
Someone's killed my sheep.

155
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:01,887
- Can he lie down somewhere?
- There's a couch in my study.

156
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,972
HANSON: How were they killed?
- Come on, Ben.

157
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:08,004
- I said how were they killed?
- He's in no state to answer questions.

158
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:11,605
I asked a straightforward question.
There's no harm in that.

159
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:13,612
- You found the old man?
- Yes.

160
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,487
- Did you see the sheep?
- No.

161
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:18,687
Only Ben wandering about,
half out of his mind.

162
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:23,167
- Who's he?
- He's a guest. His name's Hanson.

163
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:26,128
Why is he so interested
in the sheep? What is he?

164
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:30,044
I don't know. He spends his time
locked in his room.

165
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,650
I'd like him to rest
for a while.

166
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:25,608
- Give time for the sedative to work.
- Of course.

167
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:29,125
What do you think happened?
Do you think his sheep are all dead?

168
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:33,533
Who can tell? With this heat it's
difficult to know what's going on.

169
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:38,684
Give Mrs. Siddle a ring, will you?
Tell her I'll be bringing Ben home.

170
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,764
Mr. Hanson...

171
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:52,125
Why is he so interested
in how those sheep died?

172
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:54,974
- Why don't you ask him?
- How's Ben?

173
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,530
- He's calmed down.
- Did he say what happened?

174
00:22:57,735 --> 00:23:01,011
No. Mumbled they were dead.
Nothing coherent.

175
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:06,485
The Doctor's not sure if it's
just the heat affecting him.

176
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:12,173
Mrs. Siddle? Jeff Callum.
Ben's with us.

177
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:16,254
He's not feeling well.
Dr Stone will bring him home.

178
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:19,811
He thinks there's something
wrong with the sheep.

179
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:24,891
(phone crackling) What's that?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

180
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:28,006
Don't worry.
He'll be home soon!

181
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:31,568
(phone crackling)

182
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:43,210
If the crisis is over,
I'd better start work.

183
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,935
Where's the typewriter
and manuscript?

184
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,534
Mr. Callum?

185
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:54,005
- Jeff.
- You can't start.

186
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:58,368
It's in the study
where Ben's resting.

187
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:01,574
In that case, I'll go and change.

188
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:21,930
(knock on door)

189
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,933
- Yes?
- It's me. Can I come in?

190
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:26,933
Yes, come in.

191
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,924
Forget it.
I didn't come for that.

192
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:47,165
You're here now,
but let's get one thing straight...

193
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,366
(water running)
Can you hear me?

194
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:52,487
Every word, darling.

195
00:24:52,695 --> 00:24:56,051
If Frankie finds out about us,
I'll break your neck.

196
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:57,370
(knock on door)

197
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:00,573
Miss Roberts.

198
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:10,009
It's only me, Miss Roberts.
I've brought you some fresh towels.

199
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:11,694
I'll put them on your bed.

200
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:22,012
Would you mind handing me one,
please?

201
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:25,214
Thanks.

202
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:33,726
(Door closes)

203
00:25:33,935 --> 00:25:35,687
I could kill you.

204
00:25:44,215 --> 00:25:46,775
(television crackling)

205
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:49,568
- Jeff.
- Yeah?

206
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:51,845
Something's wrong with the TV.

207
00:25:52,055 --> 00:25:54,364
The phone's been playing up, too.

208
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:56,810
It must be static
because of this heat.

209
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:01,530
I'll turn it off.

210
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:05,127
Bloody set.

211
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:07,731
What's the matter with you?

212
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:21,963
That's funny.
It's never done that before.

213
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:27,364
(high pitched whirring)

214
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,532
That noise again.

215
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:42,649
Stella, have you been
playing around with the telly?

216
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:46,086
Of course I haven't.
I never touch the thing.

217
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,411
(high pitched whirring)

218
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,574
Oh! What was that?

219
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:55,731
Don't come in,
there's glass everywhere.

220
00:26:55,935 --> 00:26:58,085
- What happened?
- Get a dustpan and brush.

221
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:00,286
- But...
- Get the dustpan.

222
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:03,692
You don't want the dog
getting cut, do you?

223
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:29,045
(phone crackling)

224
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:34,524
Jeff? Look, something's happened
and I...

225
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:37,568
What's that?

226
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:40,733
I can't shout,
I don't want Stella to hear.

227
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:43,369
But you remember that noise...

228
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:48,974
I said, remember that noise
I heard on the road?

229
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:52,447
I'll come over.

230
00:27:59,695 --> 00:28:03,290
Stella, I'm just going to go
down to the village.

231
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:06,214
I'll see if I can get
a replacement set.

232
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:07,973
What a story!

233
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:10,530
- What?
- You're off to Jeff Callum's.

234
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:13,249
You men and your horse racing.

235
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:16,728
We can't keep any secrets
from you women, can we?

236
00:28:16,935 --> 00:28:20,086
Hurry up.
You'll miss the next race.

237
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:47,970
Patch!

238
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:49,973
(barking)

239
00:28:56,215 --> 00:28:59,810
Patch, come back here!
Patch. Where...

240
00:29:02,695 --> 00:29:03,650
Oh!

241
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:21,214
Here, Patch, here.

242
00:29:21,855 --> 00:29:24,369
Who told you to come, boy?

243
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:27,763
You'd better stay, now you're here.

244
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:32,451
(high pitched whirring)

245
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:39,644
(barking)

246
00:29:52,655 --> 00:29:54,247
What's the matter, boy?

247
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:05,128
(volume increases)

248
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:19,047
No!

249
00:30:19,895 --> 00:30:21,965
(screaming) No!

250
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:29,051
(lntense high pitched whirring)

251
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:34,729
(screaming)

252
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:09,094
That's better.
This was a good idea of yours.

253
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:12,412
My fingertips were sticking
to the keys.

254
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:16,453
Some iced coffee will probably help.

255
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:24,526
Don't you get bored here
with the isolation?

256
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:25,963
Bored?

257
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:33,287
Yes, I suppose so, at times.
But then, who doesn't?

258
00:31:34,415 --> 00:31:39,250
It's the sort of thing you learn
to live with in a place like this.

259
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:46,724
What happened to Mr. Callum's
last secretary?

260
00:31:47,335 --> 00:31:50,452
Did she get lonely?
Is that why she left?

261
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:54,487
As a matter of fact,
she didn't leave.

262
00:31:55,695 --> 00:31:57,925
Jeff had to ask her to go.

263
00:31:59,415 --> 00:32:02,851
- He sacked her? Why?
- She took a fancy to him.

264
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:08,209
That made her a complication
and Jeff doesn't like complications.

265
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,089
I can understand.
He's very attractive.

266
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:15,492
She was wasting her time.
She didn't mean a thing to Jeff.

267
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:18,163
- Of course.
- I'd have known if she had.

268
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,924
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, I'm sure I would.

269
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,490
But if he were just having fun,
would you know?

270
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:28,654
(angrily) Jeff doesn't play around.
It'd be all or nothing!

271
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:34,254
It's a pity that such an attractive
man should shut himself away.

272
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,605
It makes you wonder
what he's running away from.

273
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:39,568
What do you mean?
What are you getting at?

274
00:32:40,095 --> 00:32:43,405
A man like that would need
a pretty good reason

275
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:46,129
for coming to live
in a place like this.

276
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:48,565
It's obvious he's running away
from something.

277
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:53,813
And it's obvious you don't know him
or you wouldn't talk such nonsense!

278
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:59,528
Oh, but I do.
I do.

279
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,447
I'm surprised Jeff hasn't told you
about me.

280
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:06,852
He asked for me personally,
didn't you know?

281
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:11,407
- Are you saying you knew him before?
- Knew him? That's an understatement.

282
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,287
You little bitch!
That's not true.

283
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:17,886
Don't kid yourself he's different.
Men are all the same.

284
00:33:18,095 --> 00:33:20,928
Within half an hour of me arriving,
Jeff was kissing me.

285
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:26,734
I don't believe you.
You're lying.

286
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:32,968
Yes, I am lying.

287
00:33:38,295 --> 00:33:41,731
Why?
Why should you lie to me?

288
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,690
I don't know.
I was angry.

289
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,843
It's an automatic reflex
when I'm being warned off.

290
00:33:49,415 --> 00:33:51,246
You were warning me off?

291
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:55,444
Yes.

292
00:33:57,455 --> 00:34:00,128
Yes, I suppose I was.

293
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:16,608
I thought I'd get a bit more written
before opening time.

294
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:21,286
I expected it to cool down
by evening, but it's getting hotter.

295
00:35:22,295 --> 00:35:25,207
- Bob never turned up, did he?
- No.

296
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,851
I thought he said he would,
just before the phone packed in.

297
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:30,647
What did he want?

298
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:34,212
He was on about
some noise he'd heard.

299
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:37,123
Like the one we heard
on the beach?

300
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:40,767
Jeff... You don't mind
if I call you Jeff?

301
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,891
- No, not at all.
- You said the noise

302
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:47,804
came from beyond the point.
Is that where the sheep were?

303
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,885
His farm is in that direction.

304
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:55,050
- Do you think there's a connection?
- Do you, Jeff?

305
00:35:56,735 --> 00:35:58,373
No, I don't.

306
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,254
I'm the one who's paid
to use my imagination.

307
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:05,971
The next chapter. I'd like it
finished tonight, if possible.

308
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:09,167
I'll take my coffee
and get the bar ready.

309
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:42,045
Jeff...
May I have a light?

310
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:01,891
Your hand's trembling.

311
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:11,730
I'm the same.
Feel it beating?

312
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:21,851
You know you want me.
Why try to deny it?

313
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:27,411
(high pitched whirring)

314
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:29,363
Quiet.

315
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:34,288
Listen.

316
00:37:34,575 --> 00:37:36,805
(noise fades)

317
00:37:38,415 --> 00:37:40,326
FRANKIE: Jeff! Jeff!

318
00:37:41,815 --> 00:37:44,648
Something just landed
over by the hill.

319
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:48,006
I was looking out of the window
and it landed in the field.

320
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:50,968
- What did it look like?
- I couldn't tell.

321
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:54,451
- There was glow coming from it.
- A glow?

322
00:37:54,655 --> 00:37:58,694
- Did it make a noise?
- That's what drew my attention to it.

323
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:01,773
A whirring, whining...
whining noise.

324
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:24,368
- It was from that direction?
- Yes, I think so.

325
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:44,414
Jeff!

326
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:53,607
- Let's get out of here. I'm scared.
- No. I want to find out who it is.

327
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:19,650
Hanson!
What was he doing up there?

328
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:21,208
Maybe he saw something land.

329
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:23,849
He wasn't coming
from that direction.

330
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:27,047
Surely if he saw something,
he'd still be there.

331
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:29,564
Maybe he wouldn't go over the hill.

332
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:32,209
Maybe it's something
even he's scared of.

333
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:35,134
He's crazy. Whatever he's doing,
he's obsessed by it.

334
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:36,404
Yes. She's right.

335
00:39:36,615 --> 00:39:39,129
If we stay out here,
we'll all have nightmares.

336
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,007
- Let's go back.
- Hold it!

337
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:45,129
You said you saw something.
That's why we came out here.

338
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:47,405
Did you or didn't you?

339
00:39:48,575 --> 00:39:51,373
Yes... I thought I did.

340
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:54,772
I thought I saw something
coming down.

341
00:39:54,975 --> 00:40:00,049
It seemed to appear over the top
of the hill and move slowly down.

342
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,007
But in this heat, I don't know.

343
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:04,410
Stay here.
I'm going to take a look.

344
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,412
Jeff, be careful.

345
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:11,449
It must've been the other side
of that high ground.

346
00:40:11,655 --> 00:40:14,965
Let's get out of here.
Wait till tomorrow, when it's light.

347
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:19,009
You can't leave us here
and I'm not going any further.

348
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,208
All right.
But I'll tell you one thing.

349
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:25,054
I've had enough of Hanson
creeping around.

350
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,847
I'm going to ask him
what he's up to.

351
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,645
(knocking on the door)

352
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,766
JEFF: Hanson, are you in there?

353
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:36,614
(knocking)
Hanson, do you hear me?

354
00:40:36,815 --> 00:40:38,373
I can't talk now.
Go away.

355
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:43,205
Open this door! Hanson,
open this door, or I'll kick it down!

356
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:46,050
No. Give me a moment.

357
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:50,689
What are you doing?
What's going on?

358
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:53,691
(knocking)

359
00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:55,089
Hanson!

360
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:56,649
Hanson!

361
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:01,450
The door!

362
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:04,005
Close the door, you idiot!

363
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:05,933
What do you think you're doing?

364
00:41:06,135 --> 00:41:08,854
Never mind about me.
What are you up to?

365
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:11,046
This is my hotel
not your bloody laboratory!

366
00:41:11,255 --> 00:41:13,325
I want some explanations, Hanson.
If that's your name.

367
00:41:13,535 --> 00:41:15,924
It is. And I don't owe you
any explanation.

368
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:20,253
You do if you're using my hotel
as a centre of your activities.

369
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:23,333
Were you out there to meet
whatever landed tonight?

370
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:26,447
- Landed?
- You were prowling around out there.

371
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:28,049
What's this about a landing?

372
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:30,246
I came to ask questions,
not answer them.

373
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:33,174
Yes, but this landing,
what was it?

374
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:37,051
I assure you I can explain,
but this is extremely important.

375
00:41:39,055 --> 00:41:42,172
Well, actually it was my wife
who saw it.

376
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:44,606
- Go on.
- She heard a whirring noise.

377
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:48,012
When she looked in its direction
she saw something glowing.

378
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:51,213
- Yes?
- And she thought she saw it land.

379
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:53,690
- Where?
- The other side of the hill.

380
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,447
Do you know what it was?

381
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:03,450
- Well?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

382
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:05,532
What was it, Hanson?

383
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:10,525
I don't expect you to believe this,
but for the past week

384
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:14,728
I've been convinced this island
is the centre of an invasion.

385
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:17,688
A landing point
for beings from another planet.

386
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:21,212
(laughing)
Beings from another planet!

387
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:24,885
Exactly. That's what has caused
this inexplicable heat.

388
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:29,054
I've heard some yarns from villagers,
but your theory is too much.

389
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,894
I'm not a superstitious villager.
I'm a scientist.

390
00:42:32,095 --> 00:42:35,087
I base my conclusions
on observations of fact.

391
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:37,855
What do you suppose
I'm doing here?

392
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,047
I've been collecting specimens.
Soil.

393
00:42:42,495 --> 00:42:45,771
Blood of a sheep.
I've been analysing them.

394
00:42:46,455 --> 00:42:50,846
You asked for an explanation, but
you're too dim-witted to accept it.

395
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:54,934
You've ruined everything
with your crass stupidity. Here...

396
00:42:55,135 --> 00:42:58,332
Perhaps I shouldn't
have broken in like that.

397
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:02,007
So you've been trying
to photograph these things?

398
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:06,288
I haven't been "trying",
I did photograph them.

399
00:43:06,495 --> 00:43:09,726
I used a normal lens at first,
but it was ineffective

400
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:13,530
against the intense light
that emanates from these beings.

401
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,735
Remember that parcel
you collected for me?

402
00:43:16,935 --> 00:43:21,087
It contained this.
An infra red filter.

403
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:24,293
I experimented with a special camera
and placed it...

404
00:43:24,495 --> 00:43:28,374
HANSON: Here. I used a mirror
reflector and rigged up the shutter

405
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:31,931
to be triggered by anything
crossing its line of vision.

406
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:35,684
- And something did come through?
- Yes, it did!

407
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:38,853
I was developing the picture
when you burst into the room.

408
00:43:39,055 --> 00:43:41,808
It would've given me the proof
I so desperately need.

409
00:43:42,015 --> 00:43:45,690
Then what you've told me so far
is pure conjecture?

410
00:43:52,015 --> 00:43:54,768
- Cinders?
- Incinerated by whatever was here.

411
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:58,365
The same happened to the sheep.
They were burned to death.

412
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:00,846
There's been
some sort of incineration,

413
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,570
but it doesn't have to be
a being from another planet.

414
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:07,575
I've analysed that, Callum.

415
00:44:07,775 --> 00:44:09,811
It was burned
by a high frequency heat,

416
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,210
more intense than anything
we can produce,

417
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,929
even under strict laboratory
conditions.

418
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:18,889
There's only one place
where that kind of heat exists.

419
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:22,207
Out there,
where the cosmic gases ferment

420
00:44:22,415 --> 00:44:26,044
and generate a heat greater
than anything we can imagine.

421
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,089
That's where those beings
must come from.

422
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:33,413
If you're right, how are
they getting here? Where are they?

423
00:44:33,895 --> 00:44:37,490
If we knew, we could destroy them
before it's too late.

424
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:42,485
Tell me, has anybody else
heard this whirring noise?

425
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:47,213
Yes, Bob did. In the lane,
over by the gravel pits.

426
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:49,372
Somewhere in this area.

427
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:52,244
(dog barking)

428
00:44:53,935 --> 00:44:55,209
(whistles)

429
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:03,968
(whistling)

430
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:07,888
JEFF: Here, boy.
What's the matter?

431
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:11,408
Callum!

432
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:24,889
Come on.

433
00:45:53,575 --> 00:45:54,974
I've found it.

434
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:57,164
Callum, look.

435
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:07,892
This doesn't affect you at all!

436
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:14,210
I appreciate how you feel.
I know he was a friend of yours,

437
00:46:14,415 --> 00:46:16,690
but that won't do any good now.
Look.

438
00:46:16,895 --> 00:46:19,614
Every particle of energy
has been sucked out of it.

439
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:24,809
Hanson... We've got to warn people.
They should be told.

440
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:28,609
No, not yet.

441
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:33,332
You forced your way in on me.
You had to know, didn't you?

442
00:46:33,535 --> 00:46:35,730
Now you're going to do
what I say.

443
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:39,325
The authorities have
dismissed me as a crank,

444
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,888
just like you did.

445
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:43,530
But I must have evidence,

446
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:46,687
and I would've got it if you hadn't
destroyed that photograph.

447
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:48,965
I need time to complete my tests.

448
00:46:49,295 --> 00:46:51,855
- How much time?
- Two or three hours.

449
00:46:52,135 --> 00:46:55,332
As for warning the villagers,
we must avoid injecting fear

450
00:46:55,535 --> 00:46:58,003
into an already dangerous situation.

451
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:05,448
Callum, have you noticed something?

452
00:47:07,175 --> 00:47:08,324
This heat,

453
00:47:09,975 --> 00:47:14,014
at this time of night
it should be getting cooler,

454
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:16,166
but it's building up.

455
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:26,048
- It's getting hotter, Frankie.
- I think you're right, it is.

456
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:28,928
- There you are.
- Thanks, my dear.

457
00:47:43,095 --> 00:47:45,973
Oh, what an atmosphere.

458
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:49,367
They've probably heard
about Ben Siddle.

459
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:01,731
I think I'd better finish
that typing, Mrs. Callum.

460
00:48:09,055 --> 00:48:12,684
No wonder the temperature's up.
Who's been hiding her?

461
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:16,134
Beer, Hanson?

462
00:48:18,055 --> 00:48:20,046
Frankie, pull me a lager.

463
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:24,089
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing.

464
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:27,412
- Jeff, I know you.
- There's nothing wrong!

465
00:48:29,255 --> 00:48:33,692
I'm sorry, it's this damned heat
that's making me jumpy.

466
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:37,767
We've been getting on
each other's nerves too.

467
00:48:37,975 --> 00:48:39,567
That's why I came here.

468
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:42,853
That shows how hot it is.

469
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:51,290
JEFF: Smash the bottles!
All of them!

470
00:48:58,655 --> 00:49:02,694
- I'll get the first aid kit.
- I'll get it. You'll never find it.

471
00:49:07,215 --> 00:49:09,410
What on earth's going on out there?

472
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:17,085
The heat exploded the bottles.

473
00:49:18,295 --> 00:49:20,445
It's unbearable, isn't it?

474
00:49:55,815 --> 00:49:58,170
- Here we are.
- Don't touch me.

475
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:00,691
I only want to put
a plaster on your arm.

476
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:03,204
- Let Ken do it.
- What's the matter?

477
00:50:03,415 --> 00:50:04,734
Let it go, Callum.

478
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,211
This heat is bound to lead
to irrational behaviour. I'll do it.

479
00:50:29,335 --> 00:50:32,327
(typewriter)

480
00:51:11,855 --> 00:51:13,732
(cries out)

481
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,847
I'll get Dr. Stone.

482
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:40,967
Come on, Tinker.
Back to the pub.

483
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:44,568
It's all right. Come on.
That's it.

484
00:53:00,295 --> 00:53:03,605
It was Tinker. He jumped me.
Come on.

485
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:49,335
(high pitched whirring)

486
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,815
(screams)

487
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:09,086
Callum, come here.

488
00:55:13,175 --> 00:55:17,134
Look at the gas cylinder. It's split
open, just like the car battery.

489
00:55:18,055 --> 00:55:23,527
Completely drained of every ounce
of energy.

490
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:28,934
Tinker? It's impossible. I can't
believe he'd do a thing like that.

491
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:34,046
Not under normal circumstances, but
these are not normal circumstances.

492
00:55:34,255 --> 00:55:38,453
If this heat goes on increasing,
it could drive us all insane.

493
00:55:38,655 --> 00:55:42,091
The body isn't equipped for such
pressure. The glands will fail.

494
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:46,607
Then, it's only a matter of time
before the brain is affected.

495
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:50,046
A logical conclusion,
but we should keep it to ourselves.

496
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:54,248
That's what Hanson keeps saying.
Two men have been killed.

497
00:55:54,455 --> 00:55:57,288
- Two?
- Who's been killed?

498
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:03,008
- How's the girl?
- She's all right.

499
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:05,012
Who's been killed?

500
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:09,611
Will someone tell me
what's going on?

501
00:56:11,295 --> 00:56:14,605
I'm afraid Tinker's met
with an accident.

502
00:56:14,895 --> 00:56:17,967
Jeff, who else is dead?
You mentioned two.

503
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,770
- Bob Hayward.
- Bob! How?

504
00:56:23,055 --> 00:56:24,374
It was an accident.

505
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:28,649
- Accident? He was...
- Callum, calm down.

506
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:34,246
These creatures are killing God knows
how many, and that's your answer?

507
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:37,373
Creatures?
What do you mean, creatures?

508
00:56:37,615 --> 00:56:41,051
- He shouldn't have told you.
- What do you know that I don't?

509
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:49,049
He claims we're being attacked
by creatures from another planet.

510
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:52,964
Claims? What do you mean?
You've seen them?

511
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:55,370
Bob Hayward and Tinker did.

512
00:56:55,815 --> 00:56:59,012
(sobbing) I don't understand.
I don't understand.

513
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,524
- Neither do I, Frankie.
- Here.

514
00:57:01,735 --> 00:57:04,886
His thinks the island is being used
as a test base for an invasion.

515
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:07,768
- Don't ask me why.
- It's quite obvious.

516
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:11,047
They have to discover if they
can survive in our atmosphere.

517
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:13,211
- That's incredible.
- Is it?

518
00:57:13,415 --> 00:57:16,930
We probe space searching
for information about other planets.

519
00:57:17,135 --> 00:57:20,684
It's logical that same thing
might happen in reverse.

520
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,331
Are you saying that Earth
has become a subject of a probe

521
00:57:24,535 --> 00:57:26,605
carried out by creatures
from another planet?

522
00:57:26,815 --> 00:57:27,964
Yes, I am.

523
00:57:28,175 --> 00:57:32,566
And what I saw land tonight
was one of those creatures?

524
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:34,004
HANSON: Yes.

525
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,685
One of them,
forming a spearhead

526
00:57:37,895 --> 00:57:40,932
to find out if life is possible
for them on Earth.

527
00:57:41,135 --> 00:57:42,966
And if it is possible?

528
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:46,445
Then, the main force will come.

529
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:50,167
Have you any idea
what they need to survive?

530
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,924
Heat. The way that car battery
and cylinder were split

531
00:57:54,135 --> 00:57:56,171
suggests they were seeking
heat energy.

532
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:59,367
- They obviously need it to exist.
- Fine, fine!

533
00:57:59,575 --> 00:58:03,454
We'll just wait for you
to complete your tests!

534
00:58:03,695 --> 00:58:08,246
The temperature has risen three
degrees in the last half hour. 108.

535
00:58:10,975 --> 00:58:13,443
At this rate, we'll all dead
by morning.

536
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:16,123
I accept that the situation
is serious.

537
00:58:16,335 --> 00:58:18,485
The indications are that
we're approaching a crisis.

538
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:22,483
- Hanson!
- Getting emotional won't help.

539
00:58:22,695 --> 00:58:25,004
- We must alert the mainland.
- How?

540
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,894
The telephone's out of action.

541
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:32,407
What about the Met station? They can
send a message. I'll drive up there.

542
00:58:32,615 --> 00:58:36,290
Just a moment, Doctor.
This could be very dangerous.

543
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:39,612
Someone must go.
We've lost enough time already.

544
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:42,932
Very well.
But don't go until I come back.

545
00:58:46,415 --> 00:58:50,806
- I'll come with you.
- There's no point both of us going.

546
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:53,210
You stay and look after the girls.

547
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:55,724
And Jeff, I should leave that alone.

548
00:58:55,935 --> 00:58:58,574
Too much of it doesn't help
in a crisis.

549
00:59:01,775 --> 00:59:03,970
This will help us
keep in touch.

550
00:59:04,175 --> 00:59:07,884
Aerial, press to speak,
release to receive. Got it?

551
00:59:08,095 --> 00:59:09,608
Yes. Thank you.

552
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:12,253
Good luck, Doctor.

553
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:17,525
- And be careful.
- Don't worry, I will.

554
00:59:21,135 --> 00:59:25,174
These creatures,
are they likely to attack us?

555
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,172
Depends what they're looking for.

556
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:31,163
I think they're looking for an energy
source to keep them alive.

557
00:59:31,375 --> 00:59:35,288
But once they've found it
they'll spread to the mainland.

558
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:37,370
Yes.

559
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,164
Hello, Hanson.

560
00:59:50,415 --> 00:59:52,133
Are you there, Hanson?

561
00:59:53,895 --> 00:59:57,729
Yes, Stone. I can hear you.
Where are you?

562
00:59:58,135 --> 01:00:02,333
I'm on the road to the point.
I've just passed White's Meadow.

563
01:00:04,015 --> 01:00:08,008
I can see the outline of the Met
station in the distance.

564
01:00:11,895 --> 01:00:15,570
The radiator's boiling up.
She's losing power.

565
01:00:16,055 --> 01:00:17,773
How far is the station?

566
01:00:19,735 --> 01:00:24,172
I'm not sure. About a mile
and a quarter I should say.

567
01:00:26,295 --> 01:00:27,614
She's slowing down.

568
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:32,088
She won't last long.
The heat's affecting the engine.

569
01:00:32,975 --> 01:00:34,852
It's very dark out here.

570
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:39,693
She's pulling badly.

571
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:46,730
The gravel pit's coming up.
I can make out the entrance.

572
01:00:55,255 --> 01:00:56,813
She's stopping.

573
01:01:04,135 --> 01:01:07,491
It's no good. I'll have to
leave her. I'll walk the rest.

574
01:01:19,855 --> 01:01:23,530
(high pitched whirring)

575
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:09,004
Hanson, I'm on the road.

576
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:12,931
There's a gap in the fence.

577
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:16,289
It looks like something...

578
01:02:16,655 --> 01:02:19,533
- It's that noise again.
- Get away from there!

579
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:21,373
Get away!
It's your only chance.

580
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:26,614
(shouting) I can't hear you!
It's this noise!

581
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:42,726
(screaming)

582
01:02:50,415 --> 01:02:53,009
Stone. Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

583
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:55,605
Get away from that sound.

584
01:03:01,455 --> 01:03:04,333
What's wrong?
Isn't it working?

585
01:03:06,295 --> 01:03:09,571
Yes, Mrs. Callum.
The set's working.

586
01:03:14,655 --> 01:03:16,407
It's horrible.

587
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:20,403
What now?

588
01:03:21,575 --> 01:03:24,009
- It depends.
- On what?

589
01:03:24,695 --> 01:03:29,485
Whether that meeting was an accident
or a deliberate interception.

590
01:03:29,855 --> 01:03:34,371
If it was deliberate, it means we're
not dealing with brute monsters,

591
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:36,884
but with a superior intelligence.

592
01:03:37,095 --> 01:03:38,574
Which do you think it is?

593
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:45,965
I don't know, Mrs Callum.
I honestly don't know.

594
01:03:48,015 --> 01:03:50,893
There must be an answer
to these things.

595
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:54,174
We've got to try again.
I'm going this time.

596
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:55,603
Wait, Callum.

597
01:03:56,775 --> 01:03:59,130
If you go out, you risk
sacrificing another life.

598
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:03,010
The Doctor took the risk.
We can't just leave him there.

599
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:04,364
No!

600
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:06,970
I'll have to go.

601
01:04:07,335 --> 01:04:09,246
HANSON: I'm not being heroic.

602
01:04:09,455 --> 01:04:10,934
Stone was taken by surprise

603
01:04:11,135 --> 01:04:13,444
I'm better equipped to deal
with this situation.

604
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,294
He's right, Jeff.

605
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:20,969
I'll take your Land Rover.
Have you got the keys?

606
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:25,725
Supposing they're still out there,
what will you do?

607
01:04:25,935 --> 01:04:30,850
If they are, I'll have to avoid
making the same mistakes as Stone.

608
01:04:32,055 --> 01:04:35,604
Keep these doors locked
and that set switched on.

609
01:04:42,735 --> 01:04:44,851
Lock the windows, Frankie.

610
01:04:48,095 --> 01:04:50,325
(sobbing)

611
01:04:58,975 --> 01:05:02,854
Angela. It's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

612
01:05:06,575 --> 01:05:08,725
I must've had a nightmare.

613
01:05:08,935 --> 01:05:12,405
I kept seeing that man
coming towards me.

614
01:05:12,615 --> 01:05:15,607
His hands...
I thought...

615
01:05:15,815 --> 01:05:19,649
It's all right, Angela.
It's all right. He's gone now.

616
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,807
There's no need to be afraid.
Come on. Lie down.

617
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:53,653
I shouldn't think we'll hear
from Hanson yet. It's too soon.

618
01:05:54,735 --> 01:05:57,693
You knew her before, didn't you?

619
01:05:58,095 --> 01:06:01,485
- Who?
- You know who I mean. That girl.

620
01:06:02,255 --> 01:06:05,884
- You knew her before she came here.
- No.

621
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:07,449
Don't lie to me, Jeff.

622
01:06:09,575 --> 01:06:11,054
I've said I didn't know her.

623
01:06:11,615 --> 01:06:13,924
I saw you kissing her
in the study.

624
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:17,087
That doesn't mean I knew her.

625
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:21,044
Ever since she came here,
you've been tense.

626
01:06:21,295 --> 01:06:23,525
Just as you were before we moved.

627
01:06:24,135 --> 01:06:25,329
Frankie, let it be.

628
01:06:25,775 --> 01:06:27,766
You did know her.

629
01:06:28,135 --> 01:06:30,968
All right, I knew her.
Leave it at that.

630
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:34,053
It wasn't difficulty with
your writing. It was her.

631
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:36,723
- That why we moved here.
- Drop it, Frankie.

632
01:06:36,935 --> 01:06:40,769
You're overwrought. The heat
is affecting us all. Let it go.

633
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:42,693
Are you in love with her?

634
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:48,049
Answer me.
Are you in love with her?

635
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:50,974
Not now, Frankie.
We're fighting for our lives!

636
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:53,894
It's important to me.
I must know.

637
01:06:55,455 --> 01:06:58,572
Tell me,
are you in love with her?

638
01:06:58,975 --> 01:06:59,930
No.

639
01:07:03,935 --> 01:07:09,134
- Then, what is it?
- I wanted her. I wanted her body!

640
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:16,373
Now you know.
She was a slut and I wanted her.

641
01:07:16,815 --> 01:07:18,965
But not any more.
I didn't ask her here.

642
01:07:20,935 --> 01:07:23,244
She's no more than a common slut.

643
01:07:23,455 --> 01:07:26,288
There's no comparison
with what I feel for you.

644
01:07:26,975 --> 01:07:31,526
That's why we moved here. It was
completely physical, I promise.

645
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:34,169
She never meant a thing to me.
She never will.

646
01:07:35,775 --> 01:07:36,844
(latch opening)

647
01:07:43,895 --> 01:07:47,046
Where is everybody?
Where's the doctor?

648
01:07:47,415 --> 01:07:49,326
He's not here.
Go back to the study.

649
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,094
Get him! I need him!

650
01:07:51,615 --> 01:07:53,446
He can't come.
Go back and lie down.

651
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:57,010
He should be here.
I'm ill.

652
01:07:57,215 --> 01:07:59,604
I need him.
Where the hell is he?

653
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:02,966
He can't come, you selfish bitch!
He's dead.

654
01:08:03,175 --> 01:08:05,131
(sobbing)

655
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:08,450
Dead? Dead...

656
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,890
Dead...

657
01:08:37,535 --> 01:08:39,412
(dog barking)

658
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:24,447
Callum. Callum.

659
01:09:24,935 --> 01:09:26,891
This is Hanson.
This is Hanson.

660
01:09:27,095 --> 01:09:28,289
He's found the other one.

661
01:09:28,495 --> 01:09:31,055
Can you hear me? Callum?
Can you hear me?

662
01:09:31,495 --> 01:09:34,612
- Why don't you answer?
- I can hear you. Where are you?

663
01:09:35,055 --> 01:09:39,571
I'm at the gravel pit.
I've found Stone's body.

664
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:41,924
He's dead.

665
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:46,725
He's burnt to death.
Just like all the others.

666
01:09:49,495 --> 01:09:52,248
The ground here is all scorched.

667
01:09:53,015 --> 01:09:55,575
This is obviously the way they came.

668
01:10:00,975 --> 01:10:06,095
I can see something.
Something glowing down in the pit.

669
01:10:08,055 --> 01:10:10,171
It's getting hotter.

670
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,454
I'm going in.

671
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:19,765
Hanson, remember two people
have already died there.

672
01:10:19,975 --> 01:10:21,806
It's horrible.
What's he doing there?

673
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:40,208
It's very dark in here.
I can't see very far.

674
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:55,372
I can see it again.

675
01:10:59,295 --> 01:11:00,728
It certainly is a light source.

676
01:11:01,695 --> 01:11:03,686
The light seems to be...

677
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:08,854
I'm not receiving you.

678
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:11,330
(high pitched whirring)

679
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:15,684
- Hanson, do you hear me?
- Why doesn't he answer?

680
01:11:16,015 --> 01:11:17,084
Hanson!

681
01:11:20,935 --> 01:11:22,846
He's not coming through.

682
01:11:23,615 --> 01:11:27,085
(high pitched whirring)

683
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,605
It's a woman!
I'll have to stop her.

684
01:11:39,455 --> 01:11:41,286
(screaming)

685
01:11:46,895 --> 01:11:50,012
(Volume increases,
screaming continues)

686
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:02,493
Of course.
The light!

687
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:10,210
What are we going to do?
What the hell are we going to do?

688
01:12:11,295 --> 01:12:14,970
The area beyond the gravel pit
must be their assembly point.

689
01:12:15,175 --> 01:12:17,131
I saw one down there.

690
01:12:17,735 --> 01:12:20,772
What happened? The set went off.
Are you all right?

691
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:24,570
Yes. The aerial must've been
screened by the pit.

692
01:12:24,775 --> 01:12:27,335
I've discovered something
very important.

693
01:12:27,535 --> 01:12:31,926
They're attracted to light.
To them, it's a source of energy.

694
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:34,251
Turn out all your lights.
Do you hear?

695
01:12:34,455 --> 01:12:37,094
Yes, I hear you.
Is there anything else?

696
01:12:37,735 --> 01:12:40,374
No, I'm going on now.

697
01:12:40,775 --> 01:12:42,527
I'll drive without lights.

698
01:12:42,735 --> 01:12:45,693
I'll contact you when I get
to the station.

699
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:51,012
Thank God he's all right.

700
01:13:04,855 --> 01:13:07,767
He must've seen the creatures
themselves.

701
01:13:07,975 --> 01:13:09,772
I wonder how many there are.

702
01:13:22,215 --> 01:13:24,012
I'll get the orange juice.

703
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:29,607
How long do you think
he'll take to get there?

704
01:13:30,455 --> 01:13:33,891
Not long...
If he gets through.

705
01:13:43,575 --> 01:13:47,045
(high pitched whirring)

706
01:13:58,055 --> 01:14:01,047
(volume increases)

707
01:14:42,215 --> 01:14:45,207
(screaming)

708
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:54,563
He ought to be there by now.

709
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:59,247
- Why doesn't he contact us?
- Jeff, don't panic, please.

710
01:15:00,055 --> 01:15:02,808
If it's possible to get through,
he'll manage.

711
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:07,088
How do you know? How do you know
he's not dead as well?

712
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:14,767
It's only five miles to the point.

713
01:15:16,335 --> 01:15:19,054
He ought to be arriving
any moment.

714
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:27,733
Intermediate frequency.
Range four...

715
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:32,251
Four miles? No wonder
we haven't heard from him.

716
01:15:32,455 --> 01:15:35,891
If he's at the Met station,
he's out of range.

717
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:39,610
What do we do if he's out of range?
Do we just wait?

718
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:43,444
- I can't stand it another minute!
- I want to get away too.

719
01:15:43,655 --> 01:15:47,125
- We must go to the Met station.
- Anything's better than this.

720
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:51,374
We'll take your car.
I know a short cut. Come on, darling.

721
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:56,205
I'll drive.
I know the way.

722
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:07,130
We were in the office
when the lights blew.

723
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:10,964
We heard the explosion
and found the operator.

724
01:16:11,535 --> 01:16:15,244
We got him to the wardroom
but he was dead. Burnt to death.

725
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:19,645
That explains it.
That finally explains it.

726
01:16:20,695 --> 01:16:24,483
Would you mind letting us in
on the secret?

727
01:16:24,695 --> 01:16:29,371
Simple. Your station is the means
by which these beings got here.

728
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:31,088
This station?

729
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:36,768
You must be aware that we've been
sending out high frequency impulses

730
01:16:36,975 --> 01:16:38,124
to explore space.

731
01:16:38,655 --> 01:16:40,373
Bouncing signals off stars?

732
01:16:40,735 --> 01:16:45,172
Exactly. To us, these impulses
are useful, but quite harmless.

733
01:16:46,255 --> 01:16:49,247
But to these beings,
they represent a life force.

734
01:16:49,455 --> 01:16:51,207
- I see.
- Do you?

735
01:16:51,495 --> 01:16:55,090
We attracted them, but that doesn't
explain how they got here.

736
01:16:55,415 --> 01:16:57,724
It's quite obvious, isn't it?

737
01:16:57,975 --> 01:17:00,489
They must've homed in
on your scanner.

738
01:17:00,695 --> 01:17:04,654
These beings are composed of high
frequency impulses in heat form.

739
01:17:04,855 --> 01:17:07,608
They transfer like any form
of high frequency.

740
01:17:07,815 --> 01:17:11,091
They transferred here
like a TV picture,

741
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,808
from a transmitter to a receiver.

742
01:17:13,015 --> 01:17:15,654
- Using our scanner as a receiver.
- Exactly.

743
01:17:15,855 --> 01:17:19,086
- Then they materialised on Earth.
- Materialised?

744
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:22,447
In the same way
as a satellite TV picture.

745
01:17:22,655 --> 01:17:26,284
It starts in space as a signal
and then materialises.

746
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:28,965
Do you realise what you're saying?

747
01:17:29,175 --> 01:17:33,373
The Earth's surface is dotted
with TV and radar scanners.

748
01:17:33,655 --> 01:17:38,126
If these beings succeed,
they'll heat up the whole surface.

749
01:17:38,335 --> 01:17:40,405
Earth will be just another
hot planet.

750
01:17:40,895 --> 01:17:43,170
Like so many others
in the constellation.

751
01:17:43,735 --> 01:17:47,887
We've got to stop them. We must
destroy them before they destroy us.

752
01:17:48,135 --> 01:17:50,729
- Have you got any explosives?
- No.

753
01:17:50,935 --> 01:17:53,051
Just a couple of revolvers
and some ammo.

754
01:17:53,255 --> 01:17:56,486
- We've got some flare guns.
- Get them.

755
01:17:57,135 --> 01:18:00,127
Wait, the quarry.
There'll be gelignite there.

756
01:18:00,335 --> 01:18:04,453
- Anybody there you can contact?
- Like hell. I'll get it myself.

757
01:18:04,695 --> 01:18:07,573
I'll be glad to apologise
if we succeed. I'll take the van.

758
01:18:07,895 --> 01:18:11,524
Whatever you do,
don't forget: Drive without lights.

759
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:14,455
I'm getting to be quite a criminal.

760
01:18:17,295 --> 01:18:20,765
She's slowing down.
She'll blow any moment.

761
01:18:22,215 --> 01:18:24,775
Come on, damn you.
Keep going.

762
01:18:25,655 --> 01:18:27,566
(whirring)

763
01:18:27,775 --> 01:18:30,687
It's that noise again.
I can hear it.

764
01:18:48,655 --> 01:18:50,566
- Angela.
- Is she all right?

765
01:18:50,775 --> 01:18:52,288
I missed her. But only just.

766
01:18:53,135 --> 01:18:56,445
She heard you coming and panicked.
Have you seen Hanson?

767
01:18:56,655 --> 01:18:58,008
- He's at the station.
- Good.

768
01:18:58,215 --> 01:18:59,648
They got to us.

769
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:04,089
- Anyone hurt?
- Yes, the operator. Burnt to death.

770
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:06,047
Are you all right?

771
01:19:08,095 --> 01:19:10,529
She's put the car in the ditch.

772
01:19:12,855 --> 01:19:16,086
KEN: I'll give you a hand.
Here, sit down.

773
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:21,649
Under the wheel.

774
01:19:23,935 --> 01:19:27,052
Right, start her up.
All right, push.

775
01:19:28,175 --> 01:19:30,211
Put her in reverse.

776
01:19:38,735 --> 01:19:41,533
I'll take Angela with me.
It'll lighten your load.

777
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:42,884
Right.

778
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:55,330
- Have you contacted the mainland?
- No.

779
01:19:55,535 --> 01:19:57,127
Here, Frankie.

780
01:19:57,775 --> 01:19:58,924
Here we are.

781
01:20:00,655 --> 01:20:03,613
Fine. Tie them in bundles
of three like I told you.

782
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:06,966
This is the plan.
We split up into two groups.

783
01:20:07,175 --> 01:20:08,813
- Is that a good idea?
- It's essential.

784
01:20:09,015 --> 01:20:11,006
You know the hayricks
out on the point?

785
01:20:11,215 --> 01:20:14,651
Foster and I will go up there
and I'll set fire them.

786
01:20:14,855 --> 01:20:19,053
Wait. You said these creatures
were attracted by light.

787
01:20:19,255 --> 01:20:20,973
It'll bring them out into the open.

788
01:20:21,175 --> 01:20:24,087
Foster will intercept them with
the dynamite. I'll double back.

789
01:20:24,295 --> 01:20:26,934
- What'll we do?
- Go to the top of the cliff.

790
01:20:27,135 --> 01:20:30,252
As soon as the fires are alight,
use the flares to alert the mainland.

791
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:34,687
- There's nothing else we can do?
- Has anybody got any better ideas?

792
01:20:37,535 --> 01:20:40,971
It'll take us 15 minutes
to get to the hayricks.

793
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:44,770
When you spot my first flare,
it's your signal to move.

794
01:20:44,975 --> 01:20:46,169
Foster.

795
01:20:47,495 --> 01:20:49,645
Remember, 15 minutes.

796
01:21:02,055 --> 01:21:03,408
Can you see them?

797
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:10,208
Why do you think Hanson
split us into two groups?

798
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:14,728
If he and Foster fail,
it'll be up to us.

799
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:16,807
That's what I thought.

800
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,333
He's a peculiar chap,
but he's got guts.

801
01:21:21,055 --> 01:21:23,888
Angela seems to be taking it badly.

802
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:29,813
If things get tough,
will you look after her?

803
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,165
- Then I can take care of Frankie.
- Sure.

804
01:21:38,455 --> 01:21:40,093
That's it. Let's go.

805
01:22:07,855 --> 01:22:11,086
(high pitched whirring)

806
01:22:15,695 --> 01:22:17,128
Listen.

807
01:22:17,695 --> 01:22:19,208
It's coming from the meadow.

808
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,011
Come on. We must keep going.

809
01:22:27,855 --> 01:22:32,167
(continuous whirring)

810
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:43,969
- Jeff!
- I'll get her. Take this.

811
01:23:01,535 --> 01:23:03,890
(volume increases)

812
01:23:35,335 --> 01:23:37,326
(shouting)

813
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:43,928
Lightning.

814
01:23:47,735 --> 01:23:48,724
Foster!

815
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:55,487
Foster, get out of there!

816
01:24:01,415 --> 01:24:02,734
Foster!

817
01:24:09,055 --> 01:24:10,886
(screams)

818
01:24:23,375 --> 01:24:25,206
(thunder)

819
01:24:33,455 --> 01:24:35,764
You fool.
You could've run into them!

820
01:24:35,975 --> 01:24:37,533
Let me go. Let me go!

821
01:24:38,815 --> 01:24:42,091
- Leave me alone. Let me go.
- You'll do as I say.

822
01:24:42,295 --> 01:24:44,809
In there. It'll be safe.
Come on.

823
01:24:57,015 --> 01:24:59,051
(thunder)

824
01:25:09,775 --> 01:25:11,367
You little idiot.

825
01:25:12,135 --> 01:25:15,491
Who are you to tell me
what to do? It's my life.

826
01:25:15,695 --> 01:25:17,526
You wouldn't stand a chance
on your own.

827
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:19,453
At least we have a chance
by sticking together.

828
01:25:19,695 --> 01:25:22,687
I didn't ask you to come after me.
Go back.

829
01:25:22,895 --> 01:25:26,888
And leave you here? Oh, no.
Like it or not, I'm staying.

830
01:25:27,175 --> 01:25:29,643
I hate you. Leave me alone.

831
01:25:30,215 --> 01:25:33,525
Look, I'm just as scared
as you are.

832
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,332
But... Well, we mustn't give up.

833
01:25:38,615 --> 01:25:41,049
We'll find a way.
I know we will.

834
01:25:42,775 --> 01:25:44,413
(thunder clap)

835
01:26:05,415 --> 01:26:08,725
- How many more flares?
- They're the last.

836
01:26:10,375 --> 01:26:13,367
Whatever happens, Frankie,
stay close.

837
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:21,883
Callum.
The storm, the storm.

838
01:26:23,935 --> 01:26:26,165
(whirring volume increases)

839
01:26:28,775 --> 01:26:31,369
Hanson, run for it!
Run!

840
01:26:32,175 --> 01:26:33,290
Run!

841
01:26:36,975 --> 01:26:38,772
Aaah!

842
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:37,093
It's no good.
Hanson tried to warn us.

843
01:27:37,855 --> 01:27:39,527
They're all around us.

844
01:27:40,615 --> 01:27:41,968
It's the lightning.

845
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:01,766
- I can't stand it. I can't...
- Stop it! Stop it!

846
01:28:11,055 --> 01:28:14,411
I don't want to kill you, but I will
if I have to. Don't stop me.

847
01:28:15,495 --> 01:28:19,044
- You little fool.
- No, you're the fool.

848
01:28:19,255 --> 01:28:22,088
I'd rather die like this
than be burnt alive.

849
01:28:22,415 --> 01:28:25,532
All right. Go on.
Do it, but kill me first.

850
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:28,410
You?

851
01:28:28,935 --> 01:28:32,723
Yes. You're right.
It's hopeless, completely hopeless.

852
01:28:32,935 --> 01:28:35,244
So for once,
do something for someone else.

853
01:28:37,415 --> 01:28:38,734
Go on, shoot.

854
01:28:40,135 --> 01:28:41,363
Damn you.

855
01:28:48,535 --> 01:28:50,253
What is it with you?

856
01:28:50,535 --> 01:28:54,687
Don't you think I'm old enough
to take care of myself?

857
01:29:03,975 --> 01:29:07,251
(high pitched whirring)

858
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:31,013
Look. The rain.

859
01:29:32,295 --> 01:29:33,853
It's killing them.
