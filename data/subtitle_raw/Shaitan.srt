This is a book of serial.

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,289
Just one book.

5
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,053
They are so cheap.

6
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:39,826
Sister, this is cheaper.
- Oh! Get lost.

7
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,624
Sister, this is cheaper.

8
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,630
Sister... sister,

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,731
Sister, this is for you...

11
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,429

12
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,779
O god! Fighting all
the times... take this.

13
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,482
And switch off the tv.

14
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:19,855
Tanya hurry... chirag
saree shoot at 2:00pm.

15
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,327
Hurry up.

16
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,555
I won't do it.

17
00:05:24,633 --> 00:05:26,828
Tanya, i have
already taken an advance.

18
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,368
You'll have to go.

19
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,867
No

20
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,000
tanya...

21
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,381
okay, sir?
- A little lower.

22
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,384
Some more.

23
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:49,788
Lower.

24
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,421
A little higher.

25
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,240
Who's doing it?

26
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:31,827
Bonus points.

27
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:37,396
Wife. Kids. What do you do?

28
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:41,333
Coming at you. I am a
crazy lesbian. Yeah!

29
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,837
There.

30
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:46,546
"Killed me."

31
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,439
"Killed me."

32
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:06,366
Oh god.

33
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,401
Zakir hussain.

34
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,275
It is serious.

35
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:33,784
Had it not been serious...

36
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:36,382
...i wouldn't have come
here to talk to you both.

37
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,885
I can understand she
is in a state of shock...

38
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,825
...because of her mother's death.

39
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,363
She writes her mother's name...

40
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:47,527
...on all her assignments, on
every page, report and book.

41
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:50,771
She is scribbling her
mother's name all over the school.

42
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,432
She has claustrophobia issues.

43
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:56,303
What are you trying to say, ma'am?

44
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:58,344
Please don't get me wrong...

45
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:02,210
...but i seriously feel your
daughter needs clinical treatment.

46
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:04,975
Mr. Jaishankar, i'm
really sorry to say...

47
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,882
...but these are signs
of mental disturbance.

48
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,514
No, please. Just stop here.

49
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:11,658
We know she's been through trauma.

50
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,784
She has already had
enough counselling, ma'am.

51
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:18,899
I don't intend to
hurt your feelings.

52
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,732
I'm just trying to do my job.

53
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:22,736
Then please,
ma'am, just do it right.

54
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:24,437
You can't come here, to
my house and tell me...

55
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:25,597
...that my daughter is going mad.

56
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,234
You are being absolutely unfair.
I have said no such thing.

57
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,503
Please.

58
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:32,304
I have prepared a cheque for
donation. Tara, just give it to her.

59
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,505
I'll be in my study, okay?

60
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:35,845
Jai...
- i tell you...

61
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,547
please. I... i'm really sorry.

62
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,283
I got you.

63
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,688
What's wrong with you, amu?

64
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,455
I am shifting all my
business to bombay.

65
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,434
So many issues to seal with and

66
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,032
on top of that you...

67
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,271
why can't you stop embarrassing us?

68
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:58,703
Make life a little easier for us.

69
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,764
It's not bombay, dad. It's mumbai.

70
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:03,602
What?
- Do you know why it's mumbai?

71
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,406
Because of the goddess mumbadevi.

72
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:08,943
Did you see her photo?

73
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:11,274
She is beautiful.

74
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,843
Amu, your dad is trying to
tell you something, darling.

75
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,857
He is, right? Just
stop interrupting him.

76
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,487
Amu, talk to your mother properly.

77
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:22,688
I always talk
properly with my mother.

78
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:23,924
Amu.

79
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,730
Just forget it.

80
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,561
And you, young lady,
you better get going.

81
00:10:28,636 --> 00:10:30,069
Have you decided what you will wear?

82
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,532
Charu.

83
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,003
Hurry up, charu.

84
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:36,000
Which one? This one or that one?

85
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:40,841
No.

86
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,681
No, i'm not wearing that.

87
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,610
No way.

88
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,599
Hello, mr. Chopra. That too early!

89
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,034
That's great. That's great.

00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:05,499
Look, how scantily dressed she is.

Hello, mr. Chopra.
Whats up with your paunch?

92
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:12,269
Did you eat your children?

93
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:15,544
Yes, they weren't doing
their homework. Hence i...

94
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:18,551

Hi.

100
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,338
I've seen you somewhere.

101
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,408
Didn't like the pickup line?

102
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,822
Do you want to
start a joint account?

103
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,549
I don't smoke.

104
00:12:02,296 --> 00:12:04,025
No, really. I don't smoke.

105
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:10,832
As i child i wanted
to be a gynaecologist.

106
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,500
But nowadays i am
considering an mba.

107
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:17,367
In the meanwhile i'm
squandering my father's money.

108
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:22,472
That's my daddy dearest.

109
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,551
Mr. Rajeshwari chaudhary.

110
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,779
Hail goddess.

111
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,788
And that's my dad.
Mr. Anand jaishankar.

112
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:33,952
Wiping his hand
discreetly after every handshake.

113
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,926
He's so ocd.

114
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,289
You mean ocdk.

115
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,693
What?

116
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:43,565
Anyway, he's a bit fake,
but i love him.

117
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,932
Is that your mom?

118
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,402
No, that's my step mom.

119
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,436
They have been
together since 3 years.

120
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:53,311
Poor thing.

121
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:56,349
It's not her fault.
She was born ugly.

122
00:12:56,617 --> 00:13:00,485
She is not that bad.

123
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:03,021
My mom's prettier.

124
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,690
I'm sure she is.

125
00:13:10,598 --> 00:13:12,964
'It's been 12 years
since i met my mom.'

126
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:15,968
'They keep her
locked up in a tiny room.'

127
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,332
'I miss her so much.'

128
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:23,537
'My sister is the only one i
get along with, in my family.'

129
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,678
'She's been in a
wheelchair since childhood.'

130
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,416
'You know, my mom
has a beautiful smile.'

131
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,778
'She looks just like me.'

132
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:35,715
'Actually, i look just like her.'

133
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:38,686
'You don't like mumbai? '

134
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:40,954
'I like la more.'

135
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,921
'There's a holi party
at my place, day after

136
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,700
'let's make mumbai
colourful for you.'

137
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:50,370
'We just met. Let
me think about it.'

138
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:51,530
'You'll come. I know you will come.'

139
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,744
What's going on?

140
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:05,679
Rajesh?

141
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,387

Looking for some indian spice.

150
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,397
Do you have a boyfriend?

163
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,526
Does it take this long to get beer?

164
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,534
It's recycled. Will it do?

165
00:16:03,371 --> 00:16:05,271
Amrita jaishankar. Tanya.

166
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,829
Tanya. Amrita jaishankar.

00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:08,465
You can also call her amy.

168
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,834
Quiz her if you like.

169
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,778
I need to get myself a drink.
- Hi.

170
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,543
So, hollywood.

171
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,750
How many guys have you slept with?

172
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,251
Do you eat crows?

173
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:22,621
Is the word 'brother' a
relationship or an abuse.

174
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,618
What do you think? We like you?

175
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:28,652
Is the word 'brother' a
relationship or an abuse.

176
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,023
Where does one apply
himani navratna oil?

177
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,788
Okay. Enough. Enough.

178
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,699
You know, hollywood...

179
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:43,338
...friends are of two kinds.

180
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:48,581
Some you can call at 2:00am.

And you know that they
will be there for you.

182
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:56,622
And then the ones whom
you only call at 2:00am.

183
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,452
You must have read the
forwarded emails right?

184
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,360
So, you know that there are
seven rules of friendship.

185
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,458
We have one more rule.

186
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,635
Screw all the rules, no rules.

187
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,409
Yes, there is one thing.

188
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:18,971
There is one thing.

189
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,313
Just one rule. Trust.

190
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,337
Trust.

191
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:47,339
Trust.

192
00:17:47,975 --> 00:17:52,412
You know, hollywood,
trust is like balls. Balls.

193
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,574
It doesn't really
matter if you have them.

194
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,477
But if you don't have them...

195
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:00,781
...you can't play.

196
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:04,486
I don't promise that
we will be there...

197
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,321
...to help you solve
all your problems.

198
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:08,419
Because that's not going to happen.

199
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:14,901
But as long as you are with us,
you will not have any problems.

200
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,538
And that is a promise.

201
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:22,435
Do you know how to swim?
- Yes.

202
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,714
'After kc's long
boring speech, i realised... '

203
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:32,582
'... why people are so
violent during riots? '

204
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:40,656
'Because being a part of something
makes you feel so powerful.'

205
00:18:41,462 --> 00:18:45,694
'Earlier, i used to
feel that life is a wait.'

206
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,291
'A long boring wait.'

207
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:53,764
'Now i feel life is like a movie.'

208
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:57,638
'So what if it's boring.
You can at least forward it.'

209
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:03,267
Do you have a girlfriend?

210
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:05,468
She's dead.

211
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,413
Did you kill her?

212
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:16,618
No.

213
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:19,452
No!

214
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:25,926
Zubin.

215
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,492
Oh, shit.

216
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:41,472
Perfect.

217
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:42,641
Yes.

218
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:06,532
Is it love?

219
00:21:06,907 --> 00:21:08,306
With kc?

220
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,774
Come on, man. She's sweet.

221
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:14,010
She's very down-market.

222
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:18,312
You are so cute when you lie.

223
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,948
Are you hitting on me?

224
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:54,648
What do you see in him anyway?

225
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:57,350
I see myself in him.

226
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:00,727
Then you don't need kc.
You need a mirror.

227
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,378
Arvind! Are you crazy?

228
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:54,812
You are out on bail.

229
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:57,780
We won't gain anything
by doing something here.

230
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,850
Let's go to the
commissioner's office tomorrow.

231
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:04,017
Where are you going? Wait.

232
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,589
Arvind! Arvind!

233
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,404
Where is sir?
- Sir is upstairs.

234
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:29,881
Enjoy the party, buddy.

235
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,544
Please go. Don't bother me.

236
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,052
Have some more.
- Enough. Enough. I'm already full.

237
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:38,519
Sir, if you say 'yes' the work
on building will start soon.

238
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,690
Mr. Mathur.

239
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,892
Back with a warrant?

240
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,532
Oh brother!

241
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,404
Hey, someone go
downstairs and check him.

242
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,534
Hey, what happened?
You pushed him down?

243
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:12,292
Next time if you raise
your hand on any woman

244
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:14,289
...then i will throw you from the
tenth floor and not the first.

245
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:21,766
He will never trouble you again.

246
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,403
What, man. You guys bicker a lot.

247
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:10,773
So much noise!

248
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:14,243
One shouldn't rent out
to young couples like you.

249
00:26:14,748 --> 00:26:19,515
I didn't sleep the whole night.
Not even for a minute.

250
00:26:23,657 --> 00:26:25,386
So many bags?

251
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,552
You are going to your mother's?

252
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,289
Devil.

253
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,316
Fairy.

254
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:02,592
Amy, you will blink now.

255
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:04,329
Yeah?

256
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:09,833
It must hurt.

257
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:21,506
I am the devil, my
eyes are always wide open!

258
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:23,443
No, that's not going to work, amy.

259
00:27:23,951 --> 00:27:27,910
Because i have focus and you don't.

260
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,917
I have another thing
which you don't have.

261
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:33,391
What?

262
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:41,897
Nice try, but no.

263
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:45,430
I would have won.

264
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,802
I think we both
know who would've won.

265
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:51,401
Put your knockers away...
help me clean up this mess

266
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:55,314
your mommies such a hottie.

267
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:00,986
Not ugly like your mom.

268
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,549
Touchy, parsee.

269
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:09,488
What's going on here?

270
00:28:10,364 --> 00:28:12,662
Eye lock.
- Eye lock. I want to play.

271
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,462
I also want to play. I also
want to play. Play with me.

272
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:15,627
What do i need to do?

273
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:18,461
Eye lock.

274
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:39,852
No. No. No.

275
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:44,795
Kc, i am starving. Let's go out.

276
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:48,559
I am not going out.
- Oh c'mon let's go out.

277
00:28:49,403 --> 00:28:50,927
Son, cook something, will you?

278
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:53,666
Stuff your son up. I
am not sanjeev kapoor.

279
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,538
Order and pay for it.

280
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,504
Move.

281
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:00,947
Kc. Come on, let's go out.

282
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,813
Anything for you, hollywood.

283
00:29:03,683 --> 00:29:05,275
Let's have a midnight buffet.

284
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:09,814
There's no romance
in a midnight buffet.

285
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,320
Romance lies in
scrambled eggs and bun.

286
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:14,853
Scrambled eggs and bun.

287
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,444
Parsee, let's have
some drinks now. What say?

288
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:34,344
Dad's bar is closed.
- Oh.

289
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:37,540
So what will we do now?

290
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:48,327
What flavours do
you have in condoms?

291
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:50,488
Condoms. - Do you have strawberry?
I want strawberry.

292
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,928
Strawberry.
- I don't have strawberry.

293
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,660
You don't? Apricot?
- You have apricot?

294
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:56,463
I don't have apricot.
- You don't?

295
00:29:56,536 --> 00:29:58,299
Then what do you have?
- Not a problem.

296
00:29:58,371 --> 00:29:59,599
And...

297
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,833
amy, will litchee do?

298
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:02,397
It will be great. It will be great.

299
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:03,909
I don't have litchee.
- 'Kala khatta' (java plum)?

300
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:05,410
'Kala khatta'?

301
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:11,543
Do one thing. 2 litchees.
2 chocolates. And...

302
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:14,720
4 strawberries. Parcel it.

303
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,062
Wait. Wait. Wait.
- Run. Run. Run.

304
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:31,804
Wait. Wait. Wait.

305
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:36,033
What difference does it make if the
cough syrup is for kids or adults?

306
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,435
You wasted time unnecessarily.

307
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:40,378
Expiry date. Eh e e e
e e e e sexpiry date.

308
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:44,313
I was checking the expiry date.

309
00:30:45,018 --> 00:30:49,785
"My heart is beating.
Keeps on repeating."

310
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,793
"My heart is beating.
Keeps on repeating."

311
00:30:55,095 --> 00:30:58,690
"My heart is beating. Keeps on..."
- sing the next line dude...

312
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:03,527
"i don't know what the lyrics are."

313
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,769
"I'm waiting for you."

314
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:14,509
"My heart is beating.
Keeps on repeating."

315
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:17,477
"He's waiting for me."

316
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:18,813
Oh, so sweet.

317
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:24,555
Tanya, what do you
call a crazy vibrator?

318
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,884
What?

319
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:29,962
"Dildo is crazy. Dildo is insane."

320
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,725
"Dildo is crazy."
- "Dildo is crazy."

321
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,029
"Dildo is insane."
- "Dildo is insane."

322
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:38,567
"Dildo is crazy. Dildo is insane."

323
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:40,372
Zubi! Zubi! Zubi! Zubi!

324
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,930
Go. Go. Go. Go for it.

325
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:44,738
Go slow. Go slow, please.
- Game on, brother.

326
00:31:47,414 --> 00:31:49,473
Kc, hold this. Kc, hold this.
- Slow down. Slow down.

327
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:59,318
Fuck you.

328
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,890
Fuck you.

329
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:10,759
Go. Go. Go.

330
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,365
Fuck you!

331
00:34:50,997 --> 00:34:53,727
Kc, get a cab and go home.

332
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:57,761
Get a cab and go home.

333
00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:00,871
I'll drop them and keep the car
in the restaurant for the night.

334
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:04,434
We will take the car to
tarun's in the morning.

335
00:35:04,944 --> 00:35:06,639
Let it be there for some days.

336
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,980
We could have saved them.
- Did anyone see us?

337
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,513
There was no one there.

338
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,346
We could have saved them.

339
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:20,521
It's okay. It's okay.

340
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,572
Get me its address.

341
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:18,804
Okay, tell me.

342
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,740
063...

343
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:53,998
look, boss.

344
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:57,037
Here the courts are no different
from local vegetable markets

345
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:59,437
everything is on sale here.

346
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:03,440
If you don't buy it at the
right time, your case will also...

347
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,288
...will rot like stale cauliflowers.

348
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,489
He is judge sinha's
close associate.

349
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:12,751
He will suppress the case.

350
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:16,591
And if that happens then
you can have your job back.

351
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,889
Ok?

352
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:19,590
Come.

353
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,727
Do you have cash?

354
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,596
Come.

355
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,706
I'll do the talking inside.

356
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:29,401
Hello. Okay?

357
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,608
Yes. Yes. No, sir, i remember.
- Come in.

358
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,977
Well...

359
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,274
You will get 23 carriages
in two hours, sir. Yes. Yes.

360
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:39,511
Yes, sir.

361
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,349
And... the wedding decorator?
- Yes, sir. I have spoken to him.

362
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,754
Don't worry, sir. Okay, sir.

363
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,850
Okay, sir. I'll
come in the afternoon.

364
00:39:48,695 --> 00:39:50,663
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

365
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,865
Has he got it?
- Yes, he has.

366
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,503
Take it out. Take it out. Hello.

367
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:09,913
It's rs.50,000, mr. Yadav.

368
00:40:10,516 --> 00:40:12,677
That... mathur case...

369
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:16,344
the corporators case? The one he
flung from the first floor, right?

370
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:18,413
Yes, that's the one.
That's the one. Yes.

371
00:40:21,894 --> 00:40:24,419
Good. Very good.

372
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:30,863
Be it a cop or a peon,
everyone come to me ultimately.

373
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:32,665
To get their job done.

374
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,975
Dilbar.
- Coming, sir. I'm here, sir.

375
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:39,705
Hurry up.
- Hello, sir.

376
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,646
What is this ballu? Same old stuff?

377
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:44,940
Dilbar.
- Yes?

378
00:40:45,017 --> 00:40:47,383
You brought her last
week as well, right?

379
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:48,681
Are the girls on strike?

380
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:50,916
No, sir. All the girls are on duty.

381
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,424
Mr. Yadav, please manage just once.

382
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,085
I'll make better
arrangements next time.

383
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:56,453
Okay. Okay. Fine.

384
00:40:56,529 --> 00:40:57,757
Ballu.
- Yes.

385
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,923
Kapari was here in the afternoon.
- Okay.

386
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,830
He was saying you...

387
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:04,661
you...

388
00:41:04,737 --> 00:41:06,261
why are you hitting me?

389
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:08,301
What are you doing?

390
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,812
Help me. - Do you want
me dead? Are you crazy?

391
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:19,716
You won't be spared.
You... you are done for.

392
00:41:19,786 --> 00:41:21,481
Why are you hitting him?

393
00:41:49,749 --> 00:41:50,977
Sorry i'm late.

394
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,878
Traffic is crazy.

395
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:56,849
There.

396
00:42:03,696 --> 00:42:04,890
Sorry.

397
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,898
What did i miss?

398
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:15,034
Why?

399
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:18,034
What are you trying to
prove by doing all this?

400
00:42:23,015 --> 00:42:25,006
What does she want to prove
by wearing saira's clothes...

401
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:26,814
...and make-up and
doing all this? Tell me.

402
00:42:26,986 --> 00:42:28,783
At least somebody remembers mom.

403
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:39,725
Just leave. Leave now.

404
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,963
Amy...
- just leave me alone.

405
00:42:46,038 --> 00:42:47,528
Please.

406
00:42:49,575 --> 00:42:50,803
Please.

407
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:05,421
Yes, zubin. What happened?
- Somethings happened.

408
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,796
No, i can't come right now.
- Its serious, just come

409
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:14,696
fine. Where?

410
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:21,569
Why are we meeting here?
- You see the stairs? Come upstairs.

411
00:43:21,674 --> 00:43:22,971
Okay, i'm coming up.

412
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:25,669
Yes, i'm coming up
the stairs right now.

413
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,468
Yes.

414
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,455
Why have you called me here?
- Just come.

415
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,649
What's going on?

416
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,354
It won't take me even two
minutes to arrest all of you.

417
00:43:41,427 --> 00:43:42,655
You know that, don't you?

418
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:45,589
Who is she?

419
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,690
Is she that junkie's sister?
- Sir, she...

420
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,064
who the hell is this idiot?
- Amy, please...

421
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,303
what did she say?
- Amy, he's a cop. He knows...

422
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,803
what did she say?
- What does he know?

423
00:43:52,872 --> 00:43:55,397
What is your name?
What is your name?

424
00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:56,907
Amy.
- Amy what?

425
00:43:56,943 --> 00:43:59,434
Amrita jaishankar.
- Amrita jaishankar.

426
00:43:59,645 --> 00:44:00,839
Shut your face.
- Amy. Amy, please.

427
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,938
You guys...
- keep quiet.

428
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,538
Keep quiet, amy. Please.

429
00:44:03,616 --> 00:44:04,810
Keep quiet.
- What?

430
00:44:04,884 --> 00:44:06,647
Just because he is a cop
i should touch his feet?

431
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,948
Amy
- keep quiet, please.

432
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,749
He's playing with us. - No.
Sir. Sir. No, sir. Please, wait,

433
00:44:09,822 --> 00:44:11,414
don't you see he's playing games
with us? - Please sit down, sir.

434
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,684
What do you want?
- Amy, just keep quiet.

435
00:44:12,758 --> 00:44:14,316
What do you want? Tell me.
- Amy, please...

436
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:16,588
shut up, amy. Shut up.

437
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,026
Who is she? Who is she?
- Sir. Sir, you please...

438
00:44:22,301 --> 00:44:23,427
who is she?
- Sorry, sir.

439
00:44:23,502 --> 00:44:24,992
Have a seat, sir. Let's talk, sir.

440
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:27,295
What are you staring at?
- Sir, you...

441
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,637
sir. Sir. Sir. Forget her,
sir. We are talking to you, sir.

442
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,405
Have a seat. Please
have a seat. Have a seat.

443
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,036
Amy, please, just
shut up, okay? Please.

444
00:44:34,313 --> 00:44:35,473
Please keep quiet.

445
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:40,377
You told me that you want to
settle this. That's why i am here.

446
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,582
Otherwise, i would be thrashing
all of you in prison, right now.

447
00:44:43,823 --> 00:44:45,313
Sir, you tell me
what needs to be done.

448
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,757
What... what will you do?
- Compromise.

449
00:44:56,936 --> 00:44:58,403
25 lakhs.

450
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,036
I'll take 25 lakhs.

451
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,400
Sir, from where will
we arrange for 25 lakhs?

452
00:45:04,477 --> 00:45:07,344
Bastard. You want me to
tell you where to get it from?

453
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,812
I'll tell you from
where you will get it?

454
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,979
You have killed two people.
You know that, don't you?

455
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:19,623
You'll get the money from where
you get the booze and these sluts.

456
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,487
I could have gone to your parents.

457
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,491
But i am here
because you asked me to.

458
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:25,289
You know that. You
know that, don't you?

459
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:27,931
You will get your money.

460
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:32,597
Smartass, you have two days.

461
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,335
I can't hush the witness
for more than two days.

462
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:36,802
Got it?

463
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:41,309
If i get my money, all
of us will be happy.

464
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,014
Otherwise, i am sure
to get a promotion.

465
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,778
Get that.

466
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:50,850
And if you try to run
away then you know...

467
00:45:54,527 --> 00:45:55,687
two days.

468
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:41,498
Look...

469
00:46:41,907 --> 00:46:43,966
don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

470
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:46,469
I guess cocaine is
still in your system.

471
00:46:47,379 --> 00:46:50,041
The cop wants 25 lakhs,
not 25 thousand.

472
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:52,773
I always wanted to rob a bank.

473
00:46:52,985 --> 00:46:54,748
Everything is
happening because of you.

474
00:46:55,387 --> 00:46:57,548
All these bloody school
boys wanted to impress you.

475
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,287
We have become murderers now.

476
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,655
Stop calling this a
bloody murder, okay?

477
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:02,250
It was an accident.

478
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,654
You were also with us.

479
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:05,492
Yes, but you were the
one driving the car, kc.

480
00:47:05,564 --> 00:47:06,690
Tanya.

481
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,566
If we have 25 lakhs
then it's an accident.

482
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,305
Otherwise, it's a murder.

483
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,002
Your father is not
a sheikh in dubai.

484
00:47:18,777 --> 00:47:20,005
He's a sheikh's driver.

485
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:21,908
From where will you get the money?

486
00:47:26,018 --> 00:47:27,781
From where will we get the money?

487
00:47:37,296 --> 00:47:39,287
A dead elephant is still valuable

488
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,562
our elephant is still alive.

489
00:47:43,536 --> 00:47:45,436
Elephant.

490
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,298
The one that you drive.

491
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,671
What are you saying, dash?
Why don't you talk straight?

492
00:47:55,681 --> 00:47:56,909
Tokyo sam's.

493
00:48:01,554 --> 00:48:02,885
'We'll sell your car.'

494
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:05,890
'We'll get 25 lakhs.'

495
00:48:06,392 --> 00:48:07,518
Boom.

496
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,553
Boom.

497
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,787
And we can say that
the car was stolen.

498
00:48:13,232 --> 00:48:15,325
Great and kc's dad
will lodge a complaint.

499
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,561
And thanks to your
hummer's hi-tech gps system...

500
00:48:17,636 --> 00:48:20,002
...we will be behind bars. Game over.

501
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:22,670
And what will i tell my dad?

502
00:48:22,741 --> 00:48:24,504
The car got lost
while i was driving it?

503
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,305
It's a car, not a mobile phone.

504
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,009
Guys, let's steal
his mother's jewellery.

505
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,546
Been there and done that.

506
00:48:32,885 --> 00:48:34,318
You remember what
happened last time?

507
00:48:34,386 --> 00:48:35,876
You stole from your employees?

508
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,752
Tell me. Tell me.
- We are innocent, sir.

509
00:48:37,823 --> 00:48:39,723
Tell me, where have
you hidden the stash?

510
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,384
We didn't steal anything, sir.
- I don't know, sir.

511
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,722
Tell me the truth.
- I don't know, sir.

512
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,786
Where have you hidden the stash?
- Sir, i don't know anything.

513
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:48,731
I am innocent, sir.
- We are innocent, sir.

514
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,030
Ok. Wait wait wait.

515
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,668
Wait a minute... you
want to sell my car.

516
00:48:52,905 --> 00:48:54,736
Steal my mother's jewellery.

517
00:48:54,873 --> 00:48:56,898
Am i the only money
bags in this city?

518
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:59,010
You always carry so much money

519
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:02,878
of course, you are the only
rich guy who has committed murder.

520
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,549
I mean accident.

521
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:08,811
Guys, why don't we just go
and talk to our parents?

522
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,553
Yes. - They are our parents.
They will understand.

523
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:12,852
Are you kidding?

524
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:14,984
My dad is on a project
commissioned by the government.

525
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,519
Everything will be over
if such a news gets out.

526
00:49:17,596 --> 00:49:20,531
And you know my father.
He's a saint.

527
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:24,327
He will disown me.

528
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,740
What about the marbles.
Balls. Trust.

529
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,706
The things kc always
keeps barking about.

530
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,708
Really?
- That's just his... - barking?

531
00:49:35,748 --> 00:49:37,943
Barking?
- Shomu. Shomu.

532
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,644
Oh, yes. We have to stick together.
- Shomu.

533
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,448
That's what we are doing.
We are sticking together.

534
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,010
Shomu.

535
00:49:45,557 --> 00:49:46,888
'My friend, shomu.'

536
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:49,889
Hi. Shomu.

537
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:54,296
'Shomu was sitting on the dinner
table and glaring at his mother.'

538
00:49:56,402 --> 00:49:58,870
'But why was he doing that? '

539
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:01,431
Flashback.

540
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:03,270
'Shomu, this is
already a flashback.'

541
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,840
Then it's a
flashback in a flashback.

542
00:50:07,479 --> 00:50:09,572
'Once, shomu was in deep slumber.'

543
00:50:09,648 --> 00:50:13,914
'His mother found uncut cocaine
worth 10 lakhs in his bag.'

544
00:50:16,422 --> 00:50:19,016
'His mother very affectionately
flushed the cocaine.'

545
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,725
'And gave shomu a tight slap.'

546
00:50:22,328 --> 00:50:24,728
'While munching on
the dinner table... '

547
00:50:24,797 --> 00:50:28,528
'... shomu greedy gaze/shifted/towards
his small, chubby brother... '

548
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,333
'... who was sitting on his
father's lap and gobbling sweets.'

549
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,928
'Then an idea flashed

550
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,966
'step one. Mix pills
into chocolate mousse.'

551
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:45,080
'Step two. Hidechubby
monu under his own bed.'

552
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,979
Call them now. - 'step three.
He called his friend.'

553
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:52,389
Okay.

554
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:57,492
'Step four. Shomu's friend
calls up shomu's father.'

555
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:02,733
'And demands a ransom of 20 lakhs.'

556
00:51:02,835 --> 00:51:03,961
What?

557
00:51:05,304 --> 00:51:09,707
'Step five. Shomu stops his
father from calling the cops.'

558
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,005
'He diverts his
attention towards his mother.'

559
00:51:12,378 --> 00:51:13,572
Monu.

560
00:51:14,646 --> 00:51:16,978
Mama, ask papa to save monu.

561
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:19,039
Papa, please save monu. Papa.

562
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:21,411
'Then some television
serial acting.'

563
00:51:22,054 --> 00:51:24,818
Papa, please, papa. Save him.

564
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,517
My monu.

565
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:29,758
'And your dish is ready.'

566
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:32,588
'His father's bags the money,'

567
00:51:38,003 --> 00:51:39,937
'shomu's friend picks the money.'

568
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:44,036
'Shomu gets a 'payment
received' confirmation.'

569
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,755
'After the confirmation shomu
prepared for family reunion.'

570
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:09,724
Mama. Look, mama,
monu is back. Mama.

571
00:52:09,802 --> 00:52:11,702
Mama, look, monu is back.

572
00:52:12,538 --> 00:52:15,371
Look, mama, there he is.

Monu.

00:52:24,316 --> 00:52:28,480
monu. Monu, say something.

577
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,448
'Family reunion.'

578
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:46,733
Then what happened to shomu?

579
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:51,834
The cocaine shomu's mum
flushed was worth 10 lakhs.

580
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:57,504
Shomu's chubby,
brother was worth 20 lakhs.

581
00:52:58,016 --> 00:53:00,644
Profit, 10 lakhs.

582
00:53:02,488 --> 00:53:06,549
By the way, these days shomu
is backpacking in amsterdam.

583
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,353
Let's do it. We should do it.

584
00:53:12,364 --> 00:53:14,958
We can do it. We
will do it. Let's do it.

585
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:16,330
Should we?
- Yes.

586
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,459
Yes?
- Yes.

587
00:53:17,503 --> 00:53:18,595
Sure?
- Yes.

588
00:53:21,006 --> 00:53:24,874
Ya?! Sounds good? You keep feeding
him with these ridiculous stories...

589
00:53:25,477 --> 00:53:26,808
...and he falls for it everytime.

590
00:53:26,879 --> 00:53:29,973
Do you have a better idea?
Will you give 25 lakhs to the cop?

591
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:31,940
Kc, what are you saying?

592
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,442
We'll kidnap someone?
- Yes.

593
00:53:34,686 --> 00:53:35,914
Kc, this...

594
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:38,456
i don't want to go
behind bars, tanya. Do you?

595
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,553
Do you want to go behind bars?
- Okay. Chill.

596
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:42,660
Assume that we kidnap someone.

597
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:44,656
Who will we kidnap?

598
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:46,994
Your handicapped sister?

599
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,666
Or my brother who is
in the boarding school?

600
00:53:49,902 --> 00:53:51,665
Or tanya's...
- me.

601
00:53:52,538 --> 00:53:54,369
What?
- Yes.

602
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:57,468
My dad's rich. New in town.
Loves me a lot.

603
00:53:57,843 --> 00:53:59,470
Make a phone call.

604
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:02,275
He'll melt.

605
00:54:02,347 --> 00:54:03,541
Will your dad pay up?

606
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:06,375
Okay, but if your
dad's rich, new in town...

607
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,386
...loves you a lot then why
don't ask him for money?

608
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:10,915
Exactly.

609
00:54:11,557 --> 00:54:13,388
Because i don't want
to go to a convent.

610
00:54:13,492 --> 00:54:14,584
Convent?

611
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,595
If my dad even gets a hint
about what happened last night...

612
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:19,296
...that's where im heading.

613
00:54:22,768 --> 00:54:25,635
Will your dad pay up?
- Yes.

614
00:54:26,538 --> 00:54:27,937
Of course. He loves me.

615
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,436
Okay. Fine. If we
are kidnapping amy...

616
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,774
...we'll cab it to her
house in the morning.

617
00:54:33,845 --> 00:54:36,370
And dads bungalow in khandala...

618
00:54:36,448 --> 00:54:38,006
we can stay there.
- No, the bungalow in nerul.

619
00:54:38,283 --> 00:54:39,682
Perfect. Okay?

620
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,617
I'll make the plan.

621
00:54:45,724 --> 00:54:47,749
You will go to
college as usual, tomorrow.

622
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:50,288
As soon as the driver leaves...

623
00:54:52,364 --> 00:54:53,729
as soon as the driver leaves...

624
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:56,063
...i'll take a cab
from outside college.

625
00:55:01,373 --> 00:55:02,601
'No, no, no.'

626
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:04,674
'Come back. Come back.'

627
00:55:07,813 --> 00:55:10,680
'Not from outside'

628
00:55:10,716 --> 00:55:11,808
then?

629
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,884
'You will walk.'
- Okay.

630
00:55:15,454 --> 00:55:16,580
'Keep walking.'

631
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:18,253
'Keep walking.'

632
00:55:18,423 --> 00:55:19,685
'Keep walking.'

633
00:55:19,992 --> 00:55:21,391
'Stop. Stop. Stop.'

634
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,325
'Now take a cab from here.'

635
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,278
Now what?

00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:12,384
I checked the messages. Everything.

701
00:59:12,624 --> 00:59:13,818

least looked into this.

704
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,753
You should have checked.

705
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:21,822
You should've told me. But we have...

706
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:23,701
sir.
- You have to calm down, jai.

707
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,531
I am calm. I am...
- he is trying to do his job, jai.

708
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,401
No. What? What?
Nothing is being done.

709
00:59:27,706 --> 00:59:29,571
Which floor did you throw him from?

710
00:59:31,576 --> 00:59:32,668
First.

711
00:59:32,811 --> 00:59:36,372
He's a corporater. You
know that, don't you?

712
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:38,716
That's why i threw him
from the first floor, sir.

713
00:59:45,323 --> 00:59:46,517
Look, mathur...

714
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:51,954
...it's not that the department
is suddenly in love with you

715
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:54,662
it's simple.

716
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:59,767
Its a kidnapping case of
this nri's 18-year-old daughter.

717
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,935
The home minister
has called, thrice.

718
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:05,940
Elections are around the corner.

719
01:00:07,012 --> 01:00:10,448
When these politicians get a chance,
they don't lose the opportunity.

720
01:00:10,582 --> 01:00:13,312
They will screw us cops.

721
01:00:13,418 --> 01:00:14,749
What orders do you have
for me, sir?

722
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,717
You have a good network.

723
01:00:17,022 --> 01:00:18,751
I'll give you the men you want.

724
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,619
You are suspended hence i
can't take you in officially.

725
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:25,790
But you have to handle this case.

726
01:00:26,298 --> 01:00:28,789
Without making noise.
At the earliest.

727
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:14,376
Did you contact rehmat?

728
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:15,774
He's not answering the phone.

729
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:17,875
Get his address.

730
01:01:22,954 --> 01:01:24,319
Her mother.

731
01:01:26,758 --> 01:01:28,953
I'm her step-mom.

732
01:01:29,995 --> 01:01:34,728
Its been twelve years since her
mum passed on in a mental asylum.

733
01:01:34,866 --> 01:01:36,390
Problems in your family?

734
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:38,727
Which family doesn't have problems?

735
01:01:41,773 --> 01:01:43,434
I've given the phone
numbers and details...

736
01:01:43,508 --> 01:01:46,375
...of all her friends to the
officer sitting downstairs.

737
01:02:22,747 --> 01:02:24,305
'We just got the news... '

738
01:02:24,382 --> 01:02:26,816
'... that mr. Anand jaishankar's
daughter got kidnapped.'

739
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,526
'The kidnapers have called
just once for the ransom.'

740
01:02:40,765 --> 01:02:43,859
'Mumbai police commissioner
has assigned a special team.'

741
01:02:44,035 --> 01:02:45,627
These are her four friends.

742
01:02:46,438 --> 01:02:48,770
Karan chaudhary. Zubin shroff.
Tanya sharma and this guy.

743
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,668
Her parents haven't met him.

744
01:02:50,742 --> 01:02:51,766
Pandey.
- Sir.

745
01:02:51,843 --> 01:02:53,037
I want all the details
on the four of them.

746
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:54,471
Where do their friends,
parents go and what they do.

747
01:02:54,546 --> 01:02:56,844
The fun they have. Everything.

748
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,813
Are amrita's friends
behind her kidnapping?

749
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:09,911
Or is it a case of
multiple kidnapping?

750
01:04:09,988 --> 01:04:12,548
The police have refused
to comment.

751
01:04:12,624 --> 01:04:14,353
As of now the parents
are in a state of shock.

752
01:04:14,425 --> 01:04:15,949
They have refused to
speak to the media.

753
01:04:16,027 --> 01:04:17,426
The three missing
friends are tanya sharma...

754
01:04:17,495 --> 01:04:20,328
...zubin shroff and karan chaudhary.

755
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,258
Move. Move back. No comments.

756
01:04:26,037 --> 01:04:27,470
Move back.

757
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:30,599
No comments.
- Sir. Sir. Sir, please.

758
01:04:30,675 --> 01:04:32,472
Leave us alone.
Please leave us alone.

759
01:04:32,544 --> 01:04:35,377
Please leave us alone.

760
01:04:35,613 --> 01:04:40,516
My sister tanya sharma
just signed a three film deal.

761
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,611
I feel a leading
actress is behind this.

762
01:04:43,688 --> 01:04:44,848
Do you suspect anyone, madam?

763
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:47,858
No, i can't take names. I'm sorry.

764
01:04:49,661 --> 01:04:51,322
The phones of the missing
four are off since morning.

765
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,021
Any information on
the fourth person?

766
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:55,459
The fourth person's name.
Dushant sahu.

767
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:57,330
He works at a
coffee shop carter road.

768
01:04:57,402 --> 01:04:59,632
He has been arrested
thrice because of drugs.

769
01:04:59,704 --> 01:05:01,569
That too in three different states.

770
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,400
That means in three hours
a single kidnapping case...

771
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:06,341
...has turned into a
multiple kidnapping case.

772
01:05:06,477 --> 01:05:08,604
Was this case given
to me to screw me?

773
01:05:17,755 --> 01:05:21,691
Karan is the sole heir to my
business worth 500 crores.

774
01:05:22,026 --> 01:05:25,928
And you are ignoring my son's case
because of an american's daughter.

775
01:05:26,364 --> 01:05:28,924
I have'nt raised my
sister on peanuts.

776
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,265
It has only been a few hours.

777
01:05:32,704 --> 01:05:34,865
And we are taking this
case very seriously.

778
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:53,382
Dushant sahu is
your roommate, right?

779
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:56,055
Where is he? Where are his friends?

780
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,295
He is missing since last night.

781
01:05:58,730 --> 01:06:03,463
I know nothing

782
01:06:03,534 --> 01:06:06,401
a new revelation in the
amrita jaishankar kidnapping case.

783
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:09,404
We've figured that
amrita and her friends'...

784
01:06:09,474 --> 01:06:11,374
...friends can be
behind their kidnapping.

785
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:14,536
Amrita jaishankar's father who is
a famous government contractor...

786
01:06:14,612 --> 01:06:16,580
...has been asked to
pay a ransom of 3 crores.

787
01:06:16,648 --> 01:06:18,639
So where exactly is
amrita jaishankar?

788
01:06:37,435 --> 01:06:38,595
Look up.

789
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:58,545
Mr. Kibla rehmatullah
khan at your service.

790
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:05,677
"My love, you..."

791
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:10,820
"your love..."

792
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,294
"my..."

793
01:07:13,762 --> 01:07:15,821
what the hell.

794
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,160
Who is it?
- Son...

795
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,759
hurry up, son, your wife will age.

796
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,098
Hurry
- i'm coming.

797
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,297
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

798
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:24,669
Let me wear my pants. Do
you want me to come naked?

799
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:29,576
Oh, god. Hurry up.
- Go. I'm coming. Go. Go.

800
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:37,579
"My love..."

801
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,888
who is it? - Uncle, they
are calling you downstairs.

802
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:44,285
Bugger off. Scoot! "they
are calling you downstairs."

803
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:52,596
"My love..."

804
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,460
who is it?

805
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,463
Sir!

806
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,770
Mr. Mathur, listen to me.
- He is taking your son.

807
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:01,070
Why are you taking him away?

808
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,805
Listen to me, mr. Mathur.

809
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,809
Mr. Mathur, i... i was
going to answer your phone.

810
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,760
Okay, why are we at vijay
mallay's kingfisher villa?

811
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:20,787
Dash, come in. Dash, come in. Dash.

812
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,630
Dash must have
thought of something right?

813
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:25,189
Dash.
- Balls.

814
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,325
Look at this place.

815
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,195
What food do you want?

816
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:30,863
Food.

817
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,640
Such an exciting place.

818
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:36,876
My arse.

819
01:08:37,112 --> 01:08:40,843
You outsiders always find
the filth in india exciting.

820
01:08:41,116 --> 01:08:44,608
Blah. Blah. Blah.

821
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,177
Such nags.

822
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,847
Dash, tell them about the plan.

823
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,615
Are you done with your shit?

824
01:08:53,128 --> 01:08:54,152
This is my friend's lodge.

825
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:57,158
It's obvious from its looks.

826
01:08:58,133 --> 01:09:00,192
Don't talk, listen.

827
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:05,698
My friend will be coming here
with an unregistered sim card.

828
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,709
We'll make our next and perhaps
our last phone call from it.

829
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,170
Hi, my name is zubin.

830
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,373
I am a parsee boy.

831
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,680
I play with myself as well
while playing videogames.

832
01:09:25,527 --> 01:09:26,551
Sir.

833
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,395
Mr. Mathur, please let me go.

834
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,601
Sir, my informer will
be here soon.

835
01:09:35,537 --> 01:09:38,404
Sir, have i ever given
you wrong information?

836
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,238
Sir, you have stripped me
from the middle of my wedding.

837
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,743
It's a sin, sir.

838
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,237
Sir, please let me go.

839
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,679
Sir, i'm starting afresh

840
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,150
what's the point in
getting married?

841
01:09:50,252 --> 01:09:51,310
What will you do?

842
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,148
Everything will be over in 8 months.

843
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,557
And your wife will leave
with the painting you paid for.

844
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,160
He wants to start
a new life he says.

845
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:03,556
Sir, panting? Sir?

846
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:08,227
Two. Three. Four.

847
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:12,299
Stupid.

848
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,069
Where will we ask
him to get the money?

849
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:16,671
Outside that shop?

850
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,679
Or that one
selling bras and panties?

851
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:20,539
Chill, parsee.

852
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,218
What about the police?

853
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:24,851
Why do you ask so many questions?

854
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,787
What if amy's dad brings
the police?

855
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,357
Then we will cut amy
into tiny pieces...

856
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,861
...and feed her to the dogs.
- No.

857
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,723
Kc, zubi has got a point here.

858
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:39,130
Okay. Okay. No need for drama

859
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:40,692
save that for your
television serials.

860
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:42,261
Get lost.

861
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,196
Zubi, give me the phone.
I want to call my sister.

862
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:46,332
No phone calls.

863
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,743
If we switch on the phone there
is a risk of being tracked down.

864
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,847
Track down? Who will track us down?

865
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:54,546
Police?
- Maybe.

866
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,347
If and only if amy's dad
has told them everything.

867
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,155
That means until now you
guys where confident...

868
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,191
...that the cops aren't involved.

869
01:11:03,258 --> 01:11:04,384
And suddenly it's a maybe.

870
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:08,559
Tell me, kc, why did you
get kareena kapoor along?

871
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:09,822
For saif.

872
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,692
Kareena. Saif.

873
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:16,294
Hey guys, seriously, this is
not a 'safe' place to meet.

874
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:20,504
That's really funny, man.
- That's a good parsee come back.

875
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,140
Hello, sir.

876
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,304
It's confirmed news. A
15-16 year old girl.

877
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,847
Looks european. Golden hair.

878
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:27,514
Did you see any weapons there?
- No, sir.

879
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,811
I didn't see any weapons.

880
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,518
But yes, the girl was coked up.

881
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:33,678
Let's go.

882
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,520
Sir. Sir. Sir. Can i leave?
- Go.

883
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,341
Amy. Amy, look here.

884
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:01,671
Amy, look at this. Look at this.

885
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,278
'The kidnapping case
of amrita jaishankar... '

886
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:08,186
'... has taken a completely new turn.'

887
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,350
'Right now the police are not
only looking for this young girl... '

888
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,291
'... but also for three
of her friends

889
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:13,794
'... who disappeared
the same time as her.'

890
01:12:14,062 --> 01:12:16,292
'There has been no ransom call
to any of her other friends.'

891
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,299
'And the police
are yet to confirm... '

892
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,494
'... whether the friends are the
victims or indeed the kidnappers.'

893
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,431
There's a lot of speculation
where the youngster might be hiding.

894
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,473
The police
currently traced the call...

895
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:39,118
leave me. Brother,
whom have you brought?

896
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,383
Help! You want to put
me in trouble?

897
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,720
Kc. Kc.

898
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,391
Bolt the door. Leave me.

899
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,658
'We now have pictures of
the four missing youngsters.'

900
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:53,462
'The parents have
offered reward to anyone... '

901
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,060
...who can provide the police with
information on their whereabouts.'

902
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:08,308
Leave me! Leave me!

903
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:11,377
Help!

904
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:12,476
Help!

905
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,488
Do you want us killed?
Let go of her.

906
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,093
Shut up! Shut up, you witch!

907
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:29,299
Leave me! Leave me!

908
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:34,298
Who are you?
- How can you just barge in?

909
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:35,434
Leave.
- Get out of here.

910
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:36,569
I said get out of here.

911
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,806
Sit down.
- How dare you come inside?

912
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,378
Sit down. Sit down.

913
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,383
You are pointing a gun
at me in front of a kid?

914
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:44,810
Help! Help!

915
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:48,817
Who are you?
- Get out of here.

916
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,353
Get out. - You are pointing a
gun at me in front of a kid?

917
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:51,653
I said sit down. Raise your hands.

918
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:52,785
I told you.
- Yes...

919
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,055
shut up! Shut up!

920
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,274
No.

921
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,592
Don't you have any shame?

922
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:28,789
You are pointing a gun at
me in front of a kid?

923
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,622
Get out of here.
- Arvind, is everything alright?

924
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:36,097
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's go.

925
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,302
Hey, stop. Stop right there.

926
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:45,745
Go upstairs. Go upstairs.
Go upstairs. Run. Run. Run.

927
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,447
Hurry up. Run.

928
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,764
Keep quiet.
- No, get out of here.

929
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:07,092
Keep quiet.
- Get out of here.

930
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:08,494
I said, get out.

931
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,597
Come on, kick the door.
Kick the door.

932
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,836
I'm standing right outside the lodge
where the gun fight took place.

933
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,707
The two kenyan
nationals omar and tofeeq...

934
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:42,750
...had entered the
country a month ago...

935
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,513
...to deliver a heavy
consignment of cocaine.

936
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:47,146
Both of them were being
haboured by an indian family...

937
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,282
...kadija and mustaq ansari,
who have just been arrested.

938
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:53,824
Also found dead on the spot was
germany tourist claudia jones...

939
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:55,687
...who was reported
missing by german embassy...

940
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,322
...around four weeks ago.

941
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:01,100
Her cause of death has been
confirmed as a overdose of cocaine.

942
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:04,469
Sir, it's like you go for a
prayer and you end up fasting.

943
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:06,700
Your mumbai police was
looking for amrita jaishankar...

944
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:09,710
...but it got a germany
citizen missing since four weeks...

945
01:19:09,744 --> 01:19:12,076
...claudia's dead body.

946
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:13,341
What do you have to say about this?

947
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,849
Excuse me. What do you think?

948
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,618
That police handles
only one case at a time?

949
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,417
For us, each and
every case is important.

950
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:23,719
If we have amrita's
case it doesn't mean...

951
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,317
...that we ignore claudia's case.

952
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:29,259
Please. Our experts' team has
been investigating this case...

953
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,390
for the past four weeks.

954
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:34,799
And what is so surprising
if we find claudia jones?

955
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,134
I am surprised at your behaviour.

956
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:40,470
You are looking for drama even
when the police has done good work.

957
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,506
Saw how the
commissioner is fooling people?

958
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,706
So what?
- What did the doctor say?

959
01:19:46,781 --> 01:19:48,305
I've already been shot thrice.

960
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:49,680
Doctor said if i get shot again...

961
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:50,775
...there will be no blood
left in my body.

962
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,444
Sir, where is amrita?

963
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:55,714
Doctor said that?

964
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,717
Sandeep, crabs don't
have any blood in them...

965
01:19:58,793 --> 01:20:00,260
...and cops don't have
a single loyal bone.

966
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,454
Now what you think is what you are.

967
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,489
Did you find anything
in the laptop?

968
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,091
No. And nothing in the
facebook account as well.

969
01:20:07,168 --> 01:20:08,567
Except sympathy messages.

970
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,537
About 3000 of them
but nothing suspicious.

971
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:11,697
Anything from the tracking device?

972
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:13,764
I have diverted the phone
calls of all the parents here.

973
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,241
In about 20 minutes i will be
able to crack anyone calling.

974
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,336
Inspector.

975
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,710
And the terrestrial
tracking software which helps in...

976
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:20,839
inspector.

977
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:29,489
Yes, ma'am?
- How old was that girl?

978
01:20:29,557 --> 01:20:31,286
17.

979
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:35,821
Jai...

980
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,699
jai, we have lost her.

981
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:47,141
Jai, what am i going to do?

982
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:21,264
How... all of us kidnapped?

983
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:24,544
I don't understand anything.

984
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:26,240
I also don't understand.

985
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,412
Does the hero love the
milkmaid or the other item girl?

986
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,683
Amy
- can you guys just stop it?

987
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,822
If we don't go home for few hours...

988
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:36,819
...does it mean
that we are kidnapped?

989
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,862
Dash. Dash.

990
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:44,625
What's the plan, now?

991
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:49,296
Kc, your dad can solve this.

992
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:51,299
Let's go back.

993
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:53,367
Go back?

994
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:54,566
Tanya...

995
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:04,043
what do you think? The cops are
doing a striptease in the station?

996
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,048
If we go back, they will
badger each one of us...

997
01:22:09,124 --> 01:22:11,422
...where we were and
what were we doing.

998
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:16,096
One wrong answer and you
will be thrashed in such a way...

999
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,392
...that you will never forget.

1000
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:21,258
We don't have the
money and on top of that...

1001
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,065
...malwankar is
sitting over our heads.

1002
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,104
We will call
everyone's dads tonight.

1003
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:31,076
And decide the drop off point.
- Okay.

1004
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,268
Why everyone's dads?

1005
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,076
Why not ask when we
have the opportunity.

1006
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:36,274
According to the media all
four of you got kidnapped, right?

1007
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,483
Then how much money will we get?

1008
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:42,386
Amy.
- What?

1009
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:45,491
25 from your dad.

1010
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,290
We will get 25 from his dad.

1011
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:50,490
10 from zubin's dad.

1012
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:57,434
And from tanya's sister,
perhaps 1500.

1013
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:02,543
All of you wait here.
I'll go and make the calls.

1014
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,077
Wait. I'll come along.

1015
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,238
You stay here. Take care of them.

1016
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,317
Kc.

1017
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:19,451
What's happening?

1018
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,455
Can't you see it?

1019
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:23,058
Don't you understand?

1020
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:24,456
What do you mean?

1021
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:26,056
Dash is a big bullshitter.

1022
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:31,068
You are agreeing to
whatever he is saying.

1023
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:32,197
Nothing like that.

1024
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:33,467
Whose plan it was to
kidnap someone?

1025
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:38,106
And now... he is asking a
ransom from everyone's dads.

1026
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:41,106
And why did he hit him so badly?

1027
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:45,109
Yes. Why did he hit him?

1028
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,182
He should have just
watch me get raped, right?

1029
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:49,122
Just cool it, you know.

1030
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,124
Rape? What rape?

1031
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,224
You both looked like you
were made for each other.

1032
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:55,091
Didn't you see their...

1033
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,557
...chemistry?

1034
01:23:58,633 --> 01:23:59,691
Tanya.
- Tanya.

1035
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,224
Stupid. Listen...
- tanya.

1036
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,035
Zubi, go.

1037
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:09,802
Tanya.

1038
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,411
I'm leaving.
- Look, don't take...

1039
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:19,646
i'm leaving.
- Don't take amy seriously.

1040
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:26,252
Zubi, we... we are all going to die.

1041
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,653
See, i... i know

1042
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,664
i am freaking out, too.

1043
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,256
Everything will be fine.

1044
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:37,199
What will be fine, zubi?

1045
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,263
I was almost raped.

1046
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:41,734
Reped. Zubi.

1047
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:50,282
Two days ago we ran
over and killed two men.

1048
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,013
And in that lodge, that...

1049
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:57,623
we killed that bastard.
- There's no proof.

1050
01:24:57,692 --> 01:24:59,557
I mean like, he
could still be alive.

1051
01:24:59,627 --> 01:25:01,060
What difference does it make?

1052
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,429
What difference does it make?

1053
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:29,449
Please, get me out of here.

1054
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:32,553
Please.

1055
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:36,460
Zubi.

1056
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:39,794
I cannot leave kc.

1057
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:48,070
You love me, right?

1058
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:51,542
Please, get me out of here.

1059
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:55,105
I want to go home, zubi.

1060
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:58,209
I don't want to do this anymore.

1061
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,013
Please zubi.

1062
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:04,083
Take me home. Please.

1063
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:07,788
Please.

1064
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:11,489
I'll...

1065
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,431
...get a cab.

1066
01:26:19,173 --> 01:26:21,164
I'll come with you.

1067
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:25,509
They will suspect us
if we go together.

1068
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:30,307
If they ask, just
make up something, okay?

1069
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:33,149
Say that i have gone to
get food or something.

1070
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:35,589
Okay?
- Okay.

1071
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:41,092
Zubi, i want your phone.
I want to call my sister.

1072
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,154
Please.

1073
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:56,143
Don't worry? We are
doing the right thing.

1074
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:03,343
Now we need 50... not 25 lakhs.

1075
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:06,848
Tomorrow 11:30am sharp.
Outside the goodluck restaurant.

1076
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:08,549
Lower parel.

1077
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:11,319
Come alone. If you bring
the police along then...

1078
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,122
you will get the money.

1079
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:14,525
Balwant, who is the si
of that area?

1080
01:27:14,595 --> 01:27:16,529
Please don't hurt amy.

1081
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:18,494
Can i speak to amy?

1082
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,223
Hello. Hello.

1083
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:21,427
What date is it tomorrow?

1084
01:28:04,645 --> 01:28:05,805
Give me that.

1085
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:09,311
Give it back to me.

1086
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,620
I'll kill you.
- Let me go.

1087
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:18,414
What's going on?

1088
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:19,619
Yes?

1089
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:20,592
What's going on?

1090
01:28:20,661 --> 01:28:21,855
I'll tell you what's going on.

1091
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,154
The bitch was calling the cops.

1092
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:26,098
I was not calling the cops.

1093
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:27,800
Tanya.
- Just stay here.

1094
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,394
I'm not going anywhere.
- You were calling the cops.

1095
01:28:30,438 --> 01:28:32,235
Kc, i didn't call the cops.
- Bitch.

1096
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:33,535
Where did you get the phone?

1097
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:34,734
Who gave you this phone?
- Trust, huh?

1098
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,140
Where's zubin?

1099
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,176
He is out to get food.

1100
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:39,110
Trust? Trust.
- You bitch.

1101
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,340
Trust means shit, doesn't it?
- You bitch.

1102
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:43,316
Who broke our trust?

1103
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,382
Everything has
happened because of you, kc.

1104
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,116
Everything has
happened because of you.

1105
01:29:09,076 --> 01:29:10,202
Tanya, get up.

1106
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:11,370
Amy.

1107
01:29:12,213 --> 01:29:13,202
Tanya.

1108
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:24,681
I hope she...

1109
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,504
kc.

1110
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:47,646
Tanya.

1111
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:57,416
Zubin.

1112
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,183
Zubin.

1113
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:06,454
Which information are you
talking about? - Don't shout, sir.

1114
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:09,189
Of course, i will shout.
- No, you don't have to shout.

1115
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:11,595
Who is he to tell me not to shout?

1116
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:13,293
One by one.

1117
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:15,562
You think your brother
will ever come back?

1118
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,570
Please. Stop it.

1119
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,105
That's enough.

1120
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:20,606
Please, sir.

1121
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,479
Our sources have just informed us...

1122
01:32:01,549 --> 01:32:04,746
tanya sharma has been found.

1123
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:06,616
Tanya sharma has been found.

1124
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,588
Still no news on amrita jaishankar.

1125
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:48,486
Stay here till i don't return.

1126
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:21,585
Where are you?

1127
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:23,755
On second floor in
the opposite building.

1128
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:58,429
Yes, sir, i can see him.

1129
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:23,689
Why did mahabharata take place?

1130
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,259
Because draupadi laughed.

1131
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:28,561
I found this audio
clip in amy's laptop.

1132
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:30,791
It matches with the ransom call.

1133
01:34:31,398 --> 01:34:34,595
I'm 100% sure its dushyant sahu.

1134
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,164
Did our hero come to
pick up the money?

1135
01:34:38,672 --> 01:34:40,367
No

1136
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:42,535
i don't think he will.

1137
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:55,547
Tanya.

1138
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:58,709
Tanya, listen to me.

1139
01:36:16,503 --> 01:36:17,492
Tanu.

1140
01:36:21,809 --> 01:36:23,174
Tanya.

1141
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:28,172
Tanya.

1142
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:31,276
Tanya.

1143
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:43,590
Hello.

1144
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:46,255
Yes.

1145
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:49,296
So?

1146
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:52,831
So what were the others doing?

1147
01:36:53,107 --> 01:36:54,233
Where they busy celebrating
lord krishna's birthday?

1148
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:56,139
Sir, actually...
- just a minute, mathur.

1149
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:57,743
Is this a joke?

1150
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,342
It has been more than 48 hours.
What have we done?

1151
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:02,378
We found that german
girl claudia by fluke.

1152
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:03,814
We had one chance but
we lost that as well.

1153
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:06,848
There's a half dead
girl lying in here...

1154
01:37:07,121 --> 01:37:08,520
...who might die as i speak.

1155
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:09,782
Sir, i know that, but...

1156
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:11,757
you don't know anything, mathur.

1157
01:37:11,825 --> 01:37:13,793
Is the media targeting you?

1158
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:17,561
They have linked everything to this
case from terrorism to black magic.

1159
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:19,258
There is a lot of
pressure on me, mathur.

1160
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,595
I keep getting
calls from my seniors.

1161
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:22,602
I'm repeatedly being told that
they will give the case to cbi...

1162
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,695
sir, i'll talk to you later.
- You...

1163
01:37:27,841 --> 01:37:29,866
sir, we found him
outside the airport.

1164
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:31,702
His father was
sending him to bangalore.

1165
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:34,238
Did he say anything?
- No, sir.

1166
01:37:40,587 --> 01:37:41,884
I want my lawyer.

1167
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:47,160
What did you think you are
sitting in an american prison?

1168
01:37:47,227 --> 01:37:48,489
It's my right.

1169
01:37:48,896 --> 01:37:51,387
Only the police are right
during an interrogation.

1170
01:37:51,465 --> 01:37:54,662
No one will come to know even if
i bump you off in an encounter.

1171
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:55,760
Got it?

1172
01:38:00,441 --> 01:38:03,376
Now tell me, where are
the rest of your friends?

1173
01:38:03,744 --> 01:38:06,144
Otherwise, along with you, your
parents, too, won't get a lawyer.

1174
01:38:07,815 --> 01:38:08,804
Tell me.

1175
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:14,386
Okay, don't tell me.

1176
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:17,647
I'll book you for tanya's murder.

1177
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:21,127
You killed tanya, didn't you?

1178
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:22,594
No, sir. I didn't.

1179
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:24,561
You killed tanya, didn't you?
- No, sir. I didn't.

1180
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:27,690
Never

1181
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:30,496
i had told them i don't
want to be a part of this.

1182
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,297
They...

1183
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:35,539
i got scared, sir.

1184
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:39,176
I got scared.

1185
01:38:40,848 --> 01:38:42,713
Look, you couldn't save tanya.

1186
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:45,747
But you can save yourself trust me.

1187
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:48,377
Trust a cop?

1188
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:52,525
All this has
happened because of a cop.

1189
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:55,758
What do you mean?

1190
01:38:57,164 --> 01:38:58,426
Let us pray.

1191
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,665
Almighty god, whose
blessed son bears our grief...

1192
01:39:02,736 --> 01:39:07,298
...and carries our sorrows,
grant faith and courage...

1193
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:10,639
...to all who are
suffering at this time.

1194
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:12,702
And give your
strength and blessing...

1195
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:15,510
...to those who seek to help them.

1196
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:18,340
Through jesus christ, our lord.

1197
01:39:18,685 --> 01:39:19,743
Amen.

1198
01:39:42,176 --> 01:39:43,234
Amy...

1199
01:39:44,711 --> 01:39:47,509
someone must have taken
her to the hospital, right?

1200
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:52,447
Amy, you think she's okay?

1201
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:56,812
I think i should call her.

1202
01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:01,521
Yes, i'll call her.

1203
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:06,223
No... no one will believe
that it was an accident, kc.

1204
01:40:06,433 --> 01:40:09,129
I know how it works.
That's the way it works.

1205
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:13,235
No one believed my mother either.

1206
01:40:15,142 --> 01:40:16,473
They just locked her up.

1207
01:40:20,147 --> 01:40:21,512
They are going to lock us up, too.

1208
01:40:22,483 --> 01:40:25,816
Once we get the money...
then... then... then...

1209
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:29,246
then we should leave. Yes.
Then we have to get out of here.

1210
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:31,086
We have to leave.

1211
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:33,688
We'll go to la.

1212
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:37,492
For a few days i'll
request them to let my mom out.

1213
01:40:37,564 --> 01:40:38,531
You can meet my mom.

1214
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:42,091
What crap are you ranting?
- Her eyes are so beautiful.

1215
01:40:42,169 --> 01:40:43,602
She paints so well.

1216
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:44,693
You have to see her paintings.
- What happened?

1217
01:40:44,771 --> 01:40:46,102
She's amazing.

1218
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,265
I didn't get the money.
Cops all around.

1219
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:51,541
Dash, don't lie. Where's the money?

1220
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:53,411
Where's the money?

1221
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:58,415
Your dad had made
all the arrangements.

1222
01:40:59,052 --> 01:41:00,519
I would've got caught if i
had gone to take the money.

1223
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:01,815
It would have been better
if you would've got caught.

1224
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:03,113
What?

1225
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:05,517
Move.

1226
01:41:06,527 --> 01:41:07,721
No.
- Where are you going?

1227
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:10,163
I'm hungry. I'm
going to get some food.

1228
01:41:14,768 --> 01:41:16,827
From our department?
- Yes, sir.

1229
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:19,071
Zubin is telling the truth.

1230
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:21,767
All rascals cooking up a story.

1231
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:25,478
It's part of the plan blame a cop.

1232
01:41:25,546 --> 01:41:28,515
Mathur, i am not getting emotional...

1233
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:31,244
...because malwankar or
whoever he is, is a cop.

1234
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:34,651
While sitting here, i know
whose uniform gets ironed where.

1235
01:41:35,122 --> 01:41:36,612
Please, sir. Listen to me.
- Mathur.

1236
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:38,282
Enough is enough.

1237
01:41:38,358 --> 01:41:39,382
Enough is enough indeed.

1238
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:42,721
You solve this case and
get yourself transferred.

1239
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:44,525
Listening to a kid
you are acting insane...

1240
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:47,123
i'ts not nonsense im not
getting instigated by a kid, sir.

1241
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:49,593
I've been trying to tell you
since long you are not getting me.

1242
01:41:49,803 --> 01:41:51,270
I've done my background check, sir.

1243
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:53,672
Sorry won't be able to do this.

1244
01:41:54,474 --> 01:41:57,602
Sir. Sir, pratham has called in.

1245
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:58,736
The phone number given by
zubin shroff belongs...

1246
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:00,370
...to some gauri malwankar.

1247
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:06,519
Patel, keep in mind that
he shouldn't find out...

1248
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:07,645
...that we know about him.
- Swine.

1249
01:42:07,721 --> 01:42:09,052
No one will send a
message to the wireless.

1250
01:42:09,089 --> 01:42:10,818
I've already given a
message to the wireless.

1251
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:12,116
With whose permission?

1252
01:42:12,192 --> 01:42:13,625
With whose... sorry.

1253
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:17,525
Sandeep, let's go.

1254
01:42:18,532 --> 01:42:19,624
Let's go.

1255
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:32,101
Gopi must be on his
way back from school.

1256
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:34,342
Where are you going?

1257
01:42:34,414 --> 01:42:36,177
Have your lunch.
I'll be back in an hour.

1258
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,547
Gauri malwankar?
- Okay?

1259
01:42:42,356 --> 01:42:43,550
Shut up.

1260
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:48,351
I said shut up. He
shouldn't find out.

1261
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:10,113
Where were you?

1262
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:39,839
Move aside. Move aside.

1263
01:43:40,213 --> 01:43:41,441
Move aside. Move aside.

1264
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:55,460
Move aside. Move aside.

1265
01:44:23,190 --> 01:44:26,216
Check there. Down there.
- Hail lord ganesha.

1266
01:46:08,094 --> 01:46:09,721
Forget it.
- Sion. Sion. Sion hospital.

1267
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:13,090
The car has reached dadar...
- 1100. - tell me.

1268
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:14,599
Send the car.

Yes, tell me.
- 400. - send the car.

1270
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:19,464

1271
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:20,699

Sion hospital. - Tell me. - 3588.
It's an airtel connection.

1273
01:46:25,612 --> 01:46:27,409
They... they... hurry up.

1274
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:30,044
It's an airtel connection.

1275
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,484
Yes.
- Okay.

1276
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:35,112
Arvind, nandini had come to my
clinic. She's had a small accident.

1277
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:36,587
Hurry up. Hurry up.
- What?

1278
01:46:36,656 --> 01:46:39,181
There is a fracture,
but it's nothing serious.

1279
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:41,227
Don't worry. Listen,
arvind. Listen to me. Arvind...

1280
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:44,256
what is it?
- Stop.

1281
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:45,429
What happened?

1282
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:46,397
You handle this.

1283
01:46:47,601 --> 01:46:49,193
Where are you going?

1284
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:51,534
Arvind.

1285
01:47:09,389 --> 01:47:10,617
Why have you come here?

1286
01:47:13,159 --> 01:47:14,751
To meet my wife.

1287
01:48:10,817 --> 01:48:11,806
Yes, tell me.

1288
01:48:13,219 --> 01:48:14,243
What?

1289
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:16,415
Any other information?

1290
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:31,662
We are already very disturbed.

1291
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:33,228
We are worried for our son.

1292
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:35,774
Please go away.

1293
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:38,834
Watchman. Watchman.
Take them out of here.

1294
01:48:39,112 --> 01:48:40,739
Giving us a lot of trouble.

1295
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:46,251
You have a phone in here?

1296
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:48,481
The news is confirmed.

1297
01:48:48,788 --> 01:48:51,882
Malwankar last called from
a public booth in vasai.

1298
01:48:52,525 --> 01:48:55,358
And karan chaudhary
just called his father...

1299
01:48:55,428 --> 01:48:56,725
asked him to come to
a church in vasai.

1300
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:58,093
Any contact from his dad?

1301
01:48:58,164 --> 01:48:59,563
No, his phone is off.

1302
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,559
Leave. I'll meet you in vasai.

1303
01:49:02,636 --> 01:49:04,160
Vasai.
- I won't go to vasai, sir.

1304
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:05,404
Ofcourse you will.

1305
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:45,375
No!

1306
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:48,306
Mom! Mom!

1307
01:49:48,715 --> 01:49:52,412
Mom!
- Amy. Look at me.

1308
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:56,114
I have to go get mom.
- Amy.

1309
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:58,282
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1310
01:49:58,358 --> 01:49:59,620
Where's the money?
Give me the money.

1311
01:49:59,726 --> 01:50:01,353
I'll give you back
the money. Please.

1312
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:03,453
I just need the money
right now. I need mom.

1313
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:08,058
Please. No. Where

01:50:08,134 --> 01:50:10,193
Dash. I want the money.

01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:13,133

Dash, please, i need the money.

I need the...

1320
01:50:24,617 --> 01:50:26,278
Kc. Kc.

1321
01:50:26,352 --> 01:50:28,149
Amy, come, let's go from here.
- Kc, have you got the money?

1322
01:50:28,221 --> 01:50:30,280
Where were you?
- Come on, amy, let's go home.

1323
01:50:30,356 --> 01:50:31,755
Home? Where's the money?

1324
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:33,156
Where were you?
- Amy... amy...

1325
01:50:33,226 --> 01:50:34,352
i don't want to go home.
- Amy... - where were you?

1326
01:50:34,427 --> 01:50:36,657
I have called my dad. I
have called my dad. - No.

1327
01:50:36,763 --> 01:50:38,253
He must be on his way
to pick us up. Come on.

1328
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:39,662
You called him?
- No...

1329
01:50:39,799 --> 01:50:41,323
amy, please. Come on, amy.
- I don't...

1330
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:42,561
with whose
permission did you call him?

1331
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:45,865
Do i need your
permission to call my dad?

1332
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:47,299
Amy. Amy, come on, let's go.

1333
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,637
We were deciding
everything together, right?

1334
01:50:48,842 --> 01:50:51,106
What happened now?
- Now i have decided.

1335
01:50:51,177 --> 01:50:53,111
Amy let's go.

1336
01:50:53,246 --> 01:50:54,372
No one will go anywhere.

1337
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:57,215
Malwankar is not
answering his phone.

1338
01:50:58,651 --> 01:51:00,346
Enough of planning.

1339
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:02,754
Until now it was
all your plan, right?

1340
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:04,312
Is it working?

1341
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:07,718
Whose plan was it
to kidnap oneself?

1342
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:11,323
Whose plan was it to
hide in bhindi bazaar?

1343
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:13,322
Whose plan was it to come here?

1344
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:15,165
Amy, come on, let's go. Please.

1345
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:17,066
Dash. Dash. Dash.

1346
01:51:17,137 --> 01:51:19,332
We can fix this, okay? I
know my dad. He loves me.

1347
01:51:19,405 --> 01:51:20,599
He loves me a lot, okay?

1348
01:51:20,673 --> 01:51:22,300
He must have paid up

1349
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:24,334
where have you hidden it?

1350
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:26,776
Where have you hidden it?
- Just shut up, amy.

1351
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:30,808
Your dad hates you, okay?

1352
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:36,311
Had he loved you he
would've quietly paid the money.

1353
01:51:41,327 --> 01:51:42,351
And you...

1354
01:51:42,796 --> 01:51:45,458
you can leave if you want to.
She won't go anywhere.

1355
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:50,100
Come on, amy.

1356
01:51:57,377 --> 01:51:58,708
You will hit me?

1357
01:51:59,712 --> 01:52:00,736
Come on, amy.
- No.

1358
01:52:00,814 --> 01:52:03,112
Let's go, amy.
Let's get out of here.

1359
01:52:34,614 --> 01:52:36,514
It was my plan. My plan.

1360
01:53:07,647 --> 01:53:11,048
Who is in there? Open
the door! Open the door!

1361
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:20,454
People have gathered outside.
Come with me.

1362
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:22,218
I have to go and get mom.

1363
01:53:24,364 --> 01:53:26,525
Amy, come with me.
- I have to get mom.

1364
01:53:30,336 --> 01:53:32,770
Amy.
- I have to go and get mom.

1365
01:53:32,839 --> 01:53:35,740
Your mother is dead. Do
you wish to die as well?

1366
01:53:35,808 --> 01:53:37,241
Come with me. Just get up.

1367
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,108
No! She's not dead!
- Shut up.

1368
01:54:05,104 --> 01:54:06,765
Who is in there?

1369
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:08,601
Come on, run.

1370
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:10,232
Move.

1371
01:56:18,204 --> 01:56:20,138
Amrita jaishankar has been found.

1372
01:56:20,206 --> 01:56:24,199
The kidnappers of this
high profile kidnapping case...

1373
01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:27,144
...finally lost their
lives at god's abode.

1374
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:31,139
Amrita bravely fought
with her kidnappers.

1375
01:56:31,217 --> 01:56:33,708
After a 48 hour ordeal

1376
01:56:33,786 --> 01:56:36,084
...the girl is now
safe with her parents.

1377
01:56:36,155 --> 01:56:39,784
Mathur, there is a difference
between the fact and the truth.

1378
01:56:41,794 --> 01:56:47,357
Mathur, the truth is its
the duty of every cop...

1379
01:56:47,433 --> 01:56:49,799
...to selflessly serve his nation.

1380
01:56:51,504 --> 01:56:55,440
But the fact remains
in a salary of 8500...

1381
01:56:56,576 --> 01:56:59,773
...he has to look after his family,
serve his nation...

1382
01:57:02,248 --> 01:57:08,619
...and be loyal,
selflessness goes for a toss.

1383
01:57:12,558 --> 01:57:18,656
One person is
responsible for all this.

1384
01:57:19,398 --> 01:57:20,831
Malwankar.

1385
01:57:21,367 --> 01:57:22,732
It's true.

1386
01:57:23,402 --> 01:57:27,805
But the fact is to save the
face of the entire police force...

1387
01:57:29,742 --> 01:57:33,303
...this case has to be suppressed.

1388
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,175
You've to decide...

1389
01:57:36,883 --> 01:57:42,378
...whether you will
go with truth or fact.

1390
01:57:53,799 --> 01:57:56,063
Amrita fought bravely
with her kidnappers...

1391
01:57:56,135 --> 01:57:58,399
...and just about managed to escape.

1392
01:57:58,604 --> 01:58:00,834
The other victims tanya
sharma and zubin shroff...

1393
01:58:01,107 --> 01:58:02,734
...are also in safe custody now.

1394
01:58:03,242 --> 01:58:04,539
While it was earlier reported that...

1395
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:06,475
...one of her friends
dushant sahu might have been...

1396
01:58:06,546 --> 01:58:07,570
...involved in the kidnapping.

1397
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:09,410
At this point we
cannot confirm this.

1398
01:58:09,482 --> 01:58:11,109
I, tanya sharma... i, zubin shroff...

1399
01:58:11,184 --> 01:58:14,381
in my sound mind, and
without any pressure from anyone...

1400
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:17,753
...accept that we were not a part
of amrita jaishankar's kidnapping.

1401
01:58:18,391 --> 01:58:21,451
Like us, karan chaudhary
and amrita jaishankar, too...

1402
01:58:21,527 --> 01:58:23,188
...became victims of this conspiracy.

1403
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:27,661
This entire incident was
planned by dushyant sahu.

1404
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:31,634
Wherever possible we tried our
best to stop our friend dusyhant.

1405
01:58:32,538 --> 01:58:35,200
All four of us claim to be
innocent in this incident.

1406
01:58:35,274 --> 01:58:38,107
Yours' sincerely, tanya.

1407
01:58:45,518 --> 01:58:48,180
Operation 'amrita
missing' has coming to an end.

1408
01:58:48,588 --> 01:58:51,284
During this case
inspector malwankar...

1409
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:53,790
...who was investigating this case...

1410
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:55,755
...has been seriously injured.

1411
01:58:56,562 --> 01:58:57,790
Malwankar...

1412
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:07,066
look carefully at this bed,
this wall and this ward.

1413
01:59:09,141 --> 01:59:11,837
Because you will be
coming back here, soon.

1414
01:59:12,678 --> 01:59:14,441
Not because of what you have done.

1415
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:18,340
But because i won't let
the years of hard work...

1416
01:59:18,417 --> 01:59:20,180
...of the police
force go down the drain.

1417
01:59:20,253 --> 01:59:22,278
I'm sorry, sir.

1418
01:59:22,855 --> 01:59:24,413
Sir. Sir...

1419
01:59:24,624 --> 01:59:25,682
sir...

1420
01:59:26,392 --> 01:59:27,552
i am...

1421
01:59:41,674 --> 01:59:44,507
mathur. Thanks a lot.

1422
01:59:48,147 --> 01:59:49,341
Thanks.

1423
02:02:41,187 --> 02:02:43,087
What is your name, my child?

1424
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:47,651
Saira.

1425
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:51,158
Amy.

1426
02:02:53,265 --> 02:02:54,755
Saira jaishankar.
