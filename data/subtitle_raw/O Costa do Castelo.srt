O COSTA DO CASTELO
(The Costa from Castelo)

2
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:37,635
Based on the play
with the same original name by

3
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:24,318
Production

4
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:16,469
The moon fades, day breaks

5
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:20,316
And the street comes to life
to the sound of the reveille

6
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:24,070
Throughout the blue sky
A flock of larks fly by

7
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:27,631
Happily singing good morning

8
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,835
Smoke drifts from rooftops
The markets are opening

9
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:35,471
To the calls of the fish sellers

10
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:39,550
The town shouts, bubbles and throbs

11
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:43,350
On its seven hills

12
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,156
And from a beautiful dream,
Idle and smiling

13
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:50,996
From the Castle to Madragoa

14
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:54,710
Sweet and beautiful, at each window

15
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:58,669
Lisbon awakes smiling

16
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:02,680
Mermaids echoes
Cross the air

17
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:06,391
And from the beehives
All is put to flight

18
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,792
The morning sun sings in splendour

19
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:13,197
An anthem of peace and love

20
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:17,989
A fighting cock sings from its perch

21
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,517
Challenging its rivals

22
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,710
Horns are heard,
Newsagents walk by

23
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,556
- Weighed down by newspapers...
- Milk!

24
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:33,436
And from a beautiful dream,
Idle and smiling

25
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:36,991
From the Castle to Madragoa

26
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:41,156
Sweet and beautiful, at each window

27
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,950
Lisbon awakes smiling

28
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,481
- Good morning, Ms. Rita.
- Good morning, Conceição.

29
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:59,353
- It seems you put water in the milk.
- Water?! God forbid!

30
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:02,160
At two thousand 'reis' a metre...

31
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,073
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, see you tomorrow.

32
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:14,114
Luisinha! Hurry up!
It's past nine thirty!

33
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,317
- I'm coming!
- Nine thirty five.

34
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,357
- Good morning!
- Good morning, Luisinha.

35
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,075
- Good morning, Ma Rita.
- Good morning.

36
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,476
- Has it got sugar?
- Yes.

37
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:33,351
- Sit down, girl.
- It goes down better like this.

38
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:36,160
- What about your toast?
- Leave it for later.

39
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,192
- And the morning snack?
- Save it for lunch,

40
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,835
starvation keeps you slim.
- Come here!

41
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,599
See you later!

42
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:54,034
- She's off on a drop of coffee.
- It's a good job coffee

43
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,994
is made of beans,
because beans are nourishing.

44
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,793
See you later!

45
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:02,834
And off she goes,
as light as if she's had lunch.

46
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,636
Rita, isn't this Luisa's briefcase?

47
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:09,436
- Dear God, yes it is!
- Hell! Call her back!

48
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,829
- Luisinha! Luisinha!
- See what hurrying does?

49
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,637
- She's gone.
- What now?

50
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:19,719
I don't know!
Of course, there goes Mr. Costa.

51
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,870
Mr. Costa, come here quickly!

52
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:27,472
What's wrong? Where's the fire?

53
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:31,873
- She's left her bag. Her briefcase!
- Her "brief-bag"?

54
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,919
<i>- "Suitcase", you mean.
- No. That's not it!

55
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,994
Luisa's left her briefcase behind.
If you could kindly take it to her...

56
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:40,719
- Me?
- Yes! You'll get there in no time!

57
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:44,712
The bank's briefcase! Let me see!

58
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,709
My hat! Hell...

59
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:53,318
- But you won't catch her.
- You can bet people will give way

60
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:57,872
when they see Costa running
with this briefcase. Shift, Januário!

61
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:37,675
Luisinha!

62
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,156
Luisinha!

63
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:46,480
What's wrong, Mr. Costa?
Has anything happened?

64
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:50,480
No. But it could have.
Aren't you missing anything?

65
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,434
- No, nothing.
- Who lost what I've found...

66
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,071
- Ah, my briefcase!
- What an empty head!

67
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:00,432
- But for me... Who's a friend, then?
- Thank you, Mr. Costa,

68
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,320
you came running for me.
- Not running, flying!

69
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:05,676
If it hadn't been for the runway,
which is not to be trusted,

70
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,833
I'd have caught up with you before.
- Another reason to thank you.

71
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:12,880
You're the boss, Luisinha.
As the poet says, he who cannot buy,

72
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:16,397
is happy to serve.
- Well, I'll listen to the rest later,

73
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,479
- I haven't got time now. Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

74
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,557
Serving makes one happy...

75
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,712
Sure, sure...

76
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:32,718
No health is better than a little.

77
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:09,355
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Luisinha.

78
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:16,230
Can you tell me who the little beauty
is who's just come in?

79
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,676
That's Miss Luisinha,
the manager's secretary.

80
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,473
- What time does she leave the bank?
- At six.

81
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,795
Thanks.

82
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:30,637
Januário, add up the tenants' money.

83
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:35,910
400 'escudos' from Luisinha,
450 from Mr. Costa, isn't it?

84
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:39,831
Yes. When he does pay, it's 450.

85
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:48,398
Well, that's 850 escudos.
If we rent this room for 500,

86
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,992
plus your pension off the Town Hall,
we'll be alright!

87
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:55,551
- Ah, here you are!
- Did you find Luisinha?

88
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:58,479
- Yes, but I really had to run.
- Well, then...

89
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,956
This is what happens when I go out,
I've worked like mad.

90
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,238
- You've worked?
- It's not Fool's Day, Mr. Costa.

91
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:06,238
Honestly.
I went to see Marcolina's dog

92
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:08,312
and the scamp, who's got mange,
has got a twisted knee.

93
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:12,559
- Mange? Poor woman.
- Not the woman, the dog!

94
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,359
Then I went off to repair
the clock at the chemist's.

95
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,636
It really needed it.

96
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:18,081
Yes, it did. At ten o'clock it
showed eight and it was 12:45.

97
00:09:18,081 --> 00:09:19,400
- And now?
- Now it's a lot better.

98
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:22,558
when it's 00.00 hours, it doesn't
show anything and it's seven thirty.

99
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:24,273
- So what?
- All I can say is

100
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:27,040
hadn't I entered the Coal Merchant's
pub for some "carburettor",

101
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:28,594
I wouldn't be here now.

102
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,834
I wish I was always in such
a good mood, Mr. Costa.

103
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,189
Well, Mrs. Rita,

104
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:38,599
I have more reasons
to cry than to laugh.

105
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,719
I was everything in life.

106
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:45,479
I was at the top and toppled.
I saw the seven corners of the world

107
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:48,036
and all because of a woman.

108
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:52,271
- It's everyone's Fado (destiny).
- Ah, speaking of Fado!

109
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,750
Rosa Maria
is in your room waiting.

110
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,913
Oh, right!
The guitar and Fado lesson.

111
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:02,040
I'd forgotten. I have no peace!
Even Rosa Maria!

112
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,510
Even Rosa Maria...

113
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:16,113
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Costa.

114
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:19,751
- I didn't think you were coming.
- You didn't show up yesterday either

115
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:23,112
Well, I wasn't sittin' at the <i>"winda".</i>
I was workin' all <i>mornin'.</i>

116
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:26,039
I put ten pairs of shoes together
and took work to the warehouse.

117
00:10:26,201 --> 00:10:29,432
You'll spoil your hands like that.
How will you play the guitar?

118
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:33,315
But when I 'is' a singer,
I'll quit the job.

119
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:36,319
Quit the job,
and drop the slang.

120
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:40,559
You don't say "I <i>is".</i> It's "I <i>am".</i>

121
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,676
- It's not <i>'aisy'.</i>
<i>- "Easy".

122
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,951
<i>- "Dafficult".
- Another one!

123
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,558
Not that either? Well, if it's gonna be
like that, I dunno how to talk!

124
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,673
How will you sing Fado in public
making such mistakes?

125
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:57,397
When I got to the "winda",
"I is gonna go to the <i>warhouse"...</i>

126
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:01,157
What a "zaggeration"!
I don't sing with that hoarse voice!

127
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:04,717
It's not the voice, it's the lyrics!
Do you know what being a singer is?

128
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,196
'Course I do.
Listen, Alzira had a baby boy.

129
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:09,716
- What's that got to do with it?
- She married a "pharmist"!

130
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:14,318
- And I already have my <i>"indeal".</i>
<i>- "Indeal"? So, he's from India?

131
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:17,559
- It seems he's from the <i>"Ilentejo".</i>
- Is he rich?

132
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,798
- He bought the dining-room furniture.
- You've reached the dining-room?

133
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:23,071
- Don't go any further!
- No, sir. This is serious.

134
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:25,317
Well... Let's get on with the lesson.

135
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,079
Hand on your waist.

136
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,919
Head up.

137
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,874
- A smile.
- Like this?

138
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,556
You'll get a chair thrown at you,
like that. A natural air, girl!

139
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,315
What 'natral' air?
You're talkin' gibberish!

140
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:44,679
Put on the air God gave you.
Sing 'Fado da <i>Saudade'.</i>

141
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,234
Let's see if I can <i>"member".</i>

142
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,556
Go away, sad <i>"fou"...</i>

143
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:56,629
<i>- "Fou" what?
<i>..."Fought"...</i>

144
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,719
Never mind, carry on!
Again.

145
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:07,675
Go away, sad "fought",

146
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,238
What takes me "breaf" away

147
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,751
Ya've been treatin' me...

148
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:20,479
Me fever, me torment,

149
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:23,918
Escape on the <i>"wingués" o'</i> the wind,

150
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:27,596
Escapes on the "wettas" of a <i>"say"...</i>

151
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,039
See what happens? Even the cat runs
off on the "wingués" of the wind!

152
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,717
- Hello!
- Hello!

153
00:12:57,321 --> 00:13:00,154
I'm not mistaken.
What are you doing here?

154
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,519
- It's a secret for the time being.
- Oh, is it? Where have you been?

155
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,831
I've been very busy, you know.
You can't imagine.

156
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:10,073
- Business, I understand...
- Yes. Look, now for example...

157
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:12,954
I know, I know.
And that's in that building alone.

158
00:13:13,081 --> 00:13:15,879
That depends. I'll tell you later.

159
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:19,556
Mind what you're getting into!
You're being watched.

160
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:56,356
STOP

161
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,720
Won't you give me the pleasure
of taking you home?

162
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:13,270
You look like you live far away.

163
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,118
Where is it?
I live in the same direction.

164
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:21,154
Well, then? Seize the opportunity.

165
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,032
- Here's the key.
- Very well.

166
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:32,839
As you can see,
the house is very quiet.

167
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:35,595
Quiet and clean.
No rats, nor cockroaches...

168
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:38,480
And the last instalment
on the furniture has been paid.

169
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:41,553
- Aren't there any more tenants?
- No. I mean, there's a young girl

170
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,552
who's like a daughter to us.
- Luisinha.

171
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:45,916
- Ah, yes.
- And a bloke. But in reality,

172
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,197
it's as if he is part of the family.
- Is he young or old?

173
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,238
- Good morning!
- Speak of the devil...

174
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,392
Were you gossiping about me?
Carry on!

175
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:56,315
- It's this gentleman who's just...
- Say no more, I've sussed him out.

176
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,880
- You're the new tenant.
- You've guessed.

177
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,556
I'm a physiognomist. You look like
a tenant. Let me introduce myself,

178
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:03,996
Simplício Costa, better known
as "Costa do <i>Castelo".</i>

179
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,721
- Pleasure. Daniel Silva, chauffeur.
- In the Square?

180
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,917
No, my car...

181
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,549
...I drive my boss's car.
- Ah, I get it. Rich folk.

182
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,040
- Someone important.
- Precisely.

183
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:17,114
- Excellent! That's another story!
- Don't you get bed and board?

184
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:18,873
- He's tight-fisted.
- Yes, he's tight-fisted...

185
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,396
But to make up for it,
he gives you money to squander.

186
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:24,029
- Do you smoke?
- Yes, but not right now, thanks.

187
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:26,510
No, that's not it,
I haven't got any cigarettes.

188
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:32,229
- Here you are.
- Ah, these are good.

189
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,511
They're the boss's, aren't they?

190
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:43,472
- Oh, Jesus...
- Thanks.

191
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:47,236
- Does your boss use matches, too?
- Yes, but I prefer this.

192
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:49,039
Ah, I see...

193
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:52,921
- Free petrol.
- Of course.

194
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,471
I have a feeling
we're going to get on very well.

195
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,359
I hope so.

196
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:02,030
You'll like it here.
The air itself...

197
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:05,398
Have you seen the view?
Come and look out of your window.

198
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,071
There's the castle. There's the river.
On this side is 'Paço Square',

199
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,358
over there 'Trigo <i>Square'.</i>
There are Squares everywhere.

200
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:21,953
And on the other side... Of course
the other side is... the other side!

201
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:24,559
What do you think?

202
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,159
Superb!

203
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:30,119
- I had no idea.
- Look at the trees.

204
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,830
This is where Estoril should be,
but everything's always wrong.

205
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,639
- You're right.
- Mr. Daniel,

206
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,952
come and drink to your health.
- Thank you, but I don't drink.

207
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:41,271
Don't be shy.
We're all family.

208
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:43,750
- Go on, just a drink to warm up.
- It would make me ill now. Thanks.

209
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,550
- What a shame.
- I'll make the sacrifice then!

210
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:51,430
- Here's to us.
- Thank you. If you'll excuse me,

211
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:55,389
I have to take care of some business,
I'll be back later with my cases.

212
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,677
- Of course, whenever you want.
- We'll be here.

213
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:00,355
In that case, I'll go with Daniel.
I have business to attend to,

214
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:02,989
and you can take me by car.
- Of course, it would be my pleasure,

215
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:05,391
but I can't take you
because I didn't bring the car.

216
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:08,917
You didn't?
Well, in that case... I'll walk you!

217
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:10,878
- Fine.
- See you later.

218
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,235
See you later!

219
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:17,314
- After you.
- Thank you.

220
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:23,440
- Daniel, you must earn quite well.
- Not bad.

221
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,991
- And you must have some savings.
- Yes, I don't spend all my earnings.

222
00:18:27,161 --> 00:18:29,959
Does my dear friend want to make
an absolutely trustworthy deal?

223
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,191
- Me?
- We could form a partnership.

224
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,875
You, my friend,
could come in with... 5000 escudos.

225
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,635
And I'd come in
to the office at ten o'clock.

226
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:41,510
I'm not in business.
I like to get all or nothing.

227
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:43,956
Nothing? We can arrange that, too!

228
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:46,157
No money can pay
for a good thrill.

229
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:47,720
I agree.

230
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,314
- Let's not go that way.
- Why not?

231
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:52,234
I have a bill at the "Coal <i>Merchant's".</i>
He also says there's not enough dough

232
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:55,120
to cover the wine I drink there.
- Let's go that way then.

233
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:57,920
I can't, there's the haberdasher.
I owe her three ounces.

234
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:00,276
And she's worse than a tiger!

235
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:03,871
One day you'll have to come home
by car!

236
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,113
What?! It'll have to be an aeroplane
so they can't see it's me!

237
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:12,154
- What is it? Another one?
- Excuse me, I'm going over there.

238
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:16,356
- Are you going to pawn something?
- No, I'm carrying out a mission.

239
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:18,432
- You'll soon know.
- See you later then.

240
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,911
See you later, Danny boy.
Din-din's at seven!

241
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,679
- Good morning, Mr. Jacob.
- Good morning.

242
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:40,915
- Good morning, Mr. Jacob.
- Good morning. You? Here?!

243
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:44,676
- Another con?
- Conman, me?

244
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:49,314
Yes! Have you forgotten
the last one you did on me?

245
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:53,311
- The last one... no.
- The last one!

246
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,756
Because you won't con me again.

247
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:59,834
You pawned a trombone here
for 20 escudos and it doesn't play.

248
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:04,392
How can you expect a trombone to play
for that price? Not even a whistle!

249
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:08,679
- A note at least. Which one?
- The last one was 20 escudos,

250
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,480
but it's gone!
But this is something else now.

251
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:15,429
- How much is the wireless, then?
- Enough messing around!

252
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:18,150
No credit here,
not even a wire.

253
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:21,393
But the wireless hasn't got a wire.
I mean, I'm paying for it.

254
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:25,315
That there costs 300 escudos!

255
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:28,029
- Cash?
- Of course, cash.

256
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:31,398
- Here we don't sell by instalments.
- You should.

257
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:33,916
You could let me have it for 400...

258
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:38,074
I'd give you 20 escudos,
every other week.

259
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:42,873
The week I should pay, and don't,
would be paid the week I don't.

260
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,039
- Yes?
- No.

261
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:48,113
- Ok, then I'll take it to try it out.
- Try it out?

262
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:51,751
You know... the American way...
You're a well turned out man,

263
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:54,435
with a modern, well-known
establishment

264
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,877
- very well-known! -
you have to keep up with progress.

265
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:02,640
Nowadays everything is tried out.
Pianos, radios,

266
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,951
even crockery and women.
- Uh?!

267
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:07,078
And "linen"!

268
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:10,110
We try it out.
If we like it, we buy it,

269
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:14,194
if not, we send back.
It's the American way, sir.

270
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:18,513
Look here. Do you think
I have a "D" on my forehead?

271
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:21,241
If you do, I can't see it,
maybe if you take your hat off...

272
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:25,031
That's it!
You're taking nothing without cash!

273
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,840
Cash? If that's the case...

274
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,594
I'll get it.
See you, Jacob.

275
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:42,235
- You lost because you wanted to.
- I didn't lose!

276
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,711
- Be quiet, mind the tenant!
- Oh, yes! Shhh!

277
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,837
- What do you mean 'Shhh'?!
- Is he still asleep?

278
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:50,310
The heck he is! He's wide-awake!
Buddy Silva!

279
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:52,199
I'm coming, buddy Costa!

280
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:55,793
- You'll see him, he's very nice.
- Is the cup clean?

281
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,758
- As if!
- Excuse me.

282
00:21:57,921 --> 00:21:59,320
Stop it.

283
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:00,960
Now it's clean!

284
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:04,472
- A very good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Daniel.

285
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,155
- So, did you sleep well?
- Like a log!

286
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:09,676
Mr. Daniel da Silva,
this is our Luisinha.

287
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:11,354
Pleased to meet you.

288
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:16,032
The pleasure is all mine. It's said
you're the light and joy of the house.

289
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,432
- As you can see, they exaggerate.
- And, may I add, the light

290
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:22,559
and joy of the neighbourhood.
- Well done, Mr. Poet Chauffeur!

291
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:25,474
- For God's sake, you're very kind.
- Spare me the 'madrugals'

292
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,792
and let's have coffee.
- You don't say "madrugals",

293
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:33,671
it's <i>"madri",</i> "madrigals".
<i>- "Madri"? Are you madrigal or matinal?

294
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:36,561
Neither one nor the other,
I like getting up late!

295
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:40,958
- What time does the bank open?
- At ten sharp.

296
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,237
But in a few days,
I'll be enjoying my holiday.

297
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:46,154
- Splendid! Are you staying at home?
- No, I plan to go away,

298
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:49,119
to a friend's on the Costa do Sol.
- Yes?

299
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:52,631
In a sanatorium like this,
with light everywhere,

300
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:55,474
fresh air, water on tap...

301
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,359
She's going to a beach!

302
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:00,718
I prefer Costa do Castelo
to Costa do Sol.

303
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,190
- Well said!
- Why? Do you think so, Mr Daniel?

304
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:04,316
Yes.

305
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:07,791
I've only just arrived, and already
I'm losing your delightful company.

306
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,317
- Well, let's go.
- So early?

307
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:14,679
Early? I'm going to be late!
Bye, Ma Rita! Bye, Pa Januário!

308
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:16,718
- Mr. Costa...
- Don't forget your briefcase!

309
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:18,837
Ok, don't worry!

310
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,755
Mr. Januário,
give me a word rhyming with morning.

311
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,752
I've been thinking and thinking
and I can't find one.

312
00:23:31,921 --> 00:23:34,799
I also make up the verses
for the Fados now, do I?

313
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,031
Don't I help you cut paper
for the windmills?

314
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,999
Don't mind my asking...
But, is it worthwhile?

315
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:43,233
What do you mean?! In a month
I can sell about six dozen, or so.

316
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:44,516
- Is that all?
- To tell you the truth,

317
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:48,879
the biggest profit is Luisinha's.
- Luisinha... A charming girl.

318
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,350
She's as good as an angel.

319
00:23:53,161 --> 00:23:56,153
I can still see her
the day she came in...

320
00:23:56,321 --> 00:23:58,152
It's nearly three years.

321
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:01,951
Her grandmother had died,
she was her only relative.

322
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:05,678
And she asked me to take her in
while she looked for a job.

323
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,752
- Doesn't she have anyone else?
- No, sir.

324
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,957
- They already knew each other.
- I was her nursemaid.

325
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:12,032
- I nursed her at my breast.
- Oh, yes?

326
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:16,672
This young girl is very well born
and her education was excellent.

327
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:18,832
She can speak French, English...

328
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,795
She can even speak Portuguese...
which few Portuguese can.

329
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,350
- She has a boyfriend of course.
- That she doesn't.

330
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:29,799
She works night and day, at the bank
and at home. She works too much.

331
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:33,791
If she were a nincompoop,
she'd already be married.

332
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:37,192
- Yes, I understand.
- Rita, pass me the brandy.

333
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:40,114
Brandy? It's long finished!

334
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:44,559
And get unused to such expensive
luxuries, we must save up.

335
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,758
- Drink water from the jug.
<i>- "Morphine", "benzene"...

336
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,799
- Benzene, drink it yourself!
- It's not that!

337
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,594
<i>"Crystalline"...</i>

338
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,158
Here it is... Found it!

339
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:58,113
I've made my day!

340
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:01,079
- The brandy is on me!
- Don't do that.

341
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:04,836
Buy a bit of cheese instead,
we haven't had any for a long time.

342
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:07,754
- For me, brandy is cheese.
- Teach them!

343
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:11,834
- Nothing to say, Mr. Daniel?
- Ah, me? I have the same opinion.

344
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:14,674
I'll go even further.
Cheese and brandy.

345
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,797
- You're joining the movement, then?
- Of course!

346
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:18,394
Bravo! You're one of us!

347
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,677
Both? Are you mad!

348
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:23,116
Do you think
we've won the lottery.

349
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:26,796
Well... The bell has rung.
No more work today!

350
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,280
Hear, hear!

351
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,474
Give us a kiss, you moaner!

352
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,233
Give over, you sloppy date!

353
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,792
Would you like to visit
the neighbourhood, Mr. Costa?

354
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,475
- Me?
- What? You haven't seen the sights?

355
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:42,519
It's embarrassing, but I must confess
I'd never been to Costa do Castelo.

356
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:47,550
I am not fit to go with you.
Look at my trousers. They've had it.

357
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:52,036
My life's had it!
Even my shoes make fun of them.

358
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:53,879
Yes, maybe...

359
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:57,234
Never you mind. I might be able
to get you one of my boss's suits.

360
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:59,869
- A suit?!
- Eh, you dandy!

361
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:03,830
He's a good bloke, you know. And if
I ask him, I'm sure he won't say no.

362
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,514
Bless him, poor soul.

363
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:07,558
Mr. Daniel, does he wear shoes, too?

364
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:09,871
- Yes, but they'd be too small.
- It doesn't matter,

365
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,601
I'll put my feet in a press
and shrink them.

366
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:15,434
- Good idea! See you later.
- See you later!

367
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:18,876
- Danny boy, don't forget!
- I won't. See you later!

368
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,440
See you later.

369
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:31,395
- Hey, neighbour!
- Yes?

370
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:34,359
- Can I borrow some parsley?
- Of course, Mrs. Rita.

371
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:41,791
Its' you, Deolinda. Come in...
What's up?

372
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:45,078
- Has Luisinha come home?
- No, but she should be here soon.

373
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,312
Was there anything you wanted?

374
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,837
- I've come to try on my outfit!
- Bravo! Long live the good life!

375
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,834
I'm glad you came!
You can help me lay the table.

376
00:26:58,361 --> 00:26:59,794
What's this?

377
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:07,075
- Good afternoon, Ma Rita!
- What's all this racket?

378
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,391
- You normally knock only once!
- What else could it be?

379
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,916
I'm eager to get home
and give you a kiss!

380
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:14,231
And I'm so hungry!

381
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:18,480
Good afternoon, Mr. Costa!
Good afternoon, Pa Januário!

382
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:21,394
- Good afternoon!
- You're acting very courtly.

383
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:26,071
- Deolinda! Did you bring the dress?
- Here it is.

384
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:31,239
Oh, dear... This might not be enough.

385
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,280
It was handed down from my mother
to my sister, and from her to me.

386
00:27:35,441 --> 00:27:37,636
That's not a dress,
it's a ball gown!

387
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,998
"Dear dress, to the ball we <i>go..."</i>

388
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,436
Let's see if I can work a miracle.

389
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:59,120
You know, Miss Luisinha... You're so
happy, I'd like to ask you something.

390
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:00,760
Yes? What is it then?

391
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:03,117
I'd like to go with my Alfredo
to the belvedere.

392
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,839
But my mother won't let us go alone.

393
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:08,198
- Which is right. So?
- If you went with us...

394
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:11,319
- I'm going to be the gooseberry?
- Oh, pleeease!

395
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,039
I won't make promises I might break.

396
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:24,549
So, it has the honours of a general!
"To <i>arms..."</i>

397
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:26,999
<i>- "Windscreen"!
- And for dessert,

398
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:30,233
<i>- 'Flamengo' cheese. 3 crowns.
- A kilo?

399
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,756
No, it's the brand.
It means it's good.

400
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:38,075
Chocolates, cheese, cognac...
What more do you want, 'Rothschild'?

401
00:28:38,681 --> 00:28:40,831
- Is Luisinha back?
- Yes, she's in her room

402
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:44,789
trying on Deolinda's dress.
Luisinha! Luisinha!

403
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:49,480
You're back Mr. Daniel?
I didn't know.

404
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:53,117
- Sorry it's only a trifle.
- For me? Thank you!

405
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:56,234
And forgive me for interrupting
your work of art.

406
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,790
You're making fun of me.
Making fun of poverty.

407
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:07,911
What a beautiful afternoon.
The most beautiful time of the day.

408
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,515
I think so, too, because
I'm no longer at the bank.

409
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:13,195
It's the time for intimacy
and exchange of secrets.

410
00:29:13,361 --> 00:29:16,797
- Isn't your car nice!
- Not mine... It's my boss's.

411
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:21,000
Of course. Your boss's. You can tell
he has good taste and money.

412
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:23,231
- Yes, he's wealthy.
- And naturally proud

413
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:25,676
and difficult to put up with
like every boss.

414
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:28,150
This one, on the contrary,
is down-to-earth

415
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:30,710
and treats me as well as possible.
- Then, that's why

416
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:33,076
he doesn't make you wear a uniform!
- That he does.

417
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,550
But I hate the white overall
and only put it on in the garage,

418
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:38,189
when I go off to work.
- I thought so.

419
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:42,157
A question - Are you going
to the cinema this evening?

420
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:45,916
No. I promised Deolinda I'd go
to Santa Luzia Belvedere.

421
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:49,875
She's got to go and see I don't know
what that she's very interested in.

422
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:53,431
- Can I come, too?
- Why not? The streets are free.

423
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:58,318
- Right beside you?
- Maybe... I'll think about it...

424
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,917
Luisinha!
You were so hungry...

425
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:06,675
Of course, I'd forgotten!

426
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:09,719
- Why did you call them, Ma Rita?
- It's dinnertime.

427
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:13,032
So what? Love lives on embraces
and caresses.

428
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:16,989
For lunch, three embraces,
and for dinner, four kisses.

429
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:20,319
- That's a good one!
- You're mad!

430
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:25,151
How nice.
Four kisses for dinner!

431
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:27,118
Right, let's have the soup.

432
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:41,035
- So many lights it looks like a crib.
- Isn't our Lisbon beautiful?

433
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,112
How high up are we, Mr. Daniel?

434
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:46,079
I don't know. But I feel
we are closer to God

435
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:49,153
and so, closer to the truth.
- Why do you say that?

436
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:51,437
Because I need you to believe me.

437
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:54,633
But... first,
I want you to forgive me.

438
00:30:54,801 --> 00:30:57,395
- Forgive you? What for?
- Forgive me,

439
00:30:57,881 --> 00:31:01,669
because at first I saw you as an
ordinary woman, an object of desire,

440
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,595
but now that I know you
and know how good and caring you are,

441
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,794
I feel I truly like you.

442
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:15,270
Luisinha, so I do not suffer
all the punishment I deserve,

443
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:17,671
at least tell me
you're not indifferent towards me.

444
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:20,515
You must have noticed already
that I like you, too

445
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:22,911
but we have known each other
for such a short while...

446
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,800
Are you afraid
I might disillusion you?

447
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:29,757
- Don't you believe me?
- Yes, Daniel, I believe you.

448
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:32,594
But who is to say your opinion of me

449
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:36,754
won't change again?
- Yes... Wanting you even more.

450
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:41,792
- Is it midnight already?
- Deolinda, let's go home!

451
00:31:43,161 --> 00:31:44,514
Already?

452
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:50,071
- Didn't you hear it's midnight?
- Yes, but it sounded like midday.

453
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,516
Come on,
they must be getting worried.

454
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:08,317
Daniel! Mr. Daniel!

455
00:32:09,681 --> 00:32:12,354
- What's up, Mr. Costa?
- So you left the little treasure

456
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:16,076
out all night?
- It doesn't catch cold.

457
00:32:16,241 --> 00:32:18,550
- Are you going downtown?
- Yes, why?

458
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:21,394
Because, if you don't mind,
I'll accept a lift.

459
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,557
Fine! I'm coming down!

460
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:32,074
Can I?

461
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:35,920
Thank you.

462
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:55,870
I love you, why I don't know,
But frankly

463
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:01,995
Maybe it isn't love, and if it so
Then, love is quite different.

464
00:33:03,161 --> 00:33:07,951
In vain I try to understand
What is the charm

465
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:14,635
What is the reason why I want you
With such a strong yearning

466
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:21,033
When you smile,
The look in your eyes is alluring.

467
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:26,836
But your nose...
Is like everyone else's

468
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:33,400
Handsome you are not
However, as soon as I saw you

469
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:38,997
I thought "why?" I don't know
I love you

470
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:42,473
- He's full of it, isn't he?
- He's probably won the lottery!

471
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,710
- Where are we going, boss?
- Downtown, Daniel.

472
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,758
Follow the steps.

473
00:33:55,441 --> 00:34:00,469
Handsome you are not
However, as soon as I saw you

474
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:07,271
I thought "why?" I don't know
I love you

475
00:34:07,561 --> 00:34:09,279
You...

476
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:19,992
- You've won the game again.
- How lucky!

477
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:27,435
Mr. Costa! Mr. Costa!
Mr. Costa!

478
00:34:30,761 --> 00:34:32,274
What is it, Rosa Maria?
What's happened?

479
00:34:32,441 --> 00:34:33,396
Here it is!

480
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:35,710
What's this?

481
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:38,031
Oh, dear God! What's this, child?

482
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,032
Speak, child!

483
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:45,079
Contract... Contract... I signed it...
The première is Tuesday evening.

484
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:47,670
Finally my favourite disciple

485
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:51,038
is entering the world of showbusiness!
- Congratulations, Mr. Costa!

486
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,237
- Congratulations, Rosa Maria!
- Where is the première?

487
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:55,153
- At 'Gruta do <i>Fado'.</i>
- Splendid!

488
00:34:55,321 --> 00:34:57,915
I assure you you'll be
well <i>accompanied...</i>

489
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,037
- God forbid. Never ever!
- No, not that, child.

490
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:01,873
I mean I will personally

491
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,670
accompany you on the guitar!
- I don't know how to thank you.

492
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:07,957
- And we'll all be cheering!
- Everyone!

493
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:10,840
Everyone! On Tuesday we'll all be
having fun at the 'Gruta'!

494
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:14,471
And I'll be getting the bill!
Did I say I was paying?

495
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,640
No, forgive me...
I got carried away.

496
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:25,514
TONIGHT22:30 THE SINGER
ROSA MARIA'S PREMlÈRE

497
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:29,196
ACCOMPANIED B Y HER TUTOR
SIMPLíCIO COSTA

498
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:35,960
Being a Fado singer is my creed

499
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:40,034
And Fado is a maze

500
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:43,989
Being a Fado singer is my creed

501
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:47,557
And Fado is a maze

502
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:51,839
I sing as I can and know

503
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:55,516
But my feelings I always show

504
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:59,600
I sing as I can and know

505
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:03,470
But my feelings I always show

506
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:07,475
And when it is quiet

507
00:36:07,641 --> 00:36:11,395
So as not to sadden me

508
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:15,190
And when it is quiet

509
00:36:15,401 --> 00:36:19,030
So as not to sadden me

510
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,035
I will sing with all my soul

511
00:36:23,201 --> 00:36:26,796
The soul of a Fado singer and woman

512
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:30,237
I will sing with all my soul

513
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:34,110
The soul of a Fado singer and woman

514
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,319
Ladies and gentlemen,

515
00:36:56,721 --> 00:37:00,760
after hearing the little princess
of the enchanting Fado

516
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:04,239
and the heir of the pure Fado,

517
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:07,712
you will have the pleasure of hearing
for the first time

518
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:10,236
the lark of true Fado.

519
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,276
That is,
the charming singer Rosa Maria

520
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:18,673
accompanied by her tutor
Simplício Costa on the guitar,

521
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:21,878
better known as Costa do Castelo.

522
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:51,071
Silence... Fado will be sung.

523
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:58,954
- Go on, Rosa.
- Hold on, Mr. Costa.

524
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:08,599
At first sight
They'll say I'm a Fado singer

525
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:14,230
This is not just a voice
It is a song from the heart

526
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:19,596
I dare not mourn Fado,
Sad and heavy like a lament,

527
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:24,551
But I'll pray it softly,
From the depth of my soul.

528
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:29,795
That is why I insist
And will not stop singing

529
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:35,150
Without a 'viola' or a guitar,
Like a lark until I can no more

530
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:40,715
With this fragile figure,
Destiny chose me

531
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:46,030
"Shall she be a singer?"
Be it or not, here I am

532
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:51,634
And just like Severa,
Oh, how I wish I were portentous

533
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:56,716
For I am neither tall nor short
And I do not lack boldness

534
00:38:57,081 --> 00:39:02,360
That is why I insist
And will not stop singing

535
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:07,641
Without a 'viola' or a guitar,
Like a lark until I can no more

536
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:49,598
- What are you having?
- Champagne.

537
00:40:06,121 --> 00:40:08,681
- Well, Pa Januário?
- Wonderful!

538
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:11,196
Luisinha, she sounds like a canary.

539
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,920
Come here.

540
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:42,681
Take this note to the young lady
sitting at the first table

541
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,877
near the stage.
- Yes, sir.

542
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:48,069
Thank you very much.

543
00:41:08,001 --> 00:41:09,514
Follow that car!

544
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:23,918
URGENT MATTER. MUST LEAVE.
WILL EXPLAIN TOMORROW.

545
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:36,239
Go on... Drink your coffee
while it's still hot.

546
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:39,120
- I don't feel like it, Ma Rita.
- Tut.

547
00:41:39,401 --> 00:41:42,871
Do you want to go to the bank
on an empty stomach? No way!

548
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:49,030
- And there's the toast, too. Go on!
- No, no. I can't.

549
00:41:49,201 --> 00:41:52,557
- Tut, tut, tut!
- Listen, has Mr. Daniel got up, yet?

550
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:55,599
- No. He didn't sleep here last night
- He didn't?

551
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:58,351
- See you later.
- Bye, my child.

552
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:13,357
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

553
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,353
- Good morning, Januário.
- How is it?

554
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:20,637
So, what does the paper say
about her début?

555
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:23,235
- What should it say? Well.
- What a triumph!

556
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,961
- I'm still dizzy!
- That's the beer... not used to it.

557
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:29,238
- I don't know how I got home!
- I even slept upside down!

558
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:31,517
- Upside down?
- With my feet at the head of the bed

559
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:33,751
and my head at the foot of the bed.

560
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:36,240
It's hot.

561
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,156
"Markets and <i>fairs."</i>
"Vaccination for <i>dogs."</i>

562
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:44,678
<i>- "Two escudos for a lion"?
- For a lion?!

563
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:46,479
"For a <i>lemon".</i>

564
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:50,031
- 400 run over and killed.
- In Lisbon?

565
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:51,873
In China.

566
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:56,430
That's it. If the girl
had done her father in,

567
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:01,356
her picture would be in the paper.
She was a success, didn't kill anyone

568
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:03,239
- I mean, she murdered the lyrics -

569
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:06,837
but, damn it, she was cheered
by 10, 20 thousand people,

570
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,994
she was an enormous success
and not even a word in the paper.

571
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:14,995
Spit it out woman.
What's wrong with you?

572
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:17,721
- Nothing's wrong!
- I can tell you Mr. Costa.

573
00:43:17,881 --> 00:43:22,113
- You're really part of the family.
- Go on, Rita. My lips are sealed.

574
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:25,598
It's because of Mr. Daniel.
After all,

575
00:43:25,761 --> 00:43:28,514
nobody knows who he is.
- He's a chauffeur.

576
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:33,513
I don't know. He turned up so well
dressed, in such good clothes,

577
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:36,394
claiming to be a chauffeur!
- Maybe they belong to his boss.

578
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:38,040
But there's more.

579
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,999
- He keeps giving us presents...
- That's not a fault.

580
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,800
But they cost him more
than the rent for the room.

581
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:46,475
Would a millionaire
come to Costa do Castelo?

582
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:49,917
- Should he have gone to the Palace?
- Alright! But he either spends

583
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:52,356
the evening here playing cards...
- Badly, thank God.

584
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:56,434
...or he doesn't sleep at home.
Yesterday he vanished without a word.

585
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,596
Forgive me, but there's certainly
a mystery around. That there is!

586
00:44:00,761 --> 00:44:02,399
- Vanished?
- And I noticed

587
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:04,950
it was when two policemen
went into the 'Gruta do <i>Fado'.</i>

588
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,919
- Oh, heck!
- And he hasn't showed up, yet.

589
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:09,833
Did you notice if he paid
with good money?

590
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,559
I don't know!

591
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:15,430
I now remember that his car
is left outside every night.

592
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:18,274
- Left outside?
- Yes, it's parked at the door.

593
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:22,275
That's why I'm saying it's a mystery.
But none of this would matter,

594
00:44:22,441 --> 00:44:24,477
if Luisinha hadn't fallen for him.

595
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:28,316
- There you go.
- Oh, hell... Oh, hell!

596
00:44:31,361 --> 00:44:33,192
It might be him.

597
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:37,274
Who is it? Come in!

598
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:42,799
Good morning. My mother is asking
if you could lend her the paper.

599
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:44,713
Come in, child.

600
00:44:46,961 --> 00:44:49,634
- Lend her the newspaper, Mr. Costa.
- If it's for news of the star,

601
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:51,519
there's nothing in it.
- None of that.

602
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:53,751
It's because of a woman
found dead in a car.

603
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:55,877
- A dead woman?
- Yes, ma'am!

604
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:59,158
A beautiful blonde girl. Very chic.

605
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,552
- They say the criminal got away.
- Some convict out free.

606
00:45:02,721 --> 00:45:06,077
What convict?
It was some gentleman or other!

607
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:07,674
Gentleman?

608
00:45:08,201 --> 00:45:09,600
Let me see...

609
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:12,595
Ah, here it is.
"Mysterious <i>murder".</i>

610
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:15,833
- God help us!
<i>- "Police in search of the murderer,

611
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:18,196
"seen yesterday evening with
his victim.

612
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:20,511
"A tall, well-dressed man,
of uncertain abode

613
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:23,149
"and very well-known
in Lisbon's bohemian <i>circles".</i>

614
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:27,075
- When was the crime, does it say?
<i>- "The body was found in the morning

615
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,913
"but according to the experts,

616
00:45:29,081 --> 00:45:32,198
"the crime must have taken place
about one a. <i>m..."</i>

617
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:35,239
Tall, well-dressed, uncertain abode?

618
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:38,677
Ah, Mr. Costa...
My heart tells me it's him.

619
00:45:38,841 --> 00:45:42,629
Excuse me, I'm taking the paper.
Sorry, but I've got beans cooking.

620
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:45,361
- What shall we do now?
- To the beans?

621
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:50,000
Oh... to the thief?
Let's search his room.

622
00:45:50,321 --> 00:45:51,879
Exactly.

623
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:54,600
Ah, ungrateful life!

624
00:45:54,761 --> 00:45:58,276
All I needed now, was to be given
the role of problem solver.

625
00:46:13,841 --> 00:46:16,230
Mr. Januário, you're the owner
of the house, open this suitcase.

626
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:17,595
Ready!

627
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:27,151
Just look at this!
What beautiful shirts!

628
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:31,675
- This is <i>'pitta'.</i>
<i>- 'Pitta'? It's silk.

629
00:46:31,841 --> 00:46:34,639
No, 'Pita <i>Shirts'.</i> 500 escudos!

630
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,798
And this contraption?

631
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,191
That's an electric appliance
for shaving.

632
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:43,512
You plug it in
and the bristles come out here.

633
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:45,637
Look, a watch.

634
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:48,713
And it's working.

635
00:46:49,361 --> 00:46:52,558
- It's next home is the pawnshop.
- This might all be his, but...

636
00:46:52,721 --> 00:46:55,281
But it might have known other owners.

637
00:46:56,081 --> 00:46:58,879
- What good pyjamas!
- This is all good...

638
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,437
There's something in here.

639
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:05,400
A ring... with a count's coat-of-arms!

640
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:07,517
- It's true!
- Didn't I say so?

641
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:10,354
- Ah, now the cat's out of the bag.
- Good morning.

642
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:13,039
Looking for something?

643
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:15,831
- What's that, Mr. André?
- This is blood.

644
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:21,071
But I didn't kill anybody! It's blood
off a rabbit I brought for dinner

645
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:23,471
which is in the kitchen,
waiting for your attention.

646
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:26,599
I came up to wash my hands
but didn't expect the pleasant surprise

647
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:29,150
of finding Mr. Costa
tidying my suitcase.

648
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:31,994
Pardon me, I wasn't tidying
your suitcase. It was Tareco,

649
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,795
the kitten you've seen around,
that's run away. Wasn't it?

650
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:35,996
Yes, yes.

651
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:38,391
We looked for him everywhere,
this was all that was left.

652
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:41,150
That's why I heard
"the cat's out of the <i>bag".</i>

653
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:43,471
Right, but it wasn't the cat.
Now I know where it is.

654
00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:44,710
- Oh, you do?
- It's in the kitchen,

655
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:46,678
it's the rabbit you brought!

656
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:49,793
How funny...

657
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:56,716
A cigarette? Thanks very much.

658
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,636
Ah, before I forget,
I owe you an explanation.

659
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:02,235
Last night,
I had to leave suddenly,

660
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:04,039
because, as you know,
so as to accompany you,

661
00:48:04,201 --> 00:48:06,351
I had to tell my boss I was ill.

662
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:08,113
But at the height of the party,
he came into the room...

663
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:10,920
- Your boss?
- Yes. He'd have fired me.

664
00:48:11,081 --> 00:48:14,596
There then.
We hadn't even thought of that!

665
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:17,229
- We were very confused.
- You bet we were.

666
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:18,880
Not to mention poor Luisinha...

667
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,157
Poor thing, she was so sad
on the way to the bank.

668
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:23,118
Yes, but I can...

669
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:27,158
Do you want to do a good deed?

670
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,995
Go and wait for her
and explain it all to her.

671
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,835
She was so distraught poor thing,
if you'd seen her...

672
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:35,754
Thanks, Costa, my friend.
You're straight up.

673
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:37,673
- I'll go and meet her immediately.
- Of course!

674
00:48:37,841 --> 00:48:41,390
And now let's get a swinging party
ready. Now, listen...

675
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,352
- Great! An excellent, amazing idea!
- What do you think?

676
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:50,558
How different love is in Portugal.

677
00:49:04,881 --> 00:49:07,031
- Good afternoon, Luisinha.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Daniel.

678
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:08,759
- I didn't expect you here.
- I came on purpose

679
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,560
so that you wouldn't think wrong
of me for another second.

680
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:13,996
- Me, why?
- Listen, Luisinha.

681
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:16,391
I want to explain
what happened yesterday.

682
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:37,352
- What's wrong?
- Does Mr. André Silveira live here?

683
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:41,036
No. The men living here are
Mr. Januário, the owner of the house,

684
00:49:41,201 --> 00:49:45,672
myself, Simplício Costa,
and the new tenant, Daniel da Silva.

685
00:49:45,841 --> 00:49:48,674
What's this Mr. Daniel da Silva like?

686
00:49:49,201 --> 00:49:53,035
I'll tell you. He's someone
like myself, but younger.

687
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,034
He dresses like me, but posher.

688
00:49:56,281 --> 00:50:00,479
Nice like me,
but is more... sought after.

689
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,753
Ah, I see, I see.

690
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:07,273
- And what time is he coming home?
- He should be here soon,

691
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:09,719
Thank you.

692
00:50:10,201 --> 00:50:12,237
Au revoir, monsieur.

693
00:50:25,561 --> 00:50:27,153
- Well?
- We've got him.

694
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:31,553
I'm not sure, yet. But it sounds
like him. He should be here soon.

695
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:55,352
It's him! At last.

696
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:58,035
- Do you think he'll cause trouble?
- I shouldn't think so.

697
00:50:58,201 --> 00:51:00,715
- So, when are you grabbing him?
- Later this evening.

698
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:08,553
Silence.

699
00:51:09,761 --> 00:51:14,118
I'll drink to the health and
happiness of our Luisinha,

700
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:17,679
so that this day
- I mean, this evening -

701
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,878
is repeated for many happy years.

702
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:23,437
Thank you, Mr. Costa.

703
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:27,516
And my friend Daniel is also
part of this toast,

704
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:31,271
because it was he who provided me
- I really must say -

705
00:51:31,441 --> 00:51:35,070
the opportunity to make this toast
and the others that'll follow,

706
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:38,472
by bringing this bottle of Port,

707
00:51:38,641 --> 00:51:40,950
which I salute.

708
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,231
- Well said, Mr. Costa!
- Bravo!

709
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:46,393
- Cheers for Luisinha!
- Cheers!

710
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:50,037
- Thank you, Ma Rita.
- To your happiness, Luisinha.

711
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:54,840
Attention!
The solemn moment has come

712
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:57,595
for this evening's big surprise...

713
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,435
Surprise?

714
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:04,199
- What could it be?
- One of his jokes.

715
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:09,076
Deolinda, get this ox out of here.

716
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:16,310
- I spy with my little eye...
- It's a canary.

717
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:19,917
...that sings but isn't a canary.
Can't anyone guess?

718
00:52:20,081 --> 00:52:23,835
I'll give you <i>one..."Give</i> you <i>one"...</i>
One, two, three.

719
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:27,833
Oh, a wireless!

720
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:36,114
Cheers for Luisinha!

721
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:45,120
- Does it play?
- Does it play?!

722
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:49,037
You open this... plug it in...

723
00:52:49,361 --> 00:52:52,512
...and it's like a tap with music.
You'll see!

724
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:04,878
- Oh, there you are!
- Oh, hell,

725
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:09,353
you're tuned in to the zoo!
- The coils are still cold.

726
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:10,840
Frappé.

727
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:14,795
Can't you see that the wave
hits the bulb and goes back

728
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:20,077
and so the sound can't get out.
You must warm up the carburettor...

729
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:27,757
Look, look!
It's starting to boil, look.

730
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:30,116
You can tell
Mr. Costa understands this.

731
00:53:36,641 --> 00:53:39,713
- Hey? What now?
- How nice!

732
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:43,556
An American-style dinner!
Come on everybody, let's dance!

733
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:47,038
Deolinda, do me a favour
and give me a hand with this table.

734
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:51,033
That's it, thank you.

735
00:53:51,201 --> 00:53:52,793
Does your Excellency dance?

736
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:04,596
- Would you like to dance, Luisinha?
- Of course.

737
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:13,117
Smile, if a woman tells you
She wants you

738
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:19,000
Smile,
Even if she swears she's suffering

739
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:25,109
Don't you believe her,
For she's delirious

740
00:54:26,321 --> 00:54:31,156
To love, to suffer,
What a lie

741
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:37,994
Smile, if a woman tells you
She wants you

742
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:44,159
Smile,
Even if she swears she's suffering

743
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:50,359
Don't you believe her,
For she's delirious

744
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:56,161
To love, to suffer,
What a lie

745
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:40,630
Can I help you?

746
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:43,873
Could you tell Mr. André da Silveira
to come and speak to me immediately.

747
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:47,795
André da Silveira?
There's no-one here with that name.

748
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:50,316
What's the new tenant called, then?

749
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:53,598
- Daniel da Silva.
- That's him.

750
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:57,633
Just a moment.

751
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:20,112
- Mr. Daniel...
- What's up?

752
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:22,590
There's a bloke
who wants to speak to you...

753
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:27,677
- Did you tell him I was in?
- Yes.

754
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,633
God's will be done.

755
00:57:03,601 --> 00:57:06,399
At last, I've caught you!

756
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:17,550
- Satisfied?
- Sort of.

757
00:57:17,721 --> 00:57:21,270
This was a difficult case
and it feels good to win.

758
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:24,353
- Does it? And now what?
- Now I'd advise you

759
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:27,035
to accompany me.
- And if I refuse?

760
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:30,836
- It's all considered. I'm not alone.
- And you, my cousin,

761
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:34,437
practically my brother,
offered to do such a hideous job?

762
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:38,515
Yes, so that you, a nobleman,
would not compromise our name,

763
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:40,797
because of some woman
you met on the street.

764
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,077
I forbid you to speak in those terms!

765
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:46,074
She is an honest woman,
worthy of our utmost respect.

766
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:49,597
- At least you think so.
- No! I'm sure of it.

767
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:52,514
- I am the one who is not worthy.
- What are you saying?

768
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,070
Yes, me. To win her,
I did not hesitate in coming here,

769
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:56,993
using a false name
and claiming to be a chauffeur.

770
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:59,152
And do you regret it?

771
00:57:59,881 --> 00:58:01,473
I do...

772
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:06,037
I regret the fact that I have
destroyed a life

773
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:09,193
that many others depend on.
Because that young girl

774
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:12,159
is the support of two old people
who treat her like their own child.

775
00:58:12,321 --> 00:58:14,437
Pure romanticism.

776
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:17,194
You can laugh.

777
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,633
A month ago I would have laughed
like you,

778
00:58:19,801 --> 00:58:22,190
because I didn't know
that this poverty you can see,

779
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:25,717
is where the happiness is that we,
the rich, are unaware of.

780
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:28,190
But, why did you feel so attracted?

781
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:29,999
I don't know...

782
00:58:34,401 --> 00:58:39,350
At first, I was attracted only to her.
But, then to these humble people.

783
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,792
If you saw how they give up all
that is dispensable in life,

784
00:58:42,961 --> 00:58:45,600
and the happiness with which they
receive what they cannot buy.

785
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:48,321
Some cheese,
a sweet, a bottle of wine...

786
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:52,190
I see. But how can you find such
discomfort attractive?

787
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:54,591
I prefer it a thousand times more
to the sad grandeur of our parlours,

788
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:58,310
where there's no chatter or laughter.
At least here there's sun, optimism,

789
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:01,678
the joy of living!
- Don't insist on this whim.

790
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:03,513
- Whim?
- Yes.

791
00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:05,876
But can't you see I'm truly taken

792
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,271
by this woman, and now I couldn't
live without her?

793
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:11,114
- What? You're thinking of marrying...
- Yes, of course!

794
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,158
Think about what you're doing, André.

795
00:59:13,321 --> 00:59:16,552
I'm leaving Lisbon tomorrow
and I have to sort this problem out.

796
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:18,712
What do you want me to tell
Aunt Mafalda?

797
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,232
Tell her you didn't find me.

798
00:59:21,401 --> 00:59:24,313
At least give me time to justify myself
before these poor people.

799
00:59:24,481 --> 00:59:26,358
But the problem is she knows
you are here,

800
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,797
and you know her well.
She would climb up the wall.

801
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,999
- Gastão, you could help.
- Me?

802
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:38,195
Not with that creature!
I'll do the same as Pilate.

803
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:41,956
I wash my hands of the matter.
Goodbye, André. All the best.

804
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:09,960
Well... I have to go to the 'Gruta'
to tidy some things up. See you later.

805
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:11,993
- See you later.
- I'm going upstairs,

806
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:14,880
because I've got the key with me,
and then my mother can't get in.

807
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:18,397
- Bye, Luisinha. Good night everyone.
- Good night.

808
01:00:21,161 --> 01:00:24,870
Luisinha. I have to tell you
something very important.

809
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:28,559
I can't carry on any longer
with a lie, a lie I made up

810
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:31,281
so as not to destroy a dream
that was very dear to me.

811
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:33,193
A lie?

812
01:00:36,481 --> 01:00:38,597
Ah! Here he is!

813
01:00:39,361 --> 01:00:42,558
- Aunt Mafalda?
- Yes, it is I.

814
01:00:43,241 --> 01:00:45,994
As the oldest representative
of the Vera-Flors,

815
01:00:46,161 --> 01:00:49,676
it is my duty to watch over you
and your cousin Gastão,

816
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:52,036
whom I raised as my own children.

817
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:56,638
It is unthinkable that a nobleman,
my own nephew,

818
01:00:56,801 --> 01:00:59,838
would make me stoop so low,

819
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:02,919
to come down this ignominy,

820
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:07,353
to stoop... Get me a chair,
I'm tired from the climb!

821
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:09,878
Pardon me, my dear aunt,
but before anything else, I...

822
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:14,159
You listen, first.
What are you doing in this slum?

823
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:15,800
<i>- "Slum"?!
<i>- "Slum"?!

824
01:01:15,961 --> 01:01:18,600
Aunt Mafalda, this is not my house,
I am only a tenant here.

825
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:22,674
Ah! We are in a boarding house then?!

826
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:24,792
How horrible...

827
01:01:24,961 --> 01:01:27,600
- And are you the owner?
- Yes, I am.

828
01:01:27,761 --> 01:01:32,073
- You know this person then?
- Yes. He's Daniel, a chauffeur.

829
01:01:32,241 --> 01:01:36,792
Chauffeur?! What rubbish!
This is Don André da Silveira,

830
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:39,919
- Count of Vera-Flor.
- Count?

831
01:01:40,081 --> 01:01:43,039
- You must be kidding!
- Step back, old man!

832
01:01:43,201 --> 01:01:46,273
You're speaking to a noblewoman.

833
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:49,674
What made you take board here, then?

834
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:52,435
- What else? You.
- Me?!

835
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:57,518
Yes, I confess. This was the only way
of getting close to you.

836
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:01,435
Ah, say no more.
A count... A nobleman...

837
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,998
Now I understand...
Your kindness and humility,

838
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:06,753
so we'd think you were our equal

839
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:09,481
and would accept you within
the intimacy of our poverty. And I...

840
01:02:09,641 --> 01:02:11,711
...and we believed you were...
- But, Luisinha, listen to me!

841
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:15,191
Now I know what your intentions were.
You were of course not giving a name

842
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:17,716
to an ordinary girl,
a modest girl, like me.

843
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:21,237
- Nor would I allow it!
- I wouldn't accept it, either!

844
01:02:21,401 --> 01:02:25,440
And now, more than ever!
A count chauffeur...

845
01:02:25,601 --> 01:02:29,230
- We didn't deserve this, Mr. Daniel.
- What is going on here, after all?

846
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:32,279
- Step back, Mr. tenant.
- Not back, I always go forward!

847
01:02:32,441 --> 01:02:35,194
- I was in the infantry.
- Calm down, then.

848
01:02:36,161 --> 01:02:39,597
Right, Luisinha...
I confess I lied...

849
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:42,753
But never has a lie
served such noble intentions.

850
01:02:42,921 --> 01:02:45,230
And I swear that,
I pretended to be small and humble,

851
01:02:45,401 --> 01:02:47,915
to be able to reach up high
where I placed you.

852
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:53,350
Now that I have lost all, all I want
is to prove to these good people

853
01:02:53,601 --> 01:02:57,150
that I am still worthy
of their friendship and trust.

854
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,879
Goodbye, Luisinha.

855
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:05,997
This is how noble people act.

856
01:03:06,401 --> 01:03:10,155
I can't believe it...
He was so good to us!

857
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:17,159
Well, I'm glad I brought peace
and happiness to this house.

858
01:03:17,921 --> 01:03:20,071
Your arm, Gastão.

859
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:21,279
"Regarding the state of the car,

860
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:26,999
"Mr. André da Silveira
only has minor scratches,

861
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:32,956
"it seems, however, that he is
suffering from a disturbed <i>mind."</i>

862
01:04:33,801 --> 01:04:35,280
Poor bloke.

863
01:04:35,441 --> 01:04:38,239
And I was so looking forward
to my first day's holiday.

864
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:40,710
And all this
because of that snake of an aunt!

865
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,519
- The devil take her!
- Far away!

866
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:45,149
If I had known that it was her
in that car,

867
01:04:45,321 --> 01:04:48,631
instead of this photo there would be
one of her flying through the window.

868
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,076
- Hello there!
- If only I knew how he was.

869
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:54,718
- He's delirious.
- Delirious? Has he got a fever?

870
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:58,954
Yes, quite high!
He keeps calling for some Luisinha,

871
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:02,000
who must have something
to do with this.

872
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:05,073
Yes, she does... unfortunately.

873
01:05:05,241 --> 01:05:09,154
I knew it must be something
to do with a woman.

874
01:05:09,361 --> 01:05:11,352
I'd like to meet her.

875
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:15,434
Oh, doctor! That's all we needed!
There's been enough scandal as it is!

876
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:20,277
I mean...
Meet her... clinically!

877
01:05:20,441 --> 01:05:23,751
But I've already met her personally

878
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:27,834
and I can tell you she doesn't need
your diagnosis.

879
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:30,071
It's possible, but...

880
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:33,358
No <i>'buts'.</i>
You tell me André's story,

881
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:35,830
and then say I can't go there.
- What? What about the branding

882
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:37,275
in Benavente tomorrow, uncle?

883
01:05:37,441 --> 01:05:40,080
Until this mess with your cousin
is not sorted out,

884
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:42,357
I couldn't care less about the cattle
or the land.

885
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,512
Abegão is there,
he can sort himself out.

886
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:46,672
God willing, André will get over this.

887
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:50,356
I've even lost my appetite.
Do you know what I had for lunch?

888
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:53,991
Roast chicken,
three slices of lamb

889
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:55,674
and two mullet.
- In your case, uncle,

890
01:05:55,841 --> 01:05:57,433
that wouldn't even fill
a hole in your tooth!

891
01:05:57,601 --> 01:05:59,876
I'm feeling really weak.

892
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:02,601
The only thing keeping me going are
the 4 pints of milk I had a while ago.

893
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:06,356
- Can you imagine - me on milk!
- Watch out for anaemia!

894
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:08,555
Look, here comes the doctor.

895
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,469
Well? Did you get anything
out of my sister?

896
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:17,554
You know, it's difficult.
I didn't dare. She's in such a mood...

897
01:06:17,721 --> 01:06:20,519
The usual.
I've put up with her for 30 years!

898
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:23,479
My opinion, however,
is that Luisinha should come

899
01:06:23,641 --> 01:06:26,030
and be your nephew's nurse herself.

900
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:29,876
Of course! And if my sister gets out
of hand, I'll deal with her.

901
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:32,794
Do you know her, Don Gastão?
Is she an honest person?

902
01:06:32,961 --> 01:06:36,237
- There's no doubt about that.
- Don't hesitate then.

903
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:39,711
It is absolutely necessary
to calm down such restlessness.

904
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:44,875
Nothing will deter me.
She'll come. You'll see!

905
01:07:07,801 --> 01:07:10,190
- Is anyone missing?
- The gardener.

906
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:12,795
When he comes,
tell him he's fired, then.

907
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:16,158
That's what happens to anyone
who steps out of line.

908
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:17,879
- Did you hear?
- Yes, ma'am!

909
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:20,316
Be quiet. No-one's talking to you.

910
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:39,197
You, José,
when you served tea today,

911
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:44,117
your bowtie was crooked. I do not want
any abuse or lack of respect.

912
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:50,870
And you, Amália, do not cough again
in the morning, or you'll wake me up.

913
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:54,238
- I've got a cold, ma'am.
- Cough silently.

914
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:56,869
Or cough at some other time.

915
01:07:58,081 --> 01:08:00,231
And you, Josefa,
what are you thinking about?

916
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:03,199
- Me? Nothing ma'am.
- With that look?

917
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:07,879
I could swear
it was something stupid about me.

918
01:08:13,321 --> 01:08:16,233
Your button is undone.

919
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,877
- Did you say something?
- I didn't say anything.

920
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,918
Be quiet and button up.

921
01:08:25,241 --> 01:08:27,311
- My lady...
- Button up, I'm telling you!

922
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:30,837
- Pardon me, My Lady...
- In line! In line, I repeat!

923
01:08:37,601 --> 01:08:39,876
And now, Mrs. Anastácia...

924
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,597
Why did you put eggs
in the white sauce,

925
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,798
knowing I'm on a diet?
Answer me!

926
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:47,916
I'm sorry,

927
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:50,800
but I'm the one who put the eggs.
- You?

928
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:57,316
You agreed between you.
One said yes and the other agreed.

929
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:01,119
In that case,
at the end of the month, out!

930
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:04,910
Right, it won't be at the end
of the month, but now! I'm sick of this!

931
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:09,677
- Educate them!
- Educate? A Marchioness?!

932
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:14,198
Get out! Get out of my sight!
Out, didn't you hear!

933
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:17,916
- Just a word, my lady...
- Speak.

934
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:22,349
I just wanted to say that Don Simão
wishes to speak to you,

935
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:25,035
and he is waiting in the library.
- Oh, is he?

936
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:28,591
Just as well,
he hasn't heard me today.

937
01:09:45,601 --> 01:09:48,354
- Did you send for me?
- Yes, I did.

938
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:50,756
Here I am. Explain yourself.

939
01:09:50,921 --> 01:09:53,640
Well... Let's not beat
about the bush.

940
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:56,839
As you know,
I don't mince words.

941
01:09:57,001 --> 01:09:59,879
Yes... What's mince
got to do with it?

942
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:02,839
Mince, no.
Mess. And you made it.

943
01:10:03,001 --> 01:10:05,276
Because of you André is lying
in a bed,

944
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:08,751
with his face all messed up.
- That's all I needed! It's my fault?

945
01:10:09,401 --> 01:10:12,518
Yes. If you hadn't gone
to Costa do Castelo,

946
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:17,072
he wouldn't have gone out of his mind
all the way down there.

947
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:21,280
You might as well say I was the one
who dug the hole he's in.

948
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:24,751
You didn't dig the hole, but you did
worse, you interfered in his life.

949
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:27,913
- Me? What are you getting at?
- This is the conclusion,

950
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:32,279
Dr. Miranda wants us to get
the young woman André is calling for.

951
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:36,957
- Luisinha? Have you gone mad?
- I haven't. But he might!

952
01:10:37,121 --> 01:10:40,158
Will you take that responsibility?

953
01:10:41,441 --> 01:10:45,559
A stranger in our house...
And a pretty girl, at that.

954
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:51,161
That's why! What we need here
is youthfulness, joy, light...

955
01:10:51,521 --> 01:10:54,831
Dash it all!
Open the windows, let the air in!

956
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:58,710
- I'll catch a cold!
- Get rid of those cobwebs!

957
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:13,433
There! Oh, I'm sorry!

958
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:15,876
- It's for sure!
- Is it? What did aunty say?

959
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:18,794
It was a bit difficult,
but she gave me a free hand.

960
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:22,476
- Do you think Luisinha will come?
- Gastão will go. He's so diplomatic

961
01:11:22,641 --> 01:11:25,474
he would probably carry her here.
- Thanks, uncle Simão.

962
01:11:25,641 --> 01:11:30,192
Don't thank me. You can't imagine
my joy in going against your aunt.

963
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:31,999
I'm in heaven!

964
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:34,635
Watch out... She's coming, watch out!

965
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,234
Luisinha...

966
01:11:42,401 --> 01:11:43,629
Luisinha!

967
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,837
Can you hear him? Poor thing!

968
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:49,200
- The way he calls for her.
- Luisinha...

969
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:51,519
He doesn't have any strength left.

970
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:56,271
- Send for her as soon as possible.
- Right away.

971
01:11:59,681 --> 01:12:02,275
You've no idea!
That's all they're talking about!

972
01:12:02,441 --> 01:12:04,875
You and André are today's heroes.

973
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,272
I don't like such publicity at all,
fame without gain...

974
01:12:08,441 --> 01:12:11,319
Can you hear the phone?
It must be the newspapers already.

975
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,594
Come in!

976
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:18,871
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Manuela de Vilhena.

977
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,759
Ah, put her through.

978
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:23,639
Give me a cigarette.

979
01:12:28,121 --> 01:12:30,191
What does this nosy parker want?

980
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:38,278
Hello, darling!

981
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:43,070
Me? I couldn't be better!

982
01:12:44,881 --> 01:12:46,712
Yes, yes, I already knew.

983
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:50,749
Darling, I was never interested
in André!

984
01:12:52,441 --> 01:12:55,513
Engaged?! What an idea!

985
01:12:57,401 --> 01:13:00,438
No... It was nothing more
than a joke.

986
01:13:03,761 --> 01:13:07,231
But thanks for the news, anyway.

987
01:13:08,481 --> 01:13:09,630
Bitch!

988
01:13:19,241 --> 01:13:20,913
Hello there!

989
01:13:24,081 --> 01:13:27,517
At last! Come on down!
Give me your bag.

990
01:13:28,281 --> 01:13:31,159
This is Luisinha,
uncle Januário, and Mrs. Rita.

991
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:34,358
- My uncle, Don Simão.
- For many happy years.

992
01:13:34,521 --> 01:13:38,070
- Pleased to meet you.
- Bravo! So, this is Luisinha.

993
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:41,950
- My nephew has very good taste!
- Oh, Don Simão!

994
01:13:42,121 --> 01:13:47,115
If I were young, I'd also lose
my mind over such a pretty face!

995
01:13:48,121 --> 01:13:50,077
Come in! Come in!

996
01:14:05,201 --> 01:14:06,520
Come in! Come in!

997
01:14:07,961 --> 01:14:11,556
You'll be well looked after, Luisa.
You'll like it, you'll see.

998
01:14:14,761 --> 01:14:18,754
- What's this invasion?
- It's Luisinha who's arrived.

999
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:23,350
But Luisinha is one,
and I can see three people!

1000
01:14:23,721 --> 01:14:27,157
- This is Ma Rita and uncle Januário.
- I know that very well!

1001
01:14:27,321 --> 01:14:30,233
- But what are they doing here?
- Come on, sis'!

1002
01:14:31,161 --> 01:14:33,516
Has the whole Costa do Castelo
moved in?

1003
01:14:33,681 --> 01:14:35,751
- We came because we were asked to!
- Of course!

1004
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:38,879
Well, I never! We were even told
Mr. André could die,

1005
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,111
if Luisinha refused to see him!

1006
01:14:41,281 --> 01:14:44,398
And the whole family came
so he wouldn't die!

1007
01:14:47,281 --> 01:14:49,556
Pardon me, ma'am,
but I'd never come here on my own.

1008
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:53,999
Of course! Sis', they're here
to do us a great favour.

1009
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:57,233
- And they're our guests, too.
- The three of them?!

1010
01:14:57,401 --> 01:14:59,278
No, ma'am,
Luisinha is the guest.

1011
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:01,875
We've come to work.
That's what was arranged.

1012
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:04,430
- Arranged with whom?
- With me, aunt.

1013
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:08,390
Didn't you fire the gardener
and the cook? Voilá, the substitutes!

1014
01:15:08,561 --> 01:15:11,473
- Well done.
- Well done, no. Badly done!

1015
01:15:12,081 --> 01:15:14,390
Who nominated you trustee
of the servants?

1016
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:16,472
In that case, let's go.

1017
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:20,475
Wait!
Who gave you orders to leave?

1018
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:24,277
- No-one's going without permission!
- Hear, hear!

1019
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:27,592
Firmino,
take them to their rooms.

1020
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:29,957
They can start working.

1021
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:33,231
You, young lady, come with me.

1022
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:06,235
Luisinha!

1023
01:16:07,561 --> 01:16:09,438
Thank God,
you're better than I thought.

1024
01:16:09,601 --> 01:16:11,512
- Luisinha...
- Come on, calm down.

1025
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:14,115
Promise me you'll do everything
to get better quickly.

1026
01:16:14,281 --> 01:16:17,557
I promise I'll do everything...
just to have you near me.

1027
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:21,593
Er... Is this more delirium?

1028
01:16:21,761 --> 01:16:25,470
Now that you've got over the accident
mind you don't die of the cure!

1029
01:16:27,601 --> 01:16:31,958
One, two, three, four, five...

1030
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:39,117
...47, 48, 49, 50.

1031
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:45,630
The Marchioness's medicines
drive me crazy!

1032
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:49,035
And then, of course,
if they don't get to her on time,

1033
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:51,635
there's hell to pay.

1034
01:16:55,321 --> 01:16:56,595
There.

1035
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:01,876
Take this to her ladyship
and don't tarry along the way.

1036
01:17:10,481 --> 01:17:12,631
You're two minutes late.

1037
01:17:17,201 --> 01:17:20,159
It's what I keep saying -
nobody cares about my health.

1038
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,520
You can carry on.

1039
01:18:04,321 --> 01:18:07,358
- Good morning, aunt Mafalda.
- Good morning, Gastão.

1040
01:18:07,601 --> 01:18:11,037
As I took my medicine
two minutes late,

1041
01:18:11,361 --> 01:18:14,592
we'll have to wait two minutes
for lunch.

1042
01:18:15,641 --> 01:18:17,871
My day has been spoilt.

1043
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:21,636
I don't know how to get back
the two lost minutes.

1044
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:24,235
I was just thinking about that.

1045
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:29,318
Well, let's sit down.

1046
01:18:43,521 --> 01:18:45,477
Where's Don Simão?

1047
01:18:45,681 --> 01:18:49,196
Don Simão is having lunch downstairs
with those people.

1048
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:55,873
Yes, sir. I'd seen people eating well
but like you, Don Simão,

1049
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:58,555
I've only met one other person.
- He eats as much as I do?

1050
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,396
Even more so! Let me tell you.

1051
01:19:01,561 --> 01:19:03,711
More? I don't believe it.
It's not possible.

1052
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:06,839
- Where is such a phenomenon?
- He's our tenant, Mr. Costa.

1053
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:08,593
Mind you, he's a glutton.

1054
01:19:08,681 --> 01:19:12,037
Well, bring him here then.
This is something I want to see.

1055
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:14,157
What? More people?

1056
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:17,960
Your sister is ready
to swallow us up.

1057
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:22,080
Send for this hero. As for my sister,
leave her to me.

1058
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:24,835
If that's your wish, Don Simão,
all we have to do is send for him.

1059
01:19:25,001 --> 01:19:26,593
Not a scrap will be left!

1060
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:32,793
Well, my dear aunt, I haven't had
such a good meal in a long time!

1061
01:19:32,961 --> 01:19:36,510
Yes... The new cook isn't bad.

1062
01:19:37,001 --> 01:19:40,311
So it was a good idea
to bring her here, after all.

1063
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:44,030
As she's here,
we might as well make use of her.

1064
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:49,076
But let's not talk about things past.
Yesterday's upsets are enough.

1065
01:19:49,241 --> 01:19:52,278
- Mrs. Mafalda.
- What are you doing here?

1066
01:19:52,441 --> 01:19:55,592
It's 12:30, time for the medicine
to help your digestion.

1067
01:19:56,641 --> 01:19:57,756
Punctual!

1068
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:02,039
But who told Firmino
to find himself a substitute?

1069
01:20:02,201 --> 01:20:05,352
Am I not the nurse then?
Go on, open your mouth.

1070
01:20:05,521 --> 01:20:07,716
I'm here to look after
those who are ill.

1071
01:20:10,761 --> 01:20:13,480
You know, you don't look well today.

1072
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:16,872
No, I don't.
At last,

1073
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:20,238
there's someone
worried about my health.

1074
01:20:20,401 --> 01:20:23,199
You've found your guardian angel.

1075
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:27,149
And as you are in good company,
I'll go. Excuse me.

1076
01:20:29,361 --> 01:20:32,159
- Goodbye, Luisinha.
- Goodbye, Don Gastão.

1077
01:20:32,321 --> 01:20:35,438
Right, I'm going to get
my beauty sleep.

1078
01:20:37,161 --> 01:20:40,198
- I like to be read to...
- Oh, do you?

1079
01:20:40,361 --> 01:20:42,670
But, unfortunately, in this house...

1080
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:47,232
My brother is only interested
in horses, bulls and Fado singers.

1081
01:20:47,921 --> 01:20:52,836
Gastão, as you can see,
tries to get away whenever he can.

1082
01:20:53,361 --> 01:20:56,194
If you like, it would be my pleasure
to read to you.

1083
01:20:56,361 --> 01:20:57,953
Really?

1084
01:20:58,121 --> 01:21:02,478
It's funny,
but I think I'm starting to like you.

1085
01:21:02,641 --> 01:21:05,314
Well, I thought you were nice
as soon as I saw you, Mrs. Mafalda.

1086
01:21:05,481 --> 01:21:07,073
Oh, you did, did you?

1087
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:09,114
Well, well.

1088
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:13,752
Go and get the book that's on
the bedside table, in my bedroom.

1089
01:21:13,921 --> 01:21:16,037
And wait for me in the parlour.

1090
01:21:21,281 --> 01:21:24,830
- Deolinda! Deolinda!
- I'm coming Mr. Costa!

1091
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:33,832
- Can I help you, Mr. Costa?
- Yes.

1092
01:21:34,001 --> 01:21:36,515
I'm giving you the house key,
you keep an eye on this

1093
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:40,560
and take Tareco upstairs because
I don't trust him with the fish.

1094
01:21:41,881 --> 01:21:43,394
- But where are you off to?
- I'm off to the countryside!

1095
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:46,359
- To Campo (country) Pequeno?
- Good heavens! On holiday!

1096
01:21:46,521 --> 01:21:49,593
- You're joking!
- Look, with a sealed letter, too.

1097
01:21:50,121 --> 01:21:54,797
"When Don Simão found out
you eat more than him,

1098
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:58,637
"he told me to ask you to come here

1099
01:21:59,401 --> 01:22:01,312
"and <i>are..."</i>
- Are?

1100
01:22:01,521 --> 01:22:05,799
<i>"...</i> are-commended
you bring your guitar,

1101
01:22:06,081 --> 01:22:08,675
"as he enjoys Fado very <i>much."</i>

1102
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,230
Look, child, I've loosened
my belt by three holes already.

1103
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:13,756
Yes, sir. If I didn't know
Mr. Januário's handwriting,

1104
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:15,354
I'd say it was forged.

1105
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:19,315
Here's the key.
Lock everything up

1106
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:23,880
and be very careful with thieves,
in case they leave what is not ours.

1107
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:29,078
See you on my return.
What's the matter?

1108
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:31,232
- Did I step on your foot?
- No, sir.

1109
01:22:31,401 --> 01:22:34,154
It's just that my mother said the
only man who can kiss me is my dad.

1110
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:36,152
Oh, "my daughter"!

1111
01:22:47,481 --> 01:22:50,041
Luísa! Luisinha!

1112
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:54,159
Luísa! Luisinha!

1113
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:57,874
'Her Highness' is calling.

1114
01:22:58,481 --> 01:22:59,914
She's woken up.

1115
01:23:03,721 --> 01:23:07,236
- Did you have a good rest?
- No, I had a nightmare.

1116
01:23:07,401 --> 01:23:10,916
- I dreamt of mice.
- Mice? That's your stomach.

1117
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:12,514
Mice in my stomach?

1118
01:23:12,681 --> 01:23:15,400
- Maybe. I did eat cheese.
- See?

1119
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:18,316
Don't you think I am paler today?

1120
01:23:18,481 --> 01:23:20,233
- It's the colour of your bow.
- Oh, is it?

1121
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:23,757
Purple makes you look a lot...
A lot less younger.

1122
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:27,277
- Do you think so?
- Light things suit you.

1123
01:23:27,641 --> 01:23:29,359
Can I?

1124
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:33,840
Do you want to see?

1125
01:23:38,601 --> 01:23:40,432
As a matter of fact...

1126
01:23:40,761 --> 01:23:42,877
And on such a cheerful lady, too.

1127
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:44,838
Speaking of which,
do you play anything, Mrs. Mafalda?

1128
01:23:45,001 --> 01:23:47,834
- No. I hate music.
- I really enjoy it.

1129
01:23:48,001 --> 01:23:50,640
Unfortunately, I haven't touched
a piano for more than two years.

1130
01:23:50,801 --> 01:23:53,520
- Can you play?
- Yes. Will you let me try?

1131
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:56,878
No. This piano has been closed
for more than ten years.

1132
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:59,714
- Ah, I'd better not then.
- But,

1133
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:03,112
let me see if you really can play.
Go on. Try it.

1134
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:18,473
What's this, Firmino?

1135
01:26:18,961 --> 01:26:21,350
A miracle, sir. A miracle.

1136
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:34,874
What's this?!

1137
01:26:35,761 --> 01:26:37,717
- That's enough!
- My God!

1138
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:41,510
What are you doing there? Out!
And you - get out of my sight!

1139
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:47,032
Out. I need to speak to my brother
in private.

1140
01:26:48,361 --> 01:26:51,433
- I was wondering how long it'd last.
- Brother Simão,

1141
01:26:51,601 --> 01:26:54,559
we have to throw these people out
as soon as possible.

1142
01:26:54,721 --> 01:26:58,191
Ah! Now you've been served,
André is better

1143
01:26:58,361 --> 01:27:01,592
and everyone looks after you,
you want to put them out.

1144
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:03,991
But can't you see
that this girl's presence

1145
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:07,631
could be fatal for our nephew?
- Fatal? Why?

1146
01:27:07,801 --> 01:27:10,679
- She's not of the same social class.
- There you are, then.

1147
01:27:10,841 --> 01:27:14,197
You destroyed your own life
because of such a stupid prejudice

1148
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:16,477
by not marrying the man you loved
after all.

1149
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:19,633
Let them make a sacrifice as I did!

1150
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:21,712
Out! I said, out!

1151
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:25,118
I don't want these people here!
This is not a hotel!

1152
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:29,911
- But listen, sister...
- I do not want to hear a word! Out!

1153
01:27:30,281 --> 01:27:32,670
- My lady...
- What do you want?

1154
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:37,392
Miss Luisinha says
it's time to take your medicine.

1155
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:42,032
See? You see?
And I have to swallow this.

1156
01:27:49,961 --> 01:27:52,236
- Ah, it's you, Mr. Costa.
- How do, Mr. Januário!

1157
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:56,597
- Be quiet!
- Is there someone ill?

1158
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:58,592
No, but all hell broke loose,
this morning!

1159
01:27:58,761 --> 01:28:00,513
Hell? Oh, hell!

1160
01:28:03,721 --> 01:28:06,155
Come through the kitchen
because of the Marchioness.

1161
01:28:25,441 --> 01:28:26,999
- Look, it's Mr. Costa!
- Ma Rita!

1162
01:28:27,161 --> 01:28:31,040
- Give us a big hug!
- Don't make any noise!

1163
01:28:31,201 --> 01:28:33,954
Oh, yes!
The Marchioness is as sore as a bear!

1164
01:28:34,121 --> 01:28:37,670
Oh, hell, so there's no talk of food!
What about the patient? And Luisinha?

1165
01:28:37,841 --> 01:28:40,560
They're fine!
Be careful, come with me.

1166
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:48,479
- Here's Mr. Costa.
- Come in, come in!

1167
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:50,600
Can we come in?

1168
01:28:55,281 --> 01:28:58,318
- Mr. André! How are you?
- Are you getting better?

1169
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:00,751
- Luisinha!
- Hello, hello!

1170
01:29:00,921 --> 01:29:03,594
- This here is the phenomenon.
- Mr. Simplício Costa

1171
01:29:03,761 --> 01:29:06,514
and Don Simão.
- Gives us a hand, then!

1172
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:10,230
So, you're the man capable
of eating this world and the next?

1173
01:29:10,401 --> 01:29:13,199
I wouldn't say no to this world,
but the next is too much.

1174
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,557
We'll see that later.

1175
01:29:18,841 --> 01:29:22,231
I've had the cook roast
a big lamb, like this.

1176
01:29:22,481 --> 01:29:25,075
One? What about you, sir?

1177
01:29:25,241 --> 01:29:27,357
No, it's one for both of us...

1178
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:30,276
Oh, he's challenging!

1179
01:29:30,441 --> 01:29:33,319
Excuse, excuse me.
And what time is dinner?

1180
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:36,314
- It's at seven.
- At seven? Oh, heck...

1181
01:29:36,481 --> 01:29:39,871
Couldn't it be a sort of matinee?
I haven't had lunch, yet.

1182
01:29:40,521 --> 01:29:42,910
Uncle, a lamb won't be enough.

1183
01:29:43,281 --> 01:29:45,749
How funny,
"matinee" and the bell's ringing.

1184
01:29:45,921 --> 01:29:48,276
- It's my sister who's blown her top.
- Oh, hell!

1185
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:50,955
- I'll die on an empty stomach!
- God help us!

1186
01:29:51,121 --> 01:29:52,873
- Luisinha!
- Here it comes!

1187
01:29:53,761 --> 01:29:57,037
Don't worry.
I've an idea to sort everything out.

1188
01:29:57,201 --> 01:29:59,078
I'll introduce you as a scholar.

1189
01:29:59,241 --> 01:30:01,755
- What if she protests?
- At scholars? Don't worry, old chap,

1190
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:03,559
let things run their course.

1191
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:06,196
Luisinha! Luísa!

1192
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,278
Luísa! Luísa!

1193
01:30:08,441 --> 01:30:12,514
- Here she comes! Hide!
- Where? Under the bed?!

1194
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:14,400
Come here.

1195
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:26,590
Don't come out before I call you.

1196
01:30:40,921 --> 01:30:43,355
Luísa! Luisinha!

1197
01:30:52,361 --> 01:30:55,910
What's this? A man on a perch?!

1198
01:30:56,961 --> 01:30:58,917
What are you doing there?

1199
01:30:59,241 --> 01:31:02,074
Forgive me, but I don't know either.

1200
01:31:11,281 --> 01:31:13,511
Could it be possible?

1201
01:31:13,681 --> 01:31:16,070
I don't know. Word of honour.

1202
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:21,195
Simplício!

1203
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:23,716
Mafalda, my love!

1204
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:29,516
Heavens, what are you doing here?

1205
01:31:29,681 --> 01:31:31,637
But are you... you?!

1206
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:34,235
Keep your voice down,
you'll get me into trouble.

1207
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:38,440
But tell me, why did you come?
Have you been looking for me?

1208
01:31:38,641 --> 01:31:42,156
For 30 years... Are you the dragon...

1209
01:31:42,321 --> 01:31:45,518
- I mean, the Marchioness?
- Yes, I am.

1210
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:50,034
But where have you been hiding
to show up only now?

1211
01:31:50,401 --> 01:31:53,711
I don't know...
Your parents took you to Spain

1212
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:57,157
and I emigrated to Africa
and died there.

1213
01:31:57,561 --> 01:31:59,313
You died?

1214
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:03,997
I died to the world, to come to life now
that I've found you again.

1215
01:32:04,161 --> 01:32:08,871
- And are you married?
- No, I'm a widow.

1216
01:32:09,681 --> 01:32:14,152
But I have always been true to you,

1217
01:32:14,601 --> 01:32:18,640
my first love.
- So have I, Mafalda.

1218
01:32:18,841 --> 01:32:22,470
As faithful as a dog to its master.

1219
01:32:23,601 --> 01:32:27,116
And have you never forgotten me?

1220
01:32:27,801 --> 01:32:32,158
Never. I still keep your picture
of when you were a young girl.

1221
01:32:33,961 --> 01:32:37,431
I have kept it here lovingly.

1222
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:40,280
Look.

1223
01:32:40,441 --> 01:32:43,001
A reminder of the past.

1224
01:32:43,921 --> 01:32:46,389
- And those papers?
- They're tickets.

1225
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,439
This is where I keep
all the pawn tickets.

1226
01:32:50,201 --> 01:32:55,116
Here's the balcony
where you serenaded me from.

1227
01:32:55,721 --> 01:32:58,474
- Do you remember?
- Do I remember?

1228
01:32:58,681 --> 01:33:01,718
You even threw a plan pot at me
and broke my head.

1229
01:33:01,881 --> 01:33:06,033
That's when I realized I loved you.

1230
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,436
Why have we found each other,
Mafalda,

1231
01:33:09,601 --> 01:33:12,559
if the reasons why we separated
still exist?

1232
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:15,519
- You're a noblewoman, rich...
- Be quiet.

1233
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:18,599
You know I'll give everything up
for you.

1234
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:21,958
If nobility and fortune
are an embarrassment,

1235
01:33:22,121 --> 01:33:26,114
- I'll throw both out of the window.
- No, close the window!

1236
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:30,913
I don't want your sacrifice.
Both, no... You can throw out nobility.

1237
01:33:31,201 --> 01:33:33,351
I'm not mercenary.

1238
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:36,118
My God... my brother Simão.

1239
01:33:36,281 --> 01:33:39,034
Just pretend nothing happened
and leave matters to me.

1240
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:51,273
- Has this gentleman said who he is?
- Her ladyship has only just arrived.

1241
01:33:51,441 --> 01:33:53,955
Let me introduce you
to an old friend, then.

1242
01:33:54,121 --> 01:33:56,430
- You know each other?
- Mr. Simplício Costa.

1243
01:33:56,601 --> 01:34:00,355
- From a noble family. The Costas.
- Costas do Castelo.

1244
01:34:00,521 --> 01:34:05,515
Yes, I know them well.
A large, noble family.

1245
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,354
The Costas, on both sides.

1246
01:34:09,001 --> 01:34:11,515
I thought of inviting him
to be our librarian.

1247
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:15,754
Well thought of.
You know I love books,

1248
01:34:15,921 --> 01:34:18,310
libraries...
- Oh, really?

1249
01:34:18,481 --> 01:34:21,120
Speaking of which,
I'd like to ask you a favour.

1250
01:34:21,281 --> 01:34:22,873
Your ladyship commands.

1251
01:34:23,681 --> 01:34:27,037
Could you look for "The Cats" for me.

1252
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:28,874
In the courtyard?

1253
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:32,795
No. The book by Fialho.
The novel, "The <i>Cats".</i>

1254
01:34:33,561 --> 01:34:35,916
I thought it was the mewing "cats"!

1255
01:34:36,081 --> 01:34:39,437
- Mrs. Mafalda, it's time.
- To tell you the truth,

1256
01:34:39,601 --> 01:34:43,913
I don't need any more medicines.
You can take this too.

1257
01:34:44,281 --> 01:34:49,401
I feel I've gone back 30 years.

1258
01:35:54,561 --> 01:35:57,712
As handsome as 30 years ago.

1259
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:19,396
Honestly, I don't know why you didn't
visit André straight away.

1260
01:36:19,561 --> 01:36:23,190
- Was it because of the typist?
- You know nothing of psychology.

1261
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,921
Did you want me to visit him
while he was delirious,

1262
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:28,914
so I could be thrown out
with the usual remark:

1263
01:36:29,081 --> 01:36:32,710
"The Doctor does not allow visitors",
which she'd tell me on the phone.

1264
01:36:32,881 --> 01:36:34,633
And will she say so in person?

1265
01:36:34,801 --> 01:36:37,679
No. he'll have to see me now,
whether he wants to or not.

1266
01:36:37,841 --> 01:36:41,311
I swear that girl
is going to pay dearly for this.

1267
01:36:41,481 --> 01:36:43,631
I'll stab her in public!

1268
01:36:43,961 --> 01:36:47,795
That's a bit much.
Revenge is very ugly.

1269
01:36:47,961 --> 01:36:51,590
Yes, it is. But it feels good.

1270
01:36:54,961 --> 01:36:57,998
They all say I'm a loser

1271
01:36:59,521 --> 01:37:03,070
But the one to lose

1272
01:37:07,641 --> 01:37:09,472
Lose...

1273
01:37:09,641 --> 01:37:13,395
Mr. José, do me a favour
and call 47273.

1274
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:16,515
7-3. Thank you.

1275
01:37:17,441 --> 01:37:19,511
Somebody lost...

1276
01:37:19,921 --> 01:37:21,877
Lose...

1277
01:37:22,321 --> 01:37:24,073
Bruise...

1278
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:26,438
Die...

1279
01:37:26,721 --> 01:37:28,200
<i>I..."l"?</i>

1280
01:37:28,361 --> 01:37:31,478
Hello? Who's speaking?

1281
01:37:31,841 --> 01:37:34,992
'Gruta do Fado'? Costa here.

1282
01:37:35,881 --> 01:37:37,633
Costa do Castelo.

1283
01:37:37,801 --> 01:37:39,951
Yes? How are you?

1284
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:45,839
Could you tell Rosa Maria
I'm sending her another song today.

1285
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:49,950
Yes. I'm working
on the finishing touches.

1286
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:52,832
The finishing touches.

1287
01:37:53,281 --> 01:37:56,990
You won't forget?
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1288
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:12,713
Simplício... It's you...
This all seems like a dream.

1289
01:38:12,881 --> 01:38:17,033
I should say so...
What a meal! What a cigar!

1290
01:38:17,201 --> 01:38:19,635
I haven't enjoyed this good fortune
for a long time...

1291
01:38:19,801 --> 01:38:23,271
It's so long since
I last had bicarbonate...

1292
01:38:26,681 --> 01:38:31,835
What are you writing? Poetry?
You're still the same poet.

1293
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:34,390
- Let me read them.
- They're not important.

1294
01:38:34,561 --> 01:38:37,155
I was only daydreaming.

1295
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:39,881
"They all say I'm a loser,

1296
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:43,954
"but the one to lose
the best in life

1297
01:38:44,121 --> 01:38:47,113
"was no-one else but <i>me".</i>

1298
01:38:47,561 --> 01:38:49,199
How fantastic!

1299
01:38:49,361 --> 01:38:53,070
You can't deny this poem
was inspired by me.

1300
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:56,557
- By you? But it says <i>"lost".</i>
- So what?

1301
01:38:56,721 --> 01:38:59,519
Was I not lost for 30 years?

1302
01:39:00,881 --> 01:39:05,557
"But the one to lose
the best in life",

1303
01:39:05,721 --> 01:39:08,360
which is you, "was <i>me".</i>

1304
01:39:09,241 --> 01:39:13,200
- Do you think I don't understand?
- Yes, in truth...

1305
01:39:13,361 --> 01:39:17,274
- Who's lost what I've found?
- You're not looking at these.

1306
01:39:17,601 --> 01:39:20,832
- They're going into the memory safe.
- Little Mafalda, don't disgrace me.

1307
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:22,753
- I can't lose that.
- Why not?

1308
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:23,990
Because I don't have another one

1309
01:39:24,161 --> 01:39:25,719
and I have to rewrite them.
- No.

1310
01:39:25,881 --> 01:39:30,113
But I'd like to include some roses.
I know you like flowers so much.

1311
01:39:30,281 --> 01:39:34,194
Then, include a butterfly
kissing it, too.

1312
01:39:34,721 --> 01:39:39,431
A butterfly, I wish.
And you, a rose to adorn.

1313
01:39:39,721 --> 01:39:42,997
So that at the height of Spring
I can, at last, kiss you.

1314
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:47,956
What a pity it's not Spring yet.

1315
01:39:53,961 --> 01:39:56,759
Miss Isabel Castelar is downstairs.

1316
01:39:58,961 --> 01:40:03,034
Oh, bother! Tell her...
Wait. Don't tell her anything.

1317
01:40:03,241 --> 01:40:06,836
Tell Mr. André and Don Simão.
I'll be down in a moment.

1318
01:40:07,041 --> 01:40:09,077
Yes, my lady.

1319
01:40:11,201 --> 01:40:14,432
That's all I needed!
What a nuisance.

1320
01:40:14,601 --> 01:40:15,920
Some creditor?

1321
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:18,436
I mean... Some salesperson?

1322
01:40:18,601 --> 01:40:21,991
No, it's Isabel de Castelar.
An intriguer.

1323
01:40:22,161 --> 01:40:24,152
She's definitely not here
for a good reason.

1324
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:27,472
- Is she young or old?
- She's young and ambitious

1325
01:40:27,641 --> 01:40:31,873
and she's after André's fortune.
- Oh, is she? Leave her to me.

1326
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:33,440
- To you?
- Yes.

1327
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:35,239
From now on I'll be here
standing guard,

1328
01:40:35,401 --> 01:40:38,950
to solve this
and other family problems!

1329
01:40:39,161 --> 01:40:44,315
Standing guard...
Just like Camões,

1330
01:40:44,761 --> 01:40:47,673
a poet and a soldier.

1331
01:40:48,641 --> 01:40:50,359
But this is amazing, Firmino!

1332
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:53,991
Flowers everywhere,
an open piano, and wide open windows.

1333
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:57,710
This is nothing, Miss Isabel.
Ever since Luisinha arrived,

1334
01:40:57,881 --> 01:41:01,590
this house has had a real turnabout.
- Ah yes, the nurse.

1335
01:41:01,841 --> 01:41:04,116
- And then, there's Mr. Costa.
- Mr. Costa?

1336
01:41:04,281 --> 01:41:07,557
Yes, Miss, Mr. Costa.
The librarian...

1337
01:41:07,881 --> 01:41:12,716
He is amazing.
He's been straightening everything out.

1338
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:15,196
Oh, really? Big news, Firmino.

1339
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:18,797
Mrs. Mafalda is 20 years younger.

1340
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:23,240
- Hello, Isabel.
- Well, André? What's happened?

1341
01:41:24,361 --> 01:41:27,558
- Look at you, poor thing.
- Still very weak.

1342
01:41:27,721 --> 01:41:29,359
Sit down, sit down.

1343
01:41:30,321 --> 01:41:33,711
- Thank you.
- I would have come to see you before

1344
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:38,353
were it not for the "doctor's <i>orders".</i>
- That's not for us.

1345
01:41:38,521 --> 01:41:41,991
You were, as they say, unavailable.
Or rather <i>"hostage".</i>

1346
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:46,393
Oh, yes, and the girl? I've really
laughed at such a story.

1347
01:41:47,321 --> 01:41:50,119
A real fairy tale.

1348
01:41:50,281 --> 01:41:53,034
A prince marrying a shepherdess.

1349
01:41:54,081 --> 01:41:57,756
But where is she?
I want to meet such a beauty.

1350
01:41:58,121 --> 01:42:01,397
You'll soon have that pleasure.
She's getting cigarettes from my room

1351
01:42:01,561 --> 01:42:03,836
- She runs errands, too?
- Yes, yes.

1352
01:42:04,001 --> 01:42:05,639
Look, here she is.

1353
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:10,957
- Your cigarette case Mr. André.
- Thank you.

1354
01:42:11,121 --> 01:42:13,316
- Ma'am.
- Goodbye.

1355
01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:16,513
You know, you need to get some air.
Tomorrow I'm coming to get you

1356
01:42:16,681 --> 01:42:19,070
and take you for a drive.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1357
01:42:19,241 --> 01:42:21,835
But I still don't have
the doctor's permission.

1358
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:24,390
- Then I'll have tea with you.
- I can't either.

1359
01:42:24,561 --> 01:42:27,951
At that time I'll be resting my leg.

1360
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:30,396
- Won't I?
- Yes, yes.

1361
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,314
So what?
You can drink tea in any position.

1362
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,312
The Chinese drink it crouching.

1363
01:42:35,481 --> 01:42:38,553
Yes, but I still can't do
such acrobats.

1364
01:42:38,761 --> 01:42:40,797
Ah, I understand.

1365
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:43,998
You're worried in case
your nurse doesn't approve.

1366
01:42:44,521 --> 01:42:48,230
- But surely she won't be jealous.
- Me?!

1367
01:42:48,561 --> 01:42:50,756
- Oh, Isabel!
- Furthermore,

1368
01:42:50,921 --> 01:42:54,880
you know I have special rights
over you.

1369
01:42:55,041 --> 01:42:57,509
- Please don't go on.
- Okay, alright!

1370
01:42:57,881 --> 01:43:02,272
I'll say no more. Don't get worked up
you might get worse.

1371
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:04,113
Excuse me.

1372
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:08,953
- You're satisfied now, aren't you?
- Satisfied...

1373
01:43:09,121 --> 01:43:11,555
No, I'm not satisfied yet.

1374
01:43:22,641 --> 01:43:25,713
- Oh, look, our dear Isabel.
- My lady.

1375
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:29,840
- So, what brings you here?
- Two very important matters.

1376
01:43:30,001 --> 01:43:32,674
First, to see our André,
who's fine.

1377
01:43:32,841 --> 01:43:36,595
- I can see he's been well cared for.
- By the nurse. In my opinion.

1378
01:43:36,761 --> 01:43:38,080
Too?

1379
01:43:38,241 --> 01:43:42,075
Let me introduce you
to Mr. Simplício Costa,

1380
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:46,957
Our new librarian.
Isabelinha Vila Chã.

1381
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:52,794
Costa? I think I've heard the name.
But I know so many Costas.

1382
01:43:52,961 --> 01:43:57,113
You do? I know many 'villas', too.
Vila Pouca, Vila Verde, Vila Franca.

1383
01:43:57,441 --> 01:43:59,716
Vila Chã,
I must confess I did not know.

1384
01:43:59,881 --> 01:44:02,031
But I am Vila Chã "OF" Castelar.

1385
01:44:02,201 --> 01:44:06,399
- And I am Costa "OF" the Castelo.
- Castelo, Castelar...

1386
01:44:06,641 --> 01:44:09,553
- Who knows you might be related?
- Maybe.

1387
01:44:09,721 --> 01:44:12,394
- Do you any Castelars?
- Castelar?

1388
01:44:12,561 --> 01:44:14,995
- Castelar... yes, I know the buns.
- The buns?

1389
01:44:15,161 --> 01:44:19,359
Yes, the buns "OF" Castelar.
They're quite delicious.

1390
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:20,840
- Have you never tried them?
- Excuse me,

1391
01:44:21,001 --> 01:44:25,392
it's a surname from the old cavalry!
- And this is from the old bakery.

1392
01:44:25,561 --> 01:44:29,759
But, tell me, what other reason
is there for your visit?

1393
01:44:29,921 --> 01:44:33,277
Oh, yes. I almost forgot.

1394
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:37,195
I've come to invite you for dinner
at my house next Thursday.

1395
01:44:37,361 --> 01:44:40,797
I want to celebrate
André's recovery in proper style.

1396
01:44:40,961 --> 01:44:43,270
- What a nice gesture.
- You're very kind.

1397
01:44:43,441 --> 01:44:45,750
I hope you won't say no to this.

1398
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:48,389
And I want the girl to go too,
she's been so dedicated.

1399
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:53,112
She's been a darling.
Hasn't she, Mr. Costa?

1400
01:44:53,281 --> 01:44:57,240
A real darling!
Not that you're not, of course.

1401
01:44:57,441 --> 01:44:59,636
But seriously,
do you want Luisinha to go?

1402
01:44:59,801 --> 01:45:03,714
Of course. We cannot celebrate
the cure and forget the remedy.

1403
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:05,792
It's not a meal,
it's more like an operation.

1404
01:45:05,961 --> 01:45:09,476
There's the nurse, the patient,
the chemist...

1405
01:45:09,641 --> 01:45:13,236
And the surgeon - you.
And why not invite

1406
01:45:13,401 --> 01:45:17,394
Mr. Costa "of" the Castle.
- Oh, ma'am.

1407
01:45:17,841 --> 01:45:20,560
Won't I be one too many?

1408
01:45:22,161 --> 01:45:25,358
It's the disappointment that's
the hardest to bear.

1409
01:45:28,121 --> 01:45:31,477
But I'll get over it, Ma Rita.
It'll take time but I'll get over it.

1410
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:35,429
- We should never have come.
- You, too? Don't whine, man!

1411
01:45:35,601 --> 01:45:38,638
We haven't signed anything.
Let's go and that's it.

1412
01:45:38,801 --> 01:45:42,271
Stop thinking about it. We'll be
sleeping at home this very evening.

1413
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:43,874
Alright, Mama Rita.

1414
01:45:44,041 --> 01:45:46,316
But I've still a couple of words
to say to that lady.

1415
01:45:46,481 --> 01:45:48,312
Be careful, child.
Think of Mr. André.

1416
01:45:48,481 --> 01:45:50,915
I don't care about him now,
it's my self-respect.

1417
01:45:51,081 --> 01:45:53,037
After all,
they're both laughing at me.

1418
01:45:53,201 --> 01:45:55,157
You have no reason to speak
like that of Mr. André.

1419
01:45:55,321 --> 01:45:57,391
Maybe, but I'd rather
get used to the idea.

1420
01:45:57,561 --> 01:46:00,951
That Miss Isabel will soon
find out who I am!

1421
01:46:08,681 --> 01:46:11,354
- Miss Isabel!
- Are you having dinner at my place?

1422
01:46:11,521 --> 01:46:14,160
- Yes, but I'd like to say...
- Oh, my head,

1423
01:46:14,321 --> 01:46:16,277
I almost forgot the photo I brought
for André.

1424
01:46:16,441 --> 01:46:18,591
- Yes, but...
- Luisinha, would you be a darling

1425
01:46:18,761 --> 01:46:21,036
and give it to him.
- Me?

1426
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:23,556
It's in my car. Come with me.

1427
01:46:27,841 --> 01:46:30,355
Goodbye, Firmino.
You look younger every day.

1428
01:46:39,921 --> 01:46:43,391
Forgive me, Luisinha, but had I known
you were fond of André,

1429
01:46:43,561 --> 01:46:45,791
I wouldn't have been so cruel
as to say we were engaged.

1430
01:46:45,961 --> 01:46:47,633
But who told you
I am fond of Mr. André?

1431
01:46:47,801 --> 01:46:48,870
Oh, you're not?

1432
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:51,632
Just as well, then.

1433
01:46:51,801 --> 01:46:54,713
If you don't mind...
Give it to André, will you?

1434
01:46:57,561 --> 01:47:00,314
- I look good, don't I?
- No, on the contrary.

1435
01:47:00,481 --> 01:47:03,518
I think you look so ugly I don't have
the heart to give it to Mr. André.

1436
01:47:03,681 --> 01:47:04,955
Excuse me!

1437
01:47:25,441 --> 01:47:30,276
- Isabelinha left in such a fury.
- Well, Mr. Costa didn't spare her.

1438
01:47:30,441 --> 01:47:33,638
I realized she intended
to make fun of Luisinha.

1439
01:47:33,801 --> 01:47:35,598
Even that business of dinner
smells fishy.

1440
01:47:35,761 --> 01:47:36,989
- Do you think so?
- I'm sure.

1441
01:47:37,161 --> 01:47:40,631
All the Vila Chãs and the Castelars
must be there.

1442
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:43,156
- To pick on the poor child!
- That's something she's capable of.

1443
01:47:43,321 --> 01:47:44,993
Yes, but the game might cost her.

1444
01:47:45,161 --> 01:47:48,995
A scandal? That's what she wants.
We'd best get rid of her

1445
01:47:49,161 --> 01:47:53,234
before she spreads her poison.
- Get rid of her? That's difficult.

1446
01:47:53,401 --> 01:47:57,110
- We'd need an excuse.
- Oh, yes? I'm sure we can find one.

1447
01:47:57,281 --> 01:47:59,397
- But how?
- I have a plan,

1448
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:04,437
but don't ask me anything else
for the time being. All I can say is...

1449
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:08,913
...Isabel, you're mine!

1450
01:48:16,001 --> 01:48:17,673
- Well, hello there!
- Good afternoon.

1451
01:48:17,841 --> 01:48:19,672
Good afternoon, Don Simão.

1452
01:48:20,801 --> 01:48:23,998
- What's up then?
- Nothing, we're leaving.

1453
01:48:24,401 --> 01:48:26,790
- What, you're leaving?
- Yes.

1454
01:48:27,321 --> 01:48:29,994
The house is there all empty
getting full of dust.

1455
01:48:30,401 --> 01:48:32,392
- Is that why?
- And also because

1456
01:48:32,561 --> 01:48:34,711
my business will go to the dogs.

1457
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:40,314
But what does this mean, Luisinha?
You're leaving?

1458
01:48:40,481 --> 01:48:44,440
Yes. Our mission in this house
is over. Mr. André has recovered.

1459
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:47,752
- There's something going on here.
- It's just not that...

1460
01:48:47,921 --> 01:48:51,755
Could you please tell Mrs. Mafalda
and all the others

1461
01:48:51,921 --> 01:48:54,594
that we are very grateful
for their kind hospitality.

1462
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:56,638
Goodbye, Don Simão.

1463
01:49:01,921 --> 01:49:05,277
But this isn't right.
You're going just like that?

1464
01:49:05,441 --> 01:49:08,353
Yes, Don Simão.
Just as we came.

1465
01:49:08,521 --> 01:49:11,638
- A very good afternoon.
- Till we meet again, Don Simão.

1466
01:49:39,161 --> 01:49:40,913
- Well?
- Three quarters of an hour?

1467
01:49:41,081 --> 01:49:43,515
- I should have gone there myself!
- I think so too!

1468
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:51,074
Please, stop it for a while, sister.

1469
01:49:51,241 --> 01:49:53,630
- You look like a tiger in a cage.
- Don't irritate me!

1470
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:57,271
Don't irritate me or you will see
a tiger... but out free!

1471
01:49:57,681 --> 01:50:00,832
- Well? They're not coming yet?
- No sign.

1472
01:50:01,801 --> 01:50:04,759
All we need now
is for him to stay there, too.

1473
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:06,679
That would be a relief.

1474
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:09,509
For me, for the wines
and for the smoked ham.

1475
01:50:09,681 --> 01:50:12,559
Don't say that brother!
How can you?

1476
01:50:12,721 --> 01:50:15,281
How can I allow such abuse?

1477
01:50:15,441 --> 01:50:18,751
After all, I haven't been Don Simão!
I've been the grocery

1478
01:50:18,921 --> 01:50:20,513
'Jerónimo Martins and <i>Sons'.</i>
- Here he comes!

1479
01:50:21,121 --> 01:50:23,589
- Good!
- Bad, I say!

1480
01:50:51,561 --> 01:50:53,711
- Well?
- There's nothing we can do.

1481
01:50:54,441 --> 01:50:56,318
But did you tell her it was I
who was asking her to come?

1482
01:50:56,481 --> 01:50:58,756
It's useless.
She's locked herself in her room

1483
01:50:58,921 --> 01:51:02,914
and neither Januário nor Ma Rita
can get her to at least speak to me.

1484
01:51:03,401 --> 01:51:07,314
"No, no, and <i>no"...</i>
She's very hurt.

1485
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:09,836
- But why?
- Hurt? I don't understand!

1486
01:51:10,001 --> 01:51:12,390
I do.
This was Miss Isabel's doing.

1487
01:51:12,561 --> 01:51:15,200
Is there no way we can get out
of this situation?

1488
01:51:15,361 --> 01:51:18,831
Yes, there is. Give me a free hand,
and I'll put everything to rights.

1489
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:20,514
Free hand?

1490
01:51:20,801 --> 01:51:23,315
- Is there anything else you want?
- Be quiet, brother!

1491
01:51:23,761 --> 01:51:27,879
- Go on my friend.
- Let me tell you.

1492
01:51:28,601 --> 01:51:30,557
The one going to Luisinha's house now

1493
01:51:30,721 --> 01:51:33,474
is Mr. André.
- Me? No.

1494
01:51:34,161 --> 01:51:37,392
If she hasn't acknowledged my request
I will not insist anymore.

1495
01:51:37,601 --> 01:51:41,116
I have my self-respect, too.
Why lower myself? What have I done?

1496
01:51:41,281 --> 01:51:44,557
- Hear, hear!
- This is nothing to do with you.

1497
01:51:44,721 --> 01:51:46,996
- You listen and be quiet.
- Hear, hear.

1498
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:51,956
God knows, I'm very sorry, but
this is what she wants. I give up.

1499
01:51:52,161 --> 01:51:56,518
You give up, do you?
So, Miss Isabel has the last laugh?

1500
01:51:56,681 --> 01:51:59,115
No. I'll teach that bird a lesson.

1501
01:51:59,281 --> 01:52:02,034
You?
You gave you license?

1502
01:52:02,201 --> 01:52:05,398
- No-one. I licensed myself.
- I'm on your side.

1503
01:52:05,561 --> 01:52:09,998
I had already noticed
you are a daring gentleman.

1504
01:52:10,241 --> 01:52:13,153
Well said.
The noble stock of the Costas

1505
01:52:13,321 --> 01:52:16,916
has never turned their back
on anyone, whoever they might be.

1506
01:52:17,521 --> 01:52:19,637
Luisinha will see me tomorrow,

1507
01:52:19,801 --> 01:52:23,157
even if I have to use brute force.

1508
01:52:42,441 --> 01:52:48,835
Oh, how I longed for
My happy little house

1509
01:52:49,001 --> 01:52:53,153
As modest as myself

1510
01:52:55,521 --> 01:53:01,869
Oh, Lord it is so good to live
On the first floor,

1511
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:06,876
Counting from the heavens down

1512
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:15,520
My bedroom is like a nest
And the ceiling is so low

1513
01:53:15,681 --> 01:53:20,835
That when I lie down,

1514
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:30,275
I discreetly open the door
And always say

1515
01:53:30,761 --> 01:53:35,391
Mister ceiling,

1516
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:41,552
Please let me come in

1517
01:53:44,841 --> 01:53:52,395
The noble or the rich
Everything they have

1518
01:53:54,841 --> 01:54:01,519
But the home of the poor

1519
01:54:04,361 --> 01:54:08,877
Has more joy

1520
01:54:22,521 --> 01:54:29,393
But the home of the poor

1521
01:54:33,641 --> 01:54:38,112
Has more joy

1522
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:51,674
- Luisinha...
- Don't go on, Ma Rita.

1523
01:54:51,841 --> 01:54:53,797
I've told you
I don't want to see him again.

1524
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:55,758
But Mr. Costa
has never done us any wrong!

1525
01:54:55,921 --> 01:54:57,593
On the contrary.

1526
01:55:14,521 --> 01:55:17,274
I'd like to speak to Miss Luisinha.

1527
01:55:20,361 --> 01:55:21,953
It's from the bank!

1528
01:55:22,401 --> 01:55:25,393
From the bank? Who is it?

1529
01:55:31,761 --> 01:55:35,515
At last, I've got you!

1530
01:55:41,641 --> 01:55:46,237
And now, Luisinha,
you have to listen to me.

1531
01:55:48,201 --> 01:55:49,793
You'd better come in, then.

1532
01:55:54,601 --> 01:55:56,671
Well, Mr. Januário?
Did I or didn't I do it?

1533
01:55:56,841 --> 01:56:00,197
- You're a sly one!
- As sly as a fox!

1534
01:56:00,641 --> 01:56:02,552
My dear Luisinha...

1535
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:06,281
...I've come here...
- I can guess, Mr. Costa,

1536
01:56:06,441 --> 01:56:10,320
but I can tell you there's no point
in talking about such matters.

1537
01:56:11,601 --> 01:56:13,398
Look, Luisinha, I've come here,

1538
01:56:13,561 --> 01:56:16,758
because, above all,
I am a man with a heart.

1539
01:56:16,921 --> 01:56:18,957
If you only knew the sadness
there is in that house

1540
01:56:19,121 --> 01:56:21,157
since you left, Luisinha...

1541
01:56:21,361 --> 01:56:24,319
Poor André doesn't even seem
the same.

1542
01:56:24,681 --> 01:56:26,353
Poor thing.

1543
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:30,840
I know you're suffering too, Luisa.
You suffer because you love him too.

1544
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:34,914
Me?! Yes, I did love him.
I loved him when he was Daniel.

1545
01:56:35,201 --> 01:56:38,238
But André? That two-faced?
That hypocrite?

1546
01:56:38,561 --> 01:56:42,110
Well, well...
It's obvious you don't love him.

1547
01:56:42,401 --> 01:56:45,996
But in that case,
you're not afraid of going back.

1548
01:56:46,161 --> 01:56:47,640
No, no and no!

1549
01:56:47,801 --> 01:56:51,396
What for? For more disappointments?
More suffering?

1550
01:56:51,561 --> 01:56:53,472
Come on, Luisinha...

1551
01:56:53,641 --> 01:56:57,429
I've already said I don't want to!
No-one can make me see him!

1552
01:56:57,961 --> 01:56:59,792
I can, Luisinha.

1553
01:56:59,961 --> 01:57:01,792
My lady!

1554
01:57:16,388 --> 01:57:18,948
"to a fancy dress party
taking place in her Gardens

1555
01:57:19,068 --> 01:57:20,626
"next Wednesday, 3rd,

1556
01:57:20,748 --> 01:57:24,058
"to celebrate André's <i>recovery."</i>

1557
01:58:13,388 --> 01:58:14,867
Look. Here she is.

1558
01:58:15,028 --> 01:58:18,020
- And very pretty!
- It's symbolic.

1559
01:58:18,188 --> 01:58:21,339
It means her reign
is coming to a bad end.

1560
01:58:24,068 --> 01:58:25,706
Here's the roll.

1561
01:58:25,828 --> 01:58:27,944
When I give the sign, like this...

1562
01:58:28,148 --> 01:58:30,184
- The false notes.
- Yes, Mr. Costa.

1563
01:58:30,348 --> 01:58:31,861
- O...
<i>...</i> K.

1564
01:58:36,988 --> 01:58:39,138
Luisinha! Luisinha!

1565
01:58:48,588 --> 01:58:50,226
We're all waiting.

1566
01:58:50,388 --> 01:58:54,347
How beautiful, Juliet!
Romeo will be dizzy.

1567
01:58:54,548 --> 01:58:57,665
- Mr. Costa, I'm so nervous.
- Chin up!

1568
01:58:57,788 --> 01:59:02,384
The time for revenge has come.
And Isabelinha will soon be sweating!

1569
01:59:08,668 --> 01:59:12,547
So, are you cured of your typing?

1570
01:59:12,788 --> 01:59:15,427
Completely cured.
On revient toujours.

1571
01:59:16,868 --> 01:59:19,223
And is this why
you wanted me to come?

1572
01:59:19,348 --> 01:59:23,023
Calm down, Juliet.
That's the rope ladder,

1573
01:59:23,348 --> 01:59:26,420
that Romeo will climb
to reach your balcony.

1574
01:59:36,788 --> 01:59:39,256
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1575
01:59:39,388 --> 01:59:43,267
Ms. Isabel de Vila Chã
e Castelar, here present,

1576
01:59:43,508 --> 01:59:48,343
will sing one of her noted songs
for the first time.

1577
01:59:50,708 --> 01:59:53,780
Will you excuse me?
Luisinha, come with me, please.

1578
02:00:01,348 --> 02:00:04,340
Poor Marie Antoniette...
She's climbed the scaffold.

1579
02:00:29,348 --> 02:00:32,420
On a river

1580
02:00:33,188 --> 02:00:37,022
Of a dream of love

1581
02:00:38,748 --> 02:00:42,138
A

1582
02:00:42,348 --> 02:00:46,421
Princess kissed

1583
02:00:47,988 --> 02:00:53,745
A ministrel

1584
02:00:54,068 --> 02:00:57,902
And never came back

1585
02:00:58,668 --> 02:01:03,219
And her heart took

1586
02:01:05,228 --> 02:01:09,904
The moon, something rare

1587
02:01:10,148 --> 02:01:14,027
From her toast she smiles

1588
02:01:14,708 --> 02:01:18,940
She had cruelly sworn

1589
02:01:19,228 --> 02:01:23,540
Her dream she betrayed

1590
02:01:24,868 --> 02:01:26,984
Come here, Luisinha.
Get ready.

1591
02:01:27,108 --> 02:01:29,019
But will I be singing like this,
dressed up as Juliet?

1592
02:01:29,148 --> 02:01:32,299
Don't worry,
we'll soon change you into a Juliana.

1593
02:01:32,468 --> 02:01:36,700
Look, this goes down.
This goes up.

1594
02:01:44,468 --> 02:01:46,026
"Song from the <i>Street".</i>

1595
02:01:48,668 --> 02:01:53,025
How horrible, they'll run away.

1596
02:01:57,668 --> 02:02:01,547
"Go get undressed!"

1597
02:02:02,988 --> 02:02:08,346
Song from the street

1598
02:02:09,348 --> 02:02:12,420
Different from the others

1599
02:02:12,668 --> 02:02:19,062
Neither yours nor mine,
It belongs to everyone

1600
02:02:19,468 --> 02:02:25,703
Song from the street,
To and fro it goes, never stopping

1601
02:02:26,188 --> 02:02:32,582
Fickle and insane,
From mouth to mouth, it is no-one's

1602
02:02:33,148 --> 02:02:39,587
Song from the street,
Swift swallow

1603
02:02:39,908 --> 02:02:46,256
It cannot be yours,
And will not be mine

1604
02:02:46,828 --> 02:02:53,267
The song from the street
Cannot remain on anyone's lips

1605
02:02:53,548 --> 02:02:58,576
Independent, to all it belongs
It belongs to no-one

1606
02:02:58,708 --> 02:03:02,064
Song from the street...

1607
02:03:02,548 --> 02:03:05,221
Only words about us

1608
02:03:05,468 --> 02:03:08,141
When it possesses...

1609
02:03:12,628 --> 02:03:18,783
Song from the street,
To and fro it goes, never stopping

1610
02:03:19,588 --> 02:03:25,026
Fickle and insane,
From mouth to mouth, it is no-one's

1611
02:03:26,308 --> 02:03:32,417
When the people's song is heard
Banal, it is thought, and yet

1612
02:03:32,828 --> 02:03:36,184
It smiles at pain itself
In love songs, so they say,

1613
02:03:36,348 --> 02:03:41,024
Deadly destiny
Song from the street,

1614
02:03:41,708 --> 02:03:44,939
Different from the others

1615
02:03:45,228 --> 02:03:51,303
Neither yours nor mine,
To all it belongs

1616
02:03:51,908 --> 02:03:58,507
Song from the street,
To and fro it goes, never stopping

1617
02:03:58,868 --> 02:04:04,022
Fickle and insane,
From mouth to mouth, it is no-one's

1618
02:04:04,188 --> 02:04:10,661
Song from the street,
Different from the others

1619
02:04:10,948 --> 02:04:17,626
Neither yours nor mine,
To all it belongs

1620
02:04:17,868 --> 02:04:24,580
Song from the street,
To and fro it goes, never stopping

1621
02:04:24,788 --> 02:04:30,818
Fickle and insane,
From mouth to mouth, it is no-one's

1622
02:04:55,108 --> 02:04:58,578
Well, what do you think of my idea?
Great, eh?

1623
02:05:00,228 --> 02:05:02,503
Why such faces?

1624
02:05:02,628 --> 02:05:04,505
What? You didn't like it?

1625
02:05:05,548 --> 02:05:07,539
Yes, they did!

1626
02:05:08,068 --> 02:05:11,583
Come with me.
You too, my lady, please.

1627
02:05:32,148 --> 02:05:35,345
Mrs. Rita! Mr. Januário!
Com on up, come on up!

1628
02:05:56,828 --> 02:06:01,265
After the victory, peace.
Go on, explain yourselves.

1629
02:06:01,628 --> 02:06:05,416
There's nothing like a good chat
to reach an understanding.

1630
02:06:05,548 --> 02:06:06,981
Excuse me.

1631
02:06:15,348 --> 02:06:18,226
André, how crazy,
simply crazy I was!

1632
02:06:18,708 --> 02:06:20,141
Luisinha...

1633
02:06:24,948 --> 02:06:27,667
- But what are they doing?
- A tête-ã-tête,

1634
02:06:27,828 --> 02:06:29,739
for the happiness of the four.

1635
02:06:32,188 --> 02:06:34,577
May the Lord help them
reach an understanding!

1636
02:07:11,188 --> 02:07:14,498
- At last!
- What a lovely couple.

1637
02:07:15,108 --> 02:07:17,383
Romeo and Juliet.

1638
02:07:17,708 --> 02:07:21,906
Carmen and Don José. Olé!

1639
02:07:32,508 --> 02:07:38,743
Song from the street,
Different from the others

1640
02:07:38,988 --> 02:07:45,700
Neither yours nor mine,
To all it belongs

1641
02:07:46,468 --> 02:07:53,067
Song from the street,
To and fro it goes, never stopping

1642
02:07:54,028 --> 02:07:59,739
Fickle and insane,
From mouth to mouth, it is no-one's

1643
