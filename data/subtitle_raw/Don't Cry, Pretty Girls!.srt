12
00:02:42,907 --> 00:02:45,045
- Fetch me a white chair.
- A white one?

13
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:46,784
Otherwise I cannot play the cello.

14
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:06,940
I remember, it was so long ago
when the family still lived together

15
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:18,363
In the evenings,
my mother cooked supper for us

16
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,405
We, the children, just kept laughing
and enjoyed the warmth

17
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,842
Some of us asked for a second helping,
not having eaten enough

18
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:52,525
Vanishing smells took off towards the sky

19
00:03:56,978 --> 00:04:03,935
Glittering stars fell down instead of them

20
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,258
- Hello.
- Hi.

21
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:26,657
It has been quite some time
since my good father stood up

22
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:35,050
This must have been a sign...

23
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:36,238
Hey!

24
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,358
Stop playing please.

25
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,304
Thank you.

26
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,716
Let's start the rehearsal.

27
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:49,820
Emese and my mother,
they sat at the piano

28
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:53,208
Let me welcome you
in the name of the performing band.

29
00:04:53,484 --> 00:05:01,137
And in a moment they became lost
in the notes with enthusiasm

30
00:05:05,068 --> 00:05:11,910
Then music started to play

31
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:28,455
Hey!

32
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:29,608
Hey!

33
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:30,862
Boys!

34
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,514
Where are you going? Stop!

35
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:40,565
Come along, boys. The old man
is very cross. Stop fooling around.

36
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,440
Look. There she comes.

37
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:18,687
Count to twenty.

38
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,128
You're aces.

39
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:12,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

40
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:20,052
Hi.

41
00:07:20,463 --> 00:07:21,463
Hello.

42
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:23,887
Come on, let's go.

43
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,895
- Your parents are here?
- Yes.

44
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:30,622
Come on.

45
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,918
- Good day.
- Hello, dear.

46
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:42,955
- Good day.
- Good day.

47
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:51,553
One, two, three...

48
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:54,162
four, five.

49
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:57,891
Thank you.

50
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:07,287
- The man with the rings is here.
- Where?

51
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,046
Outside.
We could arrange things as we agreed.

52
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:15,495
We'd pay for the wedding
and you for the rings.

53
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,667
In four weeks, we could have
the wedding at our house.

54
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,732
- Good day.
- Good day.

55
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:41,512
I've brought the rings.

56
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:43,987
Here they are.

57
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,335
- How much?
- Like I had said. Cheap.

58
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,625
Six hundred.

59
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:53,567
- No tricks?
- It's real gold.

60
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,097
My poor mother wore it.

61
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,102
- Here's her name engraved.
- It's a pity.

62
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,372
- Here you are.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

63
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:07,565
Goodbye.

64
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,042
Goodbye.

65
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:11,892
- Thank you.
- Bye.

66
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,573
- Bye, son.
- Take care.

67
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:50,945
Hey, old man.

68
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:52,337
Are you seeing this?

69
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,690
Pull yourself together, grandpa.
It's your shift.

70
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:56,184
Hey, grandpa.

71
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:59,162
- Hey!
- He's had one too many again.

72
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:01,387
- Leave me alone.
- What will your wife say?

73
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:05,144
Put him under the shower.

74
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,952
Under the shower with him.

75
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,928
Come on, pretty face!

76
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,460
- Don't worry.
- Cold water will do him good.

77
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:15,387
Take off your jacket.

78
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:18,130
- Pull out your arm.
- Can you go to work?

79
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:20,073
- Yes...
- Like hell he could.

80
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,834
- Under the water.
- We'll see to it.

81
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,527
He's completely out of control.

82
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
He's done for.

83
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,587
Come on under the tap, old man.

84
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:37,045
Pull yourself together, old man.

85
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:41,402
Stand here.

86
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,343
Feels good, right?

87
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:50,165
This will do him good!

88
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,691
- Hold his head.
- Let him have it.

89
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,895
Close your eyes and do twenty squats.

90
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,405
- That will do.
- That's enough.

91
00:11:01,155 --> 00:11:02,814
- Old man, was it good?
- No harm done.

92
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,181
- Was it good?
- He'll sober up. All right.

93
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,550
- Hey!
- What is it?

94
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,760
- Water!
- What's happening? Who did this?

95
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,225
- Water!
- Is this a joke?

96
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:18,003
- Water!
- Or beer!

97
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:21,375
- Why do they always turn off the water?
- Was it you?

98
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,978
- I didn't turn it off. It wasn't me.
- Then who was it?

99
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:26,665
- It's the same every day.
- We're here all soaped up.

100
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,635
Let's kick up a row! To the office.

101
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:31,617
Comrade Szegedi?
The water's been turned off...

102
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,505
Hello, give us water.

103
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:35,634
It's been turned off.
No hot or cold water.

104
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,223
We want water!

105
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:43,382
We want water!

106
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:48,340
We want water!

107
00:12:02,403 --> 00:12:05,965
Stars, don't shine

108
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:09,617
Stars, I am going blind

109
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,825
Time passes me by

110
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:19,348
Angels are creeping forth

111
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:24,773
Meteors falling into the depths

112
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:28,605
Beautiful girl, her face has disappeared

113
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,988
Perhaps she was only singing to me

114
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:38,363
I don't know where she went or who she was

115
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:44,652
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

116
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,505
I put down what I'm thinking of

117
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,652
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

118
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:56,435
I put down what I'm thinking of

119
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,249
I'm just doing drawings

120
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:05,595
A tiny man landed on my arm

121
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,442
He asked me what I was looking for

122
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:13,412
I couldn't tell him

123
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:18,902
Though I think it must have been something

124
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:24,569
The wicked dog catcher hid in a cloud

125
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:28,038
He is slyly peeping out from there

126
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,503
People are resting in the sunshine

127
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:37,852
It radiates its warmth on me

128
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:44,192
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

129
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:48,073
I put down what I'm thinking of

130
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:52,122
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

131
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:56,027
I put down what I'm thinking of

132
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,935
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

133
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,872
I put down what I'm thinking of

134
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:07,784
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

135
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:11,624
I put down what I'm thinking of

136
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:15,715
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

137
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,052
No!

138
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,297
No!

139
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,430
No!

140
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:20,638
It's not me!

141
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,927
Not me!

142
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,670
It's not me!

143
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:29,987
This is not me! No, please!

144
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,945
Listen to me.

145
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,790
Listen to me.

146
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:35,387
It is not me.

147
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,885
No!

148
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,089
It's not me!

149
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:42,220
It's not me! No!

150
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:43,627
It's not me!

151
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,318
It's... It's not me.

152
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:50,320
No!

153
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,215
No!

154
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:55,952
It's not me!

155
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,515
At home, you're idle and feel bored

156
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,210
There's not one friend with you

157
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:19,345
We invite you to join us,
we're expecting you

158
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,945
Come along, you mustn't be afraid of us

159
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,292
Come with me, listen to the music

160
00:15:25,562 --> 00:15:27,302
Come with me, listen to the music

161
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,392
And do feel at ease

162
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:33,091
Come with me, listen to the music

163
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,136
Come with me, listen to the music

164
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:38,101
And do feel at ease

165
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:50,105
A shaky house, its big gate is open

166
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,937
Peep in, but don't expect
wonders to happen

167
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,818
You will be welcomed by
a smoky little room

168
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,575
Whoever you may be, no one will hurt you

169
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,183
Come with me, listen to the music

170
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,170
Come with me, listen to the music

171
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:09,310
And do feel at ease

172
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:12,028
Come with me, listen to the music

173
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,023
Come with me, listen to the music

174
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:17,023
And do feel at ease

175
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,872
Some are standing there shocked

176
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:40,595
Some are waiting for lovely girls

177
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,573
Some are just sitting there in silence

178
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,600
Some are looking around
leaning against the wall

179
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,014
Come with me, listen to the music

180
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:52,939
Come with me, listen to the music

181
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,940
And do feel at ease

182
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:58,805
Come with me, listen to the music

183
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,852
Come with me, listen to the music

184
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:03,732
And do feel at ease

185
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,662
Hey, here you are!

186
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:27,343
Down in the valley lived a girl

187
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,220
She wasn't what you'd call a beauty

188
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:35,172
She was an orphan and lonely

189
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:39,117
But her heart was as white as snow

190
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:42,897
After much wandering

191
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:47,060
A vagabond passed her by

192
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:51,050
His torn shirt and shoes

193
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,912
Were accompanied by the sound of a flute

194
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,809
We were going to spend the day together.

195
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,000
You know it.

196
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:10,026
Don't you want to?

197
00:18:13,995 --> 00:18:14,995
Come along.

198
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:22,370
One afternoon, the vagabond

199
00:18:22,663 --> 00:18:26,420
Arrived at the house of the girl

200
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:30,297
He was tired and weary

201
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,443
He asked for some food and drink

202
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,122
The girl told the boy to go inside

203
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:42,268
She made him sit at her table

204
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:46,100
And when evening came

205
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:50,147
She put him in her bed

206
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:54,189
Hello.

207
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,571
Kids, we've found some empty digs.

208
00:18:56,764 --> 00:18:59,073
- Come on.
- It's a swell house. Let's go.

209
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:00,708
Ladies, come on.

210
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:17,707
The vagabond thanked the girl

211
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:21,300
Full of gratitude for the night

212
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,260
The girl said softly

213
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:29,072
"Stay with me forever"

214
00:19:42,498 --> 00:19:45,257
We have solved so many problems

215
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:48,040
We have never been so well off

216
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:51,204
Still, sometimes you can feel it

217
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:54,220
It's annoying that you can't find digs

218
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:02,640
We said you can understand

219
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,090
Let's find a nice little place today

220
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:11,808
Where the neighbor endures us

221
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,510
And the caretaker won't rebuff us

222
00:20:22,592 --> 00:20:26,552
So we, a big family, have found a home

223
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:29,064
It is the concern of all of us

224
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,312
We'd share it with anyone

225
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,820
And the caretaker won't rebuff us

226
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,135
Wild flowers grow up
the walls of the house

227
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:54,442
Happy to live, yes

228
00:20:56,598 --> 00:21:01,395
There's a sign hanging
on the door of our house

229
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:06,174
Nobody disturbs us here

230
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:10,038
We're getting along with the girls

231
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,513
We leave things to them in the kitchen

232
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,801
And if they leave in the morning

233
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:19,994
Hey!

234
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,387
This is my room.

235
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:24,322
Not before we agree to it.

236
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:27,405
Stop making noises or I'll kick you.
Bye.

237
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:04,183
We'd share it with anyone

238
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:09,943
And the caretaker won't rebuff us

239
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,235
Don't bother us
for the next year or two.

240
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:14,588
Okay?

241
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:20,337
Wild flowers grow up
the walls of the house

242
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:24,430
Happy to live, yes

243
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,500
Then why did you come here with me?

244
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:06,902
Good afternoon.

245
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:08,738
- Afternoon.
- Strength and health.

246
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:10,747
- What are you doing here?
- We moved in.

247
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:13,058
What do you mean "We moved in"?

248
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,754
We found these swell digs.

249
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,380
Can't you speak like a normal person?
How many of you are there?

250
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:21,765
Nine.

251
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:24,202
One, two, three.

252
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,303
- And the rest?
- Up there.

253
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,620
Guys, a policeman's here!

254
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:49,903
Come outside.

255
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:04,395
Come outside.

256
00:26:05,827 --> 00:26:06,827
Tell them to come out.

257
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:07,987
- I can't.
- Why?

258
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:09,213
I just can't.

259
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:14,055
- Open up. It's the police.
- Stop messing around, guys.

260
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:17,883
- In the name of the law, open up!
- Go to hell.

261
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:19,944
Open up!

262
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:23,737
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.

263
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:25,094
What are you doing here?

264
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:27,798
Do you really want to know?

265
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:30,370
- Tell her to come outside.
- Juli.

266
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,800
She's my fiancée. Here's the ring.

267
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,732
Now listen. I'll give you one hour.

268
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:39,957
But if I find you here after that
you'll get into big trouble.

269
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:41,403
Understood?

270
00:26:43,276 --> 00:26:44,276
Bye.

271
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,751
You have one hour to get out.

272
00:27:00,825 --> 00:27:03,483
We said you can understand

273
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:06,947
Let's find a nice little place today

274
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:12,628
Where the neighbor endures us

275
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:17,773
One hour.

276
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:19,115
Understood?

277
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:22,296
Understood.

278
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:27,383
So we, a big family, have found a home

279
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,822
We're all in it together

280
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:34,637
We'd share it with anyone

281
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,237
Come on, the cop is back.

282
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:37,582
Great timing.

283
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,799
And the caretaker won't rebuff us.

284
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:51,157
Wild flowers grow up
the walls of the house

285
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:55,575
Happy to live, yes

286
00:27:57,502 --> 00:28:02,315
There's a sign
hanging on the door of our house

287
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,025
Nobody disturbs us here

288
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:11,055
We are getting along well with the girls

289
00:28:11,476 --> 00:28:12,900
Why are you still here?

290
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,135
What if we have no place to go?

291
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:19,117
People, use your brains.

292
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,175
What an idea to move into
a dangerous house like that!

293
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,690
Why? It's empty.

294
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:25,840
Another building
will be built in its place.

295
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:32,885
We'll be back then, remember this.

296
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,862
I gave you one hour.

297
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:40,259
If you don't leave at once,
I'll take you in.

298
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:43,230
I must report you. Understand?
That's not what you want.

299
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:44,850
Get your things and go.

300
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,390
Finished?

301
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:25,611
Yes.

302
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,433
This way, sir.

303
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,035
Pass the ball.

304
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:53,670
He comes from the right.

305
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,810
Jóska, son, fetch some beer.

306
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,895
Beer with beer, as usual.

307
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,795
- Hi.
- Hi.

308
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,767
What's up, girls?

309
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,017
So we, a big family, have found a home

310
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:14,617
We're all in it together

311
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,855
We'd share it with anyone

312
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:25,427
And the caretaker won't rebuff us

313
00:30:30,986 --> 00:30:35,840
Wild flowers grow up
the walls of the house

314
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,214
Happy to live, yes

315
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:46,101
Guys,

316
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,949
I've read in the papers

317
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:51,012
that two girls went to the airport

318
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:54,117
and held up a sign that said
"a kiss for a dollar".

319
00:30:54,928 --> 00:30:56,738
There was a long queue in no time.

320
00:30:57,103 --> 00:31:00,715
- But the police came and drove them away.
- You wouldn't dare do this.

321
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,817
You think? Of course I would.

322
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,652
- You wouldn't.
- Do it right now.

323
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:05,845
Take my hat.

324
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:07,917
Let's see it, come on.

325
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,880
- She will do it!
- At least we'll have money for beer.

326
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:18,946
A kiss for a forint.

327
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,582
A kiss for a forint.

328
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,440
- A kiss for a forint.
- I only have fifty fillérs.

329
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,120
That's a good one.

330
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:30,835
She's pretty.

331
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,427
A kiss for a forint.

332
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:36,073
- A kiss for a forint.
- What? A forint?

333
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,232
Here's your forint.

334
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:42,335
Well, what do you say?

335
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:43,875
A kiss for a forint.

336
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:45,299
A kiss for a forint.

337
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Here you are.

338
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,070
May I?

339
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,748
Oh, no! At just the right time.

340
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:57,725
Here's a twenty,
I buy your stock for today.

341
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,528
Wild flowers grow up
the walls of the house

342
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,008
Happy to live, yes

343
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:16,760
There's a sign
hanging on the door of our house

344
00:32:17,637 --> 00:32:21,665
Nobody disturbs us here

345
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:25,472
We are getting along well with the girls

346
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:29,180
We leave things to them in the kitchen

347
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:34,827
And if they leave in the morning

348
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:36,725
- Good evening.
- Hello, girls.

349
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,040
- You can't come in.
- It's raining.

350
00:32:40,232 --> 00:32:43,180
I don't care.
I'll get into trouble if I let you in.

351
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:44,432
You can't come in.

352
00:32:44,598 --> 00:32:45,887
You're drunk, I can see it.

353
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,623
- Can't you understand?
- You're the one who's drunk, lady!

354
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:52,567
Go away and stop this hooliganism here.
Keep quiet!

355
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,207
Where have you been?

356
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:57,220
- Oh, my hair!
- They're soaking wet.

357
00:32:57,413 --> 00:33:00,195
You're soaking wet, girls.
You're absolutely crazy.

358
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,784
- Your hair is totally wet.
- My shoes are all wet.

359
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:04,702
- You'll catch a cold.
- Come, Juli!

360
00:33:05,257 --> 00:33:07,094
Get changed, quick!

361
00:33:07,582 --> 00:33:09,502
- Come on.
- Water is running down my back.

362
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:11,534
We should have waited under a gutter.

363
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:14,194
- There's alcohol under the coat.
- Don't shout.

364
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:15,449
What do you mean?

365
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:19,038
The old lady told you not to shout.

366
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,344
It's terrible.

367
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,677
Even my sweater is soaking wet.

368
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:35,896
Hi.

369
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:39,553
- Watch out.
- Not so loud.

370
00:33:39,746 --> 00:33:42,605
The old girl is asleep.
She'll wake up and kick up a row.

371
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:43,798
Stop joking.

372
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,950
Stop laughing. Don't you get it?

373
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,975
Hush!

374
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,874
- Kids, there's something wrong.
- Never mind.

375
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:53,192
- She's not asleep.
- Good evening.

376
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:55,403
We were celebrating an engagement.

377
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:57,142
Don't be cross with us.

378
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,052
Are you not ashamed of yourself?

379
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:03,010
- Of what you're doing?
- Why?

380
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:05,590
Four men with two women. Good Lord!

381
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:09,875
- Don't you recognize my sister?
- Anyone can say that. Get out of here.

382
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:12,748
- We're kicked out like dogs.
- Get out. Go!

383
00:34:12,941 --> 00:34:14,135
All right, I'm going.

384
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:17,283
Don't let her overwhelm you.

385
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:19,229
- In we'll go and finish our beer.
- No.

386
00:34:19,422 --> 00:34:22,187
You're already drunk. Go home at once.

387
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,259
- Get out.
- Next time then.

388
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:26,381
- Bye.
- Well, girls, it didn't work out.

389
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:28,218
Get out.

390
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:29,411
- Bye.
- Bye.

391
00:34:29,882 --> 00:34:31,824
We liked her talk, though.

392
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:34,981
- Bye.
- Bye then.

393
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:36,520
Bye, good night!

394
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,430
Boo.

395
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:45,952
You filthy thing!
You try to knife your best pal?

396
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:47,236
You filthy thing!

397
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:51,787
No! Don't kill me! I beg you!

398
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:54,172
I'll do anything you want!

399
00:34:56,773 --> 00:35:00,455
Murderer! Traitor!
You bastard! I'll kill you!

400
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,300
I'll trample you to death!
You bastard! You filthy thing!

401
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:06,167
You damn fag!

402
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,188
I'll tear you to pieces!

403
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:10,765
- I'll rip you apart!
- Don't do that to me, boys.

404
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:14,194
- I'll castrate you! I'll pickle you!
- What will people say?

405
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:16,494
- Don't do that to me.
- You cheat!

406
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:18,437
You'll pay for my sister...

407
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,468
For taking away her innocence!

408
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,784
For staining her sweet, pure life!

409
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:27,193
Don't move or I'll knife you!

410
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:46,253
What is it, Juli?

411
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:53,392
Hi.

412
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:55,753
Climb in.

413
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,492
Are you waiting to be asked?

414
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:42,277
You can wash our things...

415
00:36:48,622 --> 00:36:49,753
since you're here.

416
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,999
Hurry up.

417
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:18,574
What are you thinking about?

418
00:37:23,627 --> 00:37:26,792
The boy who was playing the cello
on the white chair.

419
00:37:29,297 --> 00:37:30,297
That boy?

420
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:31,768
Yes.

421
00:37:32,972 --> 00:37:34,232
What do you think of him?

422
00:37:34,802 --> 00:37:36,550
He played beautifully.

423
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:41,620
I can play like that.

424
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,219
I was also thinking of you.

425
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,667
You'd better have been.

426
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,930
Where is the place where nobody asks you

427
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:16,160
We can start.

428
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:19,812
Why do you live the way you do

429
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:21,809
Is there a place like that?

430
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:23,002
Hi.

431
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:25,777
Stop there.

432
00:38:26,802 --> 00:38:27,802
You, too.

433
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,176
You know you can't go in. You, too.

434
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:36,542
Where is the place
where there are no prejudices

435
00:38:36,735 --> 00:38:40,808
And there are laws only in the hearts

436
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:44,936
All that suits me
doesn't hurt anybody else

437
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,835
There's only peace and no regulations

438
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:01,920
Where's that place?

439
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:06,098
Where's that fort?

440
00:39:06,632 --> 00:39:11,100
Where meaning is more important
than appearances

441
00:39:15,128 --> 00:39:18,690
Where's that place?

442
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:22,725
Where's that fort?

443
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:26,937
Where you are your own master

444
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,245
Girls, there's Géza!

445
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,092
Géza! Come over here!

446
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:32,532
Come over here!

447
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,935
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

448
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:37,535
Come on, girls. Come on, hurry up!

449
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:48,358
Hurry up!

450
00:39:51,184 --> 00:39:52,437
Excuse us.

451
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:55,836
Excuse us.
Let them come in, they're with me.

452
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,642
- We're all with him.
- With Géza.

453
00:39:57,835 --> 00:40:00,251
The guys are outside,
let them come in, too.

454
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:03,712
There they are.

455
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:06,245
- Guys, come up!
- Let the guys come in, too.

456
00:40:07,968 --> 00:40:11,417
Where is that place?

457
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:15,686
Where's that fort?

458
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,585
Where meaning is more important
than appearances

459
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,080
Look, they were smuggled in
and we are just standing here.

460
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,347
Where is that place?

461
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:32,352
Where's that fort?

462
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:36,730
Where you are your own master

463
00:40:43,543 --> 00:40:47,105
Where is the place where nobody asks you

464
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:51,442
Why do you live the way you do

465
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:53,023
Is there a place like that?

466
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,627
Good day. Where are you going?
You can't go in.

467
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,140
Let them in, they are with me.

468
00:40:57,336 --> 00:40:58,475
- All of them?
- Yes.

469
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:08,048
I'd try to find it

470
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,408
I'd try to find it

471
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,784
I'd try to find it

472
00:41:17,355 --> 00:41:19,998
I'd try to find it

473
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:44,764
Want to dance?

474
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:04,547
My coat is torn by the wind

475
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:09,355
The night is too cool for me

476
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:14,855
I pass slowly by them

477
00:42:15,807 --> 00:42:20,450
Their warm voices overtake me laughing

478
00:42:23,238 --> 00:42:26,575
I carry on my way, the wind follows me

479
00:42:27,985 --> 00:42:31,832
Its chilly finger touches my back

480
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:36,946
And asks why it is good that many people

481
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:42,368
Think the same,
yet talk of something else?

482
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,624
Easy girls

483
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:52,047
You must never deny

484
00:42:53,403 --> 00:42:58,155
That your dreams are woven from kisses

485
00:43:35,877 --> 00:43:39,035
Words are the covers of thought

486
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,849
It isn't good to feel ashamed or cold

487
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:49,257
Intentions are wrapped up in word dresses

488
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:55,050
It isn't yet becoming walking around naked

489
00:43:57,216 --> 00:44:00,200
Easy girls

490
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:04,737
I'm fond of you

491
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:10,790
Because you don't wear masks

492
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:40,103
The lyrics to the following two songs
were written by poets:

493
00:44:40,296 --> 00:44:42,210
Miklós Radnóti and Attila József.

494
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,725
When beat music became popular,
we didn't sing much in Hungarian.

495
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:49,538
We just tried to translate the lyrics
of the most popular English songs.

496
00:44:49,965 --> 00:44:54,397
The new Hungarian beat tries to adapt
folk songs and poems for a reason.

497
00:44:55,118 --> 00:44:57,548
Metro's song is an adaptation

498
00:44:57,741 --> 00:45:00,344
of Miklós Radnóti's poem written in 1937

499
00:45:00,548 --> 00:45:03,877
entitled "Marginal note
to the Prophet Habakuk".

500
00:45:04,365 --> 00:45:08,480
Kex' song is an adaptation of
Attila József's poem "With a Pure Heart".

501
00:45:47,532 --> 00:45:49,212
Cities in flames

502
00:45:50,263 --> 00:45:51,717
Villages exploded

503
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,667
Be strict with me, Habakuk

504
00:45:59,915 --> 00:46:02,233
The ember's already cold and black

505
00:46:04,242 --> 00:46:07,435
But within me,
the fiery bite is still burning

506
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:15,123
My food, my drink is bitter

507
00:46:18,655 --> 00:46:21,714
Cover me with soot to my heels,
you, black anger

508
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:54,416
I have neither native sod,

509
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,704
nor a father, mother, god,

510
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,785
cradle gone, the shroud I miss,

511
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,560
lack a lover, lack a kiss.

512
00:47:03,437 --> 00:47:05,222
Three days' hunger, not a bite:

513
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:07,562
nothing heavy, nothing light.

514
00:47:08,054 --> 00:47:10,468
Just on twenty, strong and well,

515
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:13,137
twenty years I'll try to sell.

516
00:47:13,894 --> 00:47:15,776
If a buyer can't be got,

517
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:18,032
let the devil take the lot.

518
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:20,655
Pure at heart, I surely will

519
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,467
break and enter, even kill.

520
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:26,389
They will catch me, I'll be hung,

521
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,762
blessed earth on me be flung,

522
00:47:28,955 --> 00:47:31,278
deadly grasses will then start

523
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,878
growing on my splendid heart.

524
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,737
I have neither native sod,

525
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:55,950
nor a father, mother, god,

526
00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:58,357
cradle gone, the shroud I miss,

527
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,490
lack a lover, lack a kiss.

528
00:48:00,915 --> 00:48:02,744
Three days' hunger, not a bite:

529
00:48:03,135 --> 00:48:04,957
nothing heavy, nothing light.

530
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,304
Just on twenty, strong and well,

531
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,405
twenty years I'll try to sell.

532
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,737
If a buyer can't be got,

533
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:13,940
let the devil take the lot.

534
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:16,204
Pure at heart, I surely will

535
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,469
break and enter, even kill.

536
00:48:18,882 --> 00:48:20,840
They will catch me, I'll be hung,

537
00:48:21,118 --> 00:48:23,060
blessed earth on me be flung,

538
00:48:23,352 --> 00:48:25,295
deadly grasses will then start

539
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:27,394
growing on my splendid heart.

540
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:46,429
Come on.

541
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,287
I'll take you to a cool place.

542
00:48:50,268 --> 00:48:51,332
Will you come with me?

543
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:53,505
I will.

544
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:57,619
She'd tell them to submerge

545
00:48:57,812 --> 00:49:00,410
And watch the crabs making love

546
00:49:00,603 --> 00:49:01,603
Hey.

547
00:49:01,745 --> 00:49:03,212
I can't go alone.

548
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:05,042
Then tell them to come with us.

549
00:49:05,285 --> 00:49:07,962
For what purpose she'd use
the many war devices?

550
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:11,840
She'd say: for any purpose

551
00:49:13,558 --> 00:49:14,937
Well? Are you coming?

552
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,130
Come.

553
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:18,467
If Julia was asked

554
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,217
What is a soldier supposed to do then?

555
00:49:23,538 --> 00:49:25,840
She'd say... But I won't tell you

556
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:29,582
If you want to know, go and ask Julia

557
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,614
I'm sure

558
00:49:33,754 --> 00:49:38,427
Julia doesn't know much
about such complicated things

559
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,147
Still, if I could

560
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:48,019
I would realize all her ideas

561
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:18,745
Perhaps I am growing tired

562
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:22,735
Or the days have grown more burdensome

563
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:27,408
I miss you

564
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:32,177
I could stand more before

565
00:50:32,912 --> 00:50:36,408
My strength is gone

566
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,568
I lived according to my beliefs

567
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:47,515
I was often disappointed

568
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:50,492
But nothing has changed

569
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,590
When there was encouragement

570
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,065
Oh, when you're with me

571
00:50:57,445 --> 00:50:59,668
I don't get tired

572
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:03,017
I've become great for your sake

573
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,845
If that's what I am

574
00:51:06,122 --> 00:51:08,710
If that's what I am

575
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:11,593
If that's what I am

576
00:51:58,377 --> 00:52:00,411
Sorrow is measured by words

577
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:02,893
But their weight has been rubbed away

578
00:52:03,297 --> 00:52:06,769
Still, he who understands
it can see into me

579
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:10,758
You're not angry, I hope.

580
00:52:11,023 --> 00:52:12,023
Why should I be?

581
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:14,390
Why do you put up with it?

582
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:16,808
Come outside.

583
00:52:17,143 --> 00:52:18,143
Come on.

584
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,743
Oh, you must tell me

585
00:52:21,095 --> 00:52:26,057
Why I'm not good enough for you

586
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:35,132
Don't cry, boys

587
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,592
Don't cry, girls

588
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,270
Tears make me shiver

589
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:42,655
I regret being blue

590
00:52:42,963 --> 00:52:44,995
Don't cry, girls

591
00:52:45,603 --> 00:52:47,612
Don't cry, boys

592
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:54,955
You're a nice guy, good-looking, too,

593
00:52:55,148 --> 00:52:57,495
but leave that girl alone
or you'll regret it.

594
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,820
She's his sister and his fiancée.

595
00:53:11,552 --> 00:53:13,488
You'd better forget that chap.

596
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,023
It's we who are taking care of you.
Me and Sour.

597
00:53:17,602 --> 00:53:19,040
You're his fiancée.

598
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:23,407
We got you a place, a job, you've got
everything, what else do you want?

599
00:53:30,363 --> 00:53:31,998
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

600
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:34,982
He who desires goodness for goodness

601
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:36,970
Will soon grow tired of it

602
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:40,936
There are only a few who'll understand
Why he feels sorry

603
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:44,377
And now here I am

604
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:49,270
A broken-down little boy
amongst the grown-ups

605
00:53:57,246 --> 00:53:59,195
Don't cry, girls,

606
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:01,633
Don't cry, boys

607
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:03,158
Hi.

608
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:07,020
- Hi. Were you the one who asked for me?
- Yes.

609
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,074
I'm going to the country with the band.

610
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:14,960
- Will you come with me?
- I can't. I'm working.

611
00:54:18,282 --> 00:54:19,445
You're scared, aren't you?

612
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
I'm not.

613
00:54:23,645 --> 00:54:25,467
- Can't you get some time off?
- No.

614
00:54:26,256 --> 00:54:27,605
Wait, I'll arrange it.

615
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:43,128
Don't cry, girls

616
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:45,737
Don't cry, boys

617
00:54:46,172 --> 00:54:49,570
Oh, no, I didn't deserve it

618
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,940
Oh, no, don't cry, girls

619
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,622
Don't cry, boys

620
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,997
Don't cry, girls

621
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,867
Oh, no

622
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,157
Don't cry, girls

623
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:06,354
Everything's been arranged, come on.

624
00:55:08,132 --> 00:55:10,270
Don't cry, boys

625
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,497
Don't cry, girls

626
00:55:17,718 --> 00:55:20,927
They're waiting for Julia

627
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:24,512
Oh all the boys

628
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:26,994
Who are reading poems

629
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,627
Will understand at last

630
00:55:31,368 --> 00:55:33,977
Oh will understand

631
00:55:37,982 --> 00:55:40,078
Pure love...

632
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:42,265
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, dear.

633
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:44,511
Come.

634
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,448
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

635
00:55:50,628 --> 00:55:51,628
- Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:53,848
- Hi.
- Hi.

637
00:55:58,617 --> 00:55:59,983
- Hi.
- Hi.

638
00:56:00,176 --> 00:56:02,677
- Hello.
- Hi.

639
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,797
- Going somewhere?
- Where are you going?

640
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,405
To the country with the band.
Juli is coming with me.

641
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,895
- This will cause trouble.
- Big trouble.

642
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:12,628
Is Juli going with you?

643
00:56:13,011 --> 00:56:15,148
- She's going away with him.
- She's an idiot.

644
00:56:15,882 --> 00:56:17,548
- Does she want to go?
- Of course.

645
00:56:19,212 --> 00:56:20,647
She'll be beaten to death.

646
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,230
Don't be silly. Who'd do that?

647
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:24,857
- Juli is Sour's fiancée.
- So what?

648
00:56:25,873 --> 00:56:27,800
You know what? Take me instead.

649
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,673
- Not now, but some other time, okay?
- Okay.

650
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:33,170
I'm ready to go.

651
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:41,057
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

652
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,400
- Bye.
- Bye.

653
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:45,198
I've warned you.

654
00:56:57,129 --> 00:57:00,399
A wanderer is strolling along the road

655
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:03,765
And keeps talking, talking of a girl

656
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:06,988
It was not long ago when he said goodbye
and he was asked

657
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:10,370
Will you come again next year, wanderer?

658
00:57:10,563 --> 00:57:13,630
People are passing by

659
00:57:13,918 --> 00:57:16,895
Birds are flying away

660
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:20,240
Clouds are blown away

661
00:57:20,465 --> 00:57:24,035
Hearts are getting cured

662
00:57:29,233 --> 00:57:31,063
Let's stop and give him a lift.

663
00:57:37,718 --> 00:57:38,783
Where do you want to go?

664
00:57:38,963 --> 00:57:41,390
- The next village over.
- Hop on, mate.

665
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:44,235
- Hello.
- Hi.

666
00:57:45,076 --> 00:57:47,565
- Are you musicians?
- Wandering actors.

667
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,179
Wandering actors?
Where are you coming from?

668
00:57:51,372 --> 00:57:54,824
We gave a concert nearby.
Are you hitch-hiking around the country?

669
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:57,263
- Yes.
- And what do you do?

670
00:57:57,525 --> 00:57:58,725
Writing poems.

671
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,442
You? Poems?

672
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:01,905
Yes.

673
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:03,997
- Really?
- Really.

674
00:58:05,505 --> 00:58:07,000
Here's one of my favorite ones.

675
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:10,402
You've placed a wafer-thin moon
in my window

676
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,695
It was white
as it climbed the yawning walls

677
00:58:14,356 --> 00:58:16,290
It got stuck on the shadows of the trees

678
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:18,179
and is now hanging on the branches

679
00:58:18,683 --> 00:58:21,863
It's late, don't go to the meadow,
Trouble is always bound to happen

680
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:24,547
Flower-tusks will hurt your feet

681
00:58:24,795 --> 00:58:27,293
Grass and mud will be covered in blood

682
00:58:27,683 --> 00:58:30,660
You'll be trampled to death
by the growling forest's herd

683
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,342
And the crazy whispering grass
will sting you

684
00:58:34,837 --> 00:58:38,423
Wandering fires will set your hair on fire
Wild dogs will bite you

685
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:41,970
You, who are giving birth to dawns for me

686
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:44,355
And nobody will ever find out

687
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,710
That you've placed a wafer-thin moon
in my window

688
00:59:00,528 --> 00:59:03,115
Once there lived a flower

689
00:59:03,678 --> 00:59:06,519
Lonely, all alone

690
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:09,355
There lived a flower

691
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:14,905
In a pure, blue dress it lived

692
00:59:19,427 --> 00:59:22,160
There came a girl

693
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,420
In a dress as white as snow

694
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:28,344
There came a girl

695
00:59:28,817 --> 00:59:33,535
Lonely, all alone and said

696
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:43,680
Come with me, blue flower

697
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:51,687
Come with me, blue flower

698
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:08,353
Oh dear

699
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:12,575
How could I go with you?

700
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:14,705
In the ground

701
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:20,330
Under bushes I'm living

702
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,485
The lovely girl

703
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,935
Kept asking her for so long

704
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,732
The lovely girl

705
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:39,584
Kept asking her so nicely

706
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:49,850
Come with me, blue flower

707
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:57,915
Come with me, blue flower

708
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,665
Come along, boys.

709
01:01:23,088 --> 01:01:24,088
Come along.

710
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:25,937
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

711
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,783
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

712
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,609
Come again.

713
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:34,112
- Do come again.
- You're always welcome.

714
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:36,462
- Wait for me!
- Come on, Miki.

715
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:38,783
Though we might be
in some other place then.

716
01:01:45,347 --> 01:01:46,347
Bye.

717
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,410
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, guys.

718
01:01:57,883 --> 01:01:59,933
Come on now. Hurry up.

719
01:02:00,126 --> 01:02:03,202
A wanderer is strolling along the road

720
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:06,567
And keeps talking, talking of a girl

721
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:09,129
Bye. Hurry up! Bye.

722
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,152
Will you come again next year, wanderer?

723
01:02:13,413 --> 01:02:16,429
People are passing by

724
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:19,760
Birds are flying away

725
01:02:20,014 --> 01:02:23,067
Clouds are blown away

726
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:26,955
Hearts are getting cured

727
01:02:27,148 --> 01:02:30,244
My heart overflows with you. Hi.

728
01:02:31,143 --> 01:02:32,884
We will play three songs.

729
01:02:33,627 --> 01:02:37,239
"Family", "With a Pure Heart" and "Stars".

730
01:02:37,432 --> 01:02:39,244
I've heard you also do folk songs.

731
01:02:39,437 --> 01:02:41,064
- Everything OK? Can I go?
- You can.

732
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,257
Yes.

733
01:02:42,512 --> 01:02:45,212
- And why?
- Because we like folk songs.

734
01:03:00,528 --> 01:03:07,280
I remember, it was so long ago
when the family still lived together

735
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:18,488
In the evenings,
my mother cooked supper for us

736
01:03:22,907 --> 01:03:30,452
We, the children, just kept laughing
and enjoyed the warmth

737
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:40,850
Some of us asked for a second helping,
not having eaten enough

738
01:03:45,397 --> 01:03:52,577
Vanishing smells took off towards the sky

739
01:03:56,975 --> 01:04:03,740
Glittering stars fell down instead of them

740
01:04:19,563 --> 01:04:26,345
It has been quite some time
since my good father stood up

741
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:36,200
This must have been the sign
to begin the music

742
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:49,420
My sister, Emese, and my mother
they sat at the piano

743
01:04:53,180 --> 01:05:00,515
And in a moment they became lost
in the notes with enthusiasm

744
01:05:04,512 --> 01:05:11,329
And the music chimed

745
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:22,930
I'd gladly fly with it today

746
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:45,495
And the music chimed

747
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:56,763
I'd gladly fly with it today

748
01:06:18,852 --> 01:06:22,596
Stars, don't shine

749
01:06:23,001 --> 01:06:26,256
Stars, I am going blind

750
01:06:26,924 --> 01:06:30,584
Time passes me by

751
01:06:30,974 --> 01:06:36,134
Angels are creeping forth

752
01:06:37,899 --> 01:06:41,664
Meteors falling into the depths

753
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:45,390
Beautiful girl, her face has disappeared

754
01:06:46,015 --> 01:06:49,666
Perhaps she was only singing to me

755
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:55,134
I don't know where she went or who she was

756
01:06:57,512 --> 01:07:00,872
I'm just doing drawings
of what I've dreamt

757
01:07:01,064 --> 01:07:03,111
I'll tear you to pieces, you bastard!

758
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,057
What are you doing? Stop it!

759
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:08,991
Go away. You can't be here.

760
01:07:09,184 --> 01:07:11,084
Run for your lives! No!

761
01:07:11,262 --> 01:07:13,428
- Stop!
- It's not the right place.

762
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,649
Our dear leader!

763
01:07:16,024 --> 01:07:19,018
- What are you doing?
- But gentlemen! This is a stage.

764
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:22,548
I'll beat you!

765
01:07:23,603 --> 01:07:25,064
Jancsi, are you OK?

766
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:26,543
I'm OK, Miklós.

767
01:07:29,723 --> 01:07:31,192
I'll tear your ears off!

768
01:09:08,278 --> 01:09:11,758
When grass and leaves go home

769
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,433
Rivers become green

770
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:17,637
Fish swim there

771
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:21,587
We are flying on in peace

772
01:09:22,228 --> 01:09:24,628
There's an open window

773
01:09:28,655 --> 01:09:32,082
A red bird falling down, its wings tremble

774
01:09:32,824 --> 01:09:35,900
Only the two of you feel sympathy for it

775
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:37,437
It has tripped over

776
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,433
It has fallen down

777
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:41,702
I can go to it

778
01:09:42,335 --> 01:09:45,980
But you carry on running without it

779
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:53,815
Huge violin, green-cloud music

780
01:09:54,475 --> 01:09:57,370
Always nearing and disappearing

781
01:09:57,656 --> 01:09:59,575
With hands wet with tears

782
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:03,662
When you travel on alone

783
01:10:04,232 --> 01:10:06,932
The train slowly stops

784
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:14,117
A red bird falling down, its wings tremble

785
01:10:14,867 --> 01:10:18,047
Only the two of you feel sympathy for it

786
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,470
It has tripped over

787
01:10:20,205 --> 01:10:21,569
It has fallen down

788
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:23,564
I can go to it

789
01:10:25,093 --> 01:10:26,422
You can check for yourself.

790
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,145
The girl is here.

791
01:10:30,232 --> 01:10:32,040
I'll skin the back of this bastard.

792
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:33,572
Don't do anything stupid.

793
01:10:33,765 --> 01:10:34,822
This is so embarrassing.

794
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:36,419
Come on, boys, we're leaving.

795
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,160
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

796
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,435
Have you gone mad, Sour?

797
01:10:45,628 --> 01:10:47,557
We'll punch them twice and take Juli.

798
01:10:47,738 --> 01:10:49,070
No, boys, we can't do that.

799
01:10:49,263 --> 01:10:52,198
- Yes, we can. What are we waiting for?
- Why did we come here then?

800
01:10:52,391 --> 01:10:54,130
- Listen to Kex.
- Don't kick up a row.

801
01:10:58,828 --> 01:11:01,527
If I were you,
I'd have killed the whole gang long ago!

802
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,537
Don't kick up a row. Go home.

803
01:11:03,978 --> 01:11:05,487
- Come on.
- Let's leave here.

804
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,865
He's helpless.

805
01:11:07,038 --> 01:11:08,305
Things are getting bad, Sour.

806
01:11:08,485 --> 01:11:09,737
This is my problem.

807
01:11:10,523 --> 01:11:11,523
All right.

808
01:11:26,096 --> 01:11:27,248
You're a shithead.

809
01:11:31,783 --> 01:11:32,960
Shall I hit you?

810
01:11:36,486 --> 01:11:37,486
Get lost.

811
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:49,703
Silence is getting tired,
it can't overcome the song

812
01:11:49,896 --> 01:11:52,857
That brings back so many happy days

813
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:59,406
Welcome it with smiling faces

814
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:02,158
Girls, don't cry

815
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,937
I know there are vanished dreams

816
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,885
And misunderstood moments

817
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:18,490
But there are real joys awaiting you

818
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:21,609
Girls, don't cry

819
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:28,194
If a shiny promise withers
to become a cheat

820
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:31,825
This is no reason to shed tears

821
01:12:32,104 --> 01:12:35,726
The flowers of the meadow
have withered a thousand times

822
01:12:35,914 --> 01:12:40,422
And new flowers have grown
in their place a thousand times

823
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:45,206
If the sad moment draws to a close

824
01:12:45,432 --> 01:12:48,604
It brings a cheerful day nearer

825
01:12:51,183 --> 01:12:54,746
You are so lovely with smiling eyes

826
01:12:55,062 --> 01:12:57,855
Girls, don't cry

827
01:13:00,814 --> 01:13:04,302
If a shiny promise withers
to become a cheat

828
01:13:04,534 --> 01:13:08,119
This is no reason to shed tears

829
01:13:08,312 --> 01:13:11,979
The flowers of the meadow
have withered a thousand times

830
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:16,651
And new flowers have grown
in their place a thousand times

831
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:21,302
If the sad moment draws to a close

832
01:13:21,603 --> 01:13:24,790
It brings a cheerful day nearer

833
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:30,880
You are so lovely with smiling eyes

834
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,015
Girls, don't cry

835
01:13:35,058 --> 01:13:37,937
Girls, don't cry

836
01:13:38,838 --> 01:13:41,440
Girls, don't cry

837
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:01,577
Are you angry with me?

838
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,400
I am not.

839
01:14:07,756 --> 01:14:09,100
We'd better break up.

840
01:14:11,604 --> 01:14:13,524
Such things can't be forced.

841
01:14:15,715 --> 01:14:17,754
You're young and beautiful.

842
01:14:19,016 --> 01:14:20,075
You should be free.

843
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:23,510
You're right.

844
01:14:29,657 --> 01:14:33,182
Down in the valley lived a girl

845
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:37,015
She wasn't what you'd call a beauty

846
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:40,900
She was an orphan and lonely

847
01:14:41,336 --> 01:14:44,890
But her heart was as white as snow

848
01:14:45,536 --> 01:14:48,912
After long wandering

849
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:52,767
A vagabond passed by

850
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:56,802
His torn shirt and shoes

851
01:14:57,342 --> 01:15:00,800
Were accompanied by the sound of a flute

852
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:28,063
One afternoon the vagabond

853
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:32,135
Arrived at the house of the girl

854
01:15:32,697 --> 01:15:36,065
He was tired and weary

855
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:40,183
He asked for some food and drink

856
01:15:40,429 --> 01:15:43,925
The girl told the boy to come in

857
01:15:44,629 --> 01:15:48,095
She made him sit at her table

858
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:52,354
And when evening came

859
01:15:52,686 --> 01:15:55,948
She put him in her bed

860
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:23,335
The vagabond thanked the girl
for the night

861
01:16:23,808 --> 01:16:26,920
Full of gratitude

862
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,952
The girl said softly

863
01:16:31,637 --> 01:16:34,914
"Stay with me forever"

864
01:16:37,523 --> 01:16:39,420
Do you, Istvan Bencsik,

865
01:16:39,613 --> 01:16:43,985
take Julia Keresztes
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

866
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,300
I do.

867
01:16:47,546 --> 01:16:49,482
Do you, Julia Keresztes,

868
01:16:49,675 --> 01:16:53,478
take Istvan Bencsik
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

869
01:16:54,205 --> 01:16:55,205
I do.

870
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,155
But a day came

871
01:17:16,418 --> 01:17:18,427
When the boy said:

872
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:21,870
"I'm being expected, I must go

873
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:26,370
It was nice with you, but I can't stand

874
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,813
This life any longer"

875
01:17:30,218 --> 01:17:34,190
The girl only asked for another night

876
01:17:34,438 --> 01:17:37,755
"You can leave tomorrow," she said

877
01:17:37,948 --> 01:17:42,042
Oh and the boy remained in the valley

878
01:17:42,223 --> 01:17:45,495
Buried forever

879
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:48,445
There were many people who loved truly

880
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:53,110
Oh, yes

881
01:18:54,303 --> 01:18:59,012
But could never be happy

882
01:18:59,381 --> 01:19:03,290
Oh, yes

883
01:19:04,525 --> 01:19:09,175
We're watching the TV
and going to the movies

884
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:13,105
Oh, yes

885
01:19:15,337 --> 01:19:19,664
I can imagine what our life will be like

886
01:19:20,361 --> 01:19:23,947
Oh, yes

887
01:19:24,285 --> 01:19:25,942
Don't cry, girls

888
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:28,717
Don't cry, boys

889
01:19:29,677 --> 01:19:31,275
Don't cry, girls

890
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:34,529
Life is beautiful

891
01:19:34,882 --> 01:19:36,614
Don't cry, girls

892
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:39,202
Don't cry, boys

893
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,864
Don't cry, girls

894
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:48,059
How beautiful life could be

895
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:15,065
The architect planned a big house

896
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:19,583
Oh, yes

897
01:20:20,705 --> 01:20:25,220
Why it turned out to be bad,
he still can't understand

898
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:29,143
Oh, yes

899
01:20:29,526 --> 01:20:31,280
Don't cry, girls

900
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:33,800
Don't cry, boys

901
01:20:34,865 --> 01:20:36,410
Don't cry, girls

902
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:39,703
Life is beautiful

903
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:41,682
Don't cry, girls

904
01:20:42,643 --> 01:20:44,277
Don't cry, boys

905
01:20:45,297 --> 01:20:46,873
Don't cry, girls

906
01:20:47,233 --> 01:20:52,708
How beautiful life could be

907
01:20:53,075 --> 01:20:54,785
Don't cry, girls

908
01:20:55,656 --> 01:20:57,290
Don't cry, boys

909
01:20:58,326 --> 01:20:59,953
Don't cry, girls

910
01:22:15,739 --> 01:22:17,774
There is a big river somewhere

911
01:22:18,427 --> 01:22:20,369
It's never navigable

912
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:24,734
An object submerged in its water
does not lose from its weight

913
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:27,427
And all the ships sink

914
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,955
Somewhere a little flower

915
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,632
Is smiling to see you again

916
01:22:33,179 --> 01:22:35,354
It's being picked

917
01:22:35,547 --> 01:22:39,389
and wanders into a vase
to adorn her home

918
01:22:45,548 --> 01:22:47,760
We live and we die

919
01:22:47,956 --> 01:22:50,070
So wish us lovely dreams

920
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:52,950
We live and we die

921
01:22:53,414 --> 01:22:55,259
So wish us lovely dreams

922
01:22:56,242 --> 01:22:58,484
We live and we die

923
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:00,599
So wish us lovely dreams

924
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:03,750
We live and we die

925
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:05,961
So wish us lovely dreams

926
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:20,110
Somewhere an armchair

927
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,795
A bit old but still nice

928
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:29,342
Can't wait to surround its sweetheart
It hasn't seen for so long

929
01:23:30,101 --> 01:23:32,155
Somewhere a grave

930
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:34,712
Has become so poor

931
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,712
It sorrowfully thinks of

932
01:23:37,878 --> 01:23:41,462
Having given shelter to so many people
While it was still young

933
01:23:47,253 --> 01:23:49,398
We live and we die

934
01:23:49,668 --> 01:23:51,680
So wish us lovely dreams

935
01:23:52,488 --> 01:23:54,692
We live and we die

936
01:23:55,016 --> 01:23:56,950
So wish us lovely dreams

937
01:23:57,798 --> 01:24:00,190
We live and we die

938
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,425
So wish us lovely dreams

939
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:05,395
We live and we die

940
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,750
So wish us lovely dreams

941
01:24:08,568 --> 01:24:10,787
We live and we die

942
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,119
So wish us lovely dreams

943
01:24:13,945 --> 01:24:16,164
We live and we die

944
01:24:16,608 --> 01:24:18,528
So wish us lovely dreams

945
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:21,514
We live and we die

946
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,629
So wish us lovely dreams
