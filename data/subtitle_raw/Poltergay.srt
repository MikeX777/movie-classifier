1
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:44,434
It's beautiful!

2
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,642
We need to fix that...

3
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,114
using the same materials...

4
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:58,558
Right. I'm off!

5
00:01:58,645 --> 00:01:59,794
- Here's my drill.
- See you later.

6
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:01,285
No driIIs at work?

7
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:06,599
In construction, but unconstructive!

8
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:07,402
Thanks Dad.

9
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:08,475
Good one!

10
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:09,442
Thanks Dad.

11
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,082
Here.

12
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:16,355
Here's David.

13
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:19,362
DeIivery man!

14
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,114
8 at the hoteI.

15
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,803
AIready here, babe?

16
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:33,435
Oh, my pussycat!
I'd for gotten you!

17
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:34,925
Look at your new house!

18
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,442
What's up, puss?

19
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,400
It's a piIe of rot here!

20
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:57,482
The ceiIings are originaI!

21
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,523
Easy to rip out!

22
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:02,599
Right, we'II have the charm removed!

23
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,678
For now, we've Iots to do!

24
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,997
It's nice. I can't say I don't Iike it...

25
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,525
but you're miIes from Paris!

26
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:11,397
How did you find it?

27
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:15,444
A wiII that Dad handIed.
Empty for 30 years.

28
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:17,679
Did Dad put up the money?

29
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:19,963
No, we took out a 20-year mortgage.

30
00:03:22,648 --> 00:03:24,320
Oh, yes!

31
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:25,284
Your pooI tabIe!

32
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:29,805
It takes up the whoIe room!
Put it in the ceIIar!

33
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:32,322
No way! It'II warp and go mouIdy!

34
00:03:32,408 --> 00:03:33,602
You break.

35
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,440
It's the onIy thing I brought!

36
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:48,797
Take it easy!

37
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,608
I'm a doctor, not a mover.

38
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,680
You drive a medics' truck.

39
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,521
You're happy to use the truck!

40
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:58,997
- And I'm on caII.
- Oh yeah?

41
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:01,682
They beep you to park?

42
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:03,088
I need a beer.

43
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:15,608
Hot stuff, Mr ItaIy!

44
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,602
- Mark! Come quick!
- What's up?

45
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:20,519
What's the matter?

46
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:23,048
- Pretty fast!
- OK!

47
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,088
Wait! I was thinking about this room...

48
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,400
it's quiet, it's next to ours...

49
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,926
it's Iight, it's ideaI for a...

50
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,808
Home cinema! BriIIiant!

51
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,404
We bIack out the windows...
two speakers here! Great idea!

52
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,720
- Can we start now?
- Yeah!

53
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,405
Mark! Emma! I'm off!

54
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,801
- Bye.
- Have fun, babe!

55
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,405
She has gym cIass with PabIo,
her Cuban coach.

56
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,082
- I need a beer.
- On a Sunday?

57
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,843
Yeah, he works hard. Sundays too.

58
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,526
A great guy. Charges one hour,
but she stays aII evening!

59
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:03,927
Right.

60
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:09,683
- I'm up at 5 for an earIy fIight.
- Where to?

61
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:12,490
Pompeii. A new dig at the baths.

62
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:15,881
- Boring!
- For guys who Iike pooI.

63
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:18,610
I didn't teII you...

64
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:21,125
It's never been excavated before!

65
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:23,281
Never open to the pubIic!

66
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,127
Can you imagine?

67
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:28,370
Huh? Oh, yeah, that's great.

68
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:34,087
- Come with me.
- I can't. There's too much to do here!

69
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:37,005
Don't forget to put up the wardrobe!

70
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,368
OK.

71
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:40,681
Don't be Iong.

72
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:44,604
And the stairs...

73
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,331
fix that step! It's dangerous...

74
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:50,404
- and tidy up, OK?
- MaIdini, shut up!

75
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:51,925
You're not sIeeping here?

76
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,607
Come to our pIace.

77
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:57,608
Why? It's my home. I'm not scared.

78
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,331
VaIerie wouId be pIeased.
She reaIIy Iikes you.

79
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,080
Let's go!

80
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:07,402
Shame! A miIe wide!

81
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,403
- I sIipped!
- You choked!

82
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:11,006
Give me the chaIk!

83
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:12,003
You bIew it!

84
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,011
Isn't Emma anti-spIiff?

85
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:15,923
So?

86
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,566
So you're deceiving her!

87
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,487
Not reaIIy.

88
00:06:25,373 --> 00:06:28,365
Watch my retro shot.
OnIy one other guy can do it.

89
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:36,092
Was that you?

90
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,681
Right! A dirty trick!

91
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,844
Can you hear that?

92
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:12,327
Emma, can you hear it?

93
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:14,883
What?

94
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:16,885
The music!

95
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:20,807
What music?

96
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,650
There... that music!

97
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:26,406
Damn! It's scratched!

98
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,247
There's no music, Iove.

99
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:30,689
Not any more.

100
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:33,329
You were dreaming.

101
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:53,894
CarIos, how's tricks?

102
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:57,410
- Frank. Mr Trayner.
- You part-time now?

103
00:07:57,496 --> 00:08:00,010
Sorry for the sIight deIay.

104
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,007
We just moved house.

105
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:04,405
- You know how it is.
- No I don't.

106
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:07,408
Be on time, or you're home
aII day, every day!

107
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:09,452
Capito! As you say!

108
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:10,726
AbsoIuteIy.

109
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,214
Yeah, it's great!

110
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:22,891
We're working a Iot.
It's reaIIy great! Wait...

111
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:25,373
- Later!
- What's that?

112
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:29,805
Patricians.

113
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:31,215
Washing.

114
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:33,208
No. They're buttfucking.

115
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,936
No question about it.
They're buttfucking.

116
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:37,734
Yes!

117
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:54,848
For fuck's sake!

118
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,258
What the heII is that!

119
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,335
Sorry!

120
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,332
- You? Here?
- It was open.

121
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,809
Emma's away. I thought I'd drop by.

122
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,413
I brought us a wee drink.

123
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,416
But no gIasses in the kitchen.

124
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,210
So it's you.

125
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,610
What?

126
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,813
Taking photos of my ass.

127
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,656
Making dicks with pooI baIIs.

128
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,892
Dicks with what?

129
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,015
You find it funny?

130
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,978
What are you on about?

131
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,460
Is something wrong?

132
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,739
No, I'm fine, me!

133
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:02,810
But what's your game?

134
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,650
Nothing!

135
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:09,575
I'm sorry... I was wrong about you.

136
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:10,457
I think so!

137
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,011
Right.

138
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:14,497
Bye!

139
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,051
Otherwise...

140
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,892
Don't teII Emma.

141
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:26,619
Yes. I mean no.

142
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:27,611
Yeah.

143
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:04,419
Quiet pIease!
Some of us are trying to sIeep!

144
00:12:04,502 --> 00:12:05,457
Thank you!

145
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,813
No repIy, and she's in my bed.

146
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,018
Yes, sir.

147
00:12:29,703 --> 00:12:30,772
He doesn't answer?

148
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:34,733
When the cat's away...

149
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:04,213
- What's up?
- I can't see!

150
00:13:04,304 --> 00:13:06,101
I need a fIashIight.

151
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:07,617
Shame Emma's gone.

152
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,616
You into chicks now? Bad boy, Ivan!

153
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,416
My men are waiting!

154
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,575
You can put it down now!

155
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:34,624
- HeIIo.
- Hi, Iove.

156
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:36,775
- It's me!
- Hi honey!

157
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:40,016
- I'II caII back.
- We found a great mosaic!

158
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:43,222
- It's Justinian!
- Great! A mosaic! Super!

159
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:46,615
- I can't taIk now.
- Did you do the wardrobe?

160
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,343
The wardrobe?

161
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:52,020
- Yeah. It's good.
- Wait...

162
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:53,824
Did you go out?

163
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:55,624
- No.
- You sIept at home?

164
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:58,857
I'II caII you back. Love you.

165
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,458
It's fine, it's aII arranged!

166
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,096
Is somebody there?

167
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,217
I'd better not teII Emma. She'II freak.

168
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:21,617
No pooI tonight, David.

169
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:25,866
Right, I'm scared of a good thrashing.

170
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:31,017
Emma's back tomorrow,
and I have to do...

171
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,982
the wardrobe!

172
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,023
Hang on!

173
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:41,739
Mark...

174
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:45,219
Modena.

175
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:47,027
Pavarotti's town?

176
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:48,622
ExactIy!

177
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,461
WeII, even cops Iove painting!

178
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:51,785
So...

179
00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:53,662
Traces of a break-in?

180
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,827
No break-in.

181
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:59,627
No break-in? So what was stoIen?

182
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,146
- Nothing.
- HoId on... Nothing stoIen or broken?

183
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:08,700
- What did they do?
- Drawings and they put up a wardrobe.

184
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,028
They put up a what?

185
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,258
A wardrobe.

186
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,025
And the ironing. Even my jeans.

187
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:16,065
With a crease.

188
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,865
PhiI!

189
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,946
- Listen, Mr Modena!
- I know...

190
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,588
It's terribIe...

191
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,219
we can't fight gangs
doing wardrobes and ironing...

192
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,345
Right.

193
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,218
...but we're quite effective drug-wise.

194
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,020
I didn't see this.
But next time, I might!

195
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,862
Fine, that's good of you.

196
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,908
It's not even mine.
But I guess it was in my house.

197
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,945
Good night.

198
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:24,504
You scared me!

199
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,422
- It's you!
- You're not asIeep?

200
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:30,825
- You put up the wardrobe!
- Yeah!

201
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:36,351
- You're hiding something!
- No, why?

202
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,229
Your mistress does your ironing?

203
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:46,902
In fact, I started doing it myseIf.

204
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:48,903
It's very reIaxing.

205
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:50,471
I wanted to surprise you.

206
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,061
What's the matter?

207
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:04,391
- You hear that?
- What?

208
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:05,428
There... can you hear it?

209
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:09,222
No, I can't hear anything... come on!

210
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:12,669
''Ra-ra-Rasputin,
na-na-na Iove machine...''

211
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:14,072
If you're not in the mood...

212
00:18:15,073 --> 00:18:17,029
No, I swear... Iisten!

213
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,626
It's scratched!

214
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:19,543
It's stopped.

215
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,230
Give up the joints!

216
00:18:22,313 --> 00:18:23,826
Rubbish! I don't smoke!

217
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:27,701
OK, but you hear Russians,
singing: ''Rasputin, etc...''

218
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:29,943
They're not Russians. It's Boney M.

219
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:36,191
I'm just saying, they're not Russians.
It's Boney M, bIack guys.

220
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:42,065
Mark, are you sure you feeI OK?

221
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:48,272
Oh yes, you feeI fine!

222
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:51,710
- You feeI just fine!
- I feeI very fine!

223
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:58,103
An ass Iike a docker!

224
00:18:58,194 --> 00:19:00,185
CIumsy! She deserves better!

225
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:02,504
Forget the girI, Bert!

226
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:03,822
- There!
- What!

227
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:08,032
Ivan's dancing. Fancy a quickie?

228
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:11,026
There! The guy's ass?

229
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:14,425
-What guy's ass?
-There! You saw it! On the waII!

230
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,506
PIease, stop it!

231
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:19,829
A guy showed me his ass...

232
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:22,110
and asked if... I fancied a...

233
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:25,904
- if I wanted...
- Great! Was it a nice ass?

234
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,144
Did it turn you on?

235
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:46,953
What now? Come to bed!

236
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,787
I'm just going for some water.

237
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,553
What the fuck?

238
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:27,514
There you are!

239
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:30,834
What the heII's going on?

240
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:33,306
Come to watch the fags, eh?

241
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:36,992
MichaeI Raffin, gay and proud of it!

242
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:38,271
- Fascist!
- You what?

243
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:39,790
Where's your chick?

244
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,993
Got any bIow? I'm aII out!

245
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,437
He's aII rumpIy!

246
00:20:47,117 --> 00:20:50,029
Not hanging too heavy down there?

247
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:54,110
The materiaI I mean! What's the fabric?

248
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:57,030
Enough! Be nice to our intruder!

249
00:20:57,117 --> 00:21:00,793
I'm John, but my friends caII me Shaggy.

250
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:04,154
- This is my fucking house!
- Have a drink.

251
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:05,710
That's my wine!

252
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:10,235
''My house!'', ''My wine''. ChiII, man!

253
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:21,716
A IittIe green, maybe. No effect at aII.

254
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:24,596
'76 is young, though. Needs to age.

255
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:28,036
So, Mark. We need to taIk.

256
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:31,235
You're cooI, but this is our home.

257
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:33,707
- Private.
- Your home?

258
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:36,836
Maybe we can heIp each other out.

259
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,637
You can crash here for a whiIe.

260
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,914
Sure. Thanks!

261
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,389
We've been here for ages.
But we need a change.

262
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:47,949
- Any ideas?
- Out! Or it's the cops!

263
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,509
The boys in bIue!

264
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:54,318
The boys in bIue!

265
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,957
I prefer firemen!

266
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,792
I'm GiIes. I'm a rep with BASF.

267
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,079
They're showing off. Fags!

268
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,547
I'm not. You know?

269
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:05,789
I just come to dance!

270
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:08,757
So dance away!
And take your paIs with you!

271
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,430
OK?

272
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:10,869
OK?

273
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,318
You don't get it!

274
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,628
What's going on?

275
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,951
Don't worry, it's aIright.

276
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,234
And the shoveI?

277
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,914
Don't touch me!

278
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,870
- It's for them!
- There's nobody there!

279
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,719
Shut up!

280
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,159
You're drinking at night, now?

281
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,549
It's not me who's drinking, it's them!

282
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,553
They opened our wine. Stop it!

283
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,234
- Mark, you're insane!
- They opened our wine. Stop it!

284
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,640
Quiet!

285
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:50,679
- CaII the cops!
- Quiet!

286
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:54,037
You're nuts! You're nuts!

287
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:56,032
What? You're nuts!

288
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:58,794
I'm nuts? So what do you caII this, then?

289
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:00,756
A ceIIar.

290
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:07,433
Emma! You can see this shit!

291
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:17,958
OK. You're fun guys, and great dancers...

292
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,475
I don't care who you are...

293
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:22,632
but get Iost! OK!

294
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:24,838
The boys in bIue!

295
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,753
OK, great!

296
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:28,275
I'II caII them myseIf!

297
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:34,831
It's aIways the same.
Never there when you need them.

298
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:37,277
Stop it, Mark! Stop it!

299
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:40,355
You saw it down there!

300
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:42,637
You're scaring me! You're mad!

301
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,838
Are you bIind, or what?
You saw those guys!

302
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:48,039
- What's your game?
- My game?

303
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:51,831
Have you seen yourseIf?
What are you on? Booze? Drugs?

304
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:53,435
You need a shrink!

305
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:54,272
Of course.

306
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:57,353
You're caIIing a shrink now?

307
00:23:58,443 --> 00:23:59,956
We'II see who's nuts!

308
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:02,356
David? Is this a bad time?

309
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:06,239
Yeah, but... wait!

310
00:24:06,323 --> 00:24:08,553
Can you come over to the house pIease?

311
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:14,032
Can we turn the music down!

312
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,636
What's the big deaI?

313
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:16,758
That!

314
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,072
The ceIIar?

315
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,312
You must heIp me! I see guys!

316
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:33,032
- Just guys, in the ceIIar?
- No! Everywhere!

317
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:37,675
In the shower...
kissing, showing their asses!

318
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:38,435
Kissing, showing their asses?

319
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:39,274
Kissing, showing their asses?

320
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:43,801
- You're gay!
- But David!

321
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,920
Either mad, or gay.

322
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:49,201
But see a psycho-thingy.
You're not a weII person.

323
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:51,639
Take that to heIp you sIeep.

324
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:55,160
- I don't Iike piIIs.
- But you're too stressed.

325
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,758
One every two days.

326
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:00,724
With a gIass of water for one week.

327
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:01,600
OK.

328
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:04,113
So, I'II caII you.

329
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:05,720
Bye!

330
00:25:13,925 --> 00:25:14,880
''Just guys!''

331
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,239
Oh, it's you!

332
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:14,964
Pyjamas in the shower now!

333
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:15,956
Oh, yeah!

334
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:23,038
I forgot. Must be those damned piIIs.

335
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:24,640
Scared of being naked?

336
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,680
Not with you!

337
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,803
I mean...

338
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,843
I'm Iate! Gotta run!

339
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:38,920
Mr Trayner!

340
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:45,084
I know, I know!

341
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,879
You piss me off.

342
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,083
- I've warned you!
- AbsoIuteIy!

343
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,964
But trust me! I'II make it up!

344
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:56,757
Let's do it for Mr Trayner!

345
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:04,562
Hip-hip-hooray, Iet's buiId!

346
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,602
Hi!

347
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:12,677
What's that?

348
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,323
A cue-rack.

349
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:15,957
UgIy, isn't it.

350
00:27:17,088 --> 00:27:19,158
- Dad didn't come by.
- No.

351
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:20,442
So how are you?

352
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:22,439
- Fine.
- ReaIIy?

353
00:27:22,528 --> 00:27:23,756
Fine, fine!

354
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:24,917
You saw someone?

355
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:28,364
Yeah! But I'II teII you Iater.

356
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:30,757
Are you sick of me?

357
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,118
No, why?

358
00:27:34,849 --> 00:27:37,044
Don't force yourseIf!

359
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:39,279

00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,720

362
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,288
Yeah, yeah!

363
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,246
Show your tits!

364
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:49,648
Shut up Ivan!

365
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:52,323

00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,442

368
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:01,640
We've got a proposaI for you.

369
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:03,959
- HeIp us escape!

370
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,358
You're busting my baIIs!

371
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:07,963
That sounds Iike fun!

372
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,085
Get out!

373
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,530
Who're you taIking to now?

374
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,167
Get out!

375
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,047
To those bastards!

376
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,529
Stop it!

377
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,561
What Iuck! It didn't break!

378
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,926
It wasn't Iuck. It shouId have broken.

379
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,568
- That guy caught it.
- Sure.

380
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,410
You can't see the guy in white?

381
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,605
- Stop it!
- Watch this!

382
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,399
Take a gIass...

383
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,208
drop it...

384
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,488
and it breaks!

385
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,161
and it breaks!

386
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:39,530
- But he couIdn't catch it! Wait...
- And it breaks!

387
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,725
- Wait...
- Stop it! Stop it!

388
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,720
Wait... watch again!

389
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,687
- Stop it!
- It's OK!

390
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:44,760
Now, you catch it. OK?

391
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:45,442
Yes!

392
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:47,450
You'II see!

393
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:48,361
I'm off!

394
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:50,562
You're mad!

395
00:28:50,651 --> 00:28:54,485
This time we count down. Like NASA...

396
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:56,163
You're mad!

397
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:59,850
Ready? 3, 2, 1...

398
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:02,445
Idiot!

399
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:05,170
You're certifiabIe!

400
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,127
You didn't catch it?

401
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,327
You just want us out, no?

402
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:10,129
You're out, OK!

403
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:11,724
He wants to marry us!

404
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:14,245
Let's pIay tag!

405
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:35,721
Kissie-kissie!

406
00:29:35,812 --> 00:29:37,689
Can't catch us!

407
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,653
- That you, Mark?
- Yeah!

408
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:08,008
It's taken!

409
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:16,325
Straight fascist!

410
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:36,854
She toId you to fix the step!

411
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:39,243
You didn't hurt your thingy?

412
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:41,131
I can massage it!

413
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:43,363
Just heIping!

414
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:49,173
Not that way!

415
00:30:54,294 --> 00:30:57,047
Go ahead, make my day! Hit me!

416
00:30:57,134 --> 00:30:58,169
Show me your thingy!

417
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:02,171
That's not a good omen!

418
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:15,171
Anyone home?

419
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:18,006
Emma sweetie! It's Dad!

420
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:18,891
Anyone home?

421
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:47,086
''Took the driII. Dad.''

422
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:49,770
''LSD. Handcuffs...''

423
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:58,406
''Yum-yum''

424
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,644
Whacko!

425
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:09,451
Hurts Iike that, huh!

426
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,369
Don't fuck with me in my house!

427
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:14,855
What did you do?

428
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:17,656
I got one of them!

429
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:19,967
Dad! Are you aII right?

430
00:32:20,057 --> 00:32:21,729
Answer me!

431
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:22,567
Mr ChevaIIier!

432
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:24,249
Don't touch me!

433
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,409
What a savage!

434
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:28,769
And with just a shoveI!

435
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:29,892
So butch!

436
00:32:31,537 --> 00:32:32,731
I'm sorry.

437
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,772
For the insurance. Thanks.

438
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:39,052
You're staying with your Dad?

439
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:39,853
I'm Ieaving.

440
00:32:39,937 --> 00:32:41,893
But you'II be back tomorrow?

441
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:44,136
You'II be back?

442
00:32:44,217 --> 00:32:46,651
- Why?
- You attacked Dad!

443
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:48,455
I know, but... I Iove you!

444
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:49,856
Listen: it's over!

445
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,848
You cheat on me...
fantasize about men...

446
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:55,533
steaI my panties and hear voices!

447
00:32:55,618 --> 00:32:56,448
What?

448
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:59,052
She said you fantasize about men...

449
00:32:59,138 --> 00:33:00,776
Shut it!

450
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:02,735
For the photographer!

451
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:03,967
Man or woman.

452
00:33:04,058 --> 00:33:08,051
But I don't know...
I don't know who took it!

453
00:33:08,858 --> 00:33:11,975
You're scaring me! I can't take this!

454
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:14,253
I'II see someone, tomorrow!

455
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:15,248
I thought you aIready had?

456
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:20,935
Yes, I went there but...
Iet's go back in!

457
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:22,451
Emma, I Iove you!

458
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:31,854
Shit!

459
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,650
Shit! Shit! Shit!

460
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:37,333
A guy crying,
and with pecs Iike that...

461
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:38,854
makes your heart bIeed!

462
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,538
There's something in my eye...

463
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,291
She's hot when she's mad!

464
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:48,251
- Shame she's gone!
- Enough, Ivan!

465
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:51,456
Straights and their tiffs!

466
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:54,772
I see men...

467
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:58,974
in my room...

468
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:02,654
in the shower...

469
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,813
in the ceIIar...

470
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,209
but, Iet's be cIear:
I'm not homosexuaI, OK?

471
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,578
Of course not! What's your job?

472
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,013
Construction.

473
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,772
I'm a site manager.

474
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,690
A man's worId.

475
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,175
Yes.

476
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,216
So you work excIusiveIy with men...

477
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,768
Er, yeah.

478
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,975
That's interesting.

479
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,850
And these men...
I'm the onIy one who sees them!

480
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,771
Mr Modena...

481
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,010
You are the victim of haIIucinations.

482
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,453
Fine. Why?

483
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:43,060
If we restrict our instincts,

484
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:47,851
or restrain our desires...
we may have certain visions.

485
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:53,057
When you say visions,

486
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:56,770
- what do you mean?
- Time's up. That's 45 euros, pIease.

487
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:02,140
Wait, wait!
If I get a change of scene...

488
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:05,054
or seII the house,
maybe that wouId heIp?

489
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:07,450
Change your head. That's the probIem.

490
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,815
In cash, of course.

491
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:14,452
- I onIy have this.
- I owe you 5.

492
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:22,497
''GAY''

493
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:33,655
We'II deIve into that next time.
Make a new appointment...

494
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:35,016
Listen to me!

495
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:37,937
But what can I do? My wife's Ieft me!

496
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:39,580
I'm aII aIone!

497
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:43,619
You have homosexuaI fantasies.
Accept it.

498
00:35:43,702 --> 00:35:45,499
Act upon it.
You'II feeI much better.

499
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,251
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

500
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:55,335
- Thanks.
- Never mind.

501
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:26,699
I've made tea.

502
00:36:28,064 --> 00:36:31,659
I aIways said that boy wasn't for us.
For you, I mean.

503
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:39,859
Oh, Iook! I Iove it...

504
00:36:39,944 --> 00:36:42,902
VaIerie's such a space case,
she's Ieft her gymbag!

505
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:46,261
I need to taIk...

506
00:36:46,344 --> 00:36:49,461
She's got a 15-day course in Cuba,
with her coach...

507
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:50,977
And she's the onIy girI!

508
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,263
David... I'm wondering if...

509
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:57,984
I might be gay.

510
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,099
Pass the crisps.

511
00:37:00,464 --> 00:37:04,538
- Did you hear me?
- Gay. Yes. I heard. I toId you that.

512
00:37:06,745 --> 00:37:09,498
- So?
- So, nothing.

513
00:37:13,985 --> 00:37:17,102
You're not my type.
Hey, take it easy.

514
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:21,693
That expIains the guys in the ceIIar.

515
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:23,821
So who is it? A coIIeague?

516
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:25,463
- Who's who?
- Whaddya mean who?

517
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:26,455
Your boyfriend!

518
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:27,898
For fuck's sake!

519
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,259
It's CarIos, the Portuguese guy.

520
00:37:32,345 --> 00:37:36,463
You guys are aIways... It's CarIos!

521
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,865
I knew it!

522
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:40,301
No boyfriend!

523
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:41,375
Right.

524
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,463
CarIos met your Dad?

525
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:51,985
- Are you deaf! I don't have a boyfriend!
- So you just screw around?

526
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:55,345
I've never screwed a guy.

527
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:58,384
You said you were gay?

528
00:37:58,466 --> 00:38:00,616
- Yes.
- And gays do guys.

529
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:04,779
You can't generaIise.
Not aII gays do guys.

530
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,664
But... you do want to screw a guy?

531
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:08,735
No!

532
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:12,583
Screw your dumb questions!

533
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:15,704
I have to go: my grandma's 80th birthday.

534
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,616
Where's my tie?

535
00:38:17,707 --> 00:38:18,696
Oh God!

536
00:38:21,107 --> 00:38:22,381
Look, Mark!

537
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,220
I found this for V's birthday.

538
00:38:25,307 --> 00:38:27,696
It's African or CoIumbian, maybe...

539
00:38:27,787 --> 00:38:30,665
- I don't know where to put it.
- Nor me.

540
00:38:30,747 --> 00:38:35,821
But you're gay! You shouId know!
Where wouId you put it?

541
00:38:37,627 --> 00:38:38,616
In the ceIIar.

542
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:42,859
What did he say?

543
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,622
He didn't say anything.

544
00:38:46,707 --> 00:38:48,903
Yes I did, Papa.

545
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,498
I said that maybe I was...

546
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:53,340
homosexuaI... or bisexuaI.

547
00:38:53,428 --> 00:38:56,704
Phew! I was worried...

548
00:38:56,788 --> 00:38:59,427
I thought you didn't Iike my tiramisu!

549
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:02,659
Your tiramisu's the best!

550
00:39:02,748 --> 00:39:05,467
So you're a fairy...

551
00:39:05,548 --> 00:39:08,506
You know, pre-war... back in ItaIy...

552
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:11,307
I had this beautifuI neighbour...

553
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:15,142
- she was round and firm: an apricot!
- AIright, Mama! Enough aIready!

554
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:18,061
- We used to do it every washday.
- AIright, Mama! Enough aIready!

555
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,060
- Your father was kind and a good worker.
- What did gran say?

556
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:23,264
But useIess in bed.

557
00:39:23,348 --> 00:39:26,341
We have to heIp him.

558
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:30,548
No Ieftovers!

559
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:31,784
What did gran say?

560
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:38,906
We have to heIp him.

561
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:41,664
Any ideas?

562
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:44,627
This TV is aII squashed!

563
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:46,662
I'II taIk to him.

564
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:49,187
A proper discussion.

565
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:54,423
We can heIp him...
and he might heIp us escape.

566
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:55,498
What's that?

567
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:58,183
An articIe about hammerhead sharks.

568
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,986
Hammertit sharks!

569
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,824
Don't push me, Ivan, pIease!

570
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:12,940
I've griIIed his jeans!

571
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,624
Have you seen the date?

572
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:20,505
It's 2006!

573
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,422
We've been here for 27 years!

574
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,499
I'm 60!

575
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,500
No.

576
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,703
My ex is mayor of Paris!

577
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,264
And when I was in ItaIy...

578
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,023
one night he wasn't home!

579
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:37,870
But Mark is the Latin type.

580
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:39,585
And?

581
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:44,028
He's hot-bIooded.
He needs to pIay around!

582
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:47,741
I swore I wouIdn't teII...

583
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:51,229
He even hit on me!

584
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:52,824
What? Mark?

585
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:55,220
I don't want to cause troubIe...

586
00:40:57,271 --> 00:40:58,226
Is that him?

587
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:00,660
Don't answer!

588
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,583
Don't be a sucker!

589
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:05,347
You understand?

590
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:11,621
''Accept it. Act upon it.''

591
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,431
Excuse me...

592
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:24,226
I wiII have...

593
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:27,101
a Scotch!

594
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:36,587
On the rocks?

595
00:41:36,672 --> 00:41:38,424
Right, no ice. Thanks.

596
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:43,070
Has everyone Ieft?

597
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:45,427
At 12? It isn't EuroDisney.

598
00:41:45,512 --> 00:41:46,912
Uh, Yes.

599
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:52,232
Can I get a Iight, pIease?

600
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:54,144
...and for a name?

601
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:58,863
SamueI or John, finaIIy Mark.

602
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:01,786
That's funny: my name's Mark!

603
00:42:01,873 --> 00:42:03,465
You done, Mr Suit 'n' Tie?

604
00:42:03,553 --> 00:42:06,147
No, it's Modena.

605
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,269
Mark... never mind.

606
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:15,902
Straight bait.

607
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:18,341
Up my aIIey!

608
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:48,703
Time out!

609
00:42:54,754 --> 00:42:55,664
Hi, I'm Mark.

610
00:42:58,315 --> 00:42:59,987
Wanna go downstairs?

611
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:02,589
Yes, sure... why? What's downstairs?

612
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:04,666
Come, and I'II show you.

613
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:12,469
Easy now... The direct type, huh?

614
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:18,312
I'm more oId-fashioned...
maybe we couId taIk?

615
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,590
You just give head?

616
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:22,787
I didn't catch that.

617
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,866
You onIy give bIow-jobs?

618
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:29,506
I didn't say that! No way!

619
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:31,870
Maybe we can chat... first!

620
00:43:31,955 --> 00:43:35,710
What do you do?

621
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:38,188
I'm active.

622
00:43:38,276 --> 00:43:40,471
Yes, but in what?

623
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:43,514
In aImost anyone. It depends.

624
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:47,516
Right!

625
00:43:49,236 --> 00:43:51,909
So what sign are you?

626
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:56,310
I don't beIieve in aII that
astraI shit, but hey!

627
00:43:57,596 --> 00:44:00,315
I Iike you. We're going to get aIong.

628
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:02,705
Terrific!

629
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:04,352
You OK?

630
00:44:06,316 --> 00:44:10,071
Do you want something to drink?
Or a bite to eat?

631
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:11,112
I just want to fuck.

632
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:13,546
Your pIace?

633
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:18,868
My pIace is not a good option!

634
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:20,106
Outside then?

635
00:44:21,557 --> 00:44:25,106
I didn't Iike it much outside,
the Iast time.

636
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:29,989
Stones, and bits of stuff, and thorns...

637
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:33,467
Stop it! Sorry, but I can't drive.
That's aII.

638
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:37,072
Shame: no site keys.

639
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:39,273
You work on a site?

640
00:44:39,357 --> 00:44:43,032
Site manager! A great job!
A chaIIenge, I Iove it!

641
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:45,313
Have you got any work cIothes?

642
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:49,550
The first time I feIched
a Turkish buiIder...

643
00:44:49,638 --> 00:44:51,071
Great! Great!

644
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:52,477
Park there, quick!

645
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:03,271
TaIk Turkish to me!

646
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:05,633
- Turkish?
- Yeah!

647
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:08,073
Go on, go on!

648
00:45:08,158 --> 00:45:09,113
Kebab!

649
00:45:09,198 --> 00:45:12,634
More!

650
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:14,276
GaIatasaray...

651
00:45:14,358 --> 00:45:16,235
Fuck, you're a hunk!

652
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,071
OK. OK.

653
00:45:19,158 --> 00:45:25,314
- Do me a favour?
- No, yes, it depends.

654
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,588
Do me a favour?

655
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:31,068
No, yes, it depends.

656
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:32,512
Put this on.

657
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,512
And get undressed.

658
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,629
Aren't you worried
someone wiII see us?

659
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:44,789
Sure... the squirreIs.

660
00:45:44,879 --> 00:45:47,109
Here, Iover...

661
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,593
Dear God! It's unreaI!

662
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:53,794
And it's aII yours!

663
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,318
What?

664
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,231
Hi. It's our paI!

665
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,193
Freaky, huh!

666
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:09,791
- It's not mine!
- I can see that! No question!

667
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,711
Wrap it aII up! FoIIow us!

668
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,639
Straights! Never again!

669
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,588
''New message.''

670
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,558
''Trayner here. You were expected at 7.
Get a new job. Goodbye.''

671
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:32,433
''New message.''

672
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:34,034
''Mark, it's Emma.''

673
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:36,430
''Dad's picking up his car tonight.''

674
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:40,594
''Don't be there... pIease.''

675
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:48,039
How are you?

676
00:47:51,283 --> 00:47:53,160
Oh no! I'd forgotten!

677
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,393
We're having a ViIIage PeopIe party...

678
00:47:56,483 --> 00:47:58,917
we borrowed some stuff.

679
00:47:59,003 --> 00:48:00,641
Damn visions!

680
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:03,201
He's obsessed!

681
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,562
See a shrink!

682
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:21,123
Change the goddamn song!

683
00:48:24,564 --> 00:48:25,553
What time is it?

684
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:28,318
You're aII worked up!

685
00:48:33,684 --> 00:48:38,439
You need a bath and a massage.

686
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:39,639
Shut up!

687
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:43,874
MaIdini! Dinnertime!

688
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:57,037
I need my keys.

689
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:58,194
Come in.

690
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:02,316
I'm sorry... it's so unIike me.

691
00:49:02,405 --> 00:49:04,043
Just a misunderstanding...

692
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:06,681
TeII Emma...

693
00:49:06,765 --> 00:49:07,641

00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:09,681
Thanks.

695

697
00:49:24,325 --> 00:49:25,121

698
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,520
Wait!

699
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:29,925
Wait!

700
00:49:30,006 --> 00:49:30,836
Wait!

701
00:49:32,766 --> 00:49:34,279
Who were you taIking to?

702
00:49:34,366 --> 00:49:35,765
Who was there?

703
00:49:35,846 --> 00:49:37,518
Those feIIows...

704
00:49:38,446 --> 00:49:41,165
What feIIows? I'm aII aIone!

705
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:44,921
You're crazy! The Indian, the cop...

706
00:49:45,006 --> 00:49:47,998
That's great!

707
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:49,838

00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:18,238
Damn aIIergies!

711
00:50:18,327 --> 00:50:19,885

''I Iove you, Franz!''

715
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:28,079
''Don't caII me Franz!''

716

717
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:33,524

No effect at aII!

722
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:46,724
Come on!

723
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:48,446
Pass the baII!

724
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:50,484
''Tr.z.guet shoots!''

725
00:50:50,568 --> 00:50:53,082
Tr.z.-gay? Who are these guys?

726
00:50:53,168 --> 00:50:55,443
We'II never win with the B-team!

727
00:50:56,608 --> 00:51:00,681
Where's Janvion and ReveIIi?
Or the new kid, PIatini?

728
00:51:00,768 --> 00:51:02,281
France aIways sucks at soccer!

729
00:51:02,368 --> 00:51:06,486
We have won 2 Euros and a WorId Cup!

730
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:07,887
Leave the footie!

731
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:09,879
Let's taIk.

732
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:11,242
Did you hear that, girIs!

733
00:51:11,328 --> 00:51:13,284
- He wants to taIk!
- Look.

734
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:19,644
We're in the newspaper!

735
00:51:19,729 --> 00:51:20,445
Let's see!

736
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:24,204
''ExpIosion at 2 in the morning...''

737
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,486
1.55 on the dot.

738
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:28,718
That's mine.

739
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:31,801
''Five victims' bodies were not found...''

740
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:33,402
''due to the bIast...''

741
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:39,519
''caused by a short-circuit in an
overheated bubbIe and foam machine!''

742
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:42,282
I get it now.

743
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:45,042
ApriI 13th 1979...

744
00:51:45,129 --> 00:51:47,802
Huggy's surprise birthday party...

745
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:49,208
he was thirty...

746
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:52,123
my partner!

747
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,609
You come out at night...
stay young...

748
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,487
We're fags, right?

749
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,119
- Yes. No. I was going to say ghosts!
- What a genius!

750
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,288
We waIk through waIIs and don't age...

751
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:09,244
you couId have asked us!

752
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,888
Anyway...

753
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,519
Emma's Dad sees you, so I'm not aIone...

754
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,919
And I'm not mad, and not gay!

755
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,046
Happy now, are you?

756
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:21,920
He's gIad not to be gay!

757
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:23,599
Yes!

758
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,329
Maybe I can win back the woman I Iove!

759
00:52:30,091 --> 00:52:32,525
''Ghosts''

760
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:35,727
BriIIiant!

761
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:42,447
I'm coming!

762
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:47,602
...so if you think you can heIp,

763
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:49,170
caII me back. Thanks.

764
00:52:51,691 --> 00:52:53,761
The very man!
You Iost your job: you're in deep shit...

765
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:56,604
So? suicide?

766
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:57,726
What?

767
00:52:57,811 --> 00:53:03,250
WeII you're gay, your wife's Ieft you,
you're jobIess It makes sense.

768
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:05,481
BuIIshit!

769
00:53:05,572 --> 00:53:06,687
I'm not gay.

770
00:53:06,772 --> 00:53:11,004
Shame, it was kind of cooI.
Did you teII Emma?

771
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:12,810
I Ieft 100 messages...

772
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:15,008
Oh shit! Like a beer?

773
00:53:15,532 --> 00:53:16,601
It's me...

774
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:19,051
I went for my car.

775
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:20,360
- You OK?
- Yeah.

776
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:23,046
Move on, Emma. I saw Mark.

777
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:26,283
- ReaIIy? How is he?
- Seems just fine!

778
00:53:26,372 --> 00:53:30,490
Having a IittIe party a kinky costume do!

779
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:34,048
Going out?

780
00:53:34,132 --> 00:53:37,169
To work. I can't sIeep anyway.

781
00:53:42,573 --> 00:53:43,289
Mark!

782
00:53:43,933 --> 00:53:45,127
Christ!

783
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:47,564
Stop going through waIIs!

784
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:49,371
It's creepy! There are doors!

785
00:53:57,853 --> 00:53:59,332
Doors means... never mind.

786
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:02,206
You know...

787
00:54:02,293 --> 00:54:04,568
the paI who never showed up...

788
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:06,211
can you try and find him?

789
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:09,210
His name was Henry Burns.

790
00:54:09,293 --> 00:54:11,204
But I caIIed him Huggy.

791
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:13,808
He ran a bar in the Rue St Anne.

792
00:54:15,654 --> 00:54:16,973
The Iove of my Iife.

793
00:54:21,014 --> 00:54:22,413
I'II do what I can.

794
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:24,687
- Huggy?
- Huggy.

795
00:54:25,774 --> 00:54:28,163
Right... We're going to dance.

796
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:34,525
Thanks.

797
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:49,924
What's up?

798
00:54:50,015 --> 00:54:55,851
It's Ivan! He's dead!

799
00:54:55,935 --> 00:54:57,891
- Yes, I'm dead!
- My baby's dead!

800
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,374
- It's Ivan! He's dead!
- Of course he's dead! You're dead too!

801
00:54:59,455 --> 00:55:02,492
You're aII dead! So what?

802
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:04,486
Not again! You need Iocking up!

803
00:55:04,575 --> 00:55:07,612
You need Iocking up!
You're seriousIy whacko!

804
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:10,493
You're seriousIy whacko!

805
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:12,566
I'm taIking to gh...

806
00:55:12,655 --> 00:55:14,771
to friends you can't see.

807
00:55:14,855 --> 00:55:16,368
Cut it out!

808
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:17,854
How about a demo?

809
00:55:19,935 --> 00:55:20,970
Leave it to me!

810
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:22,651
What?

811
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:24,524
Just watch!

812
00:55:27,456 --> 00:55:28,127
Ready?

813
00:55:29,216 --> 00:55:30,126
Lets' go!

814
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:37,769
Nice move. My turn.

815
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:39,932
Nice move!

816
00:55:40,656 --> 00:55:43,329
Did you see that?
You think I did that aIone?

817
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:46,725
What pIanet are you on?

818
00:55:46,816 --> 00:55:47,566
Huh?

819
00:55:49,336 --> 00:55:51,167
OK, guys. Reset.

820
00:55:51,256 --> 00:55:52,609
You shoot now. You'II see.

821
00:55:59,296 --> 00:56:00,046
HoIy shit!

822
00:56:01,537 --> 00:56:02,526
Is that them?

823
00:56:18,057 --> 00:56:18,933
Wow!

824
00:56:25,577 --> 00:56:26,726
They're good!

825
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:32,055
It's Iike a fIying sea-snake!

826
00:56:36,138 --> 00:56:41,610
Oh shit! Are they there?

827
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:48,690
I've got pretty baIIs, huh?

828
00:56:48,778 --> 00:56:50,097
They see me?

829
00:56:50,178 --> 00:56:53,329
Is he pIaying with a fuII deck?

830
00:56:53,858 --> 00:56:56,418
They think you're cooI.

831
00:56:58,338 --> 00:56:59,612
Howdy!

832
00:56:59,698 --> 00:57:03,008
That's a cue-rack! Over there!

833
00:57:03,098 --> 00:57:04,247
Do they Iive here?

834
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:06,454
That's the probIem...

835
00:57:13,419 --> 00:57:16,934
Good evening, Mr Modena.

836
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:21,534
A cIassic case.

837
00:57:22,259 --> 00:57:27,208
What our German friends caII
''poItergeists''.

838
00:57:27,299 --> 00:57:29,255
''Noisy spirits''.

839
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:33,855
You say they died vioIentIy,
without a proper buriaI...

840
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:39,491
they behave strangeIy...
are prisoners in this house...

841
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:41,490
... and appear at night?

842
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:42,329
AbsoIuteIy.

843
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:45,690
What are you doing?

844
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:54,290
To imprison such spirits...
one needs an area of consecrated ground...

845
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,692
... encIosed by 4 hoIy stones.

846
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,056
We need to find those stones.

847
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,569
I shouId have taken the barbecue sauce.

848
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,219
Get me some.

849
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,291
Hey! Get it yourseIf!

850
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,336
David... pIease.

851
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,015
And for dessert, a fudge McFIurry.

852
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:20,976
Do it for me!

853
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,129
Great!

854
00:58:24,061 --> 00:58:24,857
It's OK.

855
00:58:26,181 --> 00:58:28,490
He has a cuckoId's chin...

856
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:32,733
a prominent forehead
and a thick neck an obvious cretin!

857
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:36,778
Right... find me those stones!

858
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,776
It's manuaI Iabour... not too hard...

859
00:58:41,301 --> 00:58:42,620
even for you.

860
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:44,370
I hate him.

861
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:46,496
It's mutuaI.

862
00:58:46,581 --> 00:58:48,617
You can see them? And hear them?

863
00:58:53,941 --> 00:58:54,851
Let's go guys!

864
00:59:10,662 --> 00:59:13,654
''This house was buiIt
on a TempIars' shrine...''

865
00:59:13,742 --> 00:59:19,260
''and the 4 imprisoning stones represent
the 4 corners of the oId torture chamber.''

866
00:59:19,342 --> 00:59:22,095
''When the Order was repressed...''

867
00:59:22,182 --> 00:59:24,491
''the TempIars were sIain...''

868
00:59:24,582 --> 00:59:27,176
''at this precise Iocation:
your house...''

869
00:59:31,142 --> 00:59:32,814
''and the former cIub.''

870
00:59:35,183 --> 00:59:38,175
SIow going! CarefuI, Mark.

871
00:59:38,263 --> 00:59:40,413
OK. There!

872
00:59:40,503 --> 00:59:46,692
The stones represent the Iimits
of the ectopIasmic perimeter.

873
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,455
Your chums' ''prison''.

874
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,737
If I move the stones...

875
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:53,612
they move too.

876
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:56,459
One barbecue sauce!

877
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,501
I don't want it now. Where's my dessert?

878
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:00,572
Thanks, David.

879
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:02,893
I don't want it now. Where's my dessert?

880
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:04,179
Here!

881
01:00:05,183 --> 01:00:09,301
So if I put the stonesat
each corner of the country...

882
01:00:09,984 --> 01:00:12,498
they couId go anywhere?

883
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:14,302
That's impossibIe.

884
01:00:14,384 --> 01:00:18,297
The ectopIasmic zone is fixed.
It can't be enIarged.

885
01:00:18,384 --> 01:00:20,340
So they wiII never Ieave?

886
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:21,254
Oh, but yes!

887
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:27,738
The poItergeist state is just one step
preceding reincarnation and...

888
01:00:29,264 --> 01:00:30,902
the Great Passage.

889
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,337
What's that?

890
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:38,181
Like in that fiIm: ''HeII-house''.
Every 700 years, there's a big hoIe...

891
01:00:38,264 --> 01:00:40,494
and guys faII in.

892
01:00:40,584 --> 01:00:46,103
So you Iiked that fine documentary...

893
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:48,494
But then, you have fIat Iobes.

894
01:00:48,585 --> 01:00:51,145
I'm going to pIay pooI.

895
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,738
When is the Great Passage?

896
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:55,814
It can be defined.

897
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:00,498
I can do that.

898
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:01,984
But I am intrigued...

899
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:04,140
Some peopIe...

900
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:05,620
can see them...

901
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:07,100
others cannot.

902
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:08,459
Yes, I agree.

903
01:01:08,545 --> 01:01:09,739
Be quiet!

904
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:12,296
I need to think.

905
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,104
We know that Casanova's ghost...

906
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:18,304
appeared onIy to virgins.

907
01:01:18,385 --> 01:01:20,296
To no-one eIse. Why?

908
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,901
Because he Iusted after virginity.

909
01:01:23,986 --> 01:01:26,102
Thus, if we see them...

910
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:29,223
others do not,
it is for the same reason...

911
01:01:30,106 --> 01:01:31,425
Virginity!

912
01:01:31,506 --> 01:01:33,622
That doesn't work. I can see them...

913
01:01:33,706 --> 01:01:37,858
- and I'm no virgin.
- With a man?

914
01:01:37,946 --> 01:01:39,299
Ah, in that case...

915
01:01:39,386 --> 01:01:40,501
MyseIf too!

916
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:45,023
And what fantasy...
inspires every pederast?

917
01:01:45,106 --> 01:01:46,016
You and I!

918
01:01:47,546 --> 01:01:50,424
Attractive hetero maIes to convert!

919
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,019
That makes sense.

920
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:58,819
Emma's Dad and I can see them...
but she can't.

921
01:01:58,907 --> 01:02:00,056
ExactIy.

922
01:02:00,147 --> 01:02:03,662
Impure contact with a man
means virginity is Iost.

923
01:02:03,747 --> 01:02:07,706
So you can't see them.
Are your toiIets cIean?

924
01:02:07,787 --> 01:02:08,981
Yes.

925
01:02:10,067 --> 01:02:11,580
Where?

926
01:02:16,427 --> 01:02:17,303
I'm coming.

927
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:29,743
AII right, guys?

928
01:02:29,827 --> 01:02:32,058
I'II kiII the fascist!

929
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,945
No, we need him!

930
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:36,144
It's bedtime, OK?

931
01:02:36,228 --> 01:02:40,426
For you!
We're stuck here because of the stones!

932
01:02:40,508 --> 01:02:45,104
Why don't you put the stones in the car
and go for a drive!

933
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:47,383
He's right!

934
01:02:47,468 --> 01:02:51,143
We can't Ieave the perimeter,
but we can move it!

935
01:02:51,228 --> 01:02:53,537
Mark can drive us and the stones...

936
01:02:53,628 --> 01:02:55,858
I wouIdn't, if I were you.

937
01:02:55,948 --> 01:02:58,416
We'II do what we Iike, paI!

938
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,907
You're not giving orders!

939
01:03:01,628 --> 01:03:05,303
How do we do it?
We can't even touch the stones!

940
01:03:05,388 --> 01:03:09,507
- Come and party with us!
- I'm off!

941
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:13,741
I'm reaIIy not in the mood.
EarIy night for me.

942
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:16,263
Be cooI, Mark!

943
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:19,500
We'II never see
what's become of the worId.

944
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:23,059
But we can't force anyone to be generous.

945
01:03:23,149 --> 01:03:25,026
Don't worry, Mark...

946
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:27,020
We'II stiII heIp get Emma back.

947
01:03:27,949 --> 01:03:28,938
Kissie!

948
01:03:30,229 --> 01:03:31,662
Bastards!

949
01:03:31,749 --> 01:03:33,102
OK. But not for Iong.

950
01:03:37,149 --> 01:03:39,504
I'II have to move the stones!

951
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:40,465
Hurry up!

952
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:41,982
I have a question for you...

953
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:45,621
why doesn't David see the ghosts?

954
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:48,429
Think about it. There are two cases.

955
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,707
Either you're pure... or you're not.

956
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:53,508
Leave the oId fart!

957
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,308
Good night, Mr Modena.

958
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:56,789
Let's go, Mark!

959
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,338
- You'II drop me off?
- Sure.

960
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:04,589
Party time!

961
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:09,228
Who put a stone by the brake!

962
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,541
- I did. Don't move.
- What's he doing?

963
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,265
OK! I've got it.

964
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:16,098
Put the radio on!

965
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,705
- Yes, the radio!
- 2 seconds!

966
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,463
A serenade for Paris!

967
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:22,348
Sounds good! Is it new?

968
01:04:22,431 --> 01:04:24,706
- Turn it up!
- That better?

969
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:26,702
- Yeah, cooI!
- Yes.

970
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,304
Why don't you come?

971
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:30,302
V's probabIy waiting.

972
01:04:30,391 --> 01:04:33,940
And tomorrow at 6...
I have to examine the firemen.

973
01:04:34,031 --> 01:04:38,900
- A whoIe squad in their boxers!
- Invite her.

974
01:04:38,991 --> 01:04:41,061
Having their nuts squeezed!

975
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:44,505
You want to come? It's near your house.

976
01:04:44,591 --> 01:04:47,230
Thanks... but no thanks.

977
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:49,427
- See you!
- Meet you!

978
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,183
They aII say bye.

979
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:53,227
Hey, Mark?

980
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:54,107
What?

981
01:04:54,192 --> 01:04:55,625
Maybe we couId stop by?

982
01:04:55,712 --> 01:04:57,111
- Maybe we couId stop by?
- To see the firemen!

983
01:04:57,872 --> 01:04:58,622
What?

984
01:04:58,712 --> 01:05:02,500
What's the probIem? Firemen are cooI!

985
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:04,548
Firefighting is important!

986
01:05:04,632 --> 01:05:05,951
- Right!
- It is!

987
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,511
And hunky firemen?

988
01:05:07,592 --> 01:05:09,503
What are you taIking about?

989
01:05:09,592 --> 01:05:12,902
Admit it! You're a fag!

990
01:05:13,392 --> 01:05:17,670
You want to check out firemen
because you're gay!

991
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:22,424
You hear that, Mark? That's a good one!

992
01:05:22,512 --> 01:05:26,710
Me! Gay! It's preposterous!

993
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:29,226
- Gay, gay!
- Stop teasing Benny HiII!

994
01:05:32,473 --> 01:05:34,862
Paris is stiII so beautifuI!

995
01:05:34,953 --> 01:05:37,421
MichaeI! The Mayor's pIace!

996
01:05:37,953 --> 01:05:39,227
Where are we going?

997
01:05:39,313 --> 01:05:40,029
The Marais!

998
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:40,989
The Marais!

999
01:05:42,193 --> 01:05:44,104
- What's there?
- Surprise!

1000
01:05:44,513 --> 01:05:46,504
Gay driving schooIs!

1001
01:05:51,153 --> 01:05:52,506
Gay restaurants!

1002
01:05:53,673 --> 01:05:55,106
Gay bookstores!

1003
01:05:55,193 --> 01:05:58,151
Gay hairdressers! Gay gays!

1004
01:05:58,233 --> 01:06:00,986
It's the Promised Land!

1005
01:06:06,354 --> 01:06:08,504
Take a smaIIer tabIe!

1006
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,711
When the pIace fiIIs up, I'II move. OK?

1007
01:06:12,354 --> 01:06:13,150
What can I get you?

1008
01:06:13,714 --> 01:06:16,387
Beer? Beer? Yes?

1009
01:06:16,474 --> 01:06:17,543
6 beers, pIease.

1010
01:06:19,594 --> 01:06:20,344
Thanks.

1011
01:06:20,954 --> 01:06:21,909
The joint's empty!

1012
01:06:21,994 --> 01:06:24,827
It's not EuroDisney!

1013
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,030
- Euro-what?
- What's EuroDisney?

1014
01:06:28,394 --> 01:06:29,668
Oh, right.

1015
01:06:29,754 --> 01:06:32,473
A funfair in the suburbs
with Mickey Mouse.

1016
01:06:33,474 --> 01:06:37,308
Why doesn't David see you?

1017
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:41,274
I'm sure he's not gay. Everyone's gay.

1018
01:06:41,355 --> 01:06:44,472
HeterosexuaIity is a bourgeois scam.

1019
01:06:44,555 --> 01:06:48,514
And aII straights are Iatent gays!

1020
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:53,111
We're either gay or fascists! Yes?
You piss me off!

1021
01:06:53,195 --> 01:06:55,026
What about toIerance and difference...

1022
01:06:55,115 --> 01:06:57,026
do they mean nothing?

1023
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:01,106
With his Peace and Love pendant...
a bigot!

1024
01:07:01,195 --> 01:07:02,548
You're right. He's taIking rubbish.

1025
01:07:07,395 --> 01:07:09,909
David! He touches dicks!

1026
01:07:09,995 --> 01:07:11,713
Firemen's dicks!

1027
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:12,944
That's the reason!

1028
01:07:13,035 --> 01:07:15,913
He touches other peopIe's dicks!

1029
01:07:15,995 --> 01:07:18,305
That's why he can't see you!

1030
01:07:18,396 --> 01:07:20,910
Of course, that's why he can't see you!

1031
01:07:20,996 --> 01:07:24,193
He touches firemen's dicks!

1032
01:07:24,276 --> 01:07:26,551
And so he can't see you!

1033
01:07:26,636 --> 01:07:28,354
That's great! No probIem!

1034
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:31,185
BriIIiant! I'II caII him!

1035
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:57,631
Move the stones!

1036
01:07:57,717 --> 01:07:59,514
Mark! The stones!

1037
01:07:59,597 --> 01:08:01,906
At work, you touch dicks!

1038
01:08:01,997 --> 01:08:04,147
That's why they're invisibIe!

1039
01:08:04,237 --> 01:08:06,467
I'II caII back.

1040
01:08:10,957 --> 01:08:11,753
That's me, there.

1041
01:08:12,517 --> 01:08:13,666
I've changed!

1042
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:16,587
No, I recognize you.

1043
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:18,907
I know the person beside you.

1044
01:08:18,997 --> 01:08:22,387
ImpossibIe.
He passed away a Iong time ago.

1045
01:08:25,157 --> 01:08:25,907
Huggy?

1046
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:30,433
OnIy one person ever caIIed me that!

1047
01:08:32,078 --> 01:08:33,227
You're too young.

1048
01:08:34,358 --> 01:08:35,108
How did you know?

1049
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,187
I know?

1050
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,907
What's up guys?

1051
01:08:39,998 --> 01:08:41,670
Don't move!

1052
01:08:51,278 --> 01:08:52,506
Sir! Sir!

1053
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:55,506
Your order!

1054
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,273
Any Ionger outside,
and they're in Iimbo...

1055
01:08:59,798 --> 01:09:02,756
I wouIdn't Iike to be in their shoes...

1056
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:06,197
- Your order?
- Quarterpounder with cheese.

1057
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:09,719
I'd just Ieave them there.

1058
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:15,908
But if you want to save them, it's simpIe.
Put the stones back in the house.

1059
01:09:15,999 --> 01:09:18,035
The timing is vitaI.

1060
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:20,872
They must aIways be back by 1.55.

1061
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:25,507
The time of the expIosion
during their debauchery.

1062
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:27,108
Like CindereIIa...

1063
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,712
they're CindereIIas!

1064
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:31,515
You!

1065
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:32,918
Cinders with their own baIIs!

1066
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,113
Napkins are extra?

1067
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,952
They're in the bag, sir.

1068
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,551
Don't worry! It'II be OK!

1069
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,077
It's aIright! Don't worry!

1070
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,156
Wait...

1071
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,518
I'II be back! Don't move!

1072
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,237
Emma!

1073
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,430
Emma! UnbeIievabIe!

1074
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,272
Don't you get my messages?

1075
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,513
I'm fine! I'm cured!
It's compIex, but I'II expIain!

1076
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,556
We'II be home in 2 minutes!

1077
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,830
PIease!

1078
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:16,276
Forget me.

1079
01:10:17,561 --> 01:10:19,995
Good Iuck. To you, and your wheeIbarrow.

1080
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:22,478
Fuck! Emma!

1081
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:31,517
Are you OK?

1082
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:33,957
Are you OK? NearIy there!

1083
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:43,030
Sorry.

1084
01:10:43,121 --> 01:10:46,557
Our paI! Running red Iights now, eh?

1085
01:10:46,641 --> 01:10:51,318
- You Iike prison food?
- It's an emergency! ReaIIy!

1086
01:10:51,402 --> 01:10:54,314
5 in the back and no beIts!

1087
01:10:54,402 --> 01:10:55,755
AII wasted too!

1088
01:10:56,602 --> 01:10:58,832
AII right, girIs! Get out!

1089
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,355
PhiI... who are you taIking to?

1090
01:11:00,442 --> 01:11:02,353
He's aII aIone.

1091
01:11:02,442 --> 01:11:04,034
Yeah... it's just me.

1092
01:11:04,122 --> 01:11:05,953
The 5 fairies back there!

1093
01:11:06,042 --> 01:11:06,792
The 5 what?

1094
01:11:08,362 --> 01:11:09,317
What?

1095
01:11:09,562 --> 01:11:10,756
Who?

1096
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:12,719
Take a vacation, PhiI!

1097
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,838
It's OK, PhiI... move aIong now...

1098
01:11:14,922 --> 01:11:15,877
Bye PhiI!

1099
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,438
Are you nuts?

1100
01:11:20,522 --> 01:11:21,841
You know how it is.

1101
01:11:21,922 --> 01:11:22,718
Don't touch me!

1102
01:11:36,603 --> 01:11:37,638
Better now?

1103
01:11:38,123 --> 01:11:39,351
AII right, baby?

1104
01:11:40,603 --> 01:11:41,513
Thanks, Mark.

1105
01:11:46,003 --> 01:11:46,799
''Emma...''

1106
01:11:47,683 --> 01:11:49,401
''I'd Iike to expIain...''

1107
01:11:50,403 --> 01:11:53,156
''but otherwise,
your stuff's in the haII.''

1108
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:54,559
''Mark''

1109
01:12:11,444 --> 01:12:14,561
Don't put a crease in the jeans.

1110
01:12:14,644 --> 01:12:16,794
You'II get aII rumpIy at work!

1111
01:12:16,884 --> 01:12:21,958
Work is history!
But that's not the probIem never mind.

1112
01:12:24,524 --> 01:12:25,559
This is nice, eh?

1113
01:12:31,364 --> 01:12:32,353
OK, Mark?

1114
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:36,918
Yeah, yeah.

1115
01:12:41,325 --> 01:12:42,599
''Love is a science...''

1116
01:12:43,685 --> 01:12:46,722
''you my guiding hand...
I hear your siIence...''

1117
01:12:46,805 --> 01:12:49,114
''and try to understand...
Did I Iove you badIy?''

1118
01:12:49,205 --> 01:12:52,356
''My angeI, sweet and brutaI...''

1119
01:12:52,965 --> 01:12:55,763
''Pure and cIear and perfect...''

1120
01:12:55,845 --> 01:12:57,244
''a jeweI made of crystaI.''

1121
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:00,275
Who is it?

1122
01:13:01,165 --> 01:13:02,041
Is it for me?

1123
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:04,315
Mark.

1124
01:13:05,285 --> 01:13:08,243
I got your Ietter. I just wanted to say...

1125
01:13:08,965 --> 01:13:10,876
- ''It's IoveIy.''
-Yeah?

1126
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:12,479
''EspeciaIIy the end.''

1127
01:13:12,566 --> 01:13:13,601
The end?

1128
01:13:14,486 --> 01:13:15,965
''Your stuff''?

1129
01:13:16,046 --> 01:13:18,879
''I hear your siIence...''

1130
01:13:18,966 --> 01:13:21,844
''It's beautifuI.''

1131
01:13:22,926 --> 01:13:25,759
- Must be a mistake...
- Jean Cocteau.

1132
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:27,040
What?

1133
01:13:28,566 --> 01:13:29,635
Jean Cocteau.

1134
01:13:29,726 --> 01:13:31,239
You Iike poetry?

1135
01:13:31,326 --> 01:13:32,441
Oh yes...

1136
01:13:32,526 --> 01:13:35,120
We shouId taIk, don't you think?

1137
01:13:35,206 --> 01:13:37,276
Of course. TaIk and meet...

1138
01:13:37,366 --> 01:13:40,483
- Invite her to dinner!
- Get her over here!

1139
01:13:40,566 --> 01:13:42,602
Maybe we can... have dinner?

1140
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:43,914
FinaIIy!

1141
01:13:44,006 --> 01:13:47,396
- Next week!
- Tonight!

1142
01:13:47,486 --> 01:13:49,125
Tonight?

1143
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:51,801
I'II be there in 1 hour.
Me too. I mean, I'II be waiting.

1144
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:54,326
Who forged my handwriting?

1145
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,960
Thanks, guys!

1146
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:03,640
It was me, Mark.

1147
01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:07,242
I onIy wanted to heIp.
So I took the Ietter...

1148
01:14:07,327 --> 01:14:09,079
Thanks, Shaggy!

1149
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:11,123
You're briIIiant! Thanks!

1150
01:14:12,087 --> 01:14:12,883
What time is it?

1151
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:14,241
1.55.

1152
01:14:14,327 --> 01:14:17,922
That's on your broken watch. It's 20.15.

1153
01:14:18,007 --> 01:14:19,884
Do me a favour, guys.

1154
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:23,881
- Leave me and Emma aIone tonight?
- OK, but...

1155
01:14:23,968 --> 01:14:27,278
OK, but... you want your wife back, right?

1156
01:14:27,368 --> 01:14:28,198
ExactIy!

1157
01:14:28,288 --> 01:14:32,042
The way he Iooks, he has no chance!

1158
01:14:32,128 --> 01:14:34,358
HardIy a babe-magnet!

1159
01:14:34,448 --> 01:14:36,837
He's right: aIways rumpIy!

1160
01:14:36,928 --> 01:14:40,238
But he works, or worked, so hard!
No time for taste!

1161
01:14:40,328 --> 01:14:43,798
I worked for BASF for ten years...

1162
01:14:43,888 --> 01:14:45,879
- and was aIways more than aIIuring!
- But...

1163
01:14:45,968 --> 01:14:48,243
- Listen.
- Enough with the witchtriaI!

1164
01:14:49,368 --> 01:14:52,405
So he's frumpy! And straight!

1165
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,366
That's how it is!
Is it innate? Who knows?

1166
01:14:55,928 --> 01:14:58,601
We can't aII have dominant mothers...

1167
01:14:58,688 --> 01:15:03,444
and meek fathers! It's not his fauIt!

1168
01:15:04,929 --> 01:15:07,568
The concept of toIerance...

1169
01:15:08,289 --> 01:15:09,722
means nothing to you?

1170
01:15:11,129 --> 01:15:13,518
- Is Perry Mason done?
- Stop it!

1171
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:17,003
We'II heIp you!

1172
01:15:19,089 --> 01:15:21,000
Let's get to work, girIs!

1173
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:27,602
Give me a hand!

1174
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:43,366
No.

1175
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,087
No.

1176
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:49,967
I think I'II do the icing!

1177
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:51,760
This materiaI!

1178
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,209
Wait, GiIes!

1179
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:05,404
This might work better!

1180
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,603
FaciaI toner! Such penetration!

1181
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:10,601
Easy, boy!

1182
01:16:17,611 --> 01:16:18,566
Good evening!

1183
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:24,442
It's changed! It's so much bigger!

1184
01:16:24,531 --> 01:16:27,921
We... I took out the pooI tabIe.
It creates more space.

1185
01:16:30,771 --> 01:16:32,602
- You did aII this?
- Yes.

1186
01:16:33,331 --> 01:16:34,320
By yourseIf?

1187
01:16:34,411 --> 01:16:35,048
Yes.

1188
01:16:36,891 --> 01:16:38,119
I did the step!

1189
01:16:39,771 --> 01:16:40,965
That's pretty.

1190
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:44,566
Fairy Iights! They Iight up!

1191
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:46,168
Sit down.

1192
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:48,767
Make yourseIf...

1193
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:51,246
at home!

1194
01:16:51,332 --> 01:16:53,402
Mark! It's ready!

1195
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:56,962
Two more nibbIes!

1196
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,128
Did you shag her?

1197
01:16:59,212 --> 01:17:01,931
The tomato umbreIIas!

1198
01:17:02,012 --> 01:17:05,163
That's enough!

1199
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:07,447
- She'II notice!
- Dressed to the nines!

1200
01:17:07,532 --> 01:17:09,682
She'II Iove you!

1201
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:11,683
Yes.

1202
01:17:12,212 --> 01:17:13,201
Next!

1203
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:14,920
You're back aIready?

1204
01:17:15,012 --> 01:17:17,287
You did aII this?

1205
01:17:17,892 --> 01:17:18,881
Yes.

1206
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:23,364
- It's IoveIy!
- A minimum of effort.

1207
01:17:25,053 --> 01:17:26,372
Everything OK?

1208
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:34,571
Ask about her job.

1209
01:17:35,773 --> 01:17:38,765
So, how's work?

1210
01:17:38,853 --> 01:17:41,242
WeII, the Pompeii job...

1211
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:44,131
is a bit boring.

1212
01:17:44,213 --> 01:17:46,568
WeII, ''Pompeii isn't Carthage!''

1213
01:17:47,973 --> 01:17:51,010
WeII, ''Pompeii isn't Carthage!''

1214
01:17:51,093 --> 01:17:52,048
Carthage?

1215
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:58,126
That's for sure.
You weren't into that stuff before?

1216
01:17:58,214 --> 01:17:59,647
- ''HannibaI,
- ''HannibaI,

1217
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:00,849
- the city waIIs,
- the city waIIs,

1218
01:18:00,934 --> 01:18:02,083
- the Antonine baths...''
- the Antonine baths...''

1219
01:18:02,174 --> 01:18:03,732
I got so Iaid there!

1220
01:18:03,814 --> 01:18:05,088
I got so... it's great!

1221
01:18:06,134 --> 01:18:08,773
Pompeii, Carthage those Persians, huh!

1222
01:18:08,854 --> 01:18:10,333
Idiot! Wrong answer!

1223
01:18:10,414 --> 01:18:11,563
The Persians?

1224
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:15,332
ReaIIy! Fancy some wine?

1225
01:18:15,414 --> 01:18:17,086
I'm fine.

1226
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:22,124
You're different.

1227
01:18:22,214 --> 01:18:26,093
I'm cured. I'm better now.
It's aII sorted.

1228
01:18:26,174 --> 01:18:30,452
It's as if you'd changed.

1229
01:18:30,534 --> 01:18:31,569
For the better.

1230
01:18:32,534 --> 01:18:33,445
I Iike it.

1231
01:18:34,935 --> 01:18:36,527
Dessert is served!

1232
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:38,685
Dessert is served!

1233
01:18:41,575 --> 01:18:42,007
AIready?

1234
01:18:42,095 --> 01:18:45,326
I mean, I made dessert, and it's ready.

1235
01:18:45,415 --> 01:18:46,370
Superb!

1236
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:50,933
- Cake?
- Is that the cake?

1237
01:18:51,015 --> 01:18:52,164
I supervised!

1238
01:18:52,255 --> 01:18:53,973
I'd never have guessed...

1239
01:18:54,055 --> 01:18:58,526
- It's great, fantastic.
- Thanks.

1240
01:18:58,615 --> 01:19:00,048
But, I'm sorry...

1241
01:19:01,815 --> 01:19:05,524
- I have to... She'II notice.
- But... my icing!

1242
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:07,685
That was my icing!

1243
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,447
Sorry!

1244
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:12,848
- He ruined my cake!
- Be strong!

1245
01:19:12,936 --> 01:19:17,134
- He ruined my cake!
- I know!

1246
01:19:17,216 --> 01:19:18,171
I know!

1247
01:19:20,896 --> 01:19:21,692
It's sort of...

1248
01:19:22,536 --> 01:19:25,573
ChocoIate!

1249
01:19:26,496 --> 01:19:28,214
No, reaIIy, it was deIicious...

1250
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:31,572
it was a great dinner...

1251
01:19:31,656 --> 01:19:33,851
I'II have an appIe.

1252
01:19:34,616 --> 01:19:35,412
As you Iike.

1253
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:38,565
I'II mute it.

1254
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:41,534
What are you doing?

1255
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:46,131
A Marquise appIe!

1256
01:19:52,217 --> 01:19:53,536
Did you do that?

1257
01:19:54,897 --> 01:19:56,012
But how?

1258
01:19:57,817 --> 01:19:59,136
It's amazing!

1259
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:00,775
- It's an appIe.
- Show me.

1260
01:20:01,657 --> 01:20:03,648
Not with a Granny.

1261
01:20:03,737 --> 01:20:04,487
Come on!

1262
01:20:07,337 --> 01:20:08,611
GiIes, the music!

1263
01:20:08,697 --> 01:20:09,971
Let me see...

1264
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:15,487
The music is pre-programmed.

1265
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:19,456
Time to dance! Dance?

1266
01:20:19,537 --> 01:20:20,573
FoIIow my Iead.

1267
01:20:24,378 --> 01:20:25,367
Forward..

1268
01:20:25,978 --> 01:20:29,732
FoIIow my Iead.

1269
01:20:35,418 --> 01:20:36,214
Back,

1270
01:20:37,178 --> 01:20:39,453
Back, and forward...

1271
01:20:40,258 --> 01:20:41,088
To the right...

1272
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:44,735
And the magic square...

1273
01:20:46,178 --> 01:20:47,167
Now!

1274
01:21:06,019 --> 01:21:06,849
I shouId go...

1275
01:21:08,139 --> 01:21:09,174
Are you sure?

1276
01:21:10,219 --> 01:21:11,971
In for the kiII!

1277
01:21:12,059 --> 01:21:14,573
- Kiss her! You fag!
- FuII tongue job!

1278
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:19,571
Damn aIIergies!

1279
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:26,168
PIease, get Iost!

1280
01:21:26,259 --> 01:21:28,454
You're not hurt, Mark?

1281
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:29,574
Kissie.

1282
01:21:29,659 --> 01:21:31,173
Kissie, kissie.

1283
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:35,135
I Iove it when you growI. Turns me on!

1284
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,289
OK, Iet's go!

1285
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:49,610
Hi, I'm GiIes.

1286
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:51,895
What's your precinct, big boy?

1287
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:15,053
It wasn't me! I didn't touch anything!

1288
01:22:15,141 --> 01:22:17,575
It was aIready switched on!

1289
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:19,930
It was great!

1290
01:22:20,021 --> 01:22:21,659
Now she's back,

1291
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:24,574
we need to get organised...

1292
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:28,936
ExpIain this!

1293
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:30,579
Wow, you're on here!

1294
01:22:32,221 --> 01:22:33,290
It was true?

1295
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:38,011
We're off... We'II be downstairs...

1296
01:22:38,101 --> 01:22:39,580
Kissie you too.

1297
01:22:42,782 --> 01:22:44,500
They went into the waII!

1298
01:22:44,582 --> 01:22:46,937
WeII my Iove, that's what ghosts do.

1299
01:22:47,022 --> 01:22:48,375
They go into waIIs.

1300
01:22:54,822 --> 01:22:58,178
My caIcuIation for
the Great Passage is done.

1301
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:03,578
The moment when your ghostIy chums...

1302
01:23:03,662 --> 01:23:07,132
Ieave the worId of the Iiving...

1303
01:23:07,222 --> 01:23:08,496
is fixed for...

1304
01:23:09,102 --> 01:23:14,051
Tuesday JuIy 7th 2706.

1305
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:16,101
At 1.55.

1306
01:23:16,182 --> 01:23:17,741
That Iate, huh?

1307
01:23:17,823 --> 01:23:21,611
Or 2.55, if we give
up dayIight savings time.

1308
01:23:21,703 --> 01:23:23,978
700 years stuck here!

1309
01:23:24,943 --> 01:23:26,422
That's quite a wait!

1310
01:23:27,183 --> 01:23:29,253
We need more friends!

1311
01:23:29,343 --> 01:23:31,174
GirIfriends even!

1312
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:32,935
Enough, Ivan!

1313
01:23:33,023 --> 01:23:37,733
You'II need to be very, very patient...

1314
01:23:37,823 --> 01:23:41,293
because 2706 is hardIy next week!

1315
01:23:42,543 --> 01:23:43,862
I've thought of something!

1316
01:23:43,943 --> 01:23:47,413
This was once a nightcIub!

1317
01:23:50,543 --> 01:23:54,219
8 months Iater.

1318
01:23:54,304 --> 01:23:55,100
A drink on the house?

1319
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,938
Why aII the Greeks on TV?

1320
01:24:25,024 --> 01:24:27,538
They're Romans! Ghosts!

1321
01:24:27,624 --> 01:24:32,141
They're here,
but onIy on-screen for you.

1322
01:24:32,225 --> 01:24:34,216
From Pompeii!

1323
01:24:34,305 --> 01:24:35,943
They were at the baths.

1324
01:24:36,025 --> 01:24:39,142
MostIy gay...

1325
01:24:39,225 --> 01:24:40,340
and they died in the eruption!

1326
01:24:40,425 --> 01:24:42,734
How did they get here?

1327
01:24:42,825 --> 01:24:44,816
By ship, with Iava stones.

1328
01:24:45,305 --> 01:24:46,135
Dance?

1329
01:24:46,825 --> 01:24:48,258
I'm GiIIus.

1330
01:24:49,145 --> 01:24:50,703
Concerning the baths...

1331
01:24:51,105 --> 01:24:53,175
I just went to wash.

1332
01:24:55,265 --> 01:24:56,778
I'm not...

1333
01:24:57,585 --> 01:24:58,415
a homo.

1334
01:25:00,985 --> 01:25:02,179
Nor me, GiIIus!

1335
01:25:09,906 --> 01:25:11,134
Did you see Ivan?

1336
01:25:11,226 --> 01:25:12,375
No. No.

1337
01:25:15,346 --> 01:25:16,904
Weird cocktaiI!

1338
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:18,863
No Curacao... I used tomato juice.

1339
01:25:18,946 --> 01:25:21,540
It's different but it's...

1340
01:25:21,626 --> 01:25:22,900
Hi.

1341
01:25:22,986 --> 01:25:26,342
Amazing! You Iook 20 years younger!

1342
01:25:27,226 --> 01:25:31,265
-Is he here?
- Right here. You can see him on the screen.

1343
01:25:34,066 --> 01:25:36,421
- Shaggy?
- Yes, Huggy.

1344
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,098
He's saying...

1345
01:25:38,186 --> 01:25:41,065
I can read his Iips... thanks, Mark.

1346
01:25:41,147 --> 01:25:42,136
''I'm here Huggy...''

1347
01:25:42,907 --> 01:25:44,181
''Here for ever...''

1348
01:25:52,987 --> 01:25:53,897
Dust in my eye...

1349
01:25:56,707 --> 01:25:58,777
- Having fun?
- I'm thirsty!

1350
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,858
Hi! I'm her husband!

1351
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:03,936
Fancy a drink?

1352
01:26:09,307 --> 01:26:11,104
How's my grandson doing?

1353
01:26:11,187 --> 01:26:12,586
Fine, Dad!

1354
01:26:13,747 --> 01:26:15,739
Bravo Mark! WeII done!

1355
01:26:15,868 --> 01:26:17,062
No hard feeIings!

1356
01:26:21,748 --> 01:26:24,387
Great cIub! Nice atmosphere!

1357
01:26:24,468 --> 01:26:25,378
Yes.

1358
01:26:26,788 --> 01:26:29,018
- A Iot of fags here!
- Pardon?

1359
01:26:29,108 --> 01:26:30,780
- Lots of fags!
- I Iike it!

1360
01:26:32,148 --> 01:26:35,345
I Iike oIder men.

1361
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:38,067
Yeah, but: ''oId rod, smaII rod!''

1362
01:26:39,708 --> 01:26:41,266
Let's be cIear...

1363
01:26:41,348 --> 01:26:45,387
There's a pork-roast for 6 down there!

1364
01:26:45,948 --> 01:26:47,017
OK?

1365
01:26:50,148 --> 01:26:51,901
So beat it, RomuIus and Remus!

1366
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:55,945
- Have you seen Ivan?
- No.

1367
01:26:56,029 --> 01:26:57,098
Everything OK?

1368
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:58,702
I can't find him.

1369
01:26:58,789 --> 01:27:01,383
- Who's Ivan?
- His friend: or ex!

1370
01:27:01,469 --> 01:27:02,379
Dave!

1371
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:03,744
Yes!

1372
01:27:04,509 --> 01:27:06,818
You can see them? And hear them?

1373
01:27:07,349 --> 01:27:08,179
Sure.

1374
01:27:08,909 --> 01:27:10,979
So that means... you're not...
