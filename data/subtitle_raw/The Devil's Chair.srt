1
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:20,781
Right, though.

2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,662
Let's kick this off, then, eh?

3
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,455
Once upon a time...

4
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,373
Once upon a time.

5
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,125
Anyway, once upon a time, yeah?

6
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:35,046
Okay.

7
00:00:35,972 --> 00:00:40,930
Well, let me tell you about
getting fucked over by your demons.

8
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:44,892
How, eventually,
they're gonna catch up with you...

9
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:46,606
...tear you to pieces.

10
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:59,735
Let me tell you about him and her,
and her and him.

11
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:05,333
These poor good people,
and what happened to them.

12
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:10,039
It's quite sad, really,
to see how it all ended up.

13
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:12,088
How they all ended up.

14
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,841
Pulped on the floor
in that god-awful fucking place...

15
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:20,923
... With their guts spewed, hanging out,
dissected, dismembered.

16
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:26,479
Deceased.

17
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:28,439
Fucking dead.

18
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:30,399
Fucked.

19
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,527
It didn't end up good. It didn't...

20
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,816
Oh, it didn't end up good, you know.

21
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:39,565
Come on,
that's a fucking understatement.

22
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,404
I mean,
they meant the best for me...

23
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,913
... But, well, real life
doesn't have a happy ending.

24
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:48,534
At least
they don't have to live with it.

25
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:51,582
Because if there's one true victim
to be had from all this...

26
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,915
... I'll be perfectly honest with you...

27
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,800
...it's me.

28
00:01:57,262 --> 00:01:59,053
It is me.

29
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:04,182
My name's Nick West, by the way.

30
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:06,384
We should rewind here.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,851
I wanna tell you how it began
so innocently.

32
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,694
No one understood.
No one knew how deep all this ran.

33
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:15,562
I really wanna tell you
how it all went down.

34
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,897
If you stick with me,
it'll be worth your while.

35
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:20,903
Yeah, I didn't...

36
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,785
This is Sammy.

37
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:25,362
Hot fucking Sammy.

38
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:30,245
Sweet, sweet girl.
Fucking beautiful.

39
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,421
Sexy, filthy.

40
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,417
We're gonna get off our fucking nut.

41
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,172
I won't bore you with the details.

42
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:42,263
She's not gonna be around
long enough for them to matter.

43
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:44,433
I guess you've seen Hellraiser.

44
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,934
I'm guessing you've seen those kinds
of films. Pumpkinhead or whatever.

45
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:50,595
That's probably
why you're watching this now.

46
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,526
But after what happened
and what we found that day...

47
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:57,482
... Well, I wish I'd shown
a little more interest, you know...

48
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,732
... Paid more attention.

49
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:03,195
I might've learned something.

50
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,113
Nice.

51
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:07,530
Welcome to the asylum, baby.

52
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:09,700
I do what I can, you know.

53
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,579
First impressions: -

54
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,131
Fucking shithole.

55
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:18,129
So, what do you think of this place?

56
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:22,170
I guess the cleaner
must've pulled a sicky, eh?

57
00:03:22,347 --> 00:03:24,304
Cunt's dead.

58
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,388
Yeah, cunt must be dead.

59
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:29,850
- Stupid bitch.
- Why so vexed about this...

60
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:32,145
I wouldn't say Sammy was easy,
you know.

61
00:03:32,316 --> 00:03:36,776
But she wasn't exactly hard
to crackeither.

62
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:39,899
So are we gonna fuck
or are we gonna sightsee?

63
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:43,656
You know, couple of drinks,
few tabs...

64
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:46,152
... You stand a good chance
of a happy ending.

65
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,821
Romantic cunt, aren't you?

66
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,577
Oh, you got something.

67
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,081
Got something for you.

68
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:56,839
Wish you had a zipper.

69
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,165
Why don't you take a look at these?

70
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:00,753
What's that?

71
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,676
That's a little piece of magic, baby.

72
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:07,424
Acid? Come on, Nick, not here.

73
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,632
Come on.

74
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,850
Open your fucking mouth.

75
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:13,056
I'll stick a knife in your ass...

76
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,853
...you won't be able to sit down
for six weeks.

77
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:17,686
Okay.

78
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:20,066
Tongue.

79
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,699
One for you and one for me.

80
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:35,284
You're so fucking beautiful.

81
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:37,879
And you're fucking filthy too.

82
00:04:38,048 --> 00:04:39,840
What you doing
with a lunatic like me?

83
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,669
I like weirdos.

84
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:44,543
I like the fact you like weirdos.

85
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:48,675
Come on, let's go see
how fucking crazy this place is now.

86
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:53,644
What the fuck is that?

87
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,353
Fucking hell. Fuck, look at that.

88
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:01,320
What the fuck?

89
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:02,947
What is that?

90
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,950
Now, that's the fucking reason
why we came here.

91
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:10,579
- Is that real?
- It's fucking real, you tit.

92
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:13,702
Wait, I know, I know, I know.

93
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:15,584
It's a fucking chair.

94
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:16,867
Big deal, right?

95
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,130
Well, all I can say is,
things aren't always what they seem.

96
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,498
Get in it. Go on.

97
00:05:23,427 --> 00:05:26,761
- This is weird.
- Just sit in it.

98
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:30,300
- Go on, just get in it.
- It's just all the metal just lying around.

99
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:32,967
- Short and sweet.
- Let me tie you down.

100
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:35,019
So beautiful.

101
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:37,475
So, so beautiful.

102
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,271
Get my cock out. Get my cock out.

103
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:42,236
Suck me.

104
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,277
Come on. Deep, deep, deep.

105
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:50,990
Look at the dirty little rotter.

106
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:54,283
Sucking me till the 12th of never.

107
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:58,789
I want a go.
Come on, let me have a go.

108
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:06,042
I wanna see you fuck yourself. I'll be
the marquis, you can be my little slut.

109
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,130
I'm gonna fuck your mouth.

110
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:13,641
You look amazing.
You look beautiful.

111
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,560
The moment
before it all changed forever.

112
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:20,524
The moment before life fucked me
once and for all...

113
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:23,896
... And ripped out
whatever was left of my heart.

114
00:06:24,322 --> 00:06:28,984
However you wanna say it,
it was fucked, it was stamped on.

115
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:33,655
It was done. And then, bang.

116
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:37,165
It all got really fucking weird.

117
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:41,702
Baby.

118
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:44,168
Baby.

119
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:46,134
Fuck yourself.

120
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:49,801
Everything from here now
is sort of hazy...

121
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:53,680
... Like a nightmare or a fever dream.

122
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:57,801
Bits and pieces, that's all I've got.
Bits and pieces, that's all I've got.

123
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:04,190
- This is...
- Fuck yourself.

124
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,774
Fuck yourself.

125
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,892
Nick, please help me.

126
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,614
Sammy!

127
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,635
Nick. Nick, no!

128
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,972
Nick.

129
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:01,391
Blood.

130
00:09:01,563 --> 00:09:05,477
Blood all over my hands,
all over my clothes.

131
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,682
Sammy missing...

132
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,858
... And me in the middle of it all,
ranting and raving about a chair.

133
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,565
It's not a big equation.

134
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:19,496
It all adds up
to an indefinite stay in hospital.

135
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,539
Have a guess what.

136
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:26,001
Me, Nick West.

137
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:30,963
I'm criminally insane, apparently.

138
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,547
Pills.

139
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,341
Pills they've got in here
make acid look like aspirin.

140
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:39,428
Just say no, don't do drugs.
Knock them back and swallow.

141
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,680
Don't ask questions.

142
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:44,684
Hi, my name's Nick West.
I'm medicated, how are you?

143
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:47,608
I've been inside for four years.

144
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,445
Four years of pills and bullshit.

145
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:53,649
Rotting in a room
because they don't believe me.

146
00:09:53,824 --> 00:09:54,855
Nick.

147
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,738
Haven't seen it for themselves,
so it can't be true, yeah?

148
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:00,663
I wish they were right.
I wish I was crazy...

149
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,618
... Then there'd be one less psycho
on the streets, right?

150
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,544
And you'd feel safe in your beds.

151
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,834
Only we know that's not the truth.

152
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:14,338
The truth is...

153
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,510
... You're all in danger.

154
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:21,175
When you're trapped in a cell
that long...

155
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:26,476
... You think you're alone, forgotten,
but I wasn't.

156
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,561
Turns out he was watching me,
observing me, pulling my strings.

157
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:34,145
And then one day, he turned a key,
pushed a button.

158
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:36,232
Opened the doors
and let the world in...

159
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,531
... Or me out, I'm not sure.

160
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:49,543
And how do you feel these days,
Nick?

161
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:54,507
I feel healthy. I feel okay.

162
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,503
And the headaches?

163
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,553
They come and go.

164
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:05,183
What about the stories
you told the police?

165
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:07,477
How do you feel about those?

166
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:13,192
I've learned
they were my mind's responses...

167
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:17,526
...to the stress of what happened.

168
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:24,072
It's not uncommon for people
to create...

169
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,127
...fantasies in times of trauma.

170
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:35,419
What do you think the trauma was?

171
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:44,215
I know I'm guilty.

172
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:48,933
There's no other explanation.

173
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:57,487
I just have no memory
of what happened.

174
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:00,825
None at all?

175
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,620
That bothers you?

176
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,160
Of course it does.

177
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:18,834
He was acquitted of murder.

178
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:21,004
He's been a model patient
for four years...

179
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,510
...never putting a foot out of line.

180
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:28,178
Surely you don't think
he's dangerous?

181
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:31,975
To others, no,
but to himself, quite possibly.

182
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,189
He's suffering severe delusions.

183
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,104
Once.

184
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,236
Four years ago.

185
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:39,859
Never since.

186
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,867
I'm not very happy about this. He...

187
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:48,196
I'm not asking you
to just set him loose on the world.

188
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:53,079
I'm asking you
to put him into my care...

189
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:56,333
...so we can find out
what happened to Sammy.

190
00:12:56,507 --> 00:13:02,131
Think about her family,
they deserve to know.

191
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:06,468
And you will take full responsibility
for the consequences?

192
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:09,728
Just show me where to sign.

193
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:19,274
Sign here, walk free.

194
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:22,567
Doesn't matter
that we think you killed someone.

195
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,281
Nick West?

196
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,946
They didn't think very much of me,
sending one guy.

197
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:10,364
I'm here to give you a lift, sir.

198
00:14:10,915 --> 00:14:12,707
No, I'm gonna get the bus.

199
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:16,786
You're not gonna get a bus
around here, sir.

200
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:21,252
Look,
why don't you come with me, sir?

201
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:24,510
Come on, just get in the car.

202
00:14:31,978 --> 00:14:34,267
And just like that...

203
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:37,811
... I was gone.

204
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:42,396
Where are we going?

205
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:46,064
Oh, I'm taking you
to meet someone, sir.

206
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:23,194
Fucking punts.

207
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:25,356
Welcome to Cambridge.

208
00:15:32,456 --> 00:15:34,413
Here we are, then, sir.

209
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:39,537
Just knock and go in.
The doctor is expecting you, sir.

210
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,540
Doctor who?

211
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:48,090
Dr. Willard, sir.

212
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,461
Just go in.

213
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,912
Oh, here we go, Gandalf, slut.

214
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,823
He's half pedo, don't you know?

215
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,127
Melissa, leave us alone, will you?

216
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:22,833
Mr. West and I
have some business to discuss.

217
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:39,272
She's a little worried
leaving me alone with you.

218
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,440
Silly thing.

219
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:42,938
Why am I here?

220
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:48,942
Very well. You have been released,
but under certain conditions.

221
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,570
What conditions?

222
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:55,112
I'm writing a book.

223
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,282
What, do you need a typist?

224
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,628
No, no, no. Oh, no.

225
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,960
I need a subject.

226
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,586
You, Mr. West.

227
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,046
You want to write a book about me?

228
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:13,214
Absolutely.

229
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:17,225
Your situation provides me...

230
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:21,309
...with a fairly unique opportunity.

231
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:26,312
I want to study you
and your psychotic episode...

232
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:31,074
...where the episode itself
took place.

233
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:34,736
What do you mean?

234
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:37,826
The Blackwater Asylum.

235
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:44,122
You are to travel there with me.
Arrangements have been made.

236
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,341
The possibilities of this
on the study...

237
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:52,668
...have got my publisher
really very excited.

238
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,345
You don't know what you're doing.

239
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,006
I can't go back there.

240
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:59,640
Oh, I'm afraid you can.

241
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:04,357
Unless you want to return
to the asylum.

242
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,818
That's blackmail.

243
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:09,944
Yes.

244
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:12,443
No, no.

245
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:15,108
I'm simply asking
for a few days of your time...

246
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:19,948
...in exchange for answers
to questions that plague you daily.

247
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:22,496
Is that too much to ask?

248
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:27,877
Perfect timing.

249
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,500
Nick West, Rachel Fowles.

250
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:35,464
First impressions: Fuck me.

251
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,716
New mission:
Get her out of that outfit.

252
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:40,348
First hard-on in four years.

253
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,222
Pleased to meet you, Nick.

254
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:46,514
Rachel is one of my brightest
psychology students.

255
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:53,239
She's going to be helping me
with the study.

256
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:57,573
So, Nick, it's really great
that you're helping us with this.

257
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,698
Great for who?

258
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,380
So I guess Brett's running late.

259
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:14,381
Shit. Sorry I'm late.

260
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,264
First impressions: -

261
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:23,430
Well, look at the cunt, tosser.
Flat-line tosser.

262
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,930
Brett Wilson. How's it going?

263
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:29,186
- Brett, this is Nick.
- Nick?

264
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,187
- Nick West.
- Oh, yes.

265
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:35,111
I went to school with a Nick West,
but I imagine it wasn't you.

266
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:37,240
Brett, come on.

267
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,403
- What? That was funny.
- Cock.

268
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,536
Come on, just be nice.

269
00:19:41,706 --> 00:19:43,284
Where's your sense of humour?

270
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,949
- He's had a really tough time, okay?
- Oh, has he?

271
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:49,130
- Dr. Willard.
- All right, all right, that's enough.

272
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,425
Melissa will be waiting outside
in the car.

273
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,796
Come on.

274
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:05,135
O my brothers...

275
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,189
... It really was this ridiculous,
like a bad Scooby-Doo.

276
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,192
Five hours of countryside
and educated nothingness.

277
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:17,484
Fine art and the theatre,
croquet and carrot cake.

278
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,488
Houses in France...

279
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:22,781
... And stuff that could never mean
anything to me.

280
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:25,999
Can they not hear themselves?

281
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,211
Their banal conversations
floating through the air...

282
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:32,333
... Like faeces
smeared across a crusty sky.

283
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,876
Sad bunch of vacuous little cunts.

284
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:40,013
With their private- school
educations...

285
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:45,887
... Strong, perfect parents.
Silver- spoon-fed failed models.

286
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:49,930
Preening, perfect, empty.

287
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:52,433
Clueless clown.

288
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:55,317
Poor little me.

289
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:57,229
And Gandalf.

290
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,115
Thank you.

291
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:16,217
Nick, you okay?

292
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,923
Of course I'm not okay, big tits.

293
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,341
Yeah.

294
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:22,553
This is gonna be easier
than you think.

295
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:27,097
Just whenever you're ready,
all right?

296
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:40,234
God.

297
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,420
This is atmospheric.

298
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:36,955
Careful where you tread.

299
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:38,461
No shit.

300
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:40,959
Looks like the maid died.

301
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:44,514
What?

302
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:47,469
Memories washing over me
like a fever...

303
00:22:47,643 --> 00:22:49,137
... Making my head spin.

304
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,230
I started to sweat,
thought I was gonna throw up.

305
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,769
Was a real fucking trip,
and I wasn't having any fun.

306
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,234
Classic. He's having flashbacks.

307
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:03,031
Maybe we should follow him.

308
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,778
There's film in the camera.

309
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:06,826
We could follow him
and get his reactions.

310
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,953
Just leave him.

311
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:22,336
Tell me something, Willard,
am I the only one slightly concerned...

312
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:26,841
...that we've returned to the scene
of the murder with the murderer?

313
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:14,388
Nick.

314
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:23,155
Lot of memories in this place?

315
00:24:25,992 --> 00:24:28,115
Something like that.

316
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,697
You can talk to me, you know.

317
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:36,411
Tell me what happened.

318
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,003
I don't know anymore.

319
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:44,043
It's all right.

320
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:49,341
Come on,
let's get back to the others.

321
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:13,698
Now, I suggest we eat...

322
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,782
...and discuss our reasons
for being here.

323
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:19,038
Melissa,
if you could organise the food...

324
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:20,920
I'll fetch the hamper from the car.

325
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:27,801
I'm just going to take you and Rachel
and show you the room upstairs.

326
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:32,971
Excuse me, Nick,
if you don't mind waiting here...

327
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:55,998
What the hell is this?

328
00:25:56,499 --> 00:26:00,627
This is where the incident
supposedly took place.

329
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:06,794
At his worst point, he claimed that
that was what took his girlfriend.

330
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:13,342
So you know all about
why you're here?

331
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:15,675
I know bits and pieces
that he tells me.

332
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:17,477
And what did he tell you about me?

333
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:20,978
He didn't have to.

334
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:22,524
I know what you are.

335
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:27,153
So you think I'm a murderer,
do you?

336
00:26:27,697 --> 00:26:29,737
I didn't say that.

337
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:42,497
If I were you,
I'd stay well away from me.

338
00:26:44,381 --> 00:26:47,714
Dr. Willard wouldn't put me
in any danger.

339
00:26:49,886 --> 00:26:52,212
He already has.

340
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:10,197
Hold on to this.

341
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,523
- What are you doing?
- Sitting down. What's it look like?

342
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:15,908
- Brett.
- What?

343
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:19,582
Mr. Wilson, get up from there.
That is not a plaything.

344
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:21,915
It's perfectly safe, I'm sure.

345
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:25,545
I mean, how...
- Brett?

346
00:27:26,423 --> 00:27:28,380
Brett? Dr. Willard.

347
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,508
Brett! Brett!

348
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,172
Brett! Brett!

349
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,504
"Brett! Brett!"

350
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:36,840
Oh, Jesus, Brett, you idiot.

351
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:41,351
Mr. Wilson,
I'm quickly tiring of your nonsense.

352
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:45,190
Get up out of that damn chair.

353
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,437
It's not funny.

354
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:51,229
Perhaps you could use up some of
that energy setting up the work lights.

355
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:53,613
"Brett! Brett!"

356
00:27:53,784 --> 00:27:55,942
Grow up, Brett.

357
00:27:57,413 --> 00:28:00,034
"Brett! Brett!

358
00:28:00,207 --> 00:28:03,457
- You're on fire, Brett."
- Shut up!

359
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,384
He won't be laughing for long.

360
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:15,300
I never dreamt
I'd spend another night in that place.

361
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:20,802
But day turned to night pretty fast,
and where was I gonna go?

362
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,723
I was a dog on a leash,
with a cruel master.

363
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:36,867
One more left.

364
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:50,830
Fingers crossed, you piece of shit.

365
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:53,677
Never been afraid of the dark.

366
00:28:54,512 --> 00:28:57,181
I was always more afraid
of the light.

367
00:28:57,765 --> 00:29:00,682
I didn't wanna see
what was gonna happen.

368
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:05,727
If you can't see what's coming for you,
maybe it can't see you either.

369
00:29:09,026 --> 00:29:11,434
Oh, we have light.

370
00:29:11,612 --> 00:29:12,857
Here you go.

371
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:18,404
- Don't all thank me at once.
- Thank you.

372
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:20,369
Good work, Brett.

373
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:24,701
- Where's Dr. Willard?
- No idea. You want some of this?

374
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:27,541
Don't you think
we should wait for the doctor?

375
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:29,170
Why, is he the barman?

376
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:30,668
Do you want some of this?

377
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,871
I knew what was coming.

378
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:34,505
Needed to keep my wits about me,
stay sharp.

379
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:37,092
If he was smart, he'd do the same.

380
00:29:37,263 --> 00:29:40,513
Last thing you wanna be is liquored- up
when the shit comes down.

381
00:29:40,683 --> 00:29:42,058
And it would come down.

382
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:43,720
No?

383
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,552
Come on, man,
it's bloody freezing outside.

384
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:48,856
It doesn't mix with my medication.

385
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:56,488
Thank you for the light, Mr. Wilson.

386
00:29:56,657 --> 00:29:58,401
It's wonderful.

387
00:29:58,576 --> 00:30:00,569
Now we can see one another.

388
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:05,123
Say hello to fucking Gandalf.

389
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:07,367
Well, dinner's served.

390
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:09,413
Sorry it's not more exciting.

391
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:13,005
So, Willard, what have you
got planned for this evening?

392
00:30:13,174 --> 00:30:17,172
Bit of disco dancing?
Game of cards?

393
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:21,295
Actually, I was hoping that Dr. Willard
would tell us more about this place.

394
00:30:21,474 --> 00:30:24,760
Well, we are currently...

395
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,853
...in the kitchen area
of the Blackwater Institute.

396
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:30,596
Brett, you were supposed
to be filming this.

397
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:33,314
During the 1950s...

398
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:37,733
...this place was an institute
for mental health care...

399
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:38,938
...of a sort.

400
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:41,786
- An asylum?
- Yes, a private facility.

401
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:46,247
It was run by a revolutionary scientist
called Blackwater.

402
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:49,832
He was a great thinker,
an innovator.

403
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:52,328
He was taking the study
of the human mind...

404
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:55,921
...into whole new spheres
of research.

405
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:57,171
Sounds like a swell guy.

406
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:59,300
No, no, no, he was...

407
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,130
...for a time.

408
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:07,558
The details are a little sketchy, but it
would appear that at some time...

409
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:12,477
I would put it around 1958, 1959.

410
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,778
The scientific world, of which
he had become such a key part...

411
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:18,899
...turned on him.

412
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:24,657
I suppose he refused
to modernise his thinking...

413
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:27,949
...and so paid the price.

414
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,495
No longer taken seriously...

415
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:35,169
...Blackwater boarded himself
and his patients...

416
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,753
All of whom had significant
psychological problems.

417
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:42,710
Into the asylum.

418
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:50,184
None of his discoveries
were ever published...

419
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:53,137
...in respected journals.

420
00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:59,776
By the time the authorities
shut him down in 1963...

421
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:03,702
...he was a shadow of a man.

422
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:10,829
As tormented as the last
of his surviving patients.

423
00:32:11,418 --> 00:32:13,706
And what's that got to do with me?

424
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:18,170
Well, technically, not a thing.

425
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:21,708
The history of this place
is merely incidental.

426
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:24,960
What is significant...

427
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,840
...is that the beginnings
of your story started here.

428
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:32,851
Bringing you back to investigate
the reactions of your mind...

429
00:32:33,023 --> 00:32:39,524
...that is the defining aspect
of the research.

430
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:45,943
We will begin tomorrow.

431
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:50,195
We will ask you questions,
ask you to relive your experience.

432
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:51,784
I wasn't listening.

433
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:55,244
Just staring into the shadows,
wondering what they were hiding.

434
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:58,709
I had to get out of there.
I was suffocating.

435
00:32:59,132 --> 00:33:00,840
Excuse me.

436
00:33:08,225 --> 00:33:09,767
I'll go check if he's okay.

437
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:31,279
I did think about ending it.

438
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:34,956
I'll admit that, better for everybody.

439
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:37,119
Long-run, maybe it would've been.

440
00:33:37,296 --> 00:33:38,956
Me dead, they might've just left.

441
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:43,793
But I'm not a quitter.
It's something I just couldn't do.

442
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,484
There you are.

443
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,320
Are you all right?

444
00:34:10,913 --> 00:34:13,451
I shouldn't have come back
to this place.

445
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:18,121
I spent years trying to get past this.

446
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:22,007
This is dangerous, me being here.

447
00:34:22,466 --> 00:34:25,965
If you really want to leave,
I'm sure everyone will understand.

448
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:30,761
Maybe some more therapy
wouldn't be such a bad thing.

449
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,724
Back at the institute?

450
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:35,519
No.

451
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:38,143
Here, with Dr. Willard.

452
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:42,899
The things you think you saw...

453
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,027
...they seemed real.

454
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:46,857
Delusions always do.

455
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:51,535
Ghost stories are exactly that,
Nick...

456
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:53,531
...stories.

457
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,324
Your mind made them up
for some reason.

458
00:34:57,793 --> 00:35:01,209
That just makes the truth worse,
doesn't it?

459
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,378
When we start the study tomorrow,
the truth will come out.

460
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,169
Then you can put all of this
behind you.

461
00:35:08,345 --> 00:35:11,050
I killed a woman
and I can't remember doing it.

462
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,015
You don't get a lot of sympathy
when that kind of thing happens.

463
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:20,145
Your family and friends ostracize you.
They don't wanna know you anymore.

464
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:23,851
I spent every day at the institute trying
to piece together what happened.

465
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:26,234
And every day,
I came up with the same answer: -

466
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:28,232
That they think...

467
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:35,034
I'm there for the reason
they think I am. That I'm crazy.

468
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:41,080
I just can't find the answers.

469
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,418
It's just darkness.

470
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:59,056
- I've gotta go.
- No, don't.

471
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:02,103
Just stay one night.

472
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:04,276
I wanna show you something.

473
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:08,525
And if by tomorrow morning
you still have doubts...

474
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:10,822
...then leave
before anyone wakes up...

475
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:13,234
...and I won't say a word.

476
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:18,283
What do you mean?

477
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:21,618
I have an idea.

478
00:36:24,964 --> 00:36:26,209
Sorry, Willard.

479
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:28,422
Really, Mr. Wilson.

480
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:29,624
This is cosy.

481
00:36:30,178 --> 00:36:31,802
I tried my best.

482
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:36,592
- So where's your friend Nick?
- Gone for a walk, I'd imagine.

483
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:37,799
And where's Rachel?

484
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:40,053
Keeping him company,
I would think.

485
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:42,981
- Is that safe?
- Of course.

486
00:36:43,149 --> 00:36:45,605
I don't trust him.
- Me neither.

487
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:46,808
Gives me the creeps.

488
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:50,150
It's been a long day.

489
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:52,648
I think it's time I went to bed.

490
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:54,485
- I'll take you.
- Thank you, Melissa.

491
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:56,737
- Good night, Brett.
- Good night, Willard.

492
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,956
You see now,
you've been overdoing it.

493
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:03,834
Nonsense, my dear.

494
00:37:04,003 --> 00:37:05,913
I'm as fit as a fiddle.

495
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:07,666
As long as you let me know, okay?

496
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,999
Have you the list
of all my items I required?

497
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:12,465
- Yes.
- And they're all in my room?

498
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:14,673
Nick.

499
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:20,385
I'd like to talk to you in private
for a moment, if you don't mind.

500
00:37:22,147 --> 00:37:23,605
Where's Rachel?

501
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:25,305
She's asleep.

502
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,821
If you don't believe me,
go and check, she's still breathing.

503
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,484
I didn't say anything.

504
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:36,493
Dr. Willard, I'll just make
your room up the best I can.

505
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:38,036
Thank you.

506
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,957
There's something
I haven't told the others...

507
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:46,535
...but I think that you should know.

508
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:48,036
Will you come with me?

509
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:08,395
I have not been entirely honest
with the others.

510
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:13,983
My book, it is not about you.

511
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:17,571
It is more about what happened.

512
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,869
I recently came into possession
of Blackwater's private journal.

513
00:38:26,753 --> 00:38:33,254
The journal details much
of Blackwater's research practises.

514
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:37,586
And makes very disturbing reading.

515
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:42,300
Blackwater was experimenting
on his patients...

516
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:46,769
...inmates of his asylum,
in the most unorthodox of ways.

517
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:51,269
Medical practises
on the clinically insane...

518
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:54,896
...were not of a high standard
in the 1950s.

519
00:38:55,615 --> 00:39:00,443
But Blackwater took his research
to a whole new level of depravity...

520
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:02,779
...of cruelty.

521
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:08,453
Most of the work
was concentrated in the basement.

522
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:12,377
That is where the real horror
took place.

523
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:18,252
He was ostracized
from the scientific world at the time...

524
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:24,765
...because of his attempt to suggest
the existence of the human soul.

525
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:31,522
Why are you telling me this?

526
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:34,566
Because...

527
00:39:37,783 --> 00:39:42,160
That's not all the journal details.

528
00:39:43,205 --> 00:39:45,114
The purpose of those experiments...

529
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:51,410
...was connected to the contraption
that you say took Sammy.

530
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,167
No...

531
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:56,755
That thing didn't take Sammy.

532
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,216
I know that now. It was in my head.

533
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,925
- Rachel told me.
- Rachel?

534
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:06,925
Rachel's a student, Mr. West,
a good one...

535
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,063
...but no expert.

536
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:17,526
I am not as convinced of your guilt
as you appear to be.

537
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:19,528
Blackwater claimed...

538
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,365
...that the machine he was working on,
that thing upstairs...

539
00:40:23,996 --> 00:40:26,035
...was a portal to another realm.

540
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:31,201
A realm
which could separate the soul...

541
00:40:31,378 --> 00:40:33,122
...from the body.

542
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,044
And you believe that?

543
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:41,378
I believe it's possible.

544
00:40:45,392 --> 00:40:48,512
This place is filled with evil.

545
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:52,308
I feel it at every turn.

546
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,733
There is a chance
that whatever took Sammy...

547
00:40:55,903 --> 00:40:59,817
...still lurks in the darkest corners
of this asylum.

548
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:07,529
So you don't think I'm crazy?

549
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:09,541
No, Mr. West.

550
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,584
But right now, you and I...

551
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:17,830
...are the only two people in this world
who really believe that.

552
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,588
Doctor...

553
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:26,217
I don't know
how you think I can help you.

554
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:28,100
You know why?

555
00:41:28,269 --> 00:41:30,807
Because they were just delusions!

556
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,390
I don't think so.

557
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:38,606
When dealing with matters
of the mind, there is nothing certain.

558
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:41,615
What happened to you
four years ago...

559
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:44,273
...was just one in a series
of misadventures...

560
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:46,575
...that have taken place here
over the years.

561
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:49,071
They were all in my head!
I know that now!

562
00:41:49,248 --> 00:41:51,574
In my head!

563
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:55,377
They had to be.

564
00:41:56,172 --> 00:41:58,580
Did they, Mr. West?

565
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:05,169
I am interested
in the answers to a question...

566
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:08,633
...that no one in my profession
dares to ask.

567
00:42:09,644 --> 00:42:13,309
What if the crazy person
isn't crazy?

568
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:17,692
What if what they're saying is true?

569
00:42:18,611 --> 00:42:20,402
And now that we are here...

570
00:42:20,988 --> 00:42:26,493
...I am in a position
to do something about it.

571
00:42:26,953 --> 00:42:29,622
For years,
I've been told that I was crazy...

572
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:33,490
...that I made this whole thing up,
and now you're saying that it was true.

573
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:36,076
Yes, Mr. West.

574
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:41,838
You're crazier than me.

575
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:46,342
Everything is in place.

576
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:50,720
Brett and Rachel are my controls,
only they don't know it.

577
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:52,436
They are grounded in science.

578
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:56,851
They absolutely will not believe
in anything I have just told you.

579
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:03,608
They are an intrinsic part of this study,
even more than you.

580
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:10,701
So will you help me, Mr. West?

581
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:13,784
This is...

582
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:20,039
I don't know.

583
00:43:20,215 --> 00:43:24,711
Then think carefully
about what you want.

584
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:28,764
If the journal is accurate...

585
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:33,258
...men with a greater reason and will
than you...

586
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:36,848
...have lost their lives to this place.

587
00:43:56,251 --> 00:44:00,747
And just like that, everything you think
you know is turned upside down.

588
00:44:00,922 --> 00:44:03,592
And nobody is what they seem.

589
00:44:10,098 --> 00:44:12,423
They slept too easily.

590
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:14,974
They had no idea.

591
00:44:15,395 --> 00:44:18,064
So naive, so innocent.

592
00:44:19,399 --> 00:44:22,021
So fucking stupid.

593
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:32,112
Come on.

594
00:44:32,496 --> 00:44:34,405
And so it began.

595
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:39,160
A young girl with a plan
way out of her depth and sinking fast.

596
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,797
Come on.

597
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:51,968
This is foolish.

598
00:44:53,266 --> 00:44:56,849
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Nick, it's gonna be fine.

599
00:44:57,187 --> 00:44:59,678
Please, Rachel, don't do this.

600
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:05,110
- It's not safe here.
- It's perfectly safe.

601
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:07,485
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

602
00:45:10,158 --> 00:45:11,190
Please don't, Rachel.

603
00:45:11,368 --> 00:45:13,526
Nick, I'm gonna go
and sit down on that chair...

604
00:45:13,704 --> 00:45:16,788
...and you'll see
that everything is gonna be fine.

605
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:20,492
- Don't!
- Nick, it's gonna be all right.

606
00:45:20,961 --> 00:45:22,159
But Willard...

607
00:45:22,337 --> 00:45:24,164
What about Dr. Willard?

608
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:25,964
He told me...

609
00:45:27,009 --> 00:45:29,334
I wanna believe you, but...

610
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:31,420
Nick, look at this thing.

611
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:32,759
It's nothing.

612
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:35,173
Brett sat in it earlier,
and he's all right.

613
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,268
Well, he's a bit of an asshole,
but he's always been like that.

614
00:45:40,022 --> 00:45:42,264
Don't sit in that thing, Rachel.

615
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:48,856
She should've listened to me.

616
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:51,154
They should all
have listened to me.

617
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:54,195
But they're too carried away,
you see, with their own ideas...

618
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:58,699
... Wrapped up in educated egos
that don't know what I know.

619
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,955
See?
There's nothing to be worried about.

620
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,539
Famous last words.

621
00:46:05,047 --> 00:46:08,297
It's a chair, nothing more.

622
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:10,341
What are you so afraid of?

623
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:13,544
You haven't seen the things
I've seen.

624
00:46:14,223 --> 00:46:16,050
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

625
00:46:16,433 --> 00:46:19,055
What is it
that you don't understand?

626
00:46:19,728 --> 00:46:21,555
Can't you see, Nick?

627
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,889
It's all in your mind.

628
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,358
No!

629
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:37,738
Rachel!

630
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,081
No!

631
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,876
- Oh, Rachel.
- Fuck.

632
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:49,080
- Hang on.
- Help me!

633
00:46:49,258 --> 00:46:50,918
- Willard!
- Get it off me!

634
00:46:51,093 --> 00:46:52,671
Willard!

635
00:46:52,845 --> 00:46:54,588
I fucking warned you!

636
00:46:55,139 --> 00:46:57,262
I fucking warned you!
- Nick!

637
00:46:59,727 --> 00:47:01,684
God! God!

638
00:47:06,025 --> 00:47:07,768
I told you.

639
00:47:09,111 --> 00:47:13,061
I warned you. Didn't I say to you?

640
00:47:14,116 --> 00:47:15,776
Willard!

641
00:47:22,792 --> 00:47:24,120
Willard!

642
00:47:25,294 --> 00:47:27,121
Willard!

643
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:30,130
Willard!

644
00:47:32,802 --> 00:47:34,426
Willard!

645
00:47:35,763 --> 00:47:40,259
Gone, just like that.
Just like Sammy.

646
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:49,399
- Dr. Willard.
- What is it? What's happening?

647
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:50,731
It's happened again.

648
00:47:50,903 --> 00:47:53,145
Rachel, she's gone through.
It's taken her.

649
00:48:06,544 --> 00:48:08,252
Nick.

650
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:27,064
Nick?

651
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:31,233
Nick?

652
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:39,817
Rachel. Rachel, help me.

653
00:48:39,994 --> 00:48:41,619
Rachel.

654
00:48:41,788 --> 00:48:43,780
Rachel, help me.

655
00:48:49,712 --> 00:48:51,954
Rachel, help me.

656
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:53,330
Help me.

657
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:54,670
Nick!

658
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:56,301
Rachel!

659
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:58,094
Rachel.

660
00:48:58,263 --> 00:49:00,718
Rachel.

661
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:13,645
Nick.

662
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,940
Nick!

663
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:21,574
It'll hardly come as a surprise
that I got the blame like last time.

664
00:49:23,204 --> 00:49:25,244
You can kind of see why.

665
00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:29,365
So you think she got sucked
into the machine, just like Sammy.

666
00:49:29,753 --> 00:49:30,951
Wait a minute, timeout.

667
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:33,620
I don't know, maybe.

668
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:36,420
She was trying to help me.
I could hear the voices.

669
00:49:36,593 --> 00:49:38,965
Willard, have you been
handing out crack pipes?

670
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:42,257
You have a better explanation
for what happened, I suppose?

671
00:49:42,432 --> 00:49:45,386
Well, I'd say
it's the insane-asylum inmate.

672
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,102
Yeah, in the torture chamber...

673
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,307
...with whatever murder weapon
he used to kill the last girl.

674
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:51,644
You think I did it?

675
00:49:51,816 --> 00:49:54,224
Well, it's not like you're a nutter
or anything.

676
00:49:54,402 --> 00:49:56,229
Show some respect for the patient.

677
00:49:56,863 --> 00:50:00,398
Can't you see you're upsetting him
with these baseless accusations?

678
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:03,113
- Baseless bollocks.
- That's enough.

679
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:06,492
Nick.

680
00:50:11,128 --> 00:50:12,586
- Rachel.
- Nick.

681
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,956
Rachel, help me.

682
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,085
- Nick?
- Rachel, help me.

683
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:23,295
Help me, Rachel.

684
00:50:25,142 --> 00:50:27,467
Rachel, help me.

685
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,939
- Nick?
- Help me.

686
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:32,766
- Rachel.
- Nick?

687
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,903
Rachel, help. Rachel.

688
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:41,698
- Nick.
- Rachel.

689
00:50:41,867 --> 00:50:44,155
- Rachel.
- Nick.

690
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:49,821
Rachel. Rachel.

691
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,125
Rachel.

692
00:50:53,879 --> 00:50:56,500
- Help me.
- Nick.

693
00:50:56,673 --> 00:50:58,630
Rachel.

694
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:03,510
- Nick.
- Rachel.

695
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:11,938
Nick?

696
00:51:34,545 --> 00:51:37,000
Rachel. Rachel.

697
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:45,052
I'm going through.
I have to bring her back.

698
00:51:45,222 --> 00:51:47,049
Yeah,
that's what we've been saying.

699
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:49,300
Yeah, bring her back,
everything will be fine.

700
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:53,308
This is the last time
I'm going to tell you two to be silent.

701
00:51:55,357 --> 00:52:01,859
There are things happening here
you can't possibly comprehend.

702
00:52:03,991 --> 00:52:05,236
Nick.

703
00:52:05,743 --> 00:52:08,364
Supposing you do go through...

704
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,487
...there's no guarantee
you'll come back.

705
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:16,244
We don't know
what's waiting for you over there.

706
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:20,085
You shouldn't speak ill of people,
but what a fucking coward.

707
00:52:20,257 --> 00:52:22,084
Room full of try-hards
and big shots...

708
00:52:22,259 --> 00:52:24,252
... And nobody wants
to take responsibility.

709
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:27,421
Time for good old
Nick West to step up, eh?

710
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:31,557
Whatever it is,
Rachel's mixed up in it right now.

711
00:52:31,727 --> 00:52:34,183
- I'm going through.
- No!

712
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:36,682
Stop.

713
00:52:37,399 --> 00:52:38,942
Wait.

714
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:42,110
You'll be no good to Rachel
if you can't come back.

715
00:52:44,782 --> 00:52:46,276
What are we gonna do, then?

716
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:49,527
Blackwater's journal.

717
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:52,907
There must be something in there.
He built this thing.

718
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,537
He knows better
than anyone how to work it.

719
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,454
Where is the journal?

720
00:52:57,628 --> 00:52:59,537
It's in my room.

721
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,172
Come on.

722
00:53:02,216 --> 00:53:04,789
All right,
we'll do it your way, old man.

723
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:07,127
But we don't have much time.

724
00:53:12,935 --> 00:53:15,806
Twenty quid says
the old man goes missing next.

725
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,604
You think it's Nick?

726
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:20,644
Of course it is.
It's fucking obvious. He's a psycho.

727
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:22,396
Dr. Willard doesn't think so.

728
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,820
Yeah, well,
Dr. Willard's as full of shit as Nick is.

729
00:53:27,825 --> 00:53:30,150
Brett, I'm scared.

730
00:53:31,495 --> 00:53:32,610
Don't be scared.

731
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:37,120
What was that?

732
00:53:38,336 --> 00:53:40,743
Fuck all, who cares?

733
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:44,835
Wait a minute.
I think it came from the chair.

734
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,594
God, not you as well.
It's a chair for chrissake.

735
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,588
I sat on that thing earlier
and nothing happened.

736
00:53:51,766 --> 00:53:55,633
It's bullshit.
The whole thing is bullshit.

737
00:53:57,105 --> 00:53:59,809
- You sat in it?
- Yeah.

738
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,022
Show me.

739
00:54:04,654 --> 00:54:05,685
What?

740
00:54:06,197 --> 00:54:07,857
Show me.

741
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:10,105
Please.

742
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:15,699
Right, but we carry on
from where we left off.

743
00:54:15,873 --> 00:54:18,199
I've got a right horn on.

744
00:54:22,672 --> 00:54:25,542
See? Nothing.

745
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,218
- Brett.
- Yeah.

746
00:54:29,387 --> 00:54:32,803
- What do you think that's for?
- I don't know.

747
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:44,811
What...

748
00:54:53,453 --> 00:54:54,912
Is there anything yet?

749
00:54:58,082 --> 00:54:59,577
We don't have time for this.

750
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:02,040
I'm going as fast as I can.

751
00:55:02,212 --> 00:55:04,703
Portions of the text are damaged.

752
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:06,589
You can't build
a machine like that...

753
00:55:06,758 --> 00:55:08,750
...and not have some kind
of get-out clause.

754
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:11,881
For Rachel's sake, let's hope not.

755
00:55:18,436 --> 00:55:20,014
Fuck.

756
00:55:30,782 --> 00:55:32,442
Rachel?

757
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:42,285
Rachel?

758
00:55:45,922 --> 00:55:47,416
Rachel?

759
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,102
Hello.

760
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:01,593
Hello?

761
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:04,607
Hello, sailor.

762
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,084
Horse.

763
00:56:36,515 --> 00:56:38,175
Come on.

764
00:56:44,773 --> 00:56:47,311
- What the hell is going on?
- Shut up, Brett.

765
00:56:49,611 --> 00:56:51,936
There is something in here with us.

766
00:56:52,614 --> 00:56:53,777
What, in the closet?

767
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:56,107
No, you idiot, in this place.

768
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:02,863
It's some kind of a...

769
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:05,537
I don't know.

770
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:07,795
But I think it's after me.

771
00:57:08,213 --> 00:57:09,707
Well, then, we should split up.

772
00:57:10,215 --> 00:57:13,584
I have a feeling
it's probably after you too.

773
00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:18,382
Nick was right.

774
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:20,047
Yeah.

775
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:22,135
Where's Dr. Willard
when you need him?

776
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:24,937
Come on, old man.

777
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:27,810
Do you want me to help you or not?

778
00:57:27,983 --> 00:57:30,189
Dr. Willard. It's taken Brett.

779
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,068
- That thing, it's taken him.
- What?

780
00:57:32,237 --> 00:57:35,856
He sat in the chair.
He wanted to show me it was safe.

781
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:37,575
I know.

782
00:57:37,951 --> 00:57:39,232
He disappeared.

783
00:57:40,746 --> 00:57:43,913
I didn't believe you, but you were right.
This is crazy.

784
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,826
That fool.

785
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:50,628
I told him to show more respect
for things he does not understand!

786
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:52,671
Enough of this fucking melodrama.

787
00:57:59,014 --> 00:58:00,093
What are we gonna do?

788
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:03,101
I don't know,
but we're wasting time here.

789
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:04,932
I'm going through.

790
00:58:05,104 --> 00:58:06,931
Nick.

791
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:08,346
I'm going through.

792
00:58:08,524 --> 00:58:10,018
Nick!

793
00:58:10,192 --> 00:58:11,355
Nick.

794
00:58:11,777 --> 00:58:16,404
This is madness! It's suicide!

795
00:58:18,409 --> 00:58:20,318
I don't have a choice.

796
00:58:20,494 --> 00:58:21,609
I let Sammy down.

797
00:58:22,329 --> 00:58:23,907
I should've gone after her.

798
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:26,907
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake twice.

799
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,251
Dear boy...

800
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,748
...if you go through...

801
00:58:31,714 --> 00:58:35,213
...there's every chance
you'll never come back.

802
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:36,843
Come back to what?

803
00:58:37,011 --> 00:58:40,214
This? The institute?

804
00:58:40,973 --> 00:58:43,808
Everything I ever cared about
is through there.

805
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:47,644
Then there's nothing more
I can say.

806
00:58:50,232 --> 00:58:52,902
You take care of yourself, professor.

807
00:58:59,283 --> 00:59:01,490
It's been educational.

808
00:59:08,668 --> 00:59:10,376
No.

809
00:59:25,977 --> 00:59:28,468
Well, my dear.

810
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:35,605
That was easier
than we anticipated, eh?

811
00:59:35,778 --> 00:59:38,020
The fools.

812
00:59:38,197 --> 00:59:40,819
Never saw that coming, eh?

813
00:59:56,174 --> 01:00:01,215
- Rachel?
- Rachel. Rachel.

814
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:05,797
Rachel?

815
01:00:06,726 --> 01:00:08,683
Rachel?

816
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,559
Rachel!

817
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:26,571
There's a door, come on.

818
01:00:32,502 --> 01:00:34,079
See if you can open it. Hurry up.

819
01:00:36,422 --> 01:00:38,913
- Jeez, I can't, it's locked.
- What?

820
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:40,586
I can't, I'm trying.

821
01:00:42,095 --> 01:00:44,965
Rachel, there could be anything
behind this door.

822
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:48,183
Brett, don't be ridiculous.
We need to get out of this place.

823
01:00:48,351 --> 01:00:51,767
- Just open the fucking door.
- All right.

824
01:00:53,606 --> 01:00:56,726
- Shit, I've cut my hand.
- Oh, God.

825
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:14,083
Brett, put some pressure on it.

826
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:15,627
I can't. Look.

827
01:01:15,795 --> 01:01:18,121
Look how deep it is.

828
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:20,542
Put some pressure on it.

829
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:42,235
Run, Rachel, run.

830
01:01:57,963 --> 01:01:59,671
Rachel? Rachel!

831
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:39,210
Brett.

832
01:02:41,673 --> 01:02:43,215
Brett.

833
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:46,130
- Who's there?
- It's Nick.

834
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,509
What, the psycho killer?

835
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:51,223
Fucking idiot.

836
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,013
He'd seen the demon,
he still wanted to blame me.

837
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:57,685
Some people just get
what's fucking coming to them.

838
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,025
Why did you do that?

839
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:04,352
- Where's Rachel?
- Who?

840
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,561
Where's Rachel?

841
01:03:07,324 --> 01:03:08,699
She went that way.

842
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:14,404
Or it may have been that way,
you cunt.

843
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,412
So that book's supposed
to keep you safe?

844
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:25,755
That's the idea.

845
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:29,254
Let's have a look.

846
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:35,761
How much blood
does this demon need?

847
01:03:39,773 --> 01:03:41,398
A lot.

848
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,942
- Dr. Willard.
- Sorry.

849
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:52,827
The demon must be satisfied.

850
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:09,127
- It's me. Are you okay?
- Nick, Nick.

851
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,928
Are you okay?

852
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,469
- It killed Brett. It killed Brett.
- What killed Brett?

853
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,302
What killed Brett?

854
01:04:16,977 --> 01:04:19,433
Please save me, please.

855
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,481
Please.

856
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:25,734
I'm gonna get you out of this place.
I promise you.

857
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,168
Okay, you ready?

858
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:49,836
Come on.

859
01:04:50,886 --> 01:04:53,638
Wait, it's coming.

860
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,475
And finally, we come face to face.

861
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:04,941
Me and my demon, head-to-head.

862
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,143
Toe- to-toe.

863
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,526
- Can you see it?
- I don't think so.

864
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,206
- It's the blood it wants.
- We have to go.

865
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,666
It's the blood. It's the blood it wants.

866
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,090
Told you I'd get her
out of that outfit.

867
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,716
If only I could get her tits out now.

868
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,386
Shit.

869
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,567
Come on.

870
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,902
Close your eyes.

871
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,850
Please.

872
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,102
You've done us both so proud.

873
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,938
So proud.

874
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:48,772
Where is it? Where is it?

875
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,691
It's gone.

876
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:19,296
Oh, God!

877
01:08:28,397 --> 01:08:31,398
Stop toying with her.

878
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,901
Who...

879
01:09:25,454 --> 01:09:27,114
Willard.

880
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:40,175
Dr. Willard.

881
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:44,054
There you are.

882
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:45,254
Bitch!

883
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:48,006
Strewth,
turn the v olume down, Granddad.

884
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,560
What a rotter.

885
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:52,219
As you can see,
it all got a bit silly at this point.

886
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:53,773
Girl with her puppies out.

887
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:56,728
- Demon, old banana in pyjamas.
- What are you doing?

888
01:09:56,902 --> 01:10:00,770
Is this what I promised you?
Are we prick-teasing you enough?

889
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:01,979
Are you full up?

890
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:06,910
Is this what you came here to see,
O my brothers?

891
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:09,451
My gift to you.

892
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:13,493
Look at this poorly written,
badly acted bullshit.

893
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:17,006
Is there any truth
in these B- movie banality?

894
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:19,463
- No, no.
- Help me.

895
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,959
There is no truth, my friends.

896
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:25,053
Believe no one, believe nothing.

897
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,882
I tell you what, party people...

898
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:31,351
... You geeks and freaks,
you bloodthirsty morons, fuck you.

899
01:10:31,854 --> 01:10:34,143
Bring on the red parade.

900
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:38,485
Get off me, old man.

901
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:42,353
I am not so old in this place.
- Help me!

902
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,365
Or weak.

903
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:49,287
So are there any pulses
in the house?

904
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:54,117
You deadbeat, midnight freak,
geek- witted torture- porn gore whores.

905
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:56,784
I know what you're looking for.
So have it, take it.

906
01:10:56,963 --> 01:10:59,501
Fair thee well,
and fuck you very much!

907
01:10:59,674 --> 01:11:01,880
Do you ever get the feeling
you've been cheated?

908
01:11:02,385 --> 01:11:03,665
But it's killing her!

909
01:11:03,844 --> 01:11:06,382
Small price to pay.

910
01:11:06,556 --> 01:11:10,684
She'll find her peace very soon.

911
01:11:12,603 --> 01:11:14,228
You set us up.

912
01:11:14,397 --> 01:11:20,517
You played directly into my hands
from the very start.

913
01:11:20,695 --> 01:11:25,404
Just as I knew you would.

914
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:29,072
Call it off her. Call it off her!

915
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:32,823
She does not answer to me.

916
01:11:32,999 --> 01:11:34,410
Nick.

917
01:11:39,714 --> 01:11:40,745
No.

918
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:44,923
But it answers to me.

919
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:56,890
Oh, Nick, please.

920
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:59,896
None of this is real.

921
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:10,948
I am demon.

922
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:13,951
None of this is real.

923
01:12:18,127 --> 01:12:22,457
Rachel, get away from him.

924
01:12:23,132 --> 01:12:25,968
Nick, please, listen to me.

925
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:28,377
This is not real.

926
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:31,797
Finish him, Nick.

927
01:12:34,769 --> 01:12:37,225
All in good time, baby.

928
01:12:38,356 --> 01:12:40,313
I love you.

929
01:12:49,617 --> 01:12:53,152
Get off her now!

930
01:12:53,329 --> 01:12:55,737
Please.

931
01:13:06,426 --> 01:13:09,343
Oh, my God, no!

932
01:13:11,014 --> 01:13:13,719
Oh, my God, no!

933
01:13:13,892 --> 01:13:16,727
Nick, no, Nick!

934
01:13:16,895 --> 01:13:18,306
No.

935
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,188
Nick, no!

936
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:23,983
I love you.
- No!

937
01:13:24,152 --> 01:13:25,860
I love you.

938
01:13:34,371 --> 01:13:35,450
No!

939
01:13:35,622 --> 01:13:38,457
Run, Rachel, run!

940
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:40,867
Oh, God, run!

941
01:13:41,044 --> 01:13:43,202
Run!

942
01:13:53,974 --> 01:13:56,679
- Oh, no.
- No!

943
01:13:56,852 --> 01:14:00,849
Oh, God, no!

944
01:14:01,022 --> 01:14:02,814
Nick!

945
01:14:04,735 --> 01:14:07,735
No, no, no.

946
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,323
Nick!

947
01:14:21,501 --> 01:14:22,830
My God!

948
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:26,585
No. Nick, Nick!

949
01:14:27,466 --> 01:14:28,876
No!

950
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:31,008
Nick, Nick!

951
01:14:33,931 --> 01:14:35,425
Oh, God.

952
01:14:46,276 --> 01:14:47,854
No!

953
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:12,935
No!

954
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,132
No!

955
01:15:53,928 --> 01:15:55,671
You're a cunt.

956
01:15:55,846 --> 01:16:00,638
You're just a low-rent cunt!

957
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:04,182
You're a cunt!

958
01:16:15,157 --> 01:16:17,364
Hey, hey, hey.

959
01:16:18,369 --> 01:16:21,121
There's no use
begging or screaming.

960
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:26,784
Because you're a whore.

961
01:16:32,258 --> 01:16:34,749
- Open your legs.
- No.

962
01:16:35,886 --> 01:16:38,009
- Open your legs.
- No.

963
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:42,059
Open your fucking legs!

964
01:17:02,455 --> 01:17:07,698
You're a worthless,
cheap-perfume-smelling cunt.

965
01:17:07,877 --> 01:17:09,834
And you're weak.

966
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:13,251
And as my mother used to say...

967
01:17:13,424 --> 01:17:17,588
...the weak are always trying
to subvert the strong.

968
01:17:22,934 --> 01:17:25,425
And I am the strong.

969
01:17:42,203 --> 01:17:44,243
So buckle up, bitch.

970
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,115
Here comes the pain.

971
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:36,833
Rachel!

972
01:18:37,258 --> 01:18:39,963
Rachel.

973
01:18:40,887 --> 01:18:43,460
Where are you?

974
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:49,518
Rachel!

975
01:19:16,339 --> 01:19:19,293
No, no.

976
01:19:25,181 --> 01:19:28,385
See, Nick? There is no chair.

977
01:19:29,019 --> 01:19:30,892
No chair?

978
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,813
It's okay.

979
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:47,153
- What? What's funny?
- You're a genius, shrinky.

980
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:49,736
You're a fucking goddamn genius.

981
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:52,406
- What?
- Of course there's no chair.

982
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:57,082
There never was a fucking chair.

983
01:19:57,255 --> 01:19:59,082
No chair.

984
01:19:59,257 --> 01:20:01,250
No chair, shrinky.

985
01:20:01,968 --> 01:20:03,760
No.

986
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:14,385
Rachel!

987
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:46,379
Rachel.

988
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:51,301
Rachel.

989
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:54,976
Rachel, where are you?

990
01:21:01,195 --> 01:21:02,819
Sammy?

991
01:21:04,782 --> 01:21:06,573
Sammy?

992
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:09,816
Sammy!

993
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:55,247
I'm sorry.

994
01:21:55,624 --> 01:21:57,498
I'm sorry I did this.

995
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:00,870
They're all dead now.

996
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:04,998
It's just me and you, Sammy.

997
01:22:05,718 --> 01:22:06,963
It's me.

998
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:08,879
Never seen you look so beautiful.

999
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:10,597
Look at me.

1000
01:22:10,765 --> 01:22:12,389
It's Rachel.

1001
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:14,017
You look so beautiful.

1002
01:22:14,185 --> 01:22:16,343
Nick, it's Ra... This is Rachel.

1003
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,979
It's just me and you now, Sam.

1004
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:19,771
I'm not...

1005
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:55,430
It's okay, Rachel.

1006
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,728
It's okay.

1007
01:23:25,882 --> 01:23:27,459
It's okay.

1008
01:23:32,305 --> 01:23:34,132
Please, don't.

1009
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:35,880
It's okay.

1010
01:23:38,978 --> 01:23:41,765
No, please.

1011
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:44,062
Oh, Nick.

1012
01:23:47,487 --> 01:23:51,816
Please, please don't! No!

1013
01:23:51,991 --> 01:23:54,743
No, no, no!

1014
01:25:24,876 --> 01:25:27,083
Well, that was a bit of fun, wasn't it?

1015
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,509
Hey, you're not gonna tell anyone
about this, are you?

1016
01:25:32,801 --> 01:25:35,718
Trust me.
No one's gonna believe us.

1017
01:25:41,268 --> 01:25:45,052
Are you sure you wanna go on the run
with a crazy person?

1018
01:25:51,445 --> 01:25:53,817
I love you.

1019
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:10,286
Well, let's go get crazy.
