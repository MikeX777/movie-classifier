1
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,597
Hey, Krzys!

2
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,098
Let have a drink.

3
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:16,334
Have a drink and then
fucking dance with our friends.

4
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,569
Wonderful Idea.

5
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,106
No looking around yet.
You don't have to look around.

6
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,908
Hey, wait, don't
look around here, okay?

7
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,678
We're gonna focus on each other.

8
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,113
Tell you what...

9
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,982
You look like that
guy, you gotta...

10
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:33,485
You need to have
them look at you.

11
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,522
Don't look at them, everyone's
looking at them already.

12
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:38,990
But they like it.

13
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,059
Before, I just think
we need like a little...

14
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,661
a little preface on...

15
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:44,696
Just like, um...

16
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,432
I have a lot of friends,
and I was like,

17
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:51,236
just gotten into, Out of
relationships you really don't
know what to do.

18
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,772
Let's say you don't know what
to do, you mean, you know
exactly what to do.

19
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,776
But it's a bit of like, uh...

20
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:00,044
Put it this way...

21
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,113
My number one rule...

22
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,249
with women,

23
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,251
is imagine every woman,
when you walk in the room,

24
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,620
every girl has
a boyfriend already.

25
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,088
There's nothing more
that a woman likes than

26
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:12,692
somebody with
fucking confidence, man.

27
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,693
Forget it.

28
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,765
Just practice now,
we're just practicing.

29
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,302
Just close your eyes,
it's even better that way.

30
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:31,344
There you go.

31
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,146
You need more of this.

32
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,916
Move it like this.

33
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,918
Just bring it up.

34
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,390
Time is running out.

35
00:18:55,032 --> 00:18:56,535
Stop thinking so much.

36
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:00,939
I have to! I have to!

37
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,342
Stop thinking so much.

38
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:29,424
-How are you?
-No.

39
01:05:29,424 --> 01:05:30,726
Who are you?

40
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:31,927
Here?

41
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:34,730
Your make up, and your dress.

42
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,965
Yeah?

43
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:39,602
You are someone...
I mean,

44
01:05:40,602 --> 01:05:42,504
some character from the movie,

45
01:05:42,504 --> 01:05:45,374
or just like...
your imagination?

46
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:48,877
Uh-huh. I check, a little bit.

47
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,920
I don't know exactly...

48
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:08,130
Always.

49
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:12,247
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

50
01:16:40,728 --> 01:16:41,769
Okay?

51
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:27,112
No need. No need. No problem.

52
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:46,814
No, I have to go.

53
01:19:46,814 --> 01:19:48,816
I'd like to say bye to my
friend, okay?

54
01:19:48,816 --> 01:19:49,029
Okay.

55
01:20:03,029 --> 01:20:04,067
See you tomorrow.

56
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,643
-Bye.
-Bye.

57
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:49,263
Oh, wow.

58
01:26:12,566 --> 01:26:13,906
No.

59
01:26:18,906 --> 01:26:19,769
No.

60
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:24,224
It's like a boxing match,
take a break.

61
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,660
Have some water,
and go back in.

62
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:27,756
-Next time, next time.
-Okay!
