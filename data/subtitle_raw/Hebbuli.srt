1
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:17,767
"Hebbuli!" (Ferocious Tiger)

2
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:21,365
"Hebbuli!"

3
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:27,981
[English rap song]

4
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:41,233
[English rap song]

5
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,927
"Hebbuli!"

6
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,307
Sir, we're ready for
the surgical strike.

7
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,356
And our target is Hafiz.

8
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,418
Sir, Hafiz is the
Muslim commander.

9
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,608
And he has killed 65 of our
soldiers since the last four years.

10
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:23,842
Hafiz is in Kotli, PoK.

11
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:26,741
He has kidnapped 4 doctors
of our relief camp.

12
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:29,799
According to the sources, he was
injured by last night's cross-firing.

13
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,292
Four commandos from Team A under Captain
Ram, are on this mission currently.

14
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:38,691
These are one of the best, Sir.

15
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,937
Captain Ram one of the bravest
commandos of our country.

16
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:45,407
Keep going.

17
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,178
- Thank you, Sir. Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind.

18
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:48,745
Mission Blackboard is on.

19
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,182
Mission: freedom.

20
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:50,217
The objective of this mission
is to save the civilians of..

21
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:52,054
..our country from
the terrorists.

22
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:56,373
Team of highly trained Para
commandos led by Captain Ram.

23
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:58,098
This is the real battleground..

24
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:01,757
where there's only one thing
that determines life or death..

25
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,239
one bullet.

26
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:07,866
Our commandos have to infiltrate
the enemy's area stealthily..

27
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:09,765
and shoot them at point blank.

28
00:06:10,234 --> 00:06:11,939
There is threat to life.

29
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:17,349
Soldiers, we have to advance towards
the enemy camp cautiously..

30
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:18,622
and save our people.

31
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:19,862
- Okay, Sir.
- Be alert.

32
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:21,230
There!

33
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,716
Sir, we have shot two
terrorists down.

34
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,224
And, Sir..

35
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,495
News is that we have
completely secured the area.

36
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,711
We have found a huge amount of
bombs, grenades and weapons.

37
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:12,261
Over and out, Sir.

38
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,572
Soldiers, I've found the entry.

39
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,896
- I'm going in.
- Sir, may I come too?

40
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:51,902
You stay there,
I'll go and check.

41
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:54,171
Be alert. Wait for my signal.

42
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:56,891
Indian army!

43
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,403
Don't worry, it'll
be alright, okay?

44
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:00,759
Okay, quiet.

45
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:04,094
Where?

46
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,388
I'll be back.

47
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,519
For the first time, to kill
the Indian commandos..

48
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,353
They have come so close to us.

49
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:36,059
Such a big risk for
such a small income?

50
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,087
You all will die! All of you!
This is our land!

51
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,543
And we are even ready
to die for it.

52
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:47,937
Even if I die, there are thousands
like me who will fight..

53
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,133
..for the freedom of this land!

54
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:02,172
You will die first.

55
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,458
I'll send others after you.

56
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,566
Wait.

57
00:14:00,462 --> 00:14:01,424
Jai Hind, Sir.

58
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:02,219
Jai Hind.

59
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,037
You could've brought that
terrorist here, alive.

60
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,364
Why did you kill him?

61
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:11,657
I want an explanation.

62
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:14,557
We could've got so much
information from him!

63
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:18,093
Sir, we collected
the entire data.

64
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,855
And he didn't have any
more information.

65
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:22,907
Who are you to decide that?

66
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,750
Sir, this was our only option..

67
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,167
through which we
sent the message.

68
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:28,323
What message?

69
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:32,799
Sir, if they can invade
our land and attack us..

70
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:35,975
even we're not any lesser.

71
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:39,465
We're calm, that doesn't
mean we're weak.

72
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:43,119
We can invade and
destroy them as well.

73
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:47,102
What do you mean? Won't they attack
again for doing what you did?

74
00:14:47,182 --> 00:14:50,274
They will if they are
not scared, Sir.

75
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,101
This is the message I sent.

76
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,661
They will think a hundred
times before attacking us.

77
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,599
This is not the answer
to my question.

78
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,382
And remember, this will
not stop your enquiry.

79
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:04,464
And if that happens,
you will regret it.

80
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:12,287
I'm a soldier born in India, grew
up drinking River Ganga's water.

81
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:16,206
I will not hesitate to give
up my life for my country.

82
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:20,499
As far as enquiry is concerned, no
enquiry is bigger than my courage.

83
00:15:21,845 --> 00:15:22,852
What?

84
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:26,377
I'm ready for the enquiry, Sir.

85
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:37,350
His looks, his daring..

86
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,882
I fell for him at first sight!

87
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:43,389
His height, his personality..

88
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:46,136
He was just handsome soldier!

89
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:49,260
Wait a minute, you're talking
about a soldier, right?

90
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,421
Yes.

91
00:15:51,265 --> 00:15:53,276
Captain Ram.

92
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:57,750
- What are you saying?
- I think she likes you.

93
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,858
Who?

94
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,963
Who else? The doctor.

95
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,043
Shut up.

96
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:04,928
She might have seen guns
and bazooka only in films.

97
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:06,450
She saw everything.

98
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,803
Really?

99
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,619
What can I say? I'm
crazy about him!

100
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,934
I fell madly in love with him!

101
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,307
- You hide so many things!
- Hey!

102
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:17,601
Stop it already.

103
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:20,022
- He got a wicket in his first ball.
- Leave it!

104
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,379
I love him.

105
00:16:22,121 --> 00:16:24,484
But I have no idea
what to do ahead.

106
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:25,778
Go talk to her.

107
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:29,424
It's not that easy. I'll have to
find out what's in his heart.

108
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:33,603
- But when did I say that I love her?
- What's the need to tell?

109
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:38,925
Okay. I'll propose him
tomorrow in the morning.

110
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:46,190
Dr. Nandini, you look pinker
than this rose today.

111
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,055
I wanted to tell you
something since many days.

112
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,034
I love you.

113
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:56,576
Excellent! Your pair looks
like rose and it's thorns!

114
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:00,866
Dr. Harish, Nandini
is calling you.

115
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,390
- I'm coming!
- All the best!

116
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,475
Thank you! Nandini!

117
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:07,620
Doctor Harish, he
has high fever..

118
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,077
- ..but I gave him back pain's medicine.
- Don't worry.

119
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,736
I've got the syringe.

120
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:15,377
He'll be normal in
just two hours.

121
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,406
Harish!

122
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,200
You're a genius.

123
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,229
Thank you so much, Nandini! I
will inject such syringe always!

124
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:29,482
Are you crazy?

125
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,224
Am I sick that you're
giving me injection?

126
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:35,455
I've cured Nandini's
patient with an injection.

127
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:38,537
Have you seen your face? You
two have no connection.

128
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:42,805
Oh, shut up. We are
meant to be couples.

129
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,653
Nandini is a doctor.

130
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,825
So, am I a plumber? I can even
treat sick cats and dogs.

131
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,070
First do your own treatment!

132
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,532
- "Gave my heart, gave pain.."
- Hello!

133
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,510
- She speaks English fluently.
- I can speak Kannada fluently!

134
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,479
Listen up.

135
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:56,401
What?

136
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:58,105
I will propose her like this..

137
00:17:58,276 --> 00:18:01,901
"Listen to my heartbeat, I
chose you, you choose me too."

138
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,483
And she will choose me!

139
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:13,649
- Hi.
- Hi.

140
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:16,145
I can see a black pigeon
dancing on that mountain peak.

141
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,637
- Look there, Boss!
- You wanted to tell me something?

142
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,967
- Yeah, actually..
- Jai Hind, Sir.

143
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:21,805
Jai Hind.

144
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,315
- Actually..
- Jai Hind!

145
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:28,469
Jai Hind.

146
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,627
- Actually..
- Sir.

147
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:35,107
Okay, one second.

148
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:39,649
Sorry.

149
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,078
Actually, can I take
a selfie with you?

150
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:48,145
Why so?

151
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,137
You saved my life.

152
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:53,195
So I will tell people
that you saved my life.

153
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,004
Instead of my name, if you say Indian
Army helped you, then I'll help you.

154
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,262
I will be happy

155
00:18:58,318 --> 00:19:00,896
I think he is now
your competition.

156
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:03,927
Are you on his side?
How can you say this?

157
00:19:04,007 --> 00:19:05,843
- Boss, look at his height.
- He's big.

158
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,899
- But my heart is bigger.
- Boss, he's a hero.

159
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,057
If he's a hero, I'm
hero's father.

160
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,396
Look at his strong body, Boss.

161
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:12,642
- He's strong..
- So?

162
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:15,157
I have a long black tar road.

163
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,581
I'm proud of our
country just like you.

164
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:18,792
I'm a proud of my country.

165
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:21,848
By the way, do you
know our national song?

166
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:22,827
Vande Mataram.

167
00:19:22,907 --> 00:19:23,607
Can you sing?

168
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:24,438
Yes.

169
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:24,969
Sing.

170
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,478
Actually, I used to sing it
on stage in school every day.

171
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,683
- Okay. Sing.
- Now?

172
00:19:30,726 --> 00:19:34,015
Yes, why not? Begin.

173
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:38,105
"Vande Mataram!"
(Mother, I praise thee!)

174
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:41,752
"Vande Mataram!"

175
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,980
It's okay. Give me your phone.

176
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:49,227
Come.

177
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:56,871
Nationalism and selfie,
are two different things.

178
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,195
Nothing, sir.

179
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,662
Excuse me.

180
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:27,917
- Hi.
- Hi!

181
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,629
Can you please stand up?

182
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:32,246
Okay.

183
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,070
What is it?

184
00:21:40,286 --> 00:21:41,371
Harish!

185
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:49,024
Nandini makes an entry, my
heart jumps with excitement.

186
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:51,721
Ding-dong-ding! Hold
this, I'll be back.

187
00:21:51,801 --> 00:21:54,066
I'm coming!

188
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,084
What is it, dear?

189
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:01,704
Can you get that stone here?

190
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:03,315
Please?

191
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,614
Nandini. Oh, yes..

192
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:14,662
There's no need to say thanks.
It is to be said to strangers.

193
00:22:14,723 --> 00:22:16,872
But I'm yours.

194
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:23,265
Wish me luck, okay!

195
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:25,931
Yes?

196
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,043
"Vande Mataram!"

197
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:33,833
"Rich with thy hurrying streams,
bright with orchard gleams,"

198
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:37,124
"Cool with thy
winds of delight,"

199
00:22:37,318 --> 00:22:40,985
"Dark fields waving
Mother of might,"

200
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:44,232
"Vande Mataram!"

201
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,548
"Vande Mataram!"

202
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:54,317
Nandini doesn't even move a
stone without my permission.

203
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,975
I'm a nationalist too.
Do you believe now?

204
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:03,356
Your voice is sweet.

205
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,891
Actually, singing was my
hobby since school days!

206
00:23:05,972 --> 00:23:08,898
I couldn't sing that day because
you asked me out of the blue.

207
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:11,287
Infact I've got many
awards too for singing.

208
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:12,486
One selfie..

209
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,924
- We did take one yesterday,right?
- No!

210
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:18,096
I posted that one
yesterday in Facebook.

211
00:23:18,174 --> 00:23:21,016
We look so good!
Look at the likes!

212
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:24,196
Our pair looks
amazing, doesn't it?

213
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:27,283
Who wrote this comment?

214
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:28,486
I think it was about me..

215
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:29,455
- Harish!
- Yes, Nandini?

216
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,121
- Was it about me?
- I'll see you soon!

217
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,301
Yeah, I'm coming!

218
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:36,819
- Jai Hind, Sir.
- Congratulations!

219
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:38,563
Congratulations on your wedding!

220
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:39,931
- Marriage?
- Yes.

221
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:40,822
- Whose?
- Your.

222
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,445
With Dr. Nandani.

223
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:45,698
Right. My marriage
is in Bangalore.

224
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:47,835
I'm going to book ITC
Garden or Hotel Taj.

225
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,534
Wow!

226
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,398
- I've invited friends.
- Okay.

227
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,677
There will be food, vegetarian and
non-vegetarian, and cocktail party.

228
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:56,584
And of course, North Indian
style Punjabi food for you too!

229
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:58,577
- Wow! That's brilliant.
- Amazing!

230
00:23:58,657 --> 00:24:01,280
When did you do all this arrangement?
Tell us.

231
00:24:01,451 --> 00:24:04,131
You will do the
arrangement, why would I?

232
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:05,909
You're so funny!

233
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:07,095
- Is the wedding confirmed?
- Captain..

234
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,026
- ..there's a letter for you.
- Yes.

235
00:24:09,065 --> 00:24:12,112
It's here! The love-letter from
the neighbour tent is here!

236
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,533
Now both of them will
play Doctor-doctor!

237
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,740
- Thank you.
- Jai Hind, Sir.

238
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,750
What's written?

239
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,727
Read loudly, Sir!

240
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,676
Let us know what's in it!

241
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,405
What happened?

242
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:28,198
- He's so quiet!
- I can't wait to know what's in it!

243
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,709
I think it's really romantic.

244
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:42,687
- Tell us!
- Read it!

245
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:44,795
I'm reading it, have patience!

246
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:46,876
Read it already!

247
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,900
Your brother is no more!
Start Immediately

248
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:17,725
Uncle!

249
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:28,422
My father!

250
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,832
What happened?

251
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,711
It's clear.

252
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:15,450
He committed suicide.

253
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:19,031
My brother was a rival to none.

254
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:22,445
And he wasn't a coward
that he commit suicide.

255
00:29:22,632 --> 00:29:24,482
What happened?

256
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:28,956
Ram, I know you two
were very close.

257
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,620
I understand.

258
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:34,027
He was my sister's husband.

259
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,762
I was present during
the investigation.

260
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:40,028
Let's be practical, Ram.

261
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:42,132
It's useless to
complicate things..

262
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:49,795
Being his younger brother, I have a
right to know what happened to him.

263
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:52,426
If I be practical..

264
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:56,449
I'm not requesting
you, I'm asking you.

265
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:58,557
What happened?

266
00:30:01,785 --> 00:30:04,396
Sir, we have court's orders. We
have to demolish this building.

267
00:30:04,476 --> 00:30:08,228
The officer that messes with
me, is never seen again.

268
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:11,670
If any of you have even
a tiny bit of courage..

269
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,575
then demolish it.

270
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:16,299
We won't do it, Sir. But our new
Commissioner won't spare you.

271
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:18,402
Who's that joker?

272
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:22,304
You must have seen stars
only on police's uniform..

273
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:24,719
but stars favour his luck.

274
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:30,539
Injustice shivers at his name.

275
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:33,971
He's the icon of justice.

276
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:41,102
Who're you?

277
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:44,850
There no need to give
you my introduction.

278
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:47,976
You have no capability
to know who I am.

279
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:51,067
But you don't know who I am.

280
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:55,237
You're that goon who snatches lands
and makes buildings on the same.

281
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:58,205
I'll transfer you to such a place where
you won't even get water to drink.

282
00:30:58,262 --> 00:31:01,179
Step forward, if you dare.

283
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,344
Run!

284
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:28,940
Hey? Hey! Are you mad?
What are you doing?

285
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,714
Hey! You want to kill me?

286
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:41,034
Hey, if you can have so much pride
by being in power for five years..

287
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:46,781
then imagine how much pride I would have,
being in the powerful post for 58 years.

288
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:48,143
- Come, Inspector.
- Sir.

289
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:50,374
Obstructing Government
officers' duties..

290
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:53,058
and for the crime of
threatening them, arrest him.

291
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,771
Are you mad? Reconsider.

292
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:58,073
One reconsiders when
he does a wrong thing.

293
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:01,090
It takes no reconsideration
to do the right.

294
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,728
- I won't spare you!
- Hey!

295
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:06,016
I'm an Administrative officer,
not some sage.

296
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:09,003
I'll kill you if
you mess with me.

297
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:10,158
- Officers.
- Sir.

298
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:12,989
- Demolish the building.
- Okay, Sir.

299
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:22,498
After some days, that
corporator got out of jail.

300
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:25,225
And created a ruckus
outside your house.

301
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,209
Get out! Aren't you a man?

302
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:29,493
Mom!

303
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,392
Let me go!

304
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:32,929
Hey! You'll regret it.

305
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,233
I will destroy you
and your family!

306
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:37,132
Your brother was
very hot-tempered.

307
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:40,919
So he went to the corporator's
house for revenge.

308
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,929
He was really angry.

309
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,745
He shot him with the
corporator's own gun.

310
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:57,957
He was arrested
because of murder.

311
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:02,683
I bailed him out,
and got him home.

312
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,508
And the very next day..

313
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:17,181
He committed suicide.

314
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:46,949
Look it's a clear case of suicide.
Police investigation has ended.

315
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:50,572
Post-mortem report tells us the same.
What do you think?

316
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,364
This is a murder, not a suicide.

317
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,678
Stop being unrealistic.

318
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:00,107
You're being over-emotional.

319
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,381
The entire room was
full of evidences.

320
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:06,118
- What do you mean?
- Evidence number 1...

321
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:10,556
In my brother's personal room..

322
00:34:10,636 --> 00:34:14,722
..I could still smell weed from
the curtain beside the table.

323
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:23,674
That means whoever came into the room,
his height might be 6'2" or 6'3".

324
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,792
Evidence number 2, the
bean bag in his room.

325
00:34:27,096 --> 00:34:31,585
It looked as if a heavy or
a tall person sat on it.

326
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:36,599
That means the killer's
weight must be around 100kg.

327
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:40,421
Brother didn't like dust and that's
why he always kept his window open.

328
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:41,564
Even if he had sat..

329
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,206
..it's impossible for the bean bag
to have such a big impression.

330
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,624
Evidence number 3...

331
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:48,913
..tell me did you find any
fingerprints on my brother's computer?

332
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,868
According to reports, none.

333
00:34:50,948 --> 00:34:52,709
- Why?
- Impossible.

334
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,346
I couldn't find brother's
fingerprints as well.

335
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,387
That means killer used
gloves to use the computer..

336
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:01,602
and wiped away all
the fingerprints.

337
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:08,782
Last evidence is the rope
around my brother's neck.

338
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:11,385
Did you notice the knot?

339
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:14,193
Whoever tied it,
was left-handed.

340
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:17,349
Whereas, my brother
was right-handed.

341
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:34,533
How could I commit
such a big mistake?

342
00:35:34,713 --> 00:35:38,155
I think they missed all
of this on purpose.

343
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,990
I'm not blaming your department.

344
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:51,235
But it's very difficult to conceal an IAS
officer's murder without police's aid.

345
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:55,813
Ram.

346
00:35:58,066 --> 00:36:01,390
I'll investigate this
case personally.

347
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:12,914
Inform the forensic department
as soon as possible..

348
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,382
I'm reinvestigating
the Satyamurthy case.

349
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:20,366
I need the names of all the
criminals with height 6'2"-6'3".

350
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:23,454
- Excuse me.
- Yes, Sir?

351
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,551
Where can I find Dr. Ravindra?

352
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:26,555
There's his office.

353
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:27,865
- There?
- Yes.

354
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,143
Tell me.

355
00:36:36,223 --> 00:36:38,298
Ram has come to meet Dr.
Ravindra.

356
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:42,010
- I want to meet Dr. Ravindra.
- Actually Ravindra Sir is..

357
00:36:42,861 --> 00:36:45,083
He is on leave for many days.

358
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:52,161
Oh my God!

359
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:53,625
He's here!

360
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:57,044
- You guys go!
- Okay.

361
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:08,155
Hi!

362
00:37:09,066 --> 00:37:11,784
- Hey.
- How come you're here?

363
00:37:12,308 --> 00:37:13,889
I was here to meet Dr. Ravindra.

364
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:15,604
Oh. So did you meet him?

365
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:16,778
No, he's on leave.

366
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:18,617
What? Dr. Ravindra is on leave?

367
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,212
Someone lied to you.

368
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:23,536
- Oh.
- I know where he is, come.

369
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,635
I'll take you there.

370
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:28,099
I told you so. You'll
find him here.

371
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,813
Hi, Doctor.

372
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:33,317
He's the younger brother of
IAS Officer Satyamurthy.

373
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:34,684
He wants to meet you.

374
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:36,985
I want to speak to him privately.
Can I?

375
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,542
- Of course.
- Thank you.

376
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:39,710
Yeah.

377
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:42,407
May I sit?

378
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:44,946
Thank you.

379
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:55,328
I read the post-mortem
report of my brother..

380
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,816
..IAS Officer Satyamurthy,
which you made.

381
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,074
What about it?

382
00:37:58,551 --> 00:37:59,696
Nothing.

383
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,660
If someone hangs himself
to commit suicide..

384
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,770
..there's always a 'V'
mark on his neck.

385
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:09,156
If someone else does that
forcibly, there's an 'O' mark.

386
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:12,207
There's an 'O' mark
on my brother's neck.

387
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:14,240
The report's true, isn't it?

388
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,478
What do you mean?

389
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:18,385
Anyone would tell me anything
and I'll change the report?

390
00:38:18,782 --> 00:38:20,888
When did I say that? You
said that yourself.

391
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:24,477
Listen, use your brain on the
border for you're an army officer.

392
00:38:24,557 --> 00:38:26,526
There's no need to lecture
me about anything.

393
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:32,595
This report has been made
after the post-mortem.

394
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:35,891
If you think there's any problem,
go and report the police.

395
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:38,623
I have no time for
your nonsense.

396
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:40,120
You may leave.

397
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:48,158
You said a lot without
saying anything.

398
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,150
I'll return soon.

399
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,905
"Hebbuli!" (Ferocious Tiger)

400
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:57,819
"Hebbuli!"

401
00:38:58,592 --> 00:39:01,611
"Hebbuli!"

402
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:05,632
- The pigeon flew away!
- Shut up.

403
00:39:06,223 --> 00:39:08,252
Where are you flying to?

404
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:11,005
- Did you talk to him?
- Yes.

405
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:12,985
- I think something's wrong, Boss.
- Hey!

406
00:39:13,065 --> 00:39:14,693
Stop saying 1947 dialogues.

407
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,349
I thought this friendship would have
got martyred on the border itself.

408
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:20,643
But look at his daring, Boss.
He even came to the hospital.

409
00:39:20,723 --> 00:39:22,263
You think so negatively.

410
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:25,095
This is a hospital. He must have
come to cure his stomach ache.

411
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,090
I think Fortune is
not on your side.

412
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:28,939
He looks like Superman.

413
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,637
And you say that he's a patient?

414
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,613
Can I have your number?

415
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,686
Boss, she's taking his number!

416
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:35,087
I don't use a phone. Sorry.

417
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:39,170
Your home address, residence
number, anything?

418
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:41,116
I'm going to shift
to another place.

419
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:42,666
You're so innocent!

420
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,732
It starts with chatting, moves
on to meeting and then wedding.

421
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:48,645
Then he'll pick her up, and drop
her from and to home respectively.

422
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,970
And then after marriage..

423
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:57,430
Don't forget to give me your
address after you shift.

424
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,536
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

425
00:40:01,553 --> 00:40:03,997
My heart's desires
flowed away in tears?

426
00:40:04,077 --> 00:40:05,107
- Bye!
- Bye.

427
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:06,232
Don't forget.

428
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:07,548
I spared him for he's a
young Indian soldier..

429
00:40:07,594 --> 00:40:09,746
..otherwise I would have
destroyed his youth.

430
00:40:31,669 --> 00:40:33,155
Mom!

431
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:35,992
Why are you crying?

432
00:40:36,949 --> 00:40:38,593
What happened, dear?

433
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,984
Was Dad a bad man?

434
00:40:40,084 --> 00:40:41,448
Who told you?

435
00:40:41,528 --> 00:40:43,502
My friends are saying so.

436
00:40:43,582 --> 00:40:45,768
Ritu, come here.

437
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:50,299
Come. Sit.

438
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:56,710
- Who knows your Dad the most?
- Me.

439
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,263
Right? Who else?

440
00:40:58,306 --> 00:40:59,878
- I don't know.
- Don't know?

441
00:40:59,972 --> 00:41:00,803
Me.

442
00:41:01,255 --> 00:41:03,114
You must not know him
that well like I do.

443
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,932
Oh, I don't.

444
00:41:05,278 --> 00:41:07,032
Okay, so you know him, right?

445
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:10,830
Was he a bad person?

446
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,787
No, right? Then don't worry.

447
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,274
Okay, don't worry.

448
00:41:16,732 --> 00:41:19,670
He always used to
fight for justice.

449
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,830
He used to punch his
enemies and put them down.

450
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,552
Your Dad was a great man.

451
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:27,697
Like Superman?

452
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,970
Superhuman!

453
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:35,180
Never think wrong about him.

454
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:41,885
Sister-in-law, I can understand
what you're going through.

455
00:41:41,971 --> 00:41:44,244
Please, Sister-in-law.

456
00:41:45,884 --> 00:41:48,893
Was brother ever worried
about anything?

457
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,927
Think and tell me.

458
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:57,203
Was he under anyone's pressure,
or was he tensed about anything?

459
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,441
I just know about the
driver's daughter.

460
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:01,987
- Hello, Madam.
- Hello.

461
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:05,433
I'm sorry, I am late because I
took my daughter to the hospital.

462
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:07,994
You're right on time, Shankar.
Right?

463
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,584
He could've come even later.

464
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:11,866
You both talk, I'll get coffee.

465
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,831
Come, dear! Come to me.

466
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,064
Go, dear.

467
00:42:15,144 --> 00:42:16,347
I heard you went
to the hospital?

468
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:19,911
I am unwell since
last night, uncle.

469
00:42:20,057 --> 00:42:22,417
She has fever but
she's fine now.

470
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,066
Why are you looking around?

471
00:42:25,082 --> 00:42:28,738
Why is our house so small,
and yours so big, uncle?

472
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:32,269
Shut up! Sir is an officer that's why.
Understood?

473
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,179
Why are you scolding her?

474
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:37,333
You want a bigger house? Why?

475
00:42:37,413 --> 00:42:41,847
Our house is enough only for
my father, mother and me.

476
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:47,567
Whenever my friends come over for my
birthday, there's no space for them.

477
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:50,822
If you study hard and
become an officer like me..

478
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,650
..you'll have a bigger
house than mine.

479
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:54,507
- Really?
- Yes.

480
00:42:54,994 --> 00:42:57,933
- Tell me, do you want to study?
- Yes!

481
00:42:57,965 --> 00:42:59,095
Great!

482
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,273
Dad, did you hear
what uncle said?

483
00:43:03,753 --> 00:43:06,020
If you study hard and become
an officer like him..

484
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,084
..we'll have a bigger
house than his.

485
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:11,253
Then we will celebrate your birthday,
Mom's birthday and my birthday..

486
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:14,260
at our home only, right, Dad?

487
00:43:14,312 --> 00:43:15,991
Yes, dear!

488
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:29,319
Then, one day, we got news that Shankar
committed suicide along with his family.

489
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,090
- His daughter had cancer!
- Cancer?

490
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,967
She was in the final stage.

491
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:37,429
He couldn't repay the loan
he took for her treatment.

492
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:42,589
And he committed suicide for
he couldn't save his daughter.

493
00:43:44,736 --> 00:43:48,579
He was very upset about
Shankar and his family.

494
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:52,382
He thought that Shankar
took this step since..

495
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:54,539
..he had no money
for her treatment.

496
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:59,781
He loved Shankar's daughter as his own.
And he constantly thought about her.

497
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:05,620
Dad, I've heard that poor people
can't survive if they get cancer..

498
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:06,951
Who told you this?

499
00:44:06,991 --> 00:44:10,447
I heard Aunt Kamla saying this.

500
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,739
It's not like that, and I found out that
her treatment was not done properly.

501
00:44:14,827 --> 00:44:18,764
- But why?
- Her poverty was the cause of her death.

502
00:44:18,844 --> 00:44:21,683
That means Aunt Kamla was right.

503
00:44:22,164 --> 00:44:25,314
If poor people get cancer,
they can't survive.

504
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:28,683
Stop listening to such
things and go to play.

505
00:44:28,716 --> 00:44:29,991
Okay.

506
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:34,024
I don't know what happened
to him after that.

507
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:38,103
He used to stay in his room for
hours, working on the computer.

508
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,261
One day, when he wasn't home..

509
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:46,815
The corporator entered our
house and threatened us.

510
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:50,180
When I told him this,
he got very angry.

511
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,390
And he went to his
house in wrath.

512
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:54,992
The next day, police
arrested him as they..

513
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,137
..found him guilty of
killing the corporator.

514
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,173
He was fired from the job.

515
00:44:59,175 --> 00:45:01,765
My brother bailed him
and got him home.

516
00:45:01,862 --> 00:45:03,904
He looked quite
upset after that.

517
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,207
Have food.

518
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,188
You won't ask me anything?

519
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,765
I can read your mind even
if you don't say anything.

520
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,145
I didn't kill him.

521
00:45:13,221 --> 00:45:15,303
You're the icon of justice.

522
00:45:15,362 --> 00:45:17,723
I know you did nothing.

523
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,830
But whose life is
free from troubles?

524
00:45:20,912 --> 00:45:23,971
It will be alright
someday, let's go.

525
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,634
I want to tell you something.

526
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,214
Have food first, talk later.

527
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,675
He sat there till
we were not asleep.

528
00:45:38,692 --> 00:45:41,625
After that he went
to his study room.

529
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:50,452
The next morning when I entered
in his room with coffee..

530
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:56,068
He wanted to tell me something..

531
00:45:56,088 --> 00:45:59,243
but I didn't listen to him.

532
00:46:16,623 --> 00:46:18,356
- Isn't it cute?
- Sister-in-law..

533
00:46:18,683 --> 00:46:19,686
Hi!

534
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:21,087
Surprise!

535
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:22,611
You? Here?

536
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:25,470
You both talk, I'll get coffee.

537
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,541
Okay, Sister-in-law.

538
00:46:26,591 --> 00:46:29,254
Sister-in-law, did
you see my phone?

539
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:33,101
Is this your phone?

540
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:36,357
- No. Why?
- Then this?

541
00:46:37,192 --> 00:46:38,621
How did you get my phone?

542
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,574
Why did you lie to
me about your phone?

543
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:43,980
Okay, I forgive you.

544
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:47,227
Your phone is outdated, that's
why I got a new one for you.

545
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,860
It's the latest model!

546
00:46:49,044 --> 00:46:50,523
With unlimited talk time.

547
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:52,522
Thank you, but I'm
happy with my old one.

548
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:55,952
It's rude to refuse
things given out of love.

549
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:57,790
I said I don't want it.

550
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,357
Poor girl! She bought it for
you out of so much love!

551
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,595
- She'll feel bad if you don't take it.
- No, I..

552
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:05,766
Sister-in-law said so.
You'll have to keep it.

553
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,706
I've saved your new number.

554
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,873
- But, I need my old phone..
- Have coffee.

555
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:12,329
Thank you!

556
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:14,498
Sit!

557
00:47:18,744 --> 00:47:20,818
Coffee was amazing!

558
00:47:22,126 --> 00:47:24,632
You must be late?
Thanks for coming.

559
00:47:24,847 --> 00:47:26,456
I'll come again!

560
00:47:26,536 --> 00:47:27,300
- Bye!
- Bye.

561
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,256
See you soon.

562
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:29,605
Thank you.

563
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,066
I have downloaded Facebook
and Whatsapp on your phone.

564
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:35,011
I have uploaded our
photo to Facebook also.

565
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:36,846
I have stored my number too.

566
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,829
- Do call me.
- Yeah.

567
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:42,387
- Bye.
- Bye.

568
00:48:25,075 --> 00:48:27,330
"Hebbuli!"

569
00:48:33,863 --> 00:48:38,392
We are investigating all left-handed
criminals of height 6'2"-6'3".

570
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:44,006
Sir, all these people have no
connection with the murder.

571
00:48:44,086 --> 00:48:48,062
We have evidence. They were not present
there when the murder happened.

572
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:52,693
And every person from Shivaji Nagar
except Faiyaz Ali are present here, Sir.

573
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:56,144
If everyone are here, why isn't he?
Get him right away!

574
00:48:56,151 --> 00:48:57,833
We are trying our best.

575
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,211
I don't want such excuses,
just get him here.

576
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:03,333
- Get him here already!
- Okay, Sir.

577
00:49:13,657 --> 00:49:17,804
'Faiyaz has been killed',
someone put up such a poster!

578
00:49:19,174 --> 00:49:21,465
Hey, who's that?

579
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:36,489
Matching...

580
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:42,513
Left hander.

581
00:49:43,537 --> 00:49:45,537
Hesitation...

582
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:48,261
Perfect match!

583
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,940
- May I talk to him for a minute?
- Hey!

584
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,202
How dare you talk like that?

585
00:49:55,905 --> 00:49:57,946
Hey, who're you?

586
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:01,347
What's your blood group?

587
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:03,069
O+ve.

588
00:50:04,341 --> 00:50:06,641
Who all have O+ve
blood group here?

589
00:50:07,648 --> 00:50:11,500
You two, come this side,
he'll need blood.

590
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,301
May I talk to you now?

591
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:17,148
Hey, how dare you
threaten us in our area?

592
00:50:17,228 --> 00:50:19,445
Who're you, Mr. Over-smart?

593
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:26,962
- What did you say?
- How dare you..

594
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:32,313
I'm standing in your area unarmed and
alone and you're talking about daring?

595
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:38,121
Rats change their area
after the tiger's entry.

596
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:43,904
"Hebbuli!"

597
00:50:46,936 --> 00:50:48,799
Hey, handle him!

598
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,085
"Hebbuli!"

599
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:02,156
Hey! Take care of him!

600
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:17,869
Why don't you all help me?

601
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:08,530
This handsome, strong, young man is Kabir.
Business, trade..

602
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,840
He handles the all the
illegal businesses.

603
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,906
He is peaceful to those
who agree to him.

604
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:15,676
The one who rebels, is
sent to hell by him.

605
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:43,772
I hate two kinds of people.

606
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:48,981
Those who don't listen to me,
and those who betray me.

607
00:52:49,056 --> 00:52:50,649
Do or die?

608
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:53,422
I'll go underground
for a year, Boss.

609
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:03,296
I told you never to show
me your dirty face again!

610
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,578
Someone killed Faiyaz Ali from
Shivaji Nagar before the enquiry.

611
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:31,380
- Hello, Sir?
- Yes, I got it.

612
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,057
I'm coming.

613
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:37,041
I think somewhere he's connected
to your brother's case.

614
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:39,996
By the way, CBI will
handle his case now.

615
00:53:40,076 --> 00:53:42,246
I thought you should know.

616
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:45,369
Did you ever see this logo?

617
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,814
I searched all over Google,
internet, couldn't find it.

618
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,761
Do you have any idea?

619
00:54:48,772 --> 00:54:49,812
I think I have seen it.

620
00:54:49,892 --> 00:54:50,975
- Yeah?
- Yes.

621
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:54,331
Did you ever see him?

622
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:56,557
Anywhere?

623
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,618
No.

624
00:54:58,882 --> 00:55:01,925
But I have the logo somewhere.

625
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,347
Photo?

626
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:07,102
Newspaper?

627
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:09,049
Television ads? Memes?

628
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:10,685
No, no. Wait.

629
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:12,519
I think..

630
00:55:12,557 --> 00:55:13,660
You think?

631
00:55:13,837 --> 00:55:14,861
I guess..

632
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,972
I have seen it on the
road I come from.

633
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:22,066
Let's go.

634
00:55:22,548 --> 00:55:23,221
Now?

635
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:26,599
Why, are you busy?
Sorry, I didn't ask you.

636
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:28,862
No.. Hey!

637
00:55:38,379 --> 00:55:39,544
Here.

638
00:55:41,232 --> 00:55:42,719
Hello?

639
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:44,273
Hi, I'm out right now.

640
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:46,108
I'll call you back, okay?

641
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:50,202
- I wanted to become a doctor for Nandini.
- Oh!

642
00:55:50,282 --> 00:55:53,661
Just see how I surprise Nandini
on her birthday today!

643
00:55:53,741 --> 00:55:55,017
Great, Boss.

644
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:10,254
It's over, Boss.

645
00:56:12,424 --> 00:56:15,374
Hey, is it necessary that a boy and a
girl are lovers if they're on a bike?

646
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:16,745
Can't they be siblings?

647
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:21,041
Nowadays siblings can't roam freely
just because people like you!

648
00:56:21,536 --> 00:56:24,371
Look! It's that logo.It's
the logo of a gym.

649
00:56:24,385 --> 00:56:28,983
They have two branches, one in
Malleshwaram and other in Jayanagar.

650
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:34,660
If the logo's here, there's definitely
some connection with the gym.

651
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,086
Hey, Sweety. Thank you for calling
but I'll call you back, alright?

652
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:39,723
Thanks, bye.

653
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:41,384
Are you free tomorrow morning?

654
00:56:41,405 --> 00:56:42,414
Why?

655
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:45,870
You can keep an eye on this branch and
I will do the same on the other one.

656
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:51,410
I meant you can keep a watch on one
branch and I can on the other.

657
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,161
No problem, you may pick it up.
It's fine.

658
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,796
In fact, I brought you here
without your consent..

659
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,308
Sorry, you can continue.

660
00:56:57,388 --> 00:57:00,158
No, it's my birthday.

661
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:09,853
Thanks.

662
00:57:13,873 --> 00:57:15,627
I want to tell you something.

663
00:57:15,654 --> 00:57:17,575
If you don't mind.

664
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:20,200
Are you going to propose me?

665
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:22,975
Sorry.

666
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:30,828
What do you think? I won't understand
that you love me even if you don't tell?

667
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:34,536
I'm not that dumb or insensitive.
I know.

668
00:57:35,323 --> 00:57:39,180
But you should know one thing, I have
other important things in my life too.

669
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,833
My aim doesn't let me think
about such things in my life.

670
00:57:44,415 --> 00:57:46,686
I don't know when
all this will end.

671
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:50,432
And on top of it, I don't want
to put your life in danger.

672
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:54,343
I want you to look for your
life's happiness elsewhere.

673
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,662
Now may I say something?

674
00:57:59,806 --> 00:58:00,882
Sure.

675
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:03,892
I can understand the relation
between you and your brother..

676
00:58:03,945 --> 00:58:07,862
those emotions and
your aim very well.

677
00:58:08,046 --> 00:58:11,139
In fact, I did not share
my feelings with you.

678
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,872
Probably, if I were in your place,
I would have said the same.

679
00:58:16,135 --> 00:58:19,277
You told me to look for
my happiness elsewhere.

680
00:58:19,893 --> 00:58:23,116
Of course, this is my happiness.

681
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:24,600
With you.

682
00:58:25,646 --> 00:58:28,323
Just like I am respecting
your feelings..

683
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:31,720
you should do the same
for mine as well.

684
00:58:32,795 --> 00:58:34,675
By the way..

685
00:58:36,618 --> 00:58:38,511
You said so many
things till now..

686
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:40,476
but you didn't say even once..

687
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:43,607
that you don't love me.

688
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,494
- Let me tell you a great joke.
- Go ahead, Boss.

689
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,155
I'm busy right now,
I'll tell it later.

690
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,006
Right here.

691
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:33,025
- Because that gym's branch is here also.
- Okay.

692
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:34,343
- Take care.
- Okay.

693
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,267
Nandini! Give me your phone.

694
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:41,179
I'm tracking your GPS.
Keep this in your pocket.

695
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:42,680
Did you see, Boss?

696
01:02:42,733 --> 01:02:44,606
Why are you putting
oil to the fire?

697
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:48,518
- Bye.
- Take care.

698
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,880
Don't you understand what I say?
Think positive.

699
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,998
Every friend is necessary.

700
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,173
Pay the bill or you'll
have to do the dishes.

701
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:02,850
Hi, Workout's over?

702
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:03,835
Yeah.

703
01:03:12,738 --> 01:03:14,361
- Sir, tea.
- Thank you.

704
01:03:50,948 --> 01:03:52,592
- Yes, tell me.
- Hi.

705
01:03:52,725 --> 01:03:54,772
I wanted to ask about
the membership.

706
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,135
Advance is Rs. 5000..

707
01:03:57,215 --> 01:04:00,730
- You have to pay Rs. 3000 every
consecutive month. - Okay.

708
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,180
Right now, we are
offering a discount.

709
01:04:03,203 --> 01:04:05,129
Thank you.

710
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:14,018
The man we're looking for, who has a
tattoo on his hands, is in this gym.

711
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:15,993
- I'm coming.
- Okay, come fast.

712
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:18,249
Excuse me, please.

713
01:04:34,212 --> 01:04:36,262
- Madam, what did you do?
- Sorry.

714
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:39,274
Keep it back.

715
01:04:54,346 --> 01:04:57,692
Hello? There's a girl
who's following me.

716
01:04:57,772 --> 01:05:00,911
Get some men and come
into the factory.

717
01:05:34,337 --> 01:05:36,687
Great, brother. A girl is
giving you attention..

718
01:05:36,717 --> 01:05:40,190
..and you called us here
to play the gooseberry?

719
01:05:40,247 --> 01:05:41,798
- Excuse me?
- Brother!

720
01:05:41,799 --> 01:05:43,503
Brother, doll starts talking.
for you.

721
01:05:43,562 --> 01:05:45,354
I need to make a call.

722
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:47,726
Is it to your boyfriend?

723
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:53,471
Do you think your boyfriend would come
and bash us the moment you call him?

724
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:54,664
And save you too?

725
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:56,889
Is your boyfriend some hero?

726
01:05:56,912 --> 01:05:59,325
Just one call, please.

727
01:05:59,405 --> 01:06:01,792
Okay, just one.

728
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:04,530
But on one condition.

729
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:08,512
We will just wait 2 minutes
for your hero's entry.

730
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:13,056
If he doesn't come, you'll
have to do as I say.

731
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,438
Yes.

732
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:21,169
What? Isn't he picking up?

733
01:06:22,025 --> 01:06:24,102
I think he's busy.

734
01:06:24,104 --> 01:06:25,938
I don't care about all that.

735
01:06:25,996 --> 01:06:28,600
The time limit I
gave you is over.

736
01:06:28,637 --> 01:06:30,692
- Ten.
- Nine.

737
01:06:30,772 --> 01:06:32,313
- Eight.
- Seven.

738
01:06:32,393 --> 01:06:34,243
- Six.
- Five.

739
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,897
- Four.
- Three.

740
01:06:39,482 --> 01:06:41,317
"Hebbuli!"

741
01:06:57,269 --> 01:06:59,821
Who are you?

742
01:07:00,459 --> 01:07:03,243
He's my hero.

743
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,836
May I talk to you for a minute?

744
01:07:17,916 --> 01:07:21,394
When a jackal wants to die,
he comes to the tiger.

745
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:23,867
Shut the shutter.
Let's finish him.

746
01:07:23,947 --> 01:07:26,803
Don't do this, or
you'll regret it.

747
01:07:26,883 --> 01:07:29,596
Why? You'll beat us?

748
01:07:32,765 --> 01:07:39,001
Normally, I don't beat anyone, but
when I do, he becomes abnormal.

749
01:07:43,204 --> 01:07:46,199
"Hebbuli!"

750
01:07:49,818 --> 01:07:52,207
"Hebbuli!"

751
01:08:09,164 --> 01:08:11,543
Now may I talk for a minute?

752
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,143
"Hebbuli!"

753
01:08:52,548 --> 01:08:54,328
"Hebbuli!"

754
01:08:55,921 --> 01:08:57,458
"Hebbuli!"

755
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:00,899
"Hebbuli!"

756
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,956
You don't know them!
They're very dangerous.

757
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:52,972
Listen to me, go away!

758
01:09:53,052 --> 01:09:53,876
Who?

759
01:09:53,956 --> 01:10:01,545
If they find out, they'll kill
me as well as you! Just go away!

760
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:04,825
Who?

761
01:10:05,813 --> 01:10:08,449
- Why doesn't he understand me?
- Who?

762
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:10,784
They'll kill my family,
don't you understand?

763
01:10:10,864 --> 01:10:11,475
Who?

764
01:10:12,068 --> 01:10:14,133
Hey, why can't you understand?

765
01:10:14,213 --> 01:10:16,235
They'll destroy my family.

766
01:10:16,315 --> 01:10:19,385
They are not humans!
They are beasts!

767
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,444
Hey!

768
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:57,111
- Ranveer?
- Yes, Captain Ram?

769
01:10:57,191 --> 01:10:58,662
Note a number.

770
01:10:58,905 --> 01:11:00,273
Tell me, Sir.

771
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:02,577
I need the call
details right now.

772
01:11:02,587 --> 01:11:03,913
Yes, Sir. On it.

773
01:11:03,989 --> 01:11:05,457
Mail me about it as
soon as possible.

774
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,525
Okay, Sir.

775
01:11:27,281 --> 01:11:27,984
Yes, Captain Ram?

776
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:28,968
- Ranveer?
- Sir.

777
01:11:29,055 --> 01:11:31,207
I need the exact location
of these numbers.

778
01:11:31,306 --> 01:11:33,771
Call on it with your
private number.

779
01:11:33,774 --> 01:11:38,262
Record the call and make a voice match.
Try to find out who he is.

780
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:39,368
Okay, Sir.

781
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:45,841
Yes, Ranveer.

782
01:11:46,023 --> 01:11:50,843
I have found his location, Sir.
It's latitude 13.0441 degree north.

783
01:11:50,923 --> 01:11:51,816
Okay.

784
01:11:52,562 --> 01:11:53,319
And voice match?

785
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:54,692
The voice match is
also found, Sir.

786
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:56,792
Who is it?

787
01:12:08,984 --> 01:12:10,246
Yes, okay.

788
01:12:10,447 --> 01:12:11,830
Will it be done?

789
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:14,180
Yes, don't worry
it will be done.

790
01:12:38,255 --> 01:12:40,460
Did I tell you to sit?

791
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,168
Sorry, Sir.

792
01:12:45,285 --> 01:12:48,614
Then why are you standing?
Have a seat.

793
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,258
Saturn's anger, since 9 years.

794
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:01,805
My clothes are black but
heart is pure as white.

795
01:13:01,885 --> 01:13:04,017
Hail the lord!

796
01:13:04,283 --> 01:13:05,553
Tell him.

797
01:13:05,633 --> 01:13:07,723
Sir, the thing is..

798
01:13:07,748 --> 01:13:10,253
His father has many
colleges and hospitals.

799
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,360
After his death,he's
here to settle the

800
01:13:13,385 --> 01:13:15,481
property dispute between
him and his brother.

801
01:13:15,482 --> 01:13:17,231
He has no share in it!

802
01:13:17,235 --> 01:13:18,540
What about my share?

803
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:19,218
What?

804
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,221
Are you deaf? What
about my share?

805
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:24,172
Rs.500 million from my side.

806
01:13:24,723 --> 01:13:27,734
I'll give you 100 million more.

807
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:35,825
But the dispute will be cleared, right?
Thank you, Sir.

808
01:13:36,604 --> 01:13:39,958
I'm happy to meet you. I can
never forget your favour.

809
01:13:45,399 --> 01:13:47,687
What's my brother doing here?

810
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:49,605
You were planning to
kill me, weren't you?

811
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:50,934
Why are you here?

812
01:13:51,013 --> 01:13:52,062
What's happening here?

813
01:13:52,065 --> 01:13:53,001
Tell me why did you come?

814
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:55,388
- This is my father's property!
- I made the business grow!

815
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:57,264
50% of the property is mine!

816
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,484
- No, 25% is enough.
- Calm down, you two.

817
01:13:59,678 --> 01:14:00,697
I'll kick you out!

818
01:14:00,777 --> 01:14:01,596
Hey!

819
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:06,020
Why you are all shouting?
Come and have a sit, please.

820
01:14:13,339 --> 01:14:14,966
Would you like to have coffee?

821
01:14:14,982 --> 01:14:16,063
Hey, get it.

822
01:14:16,143 --> 01:14:18,285
Get some coffee.

823
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,261
What? You transferred
900 millions of my

824
01:14:27,286 --> 01:14:29,500
1000 millions property
to your daughter!

825
01:14:29,505 --> 01:14:32,152
You should have thought
a thousand times

826
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:34,734
before coming to the
cunning Anjanappa.

827
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:38,971
If Saturn's anger increases,
everything destroys!

828
01:14:39,051 --> 01:14:40,122
Everything's over.

829
01:14:40,302 --> 01:14:42,234
Don't do such injustice
with us, Sir.

830
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:43,549
Listen to me, Sir.

831
01:14:43,629 --> 01:14:45,711
This is our hard-earned money.
Please, Sir!

832
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:48,566
Don't do this to us, or
we'll be in trouble.

833
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:50,584
This is wrong, Sir.

834
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:53,908
Look, Sir. I had come to
you with a lot of hope.

835
01:14:54,025 --> 01:14:57,992
We'll be destroyed if you do this!
Please, Sir.

836
01:14:58,157 --> 01:15:02,252
If you sign it, then only
you'll go home. Else..

837
01:15:03,096 --> 01:15:04,851
Hail the Lord!

838
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:26,980
Don't even think
that you are safe.

839
01:15:27,043 --> 01:15:29,281
I could have killed you
right now if I wanted.

840
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:30,024
Who're you?

841
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:32,621
IAS Satyamurthy's brother.

842
01:15:33,051 --> 01:15:36,725
You killed my brother. And I
will surely avenge his death.

843
01:15:38,386 --> 01:15:40,731
You can't do anything
without evidence.

844
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:42,622
What evidence do you have?

845
01:15:42,623 --> 01:15:44,204
After my brother's death..

846
01:15:44,282 --> 01:15:47,372
..I received a call from the
same number he had received.

847
01:15:47,511 --> 01:15:50,904
I have recordings of
everyone who call me.

848
01:15:50,987 --> 01:15:53,312
I didn't call you to
give you any proof.

849
01:15:53,357 --> 01:15:56,884
But to tell you that I have
made an entry in your life.

850
01:15:59,048 --> 01:16:02,429
Your days are numbered!

851
01:17:00,113 --> 01:17:02,113
Who are you?

852
01:17:45,637 --> 01:17:47,637
Pick up the phone!

853
01:17:55,519 --> 01:17:56,968
Do you know what happened here?

854
01:17:57,048 --> 01:17:57,843
What happened?

855
01:17:58,146 --> 01:18:01,454
He started firing at my house
and is threatening me!

856
01:18:02,027 --> 01:18:03,206
Who is he?

857
01:18:03,286 --> 01:18:05,973
IAS Satyamurthy's brother,
Para Commando Ram!

858
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:10,362
Owner of the Shah Industries
and Shah empire, Amruth Shah.

859
01:18:11,363 --> 01:18:13,970
He made a big mistake
coming there.

860
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:17,401
From today, forget one step, he
won't even be able to move an inch.

861
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:19,609
Let's put an end.

862
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:22,087
Do anything you want, but fast!

863
01:18:31,577 --> 01:18:34,907
Britishers, get out
of my country!

864
01:18:37,372 --> 01:18:40,118
India is great! Jai Hind!

865
01:18:43,156 --> 01:18:45,674
I found his vehicle, I think he's
inside the school auditorium.

866
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:49,512
Find him quickly, and
shoot him at sight!

867
01:18:50,504 --> 01:18:56,565
Hello. My name is Ritu. I'm Satyamurthy
and Anuradha Satyamurthy's daughter.

868
01:18:56,645 --> 01:19:00,693
All parents teach good
manner to their children.

869
01:19:01,224 --> 01:19:04,856
I will always remember
one thing my Dad said..

870
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:08,272
One reconsiders when
he does a wrong thing.

871
01:19:08,352 --> 01:19:11,365
But it takes no reconsideration
to do the right.

872
01:19:11,445 --> 01:19:15,495
Alas! My Dad is not
with me anymore.

873
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:20,054
I miss him very much.

874
01:19:23,174 --> 01:19:26,406
I will study hard and become
a collector when I grow up.

875
01:19:27,112 --> 01:19:30,399
And I will help
people free of cost.

876
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:33,899
Dad will always be
with me if I do this.

877
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,270
Dad, your princess will always go on the
right path and become an honest officer.

878
01:19:41,038 --> 01:19:43,059
I love you, Dad.

879
01:19:44,595 --> 01:19:46,530
Is she your daughter?

880
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,487
No, she's his
brother's daughter.

881
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:50,281
Is he your husband?

882
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:52,660
How many kids do you have?

883
01:19:53,103 --> 01:19:56,411
Not one yet. It's too early.

884
01:19:56,491 --> 01:20:01,178
Really? In your age I
had four healthy kids!

885
01:20:01,258 --> 01:20:04,810
You should start. Motherhood
is a pride for every woman.

886
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:07,146
I was lying. I'm unmarried yet.

887
01:20:07,492 --> 01:20:12,270
So what? Get married quickly
and do some family planning.

888
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:16,087
To be honest, your children
would look very beautiful!

889
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:21,075
Bye, uncle!

890
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:28,097
A Para commando can never miss his shot.
He could have killed you.

891
01:23:28,448 --> 01:23:31,270
But he didn't do that.

892
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:39,543
He was right. He shot the cup on purpose.
What's his aim?

893
01:23:39,637 --> 01:23:43,145
What does he want from us?

894
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:47,384
Why is he doing this?

895
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,601
Is anyone else supporting him?

896
01:23:49,872 --> 01:23:52,666
Or is he trying for
some evidence?

897
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,761
probably..

898
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:05,085
he wants to reach to me.

899
01:24:08,563 --> 01:24:10,574
Call Kabir.

900
01:24:13,201 --> 01:24:14,825
Any news?

901
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:19,203
He's drinking tea at
a roadside-stall.

902
01:24:19,265 --> 01:24:20,822
Drinking tea?

903
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:23,840
Is he drinking tea?

904
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:26,024
He's setting a trap..

905
01:24:27,805 --> 01:24:29,167
He's setting a trap.

906
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:33,399
He's setting a trap!

907
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:41,307
Call Kabir again! Tell him
to run away from there!

908
01:24:46,112 --> 01:24:47,363
What happened?

909
01:24:47,434 --> 01:24:49,549
- He's not picking up!
- Try again!

910
01:24:55,434 --> 01:24:57,131
Try again!

911
01:25:01,412 --> 01:25:02,699
Hello? Here.

912
01:25:03,273 --> 01:25:05,489
Kabir, get out of
there right now!

913
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:09,262
I said get out right now,
I'll explain later! Move!

914
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:32,201
He is messing with us!

915
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:36,267
He's playing with our minds.
I won't spare him.

916
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,014
Boss, you are looking
like a hero in this suit!

917
01:25:47,094 --> 01:25:50,668
I'll say 'I love you' to her today.
She'll become flat at hearing it!

918
01:25:50,748 --> 01:25:51,791
All the best.

919
01:25:54,623 --> 01:25:55,975
Come.

920
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:57,716
Nandini..

921
01:25:57,796 --> 01:25:59,921
She's coming. You sit.

922
01:26:23,948 --> 01:26:26,003
Boss! Wait.

923
01:26:26,619 --> 01:26:28,008
What happened, Boss?

924
01:26:28,448 --> 01:26:30,405
The soldier won the
battle of love too.

925
01:26:30,486 --> 01:26:32,200
She loves that army man!

926
01:26:32,279 --> 01:26:36,248
Love is not for a loser like me! I'm
going to station to board a train.

927
01:26:36,286 --> 01:26:37,832
- Ouch!
- Oh God!

928
01:26:40,027 --> 01:26:42,481
- Sorry.
- Wait, I'll pick it up.

929
01:26:44,006 --> 01:26:46,282
She's Nandini as well?

930
01:26:55,536 --> 01:26:56,780
Your name is Nandini?

931
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:58,807
Yes. And your name?

932
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:02,034
Preetham!

933
01:27:04,334 --> 01:27:06,955
She turned! Yes!

934
01:27:07,482 --> 01:27:11,293
Here. Go to advocate and change
my name to Preetham from Harish.

935
01:27:11,373 --> 01:27:14,022
Boss, you'll change your
name again for this girl?

936
01:27:14,102 --> 01:27:16,954
If I can become Harish
from Timmegowda for her..

937
01:27:17,034 --> 01:27:20,056
Can't I become Preetham
from Harish for her?

938
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:25,630
My heart is playing guitar
the second I saw her.

939
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:26,684
What about her?

940
01:27:26,764 --> 01:27:28,318
She's the past.

941
01:27:28,398 --> 01:27:29,359
And her?

942
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:30,710
She's the future!

943
01:27:38,845 --> 01:27:40,480
I'm coming, my dear!

944
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,223
Now who will explain that he
looks Preetham(idiot) by face?

945
01:27:54,283 --> 01:27:56,189
- That way.
- Okay.

946
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:34,763
What do you want, Sir?

947
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,787
Ha! Kabir!

948
01:31:01,811 --> 01:31:03,811
Hello!

949
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:12,158
May I know who's on
the line,Please?

950
01:31:12,182 --> 01:31:14,182
May I know who you are.

951
01:31:14,206 --> 01:31:16,356
Are you scared to
tell who you are.

952
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,660
Captain Ram

953
01:31:17,684 --> 01:31:19,684
Good to know my name.

954
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,908
Your partner has entered
your name as "Boss"

955
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:25,320
That does't mean,I can't extract
the real facts from your partner.

956
01:31:25,656 --> 01:31:27,156
All the best.

957
01:31:27,184 --> 01:31:29,584
In my life, I've faced
many people like you.

958
01:31:29,608 --> 01:31:32,608
You've seen many people like
me but you've not seen me.

959
01:31:32,610 --> 01:31:35,048
I'll meet you as
early as possible.

960
01:32:17,036 --> 01:32:20,765
You're making a big mistake!
Who're are you?

961
01:32:23,077 --> 01:32:25,315
You know who I am.

962
01:32:25,348 --> 01:32:27,886
And you know what I want.

963
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:29,884
Are you threatening me?

964
01:32:29,889 --> 01:32:33,632
What can you even do?

965
01:32:33,712 --> 01:32:37,567
Your brother, being a
officer, could do nothing.

966
01:32:37,588 --> 01:32:40,278
If you think I'll get scared..

967
01:32:40,697 --> 01:32:43,859
then this is your
biggest mistake.

968
01:32:46,764 --> 01:32:49,889
When you have decided
to stay shut..

969
01:32:50,669 --> 01:32:53,648
there's no point in
keeping you alive.

970
01:32:53,738 --> 01:32:54,967
Hey!

971
01:32:56,332 --> 01:32:58,575
Hey, are you crazy?

972
01:33:02,695 --> 01:33:06,276
You're commiting a big mistake!
You're not aware of this.

973
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,300
Leave me!

974
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:17,034
Oh God!

975
01:33:31,201 --> 01:33:34,366
Wait, don't kill me!

976
01:33:34,501 --> 01:33:39,677
Wait! Don't kill me!
I said wait!

977
01:33:47,611 --> 01:33:49,854
This all began with..

978
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,641
Generic medicine.

979
01:33:53,268 --> 01:33:57,538
Driver's daughter got cheap treatment and
his entire family committed suicide.

980
01:33:58,346 --> 01:34:02,420
Your brother was gravely
affected by this.

981
01:34:02,463 --> 01:34:06,125
Being a doctor, he tried
to solve this problem.

982
01:34:06,356 --> 01:34:08,490
And he did a lot of research.

983
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,301
He caught up with his old batch
mates and created a report.

984
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:13,784
Sir, Government data tells us..

985
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,760
..that millions of people die
because of expensive treatment.

986
01:34:16,765 --> 01:34:21,260
There's only one way to lower
this number, generic medicine.

987
01:34:21,282 --> 01:34:24,028
Generic means general.
General means for everyone.

988
01:34:24,113 --> 01:34:28,137
Whenever there's a new disease, the
doctors try to discover the cure.

989
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,434
Big companies lead in this race.

990
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,775
And they patent that
cure on their name.

991
01:34:33,779 --> 01:34:36,448
But such brands' medicines
are very expensive.

992
01:34:36,488 --> 01:34:38,906
The common man can't
even think to afford it.

993
01:34:38,986 --> 01:34:42,885
Generic medicine has the same quality,
it has the same effect on the patient.

994
01:34:42,965 --> 01:34:48,182
When the patent is removed, any company
can make that medicine with the formula.

995
01:34:48,262 --> 01:34:49,933
That means the cost
can be lowered.

996
01:34:50,013 --> 01:34:53,328
If cancer treatment costs
Rs.0.2 million a month..

997
01:34:53,408 --> 01:34:57,587
then generic medicine would
cost only Rs.10,000 per month.

998
01:34:57,667 --> 01:35:01,755
Think, a poor man would
benefit so much from this.

999
01:35:01,756 --> 01:35:04,275
If the medicine's cost
would become so low..

1000
01:35:04,278 --> 01:35:06,654
then what about the
quality & the company?

1001
01:35:06,685 --> 01:35:10,054
Our country is called as 'the
pharmaceutical hub of the world'.

1002
01:35:10,134 --> 01:35:14,551
India supplies 50% to 60%
of generic medicine.

1003
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:20,476
If the quality were poor, then America,
Japan, and other countries of the world..

1004
01:35:20,563 --> 01:35:23,242
would not purchase
medicines from India.

1005
01:35:23,255 --> 01:35:27,719
You say that India supplies generic
medicines to many countries..

1006
01:35:27,799 --> 01:35:31,543
and the quality is good too, then why
isn't it in use in our country yet?

1007
01:35:31,624 --> 01:35:33,694
Sir, in the year 2008,

1008
01:35:33,744 --> 01:35:37,177
Indian Government initiated the
'Jan-Aushadhi Campaign' (Medicine for all)

1009
01:35:37,257 --> 01:35:40,539
If this scheme were just a plan in
the paper, and were not executed..

1010
01:35:40,619 --> 01:35:45,923
medicines for small illnesses like
cold and fever would have been costly.

1011
01:35:46,139 --> 01:35:49,178
Big pharmaceutical firms
have used such strategy..

1012
01:35:49,258 --> 01:35:50,929
that the medicines
have become costly.

1013
01:35:51,009 --> 01:35:56,519
I say, generic medicine should be
available for both urban and rural poor.

1014
01:35:56,599 --> 01:36:02,368
If health care is Government's aim, it
should also aim to provide it cheap.

1015
01:36:02,595 --> 01:36:06,303
And there's only one solution. Cheap
medicines, that is generic medicine.

1016
01:36:07,968 --> 01:36:12,393
You prepare this proposal right away.
I'll get its approval.

1017
01:36:12,407 --> 01:36:18,412
Minister Anjanappa took that report and
made a business deal with my boss.

1018
01:36:20,759 --> 01:36:22,007
Thank you!

1019
01:36:22,088 --> 01:36:23,926
He gave Minister Rs.1 billion..

1020
01:36:25,481 --> 01:36:27,719
Big Brother Kuldev! How are you?

1021
01:36:33,243 --> 01:36:36,243
AMRUTH SHAH, President of
Pharmaceutical Association of India.

1022
01:36:40,478 --> 01:36:41,808
Why did you call me here?

1023
01:36:42,409 --> 01:36:46,917
I want you to forget the
generic medicine project.

1024
01:36:49,857 --> 01:36:53,414
Listen to me, company
is giving me shares..

1025
01:36:53,494 --> 01:36:55,868
If you want, I can
make you rich too!

1026
01:36:55,986 --> 01:36:58,908
Hey! You're second grade fail
then also people voted for you..

1027
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:00,742
..and gave you the post..

1028
01:37:00,778 --> 01:37:04,268
And you don't even care a
bit about those people?

1029
01:37:04,350 --> 01:37:07,042
Sir, you're getting me wrong.

1030
01:37:07,247 --> 01:37:10,488
I'm not doing this Generic
medicine project for money.

1031
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:12,331
I'm doing it for
welfare of people.

1032
01:37:12,405 --> 01:37:15,913
There's nothing in this world
which can't be bought.

1033
01:37:15,983 --> 01:37:17,834
Everything has a price.

1034
01:37:18,413 --> 01:37:20,444
What's your price?

1035
01:37:21,016 --> 01:37:25,315
It would be better to reduce the
cost of medicines than bribing me.

1036
01:37:25,395 --> 01:37:26,976
People would bless you.

1037
01:37:28,767 --> 01:37:31,861
Most of the Indians
believe in family values.

1038
01:37:31,872 --> 01:37:34,360
Now a days, it's
slowly decreasing.

1039
01:37:34,424 --> 01:37:37,511
When parents get old,
children leave them.

1040
01:37:37,591 --> 01:37:39,985
Brothers have disputes.
They get separated.

1041
01:37:40,065 --> 01:37:46,872
There was no love in life, if love is
there, there is no money for treatment.

1042
01:37:47,656 --> 01:37:52,642
Today's condition is so bad that people
want to die quickly than slowly.

1043
01:37:52,722 --> 01:37:56,945
They think it's better to save the
money spent on their treatment.

1044
01:37:56,990 --> 01:38:02,823
Great observation. People will surely
get a benefit. But what will you get?

1045
01:38:02,921 --> 01:38:07,360
I'll get the satisfaction
of doing a good deed.

1046
01:38:07,363 --> 01:38:10,893
Honest people like you are
begging on the streets today.

1047
01:38:10,971 --> 01:38:12,879
Reconsider.

1048
01:38:12,954 --> 01:38:16,107
One reconsiders when
he does a wrong thing.

1049
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:19,280
It takes no reconsideration
to do the right.

1050
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,641
I've studied on the street and become a
doctor and an Administrative officer.

1051
01:38:22,664 --> 01:38:25,872
I won't back away without protests
on the same street again.

1052
01:38:25,952 --> 01:38:29,213
I will make you accept the
generic medicine project.

1053
01:38:29,293 --> 01:38:32,465
You will regret putting
this deal down!

1054
01:38:32,537 --> 01:38:35,872
Whatever be the consequences,
I'm ready to face it.

1055
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:38,153
Okay. Good enough.

1056
01:38:38,233 --> 01:38:39,212
Bye.

1057
01:38:44,208 --> 01:38:45,807
Sir, there's a bad news.

1058
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:50,121
Someone along with IAS Satyamurthy
is conspiring against us.

1059
01:38:50,201 --> 01:38:53,067
We have to do something, Sir.

1060
01:38:54,466 --> 01:38:58,087
When your brother tried
to destroy our empire..

1061
01:38:58,314 --> 01:39:01,579
we bailed the
corporator to kill him!

1062
01:39:01,659 --> 01:39:05,738
And then everything
happened as per our plan.

1063
01:39:07,059 --> 01:39:08,756
Wait!

1064
01:39:08,951 --> 01:39:10,611
Sir? Sir!

1065
01:39:10,627 --> 01:39:12,249
Hey, wait!

1066
01:39:27,115 --> 01:39:30,161
After your brother
was sent to jail..

1067
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:33,091
we thought he would
forget this out of shame.

1068
01:39:33,405 --> 01:39:39,059
But it didn't happen that way. So at the
night of the day he was bailed out..

1069
01:39:49,006 --> 01:39:52,276
How are you, collector? Oh!

1070
01:39:53,304 --> 01:39:55,434
You're not a collector anymore!

1071
01:39:55,514 --> 01:40:00,374
Satyamurthy, have you called
to get your job back?

1072
01:40:01,237 --> 01:40:06,552
You can only snatch my job with your
wit and power, but not my degree.

1073
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,532
This is the power of education.

1074
01:40:08,618 --> 01:40:12,369
Don't think that it's all over.
The project will be executed!

1075
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:17,592
Calm down! There's no
need to get so excited!

1076
01:40:18,275 --> 01:40:23,152
We placed false case against you to
stop you from completing the project.

1077
01:40:23,637 --> 01:40:28,557
I made you get arrested, fired you
from your job and embarrassed you.

1078
01:40:28,637 --> 01:40:32,055
Now stop being so
stubborn, Satyamurthy!

1079
01:40:32,135 --> 01:40:36,954
Listen, this is our area. Our
power is exercised here.

1080
01:40:37,034 --> 01:40:40,501
Area might be yours
but the law isn't.

1081
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:42,451
Who are you to embarrass me?

1082
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:46,403
Just wait and watch. I'll pull you
in court and strip you naked.

1083
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:53,126
Satyamurthy, court wants evidence!
Not your stupid lecture!

1084
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,156
That's why I called you.

1085
01:40:55,226 --> 01:40:56,679
What do you mean?

1086
01:40:57,514 --> 01:41:02,885
Do you think I called you for weather news?
Everything is being recorded.

1087
01:41:06,048 --> 01:41:09,333
There's no point in being
silent now, Minister.

1088
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:12,676
- Shut up!
- The call has already been recorded.

1089
01:41:12,729 --> 01:41:13,535
Get lost!

1090
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:15,536
I have got so many
evidences for the court.

1091
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:16,557
You go inside!

1092
01:41:16,582 --> 01:41:19,601
Your speech is recorded.Let
us meet in the court.

1093
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:28,372
Then it was decided
to end your brother.

1094
01:41:45,487 --> 01:41:51,619
Who said that you have become old?
Just have a look at this first.

1095
01:41:56,122 --> 01:42:02,384
If you give me your project's documents
and hard disk data, I'll leave.

1096
01:42:02,727 --> 01:42:08,698
If you delay even a minute, your
wife and daughter are finished.

1097
01:42:14,570 --> 01:42:16,689
You have just given me
one terabyte data..

1098
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:19,592
But what about the 100
terabyte data in your mind?

1099
01:42:19,651 --> 01:42:21,359
I'll have to crash
it too, right?

1100
01:42:38,261 --> 01:42:43,511
The generic medicine project
ends with your death.

1101
01:42:43,813 --> 01:42:48,025
The man might die,
but the truth won't.

1102
01:42:49,807 --> 01:42:52,824
It's just the beginning.

1103
01:42:54,875 --> 01:42:58,602
Beginning of your end.My son
"Ram" will come to you!

1104
01:43:53,196 --> 01:43:54,148
Sister-in-law?

1105
01:43:58,669 --> 01:44:02,466
People work hard to
improve their life..

1106
01:44:02,546 --> 01:44:06,277
..but your brother gave
up his life for them!

1107
01:44:07,533 --> 01:44:11,074
He never harmed anyone in his life.
And they..

1108
01:44:12,413 --> 01:44:14,021
They killed him!

1109
01:44:15,941 --> 01:44:17,131
Ram!

1110
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:20,414
What did you do? Are you crazy?

1111
01:44:20,779 --> 01:44:22,539
Just a minute..

1112
01:44:24,887 --> 01:44:26,928
It's bleeding.

1113
01:44:29,239 --> 01:44:31,555
I'll get the bandage.

1114
01:44:34,888 --> 01:44:36,753
Ram?

1115
01:44:40,128 --> 01:44:43,276
I can understand what
you are going through..

1116
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:46,531
..but by punishing those
people and taking revenge..

1117
01:44:46,611 --> 01:44:50,163
..your brother won't
come back, will he?

1118
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:52,963
Sister-in-law, two days are
very important in life..

1119
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:56,546
One when we are born, and the other
when we find out our life's aim.

1120
01:44:56,624 --> 01:44:59,704
Today, I promise you..

1121
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:03,764
I won't let my brother's
work go waste.

1122
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:07,810
You are right. He won't come back
even if I take revenge on them.

1123
01:45:08,177 --> 01:45:13,182
But I'm not such a good human
that I'll forgive them.

1124
01:45:38,907 --> 01:45:41,927
Firstly, I'm here to see
the fear in your eyes.

1125
01:45:42,007 --> 01:45:46,621
Secondly, to show you
the trailer of death.

1126
01:45:46,753 --> 01:45:50,414
You made two big mistakes.
Firstly, betraying your country..

1127
01:45:50,494 --> 01:45:55,124
And secondly, murdering my brother.
You'll get punished for both!

1128
01:45:55,207 --> 01:46:00,639
You might have killed my brother, but
his dream. And I will finish it.

1129
01:46:00,650 --> 01:46:01,733
What will you do?

1130
01:46:01,782 --> 01:46:08,119
You should have figured what I can
do when your brother went missing.

1131
01:46:11,396 --> 01:46:16,869
You have messed with a soldier who
fights on the border for his country!

1132
01:46:16,949 --> 01:46:19,120
No matter how good
the enemy is..

1133
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,716
..he doesn't hesitate for
a moment to shoot him.

1134
01:46:21,796 --> 01:46:24,436
Nor he pities anyone.

1135
01:46:24,516 --> 01:46:29,886
You are the traitors of our land!
You have betrayed it!

1136
01:46:31,157 --> 01:46:36,140
You had enough fun, but your
death will be a horrible one.

1137
01:46:36,373 --> 01:46:39,465
So horrible that your
soul will shiver!

1138
01:46:40,921 --> 01:46:43,195
Your soul will shiver with fear!

1139
01:47:01,004 --> 01:47:02,087
Yes, Ram.

1140
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:06,338
Sir, I found out who
killed my brother and why.

1141
01:47:21,875 --> 01:47:24,562
See, I can understand
your feelings.

1142
01:47:24,646 --> 01:47:27,232
And I know what
you're capable of.

1143
01:47:27,308 --> 01:47:31,113
Just don't take a wrong
step in a hurry.We're with you.

1144
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:34,133
Take care of yourself.

1145
01:47:34,457 --> 01:47:36,503
Okay.

1146
01:48:41,127 --> 01:48:43,127
Happy birthday RAAM.

1147
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,879
Surprise!

1148
01:48:46,176 --> 01:48:48,217
Happy birthday, Ram!

1149
01:48:50,811 --> 01:48:52,244
Thanks.

1150
01:49:00,354 --> 01:49:02,232
Happy birthday, brother.

1151
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:06,390
Oh, is it his birthday too?

1152
01:49:07,498 --> 01:49:10,687
I don't know when he was born.

1153
01:49:10,738 --> 01:49:13,468
He always celebrated my
birthday along with me.

1154
01:49:13,548 --> 01:49:15,387
Oh..

1155
01:49:15,467 --> 01:49:16,887
I don't want to come.

1156
01:49:17,103 --> 01:49:19,752
Why? Stop being so stubborn.

1157
01:49:20,076 --> 01:49:22,319
- Just come and cut the cake!
- Let's go.

1158
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:28,191
If not for you, just cut the cake
for those who have come today.

1159
01:49:28,224 --> 01:49:31,237
Look, I don't know
when I was born.

1160
01:49:31,562 --> 01:49:34,930
I always celebrate my
birthday with my brother.

1161
01:49:34,982 --> 01:49:37,648
He's absent, that's why
I won't celebrate.

1162
01:49:37,728 --> 01:49:39,034
What happened?

1163
01:49:45,176 --> 01:49:46,649
Hello, Sister-in-law!

1164
01:49:46,729 --> 01:49:48,905
- Looking nice!
- Hi, uncle!

1165
01:49:48,985 --> 01:49:51,811
Hey! How are you?

1166
01:49:51,891 --> 01:49:53,365
I'm fine!

1167
01:49:54,114 --> 01:49:58,067
Ram, you said you won't come.
How all of a sudden?

1168
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:00,321
- Why? Can't I come?
- It's good that you came.

1169
01:50:00,401 --> 01:50:03,103
- He said he won't celebrate without you.
- Who?

1170
01:50:03,186 --> 01:50:05,612
Your brother, who else.
He's being stubborn.

1171
01:50:05,692 --> 01:50:08,233
I'm here, so he
will come as well.

1172
01:50:08,313 --> 01:50:10,976
No chance. Just look
around for a second.

1173
01:50:11,056 --> 01:50:12,314
Ram!

1174
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:16,057
I told you!

1175
01:50:16,286 --> 01:50:21,487
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

1176
01:50:21,567 --> 01:50:24,638
- Happy birthday, dear brother!
- Happy birthday, dear brother!

1177
01:50:25,774 --> 01:50:27,396
Stay blessed.

1178
01:50:30,285 --> 01:50:33,816
Happy birthday to you!

1179
01:50:37,431 --> 01:50:41,012
Tasty! Enough. I'm full.

1180
01:50:43,191 --> 01:50:45,546
Aren't you full yet?

1181
01:50:53,225 --> 01:50:54,522
Oh, I forgot! I'm full too.

1182
01:50:55,614 --> 01:50:58,349
Are you two up to something?

1183
01:50:58,429 --> 01:51:00,741
- Yes. - What?
- No.

1184
01:51:04,523 --> 01:51:06,577
Shut up. I'll handle it.
Don't worry.

1185
01:51:07,031 --> 01:51:08,080
I'm full too.

1186
01:51:08,725 --> 01:51:10,844
Your sister made you
food with utter love.

1187
01:51:10,924 --> 01:51:12,536
Have as much as you
want and go to sleep.

1188
01:51:12,616 --> 01:51:16,534
You are over-acting from the
time your brother came.

1189
01:51:16,612 --> 01:51:18,893
No, nothing like that.

1190
01:51:18,973 --> 01:51:19,834
I'll be back.

1191
01:51:19,914 --> 01:51:20,796
- Hey!
- Hey!

1192
01:51:20,876 --> 01:51:24,439
My brother came back after so long!
I have so much to tell him.

1193
01:51:24,519 --> 01:51:28,228
- Why did you trap me and left me alone?
- You sit.

1194
01:51:28,385 --> 01:51:30,677
- I don't eat so much sweet.
- Eat it.

1195
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:34,444
They left me here! I
won't spare them!

1196
01:55:20,304 --> 01:55:23,255
Brother always considered
me a part of him.

1197
01:55:23,687 --> 01:55:25,547
He was always with me

1198
01:55:35,049 --> 01:55:37,298
- Yes?
- What happened?

1199
01:55:38,941 --> 01:55:39,806
Sister-in-law!

1200
01:55:41,686 --> 01:55:42,757
Sister-in-law!

1201
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:45,351
- Ram!
- What happened?

1202
01:55:45,925 --> 01:55:46,985
Those people..

1203
01:55:47,065 --> 01:55:48,671
- They..
- Sister-in-law, tell me what happened!

1204
01:55:48,973 --> 01:55:51,622
- Ritu!
- Ritu?

1205
01:56:18,476 --> 01:56:19,860
Did you get it?

1206
01:56:19,884 --> 01:56:21,092
Sorry.

1207
01:56:21,481 --> 01:56:24,281
We don't want to
kill your daughter.

1208
01:56:24,768 --> 01:56:26,491
We like kids too.

1209
01:56:26,518 --> 01:56:29,527
But we love our life
more than that.

1210
01:56:29,654 --> 01:56:33,584
She's a fatherless girl,
please leave her alone.

1211
01:56:33,601 --> 01:56:38,028
She should also understand
why her father died.

1212
01:56:38,547 --> 01:56:42,461
It will be better if
you do what we say.

1213
01:56:43,963 --> 01:56:47,365
Else your daughter
will be killed.

1214
01:56:48,104 --> 01:56:50,674
Tell me, what do I have to do?

1215
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:52,847
Good. You're smart.

1216
01:56:52,858 --> 01:56:54,328
But your husband was foolish.

1217
01:56:54,408 --> 01:56:57,907
Our car will come to
your house in an hour.

1218
01:56:57,987 --> 01:57:02,169
Tell Ram to sit in the car
with all the evidences.

1219
01:57:03,059 --> 01:57:08,497
Your husband committed suicide, and your
brother-in-law should have an accident.

1220
01:57:08,577 --> 01:57:12,281
The one who was to die a
martyr for his country..

1221
01:57:12,302 --> 01:57:15,394
will be killed on the road!

1222
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:18,583
We made arrangements
to catch the tiger.

1223
01:57:18,866 --> 01:57:21,120
The moment he is caught..

1224
01:57:21,202 --> 01:57:25,723
your daughter will be sent home.

1225
01:57:30,943 --> 01:57:33,038
Ritu will come back.

1226
01:57:44,418 --> 01:57:47,218
Ram! If you go..

1227
01:57:47,715 --> 01:57:50,310
there will be..

1228
01:57:50,386 --> 01:57:53,299
no hope of you returning.

1229
01:58:01,336 --> 01:58:04,373
Sister-in-law, when one goes
to work he might return.

1230
01:58:05,834 --> 01:58:12,290
But when a soldier goes to work,
there's no hope of him returning.

1231
01:58:12,872 --> 01:58:16,301
Anything can happen
to him any time.

1232
01:58:16,547 --> 01:58:19,860
There's no idea when he dies.

1233
01:58:22,277 --> 01:58:27,401
When a person becomes a soldier, he's
ready to give his life for the nation.

1234
01:58:27,878 --> 01:58:33,351
If we can give up our life
for our nation's security..

1235
01:58:36,162 --> 01:58:39,819
can't I give up my life
for my family's security?

1236
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:47,854
Every soldier, faces his enemy on
the battleground with courage.

1237
01:58:49,605 --> 01:58:53,178
The one stands by his family,
is a courageous soldier.

1238
01:58:56,270 --> 01:59:00,713
We're soldiers. Wherever we
are, in whatever condition..

1239
01:59:01,162 --> 01:59:05,254
we always wish for
our family's safety.

1240
01:59:07,094 --> 01:59:10,359
Ritu will certainly come back.

1241
01:59:11,278 --> 01:59:14,605
When she comes back,
give her this.

1242
01:59:14,630 --> 01:59:19,068
No matter how strong the enemy is,
our nation will overpower it.

1243
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:22,494
I have full faith.

1244
01:59:22,921 --> 01:59:28,732
When Ritu grows up, she
will make our nation proud!

1245
02:00:11,925 --> 02:00:14,492
Greetings, Captain Ram.

1246
02:00:15,532 --> 02:00:20,424
Won't you talk about patriotism
or nationalism today?

1247
02:00:20,504 --> 02:00:26,978
Why are you quiet? Patriotism fell
short against family, didn't it?

1248
02:00:27,018 --> 02:00:30,039
I thought you would
come like a tiger..

1249
02:00:30,119 --> 02:00:34,991
..but you are standing in
front of me like a jackal.

1250
02:00:35,841 --> 02:00:38,260
Do you know what I
feel like saying?

1251
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:40,557
Salute to your master!

1252
02:00:40,637 --> 02:00:42,747
Calls himself a patriot!

1253
02:00:43,075 --> 02:00:46,600
You're a politician, and you don't
know anything more about a soldier.

1254
02:00:46,633 --> 02:00:50,052
It's not your mistake. But
of those who elected you.

1255
02:00:50,132 --> 02:00:55,106
Stop your nonsense. People gave
me votes, and I won as well.

1256
02:00:56,024 --> 02:00:59,500
Listen to me carefully.

1257
02:01:00,278 --> 02:01:04,359
You will sit in that car,
have an accident and..

1258
02:01:04,643 --> 02:01:11,764
With that, you, your evidence and your
brother's project will go up in flames!

1259
02:01:11,859 --> 02:01:14,076
Hail the Lord!

1260
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:20,587
- Mr. Ram.
- Yeah?

1261
02:01:21,057 --> 02:01:23,658
We have an arrest warrant against you.
Please cooperate.

1262
02:01:23,738 --> 02:01:27,425
We don't want to use any kind of force.
Please come with us.

1263
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:31,409
We have got orders to arrest you and
take you to them. Come with us.

1264
02:01:31,489 --> 02:01:32,619
I need to talk for a minute.

1265
02:01:32,699 --> 02:01:33,408
Okay.

1266
02:01:33,488 --> 02:01:34,754
Thank you.

1267
02:01:40,264 --> 02:01:42,413
Don't even touch Ritu.

1268
02:01:44,615 --> 02:01:46,746
Why did he say so?

1269
02:01:51,075 --> 02:01:53,400
What happened? Has
the plan changed?

1270
02:01:53,494 --> 02:01:55,178
No. Did you reach
there to get him?

1271
02:01:55,258 --> 02:01:56,628
That's why I'm here!

1272
02:01:56,708 --> 02:01:59,761
But police came and took him away
saying he has court martial..

1273
02:01:59,841 --> 02:02:02,512
..they are handing him over to the army!
What's all this?

1274
02:02:02,962 --> 02:02:04,352
I don't know.

1275
02:02:04,432 --> 02:02:08,242
One thing's for sure.
Till we have the girl..

1276
02:02:08,601 --> 02:02:10,885
..he'll have to come.

1277
02:02:34,809 --> 02:02:36,777
- Sir..
- If there's any emergency..

1278
02:02:36,857 --> 02:02:38,338
..it's our duty to save her.

1279
02:02:38,647 --> 02:02:41,199
Your niece is the
citizen of our country.

1280
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:42,784
It's our duty to save her.

1281
02:02:42,843 --> 02:02:43,421
Thank you, Sir.

1282
02:02:43,654 --> 02:02:44,851
- Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

1283
02:02:45,296 --> 02:02:47,268
Sir, people from your
regiment will take over.

1284
02:02:47,348 --> 02:02:48,431
Thank you.

1285
02:02:48,532 --> 02:02:50,736
He called the minister
after your arrest.

1286
02:02:50,816 --> 02:02:53,044
- Location?
- I think it was here.

1287
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:56,160
This tower is near
the Avenue Road.

1288
02:02:56,411 --> 02:02:58,867
He'll call again. Be alert.

1289
02:03:00,362 --> 02:03:02,265
Sir, he's calling him again.

1290
02:03:02,983 --> 02:03:03,841
Location?

1291
02:03:03,869 --> 02:03:05,867
I think near Avenue Road.

1292
02:03:06,132 --> 02:03:08,175
We are tracking
his GPS location.

1293
02:03:08,255 --> 02:03:09,516
Start tracking the number.

1294
02:03:09,564 --> 02:03:11,588
Pass this information
to the Home Minister.

1295
02:03:11,668 --> 02:03:12,800
Yes, Sir.

1296
02:03:34,446 --> 02:03:35,536
Hello?

1297
02:03:36,169 --> 02:03:39,466
Don't call now,
someone might notice.

1298
02:03:41,892 --> 02:03:45,153
Get a towel for the girl too.

1299
02:03:51,308 --> 02:03:52,991
Are you blind?

1300
02:03:53,071 --> 02:03:53,760
Here.

1301
02:03:54,037 --> 02:03:55,360
Everything fell!

1302
02:04:09,899 --> 02:04:11,265
"Hebbuli!"

1303
02:04:13,211 --> 02:04:15,148
"Hebbuli!"

1304
02:04:27,928 --> 02:04:30,357
Where's Ritu? Tell me!

1305
02:04:37,038 --> 02:04:41,354
Hello, do you think you're the
only intelligent in this world?

1306
02:04:41,434 --> 02:04:45,730
I drink the juice of intelligence
every morning, get it?

1307
02:04:45,774 --> 02:04:49,839
I trapped you in your own
plan, did you get it?

1308
02:04:49,919 --> 02:04:53,674
This is called
politics, my patriot.

1309
02:04:54,050 --> 02:04:58,314
You know what you've to do next.

1310
02:04:59,879 --> 02:05:02,068
Come.

1311
02:05:12,669 --> 02:05:15,046
Don't hit me!

1312
02:05:44,344 --> 02:05:45,564
Come!

1313
02:05:51,219 --> 02:05:53,268
Brother!

1314
02:06:25,077 --> 02:06:29,592
You also proved today that there's
no one more faithful than dogs.

1315
02:06:30,336 --> 02:06:32,986
My secret has been opened..

1316
02:06:33,076 --> 02:06:35,793
so you'll have to be closed.

1317
02:06:35,801 --> 02:06:37,135
Sorry.

1318
02:06:47,284 --> 02:06:53,565
I always told him to obey
the elders, but see..

1319
02:06:53,645 --> 02:06:55,728
Hail the Lord!

1320
02:07:03,430 --> 02:07:06,254
I got all the documents with
me, just like you said.

1321
02:07:06,262 --> 02:07:09,293
Now according to your
promise, let Ritu go.

1322
02:07:10,226 --> 02:07:13,477
I can understand the pain of
losing someone from the family.

1323
02:07:14,053 --> 02:07:16,780
Kill me, but let her go.

1324
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:52,279
I won't kill you so easily!

1325
02:07:52,316 --> 02:07:56,046
You dared to interfere
in my business, right?

1326
02:07:56,370 --> 02:07:57,981
How dare you!

1327
02:07:58,651 --> 02:08:02,035
My future plans have already
spoiled because of you..

1328
02:08:02,295 --> 02:08:06,389
and you're looming
here as Death!

1329
02:08:08,338 --> 02:08:12,867
You troubled so much. Now you'll
understand who you messed with!

1330
02:08:13,515 --> 02:08:14,845
Here!

1331
02:08:25,041 --> 02:08:28,965
Your brother was an Administrative officer
and you're an Army Officer, right?

1332
02:08:30,573 --> 02:08:34,509
You could've lived your life
like a normal person, but no..

1333
02:08:34,589 --> 02:08:39,938
Both of the brothers were so
interested to become patriots!

1334
02:08:47,069 --> 02:08:52,740
You can show your strength
only on the border, not here.

1335
02:09:10,871 --> 02:09:14,528
If the poor die due to
diseases, let them die!

1336
02:09:14,623 --> 02:09:16,882
What will you do if
they remain alive?

1337
02:09:16,962 --> 02:09:21,131
Hey! People protest when
grocery's prices rise..

1338
02:09:21,211 --> 02:09:24,950
and they protest when
diesel's prices rise!

1339
02:09:24,980 --> 02:09:29,653
But do they protest when medicines
prices rise? No, right?

1340
02:09:29,677 --> 02:09:34,027
Because they're afraid of death!

1341
02:09:40,075 --> 02:09:44,183
The fear which is their weakness,
we exploit that in our business.

1342
02:09:44,507 --> 02:09:46,842
Generic medicine!

1343
02:09:46,918 --> 02:09:51,464
This was your brother's dream, right?
Now it has shattered.

1344
02:09:51,556 --> 02:09:54,321
Now it is impossible to fulfil.

1345
02:09:54,378 --> 02:10:00,676
Because this is my strategy
and no one can outsmart it!

1346
02:10:09,613 --> 02:10:12,879
Hey, tiger, you've turned
into a helpless cat!

1347
02:10:12,959 --> 02:10:16,414
Not angry yet? Want
me to feed you some?

1348
02:10:17,581 --> 02:10:21,651
We planned your
brother's murder!

1349
02:10:22,381 --> 02:10:27,971
We are the ones who killed
him as if it were a suicide!

1350
02:10:28,522 --> 02:10:32,349
Aren't you angry? Why
don't you get angry?

1351
02:10:33,203 --> 02:10:36,157
You can kill me if you want..

1352
02:10:36,208 --> 02:10:39,276
but let the the girl Ritu go.

1353
02:10:40,773 --> 02:10:43,455
I thought you were a tiger.

1354
02:10:43,535 --> 02:10:48,416
But you turned out to be a rat. Listen,
let him go! He's already dead.

1355
02:10:48,496 --> 02:10:51,876
What are you looking at?
End him!

1356
02:11:21,054 --> 02:11:24,049
Exhaust all the
ammunition on him!

1357
02:11:24,129 --> 02:11:27,303
He's no ordinary
man, but a tiger!

1358
02:11:27,383 --> 02:11:29,705
Ferocious tiger!

1359
02:11:59,248 --> 02:12:02,729
Oh no! I was right!

1360
02:12:29,658 --> 02:12:33,031
If a tiger is silent, it
doesn't mean he is tired.

1361
02:12:33,111 --> 02:12:36,666
That means he is
planning his attack.

1362
02:12:36,857 --> 02:12:40,133
I wanted your attention for
fifteen minutes. You know why?

1363
02:12:40,213 --> 02:12:44,471
I wanted to reveal your truth,
which the entire world just saw.

1364
02:12:45,031 --> 02:12:47,744
I was just faking it.

1365
02:12:59,849 --> 02:13:04,173
I want you to listen to something.
Listen carefully.

1366
02:13:06,055 --> 02:13:11,555
We soldiers give up our lives on the
border for your family's safety.

1367
02:13:11,839 --> 02:13:15,439
Whoever dares to
trouble our family..

1368
02:13:20,552 --> 02:13:25,558
You told that my niece was in your
possession. Just check it once.

1369
02:13:26,812 --> 02:13:30,693
No one's picking up, right?
No one will.

1370
02:13:47,196 --> 02:13:49,992
When a country's
soldier gets angry..

1371
02:13:50,072 --> 02:13:53,799
..he beats the country's
traitors into pieces!

1372
02:13:54,821 --> 02:13:59,481
You got help only to
carry out the project..

1373
02:14:00,768 --> 02:14:04,168
not to trouble people!

1374
02:14:39,454 --> 02:14:42,373
There's only one answer for you!

1375
02:14:45,865 --> 02:14:49,519
People try to save
each other's lives!

1376
02:14:49,822 --> 02:14:56,927
And you have established this as
an illegal medicine business!

1377
02:15:33,057 --> 02:15:36,719
