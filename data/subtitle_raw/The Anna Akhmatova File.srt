1
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:10,389
When in the night hour I await her coming

2
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:14,673
it seems to me my life hangs by the thread.

3
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:20,556
Youth, honours, liberty -

4
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:24,322
all shrink to nothing when my dear visitor pipes my bed.

5
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:29,343
Look, here she comes, her veil she raises,

6
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:32,910
turning to view me with a shrewd appraising eye.

7
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,493
"Pray, was it you who dictated the Inferno to Dante?".

8
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:43,020
And she answers: "It was I."

9
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:08,055
Stalin: And how's Akhmatova?

10
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:11,976
Prokofiev: She is too old, she cannot be reformed.

11
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:16,179
And Znamya publishes what we've rejected...

12
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,095
Stalin: We'll reach them too.

13
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:21,946
("Izvestia" May 21, 1988)

14
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:37,184
Anna Akhmatova's File

15
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:41,372
Note:

16
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:45,280
Detailed replies must be given.

17
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,370
Underlining is not allowed.

18
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,272
Write only in ink.

19
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:02,251
I was born in the same year as Charlie Chaplin,

20
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:05,488
the "Kreutzer Sonata" by Leo Tolstoi

21
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:08,597
and the Eiffel Tower...

22
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:12,764
My father was a retired naval engineer.

23
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:18,701
I was named after my grandmother Anna Motovilova.

24
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:25,252
I was born at our country house near Odessa.

25
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:27,967
When I was 15

26
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:32,987
I was once passing by that place with my mother.

27
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:35,253
We looked at it and I said:

28
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:40,668
"Am memorial plaque will be put up here one day."

29
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:45,394
It was a silly joke and Mother got upset:

30
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:49,106
"I've brought you up badly!"

31
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:55,340
When I was one year old I was taken to the North,

32
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,120
to Tsarskoe Selo where I lived till I was 16.

33
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,961
In 1905 my parents separated.

34
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:07,462
Mother took the children to the South.

35
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:12,019
I missed Tsarskoe Selo

36
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:16,963
and wrote a great deal of not my best poetry.

37
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:12,224
Papa said about my poetry:
"Don't put my name to shame."

38
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:17,145
"I don't need your name", I replied.

39
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:26,244
Only a crazy girl could chose a Tartar name
for a Russian poetess.

40
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:33,176
I've decided to tell you about an event

41
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:38,090
which must surely change my entire life.

42
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,231
I've decided to marry the friend of my youth,

43
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:44,971
Nikolai Stepanovich Gumilyov.

44
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:49,160
He's already been in love with me for 3 years.

45
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:53,149
I believe that to be his wife is my fate.

46
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:58,689
I swear with all that is sacred to me

47
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:03,293
that this unhappy man will be happy with me.

48
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:25,023
I sat near the window and read Annensky.

49
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:29,930
Suddenly I understood what I must do.

50
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,124
When Gumilyov was back from Abyssinia

51
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:41,050
I'd already written a few poems
that were later included in the book "Evening".

52
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:47,265
Gumilyov was serious about my work.
He wanted me to go on.

53
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:06,095
Early in 1912 the first book of my poems was published.

54
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:12,053
On October 1st my son Lev was born,

55
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:17,505
my only son.

56
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:29,375
Mother, dear,

57
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,183
I'm sorry we were not allowed to meet.

58
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:38,210
The things you've sent are not needed.

59
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,016
Let those who sent me to prison feed and dress me.

60
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:49,599
The 20th anniversary of the VCHKa and the NKVD

61
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,842
is not simply an anniversary of the of the Soviet offices.

62
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:57,379
This office stands closer than any other office to the Party.

63
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:02,505
It's more loyal that any other to Party principles.

64
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:17,897
Comrade Stalin has given us an example
of the Soviet worker of Lenin's type.

65
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:25,683
And Comrade Stalin is Lenin's true disciple.

66
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:32,089
This is why the worker of Lenin's type
is also a worker of Stalin's type.

67
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:07,156
Allow me to wish the NKVD workers
to be like Lenin and Stalin,

68
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:12,981
and to do the lofty tasks set out before them,

69
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:18,446
to be courageous in battles
and fierce towards the enemies,

70
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:23,982
not to forget what Stalin once said:

71
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:28,709
"The more gains we have,
the more attempts the enemy makes

72
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:33,350
to attack and undermine us."

73
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:40,188
We hope that the NKVD officers

74
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:45,013
will work as well as Lenin did
and Stalin does.

75
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,067
Dearest Mother!

76
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:54,433
I was acquitted of all charges brought against me,
despite all reports on me.

77
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,677
I'm well and not even sad.

78
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:04,766
I only feel sorry for my unfinished works,

79
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,812
but they don't seem to be topical.

80
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:41,444
I pray not for myself alone,

81
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:46,248
But for everyone who stood with me.

82
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:51,562
In summer's heat and winter's chill

83
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:56,110
Beneath that red, unseeing wall.

84
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,623
What all of us have lived through,

85
00:17:03,904 --> 00:17:08,658
all of us, because imprisonment threatened all,

86
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:12,298
no literature could describe.

87
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:18,991
Shakespearean dramas
with their passions and duels, villainous acts,

88
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:24,715
are children's games
compared to the life of any of us.

89
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:29,550
What the executed or camp inmates have lived through

90
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,543
I cannot tell,
because you cannot describe this in words.

91
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:39,827
But even our prosperous life

92
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:44,477
is a Shakespearean drama
multiplied a thousand times.

93
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:50,695
Silent departures,
sinister news in every family,

94
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:58,836
black mourning frocks
worn by mothers and wives.

95
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:46,353
In December 1913 I brought Blok his books
to have them autographed.

96
00:18:47,614 --> 00:18:50,969
He wrote a simple inscription:
"To Akhmatova from Blok".

97
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:55,767
and in the 3rd volume:
"Beauty is menacing!

98
00:18:55,767 --> 00:19:02,777
"You'll throw lazily the Spanish shawl around your shoulders."

99
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:10,557
I've never had a Spanish shawl,
but Blok was crazy about Carmen at the time

100
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:12,955
and saw a Spaniard in me.

101
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,253
The three of us, Blok, Gumilyov and I,

102
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:34,600
were having dinner at the Tsarskoe Selo station
at the beginning of the war.

103
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:38,267
Gumilyov was in uniform.

104
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:41,509
He told me:

105
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:46,733
"If they send Blok to the front

106
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:50,684
it would be the same
as roasting nightingales."

107
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:14,121
On August 7, 1921 Blok died in horrible agony.

108
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:19,764
On August 24 of the same year
Gumilyov was shot.

109
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,171
Alexander Blok was 40.

110
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:26,753
Nikolai Gumilyov 35.

111
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:28,763
His fame came too late.

112
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:34,506
He was at its threshold,
but had no time to know it.

113
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:40,600
Blok knew fame for 10 years.

114
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,895
Alexander Blok.
Died on August 7, 1921.

115
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,322
I knew about Nikolai:
he was shot.

116
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:58,102
My friends had laundress.
Her daughter was an investigator.

117
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:04,311
The laundress told them all
and about the place.

118
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:09,441
My friends saw there
the ground trampled down by boots.

119
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:18,191
I found out about it 9 years later
and went there.

120
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:21,006
I saw a clearing, a crooked pine tree.

121
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:27,036
The ground had sunk
because the graves were not made properly.

122
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:50,156
When I came
white flowers were growing around.

123
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,731
I was picking them and thinking:

124
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:56,751
"People bring flowers to the grave

125
00:21:58,207 --> 00:22:00,997
"and I pick them."

126
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,358
He wasn't handsome, squinted
and had a speech defect.

127
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:12,143
A traveller, a brave soldier.

128
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:16,135
He was decorated with two St. George's crosses.

129
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:21,485
He bore all his trials simply
and even cheerfully.

130
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:25,388
He was a free man, not embittered,
just a bit ironic.

131
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:30,180
He had never fawned on anyone.

132
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:39,912
All my life August has been a bad month for me.

133
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:03,693
I heard a voice. With soothing summons

134
00:23:03,693 --> 00:23:07,239
"Come hither, hither!" it implored.

135
00:23:07,439 --> 00:23:11,763
"Leave your birthplace! Leave sinful Russia

136
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:15,298
Forever! Come away abroad!

137
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:19,195
I'll render your blood-red hands snow-white,

138
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:23,079
I'll rid your heart of darkest shame,

139
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,515
The pain of outrage and surrender

140
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:29,866
I'll comfort with another name."

141
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,984
But unconcerned and calmly raising

142
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:37,740
With open palms I blocked my ears,

143
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,859
Not letting such unseemly phrases

144
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:46,283
Profane my soul in grief and tears.

145
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:58,186
Anna Akhmatova is a typical representative

146
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:04,691
of the empty poetry that lacks ideas
and is alien to our people.

147
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:12,588
What does this poetry have in common
with the interests of the people and the state?

148
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,563
Nothing.

149
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:23,624
How can Akhmatova's works
educate our young people?

150
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,779
Her poetry has a very narrow range.

151
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,445
The feeling of doom
understood only by extinct people.

152
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,215
This is Akhmatova's spiritual world,

153
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:12,992
a fragment of the world that has sunk into oblivion.

154
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:31,702
I had a difficult character in my youth.

155
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:35,555
I always upheld my independence.

156
00:25:37,171 --> 00:25:41,083
I lived 7 years with Gumilyov.

157
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:46,356
We were very friendly.
We were much obliged to each other inwardly.

158
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:50,097
But I told him that we have to part.

159
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:56,650
He didn't object,

160
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,943
but I saw he was offended.

161
00:26:40,637 --> 00:26:44,514
It's so strange that we had lived
with Punin for 16 years.

162
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:49,736
The atmosphere was burdensome,

163
00:26:49,936 --> 00:26:52,512
but I was so depressed,

164
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:57,752
I had no strength to leave.

165
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:00,217
I felt very bad.

166
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:06,265
For 13 years I hadn't been writing any poetry.

167
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,277
For 13 years.

168
00:27:15,954 --> 00:27:18,565
I visited Akhmatova yesterday on business.

169
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:24,385
I went to the garden,
climbed up the old staircase

170
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:29,630
that still bore some relation to her.
But then ...

171
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:35,436
A woman opened the door
wiping the soap suds off her hands.

172
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:40,182
I did not expect to see soap suds
and the neglected hall.

173
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:48,596
There was the wet linen
on the line in the kitchen.

174
00:27:48,796 --> 00:27:54,873
Her room was a site of neglect and ruin.

175
00:27:55,073 --> 00:28:02,650
The beautiful antique chair and the framed mirror
only stressed the squalor.

176
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,324
What was really good
was the window opening on the garden,

177
00:28:06,524 --> 00:28:10,405
and the tree.

178
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,997
And she herself, of course.

179
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:22,266
Deus consentat omnia.

180
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:25,030
God protects all.

181
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:34,404
The main feature of my biography is:

182
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:39,411
all the houses where I lived
no longer exist.

183
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:45,324
Sevastopol, Tsarskoe Selo -
I had no permanent home.

184
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:49,612
I wasn't home either
in Peter or in Moscow.

185
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:55,084
Mandelstam knowing how bad I felt
at my Fontanka house,

186
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:59,433
while saying goodbye to me
called me "Dearest Anna".

187
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:02,725
He'd never called me that before.

188
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:08,404
"Always remember - my home is your home".

189
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,007
I was praised and criticized
on many occasions,

190
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:17,130
but I'd never been seriously distressed about that.

191
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,912
I was only really upset once:

192
00:29:21,956 --> 00:29:28,226
When Osip called me in his review
"a typical lady of the parquet."

193
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:30,909
And that was because of Osip,

194
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:34,125
because it came from Osip.

195
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:40,524
If I had been his sister,

196
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:44,363
he couldn't have trusted me more.

197
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:47,522
He told me once:

198
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,646
"I've already prepared myself for death ..."

199
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:54,318
And he said:

200
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:57,670
"Verses today should be filled
with civic spirit."

201
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,825
And he read:

202
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:04,136
"We don't feel the country behind us."

203
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,993
We know the sources
that have given us Pushkin and Blok.

204
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:17,676
But who can tell where this divine harmony

205
00:30:17,876 --> 00:30:22,406
that is called Mandelstam's verses,
came from?

206
00:30:25,295 --> 00:30:28,028
Osip died when he was 47.

207
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:16,163
The Kharkov theatre, 1928.

208
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:22,719
Vladimir Mayakovsky replies
to notes from the audience.

209
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:27,213
"What is your attitude
to Akhmatova and Tsvetaeva?"

210
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:29,537
"Whom do you like more?"

211
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:33,801
After folding the note he quipped:

212
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:39,489
"Akhmatova and Tsvetaeva?
Two dames of one flock."

213
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,715
Answering about Gumilyov:

214
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:47,882
"They say: "A good poet."

215
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:51,127
"This is too short and wrong.

216
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:54,815
"He was a good counter-revolutionary poet."

217
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:04,078
I was asked to write reminiscences
about Mayakovsky.

218
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:06,191
I refused.

219
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,774
I knew him very little and only distantly.

220
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:13,174
I detest recalling distant acquaintances.

221
00:32:13,174 --> 00:32:18,351
Besides, why should I follow his chariot?

222
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:21,335
I have my own.

223
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:31,648
He's guilty neither of this nor that or the third.

224
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:36,036
In general, poets can't be sinners.

225
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:41,143
To dance around the Ark of Testament or vanish -

226
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:47,706
about that their poems told better than me.

227
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:12,751
<i>Here're they - the scouts of Japanese imperialism.

228
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:19,596
<i>Here are the agents of the War Minister and the Army

229
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:24,532
<i>amassing their forces on the borders of our country

230
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:28,976
<i>in order to attack our sacred borders.

231
00:33:28,976 --> 00:33:31,293
<i>Their plan has been exposed.

232
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:39,002
<i>The treacherous mask has been torn off their faces

233
00:33:39,202 --> 00:33:41,967
<i>once and for all!

234
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:51,821
<i>Let our verdict thunder as an edifying and purifying storm

235
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:56,021
<i>of a just Soviet punishment.

236
00:33:56,221 --> 00:33:59,432
A naked man on a barren soil.

237
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:05,493
Art is a dangerous thing.
What horrifying fates!

238
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:09,958
While young, you don't see this
and if you do you ignore it.

239
00:34:10,158 --> 00:34:15,572
Poverty has interfered neither with work nor grief.

240
00:34:16,798 --> 00:34:19,572
No, grief is not an obstacle.

241
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:35,574
<i>Here's the verdict:

242
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,579
<i>"On behalf of the Union of Soviet Socialist republics

243
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:41,085
<i>the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR

244
00:34:41,285 --> 00:34:44,461
<i>consisting of its chairman

245
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:49,009
<i>Ulrich, members of the Court,

<i>with the participation of the

<i>Public Prosecutor, Procurator of the USSR Vyshinsky ...

251
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:22,396
I saw Tsvetaeva for the first time in 1941.

252
00:35:22,596 --> 00:35:26,213
Prior to that, Marina used to send me her poems and gifts.

253
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:32,148
In 1941 I came to Moscow to handle the affairs of my son.

254
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:39,870
Pasternak visited Marina after her drama
and asked if she needed anything.

255
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,335
She said: "I want to see Akhmatova".

256
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:44,048
I phoned her.

257
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:46,156
"This is Akhmatova speaking."

258
00:35:46,356 --> 00:35:48,511
"I hear you."

259
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:53,577
That was all. Just "I hear you."

260
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:59,403
"Boris Leonidovich told me you wanted to see me."

261
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:04,554
"Where is it better for us to meet -
at your place or mine?"

262
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:13,192
"I think, at your place."

263
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:17,315
She came and stayed for 7 hours.

264
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,539
I thought she lived a happy life.

265
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:31,060
Or, maybe, it was me who was happy,
maybe, the two of us?

266
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:45,265
I was in Leningrad when the war broke out.

267
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:48,649
During the siege I left for Moscow.

268
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,335
From there I went to Chistopol
and then to Tashkent.

269
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:55,723
Akhmatova in Chistopol.

270
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,407
The light of the street lamp lit her face.
It was desperate.

271
00:38:01,398 --> 00:38:06,672
I took her by the hand
and led her towards the house.

272
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:10,824
Anna asked me about Tsvetaeva.

273
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,796
"It's strange", I said.

274
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:22,054
""The same river, the same cold day,
the puddle and the board.

275
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:26,664
" A month ago I helped Marina go across the puddle.

276
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:29,803
She asked me about Anna.

277
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:34,689
"And now there's no Marina.

278
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:37,938
"And you ask me about her

279
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:41,699
"on the same spot."

280
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:48,828
The deep has swallowed my beloved

281
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:53,305
And my parent's possessions are taken away

282
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:57,325
We're walking with you, Marina,

283
00:38:57,525 --> 00:39:01,559
Along the dark streets today.

284
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:05,287
And behind us millions are moving,

285
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:09,795
there's no other more silent flow,

286
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:14,128
with funeral bells tolling
and the whining blizzard

287
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:18,429
covering our tracks

288
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:24,284
with the freshly fallen snow.

289
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:32,330
We allowed such harmful literature
as the works  by Zoshenko and Akhmatova.

290
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:40,619
No one from our great Writers' Union
opposed anything to them.

291
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:47,067
Akhmatova has never been regarded
as a prominent poet.

292
00:39:48,827 --> 00:39:52,868
It's surprising why young people picked her up

293
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,433
and made a banner out of her.

294
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:09,895
In the morning I went to the Writers' Union
knowing nothing.

295
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:19,067
Girls were blowing their noses
and wiping their tears.

296
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:23,490
I was asked: "Will you go to the Smolny today?"

297
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,569
"No", I said, "I'm not going.
It's too hot."

298
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:32,674
On my way home I saw Misha Zoshenko
on the other side of the street.

299
00:40:32,674 --> 00:40:36,278
He rushed to me, kissed my hand and asked:

300
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:40,582
"Should we tolerate all this, Anna Andreevna?"

301
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:45,668
I knew he had some troubles at home.

302
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:50,306
I said: "Yes, you should."

303
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:10,075
The notice certifying a postal delivery

304
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:14,356
to Akhmatova.

305
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:19,070
Lefortovo Security Prison

306
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,497
Prisoner Lev Gumilov

307
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:27,822
received 200 roubles.

308
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:31,515
tea, sugar, pork fat, meat

309
00:41:31,715 --> 00:41:33,745
and 8 packets of tobacco ...

310
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:45,098
In 1949 numerous arrests were made among those
who had returned from prisons.

311
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:47,655
Lev Gumilov was among them.

312
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:52,658
Anna Andreevna had a serious heart attack.

313
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:37,849
On May 5, 1954, Zoshenko and I were summoned
urgently to the Leningrad House of Writers.

314
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:42,739
"A British student delegation wants to see you."

315
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:45,851
I said: "I'm ill."

316
00:43:46,051 --> 00:43:54,491
"No, you must come, or else
they'll say you have been dealt with too."

317
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:57,042
They sent a car for me.

318
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:00,254
I anticipated a catastrophe.

319
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:04,767
I looked into their faces
but couldn't guess who'd ask.

320
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:11,720
They asked Zoshenko's attitude
to the Decision.

321
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:20,041
He said he was first shocked
but its unjust nature,

322
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:26,127
but then he understood that many things
in that document were fair.

323
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:29,441
There was only slight applause.

324
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:31,262
I was waiting.

325
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:37,145
"And what is Madame Akhmatova's attitude
to the Decision?"

326
00:44:37,145 --> 00:44:39,465
I got up and said:

327
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:49,094
"I regard Comrade Zhdanov's speech
and the Party's Decision as correct!"

328
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:52,449
Silence followed.

329
00:45:00,953 --> 00:45:05,243
Mikhail Mikhailovich proved to be more naive
than I thought him to be.

330
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:09,643
He imagined that he could explain something to them.

331
00:45:09,843 --> 00:45:14,979
I such cases one could reply only
the way I did.

332
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:19,357
Poor Mishenka ...

333
00:45:19,557 --> 00:45:21,824
went out of his mind.

334
00:45:22,024 --> 00:45:24,139
He lost the second round.

335
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:27,700
The man was destroyed.

336
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,098
I thought sadly:
I've had a lousy life.

337
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:39,720
I don't like these ideas.

338
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:47,131
In the last 15 years I've been scared many a time.

339
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:50,672
The writer with a scared soul

340
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:55,298
is lost to literature.

341
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:10,773
They are going home.

342
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,351
Now prisoners will return

343
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:46,409
and two Russias will look at each other's face:

344
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:52,287
the one which imprisoned
and the one which was imprisoned.

345
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:56,020
A new epoch began.

346
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:01,236
We lived up to it.

347
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,447
When I was visiting Akhmatova at the Ardov's home

348
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:12,647
the door suddenly opened and a man walked it.

349
00:48:12,847 --> 00:48:15,860
"Are you acquainted?"

350
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,938
- No.
- Meet my son.

351
00:48:25,013 --> 00:48:28,824
Her sleepless nights,
meetings and no meetings,

352
00:48:29,024 --> 00:48:33,562
Little windows, dirty floors,
summons, parcels, a hair

353
00:48:33,762 --> 00:48:37,941
enclosed in a notebook of poems,
burnt poems,

354
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:43,266
the walls of this room -
all is permeated by thoughts about him,

355
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:46,851
by poems written to him.

356
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:50,141
All trees and dawns

357
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:54,013
outside her window,
scars on the muscles of her heart.

358
00:48:56,357 --> 00:48:59,363
Two decades of her life.

359
00:49:26,219 --> 00:49:28,820
The poet Boris Pasternak.

360
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:35,240
I adore this man.

361
00:49:36,303 --> 00:49:38,351
True, he's unbearable.

362
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:42,421
He came to me yesterday
to explain that he's worthless.

363
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:46,549
I told him: "My dear friend,

364
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:53,778
"even if you hadn't have written anything
for the past 10 years,

365
00:49:53,778 --> 00:49:59,946
all the same you are one of the greatest poets
of the 20th century."

366
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:06,223
I'm in a car. The young driver
turns suddenly to me and asks:

367
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:11,152
"Did you read it? One writer,
I think his name is Paster,

368
00:50:11,352 --> 00:50:16,680
"sold his book to foreign enemies
where he says that he hates the Soviet people.

369
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,301
He was paid a million $ for that.

370
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:25,500
"He eats our bread and spits on ours.
Here's the paper."

371
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,957
And he offered me the "Pravda".

372
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:33,665
What haters of people we are!

373
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:37,929
We didn't give you Pasternak's verses in time
to read and understand

374
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:46,438
so that you could treat this issue of the paper
the way it deserves to be treated.

375
00:50:49,466 --> 00:50:53,620
A real hunt is on
for the soul of an ordinary man.

376
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:03,579
Peredelkino.

377
00:51:05,887 --> 00:51:08,759
I didn't know if the news
had reached Pasternak

378
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:12,475
that he'd been expelled
from the Union the day before.

379
00:51:14,243 --> 00:51:17,587
I pushed open the gate and walked in.

380
00:51:19,147 --> 00:51:20,847
"Is Boris Leonidovich in?"

381
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:22,614
"Yes, he is."

382
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:28,011
He was coming towards me
looking at me intently.

383
00:51:28,211 --> 00:51:31,953
"Am I expelled?" he asked.

384
00:51:33,775 --> 00:51:35,346
I nodded.

385
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:47,000
"My friends say I must go to town.
For here they could stone me.

386
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,405
"It's nonsense, isn't it?"

387
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:57,692
I'd read Semichastny's speech
in the "Komsomolskaya Pravda".

388
00:51:57,892 --> 00:52:05,226
"Sometimes we say about a pig
that it is this and that ...

389
00:52:05,426 --> 00:52:08,862
"It's slandering the pig."

390
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:12,665
"A pig never fouls the place where it eats.

391
00:52:12,865 --> 00:52:16,750
"If we compare Pasternak with the pig,

392
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:21,819
"the pig will never do what Pasternak did."

393
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,370
Applause.

394
00:52:57,426 --> 00:53:03,783
The time element is more complex
that the space element.

395
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:10,037
That day was awful
but it was a day of your life.

396
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:13,487
You want that day to return,

397
00:53:13,487 --> 00:53:21,198
you want to begin your life from the moment
it was interrupted at.

398
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:25,342
You want it to be glued in the place
where it was axed.

399
00:53:26,972 --> 00:53:28,942
But this is impossible.

400
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:33,923
The justice that triumphs after many years

401
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:40,489
is not that justice which your heart aspired for then.

402
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:46,363
And your heart is not the same now.

403
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:17,238
I wish you could see that man!

404
00:55:18,924 --> 00:55:26,250
Solzhenitsin is indescribable.
He should be seen in person,

405
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:33,169
in addition to his story
"One Day of Ivan Denisovich."

406
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:36,213
I read my poems to him
and he said:

407
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:40,494
"I knew that you're writing
what cannot be printed."

408
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:46,189
He said he writes a lot of prose.

409
00:55:46,389 --> 00:55:49,592
And I told him: "Do you know that in a month
you'll be the most famous man?"

410
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:51,102
"I do,"

411
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:53,545
"but that won't last long."

412
00:55:53,545 --> 00:55:56,962
"Will you endure the fame?"

413
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:59,942
"I've got strong nerves."

414
00:56:00,142 --> 00:56:04,192
"I've endured Stalin's camps."

415
00:56:04,392 --> 00:56:13,668
He's a great writer,
giving us back our language,

416
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:16,814
loving Russia as Blok has put it:

417
00:56:17,014 --> 00:56:20,599
"deadly insulted by love."

418
00:56:51,201 --> 00:56:54,718
" ... And if sometimes my country

419
00:56:54,718 --> 00:56:59,231
wants to raise a lasting monument to me

420
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:03,638
I give consent to this my fame,

421
00:57:03,638 --> 00:57:07,871
With only one condition: not to place it

422
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:12,718
by the sea where I was born -

423
00:57:12,918 --> 00:57:17,287
My ties with open seas are broken now -

424
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:22,376
Not there in parkland, by the tree

425
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:27,014
where the restless shade still haunts in vain,

426
00:57:27,214 --> 00:57:31,868
But here where I kept my vigil

427
00:57:32,068 --> 00:57:36,294
And where the locks were heedless of my grief,

428
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:41,574
Lest I forget in death's last sleep

429
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:45,840
How the fateful Black Marias rumbled,

430
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,497
Or how the dreadful door would crash,

431
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:54,600
Or how the women wailed like wounded beasts,

432
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:59,814
So then the melting snow, like tears, shall drop

433
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:05,059
from my unmoving, bronze-cast eyes,

434
00:58:05,259 --> 00:58:11,300
The prison dove shall coo nearby

435
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:16,069
And watch the passing ships along the Neva.

436
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:48,436
There is something odd about the human soul ...

437
00:59:50,126 --> 00:59:52,935
Poems, even the greatest,

438
00:59:53,974 --> 00:59:56,975
fail to make the author happy.

439
00:59:58,047 --> 01:00:00,228
Pushkin knew.

440
01:00:00,428 --> 01:00:04,324
He wrote "The Bronze Horseman".

441
01:00:05,538 --> 01:00:08,376
Yet, he wasn't happy.

442
01:00:12,994 --> 01:00:17,346
But we can say with confidence
that more than anything else

443
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,316
Pushkin wanted to write more.

444
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:10,654
And what about Akhmatova?

445
01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:21,683
Now, let me warn you that this is
the last time that I'll exist

446
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:24,959
No, not as water from a well,

447
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:28,477
Nor reed, nor evening star

448
01:03:28,677 --> 01:03:31,136
Nor maple leaves rustling afar,

449
01:03:31,336 --> 01:03:33,860
Nor distant tolling bell.

450
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,014
I shall not trouble people at all,

451
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:40,498
I shall not disturb their sad dreams

452
01:03:40,498 --> 01:03:44,277
As stifled groan or wail

453
01:03:48,686 --> 01:03:51,753
