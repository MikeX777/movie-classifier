1
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,870
Come on! Move it! Move it!

2
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,510
We're in position...

3
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,060
Recon 1 in command.
There is activity at the first building!

4
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,540
Come on! Get down!
We have not whole day!

5
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,910
- Recon, Give us your positions!
- Proceeding to the first building!

6
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,830
- Copy, Lieutenant!
- Copy!

7
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,500
This pace is wired up completely!

8
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,700
Beware, Recon!
They are inside the walls!

9
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,830
Recon 1 in command!

10
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,540
Copy Lieutenant!

11
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,627
We have secured the first building!

12
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,110
Recon 1. This is Tollander. Proceed to
second building and secure positions!

13
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,310
Go away with you!

14
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,030
Go!

15
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,660
Recon 1, Do you copy?

16
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,919
Recon! What the hell
is going on out there?

17
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,070
Recon 1, in command.
I have them at shot!

18
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,310
Recon 1, This is Tollander.
What is the status of hostages?

19
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,300
Alive!

20
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,580
Recon 1, hold position. We have a UN
negotiator coming in.

21
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:51,353
Repeat! Hold your positions!
Hold you fire!

22
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,340
Who the fuck is that?

23
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:01,871
Tollander. Did you send someone in?

24
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,060
Didn't send anyone in, Bishop!
No one!

25
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,740
I am telling you. He is one of ours!

26
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:12,835
Repeat! We did not send anyone in!
Hold your positions!

27
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:16,337
He is against the terrorists.
He has opened fire!

28
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,620
Get them out!
Send your team in there, now!

29
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,580
Man! I'm going in!

30
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,430
Who the fuck are you?
Are you carzy?

31
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,340
Sherwood!
Nothing personal, Bishop!

32
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,900
Ouch! Just business!

33
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,670
Sorry, Love!

34
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,979
November, 9748 Charly, by Tower!

35
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,310
N9748C Flight is authorized
to land on runway 07!

36
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,230
N 9748 Charlie. Runaway 07.
Roger that!

37
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,100
Home sweet home! What is
"home" for you, Bishop?

38
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,180
Right there! Pass it to me!

39
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,230
Thanks!

40
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,390
November 9748 Charlie, You're
cleared to taxi to Bay 31 A.

41
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:54,104
A good day! And you, thank you!

42
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:06,751
November 9748 Charlie.

43
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,380
So you're having a good day?
That is about to change!

44
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,820
Mark this is Smith. Confirm position.
The captain says it is 31 A!

45
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,180
31 A confirmed!

46
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,110
This job, means need to look
smart and not like hired beef.

47
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,270
We are not hired beef!

48
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,020
Consider this as an advance. Get some stuff
for you and buy a new pair of shoes!

49
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,620
Clasic like yours?

50
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,659
No, new!
Thanks, this is comfortable!

51
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,780
Contact Senator Todd and tell that
I'm meeting him next week!

52
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,260
Excuse, Mr. Trent. We'll be
disembarking in a few minutes!

53
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,820
- Thanks...
- Michael!

54
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,790
Right, Michael!
Forgive my husband.!

55
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,470
Mrs. Trent, Your car will be waiting
to take you directly to your club!

56
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,750
Do you play Michael? Mrs. Trent?

57
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,420
- Golf, of course!
- No!

58
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,400
That's a failing on your part...
So as calling me Mrs. Trent.

59
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,143
Now Michael, Fix me a drink.
I like a Tequini, a Martini...

60
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,977
I'm not a bartender, Mrs. Trent!

61
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,140
State of the art protection!
I really wish you wear armour!

62
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,470
Everyone assumes we do!

63
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,860
- They compensate.
- They, who?

64
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,100
Whoever.

65
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,470
We're opening the doors.
Bring the cars around.

66
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:15,030
I spy with my little eyes, something
that begins with the letter "B".

67
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,550
Bodyguard.

68
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,100
Ah! Ouch...!

69
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,420
One Mississippi...
Two Mississippi... It's bang.

70
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:19,047
Two seconds is a mile and a
half away and may be 2!

71
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,580
- Got him!
- I don't see anything?

72
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:26,761
He's on the roof!
They are firing Bishop! Firing!

73
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:30,023
Keep her down! Keep her down!
He is on the roof!

74
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,150
Dedicated little bastard.
Aren't you mine?

75
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,300
Very good, Mr.Bodyguard!

76
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,700
It's your lucky day, Mr.Bodyguard.

77
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,770
Hold it!

78
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,810
Hey! How're you doing?

79
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,700
Oh you know you've got speed.
You're 30 seconds early!

80
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,260
- Stop!
- Why?

81
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,860
I shoot you if I have to!
No, No. You won't...

82
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,620
...But if you did at that distance,
my upper part will be your best bet.

83
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,630
But then, may be I'm wearing armour?

84
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,860
I said don't move!

85
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,459
You know hitting my head is
rather difficult target...

86
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,590
...specially when the cock in
your revolver is not armed.

87
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,630
That makes the first shot
needing double action.

88
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:28,362
No no. Head's going to be
terribley difficult to make!

89
00:16:28,562 --> 00:16:30,182
Excuse me!

90
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,700
And look, you use two hands to hold
the revolver, and I use only one.

91
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,390
Shut up, Shut up or I'll shoot!
Oh, calm down love! Have it...

92
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,180
...your way.

93
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:03,232
He has a gun!
What the hell happened?

94
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,942
Let's go! Thank you for coming!

95
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:37,015
- See you later!
- Coming!

96
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:43,513
Do not touch!
You should not you play with food!

97
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:47,324
Be happy! Please!
These are yours!

98
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,071
Let's take these plates!

99
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,588
Wait! Reply me!

100
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:01,305
It spreads everywhere now!
I know... nanny is home today...

101
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,580
Hello... Mrs. Nielsen.

102
00:18:06,782 --> 00:18:09,582
Mr. Putley. Yes sir.

103
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:13,070
Of course I appreciate your
confidence sir.

104
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:16,566
See you in 20 minutes.
Yes Sir! Thank you!

105
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,150
Agent Castle!
Mr. Putley. Sir, I just arrived.

106
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,150
I'll find out who is holding the suspects.
Detective Seargent Harris.

107
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,420
Has he been informed that
we are taking over?

108
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,220
Apparently not.

109
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,470
I want you shooting all over the terrace.
Excuse! Detective Harris?

110
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,465
Detective Sergeant Harris!
I'm a little busy right now.

111
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,060
Special agent Castle, sir.
A Fed?

112
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:58,083
We should've the place clean.

113
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,100
You are not here to give me any hassle
about jurisdiction, Mrs. Castle?

114
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,300
No, Sir the jurisdiction is very clear.
Good.

115
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:10,190
The instance the first bullet crossed the
airport, this becomes a matter of the Bureau.

116
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,060
I have a dead man who never got
within 2 miles of your airport!

117
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,070
Detective Harris, would you
give me a coffee please?

118
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:27,071
What? Fuck yourself!

119
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,310
Then you're of not use to me whatsoever.

120
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:33,108
Pull out your men. Seal the roof.
FBI team will arrive in 20 minutes.

121
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,408
Thanks!

122
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,140
Is that the suspect over there?
Yes, he is there.

123
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,540
9mm Baretta, model JFS,
large magazine capacity...

124
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,542
Capable of four autaomatic fire.

125
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,622
Muzzle velocity?

126
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:58,223
350 meters per second, but I always think
it is impressive in feet! Don't you?

127
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,390
It is my gun, not my penis,
Detective!

128
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,030
- Special Agent Castle.
- A Fed?!

129
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,099
Terrific!

130
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:12,352
How long did you work for Trents?
For 12 days!

131
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,900
Who hired you?

132
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,309
His chief of security, Jack Marker!
Now he is dead!

133
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,620
Did you receive any briefing regarding
any of Mr. Trent's enemies?

134
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,900
- He had them.
- That's evident!

135
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,899
Do you know you're played dead?

136
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,500
Pay the salary!
Afraid not this week!

137
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,070
Can I ask you something, Agent Castle?
Hm...

138
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,550
Why do you have ice cream
all over your notes?

139
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,550
It's my daughter's birthday today!

140
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,150
But you're here...
Dedicated or ambitious?

141
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,660
Mr. Bishop, In most
successful assasinations,

142
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,664
bodyguards are killed with
with their principles.

143
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,630
And those who aren't,
half are involved with murder.

144
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,300
Straight for the jugular!
Where will I see you?

145
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,790
At the Trent's estate!
That if you're not holding me.

146
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,670
I don't know you that well,

147
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,670
but I will have to confiscate your weapon.
You won't need it! We are taking over now.

148
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,300
Sure Doc! Keep it warm for me!
You are free to go!

149
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:18,391
Thank you for your time!
And I thank you!

150
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,380
Fifteen dollars!
Here, keep the rest!

151
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:29,535
Thank you!

152
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,580
Bishop to Queen's knight 2!

153
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:43,381
Bishop to Queen's knight 2!
Absurd!

154
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:45,856
I wonder what you learned
at the Naval Academy!

155
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:49,864
As always, you mistake...
Improvisation for artistry.

156
00:21:50,064 --> 00:21:53,184
Michael... Michael... Michael...

157
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,470
Appear as an angel,
casting shadows of my past.

158
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,900
How are you, my dear?
I'm alive, professor!

159
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,000
And you?

160
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:09,152
Bureau and our whole espionage empire
are conspiring to bore me to death.

161
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,640
I find it hard to believe you?

162
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,389
As far as I remember, your simplest
games were the ones we dreaded most.

163
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:23,461
Battle of Judah! Biblical
version of the Gulf War.

164
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:28,385
An army inspired by God, and you
collide with advanced technology.

165
00:22:28,725 --> 00:22:31,445
Lord was with Judas,
but he could not drive the

166
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,979
inhabitants from the plane, because
they had chariots of iron.

167
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:41,277
Judges, 1:19! Old testate!

168
00:22:42,856 --> 00:22:46,346
Even though you were on the side
of the angels this time?

169
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:49,364
An old heathen like me?

170
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:53,742
I prefer men of iron
instead of clay idols.

171
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:04,336
Simon...
I heard all about Jeffry Trent!

172
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:09,338
Television networks were full
of him. They are shocked!

173
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:13,378
It's also very tedious.

174
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:19,912
I'm a bodyguard professor, I'm
not supposed to lose my client!

175
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:25,393
Poor Michael, a samurai
without his Shogun!

176
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:29,345
Marco! Refreshments!

177
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:33,827
Have we no manners?

178
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:48,523
Is silent! But very
very beautiful!

179
00:23:49,724 --> 00:23:54,844
Well Michael, Shall we discuss
this ridiculous move of yours.

180
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,170
The reminder that requests
State contraband reports, Jess?

181
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:12,161
Hello, Lindsay! It's me, Can I
speak to Melissa for a minute?

182
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:15,733
Mr Putley, We are preparing ourselves!
There's some company for you to catch!

183
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:18,686
- Company?
- Secret company!

184
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,165
Jess, introduce yourself
to my daughter!

185
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:22,571
Sure!

186
00:24:22,857 --> 00:24:26,247
Hi Melissa, this is Jess!
Work together with your mom.

187
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,249
Apparently CIA had Jeffry Trent
under surveillance for the past year.

188
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:34,812
Now in the interst of
inter-departmental corporation

189
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:38,814
and to help keep company smooth,
and even hiding in my underworld jobs

190
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:42,813
I've given them permission
to observe your operation.

191
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:46,376
Observe, nothing more!
I understand Sir.

192
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:49,417
Have fun, Castle!

193
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,905
Nice piece of work on Mr. Trent.

194
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:15,165
The fact is that the assasin
not only blown his heart out...

195
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:16,871
but has put a gate through him!

196
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:20,467
Oh I'm sorry! He is Mr. Hickey!
And I am Nicholas Tollander!

197
00:25:20,657 --> 00:25:22,467
Let me guess! You're the officer
in charge of research?

198
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:25,467
Yes, Special Agent Castle!

199
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Why is the Agency interested
in our dead body now?

200
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,680
Jeffrey Trent amassed a fortune!
Computers, missile guidance systems.

201
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:36,756
Few mismanaged defence contracts...

202
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:40,756
and recession almost put
him out of business.

203
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,399
Check!

204
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,970
So he quit living a life of good,
patron of humanitarian actions..

205
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:53,291
In war torn countries like Bosnia, South
Africa... and flying injured orphans out...

206
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:56,773
At the same time, his financial problems
began to mesteriously clear up...

207
00:25:57,094 --> 00:25:59,014
Believe Agent Castle,
he was running guns!

208
00:25:59,194 --> 00:26:02,014
Now understand how delicate
the situation is!

209
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:07,327
So he was running guns?
Who wanted Trent dead?

210
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:13,969
A short list.. Lybians, Iranians...
Check!

211
00:26:14,902 --> 00:26:21,892
Iraqis, Germans! Any number of
swindled businessmen, Spurn lovers...

212
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:27,904
Why this sudden obssession
on who killed Trent?

213
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:32,617
I would've never recommend you for the
job if I knew you become so upset!

214
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:36,577
- I'm not!
- Good, Michael!

215
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:43,348
It's Chess gives us the luxury of seeing
all the men anticipating all moves...

216
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:47,031
Life isn't so forgiving...

217
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:51,234
I never show the shooter
who put me in this chair...

218
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:54,234
Was he one of theirs, one of ours...

219
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:58,466
Some bureaucrats suddenly
disliked my lifestyle...

220
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,428
Made me a security risk...

221
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:04,428
I thought I was protected
by our rules...

222
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,840
Indifference to chance is a
great vanity in any game...

223
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:22,795
Was Trent indiffernt to chance?
Jeffery was indifferent to everything!

224
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:27,877
But Jeffery was seduced by power...
Wanted to be the king of the arms deals!

225
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:33,280
Certainly didn't care who got
trampled on the way to the cognition!

226
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,922
And now his kingdom is up for grabs!

227
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:47,605
- Long live...
- The White queen!

228
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:05,833
- The fare?
- 25 dollars!

229
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:15,241
- Hold!
- Thanks!

230
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:25,058
Here!

231
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:33,287
It's all yours!

232
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:36,285
I'll wait in the car! Bye!

233
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:39,208
Won't you stay?

234
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:43,208
No! I think a man's first case
should be a personal thing...

235
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:47,101
Besides you need the car ready.
Good luck!

236
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:08,451
I appreciate your concern,
Agent Castle!

237
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:10,951
I feel safe if...
Bishop protects me!

238
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:14,062
Oh I'm afraid it is not so
simple, Mrs Trent!

239
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:23,425
Our investigation is still on going!
I want Bishop as my head of security!

240
00:30:23,636 --> 00:30:26,906
After all he was the only one
who reacted this morning.

241
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,470
All of the others... ah they just...
Died?

242
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,871
Yes.

243
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:36,472
Can I get my gun back now?

244
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:45,844
Get down!

245
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,518
Get down!

246
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:57,959
Get down!

247
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:06,651
Give me the gun!

248
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,681
Where the hell are you?

249
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:27,995
Another one for your collection, Castle!
Thank you!

250
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,196
You are a one hell of shot my boy...

251
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,696
...but did you have to
kill my only lead?

252
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:35,181
I'm sorry! May be I was
shooting in fear.

253
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,480
Who is he?

254
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:40,479
His name was Elliot Holden!

255
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,079
He was a former Trent employee!

256
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:45,932
He also used to be Mrs, Trent's
favourite past times!

257
00:32:47,934 --> 00:32:50,894
Yes, get it to a ballistics please!
May I see that?

258
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:55,444
This is my investigation Mr. Bishop!
Trents were my responsibility.

259
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:58,366
Put this on!

260
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:01,366
Thanks!

261
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:09,689
This is not the man who killed my client!
Really? Enlighten us!

262
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:19,864
Rifle butt is too short for his size.

263
00:33:20,305 --> 00:33:24,255
You see that mark here?
Yeah! What about it?

264
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:26,217
It's called an "idiot guide"!

265
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,217
He was too close to the
scope when he fired!

266
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,459
An amateur's mistake!

267
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:33,859
Look Mr. Bishop! In this
morning you didn't jackshit,

268
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,659
and now you're full of answers.

269
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:40,782
Let me show you something, Castle!

270
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:47,705
- See that green mailbox?
- Yes!

271
00:33:47,911 --> 00:33:49,711
Set the scope at dead centre!

272
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,799
Are you on?
Yeah! I'm on! So What?

273
00:33:59,483 --> 00:34:03,443
You son of a bitch, this is vital
evidence! Should have you arrested!

274
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:05,844
Take a look at your mark.

275
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:11,556
The sights are off.

276
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,996
Telescope sight does not match the eye!
A professional wouldn't use the weapon!

277
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:18,237
And he didn't.

278
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:33,202
What's that for?
The "idiot guide"... Your's.

279
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,880
Hey, Mikey. Give you a lift?

280
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,380
You took me for a ride once Nick.

281
00:34:56,703 --> 00:35:01,703
Hey Mikey. I'm hurt over here!
Your court martial wasn't personal!

282
00:35:01,985 --> 00:35:03,855
I told them that I believe you,
but someone had to pay

283
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:06,262
or the heat still would've persued.

284
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:10,327
I guess there wouldn't have been an
initiative if I hadn't pulled through.

285
00:35:10,787 --> 00:35:13,777
Yeah! Bad form on your part.

286
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:18,177
Mikey between you and me?
Do you know the mess with Rifi?

287
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:25,953
Before my time.
"Before my time". Good answer.

288
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:30,666
So you're not involved
in this mess Mikey.

289
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:03,648
You left this at the airport.
Home, sweet home.

290
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,360
Why not you get in?
I'll give you a ride.

291
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:41,303
Sherwood, Kill that fucking light!

292
00:37:00,992 --> 00:37:05,912
Your daughter... How old?
Melissa turns five today.

293
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:08,714
And she had chocolate
cake for her birthday?

294
00:37:08,874 --> 00:37:11,714
With vanilla icing.

295
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:24,629
You're in over your head.
Someone's playing you Castle!

296
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:27,081
Mr. Bishop. Leave this to
the paid professionals

297
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:29,081
and don't leave the town.
Yeah! I know that well!

298
00:37:56,052 --> 00:38:02,002
Cash or card Mr... Orsava?
It'll be cash.

299
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,607
- 302.
- Thank you.

300
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:24,694
What?
Well I'm to inform you that they...

301
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:27,784
With what?
Would you like me to stay?

302
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:31,778
Should the bodyguard prove troublesome...
That's only because...

303
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:34,858
Oh! You have them wired my usual fee
to the same Ireland account...

304
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:38,177
Two days will be sufficient.

305
00:38:51,194 --> 00:38:53,474
Lindsey.

306
00:38:57,798 --> 00:39:04,348
Lindsey... Wake up.
Why don't you go to your bed?

307
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,069
What time is it?
It is real late.

308
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:11,402
Your boss called. He said to see
him first thing tomorrow.

309
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:14,911
That figures. Goodnight!
Goodnight!

310
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:39,111
I love you baby!

311
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:32,765
Who you are trying to
get away from, Bishop?

312
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:36,848
Court Martial,
Deposistion Nicholas Tollander.

313
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:39,851
Fired without honor!

314
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,313
- Report, Castle!
- Sir!

315
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:49,936
I've got agents canvassing the airport
hotel with Eliot Holden's photos!

316
00:42:50,146 --> 00:42:53,076
But I'm not convinced that he shot
Trent. Besides calibre 22...

317
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:57,075
Ballistics claims that scope
was changed before he dropped it...

318
00:42:57,275 --> 00:43:02,365
...And when accidentally fired by us.
I didn't see these findings sir.

319
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:06,131
There's a copy waiting for
you since 9 this morning.

320
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:08,893
You said Holden and
Mrs. Trent were involved?

321
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,886
They had a brief affair but it
ended when he got fired 6 months ago.

322
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:16,205
That seems pretty cut and dry to me.
A crime of passion.

323
00:43:16,618 --> 00:43:19,628
Didn't frustrate job.
Congratulations!

324
00:43:19,828 --> 00:43:22,328
One of Trent's bodyguards
pointed out inconsistencies...

325
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,300
I don't know we assigned
a bodyguard to this case.

326
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,300
Case is closed.

327
00:45:26,028 --> 00:45:27,818
How're you doing, Lou? I'm fine.

328
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:29,818
Good!

329
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:36,579
You know, the first time I signed a
report, I was anxious for weeks.

330
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:41,273
I get wondering if some...
you'd send was jab up Mikey's ass..

331
00:45:41,474 --> 00:45:43,594
Charming! Get to the point,
Mr Tollander!

332
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:48,194
You read Mikey's file?
I sure did!

333
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:52,587
Good! Then you know about that
little incident in Bosnia?

334
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,589
Yes.

335
00:45:55,718 --> 00:46:01,508
Mikey had a mission to rescue four
Serbian officers that were being...

336
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:06,162
held captive by some Muslim
terrorists. It went sour!

337
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:11,204
I also read that your testimony
earned him a dishonourable discharge!

338
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:15,794
Come on! They wanted to put the man into
Leavenworth. I saved him from that!

339
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:19,236
I like Mickey.
A real stand up guy.

340
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:25,278
I just don't know what happened to him.
Your point...?

341
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,550
My point is Agent Castle, that the
Agency believes, as a matter of fact...

342
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,850
we know that Trent armed
those terrorists...

343
00:46:34,054 --> 00:46:36,694
Bishop wanted to avenge against Trent?

344
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:39,894
You think he conspired with Elliot
Holden? Get real!

345
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,298
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind here.

346
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:48,847
I find it a little bit convenient
that Mikey is working for Trent..

347
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,860
And that he also underhand whacked Holden
before you got a chance to question him.

348
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:59,663
He was in the line of fire.
In the line of fire...

349
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:05,326
I got you!

350
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:13,028
You know. I hadn't thought about that.
It a hell of an alibi, then?

351
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:16,149
Have a nice day.

352
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:41,786
Come on! Oh Lady!

353
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:52,451
Come on! Hurry! What's it?

354
00:50:03,896 --> 00:50:05,606
Come on, Come on!

355
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:11,449
Hey! How're you doing?

356
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:54,594
Very tempting.

357
00:51:01,717 --> 00:51:03,587
Here he goes now.

358
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,909
Mr. Bodyguard.

359
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,520
Yeah...
This is Gamble. Target is still viable.

360
00:54:09,841 --> 00:54:14,581
Any laundry?
One load. It's in room 302.

361
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,594
- Where are you?
- Yorkdale lnn.

362
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:20,034
Will pick up you in 15 minutes.

363
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:29,546
I need a van rolling. Yorkdale Inn.
Room 302.

364
00:54:31,339 --> 00:54:35,789
What happened?
Gamble loses our reputation?

365
00:54:36,341 --> 00:54:38,951
It happens.

366
00:54:41,483 --> 00:54:44,083
It didn't go.

367
00:55:04,973 --> 00:55:10,053
He was awakened by a kiss.
Only fools...

368
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:13,563
What really woke the princess
Sleeping Beauty up?

369
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:16,727
He woke her and took off.
You're sick

370
00:55:16,932 --> 00:55:19,732
9 months later still asleep,
she gave birth to twins.

371
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:22,287
One of them looking for nipple
to milk sucked the spinning finger

372
00:55:22,492 --> 00:55:26,012
got the needle out from
her finger... So she woke up.

373
00:55:26,213 --> 00:55:28,613
You should get yourself fixed.
She never had kids...

374
00:55:31,983 --> 00:55:36,063
Ok. What do you want to watch?
"Beauty and the Beast" or "Jungle books"?

375
00:55:36,264 --> 00:55:41,584
Maxi wants to see this one!
A spy movie? Where did this come from?

376
00:55:41,907 --> 00:55:46,177
Eli gave it! She says
Sean Connery is a buff!

377
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:49,098
A buff? Buff...?

378
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,589
Mommy are you a spy?

379
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:56,189
No mommy is not a spy and Max
and you should see Cinderella.

380
00:55:56,472 --> 00:56:00,942
Hellow. Castle. Castle or Max
...Hellow?

381
00:56:54,655 --> 00:56:55,875
Come in.

382
00:56:57,174 --> 00:57:01,834
Got the report Sir. We are just
finishing up with Holden's body now.

383
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:05,729
Castle, when was the last
time you saw the bodyguard?

384
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:08,229
When I dropped him off at his hotel.

385
00:57:08,406 --> 00:57:13,176
Let me know if you hear from him.
He is wanted for questioning.

386
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,911
- Is that all, Mr. Putley?
- Yes.

387
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:41,181
Hey, Castle.

388
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,180
From where did you get that?
Are you crazy?

389
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:49,511
Cardboard, scissors, photobooth...
Fine in a class, but a little tough!

390
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:53,671
You've identified the sniper?
The real one?

391
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:59,501
This case is closed Mr. Bishop.
Oh really?

392
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,101
Agent Castle!

393
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:05,541
Hi! Mr Tollander... Shouldn't you
be on a plane back to Langley?

394
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:11,301
I'd love to! But I heard Bishop
whacked somebody last night!

395
00:58:11,504 --> 00:58:14,744
I want him for that.
- You're not authorised to act domestically.

396
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:20,741
Ah! Well... that's the beauty
of Code Red operations!

397
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:23,741
No! It's not Code Red!
Don't let me tell someone!

398
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:26,981
You are threatening me,
aren't you Agent?

399
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:32,431
Do I need to?
Let me give you some advise!

400
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:35,691
Mikey Bishop is a contract
killer out of control.

401
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:37,776
I suggest that if you hang a
little while with him, he will

402
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:41,783
whack your body armour...
becuase anybody he uses...

403
00:58:42,031 --> 00:58:46,421
...ends up dead!
Have a nice day!

404
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:56,941
No one uses me.

405
00:58:57,139 --> 00:58:58,939
Someone tried to hide
me in ice last night.

406
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:01,621
They were professionals.

407
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:05,341
They have access to
"Keener Kleener" crew.

408
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:08,341
No lables on the clothes.
Everything untraceable!

409
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:12,871
And you think they were sent by
Trent's killer? Now it's a conspiracy?

410
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:16,131
I hadn't been long enough in
the town to piss up anybody else!

411
00:59:16,325 --> 00:59:18,225
Don't underestimate yourself.

412
00:59:18,631 --> 00:59:20,161
So what do you think?

413
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:23,659
Whatever I think I think that solving this
case makes me look like everybody is a hero.

414
00:59:24,391 --> 00:59:28,781
I know there is a big difference between
closing a case and solving it!

415
00:59:28,991 --> 00:59:31,811
Don't give me that crap!
Only thing you close is coffins!

416
00:59:31,991 --> 00:59:34,111
I read your file Mr. Bishop!

417
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:39,461
What did you do for the Naval Intelligence
that was too 'hot' for official record?

418
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:41,331
3 Years and no record?

419
00:59:41,525 --> 00:59:46,025
What did I do?
Everything they told me to!

420
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:54,591
What do they offer you for
closing down this case, Castle?

421
00:59:54,786 --> 00:59:57,386
Promotion?

422
00:59:58,551 --> 01:00:02,241
And what do you think that you
get with that? Respect?

423
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:06,391
Security. Does that
disappoint you Mr. Bishop?

424
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:10,990
If it dares tell me how many daughters you can
raise out of that travelling bag of yours.

425
01:00:11,231 --> 01:00:14,151
None! So do not lecture me, unless
you can reach into that bag

426
01:00:14,331 --> 01:00:16,751
and pull out hair braces or

427
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:20,621
house with a back yard to swing a
set of fucking chop of birthday cake!

428
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:24,391
How long do you think you
can play by the rules?

429
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,487
This isn't a game!

430
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:30,861
I'm the one who has to go home every single
night and look my little girl on the face

431
01:00:33,551 --> 01:00:38,391
Alright! You go ahead. Collect
your dirty pieces of silver.

432
01:00:38,585 --> 01:00:39,995
Hand over the gun, Bishop!
Excuse me?

433
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:42,821
I said hand over the gun!

434
01:00:44,591 --> 01:00:47,871
Now this is going to be a habit.
Yeah, one I'm tired of too.

435
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:53,661
All I need is a video enhancer!
Where did you get that?

436
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:55,501
Bank machine.

437
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:59,751
You busted into an automatic teller
machine? I'm a law officer, Bishop!

438
01:00:59,911 --> 01:01:03,381
Then act like one insted of
a god damn politician!

439
01:01:09,151 --> 01:01:10,501
Thank you.

440
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:18,511
That's about the time of hit. And that's
the snap he's going in the backyard.

441
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:21,151
To the next frame.

442
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:33,781
Keep going.

443
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:38,511
Keep going.

444
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:50,301
What is him? What is wrong?

445
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:59,791
Jason Jarvis Sherwood,
Appeared to be trained from 1974-1976.

446
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:04,431
Special forces 76,
till his retirement in 83.

447
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:10,301
Then he went freelance. Confirmed hits...
...Abdul Komhani, Iranian Secret Police.

448
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:16,101
Karl Borgan, Uranium Technology Dealer.
Happie Albert, American Oil refiner.

449
01:02:17,111 --> 01:02:19,151
You know him?

450
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:23,221
Sherwood was the reason I spent
three years in the hospital.

451
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,220
I need to make call,
You have a quarter?

452
01:02:35,871 --> 01:02:38,511
- Yeah?
- Professor, it's Bishop.

453
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:42,981
No more riddles. I want to know the
connection between Tollander and Trent?

454
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:47,021
Bosnia. You remember Michael.
You were there!

455
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:49,071
Trent financed the terrorists.

456
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,266
Common knowledge!
But no one asked who was...

457
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:57,711
Who financed Trent? The Agency?
What was there agenda, Michael?

458
01:02:58,031 --> 01:03:02,341
Every group, very person
has a socialising agenda.

459
01:03:02,551 --> 01:03:06,311
The hostages were Serbian officers.
They used be trusted by the Muslims.

460
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:09,541
Not the type of people we
usually go into rescue.

461
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:15,751
There was no rescue mission.
Very good Michael! Not the first time.

462
01:03:16,031 --> 01:03:20,581
Tollander had tried liquidating
an embarrassment, as I well know.

463
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,591
I'll be outside.

464
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,791
You think Tollander put you
in that wheelchair Professor?

465
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:29,539
I wouldn't be surprised to
find out this case.

466
01:03:29,741 --> 01:03:33,941
Sherwood was his triggerman
for a long before today.

467
01:03:49,631 --> 01:03:51,511
Call an ambulance!

468
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:35,421
Where is Sherwood?

469
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:47,571
Castle... Castle... No Castle, it'll
be alright. Nice and easy... Breath...

470
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:52,551
You'll be alright Castle...
Nice and easy... alright, breathe.

471
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:56,071
You'll be alright, You'll be alright!
Nice and easy!

472
01:05:04,671 --> 01:05:07,581
I feel like being hit
by a sledgehammer.

473
01:05:07,911 --> 01:05:10,221
Yeah! I know the feeling!

474
01:05:12,911 --> 01:05:15,551
I have an address for us!

475
01:05:21,391 --> 01:05:26,781
A problem... Gentlemen... is
that your thinking... is very bad.

476
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:31,061
How the hell do you think
we should think?

477
01:05:31,271 --> 01:05:34,061
Not like fucking amateurs!

478
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:36,671
Fuck you my boy!

479
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:45,181
If you want Bishop and the woman,
you have to make them come to you!

480
01:05:48,471 --> 01:05:51,351
Sherwood... It's me.

481
01:05:55,471 --> 01:05:58,751
It's better be fucking important.

482
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:05,861
To put this gate!
Yes, put it here.

483
01:06:09,151 --> 01:06:12,061
- Hey, Norm.
- What have we got?

484
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:15,591
I want snipers covering this
back alleyway here.

485
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:19,131
And killer zone from here to here.
Castle. You got a problem.

486
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:20,830
I'll say when...

487
01:06:22,031 --> 01:06:26,231
Oh Shit! We've got to get them out of there!
That's alright. I'll get two of my men!

488
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:30,741
Two of us in civils. We should go!
Let's go.

489
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:59,021
Easy! Easy! It's probably
just the neighbor's cat again.

490
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,821
- Honey! Our car!
- What?

491
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,870
Somebody is watching.
Don't look back at the house!

492
01:07:10,431 --> 01:07:13,791
Check it out, do the watch still?
Yeah, Yeah!

493
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:18,341
Okay! Shit! Thank you for
a nice date!

494
01:07:21,231 --> 01:07:25,301
Well?
Kids playing ball of hockey.

495
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:29,941
Are they still watching? Are we clear?
We are clear.

496
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,911
No. Okay!

497
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:37,741
How are we? Are we clear? Yeah.

498
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:42,741
Guys! Get out of here! Fast! Go!

499
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:56,101
Go! Go! Go!

500
01:07:57,351 --> 01:08:02,271
It's the party time! Cover the door!
Putley in safety! Give me the gas mask!

501
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:14,631
Come on! Come on!

502
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:17,951
Move it! Move it!

503
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:16,231
Get up! On your feet! Move!

504
01:10:55,471 --> 01:10:58,351
Get moving! Get moving!

505
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:48,311
Damn!

506
01:12:13,031 --> 01:12:15,751
No! No! Please!

507
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:18,661
Put the gun away or
I'll snap her neck!

508
01:12:19,991 --> 01:12:22,951
Put it away!

509
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:29,351
Come on! Come on!

510
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:50,271
No! No! Stay down!

511
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:57,461
Stand up fucker! Stand up!

512
01:13:05,551 --> 01:13:09,341
- Put her down!
- Come on honey!

513
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,991
Take your shot Castle.
I can't. I don't have a clear shot!

514
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:23,071
- Shoot me, Castle!
- Look out!

515
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:27,271
Shit!

516
01:13:34,151 --> 01:13:36,221
Damn!

517
01:13:40,471 --> 01:13:43,221
Should've taken the shot.
Come on!

518
01:13:54,791 --> 01:13:57,261
There are a couple of
gentlemen flying down from

519
01:13:57,462 --> 01:13:59,262
Washington to talk
to you Mr. Putley!

520
01:13:59,951 --> 01:14:02,791
Good! I'll brief them of your
abuse of authority.

521
01:14:02,987 --> 01:14:05,987
Your disregard for the chain
of command. They'll be...

522
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:11,227
overjoyed to hear that you orderd a raid
on one of the Bureau's own safe houses!

523
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:13,791
Or you were protecting a
known contract killer.

524
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,790
I was holding Sherwood in custody!

525
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:21,901
Now I'm holding you Sir!
I couldn't trust your abilities...

526
01:14:22,099 --> 01:14:26,779
as an investigator. Your ambition
was getting in the way...

527
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:30,861
My ambition? Is that why you
assigned me to this?

528
01:14:31,064 --> 01:14:34,264
That's not the only reason, Louise.

529
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:38,671
You're fucked!

530
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:54,841
Incompetent bastard, isn't he?

531
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:58,341
That's not the only reason.
It sounds like a threat!

532
01:14:58,551 --> 01:15:01,831
He doesn't have anything
to threaten me with.

533
01:15:03,351 --> 01:15:05,421
Call home, Lou.

534
01:15:15,951 --> 01:15:19,341
Max wants to play a game.
Would Max like some popcorn too?

535
01:15:19,671 --> 01:15:20,721
Yeah. With cheese!

536
01:15:20,922 --> 01:15:24,222
Ok you pick a game. I'll go
and get some pop-corn.

537
01:15:32,511 --> 01:15:34,421
Hello?

538
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:38,991
Come on baby! Pick up.

539
01:15:39,951 --> 01:15:42,701
Come on! Pick up baby!

540
01:15:46,911 --> 01:15:48,581
Let's go.

541
01:15:53,911 --> 01:15:56,991
Agent Castle! I heard about
Putley. Congratulations!

542
01:15:57,190 --> 01:15:59,190
Get out of my way, Tollander.

543
01:16:00,911 --> 01:16:03,871
I also knew there was something
wrong about him.

544
01:16:06,511 --> 01:16:11,431
I went along with you on this.
If I go down, you go down with me.

545
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:17,471
You're not going down.

546
01:16:18,471 --> 01:16:21,701
You're going under a witness-
protection programme.

547
01:16:23,591 --> 01:16:27,821
Credt card, driver's license, social
security number. Whole your life.

548
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:32,621
Ahmed Bekbay?
The computer picks it. Not me.

549
01:16:37,471 --> 01:16:41,071
Sign up or sign off.
I won't make this offer again!

550
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:44,781
You're a prick, Tollander.

551
01:16:54,991 --> 01:16:57,461
Come on now, Gord.

552
01:17:03,631 --> 01:17:05,611
After you're transferred to
my custody, Mr. Hickey...

553
01:17:05,806 --> 01:17:07,406
...will take you anywhere
you want to go!

554
01:17:07,611 --> 01:17:08,911
Thanks for no thanks!

555
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:16,391
Enjoy it.

556
01:17:35,591 --> 01:17:38,791
- Tollander!
- Yeah.

557
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:45,351
- Bastard.
- Yes I am.

558
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,711
Very good, Mr. Hickey.
Very nice!

559
01:17:56,671 --> 01:17:58,341
You know where the files are.

560
01:18:13,831 --> 01:18:17,791
Mr Hickey...
Once this is over I want you to...

561
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:23,151
destroy Mr. Sherwood and his...
personal effects.

562
01:18:38,911 --> 01:18:40,791
No! Wait!

563
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:36,751
Bend! Bend her!

564
01:19:58,591 --> 01:20:01,741
- Bend her!
- I read in a book...

565
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:05,111
Don't shoot lady!

566
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:14,391
You bastards, where's my daughter?
I'm not at liberty to say.

567
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,911
Then you're of no use to
me whatsoever.

568
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:44,941
Castle... we're gonna find her.

569
01:20:45,191 --> 01:20:49,501
Fuck you! Fuck you!

570
01:21:03,711 --> 01:21:09,261
We want Bishop. New
Highway 9, Side Road 7.

571
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:25,101
They got my daughter, and
I'll trade her for you!

572
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:32,021
You'll be set up.
Understand how they think.

573
01:21:32,351 --> 01:21:35,551
They're using your
daughter as a pawn.

574
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:42,301
You and, Sherwood and Tollander
You all are the same.

575
01:21:43,311 --> 01:21:47,621
Killing me solves their problem.

576
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:51,191
You won't get Melissa back.

577
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:13,111
Found this in the evidence room.
It's from the safe house.

578
01:22:13,991 --> 01:22:18,861
Tollander was there with them.
I think he and Sherwood are in it.

579
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,140
Trent was working for the Agency,
And when he went out of...

580
01:22:21,343 --> 01:22:23,343
...control it was Tollander's
job to eliminate him.

581
01:22:23,591 --> 01:22:26,261
And they used Elliot Holden to
disguise it as a crime of passion.

582
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,460
Got anything up the shit yet?

583
01:22:28,911 --> 01:22:31,221
This game started a long time ago.

584
01:22:32,591 --> 01:22:35,391
We're getting close. Slow down.

585
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:42,951
Don't hesitate this time. If you get
the chance, take the shot!

586
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:47,221
Michael, I...

587
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:51,841
Hey look. If we live,
you can bake me a cake!

588
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:56,140
If we live, no alternative
to arrest your ass!

589
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:24,141
Agent Castle! Putley finally cracked
and the Agency found your daughter!

590
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:27,071
Whatever!

591
01:24:15,631 --> 01:24:18,431
Castle! No! Wait!

592
01:25:32,271 --> 01:25:36,901
- Melissa!
- Mommy? Mommy?

593
01:25:37,111 --> 01:25:40,901
Come here! I got you! I got you!

594
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:46,631
Hold on to me Okay. Put your legs
around me. Hold on!

595
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:49,101
I'm afraid!
You're gonna be OK sweetie!

596
01:26:16,391 --> 01:26:18,511
Opening a door or a window will
create a hell of a blast!

597
01:26:18,711 --> 01:26:21,511
This one is wired too.

598
01:26:21,791 --> 01:26:27,231
Mr Bishop! You played
an excellent game!

599
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:31,621
Nice come back from Bosnia!

600
01:26:36,911 --> 01:26:40,951
How many times did I shoot you?
Seven!

601
01:26:41,911 --> 01:26:44,511
Lucky seven! Ouch!

602
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:49,301
- Mommy!
- It's okay!

603
01:26:54,871 --> 01:26:57,671
Disappointment Bishop!

604
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:07,661
I didn't think you'd succumb
to such desperation!

605
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:15,911
You're dead now!

606
01:27:17,471 --> 01:27:19,271
Michael!

607
01:27:55,111 --> 01:27:57,671
We're going out through the basement.

608
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:10,271
Kill the light, Castle.

609
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:28,701
Get down!

610
01:28:51,551 --> 01:28:55,701
Come on! Let's go, let's go!
Come here, Come here, I got you!

611
01:28:56,151 --> 01:28:58,271
Let's go, Castle, come on!

612
01:29:01,911 --> 01:29:04,271
I'll go down first!
Then I'll get her!

613
01:29:08,911 --> 01:29:12,111
Did you catch her?
Watch your head!

614
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:20,711
Hold on to Mike Okay.
Watch your head.

615
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:08,631
It was fun so long as it lasted!

616
01:30:15,711 --> 01:30:18,351
Are you okay, Melissa?

617
01:30:20,191 --> 01:30:23,661
Are you all right? Let me see.
Keep your eyes shut.

618
01:30:25,191 --> 01:30:27,471
Okay.

619
01:31:18,831 --> 01:31:22,221
Got him! Fuck!

620
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:24,441
Mommy, he said a bad word?

621
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:25,741
Listen to elsewhere
right now sweetie!

622
01:31:25,943 --> 01:31:28,743
Bishop, nail the fucker!

623
01:31:31,071 --> 01:31:32,901
Bishop?

624
01:31:33,311 --> 01:31:35,751
One Mississippi...

625
01:31:36,511 --> 01:31:38,711
Two Mississippi...

626
01:31:39,711 --> 01:31:42,671
Nice try though.
Three Mississippi...

627
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:49,771
Ouch...

628
01:32:30,831 --> 01:32:34,301
I thought the queen was Susan Trent?

629
01:32:34,671 --> 01:32:38,901
Classic Mr. Blacksheep.
What finally tipped you?

630
01:32:39,631 --> 01:32:44,751
Bosnia. Assassination acted
like a rescue mission!

631
01:32:45,711 --> 01:32:48,581
When you mentioned Sherwood's
name I knew for certain.

632
01:32:48,782 --> 01:32:50,182
Aside from Castle and myself...

633
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:52,741
the only people who knew
Sherwood was involved

634
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:55,941
was those who were inside
the conspiracy!

635
01:32:56,871 --> 01:33:01,101
You decided to hit on Trent too.
Suggested dear!

636
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:03,631
Crippled old cronies aren't allowed
to do more than...

637
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:07,631
...suggest, submit, recommend.

638
01:33:09,871 --> 01:33:13,991
You wanted Tollander because you
think that he put you in that chair!

639
01:33:14,191 --> 01:33:15,251
Trent and Sherwood?

640
01:33:15,448 --> 01:33:18,748
Three of them cut me out
a very lucrative business.

641
01:33:19,551 --> 01:33:22,051
You knew I would trace this
back to you Simon!

642
01:33:22,251 --> 01:33:24,551
Why set yourself up like that?

643
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:29,711
Come, Michael!
Haven't you figured it out yet?

644
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:40,261
I am sick, Michael
...Sick of these people!

645
01:33:40,591 --> 01:33:46,381
Sick of myself, sick of
what's left of my soul!

646
01:33:46,631 --> 01:33:49,461
I want to end all this!

647
01:33:49,751 --> 01:33:55,541
And you my dear... my favourite
of my children instruments...

648
01:33:56,311 --> 01:33:59,381
...my dark angel!

649
01:34:09,111 --> 01:34:15,351
You have to do it, Michael! For
the woman, Castle knows too much!

650
01:34:16,311 --> 01:34:19,541
You have no choice, Michael!

651
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:24,341
Or I'll design a play to take
her and her daughter out!

652
01:34:24,631 --> 01:34:27,191
You can't escape!

653
01:34:28,391 --> 01:34:33,341
We both are made from the same
bloody mould Michael!

654
01:34:40,191 --> 01:34:44,741
The pawn. How dissatisfied!

655
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:34,301
You're free forever now!

656
01:35:34,591 --> 01:35:38,791
I won't be a target!
I'm staying on the board!

657
01:35:39,111 --> 01:35:42,631
Let's go and see my daughter.
Bishop would you drive pelase?

658
01:36:03,871 --> 01:36:07,831
Son of a bitch who put him on that
chair should have done a better job!

659
01:36:10,751 --> 01:36:13,271
I wish I had...!
