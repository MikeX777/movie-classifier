1
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,617
You’re going to do it now?
In front of the camera?

2
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,838
Do you know how to seed? Watch!

3
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,808
Santoalla...

4
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,546
here you are free.

5
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,958
It's different air...
a different experience.

6
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,825
Because when your children are here,
you have everything.

7
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,634
Julio was always everyone's favorite.

8
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,967
Almost every day...

9
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,646
he needs to feed the cows and take them to the mountain.

10
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,454
He loves the countryside and working the fields.

11
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,996
Carlos isn't crazy about working.

12
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,505
But, of course, I've always loved him very much.

13
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,170
because his mind is a little...

14
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,241
slow.

15
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,713
Manolo...he's eighty some years old now

16
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:50,760
He still wants to work but, I tell him not to worry about it.

17
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,597
If you can't, you can't.

18
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,175
We've lived here our whole lives.

19
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,202
And everything was fine.

20
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,844
In Santoalla, there were no problems.

21
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,957
But, when Martin disappeared...

22
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,824
there were a lot of officers here.

23
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,870
l was surprised when I saw them all.

24
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:39,712
They said, "Have you seen Martin?"

25
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,208
I said, "What are you talking about?"

26
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,209
They said, "Martin's gone."

27
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,279
I said, "I know nothing."

28
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,583
"He left..."

29
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:57,660
"and he never came back."

30
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,063
Martin, for me that was ... I don't know I don't know.

31
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,872
I don't want to say anything because I don't know.

32
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:12,238
But, if he didn't go away, somebody took him away.

33
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,619
Santa Eulalia.

34
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,959
They named the village after her,
Santa Eulalia.

35
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,064
If you ask from your heart she gives many things.

36
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,963
But, you have to ask the right way.

37
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,175
When Martin and Margo first got here...

38
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,547
we were alone here.

39
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,012
People started to leave...

40
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,554
because men were out of work.

41
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,248
There were no jobs here.

42
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,766
But, I like people coming here, normal people.

43
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,472
The village is big enough for three or four more neighbors

44
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:26,202
but, you need to get along with everyone.

45
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,139
So, I helped them as much as I could.

46
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,512
"Do good no matter to whom."

47
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,019
That's the proverb.

48
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,022
"Do good no matter to whom."

49
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:53,571
Galicia has always been a rural region,
but during the twentieth century

50
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:58,233
the number of people living on agriculture has diminished.

51
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,340
It is estimated that in recent years

52
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:04,243
nearly 300 villages in rural areas have been abandoned.

53
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,147
However, there are some people
who are leaving the city for the country

54
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,822
to make their living in agriculture.

55
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,748
They are the new inhabitants of the countryside.

56
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:54,256
This house used to be a stable but, the walls are very bad...

57
00:18:54,467 --> 00:19:00,269
and we are repairing it to be a good structure.

58
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:28,697
Our idea is an ecological center, like Noah's Ark.

59
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:33,804
A few things from different species...

60
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,834
from both plants and animals.

61
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:42,478
We also expect people to take

62
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,446
organic farming and things like that.

63
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,721
This campsite is for them.

64
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,710
I worked their garden and
the first few years were very productive

65
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,215
because I gave them sheep fertilizer.

66
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:26,189
And they grew huge carrots.

67
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,422
But, you need to work hard for that.

68
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,822
With a small hoe, you can't get that.

69
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,858
Our zucchini this year...like this.

70
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:36,962
Huge?

71
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,837
Huge. Impossible.

72
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,747
This place has a lot of potential.

73
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,478
All the places around here.

74
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:37,356
It's very beautiful...for tourism, canoeing, fishing, hiking...

75
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,623
there are a lot of possibilities here.

76
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,506
What do you think of your new neighbors?

77
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,443
I think it's good if they stick it out.

78
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,883
They came from Holland and
want to build a house for rural tourism.

79
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,318
And that's what they're doing.

80
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,925
Do you want to see their project succeed?

81
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,527
Yeah. Sure.

82
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,430
If they don't bother me, I won't bother them.

83
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,666
We love our land very much.

84
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,740
If there's a piece of land that's mine,
I don't want anyone to touch it.

85
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:06,976
It must be in our genes.

86
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,525
I used to come here with my parents
and my aunt when l was very young.

87
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,999
And now, l have a three year old son.

88
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:27,064
He's been coming here with me since he was born.

89
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:42,579
He likes it more than computer games,
tablets...more than anything.

90
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,655
He already tells his mother that
he doesn't want to go to school

91
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,390
that he wants to go with his father.

92
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,533
But, maybe he won't like it later.
Maybe he'll like girls better.

93
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,174
And girls won't come here.

94
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:43,537
I feel nostalgic about the past
because there's no one here now

95
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,922
But, as long as I'm around Santoalla won't be abandoned.

96
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,860
It's my village.

97
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,468
That's how it is.

98
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,178
What projects are you planning to start here?

99
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,525
Which ones have you started already?

100
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,717
Initially, man...

101
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:39,666
But, every year we have to consider if it's possible

102
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:46,141
I want to do things, but we have a lot of obstructions...

103
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,207
things that block our plans...

104
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,914
like the old neighbor that lives up there.

105
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:24,010
We have difficulties with everything we want to do here.

106
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:28,118
If I try to build a water mill, the neighbor says,

107
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,754
"You can't put that there!" Immediately.

108
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:38,556
When I clean a path and I want to
move the stones from the ruins

109
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:43,701
to build a wall for that same path

110
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,097
the neighbor immediately says,

111
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,103
"Those stones aren't yours!"

112
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:09,117
Neighbors should be on their own property."

113
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:16,093
To know that you need to live here
and know how things work here.

114
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,269
Everyone on their own property.

115
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:25,036
They were outsiders and they did what they wanted.

116
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:31,240
And in a village like this,
you need to do as everybody.

117
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,981
Of course.

118
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,346
Their mentality is very closed, absolutely closed.

119
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:09,744
And I simply can't understand this mentality.

120
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:13,091
I can't work this way.

121
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,058
Last question...

122
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,956
after being here for ﬁve years,

123
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:56,123
how do you see the future of these
villages in the Galician mountains?

124
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:59,827
Should they be rebuilt?

125
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,701
How do you see the future?

126
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,991
Only two families live in Santoalla,

127
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,525
a situation that should create a bond between them.

128
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,454
But, they haven‘t talked to each other for the last six years.

129
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:44,032
We had a good relationship with the neighbors before

130
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,602
but, now we don't. None at all.

131
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,441
The conflict got worse because the Dutch couple

132
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,873
requested to have rights on the common land.

133
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:31,540
This morning I put a sign in front of the village

134
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:36,646
that says, "Welcome to Santa Eulalia...

135
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,107
Kingdom of the Moroccans."

136
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,081
I put it there because sometimes

137
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,983
I feel like I'm living in an Arab country.

138
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:50,323
The old man here thinks he's Sun King of the village.

139
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,553
That it's his village.

140
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,196
I disagree with this idea.

141
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,265
He also says he's the mayor of the village.

142
00:33:56,468 --> 00:34:00,131
And that's not true. He's the mayor of nothing.

143
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:06,503
But, he is the president of the common land.

144
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:13,683
And that title not only involves rights
but, responsibilities as well.

145
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:18,416
He doesn't give us the same rights to the land as they have.

146
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:22,753
And he doesn't fulfill his obligations at all.

147
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,788
He kept all the money

148
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:29,326
and didn't spend any money ... not a cent on the village.

149
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,380
Trial number 27 of the year 2008.

150
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,115
We'll start with the questioning of the
president of the common land. ..

151
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,119
Manolo Rodriguez Fernandez.

152
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,668
You've seen the plaintiffs there,
living in a house in the village, right?

153
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,829
In the village? He's always in Germany or in...

154
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:14,769
or in Holland...he only comes for vacation.

155
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,775
They fixed up their house, didn‘t they?

156
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,584
Fixed?

157
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,309
Yes.

158
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,250
I don't know, I've never been inside.

159
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,659
Martin, isn't it true that you do not
live in Santoalla permanently?

160
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,454
No, that's not true.

161
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:40,728
Until this Saturday nobody saw you
in the village since last November

162
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,733
That's because there's nobody in the village.

163
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,736
It's only us and them.

164
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,639
They have animals at their house don't they?

165
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:51,747
They have goats...

166
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,881
They have three pigs and hens...

167
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,812
hens that get into my fields.

168
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:04,124
You don‘t really work in agriculture do you?

169
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:09,363
Our goal, when we came to this country,

170
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,196
was to build a self-sufficient farm.

171
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:18,172
It's very simple. Go up to the village right now

172
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,743
and see the fields we are working.

173
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:29,516
Have you received four letters and requests

174
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:37,423
from my clients, Martin and Margo
to be included as part of the common land?

175
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,760
Letters? No.

176
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,700
No letters? No petitions from them?

177
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,237
No letters. The mailman doesn't go to our village.

178
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:49,835
No more questions your Honor.

179
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:33,547
Good morning, dear.

180
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,123
Take five!

181
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,457
The weekend breakfast.

182
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,594
It's August 23rd.

183
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,065
They forbid me to pass through their property

184
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:55,569
and where there is not an official pass on my land...

185
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,643
they come through with a tractor.

186
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,987
All of them.

187
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,988
Everyone in my field ... everyone in my field.

188
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,082
They don't look after their animals.

189
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,623
June 6th.

190
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:53,829
Carlos, the disabled one...

191
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:56,992
spraying pesticide.

192
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:04,905
There's the mother. She also knows.

193
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,816
Where are they?

194
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:44,710
During a walk with the goats, the goats came out with a jacket

195
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,283
and inside the jacket...

196
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,848
we found some bullets.

197
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,866
This type of bullet...

198
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,863
is not from a rifle.

199
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:14,306
It appears to be from an automatic pistol of the neighbors.

200
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:24,047
Carlos, is this your jacket?

201
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:24,812
No.

202
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:25,818
Whose is it?

203
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:26,682
It's Julio's.

204
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,188
Julio's.

205
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,390
Your brother Julio?

206
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:30,192
Yeah.

207
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,418
Okay.

208
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:32,853
Take it please.

209
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,234
You're going to do it now? In front of the camera?

210
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:43,831
Martin...he was good to me.

211
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,763
But, I don't know what happened.

212
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,177
He was a little crazy.

213
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,404
Yes, he was.

214
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,941
He was always fooling around.

215
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,519
He acted like a child.

216
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:10,249
But, you need to earn respect like everyone else.

217
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:13,953
Everyone needs to know their place.

218
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:19,401
Margo was always nicer to me.

219
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,198
We don't cross paths much nowadays

220
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:28,173
but, when we do I try to talk to her

221
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,210
as I did her no harm.

222
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,246
But, I don't know.

223
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:43,491
If my husband was missing, what would I do here?

224
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,998
I wouldn't stay here by myself.

225
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,211
My husband...

226
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:42,452
my friend, my partner.

227
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,178
A stubborn man

228
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,085
who always wanted to do things his way,

229
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:53,662
but, also a man with a big heart.

230
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:58,099
I hope the day comes when we'll know what happened,

231
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,669
as not knowing is the hardest part.

232
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:30,600
Martin, I don't know where...

233
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:44,405
Martin, I don't know where your body is

234
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:49,052
but, your spirit is here with me.

235
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:12,030
Martin Verfondern disappeared on January 19th, 2010.

236
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,261
He was last seen driving his car

237
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,337
when he was coming back from shopping.

238
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,073
The police searched the hills

239
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,507
and swamps of the area over the years

240
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:26,412
but, with no success...until now

241
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:33,080
Police are investigating a car found on a mountain

242
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,587
in the municipality of A Veiga.

243
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:40,355
They think it belongs to the Dutchman
who went missing four years ago.

244
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:46,332
Authorities have closed off the place
where a helicopter investigating a brush fire

245
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:49,301
found the car that belongs to Martin Verfondern.

246
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:54,335
It was discovered burned out in a pine forest

247
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:57,639
accessible only through
mountain paths and fire lanes.

248
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,318
Human remains that might belong
to Martin Verfondern

249
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:06,750
were discovered very close to the place

250
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,681
where the Dutchman's vehicle was found.

251
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:14,688
All leads point to a homicide.

252
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:39,378
What do you think happened?

253
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,854
Well, it's a crime ... that we know for sure.

254
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:49,859
But, what happened and how it happened
is still under investigation.

255
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:53,362
What was the problem you had with your neighbors?

256
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,505
Problems with the common land. The money, like always.

257
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:57,537
The land here?

258
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,140
Yes.

259
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:03,905
The place where they found the remains and the car...

260
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,578
was it a place that Martin used to go?

261
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:09,844
No, never ever. We don't know that place.

262
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:11,744
We've never been there.

263
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:14,383
Thank you very much.

264
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:38,715
I saw nothing, so I can't say anything.

265
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,884
You had a bad relationship with him right?

266
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:41,717
No.

267
00:53:41,919 --> 00:53:43,386
He was very good at heart.

268
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:43,678
Really?

269
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,914
Really. He used to dance with me in the kitchen.

270
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,425
But, I never said anything bad about him.

271
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,926
And what do you think happened?

272
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,425
They probably had something between...

273
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,659
I can't say what it is...

274
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:04,864
between them ... down there.

275
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,836
OK, come on ... I'm done.

276
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,339
Alright ... thanks.

277
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:00,806
They came and asked questions...

278
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:11,919
but, I don't want to gossip or anything...of course.

279
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:16,218
Because you talk and then what can you do?

280
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,526
Nothing.

281
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:22,665
I saw nothing, I know nothing and that's all.

282
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,193
But, Martin...

283
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:34,134
I didn't really trust him.

284
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:39,113
l never told Margo this.

285
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:44,147
I'm going to tell you the story.

286
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:47,148
All kinds of people would come here to meet him.

287
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,720
But, I don't know what they would come for.

288
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,555
But, they used to come when...

289
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:56,733
when Margo was gone there were always people here.

290
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,766
And women...

291
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,269
but, he was a man and he could
bring over anybody he wanted to.

292
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:06,733
l mind my own business.

293
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,845
Are you scared being here after what happened?

294
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:16,145
Why should I be? If you have peace of mind
why should you be scared?

295
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,078
Of course.

296
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,916
If you do something wrong...

297
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:25,652
but if you don't ... l don't mind
the police coming here or whoever.

298
00:59:25,996 --> 00:59:26,894
Of course.

299
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:31,033
Because if you have a clean conscience you tell the truth...

300
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,632
that's the way to be.

301
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:33,936
Of course.

302
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:36,196
Because ... why would you do that?

303
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,166
No sir, I've always been very clear.

304
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,009
Things are like they are and that's it.

305
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:44,009
Why would I be hiding something? Dammit!

306
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,885
Come in, come in.

307
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,758
Alright, I have to ask you to sign a document

308
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,865
confirming that I'm giving you the remains and that's it.

309
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:39,729
It's just for evidence.

310
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,607
This is what it says,
"On this date around 11 :30 AM,

311
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,801
the anthropological forensic unit
is giving the remains

312
01:00:49,012 --> 01:00:53,108
identified as Martin Albert Verfondern
to Maria Hilligonda Pool."

313
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,881
So, please sign here.

314
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,921
And I will give you the remains now

315
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:06,353
Should I wait here?

316
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:07,787
No, come with me.

317
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,065
We should put the box in here.

318
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,232
No, up a little bit.

319
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:20,306
Oh, OK.

320
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,897
This will do then?

321
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,930
Yeah, I think that's good.

322
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:55,935
Maybe you can just put the nail up there...

323
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,201
Sounds good.

324
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:55,092
You got all the chestnuts, Carlos.

325
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,062
Where are you going with a hoe?

326
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:37,095
Well ... just start digging.

327
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:38,674
Santoalla...

328
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:45,541
Manolo always says,
"We're here until death."

329
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:50,776
His mother and father are buried here.

330
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,314
Uncles ... everybody.

331
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:08,665
So, when he dies ... his cemetery is here.

332
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:16,208
Well, I could go before Manolo.

333
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,783
And with the children, that's what hurts me the most.

334
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:29,881
I can't leave him by himself.

335
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:37,388
This one has a lot of malice.

336
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:42,393
When I get angry l can't stop.

337
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,971
And you have to look after him.

338
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,309
I want to go to The Canary Islands.

339
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,410
The Canary Islands?

340
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,550
The Canary Islands are too far, my son.

341
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:59,882
Bananas. Bananas.

342
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:09,889
If I can't take care of him, Julio will.

343
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:14,732
Julio wouldn't leave Carlos by himself.

344
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:21,674
And he won't be on his own like others.

345
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:30,316
And life goes on.

346
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,024
Do you need help?

347
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:20,299
No, it weighs nothing.

348
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:15,424
You can throw the soil on top.

349
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:23,821
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

350
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:27,799
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

351
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:31,633
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done

352
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:33,672
on earth as it is in heaven.

353
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:37,511
Take away Lord, any link of sin

354
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,408
the soul of your servant Martin

355
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,674
so in the glorious resurrection

356
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:44,512
