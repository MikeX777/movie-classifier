Listen bro,

133
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:35,256
This issue is a matter of management salaries

134
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,283
but the rest of the money we do not exist anymore.

135
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:41,312
Those people have to be paid. Suppose the debt, I'll find a way out.

136
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:44,340
You're nice talking, this place is falling.

137
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,367
See, the ceiling leaked.

138
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,394
So what, we can see the stars, right?

139
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,322
And discordant voice gramophone.

140
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:58,354
That's from my youth.

141
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,381
Hey, come here please!

142
00:13:01,307 --> 00:13:03,309
Hey James, you're late again ... / Late what?

143
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,337
Are you ready?

144
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:09,365
Because I'm going to introduce someone who is certainly rich.

145
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,293
Moneyed? / Yes.

146
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:14,320
1, 2, 3.

147
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,347
Cheese! / Cheese!

148
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,393
Let me introduce.

149
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,420
This is our new client, Mr. Victor Hawk.

150
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:44,350
And this is a fellow brother, Marcus Hawk.

151
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,378
Both men worked in the Research and Analysis Slope India ...

152
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,406
Are we again make a Hollywood movie ...

153
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:53,334
Where you can wear all white people?

154
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:58,364
Our grandfather, the English,

155
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,391
sent to India before World War II.

156
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,419
After the independence of our family stayed in India.

157
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:05,446
Start working on the Indian government.

158
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,473
So you could say I have a ...

159
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,501
Great white crossbreed in India

160
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,528
rather be Chinese.

161
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,555
Whoops!

162
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,581
So,

163
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:16,608
why did you come to us?

164
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:20,436
A few days ago, some very important files stolen from military intelligence.

165
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:22,463
According to our tracking,

166
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,490
file transport aircraft fell

167
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:27,418
when crossing the Nepal side of Mount Everest.

168
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:35,451
It occurred at 10:13 am, three days ago.

169
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:40,381
It was the same time when we hit avalanches ...

170
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:44,410
In other words, the Indian government did not want anyone to know ...

171
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:47,438
their secret files are now in neighboring countries.

172
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:51,467
That's why they have not contacted officials in Nepal.

173
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:55,396
In fact, they turned to a private rescue team to clinch their duties.

174
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,422
If you watch the news, you'll know ...

175
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,448
for the purpose of improving relations strained,

176
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:01,474
government in the Himalayan region

177
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:04,502
currently planning to meet in Kathmandu.

178
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:07,428
The meeting will be scheduled 65 hours from now.

179
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:11,456
The political situation is very difficult,

180
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,482
if not treated immediately.

181
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,509
The documents are missing,

182
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,535
very very important.

183
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,461
Because it involves direct multilateral relations.

184
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:23,488
Wherein the crash?

185
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,522
Death Zone ...

186
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:39,452
Last Transmission air through the tool ELT

187
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:41,478
are in the Zone of Death,

188
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:44,506
approximately 8700 meters above sea level,

189
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,534
near the summit. / You realize even in good weather,

190
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:53,462
rescue helicopter could not reach an altitude of 6000 meters above sea level.

191
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,488
72 hours, in the Death Zone,

192
00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:57,515
zero chance of survival.

193
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,541
That's right. / Well this is why we come to you.

194
00:15:59,565 --> 00:16:02,467
You guys are experts in their field.

195
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,493
Suppose we could,

196
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:07,521
why we want to take? You're going to slow us down.

197
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,547
My sister is not here to answer your question,

198
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:14,475
but tell to settle this!

199
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,502
Boss, when we will put an end to this meeting?

200
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:19,529
We do not have to take this job, something feels awkward.

201
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,555
Yeah, you know what? I'm having a pretty fun day.

202
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,581
I just try your luck on the gaming tables.

203
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:26,508
Anyway thank you friends. / I'm sorry, this will not work.

204
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,534
We wish you luck.

205
00:16:28,558 --> 00:16:31,561
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

206
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:36,590
1 dollar ... one dollar!

207
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,521
1 dollar.

208
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,548
If you take us there,

209
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,577
we will pay half a million dollars.

210
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:55,605
Listen bro, this is really a good chance.

211
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,532
Although you do not like the idea, at least listen to the opinions of others.

212
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:03,561
Now I feel a little challenge there would be no harm.

213
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:08,590
Chairman, you are decided, I adherents alone.

214
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:25,631
The business we are saving lives. We are not equipped with political affairs.

215
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,558
Yeah, but even though we are well known, we are again heavily indebted.

216
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,586
If we go on like this, soon the team will disband.

217
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:47,625
Political tensions are short tonight ...

218
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,652
with increased military presence on both sides of the border.

219
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:54,580
Many feared this action could trigger a war area.

220
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,608
Peace meeting scheduled with 3 days,

221
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,634
the officials agreed to meet at the Conference,

222
00:18:00,658 --> 00:18:02,660
hoping to prevent a wider impact.

223
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,589
Tashi injured. We are understaffed.

224
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:11,617
What about the young girl?

225
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:14,644
Suya shown on recordings of the mission,

226
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:17,671
he was quite remarkable. / Never mind that.

227
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,697
He was not a member of Team Wings.

228
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:25,627
You will not find a qualified person

229
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:27,653
and familiar with the Death Zone like the girl?

230
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:31,681
Well, this file. Perhaps you change your mind.

231
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,713
"May 18, 2014, the last survivor"

232
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,696
Hey, Kapten Jiang ...

233
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,722
finally there are people who can reach the bird.

234
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,749
She'd break his record of your daughter.

235
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:49,779
Who? / I do not know,

236
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:52,706
I've never seen him before.

237
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,734
Da says go towards Everest.

238
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:09,771
BANDARA TRIBHUVAN

239
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:46,892
How did you find me, Chief?

240
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:50,820
Just a coincidence. I'm just passing through.

241
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,849
Not good at lying.

242
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,876
What?

243
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,908
I want to go back to Tim Wings, without pay.

244
00:22:11,837 --> 00:22:16,842
I've read the incident report, 2014.

245
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:19,869
You think I do not know the real motives

246
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,896
to join the rescue team?

247
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:27,925
Maybe before no one was willing,

248
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,852
but there must be people who say honest with you.

249
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:32,878
If you're looking for someone,

250
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,905
already 5 years!

251
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,931
No one knows where ...

252
00:22:38,956 --> 00:22:40,958
The wind threw her body.

253
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:43,885
Even if you find him, it's just simply ...

254
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,911
mere corpse!

255
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,953
I understand that you think

256
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:05,979
I have gone mad ...

257
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:08,906
I is not logical.

258
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,934
If I could think clearly,

259
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,961
I could have packed up and left,

260
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:18,988
leaving all the ice and snow,

261
00:23:19,012 --> 00:23:21,915
back to China and find a decent job, marries a normal man,

262
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,944
have children,

263
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:28,970
take care of housework,

264
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:30,996
and live in peace

265
00:23:32,922 --> 00:23:34,924
like everyone else.

266
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:37,951
However ...

267
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:41,979
not so easy to forget about the people close to you

268
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,006
and forget everything as if nothing ever happened.

269
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:47,933
I do not care what others,

270
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:51,961
I will not leave him alone there.

271
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:55,989
You know the first thing about leaving the people close to you up there!

272
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:01,018
If you assume I did not follow the protocol properly,

273
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,945
I promise to stick to start now!

274
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:07,973
If you still perceive me less worthy,

275
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:09,999
I will keep trying until you ... / Enough.

276
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:19,032
North star cluster, Cygnus, visible tonight,

277
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:22,059
means there are persistent fight.

278
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,085
Turns out I was right.

279
00:24:29,014 --> 00:24:31,016
Go back to sleep.

280
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:39,048
We're leaving tomorrow morning at 6 o'clock.

281
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:51,084
And do not forget this ...

282
00:24:57,014 --> 00:25:00,017
Chairman, you will not regret it!

283
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,046
You do not heal you? Shouts nights like this!

284
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,072
Get lost you! / Sorry.

285
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:17,106
"PEMULA (NOOB)"

286
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,034
{\an9}broth3rmax

287
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:35,072
Get rid of all unnecessary James, including the crane machine.

288
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:38,099
Are you sure, Chief?

289
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:40,125
The more light the higher flying.

290
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,053
BANDARA HELI KATHMANDU

291
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,083
Han, activate the procedure, be prepared to take off.

292
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:52,109
Understandably.

293
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,153
Sorry...

294
00:26:12,177 --> 00:26:14,179
Sorry...

295
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:18,107
Why late? Team Wings ...

296
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:20,133
no special treatment just because you're a woman.

297
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:24,161
I warn you, do not cry over to someday start no trouble!

298
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:26,187
Ready, Chief!

299
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:29,114
Hey, noob!

300
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,140
James would say something.

301
00:26:31,164 --> 00:26:34,167
You're talking what, stupid clown? / He's been practicing all night.

302
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:43,200
Aah, okay okay ... that ...

303
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:48,129
You're really beautiful...

304
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:52,157
thanks. / But once ...

305
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,183
construction!

306
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:18,231
Hello, Victor.

307
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,161
Xiaodaizi.

308
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,194
Team Wings, take off.

309
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:42,227
Caution in the air. / Be Careful...

310
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:10,279
Biking to Camp III cut off by avalanches,

311
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:13,206
we have to make the rope bridge itself.

312
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:19,236
This is it.

313
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,282
Why he could sleep when this be?

314
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:45,310
You know, he used to be called the chairman of the "devil Himalaya"

315
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:10,259
Bos, the air begins to thin.

316
00:29:10,283 --> 00:29:12,285
Only so far helicopter arriving.

317
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:14,311
Lower us here.

318
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,338
Lower helicopters in Lobuche, and wait there Be there!

319
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:19,364
Understandably.

320
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:24,293
Wings team, there is an increase in the peak of the storm, be careful up there.

321
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:27,320
I do not need to be careful, I ''m not climbing.

322
00:29:27,344 --> 00:29:30,347
Han, do nyombong!

323
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:46,287
Above Base Camp 5700 meters

324
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:55,320
We have two satellite phones, I take one,

325
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:57,346
only brought Victor.

326
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:02,375
Understandably, Captain. / I'll call again when up to Camp III, so.

327
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:08,405
Now remember, you all carry GPS devices,

328
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:11,332
The tool shows the fall of the signal plane.

329
00:30:11,356 --> 00:30:15,360
We must find the missing plane before the battery runs out.

330
00:30:16,385 --> 00:30:18,387
We have less than 48 hours.

331
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:03,456
Good, let's go!

332
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:12,389
Come on!

333
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,426
Be Careful!

334
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,452
Come on, come on, pull!

335
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:42,491
You do not what?

336
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,419
Not at all.

337
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:56,453
Hey, you're next.

338
00:32:12,493 --> 00:32:14,495
Noob, notice your breathing pattern

339
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,523
and the rhythm of climbing.

340
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,449
Your ways too wide and too quick breath.

341
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:24,477
It makes you more easily tired.

342
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:28,506
Climbing it like yoga,

343
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,535
increasingly sluggish movement, much more can be achieved.

344
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,461
Try one after another if you can.

345
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:44,493
This is not a race, Noob.

346
00:33:01,535 --> 00:33:04,538
{\an1}Kamp III, 7158 meter

347
00:33:04,562 --> 00:33:07,565
Captain, I've check the cigarette Trinidad you ask.

348
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:11,492
It's expensive brands with exclusive supply,

349
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,521
average, rather than the brand choice of government officials.

350
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:20,550
But it's the same kuselidiki colleagues Indiaku military contacts.

351
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:23,577
They sure are

352
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,605
sent two agents named Victor and Marcus.

353
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:29,631
All right, let me know if any other info.

354
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:31,657
Keep in touch. / Well.

355
00:33:58,608 --> 00:34:01,611
{\an1}Lobuche, 4930 meter

356
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:11,645
Whose is this?

357
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:15,573
Code Morse?

358
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,600
Noob!

359
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,628
Aw, I think he's already sold!

360
00:34:55,685 --> 00:34:57,687
I am back.

361
00:36:23,697 --> 00:36:25,699
What will we prepare the rope bridge now?

362
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:28,726
You do not need to go. James and I could take care of his rope.

363
00:36:30,752 --> 00:36:32,754
Are you sure?

364
00:36:35,781 --> 00:36:37,783
Without your mess,

365
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:39,809
we can move faster.

366
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:11,765
2030?

367
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:21,799
How do you know? / Morse Code is part of mandatory training for rescuers, remember?

368
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,835
It's a game that often we play.

369
00:37:36,762 --> 00:37:38,764
Her name Summer.

370
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:44,794
We formed a perfect climbing team.

371
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:51,825
2 people, complementary

372
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,853
as if we mirrored each other.

373
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:08,790
Everest was the final challenge in the 14 thousands of our adventure.

374
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,822
One day we climb past 5 years,

375
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:20,850
a few hundred meters from the summit, in the Death Zone,

376
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:24,878
unexpected weather change ...

377
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,950
Rescuers said she was too far a hike

378
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,877
they left it on the mountain that day

379
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:19,905
That's the last day all saw him.

380
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:31,941
His last words to me via morse code ...

381
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,969
2030...

382
00:39:36,894 --> 00:39:38,896
Just figure it is what he said to me.

383
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,923
What would he say?

384
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:57,963
I searched all associated with that number.

385
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:03,993
But there was no result.

386
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,923
I did not give up looking for him.

387
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:16,954
Do not you lose everything.

388
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:23,985
Sometimes time will erase all the memories.

389
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,012
He is only one part of you,

390
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,942
but...

391
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,969
forget not the same as giving up.

392
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:52,009
Hey Chief, are you ready to go?

393
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,041
Maybe...

394
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:03,969
not only that she wanted to say.

395
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:23,012
What is this?

396
00:41:23,036 --> 00:41:25,038
Of course, a secret.

397
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:29,066
And the secret will be revealed later during the end of the course.

398
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:40,001
Xiaodaizi. Sorry, I'm not pro ... mak ... sud ...

399
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:42,027
Did not mean it.

400
00:41:43,052 --> 00:41:47,056
Yes, I did not mean it. / Well, forgive.

What is Tashi?

418
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,167
I got a phone call from a military friend, he said ...

419
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:09,094
Victor and Marcus who come to us ... they were ...

420

What? Who is a liar?

00:43:19,152 --> 00:43:21,154
Hey, your cigarettes behind.

Marcus!

424
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:31,136
Hey, your brother called.

425
00:43:36,165 --> 00:43:38,167
He did not know his name.

426
00:43:38,191 --> 00:43:40,193
Mr. Rum Head. (stupid)

427
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,223
Victor and Marcus are genuine, their bodies ...

428
00:43:47,148 --> 00:43:49,150
met in Kathmandu recently!

429
00:43:49,174 --> 00:43:52,177
Time of death was estimated to be 2 days ago ...

430
00:43:53,202 --> 00:43:55,204
I give them a physical description of two men with us ...

431
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:58,231
Fellow my contacts send their photos ...

432
00:43:58,255 --> 00:44:01,158
and they could find two people that is almost similar.

433
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:04,185
Victor and Marcus we were ...

434
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:06,211
they are cheaters who work ...

435
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:10,239
the biggest arms dealer in the Himalayan region.

436
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:13,166
They membayakan his life to have a confidential document ...

437
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,193

438
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,222
Halo?

439
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:23,248
Halo?

440
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:25,274
Tashi ...

441
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:36,209
Tashi ...

442
00:45:20,277 --> 00:45:22,279
Very humiliating.

443
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,306
I was so expect a lot of you.

444
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:41,246
Sana take-ice ax, ropes and GPS girls,

445
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,273
we must not waste it all.

446
00:46:41,354 --> 00:46:43,356
This is me.

447
00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:48,385
Already I convinced my team to bring disposable helicopter ride,

448
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:51,312
killing them is not part of the deal!

449
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:53,338
We get caught by them, this is indeed necessary.

450
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:56,365
You do not understand?

451
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:58,391
Team captain Jiang was like family.

452
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,417
They were siblings.

453
00:47:02,343 --> 00:47:06,347
I have long heard when Suya are those who traffic children organ.

454
00:47:07,372 --> 00:47:09,374
What is not the case?

455
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,407
Okay,

456
00:47:18,431 --> 00:47:20,433

457
00:48:18,415 --> 00:48:20,417

Nemu something? / No, are you?

468
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,538
Chairman?

469
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:20,465
Captain,

470
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:22,491
I understand if a lost your team while on duty.

471
00:49:22,516 --> 00:49:24,518
I know it's almost morning.

472
00:49:25,543 --> 00:49:28,546
But finding him is not our priority. How? At least 30 hours ahead.

473

You're nice talking, huh? Not anggotamu that are out there!

474
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:33,498

Now what if he's not impossible to climb out of here ...

480

We continue the journey. / Chairman!

I left my cell phone here.

482

When he gets back, can catch up with us as soon as possible.

483
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:05,547
Understandably.

484
00:50:09,575 --> 00:50:11,577
If anything happens, you know what to do.

Now I'm going to camp II to meet him.

Well, cowboy, will immediately tell you to meet the rescue team in camp II.

514
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:29,094
Be careful there, and take care of Xiaodaizi when you met him, yes?

515
00:58:29,118 --> 00:58:31,120
Change.

516
00:58:31,144 --> 00:58:34,047
Understandably, we will wait for the rescue team there.

517
00:58:35,072 --> 00:58:37,074

Fast-forward, our time is less than 24 hours.

521
00:59:31,124 --> 00:59:33,126
Stay a little longer.

522
00:59:35,152 --> 00:59:38,155

523
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,132

524
01:00:40,165 --> 01:00:42,167
Caution!

525
01:00:42,191 --> 01:00:44,193
Do not come close!

526
01:00:45,218 --> 01:00:47,220
Hey!

527
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:13,330
There was a problem at the signal, we kept going.

528
01:02:15,256 --> 01:02:18,259
If we can not contact them, we have to go down.

529

How?

536
01:02:49,382 --> 01:02:52,285
Bad weather interfere with GPS signals.

537
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:55,312
But Suya said he could put a call through them.

538
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:58,339
That's great news.

539
01:02:58,363 --> 01:03:00,365
Yeah, her.

540
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:17,306
If we are not to kill women cowboy!

541
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:20,333
Hey, Rum Head.

542
01:03:20,357 --> 01:03:22,359
I do not see you 2 days, and you ...

543
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:27,388

Needless to say thanks, I'm here just want to see the sunrise.

550
01:06:14,524 --> 01:06:18,528
He will send a rescue team as soon as possible,

551
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:20,554
to find us.

552
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:23,581
However ...

553
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:26,508
not Suya which introduced Marcus and Victor on us?

554
01:06:26,532 --> 01:06:28,534
You suspect Suya?

555
01:06:32,562 --> 01:06:35,565
It is impossible. We've long known him.

556
01:06:38,592 --> 01:06:41,595
Before you hit the lungs coughs,

557
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:43,621
must kuobati you as best I could ...

558
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:47,549
Match IV, 7906 meters

559
01:06:55,581 --> 01:06:57,583
It's just a fire.

560
01:06:57,607 --> 01:06:59,609
Pain will always be with you.

561
01:07:02,536 --> 01:07:04,538
Your scar?

562
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,570
Our nation was born in the Himalayas Caucasians.

563
01:07:13,595 --> 01:07:16,598
We are not English or local residents.

564
01:07:16,622 --> 01:07:18,624
Just ...

565
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:21,551
mulatto, struggling to survive.

566
01:07:22,576 --> 01:07:25,579
My sister and I learned early in life ... is to kill or be killed.

567
01:07:25,603 --> 01:07:28,606
But the strong always prey on the weak.

568
01:07:29,631 --> 01:07:32,634
From what I know, at one point you were not much different.

569
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:35,561
Huh? What do you mean?

570
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:39,589
From what I heard, once you people are often "end justifies the means'.

571
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:44,618
Nobody can mess with ...

572
01:07:44,642 --> 01:07:47,645
what do they call you, the devil Himalaya?

573
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,572
The devil was dead.

574
01:07:51,597 --> 01:07:53,599
Because your daughter?

575
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:57,627
Are you talking about?

576
01:07:57,651 --> 01:08:01,655
From what I hear, Xiaodaizi not your first pupil ...

577
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,682
before him, you have to train your daughter, right?

578
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,708
It was a mistake.

579
01:08:06,732 --> 01:08:09,635
Why? I heard she received many awards as a climber ...

580
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:10,660
Diam!

581
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,686
I do not want to discuss it!

582
01:08:16,614 --> 01:08:18,616
Take a break.

583
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:27,649
Do not believe the boss who gives it to you.

584
01:08:28,674 --> 01:08:30,676
Spare astrolabe was ...

585
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,702
daughter thinks it's like a precious treasure.

586
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:35,629
He had the talent.

587
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,655
But the boss was never satisfied.

588
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,682
She hoped her daughter could be his successor

589
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,710
and surpasses him.

590
01:08:46,636 --> 01:08:50,640
Until one day, his daughter go hiking alone

591
01:08:51,665 --> 01:08:53,667
in a challenge to the top

592
01:08:54,692 --> 01:08:56,694
but he failed to return.

593
01:09:02,724 --> 01:09:05,727
But, this is for what?

594
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:07,753
I just knew that...

595
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:09,779
This kind of tool

596
01:09:09,803 --> 01:09:12,706
if you're pointing direction of the coordinates in the sky,

597
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:14,732
This tool will show some kind of constellations.

598
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:17,659
Try.

599
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:34,700
2030...

600
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:46,736
What exactly do you want to say?

601
01:10:30,804 --> 01:10:32,806
Because the first large-ambassador has arrived,

602
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:35,833
Kathmandu streets so lively.

603
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:39,761
Because many are hoping this conference will bring improvements forever ...

604
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:42,788
in the multilateral relations between the regions of the Himalayas.

605
01:10:43,813 --> 01:10:46,816
However, there are also pessimistic about the success short of expectations

606
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:50,844
given the long history of conflict and complicated this region.

607
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:54,772
Only in 6 hours, the talks will start in tension.

608
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:56,798
The world will be watching.

609
01:11:08,834 --> 01:11:10,836
Be Careful!

610
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:12,862
Here it is, all our friends are here.

611
01:11:12,886 --> 01:11:14,888
More than just family.

612
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,818
Perhaps you change your mind, you can contact us by Suya anytime.

613
01:11:21,843 --> 01:11:23,845
If Suya did help them ...

614
01:11:25,871 --> 01:11:28,874
then nobody came to save us.

615
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:30,900
You should have gone yesterday.

616
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:39,833
I'll make you something to eat.

617
01:11:49,867 --> 01:11:51,869
I've been there.

618
01:12:14,916 --> 01:12:17,919
Noob, you stupid or what?

619
01:12:26,852 --> 01:12:29,855
God knows what happened to the Boss,

620
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:34,884
and I was injured.

621
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:39,913
Between the two of us,

622
01:12:39,937 --> 01:12:42,940
only one person who might be able to ...

623
01:12:44,866 --> 01:12:46,868
managed to get off safely.

624
01:12:52,898 --> 01:12:54,900
Look, you're supposed to have said,

625
01:12:55,925 --> 01:12:57,927
"Wait for me, I will go down looking for help."

626
01:13:01,955 --> 01:13:03,957
Then I would say,

627
01:13:03,981 --> 01:13:05,983
"baiklah."

628
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,009
"Bagus."

629
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:10,941
But we both know

630
01:13:11,932 --> 01:13:13,934
this is what happens.

631
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,961
No one is hurt.

632
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,997
Listen to me...

633
01:13:29,922 --> 01:13:32,925
you have to leave me here.

634
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,952
There is no other way!

635
01:13:55,996 --> 01:13:57,998
Maybe ... there are other ways.

636
01:13:59,023 --> 01:14:02,026
You're good at wearing the equipment, right?

637
01:14:25,974 --> 01:14:28,977
What are you doing? / The blizzard will still come.

638
01:14:29,001 --> 01:14:32,004
Bring your equipment, we will begin to descend the mountain.

639
01:14:32,028 --> 01:14:35,031
Our distance with the death zone just hours.

640
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:38,058
If we go back, we will lose the chance of finding that plane!

641
01:14:38,082 --> 01:14:40,084
As I said yesterday,

642
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,110
if the weather gets worse

643
01:14:42,134 --> 01:14:45,037
and we still can not contact my team,

644
01:14:45,061 --> 01:14:48,064
we will go down and start the rescue.

645
01:14:48,088 --> 01:14:50,090
This is more important than your document.

646
01:14:55,019 --> 01:14:56,020
It works. / Good.

647
01:14:56,044 --> 01:14:58,046
Oh, my God,

648
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:02,074
you're a student engineer kayak worst ever.

649
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:04,100
That's why I became a mountaineer.

650
01:15:07,027 --> 01:15:09,029
The location of the crash is still sending the signal.

651
01:15:09,053 --> 01:15:11,055
Possibilities can be reached within half a day.

652
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:14,082
If we're lucky,

653
01:15:14,106 --> 01:15:16,108
radio equipment on the plane that crashed was still functioning.

654
01:15:16,132 --> 01:15:18,134
We can call the rescue team.

655
01:15:19,059 --> 01:15:22,062
I hire you to take us to that plane!

656
01:15:22,086 --> 01:15:24,088
Own brother also lost!

657
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:28,116
Will not let anyone deter goals, although it was my own brother.

658
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:31,043
Captain!

659
01:15:31,067 --> 01:15:33,069
Why is this to you?

660
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:36,096
You were a top climber, I thought was great, I admire you.

661
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:39,123
Now look at you, you're just a man ... full of doubts.

662
01:15:40,048 --> 01:15:44,052
What is your daughter's accident ... this makes you weak?

663
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,083
If we go down now, what about the reputation of business?

664
01:15:52,108 --> 01:15:54,110
What an asshole!

665
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:56,136
You do not understand too huh?

666
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,162
Business can walk alone.

667
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,188
But the matter of saving people is not so.

668
01:16:00,212 --> 01:16:03,115
Many lives are at stake.

669
01:16:03,139 --> 01:16:06,142
Do you think only state security,

670
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:10,070
but what does it mean if you do not save people close to you?

671
01:16:12,096 --> 01:16:14,098
Oxygen! Go after!

672
01:16:58,166 --> 01:17:00,168
Thank you friends, I owe you my life.

673
01:17:11,203 --> 01:17:15,207
You said the girl was missing.

674
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:17,233
You are lying!

675
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:19,259
You are lying!

676
01:17:20,184 --> 01:17:23,187
You want to kill me? Well, kill me.

677
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:25,213
But then you'll never see your beloved disciples again.

678
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:29,241
First you have to kill your daughter, now you kill your pupils.

679
01:17:30,166 --> 01:17:32,168
Enjoy the guilt.

680
01:17:32,192 --> 01:17:36,196
Where is he? / If you drive to the crash site, I'll tell you where he is.

681
01:17:37,221 --> 01:17:40,224
Is this not a fair bargain?

682
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:59,267
That Morse code?

683
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:09,201
Why are you doing this?

684
01:18:09,225 --> 01:18:11,227
You would not understand.

685
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:14,254
Since we were little, we were treated like a bum.

686
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:19,283
The only way to be respected is money, then we are looking for an advantage in the war.

687
01:18:19,307 --> 01:18:23,211
Now the monsters, they have destroyed us, and now want peace?

688
01:18:24,236 --> 01:18:26,238
Peace Fuck them!

689
01:18:37,273 --> 01:18:40,276
How do I know if my team is still alive?

690
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:43,303
You do not know.

691
01:18:43,327 --> 01:18:45,329
But there is one chance.

692
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:48,256
You know the captain, life is like a game of Russian roulette.

693
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,282
Let's play, how?

694
01:18:50,306 --> 01:18:53,309
Only this is our chance.

695
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:58,238
Within a few days ago,

696
01:18:59,263 --> 01:19:01,265
we lost a lot of people.

697
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:04,292
From this moment,

698
01:19:04,316 --> 01:19:07,319
I will never forsake or Chairman.

699
01:19:08,344 --> 01:19:10,346
I will not leave anyone again.

700
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:19,379
You're crazy.

701
01:19:19,403 --> 01:19:21,405
This is really crazy!

702
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:36,344
Hey skipper, make sure the rope tightly bound.

703
01:19:36,368 --> 01:19:38,370
I do not like it when missed.

704
01:19:52,308 --> 01:19:54,310
Noob...

705
01:19:58,338 --> 01:20:00,340
What you say I have

706
01:20:00,364 --> 01:20:02,366
"Goddess of Luck" mu?

707
01:20:05,393 --> 01:20:07,395
Wait for me back.

708
01:20:45,357 --> 01:20:47,359
We've been road for hours.

709
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:50,386
I think we walk in circles!

710
01:20:51,411 --> 01:20:56,416
In this bad weather did not know where the left-right.

711
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,443
Do not mess with, Captain!

712
01:20:59,467 --> 01:21:01,469
Why do we take a shortcut instead?

713
01:21:01,493 --> 01:21:02,494
Ah, a shortcut.

714
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:06,422
But only a few people in this world that can be managed via that route.

715
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:09,449
You want to try it?

716
01:21:22,386 --> 01:21:24,388
It is enough! I'm tired of you!

717
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:26,414
You think I do not know what you want?

718
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:31,443
From here, I can get to the plane itself without you.

719
01:21:37,473 --> 01:21:39,475
Frozen Morning?

720
01:23:24,505 --> 01:23:26,507
You can not catch her ...

721
01:23:29,534 --> 01:23:31,536
Nothing can!

722
01:23:38,567 --> 01:23:40,569
Chairman!

723
01:23:53,606 --> 01:23:55,608
Noob...

724
01:23:55,632 --> 01:23:58,635
breath and keep your step.

725
01:24:01,562 --> 01:24:03,564
Climb it like yoga ...

726
01:24:04,589 --> 01:24:09,594
increasingly slow you move, the more far can you accomplish.

727
01:24:47,656 --> 01:24:50,659
Death Zone

728
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:24,777
Victor and Marcus we have ...

729
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:27,704
working for the biggest arms dealer in the Himalayan region.

730
01:26:27,728 --> 01:26:30,731
They endanger his life for the sake of getting confidential documents ...

731
01:26:30,755 --> 01:26:35,760
not to menghantikan war, they want to spark a war ...

732
01:27:50,859 --> 01:27:53,862
Peak, 8848 meters

733
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:20,813
Ya ya ya ...

734
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,840
is not this a surprise!

735
01:28:24,865 --> 01:28:28,869
All your team members are dead, you lose everything.

736
01:28:29,894 --> 01:28:32,897
But you survive here, still trying to stop me?

737
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:35,824
Are you going crazy?

738
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:39,852
Not .. do not ... do!

739
01:28:41,878 --> 01:28:42,879
Okay...

740
01:28:42,903 --> 01:28:45,906
Enough, enough!

741
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:48,833
Let us stop, okay?

742
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:51,860
Everything in life has a price.

743
01:28:52,885 --> 01:28:54,887
... Let's make a deal, how?

744
01:28:56,913 --> 01:28:58,915
Submit the document in your hands ... / I do not like you.

745
01:29:00,841 --> 01:29:02,843
All that you do for yourself.

746
01:29:03,868 --> 01:29:05,870
But people in my life have taught ...

747
01:29:05,894 --> 01:29:07,896
we can be more than that.

748
01:29:08,921 --> 01:29:11,924
You want ... just money.

749
01:29:11,948 --> 01:29:14,951
Ambition, confession ...

750
01:29:15,876 --> 01:29:17,878
everything is in here!

751
01:29:19,904 --> 01:29:21,906
Do not! You're a crazy bitch!

752
01:30:25,994 --> 01:30:27,996
Chairman!

753
01:31:07,059 --> 01:31:09,061
Chairman...

754
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:16,993
You should ...

755
01:31:17,017 --> 01:31:19,019
reduce weight ...

756
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:28,052
Hurry up!

757
01:31:30,078 --> 01:31:32,080
Chairman, what are you doing?

758
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:50,022
Holdfast, Chief!

759
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,061
Holdfast!

760
01:32:08,088 --> 01:32:10,090
Chairman, holdfast!

761
01:32:13,117 --> 01:32:15,119
Meaning of Cygnus is ...

762
01:32:16,044 --> 01:32:18,046
each end ...

763
01:32:19,071 --> 01:32:21,073
there is a new beginning.

764
01:32:30,106 --> 01:32:32,108
No...

765
01:32:42,142 --> 01:32:44,144
Chairman...

766
01:33:04,088 --> 01:33:06,090
It's over ... I have this time

767
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:12,120
I guess I'll never see another sunrise ...

768
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:46,418
OXYGEN: 0

769
01:37:52,448 --> 01:37:54,450
No...

770
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:15,455
Nepal Police, what is your emergency?

771
01:40:00,525 --> 01:40:02,527
It's the police, give it up!

772
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:44,492
KATHMANDU HOSPITAL

773
01:40:44,617 --> 01:40:45,618
thanks.

774
01:40:45,642 --> 01:40:48,645
I contacted the rescue services and the police.

775
01:40:48,669 --> 01:40:52,573
They said there was an unknown person called and told them about me.

776
01:40:52,597 --> 01:40:55,600
I told them that definitely Xiaodaizi,

777
01:40:55,624 --> 01:40:58,627
but they did not find him up there ...

778
01:40:59,652 --> 01:41:03,656
and he disappeared from the records of departure Wings Team.

779
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:06,583
As if he had never existed.

780
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:09,610
Himalaya conference has been conducted successfully.

781
01:41:09,634 --> 01:41:14,639
Signatory to this historic peace agreement ushered in a new era of multi-national ...

782
01:41:39,688 --> 01:41:44,693
Peace ... peace ...

783
01:43:52,745 --> 01:43:54,747
Hey, cowboy!

784
01:44:02,779 --> 01:44:04,781
What are you doing here want to see another sunrise?
