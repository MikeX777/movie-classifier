1
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:38,659
June.

2
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:41,615
Look who's here, Sis.

3
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,542
Why, Hazel Cousins.
- Hello, June.

4
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:47,640
How you been, you old so-and-so?

5
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:50,903
Gosh, it's good to see you.

6
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,209
Tell me, do you see
any of the old crowd?

7
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:55,649
You know, the dear old Kappas?
- No, I don't get around much.

8
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,073
I've been taking a motor
trip with a friend.

9
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:01,062
And when I saw you were here,
I simply had to come in and say hello.

10
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,395
That's swell.

11
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:05,474
Come on, snap into it, honey.
We're on next. I'll be right back.

12
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:11,895
What's the matter, June?

13
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:13,631
I'll have to tell you.

14
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,094
I've got to tell somebody,
to get it out of my head.

15
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,113
Hazel.

16
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,205
I shouldn't go on with this act.

17
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:22,983
I'm afraid.

18
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:24,653
Afraid? Of what?

19
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,527
Something that's been on my
mind for a long time now.

20
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:29,624
It didn't bother me much at first.

21
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,309
Now, it's driving me ..

22
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,527
No .. no, I can't go on.

23
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,340
What's the matter? What's happened?

24
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,868
Do you remember that round-robin letter
we all sent each other?          - Yes.

25
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:42,703
The letter mentioned ..

26
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:46,327
How miraculous a Swami in New York was
in predicting what would happen to us.

27
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:49,357
So you sent for your horoscope?
- Did you, too?

28
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:53,224
Well, he sent us three
letters, warning us.

29
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:55,258
He didn't tell my sister.

30
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,023
Hazel .. he said something terrible
was going to happen to one of us.

31
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,844
An accident. And another
one of us would go ..

32
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,793
Oh no, I ..

33
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,832
It can't go on. Way up there.

34
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,453
I know I'm afraid.

35
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:10,720
Yoo-hoo!

36
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,253
Come on, we're on.

37
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,573
Goodbye.

38
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:36,422
Ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,284
I take great pleasure.

40
00:04:39,787 --> 00:04:41,404
In introducing to you.

41
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,249
The marvel .. of the
Joe E Marvel circus:

42
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:49,304
The Raskob sisters!

43
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:00,368
And now .. the Raskob sisters.

44
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,087
Will do their world-famous <i>double twist</i>!

45
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:06,243
Done <i>without</i> a net.

46
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,495
The most breath-taking.

47
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,618
Death-defying aerial feat.

48
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:16,032
That this .. or in my opinion,
ladies and gentlemen ..

49
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:19,786
Any generation .. will ever see.

50
00:07:23,516 --> 00:07:25,394
I've worked this horoscope out 5 times.

51
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:29,672
It predicts great happiness.

52
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,380
But still I'm afraid to send it.

53
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:34,823
Why, Swami?

54
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,443
Because I was fatally
wrong about June Raskob.

55
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,742
Her future was as happy as this one.

56
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:41,877
A week after I wrote her.

57
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,508
Her sister was dead and she was insane.

58
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:48,134
You must send it.
- Have I ..?

59
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:51,159
Have I lost the power
to divine the stars?

60
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:54,219
No, Swami.

61
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,388
But you must send the letter.

62
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,129
For the sake of the 12 women who wrote a
round-robin asking for their horoscopes.

63
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:05,755
They were schoolgirls together.

64
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:09,017
Their lives formed one chain of destiny.

65
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:12,811
Twelve women who believe.

66
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,424
Don't destroy their faith in the occult.

67
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:21,109
Swami.

68
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,630
What is in that brain of yours?

69
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:28,433
Your eyes.

70
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,693
We've met before. Of that, I'm certain.

71
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:35,571
Not on this earth.

72
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:39,855
Were we lovers in another
incarnation, Swami?

73
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:42,321
Tell me.

74
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,366
Couldn't you learn by ..

75
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:54,231
Casting my horoscope?

76
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:02,462
I have cast it.

77
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,747
To see if the heavens
could explain your ..

78
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:07,762
Your effect on me.

79
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,311
Yes?
- Please don't make me tell you.

80
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,808
Tell me.

81
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:32,943
It is death.

82
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,531
I read for you.

83
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,954
Aren't we all to die?
- But you, not pleasantly.

84
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:40,842
Oh, the thought it too horrible.

85
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:42,832
Your body.

86
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:45,507
Mangled like that.
- How?

87
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,440
An accident, the stars say.

88
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:51,475
A railroad .. perhaps.

89
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,392
How strange.

90
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:00,129
So, are you to die like that, too?

91
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:03,890
Don't look at me that way.

92
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:06,201
Don't look at me like that.

93
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:18,897
You are very tired, Swami.

94
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:28,422
Sleep is so sweet.

95
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,106
Hazel!

96
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,784
We're playing Tarzan.

97
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:07,010
And Ann says I can't climb trees.

98
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,873
But Tarzan did, Mother. So why can't I?

99
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,840
Los Angeles calling
Mrs Helen Frye in New York.

100
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:14,756
Mrs Helen Frye?

101
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,741
Yes.

102
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,932
Hello .. hello, Helen?

103
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:20,107
Why, Laura Stanhope.

104
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,679
It's grand to hear you again.

105
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:24,328
What's up?

106
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:26,808
Oh.

107
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,243
Oh yes.

108
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:30,766
His prediction came true.

109
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:32,931
Oh but dear, that's just a coincidence.

110
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:35,135
May going like that and then Hazel.

111
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,896
We mustn't believe in it, Helen.

112
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,111
I'm going to put a stop
to it. Do you hear?

113
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:41,662
Listen.

114
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,821
Grace Coombs lives out here.

115
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:47,204
And Jo Turner is going to stop
off on her way back from Hawaii.

116
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,350
Helen, you try to come out.

117
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:52,150
Oh .. oh, I'd love to Laura but ..

118
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:55,150
George has been so wretched since ..

119
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,623
Since the baby left us.

120
00:13:59,157 --> 00:14:01,647
I don't think I ..
- But the trip will do you good.

121
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:05,629
We'll laugh those fool horoscopes
right out of our heads.

122
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:08,936
Alright. Let me know.

123
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:11,047
Goodbye.

124
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:16,225
Can I Mother, in my old clothes?

125
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:20,153
Yes, darling. You can climb
the apple tree in your own yard.

126
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:21,506
Okay.

127
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,206
Oh, hello Grace.

128
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:25,564
How are you?

129
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,152
Come on, sit down.

130
00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:30,671
Oh, another one of those messages?
- Yes.

131
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,584
Grace .. if you don't stop
selling your soul to the devil ..

132
00:14:33,684 --> 00:14:35,805
By believing in those
foolish horoscopes.

133
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,117
What about May?

134
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,341
And Hazel <i>is</i> in jail.

135
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:40,977
It's pitiful, yes.

136
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,256
But the result of natural causes.

137
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:48,037
And belief in anything else
is believing in .. magic.

138
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,026
But Laura.

139
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,202
And you'd help the rest
of us Grace, if you'd hush.

140
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,965
And stop writing your letters
telling us all to prepare for our ..

141
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,785
The moon <i>does </i>control the tides.

142
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,453
And nothing can live without the sun.

143
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,869
Why shouldn't we be controlled?

144
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:05,286
Because we are reasoning human beings,
silly. And not irresponsible machines.

145
00:15:05,524 --> 00:15:06,425
Listen, Laura.

146
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:10,539
This letter came from the Swami
just an hour ago. I have to tell you.

147
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:12,863
Listen.

148
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:17,247
"<i>I'd do anything to halt the disasters
that have come to you and your friends</i>."

149
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,765
"<i>As I would do anything
to save my own life</i>."

150
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,703
"<i>But I can do neither.
For I am helpless, too</i>."

151
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,742
"<i>I knew too much about the heavens</i>."

152
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,682
"<i>They are killing me</i>."

153
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:28,868
"<i>My own horoscope shows</i> .."

154
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:31,039
"<i>That I am to leave this earth</i>."

155
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,534
"<i>Before July the 1st</i>."

156
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,873
Ha-ha-ha.

157
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,232
Well, if I needed anything
more than common sense ..

158
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,348
To disprove your arguments,
that would be enough.

159
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:42,377
No-one is going to take his own life ..

160
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:45,037
Just to prove to 12 women
that he's a good stargazer.

161
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,569
You are deranged, Grace.
- This happens.

162
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,617
The Swami himself does die.

163
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:53,078
How <i>can</i> you disbelieve?

164
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:58,287
New York.

165
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,955
Before July the 1st.

166
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,605
[ Screams! ]

167
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:24,450
Well.

168
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:27,278
That makes it practically unanimous.

169
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:17,025
I'll have a lemonade
and bitters, please.

170
00:18:19,328 --> 00:18:20,375
Excuse me.

171
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,322
Aren't you Helen Dawson?

172
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:24,440
Before I was married, yes.

173
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,349
Hello .. uh ..?

174
00:18:27,471 --> 00:18:28,997
St Albans School, wasn't it?

175
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:32,278
Why, I have forgotten your name.

176
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:35,305
Ursula Georgi.
- Oh yes. Of course.

177
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,645
Well, isn't this fun, meeting like this?

178
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:40,392
Are you going to coast?

179
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:44,063
It doesn't seem long since
we were at St Albans, does it.

180
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,107
Tell me about the girls.

181
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,959
It's nice to have you
ask about the girls.

182
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,198
As I remember, it wasn't
very pleasant for you.

183
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:55,174
Oh.

184
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,097
I didn't mind having to leave.

185
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,898
It was hard on the missionary.

186
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,910
Who sent me there.

187
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,752
He picked me up in India.

188
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:09,914
To .. to save me.

189
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,092
Oh, all those things
mattered so dreadfully, then.

190
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,119
They seem so childish now.

191
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,740
How I used to envy you girls.

192
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,960
Your parties .. your sorority.

193
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,638
You are lucky you don't
belong, if you ask me.

194
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,264
Because of those timetables made out
by the stars, we were talking about?

195
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:45,065
You straight-thinking, rational Anglo
Saxons don't believe in such things.

196
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,095
Do you?

197
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:47,405
Laura doesn't.

198
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:48,991
Thank goodness.

199
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:53,593
Mrs Stanhope always was a
strong character, wasn't she.

200
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:54,985
Yes.

201
00:19:56,109 --> 00:19:57,842
That's why she's
getting us all together.

202
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:00,987
So we can laugh it all away.

203
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,333
I haven't laughed for so long.

204
00:20:08,443 --> 00:20:10,363
My little girl has the bluest eyes.

205
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,384
She was just two and a half year's old.

206
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:23,278
It's what happened to Yogadachi
himself that makes it all so convincing.

207
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:25,256
He predicted even the date he'd go.

208
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,602
You can't laugh that off, can you.

209
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:31,594
No.

210
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,988
I want you to read his last letter.

211
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,585
Isn't that silly?

212
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:09,153
A man I've never seen.

213
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:12,520
And he has the nerve to tell me
that I'm going to kill myself.

214
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,754
Why the gun, then?

215
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:18,212
Aren't you afraid?
- Afraid?

216
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:20,477
Why, of course not.

217
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:23,184
This belongs to my husband.

218
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:24,970
I brought it along with me.

219
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:27,964
Just to prove to myself
that the Swami is bogus.

220
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:32,145
If I avoided the thing now.

221
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,238
I <i>would</i> know that I was afraid.

222
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:41,200
Oh, are you going to bed?
- Yes. It's so late.

223
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:43,247
We'll be in Los Angeles in the morning.

224
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:46,032
I'll see you at breakfast.
- Fine.

225
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:49,079
If I was you I'd ..
- This ..?

226
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,591
Oh .. don't worry.

227
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:54,101
No stars are going to twinkle
twinkle me into committing suicide.

228
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:58,168
Goodnight.

229
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:00,640
Goodnight.

230
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:39,923
[ Gunshot! ]

231
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,701
Oh, you let an old lady beat you.

232
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,703
You did not beat me. I let
you win because you're a girl.

233
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:06,247
Jo's going to help Mother
now darling. Come on.

234
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:09,714
She don't want to help you, mother.
- Yes, she does want to help me.

235
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:11,591
Scoot.

236
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:14,729
Oh, he's precious.

237
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:18,695
I do envy you, Laura.

238
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,381
To me .. life is just an ashtray
full of cigarette butts.

239
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:25,451
Why don't you marry again, Jo?
- Oh ..

240
00:25:26,498 --> 00:25:28,698
I would if I was sure of
getting a kid like Bobby.

241
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:30,598
What about the present fiancée?

242
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:32,586
Oh, he's a lot of fun.

243
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,047
But all he wants is a ..

244
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:36,780
A well-stocked cellar.

245
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:38,962
A racehorse. Bridge.

246
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,163
Anything but babies.

247
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:44,452
Laura.

248
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,174
Laura, why don't <i>you
</i>marry again sometime?

249
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:48,419
No.

250
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:50,951
I could never be dependent
on anyone again.

251
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:53,443
I love standing on my own feet.

252
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,880
I wonder if any woman can?
- Why not?

253
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:57,299
I say.

254
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,853
Do you remember how you were always
afraid the boys would go too far?

255
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:02,778
And I was afraid that they wouldn't?

256
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,637
Here, let me help you.

257
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:07,797
Here's Helen's.

258
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:10,555
Where do you want her?
- Oh, let's put Helen there.

259
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:12,956
Excuse me, Mrs Stanhope.

260
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:14,223
Mother!

261
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:18,272
Can I put this up in my
room with nails, Mother?

262
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:20,386
It's for my engine to sleep on.

263
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,452
Hey, Burns, will you do it for me?
- Sure.

264
00:26:23,671 --> 00:26:25,006
That's keen. Come on.

265
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:26,923
Burns, where is Mrs Frye?
Did you meet her?

266
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:29,162
I met the train, yes ma'am.
But no-one came.

267
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,412
Isn't it funny Helen didn't wire?

268
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:39,854
Oh, she probably missed
it and is taking a cab.

269
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:53,821
What do you say, Sergeant?

270
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:59,016
I agree with you, coroner. For once.
- Much obliged.

271
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:01,971
What is it? What's happened?
- Suicide.

272
00:27:02,848 --> 00:27:06,190
Sergeant Clive here says the restricted
angles of the compartment prove that.

273
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,734
He's the mathematician
of the department, so ..

274
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,328
Suicide is bad enough,
but I'm relieved it wasn't ..

275
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:12,431
Murder?

276
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:13,765
No.

277
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,131
On the other hand.

278
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:18,615
<i>Something</i> makes one kill oneself.

279
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:21,039
So suicide <i>is</i> murder.

280
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,124
The trouble is you can't
arrest a <i>something</i>, can you.

281
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,751
I beg your pardon.

282
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:36,608
The porter believes he saw you
passing Mrs Frye's drawing room.

283
00:27:36,926 --> 00:27:38,571
At about the time this suicide happened.

284
00:27:40,384 --> 00:27:41,572
That's very possible.

285
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:44,559
Tell me .. did you hear
or see anything unusual?

286
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:47,799
I can't say that I did.

287
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,893
I feel terribly upset about it.

288
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:54,192
I met the lady on the train and
she seemed very charming.

289
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,294
Thank you, Miss .. or is it Mrs?

290
00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:00,282
"Miss" .. Clemens.

291
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,119
Clemens?

292
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:04,360
Thank you, Miss Clemens.

293
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:11,559
Alright, folks. You can go now.
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

294
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:25,305
Jo, I sent a wire to Helen in New York.
Thought perhaps she'd missed the train.

295
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,355
I haven't got an answer yet.

296
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:29,748
Strange, isn't it.

297
00:28:33,865 --> 00:28:35,773
Hello, Grace.
- Hello dear. How are you?

298
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:37,894
Jo Turner is here.
- Oh.

299
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:41,995
Hello, darling.
- Jo, dear.

300
00:28:42,294 --> 00:28:43,588
Quite in the flesh.

301
00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:47,386
Darling .. I'm sorry to make a liar
out of your incredible Swami.

302
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,177
But I haven't killed myself
over a man yet.       - Jo.

303
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:52,931
He should have known that it's the
men that kill themselves over me.

304
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:54,834
Sit down, Grace dear. Sit down.

305
00:28:55,082 --> 00:28:56,910
Oh Jo, please don't be so flippant.

306
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,272
What is written in the
stars must come to pass.

307
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,682
Okay with me.
I've had a lot of fun.

308
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,767
You are both fatalists.
- Hmm, sure.

309
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,888
When the Gods are
fed up with me .. voila!

310
00:29:08,111 --> 00:29:10,554
Don't pay any attention to her, Grace.
- I beg your pardon, madam.

311
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:13,299
Oh yes. We'll wait on dinner
for the others, Henry. But ..

312
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,276
You might bring some
cocktails in here, please.

313
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:17,673
Yes. But excuse me, a Policeman.

314
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:19,066
May I come in?

315
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,202
Excuse me but the baggage belonging to a
Mrs Frye was marked for delivery here.

316
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,386
Did anything happen?

317
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,699
I'm terribly sorry.

318
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:31,503
It appears to be.

319
00:29:32,246 --> 00:29:33,082
Suicide.

320
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,887
It happened on the train.

321
00:29:41,135 --> 00:29:43,581
Do you know of any reason that
could account for ..?    - Why ..

322
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:45,091
Mrs Frye.

323
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,557
A couple of months ago,
Sergeant, lost her only child.

324
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:50,757
I can understand that, Mrs Stanhope.

325
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:54,040
We were just going to have a ..

326
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,809
Reunion dinner.

327
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:57,955
Old classmates.

328
00:30:03,404 --> 00:30:06,985
Mrs Stanhope, If you will be kind enough
to drop into Headquarters, tomorrow say.

329
00:30:07,346 --> 00:30:10,151
A routine statement about Mrs Frye ..
- Yes, of course, Sergeant.

330
00:30:10,531 --> 00:30:12,721
Thank you. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

331
00:30:25,753 --> 00:30:27,169
Well, do you still doubt, Laura?

332
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:29,867
Are you still laughing, Jo?

333
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:33,028
Yogadachi has been right again.

334
00:30:34,145 --> 00:30:36,635
Oh, you must accept his truth as I have.

335
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:39,586
That's the trouble with you,
Grace. Glorifying such rot.

336
00:30:39,815 --> 00:30:40,519
Rot?

337
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:43,037
I tell you that nothing
could save Helen.

338
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,193
Nor May. Nor Hazel .. from fate.

339
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:48,712
Don't you understand?

340
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,515
It was written for them.

341
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:53,105
As it is for all of us.

342
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:55,446
Well, if it's all settled
for us, why worry?

343
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,211
Stop talking about it.
Stop thinking about it.

344
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:00,393
Anyone can think
themselves into anything.

345
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:03,894
You two are stumbling in
a dark material world.

346
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:06,740
I am above it.

347
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,105
As Yogadachi was.

348
00:31:10,046 --> 00:31:11,902
Death means peace.

349
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:13,767
Freedom.

350
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,192
I shall meet him.

351
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:19,714
Gladly.

352
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,527
Well .. I shan't.

353
00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:24,379
Depression or not, personally
I'm mad about this world.

354
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:26,968
Oh .. go on home, Grace.

355
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,317
You give me the creeps.
- No. Not I.

356
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:30,886
But what is written for you.

357
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:34,270
Only you are afraid to face it.
- Grace. I think you'd better go.

358
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:36,647
Just as you say.

359
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:49,134
Ooh .. she gives me the jitters.

360
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:52,535
I guess you'd go the same way too, if
you'd received one of those horoscopes.

361
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:54,978
I have.

362
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:57,122
No?

363
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,474
I've been trying not
to think about it, Jo.

364
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:07,654
He warned me that ..

365
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:10,309
That something dreadful
would happen to Bobby.

366
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,672
On or .. before his birthday.

367
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:16,739
But my dear, why on earth
didn't you go to the Police?

368
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:18,482
Oh, well.

369
00:32:18,844 --> 00:32:21,187
I was determined not to
give in to superstition.

370
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:24,338
Yes, but surely it has gone
beyond a joke now?

371
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:26,705
You're right.

372
00:32:27,272 --> 00:32:29,985
When I see that detective in the
morning, I'll tell him everything.

373
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:31,827
I think you should.

374
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,121
When is Bobby's birthday?

375
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,083
Sunday.

376
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:45,852
Three days.

377
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:22,071
I don't know how I've .. lasted.

378
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:23,692
Away from you.

379
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:26,349
You haven't.

380
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:29,650
You've grown fat.
- Well, it's a soft job.

381
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:33,158
Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

382
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:34,592
No.

383
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:37,412
I thought a little house would be
better while you're here.   - Yes.

384
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,608
How long must a man be in love with you
before you call him by his first name?

385
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,991
Why, you ..

386
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,092
You would think I was working for you.

387
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:54,554
You are.

388
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:03,509
Yeah.

389
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,431
Haven't you missed me?
- Of course I have.

390
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,474
When are you going to
tell me about things?

391
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,423
When are we going to stop all this?

392
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,934
I didn't figure on going this far.
I didn't even think it would work.

393
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:21,566
But you see, it does.
- With the others, perhaps.

394
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:23,848
But .. but the Stanhopes?

395
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,810
Is Mrs Stanhope ..

396
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:29,422
Laura?

397
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,850
Is she still strong?

398
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:33,835
Yes, she is.

399
00:34:36,957 --> 00:34:38,299
I hate her.

400
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,257
Her cool, poised character.

401
00:34:43,392 --> 00:34:44,877
Her rigid mind.

402
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:46,834
You'll never break her.

403
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,151
Yes, I will.

404
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:58,646
That big elephant was so friendly
picked him right up with his trunk.

405
00:35:00,012 --> 00:35:01,651
Here, Robert. It's for you.

406
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:03,574
Gee, it has my name on it.
- Yes.

407
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:06,161
I bet it's a present for my birthday.

408
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,874
Hmm .. chocolates, Nanny.
- Not until you've finished your milk.

409
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:25,365
Bye, darling.

410
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,502
Where did that come from?
- The mail, madam.

411
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:34,514
Perhaps I shouldn't have given it
to him. It must be a present for Sunday.

412
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:51,802
Now can I, Nan? Can I?
- No. No.

413
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:53,804
Not so early in the morning, darling.

414
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,985
I'm sorry, Mrs Stanhope. Come along
Bobby, you'll be late for school.

415
00:35:57,165 --> 00:35:59,074
No .. no .. no.

416
00:35:59,652 --> 00:36:00,461
Bobby.

417
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,936
How would you like to miss school today?

418
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,003
Stay home and help Nan
with your birthday party?

419
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:07,479
Can Burns finish building
my pirate boat?

420
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:10,486
You bet he can. Would you like that?
- Thank you, Mummy.

421
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:15,755
Hey, Burns. I don't
have to go to school.

422
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:35,694
Well, the candy is okay.

423
00:36:37,074 --> 00:36:38,977
But it's been tampered
with since it was bought.

424
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:43,294
If anybody had eaten it, he'd have
strangled to death in 30 seconds.

425
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:45,667
Bobby.

426
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:51,492
How many of the Swami's predictions
have come true, Mrs Stanhope?

427
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:53,111
Three.
- Four.

428
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:55,610
You must remember that the
Swami foretold his own death.

429
00:36:55,938 --> 00:36:57,354
Well, there is no sense in them.

430
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,308
The man goes out and mails the candy,
then goes and kills himself. No sense.

431
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:03,237
That's right, Chief.

432
00:37:03,863 --> 00:37:07,099
It looks like the Swami was hired
to scare those women into ..

433
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,947
How can you hire a man to kill himself?

434
00:37:09,341 --> 00:37:10,840
Ah, there is no sense in it.

435
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,319
Anyway Sergeant, it's your case.

436
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:17,510
If I think about it anymore I'll
probably wind up in the booby hatch.

437
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,775
That's just what happened
to the other people.

438
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,270
Thinking about it too much.

439
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:27,094
This case is just crazy enough
for Sergeant Clive to solve.

440
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:28,845
Excuse me, lady.

441
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:35,242
Oh why should the Swami
want to kill my little boy?

442
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:36,792
Perhaps he didn't.

443
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:41,606
This package was stamped at the Parcel
Post window at 14 minutes past three.

444
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:44,747
Now, the accident happened
at two minutes past twelve.

445
00:37:45,985 --> 00:37:48,403
The Swami was dead for over three
hours when the candy was mailed.

446
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,265
Dead?

447
00:37:49,987 --> 00:37:51,505
But someone else is still alive.

448
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:54,534
Someone who still wants to kill Bobby?

449
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,153
Possibly .. there must be an accomplice.

450
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:01,755
The person who mailed this box is likely
responsible for all that's happened.

451
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:04,024
I'm going to find that person.

452
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:07,359
I'll send some men to
your house at once.

453
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:10,531
I suggest that .. you be at
your boy's side constantly.

454
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:11,620
Oh yes.

455
00:38:12,086 --> 00:38:13,749
Yes, I'll be very careful.

456
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:18,433
Goodbye, Sergeant.
- Oh, pardon me.

457
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,575
Is that sorority pin always worn there?

458
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:23,742
Yes. That's the ritual.

459
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:27,706
And only the girls who are members of
your particular club wear them?   - Yes.

460
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:32,134
Where is St Albans seminary?

461
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,359
North of San Francisco. At Medora.

462
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:36,849
What are you thinking, Sergeant?

463
00:38:37,908 --> 00:38:40,474
I was just thinking of you.
Of your boy, Mrs Stanhope.

464
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,997
Oh, thank you.
- Not at all.

465
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,705
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

466
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:59,487
It seems incredible that such
things as you describe.

467
00:38:59,778 --> 00:39:03,046
Could possibly be happening to those
other children of mine out in the world.

468
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:04,862
They're not children any more.

469
00:39:05,782 --> 00:39:08,337
The New York Police questioned
Mrs Hazel Cousins in jail.

470
00:39:09,189 --> 00:39:11,315
She told them that she
started the round-robin.

471
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:14,474
But .. you gave her the idea.

472
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:17,773
Why, how could she
say that? When I didn't.

473
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:20,889
I was merely having luncheon
with the dear child.

474
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,561
When I was attending a conference
of educators in New York.

475
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,006
Pardon me, Miss Kirsten.

476
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:27,934
Hazel Cousins insists that you
suggested the idea to her.

477
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:29,957
Oh but Mr Clive .. I ..?

478
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,262
Oh, it's simply impossible.

479
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:33,802
Why I ..

480
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:35,690
Wait a moment.

481
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,990
I'm remembering something.

482
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:41,731
Yes, I did see someone else.

483
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:42,728
Who?

484
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:43,881
Yes.

485
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:46,581
Yes, the mood is coming back to me.

486
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:50,096
Schoolgirl friendships .. fading.

487
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:52,155
Soon forgotten.

488
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:54,367
That's a lovely sentiment.

489
00:39:54,577 --> 00:39:55,936
Would you mind telling me who?

490
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,466
Of course not.
- Who?

491
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:00,218
Another one of my girls. Ursula Georgi.

492
00:40:01,764 --> 00:40:03,323
That's a very musical name, isn't it.

493
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:05,020
Would you mind saying it again?

494
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,135
"Ursula .. Georgi".

495
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:10,201
You enunciate beautifully, Miss Kirsten.

496
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,467
What was she like?

497
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:14,261
Sweet .. very.

498
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,170
And mystical.

499
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,302
Sounds very interesting.

500
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:23,126
Now tell me, Miss Kirsten have you a
photograph of the class group? Anything?

501
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:25,284
Oh no. She wasn't here
long enough for that.

502
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:27,659
One day she decided to leave.
- And she left?

503
00:40:28,317 --> 00:40:30,589
You are a very understanding young man.

504
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:42,604
Why didn't I go to the Police sooner?

505
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:44,525
I've been crazy, Jo.

506
00:40:44,803 --> 00:40:46,328
Trying to whip instinct with ..

507
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:49,038
With just reason.
- Oh, you mustn't talk like this.

508
00:40:49,138 --> 00:40:51,310
You mustn't even think like this.
- No, I know I mustn't.

509
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,524
I know I mustn't.

510
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:53,988
But I am.

511
00:40:54,524 --> 00:40:56,483
That boy of mine is all I've got, Jo.

512
00:40:56,937 --> 00:40:59,680
How can I help it with things I
don't understand striking at him?

513
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:01,005
Like it did the others.

514
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:03,980
Out of the dark where
you can't protect him.

515
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:05,615
Imagining that ..

516
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:08,620
That every little breath
he takes .. may be his last.

517
00:41:10,547 --> 00:41:12,518
Nothing can happen here.
- No.

518
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:14,656
My mind tells me it's impossible.

519
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,599
But it <i>is</i> happening.

520
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:20,028
I'm afraid. Jo, I'm afraid.

521
00:41:21,769 --> 00:41:23,807
Bobby .. Bobby!

522
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:31,752
Darling.

523
00:41:32,396 --> 00:41:34,902
Promise Mother you'll never
leave the house alone again.

524
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:35,895
Promise?

525
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,761
Why not, Mumsy?
- Oh ..

526
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:40,466
Mother is just a little
worried. That's all.

527
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,320
You don't need to worry, Mumsy.
I'll take care of you.

528
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:53,020
Relay this to New York right away.
- Alright, Sergeant.

529
00:42:26,608 --> 00:42:28,776
Give this to master
Bobby with all your love.

530
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:31,269
And don't drop it.

531
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:33,169
I ..

532
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:35,804
I can't.

533
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:38,610
I can't bear the thought of it.

534
00:42:41,353 --> 00:42:42,407
I can't do it.

535
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,608
Of course you will.

536
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:57,105
Darling.

537
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:00,334
You and I are going
away together, aren't we.

538
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,809
As soon as everything is done.

539
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:09,449
You'll do it.

540
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,097
Won't you?

541
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,062
What .. what will it do to him?

542
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:19,089
He won't know anything.

543
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:21,264
He'll bounce it.

544
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:25,397
Children always bounce
rubber balls, don't they.

545
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,348
And then?
- Why ..?

546
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:31,354
Shush.

547
00:43:36,899 --> 00:43:38,350
You've done a lot for me, Jo.

548
00:43:39,248 --> 00:43:40,664
We've helped each other, rather.

549
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:42,890
But with Sergeant Clive around.

550
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:44,623
You won't need me.

551
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,594
But just the same.

552
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:49,435
I hate to see you go.
- And I hate going too.

553
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:52,035
Only I don't dare stay.

554
00:43:52,726 --> 00:43:53,513
Why?

555
00:43:54,176 --> 00:43:56,900
Oh, well I've quarrelled
with my fiancée and ..

556
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:59,766
I believe anything of
myself when I'm in love.

557
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,215
Look here, Jo.

558
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:03,853
You surely don't believe
your prediction?

559
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,643
Ha .. I'm human, too.

560
00:44:07,423 --> 00:44:11,205
Do you know .. the only credulous
animal on the whole face of the earth.

561
00:44:11,937 --> 00:44:12,937
Is the human.

562
00:44:14,682 --> 00:44:16,911
You'll excuse me, Mrs Stanhope.
- Yes, Burns?

563
00:44:17,175 --> 00:44:18,366
I hope you don't mind.

564
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:20,918
I .. I took the liberty of ..

565
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:23,007
Of getting the little fellow a ..

566
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,399
Well, I got him a ball for his birthday.

567
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:30,769
Very thoughtful of you, Burns.
I'm sure he'll like it.

568
00:44:31,282 --> 00:44:33,070
Is the car ready, Burns?
- Yes, Miss Turner.

569
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:34,074
Good.

570
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:37,262
Well, darling.

571
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:42,264
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Jo.

572
00:44:53,979 --> 00:44:54,932
What's that?

573
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,573
A present dear, from Burns.

574
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,903
Can I see it?
- No. You know, Bobby.

575
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,264
If you open it now, you won't have
anything left for your birthday.

576
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:18,355
Come on sweetheart, take your nap.

577
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:20,914
That's it.

578
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:25,807
Goodnight.

579
00:46:46,633 --> 00:46:48,234
Here's a wire from New York, Sergeant.

580
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,224
Are you almost through?
- Just about, Sergeant.

581
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:26,968
Say, I know that woman.
- Yeah?

582
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:30,051
Yeah. She was on the train when
Helen Frye committed suicide.

583
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:31,612
Let me have it.

584
00:47:39,617 --> 00:47:40,915
Mike.
- Coming.

585
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:45,822
We want this woman.
Her name is Ursula Georgi.

586
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:47,251
A half-breed type.

587
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:49,595
Half Hindu, half Japanese. I don't know.

588
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:52,490
She's living right here in this
town. I want you to find her.

589
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,869
Check every move she makes.

590
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:57,372
There are one million, 238,048
people in Los Angeles.

591
00:47:57,562 --> 00:47:59,838
And you want only one woman? A cinch.

592
00:48:00,301 --> 00:48:01,439
Get going. Get going.

593
00:48:04,637 --> 00:48:07,863
Ann, did you tell Burns I wanted him?
- He's bringing the car, Mrs Stanhope.

594
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:10,142
Are these all the presents?
- Yes, Mrs Stanhope.

595
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:13,005
I won't feel satisfied until I've
had every one of them tested.

596
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:16,424
I suppose it's silly .. but ever
since that poisoned candy came ..

597
00:48:21,926 --> 00:48:24,722
Put these in the car please, Burns.
And then take me to Headquarters.

598
00:48:25,057 --> 00:48:26,008
Yes, ma'am.

599
00:48:26,922 --> 00:48:29,754
What's the matter, Burns?
- I beg your pardon, Mrs Stanhope.

600
00:48:30,262 --> 00:48:31,924
I had hoped to have the afternoon off.

601
00:48:32,024 --> 00:48:34,166
You see .. my mother is not well.

602
00:48:34,587 --> 00:48:36,346
Oh, I'm sorry Burns.

603
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:38,734
Well.

604
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:41,422
Well, I tell you what you do.
You drop me off at Headquarters.

605
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,749
And you take the car on
out to your mother's.

606
00:48:43,936 --> 00:48:45,850
Sergeant Clive will bring me home.
- But ..

I don't know. Something ..

611
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:19,705
Is your switch on?

612
00:49:33,323 --> 00:49:34,932
I got a hot line on Ursula Georgi.

613
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:37,145
She bought herself some
dynamite in a hardware store.

614
00:49:37,245 --> 00:49:39,848
Dynamite? How can she get hold
of dynamite without a permit?

615
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:42,458
She talked him right out of it.
He says she gave him the willies.

616
00:49:43,684 --> 00:49:45,157
Mike, we've got to get that woman.

617
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:47,799
Sergeant .. here's some more
dope on that Hindu dame's case.

618
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:48,739
Read it.

619
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:52,128
Yogadachi chauffeur Burns,
disappeared a month ago.

620
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:53,337
Burns?

621
00:49:59,311 --> 00:50:01,648
Hello? Get me Mrs Stanhope
in Beverly Hills quick.

622
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:04,526
You have her number on the board.

623
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:08,792
Hello? Is Mrs Stanhope there?

624
00:50:09,065 --> 00:50:11,135
Mrs Stanhope has just
left for your office.

625
00:50:11,326 --> 00:50:14,111
She's taking all the packages
that Bobby had for his birthday.

626
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:16,273
Is Burns there?
- Burns?

627
00:50:16,835 --> 00:50:18,184
He's driving her down.

628
00:50:18,409 --> 00:50:20,798
Do you know if there was a present
from Burns among those things?

629
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:23,388
A what?

630
00:50:24,263 --> 00:50:25,178
A rubber ball?

00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:29,497

00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:52,614
They tell me he is handsome.

700
00:55:52,911 --> 00:55:54,840
And bright. And very lovable.

701
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,564
Yes. Burns told me.

702
00:55:59,455 --> 00:56:00,951
Tomorrow is his birthday.

703
00:56:04,485 --> 00:56:06,163
I looked at his star tonight.

704
00:56:08,186 --> 00:56:09,990
And it was glowing red.

705
00:56:11,394 --> 00:56:12,643
Like the ball I sent you.

706
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:14,940
Why should you want to kill Bobby?

707
00:56:15,284 --> 00:56:17,200
He's your child, isn't he? Yours!

708
00:56:17,509 --> 00:56:20,514
What have I done? What has anyone
done to make you so inhuman?

709
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:26,492
Do I hear the very human white
race .. asking that question?

710
00:56:27,334 --> 00:56:29,173
When I was twelve years old.

711
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,246
A white sailor ..
- You're insane. Insane.

712
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,207
Maybe I am.

713
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:34,962
But do you know what it
means to be a half-breed?

714
00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:37,839
A half-caste in a world ruled by whites?

715
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,448
If you're a male, you're a coolie.

716
00:56:40,863 --> 00:56:43,351
If you're a female, you're .. well ..

717
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:47,730
The white half of me cries for
the courtesy and protection ..

718
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,393
That women like you get.

719
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:52,855
The only way I could free myself
was by becoming white.

720
00:56:53,962 --> 00:56:56,409
And it was almost in
my hands .. when you ..

721
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:58,756
You and your Kappa society stopped me.

722
00:56:59,094 --> 00:57:01,712
You're crazy, what did ..?
- My parents spent six years slaving.

723
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:04,299
To get moñey enough to put
me through finishing school.

724
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,754
To make the world accept me as white.

725
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:10,809
And you .. and the others wouldn't
let me cross the çolor line.

726
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:13,686
But we were young.
Maybe we <i>were</i> cruël.

727
00:57:14,091 --> 00:57:16,147
But you can't use
that to justîfy murder.

728
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:18,628
I can.

729
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:38,406
You are very tired, Laura.

730
00:58:31,502 --> 00:58:32,374
Mrs Stanhope.

731
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:33,834
Mrs Stanhope.

732
00:59:26,883 --> 00:59:27,940
T-G oö
