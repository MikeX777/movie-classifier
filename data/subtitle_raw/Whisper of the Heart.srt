World Emporium' Proprietor
KOBAYASHI Keiju

7
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,730
- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it?

8
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,740
I'm home.

9
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,490
Thanks.

10
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,700
You don't need a bag for just milk!

11
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:29,120
They put it in one.

12
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:32,750
Just say no. Pour me some too.

13
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,290
Dad, want some barley tea?

14
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,090
Please, I'll come there.

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,430
- Thanks. The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.

16
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,050
I should buy an electronic notebook.

17
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,640
You could've gone to your aunt's too.

18
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,400
No. Onee-chan wears me out.

19
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,650
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

20
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,150
Do you need lunch?

21
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,940
No, I'll eat out.

22
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:05,030
The library's busy
going to a bar code system.

23
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:07,910
I like the book cards better.

24
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,700
Me too.

25
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:13,160
Hey, this isn't right...

26
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,460
What?

27
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,880
Did you leave out a line?

28
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,840
- You're right!
- Let me go first.

29
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,630
I have to get this right
or my professor will complain.

30
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:27,720
Note: Amasawa Seiji

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,970
This guy...

32
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,520
You can read,
but don't stay up too late.

33
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah. Good night.

34
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,870
I thought I'd seen that name before.

35
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,740
Here too.

36
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,960
Note: Amasawa Seiji

37
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,960
He's taken all
these books out before me.

38
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,930
Amasawa Seiji. What's he like?
Is he good-looking?

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,370
Shizuku! Get up!

40
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm leaving!

41
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.

42
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:46,300
Bye!

43
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,430
Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!

44
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,430
My purse!

45
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,150
You ran back upstairs again?

46
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:00,940
Yeah.

47
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,650
That's funny.

48
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,740
Try by the phone...

49
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,740
Found it!

50
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,320
Just where you left it...

51
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,990
I'm late! Lock the door!

52
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:13,540
Silly!

53
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,500
It's flying so low!

54
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,970
Today's a lucky day!

55
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,160
Is it ever hot!

56
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,470
Yahoo! How's it going?

57
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,110
Hit it!

58
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:33,780
Hi, Shizuku!

59
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,450
Hi! Try your best!

60
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,750
Kosaka-sensei, are you there?

61
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,000
Tsukishima? What are you doing here?

62
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:48,210
Could I ask a favor?

63
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:50,920
Nothing weird, I hope...

64
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:53,720
- Let me in the library!
- What?

65
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:56,350
Can't you wait till school starts?

66
00:06:56,385 --> 00:07:00,350
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.

67
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,270
I'm reading 20 before school starts.

68
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:08,860
Don't forget, you've got high school
entrance exams.

69
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:12,110
- Hurry it up!
- Here it is!

70
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:13,530
Bring it here.

71
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,540
Give me your card and the book card.

72
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,620
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,210
No one's ever borrowed this book!

74
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,710
It's rare. They don't even have it
at the public library.

75
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,760
Note: Donated

76
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,810
"Amasawa." Sensei!

77
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:43,980
Do you know who this "Amasawa" is?

78
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:47,190
Look what you made me do!

79
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,650
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.

80
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,650
Ask an older teacher.

81
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:54,240
Shizuku!

82
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:59,410
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!

83
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:03,250
If I have to stand in the sun,
I get more freckles!

84
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:04,250
S-Sorry!

85
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:08,000
Relax, Harada.
You take freckles much too seriously.

86
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:10,420
They're a serious problem, Sensei!

87
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:14,760
Yeah, yeah.
OK, out of here, both of you.

88
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,640
Move up! Move up!

89
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,440
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?

90
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,940
<i>White clouds spreading up over a hill</i>

91
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:38,570
<i>A road winds up to the town</i>

92
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:42,830
<i>An old house with small windows</i>

93
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:47,040
<i>An old dog waits for me to come home</i>

94
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:51,630
<i>Country road leading far away</i>

95
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:56,130
<i>The road to my old hometown</i>

96
00:08:56,165 --> 00:09:00,680
<i>West 'Ginia, my mother the mountain</i>

97
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:05,310
<i>My good old hometown</i>

98
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,100
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.

99
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,400
It's trite.

100
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,560
Yeah?

101
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,320
I wrote another one.

102
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,200
<i>Concrete roads, everywhere</i>

103
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:25,200
<i>Cut down all the trees
Filled in the valleys</i>

104
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:27,790
<i>Western Tokyo</i>

105
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>Tama Mountain</i>

106
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:34,340
<i>My hometown is concrete roads</i>

107
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,470
What is this?!

108
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,140
But what's this problem?

109
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,260
You don't need the lyrics yet.

110
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:46,890
No. Are you in love with anyone?

111
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:48,270
What?

112
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:52,110
Studying for entrance exams
would be easier having someone.

113
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:53,860
We could encourage each other.

114
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,150
Yuko! You're in love!

115
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,070
You got a love letter?!

116
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,450
Shh!

117
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:04,660
When? Who? Is he handsome?

118
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:08,080
He's in another class. He's not bad.

119
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:11,420
Meet him, then!
If you don't like him, just say no!

120
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:12,630
Yeah, but...

121
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,630
So there's someone else you like!

122
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,430
You can't hide it from me! Confess!

123
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,970
It's Su... Su...

124
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,270
Tsukishima!

125
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:30,060
Bring me my bag, will you?

126
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,060
- Sugimura!
- That blue sports bag.

127
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,570
Come on, Tsukishima!

128
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,320
Throw it over here.

129
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,360
Shut up and go back to the bench!

130
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:47,240
I'm first-string,
and we're through to the regionals!

131
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:48,240
Yuko?

132
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,430
You're in love with Sugimura?

133
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:07,560
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!

134
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:10,060
Don't worry. He's too dense.

135
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,850
But what about the love letter?

136
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,400
I'll think about it awhile.

137
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:21,570
I see.

138
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,780
At least your parents
aren't always after you to study.

139
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:28,620
Silence isn't always great.

140
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,160
I wonder...

141
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,000
- Oh, no!
- What?

142
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:35,210
I forgot my book! I'll go back.

143
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:36,420
I'll ride you.

144
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:39,340
No. You'll be late for cram school.

145
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,130
I'll call you.

146
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,130
That book...

147
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,130
Oh, is it yours?

148
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,060
Here, Tsukishima Shizuku.

149
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,060
How do you know my name?

150
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,060
Guess!

151
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,570
My library card.

152
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:44,650
<i>I'd forget about Concrete Road, though.</i>

153
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,580
You read it!

154
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,330
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

155
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,960
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

156
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,590
Jerk!

157
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,770
<i>"I'd forget about Concrete Road."</i>

158
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,600
Get lost!

159
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm home.

160
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,730
Onee-chan? You're back already?

161
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:06,570
I'm beat!

162
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,660
I got a ride with someone
who was coming this way.

163
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,490
Where's Mom?

164
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:16,660
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Dad's at work.

165
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,870
You could clean up a little.

166
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:23,170
- What about dinner?
- I'm going to wash the rice.

167
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:26,170
What's this, Shizuku!
The breakfast things are still out!

168
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm getting to it!

169
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,350
Mom's busy! We've got to help!

170
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,270
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

171
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,610
Aunt says come see her
when you get into high school.

172
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,910
Are you studying?

173
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:57,410
Don't think you can take it easy just
because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

174
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,910
I know!

175
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,960
She even wanted me
to bring home soy sauce!

176
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,750
That's your aunt, all right.

177
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,260
It was the same thing last year.

178
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:12,840
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!

179
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,600
Two kilos of it!

180
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,360
Shizuku! Get up
and vacuum by your desk!

181
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,030
I'm washing the sheets.

182
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,780
And airing the bedding.

183
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,040
- Where's Mom?
- Long gone.

184
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,550
Put that stuff away
and bring Dad's lunch to him.

185
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:50,670
Me?!

186
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:53,930
Why not? You're going to the library.

187
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,680
Shall I go instead?

188
00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:02,180
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath
and the balcony and go to the co-op?

189
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:06,900
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.

190
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,110
I'm going!

191
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,370
Shizuku!

192
00:16:20,405 --> 00:16:22,870
Mail these, will you?

193
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:24,120
What?

194
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,040
M-A-I-L!

195
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,920
You don't have to read them!

196
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:36,430
Take the paper clip off.

197
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:38,800
- Your boyfriend?
- Idiot!

198
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,820
Hey, cat, are you alone?

199
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,830
Where are you going?

200
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,210
What's out there?

201
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,340
Hey! Answer me!

202
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,100
I get off here. What about you?

203
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,110
See you.

204
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,960
Hey! A cat!

205
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,600
The library's that way!

206
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,760
And it felt just like
the start of a story.

207
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,040
There he is!

208
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,240
Note: No Entrance

209
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,770
What a hill! How far up is he going?

210
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,370
Cat?

211
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,170
Cat?

212
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,920
Does he live around here?

213
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,580
Hey, cat! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?

214
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,400
I never knew there was
a place like this way up here.

215
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,130
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

216
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,640
Maybe you're teasing me too.

217
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,450
I never guessed there was
a store like this up here either.

218
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,230
Beautiful doll!

219
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,410
Are you that cat?

220
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,010
- Oh, hello.
- Um...

221
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:57,090
That's all right.
Look around all you want.

222
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,300
The Baron gets bored.

223
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,480
Is this doll the Baron?

224
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:08,440
Yep. Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name.

225
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,370
Sorry.

226
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,330
- Thanks. I'm fine now.
- That's a great clock.

227
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:27,710
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out. Look.

228
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,130
It's beautiful. What is it?

229
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,640
Wait and see.

230
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,180
What great dwarfs!

231
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:28,520
So, you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, are you?

232
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,480
Watch the face... if it works.

233
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,590
A fairy!

234
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,340
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

235
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,300
- A princess?
- That's right.

236
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,070
Are they in love?

237
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,320
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.

238
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,870
Only while the clock is striking 12
she is changed back from a sheep.

239
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:30,660
But he appears every hour

240
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:32,620
and waits for her.

241
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:38,460
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

242
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,880
That's why they both look so sad.

243
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,470
This clock's fast, isn't it?

244
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:51,600
Only about five minutes, though.

245
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:52,560
Oh, no!

246
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,060
I've got to be at the library! Goodbye.

247
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,360
Can I come back sometime?

248
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:02,740
Sure, but go left
to get to the library!

249
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,580
I'm right above it!

250
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:25,510
What a find!
A place where stories start!

251
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,930
Fantastic!

252
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,100
Tsukishima!

253
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:33,980
Tsukishima Shizuku!

254
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,110
Isn't this yours?

255
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,610
Forgetful, aren't you.

256
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:49,620
- Thanks, but how?
- Guess!

257
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,750
The cat. Is that your cat?

258
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,630
You sure eat a big lunch!

259
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,920
No!

260
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:05,010
<i>Concrete roads, everywhere...</i>

261
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,930
It's not mine! Hey!

262
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,640
Oh, here you are.

263
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,350
What's wrong with you?

264
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,770
It's hard to explain.

265
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,530
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.

266
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:27,490
Then what someone said
buried me alive.

267
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:29,490
Sounds complicated.

268
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,160
- Getting more books?
- Seven more to go.

269
00:29:36,195 --> 00:29:39,960
- Still at it? What about lunch?
- I'll buy something.

270
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,380
You will? Thanks, then.

271
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,190
June 16th...

272
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,280
Wow! Amasawa's read this one too!

273
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,490
What's he like?

274
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,040
No! He's not you!

275
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,600
Shizuku! Hurry!

276
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,390
I'm late!

277
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,100
Pass my umbrella.

278
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,900
Rain every day this term!

279
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,530
At least you're studying
because you want to.

280
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:31,780
Sorry.

281
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:33,570
Study hard!

282
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:34,990
Don't you worry!

283
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,960
- Shizuku!
- Hi!

284
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:46,500
Hurry! We'll be late!

285
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,180
- I hate all these tests!
- One every day!

286
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,020
- Did you answer?
- No.

287
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:01,310
Did he say anything?

288
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,440
I'm going to say no.

289
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:07,570
Yeah? Maybe that's best.

290
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:09,030
Sugimura!

291
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,030
Better hurry!

292
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,240
I know!

293
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,000
Time's up. Gather the papers.

294
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,970
See you this afternoon.

295
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,220
Let's go see Kosaka-sensei.

296
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:42,140
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

297
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:43,520
Sure.

298
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:45,600
- Tsukishima!
- What?

299
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:47,900
I lucked out on the test!

300
00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:49,400
Isn't that nice.

301
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:52,400
Everything I studied was on it!

302
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:54,950
So, you're not just a baseball goof.

303
00:32:54,985 --> 00:32:59,200
Yuko's good at guessing too.
Why not study with her?

304
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,580
With Harada?

305
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,750
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?

306
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,040
Come on!

307
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,620
Stop fixing me up!

308
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:13,760
Was it obvious?

309
00:33:13,795 --> 00:33:15,890
I never just guess!

310
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:17,010
Sorry!

311
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,930
Excuse me.

312
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,840
A library book donor?
Gee, I don't know.

313
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:30,600
Sorry to bother you at lunchtime.
There's this stamp in it.

314
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,370
Oh...

315
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,580
That's Dr. Amasawa.

316
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:40,660
I've read it. It's a good book!

317
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,160
Yes, very. What kind of person is he?

318
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,630
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.

319
00:33:49,665 --> 00:33:53,530
The PTA?
Would you know his given name?

320
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,330
His given name?

321
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:59,900
Kimura-sensei, do you remember
that Dr. Amasawa's given name?

322
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:03,740
Dr. Amasawa? It was Koichi, Amasawa Koichi.

323
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,180
Amasawa Koichi.

324
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:11,150
His youngest son's in your year,
Tsukishima. You don't know him?

325
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:13,150
He is?!

326
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,080
Umm... Thank you very much!

327
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,820
Goodbye!

328
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
Sorry!

329
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,120
Shizuku, where are you going?

330
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,430
What a surprise!

331
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:30,130
Tell me about it!

332
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,200
What's with you?!

333
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,400
Sorry!

334
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,180
Hey, where are you going?

335
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,070
He ignored me! Of all the nerve!

336
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,040
Who is he? Where are you going?

337
00:35:09,075 --> 00:35:12,040
He's a jerk!
He won't make me avoid him!

338
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,260
I've been carrying her lunch all over.

339
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,220
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?

340
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:26,680
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!

341
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:28,850
It isn't true!

342
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:31,810
You met a prince
from one of your books?

343
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:32,980
Is he handsome?

344
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:35,650
I just want to find out what he's like!

345
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:39,820
Come on, Yuko,
you heard his name. Tell us!

346
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,860
Yuko!

347
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:43,700
It happened too fast.

348
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:47,700
"Ma," something, "Masaki," maybe...

349
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,410
Right, Shizuku?

350
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:50,580
Dunno...

351
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:55,630
But it's like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

352
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:58,170
You want to know, but you don't.

353
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,340
Your heart beats in misery and ecstasy!

354
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:05,600
How terribly romantic!

355
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,890
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyric?

356
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,690
- You finished?!
- Let's see!

357
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:20,110
Oh, Shizuku-sama! Oh, great poet!
We will not transgress again!

358
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,450
All right, then.

359
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,370
I'm not sure...

360
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:32,120
I don't know about old hometowns,
so I wrote about what I feel.

361
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,250
This is great!

362
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,840
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

363
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:45,470
<i>If I go right to the end</i>

364
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:50,140
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

365
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:55,480
<i>To that town, country road</i>

366
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:57,900
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

367
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,190
It's not hard to sing?

368
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:01,440
We'll manage.

369
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:05,660
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it at the teachers' thank you!

370
00:37:05,695 --> 00:37:06,950
There too?!

371
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:09,870
- Slow down!
- I like this part.

372
00:37:09,905 --> 00:37:13,870
"I left because I was alone
and I had nothing.

373
00:37:13,905 --> 00:37:18,080
Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong..."

374
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:20,130
Ladies, the bell.

375
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,470
The sun's come out!

376
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,970
Shizuku!

377
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:36,310
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.

378
00:37:36,345 --> 00:37:38,730
No, I'm going to the library.

379
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:40,860
There's another test tomorrow.

380
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,860
- I'll study there.
- Bookworm!

381
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,950
- Later.
- Bye-bye.

382
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,230
Harada.

383
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,740
Can I talk to you for a minute?

384
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,040
It's closed.

385
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,840
Have these flowers been watered?

386
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,440
Baron's gone.
Maybe someone bought him.

387
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,820
Note: World Emporium;
Nishi Shiro, Prop.

388
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,830
Nishi Shiro. Maybe
that jerk's name is Nishi too.

389
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,970
Shizuku! Shizuku!

390
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,720
Yuko-chan's on the phone!

391
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,440
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

392
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,600
Yuko?

393
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,570
What? I can't hear you.

394
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,150
I'll be there in a minute.

395
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,200
Bye.

396
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,070
- Where are you going?
- Not far.

397
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,670
What's wrong?

398
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,340
- Shizuku!
- What's the matter?

399
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,840
What's with this face?

400
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:10,050
What am I going to do?!

401
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:15,760
The guy who wrote the letter
got Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

402
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,890
Huh? That's bad.

403
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,770
Why you, of all people?!

404
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,690
Hey!

405
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,490
That guy is so dense!

406
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,450
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him.

407
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,290
I'll apologize to him.

408
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:46,380
But I can't go to school tomorrow
looking like this.

409
00:40:46,415 --> 00:40:47,630
And miss the test?

410
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,090
Yeah.

411
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,510
I see.

412
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,030
Idiot!

413
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,570
What?

414
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,120
It was easy.

415
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,200
The library again, Shizuku?

416
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:22,450
I'm going to Yuko's.

417
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:24,370
I see. Say hello to her.

418
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,800
Tsukishima!

419
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,300
Wait up!

420
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,890
About Harada...

421
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:58,320
And then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

422
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,660
She said, "Why you, of all people,"
didn't she?

423
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,210
Yeah. A guy on the
baseball team asked me.

424
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,460
No!

425
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,550
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!

426
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:14,920
Don't you understand?!

427
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,260
No, I don't!

428
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:18,380
Tell me!

429
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,770
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!

430
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,770
What?! No way! I don't need this!

431
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:33,270
You don't? How do you think Yuko
feels? She stayed home sick today!

432
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,700
But... I like you!

433
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:39,280
What?

434
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,450
Don't make jokes at a time like this!

435
00:42:42,485 --> 00:42:45,540
It's not a joke!
I've liked you for a long time!

436
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,580
Not me! You can't!

437
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,880
You don't like me?
Or do you have a boyfriend?

438
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,670
I don't have a boyfriend.

439
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,840
But...

440
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,050
- I'm sorry!
- Wait!

441
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,550
Tell me the truth!

442
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:09,480
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...

443
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,440
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.

444
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,450
Just friends?

445
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:26,700
Forever?

446
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,710
I see.

447
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,510
I'm the one who's dense.

448
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,360
Miss, the parcel delivery left this with me.

449
00:44:37,395 --> 00:44:39,730
Thank you again.

450
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,420
You don't have to do this.

451
00:44:56,455 --> 00:44:58,880
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

452
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,010
Oh, you're home.

453
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,380
Shizuku?

454
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,630
Hi.

455
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,470
Have you been shut out too?

456
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,680
Do you live here? Are you hungry?

457
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,690
You're not very nice. Just like me.

458
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,700
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet.

459
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,200
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.

460
00:46:56,235 --> 00:47:01,670
There's always someone inside me
saying, "Things aren't that easy."

461
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:03,380
I'm not very nice.

462
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,490
Hey! Tsukishima!

463
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,450
Moon lets you pet him?

464
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,120
Moon, you're not coming in?

465
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,790
Is that his name?

466
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:40,870
He's like a full moon.

467
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,540
That's why I call him that.

468
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,050
Isn't he yours?

469
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:51,970
He won't stay in one house.

470
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:55,510
I heard him being called Ball at one place.

471
00:47:55,545 --> 00:47:57,810
I'm sure there's others.

472
00:47:57,845 --> 00:48:00,480
So he does the rounds.

473
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,980
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

474
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:06,480
The train?

475
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,280
Yes, by himself!
That's how I came here. I followed him.

476
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,280
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.

477
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,410
I insulted him.

478
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:23,790
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.

479
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,630
You're not like Moon at all!

480
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,300
He's half-devil...

481
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,560
- Um...
- Would you?

482
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,230
Is your grandfather all right?
The store's been closed and I thought...

483
00:48:47,265 --> 00:48:51,320
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.

484
00:48:51,355 --> 00:48:53,320
I'm glad he's all right.

485
00:48:53,355 --> 00:48:57,370
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?

486
00:48:57,405 --> 00:49:00,450
That cat doll?
You want to see it? Come on.

487
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:12,220
Close the door.

488
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,820
It's like we're in the sky!

489
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,710
Afraid of heights?

490
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:47,540
No, I like high places. This is great.

491
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,510
This is the time it looks best. In here.

492
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,410
Perfect timing.

493
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,910
Sit there.

494
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:25,910
The clock's gone!

495
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,580
The one that was there?

496
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:32,420
Grandpa's delivering it today.

497
00:50:32,455 --> 00:50:33,550
Did he sell it?

498
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,420
It was here being fixed.

499
00:50:36,455 --> 00:50:39,550
I wanted to see it again.

500
00:50:39,585 --> 00:50:43,520
It took three years. He finished it
the day you forgot your lunch.

501
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:45,060
That lunch!

502
00:50:45,095 --> 00:50:47,980
I know it wasn't yours.

503
00:50:48,015 --> 00:50:49,650
Look into the cat's eyes.

504
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,980
Quick, before the light goes.

505
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,710
<i>Engelzimmer: "angel's room."</i>

506
00:51:10,745 --> 00:51:14,090
The artisan accidentally
scratched it with a cloth.

507
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,960
It's beautiful.

508
00:51:15,995 --> 00:51:18,970
The Baron won't go. He's a treasure.

509
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,590
A treasure?

510
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,180
It means something to him.
He won't say what, though.

511
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:29,440
Look as long as you like.
I'll be downstairs.

512
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:35,400
Turn on the light if you want.

513
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:53,920
It's weird. I feel
as if I've known you for years.

514
00:51:53,955 --> 00:51:56,210
Sometimes I really want to see you.

515
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,600
You look sad today, somehow.

516
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,080
- Had enough?
- Yeah. Thanks.

517
00:53:10,115 --> 00:53:12,750
Are you making a violin?

518
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,870
Uh, yeah.

519
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,540
Can I see?

520
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,630
It fits like this.

521
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,890
You made all that? By hand?

522
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,520
- Sure!
- Amazing!

523
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:34,940
The shape hasn't changed
in 300 years.

524
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:38,150
The sound comes
from the craftsman's skill.

525
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:41,820
You made all those?

526
00:53:41,855 --> 00:53:45,570
No way!
There's a violin-making class here.

527
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,200
- But one of them is yours?
- Yeah.

528
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,910
- Which one?
- That one.

529
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:54,790
This one?

530
00:53:54,825 --> 00:53:59,750
Wow! You made this? It's like magic!

531
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,920
How can you talk like that
with a straight face?

532
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,430
Why? It's what I think.

533
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,260
Anyone can do that.

534
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,180
I've got a long way to go.

535
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,820
You can play, can't you?

536
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:23,940
A little.

537
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:26,530
Play for me, OK? Please!

538
00:54:26,565 --> 00:54:27,950
Listen...

539
00:54:27,985 --> 00:54:30,200
Please, please, please!

540
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,080
You have to sing too.

541
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:36,920
Me? I'm tone-deaf!

542
00:54:36,955 --> 00:54:38,500
Perfect!

543
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,270
Sing. You know this song.

544
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:27,170
<i>Had a dream of living on my own</i>

545
00:55:27,205 --> 00:55:32,640
<i>With no fear of being all alone</i>

546
00:55:32,675 --> 00:55:37,560
<i>Pushed my sadness down inside of me</i>

547
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:42,610
<i>And pretended
I was strong as I could be</i>

548
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:48,070
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

549
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:53,660
<i>If you go right to the end</i>

550
00:55:53,695 --> 00:55:59,460
<i>Got a feeling it'll take me</i>

551
00:55:59,495 --> 00:56:04,420
<i>To that town, country road</i>

552
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,970
<i>It doesn't matter to me
how sad I might be</i>

553
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:16,510
<i>I will never ever let
a tear show in my eye</i>

554
00:56:16,545 --> 00:56:22,440
<i>If my feet are moving faster
that's because I only want to</i>

555
00:56:22,475 --> 00:56:27,030
<i>Push away memories</i>

556
00:56:27,065 --> 00:56:32,530
<i>Country road, this old road</i>

557
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:38,080
<i>Could go right to my hometown</i>

558
00:56:38,115 --> 00:56:43,630
<i>I won't go there, I can't go there</i>

559
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:49,460
<i>Can't go down that country road</i>

560
00:56:49,495 --> 00:56:54,800
<i>Country road, when tomorrow comes</i>

561
00:56:54,835 --> 00:57:00,640
<i>I'll be like I always am</i>

562
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:05,980
<i>Want to go back there
Can't go back there</i>

563
00:57:06,015 --> 00:57:08,480
<i>Fare thee well</i>

564
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,070
<i>Country road</i>

565
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,480
That was fun!

566
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,070
I'm Tsukishima Shizuku.
We met the other day.

567
00:57:56,870 --> 00:58:00,740
I was hoping you'd come back again.

568
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,830
These are my musical friends.

569
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:06,330
Nice singing.

570
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:10,130
You're the lucky one who was there
when he fixed the clock.

571
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:13,130
Seiji-kun has some pretty friends.

572
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,430
Seiji? Are you Amasawa Seiji?

573
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:21,930
Yeah. Didn't I tell you my name?

574
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:25,140
No! It says Nishi outside.

575
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,650
That's Grandpa's name. I'm Amasawa.

576
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:34,990
Oh, no! First I was buried alive,
and now the sky's fallen in!

577
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:38,780
What difference does it make
what my name is?

578
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:42,450
A lot! You've been calling me
by my full name!

579
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,750
You never asked me mine!

580
00:58:44,785 --> 00:58:46,460
I never had the chance!

581
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,460
My image of Amasawa Seiji...

582
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,630
What?

583
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,670
...was someone quiet and gentle.

584
00:58:53,705 --> 00:58:55,920
You read too many books.

585
00:58:55,955 --> 00:58:57,970
So do you!

586
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,860
That was fun. They're nice people.

587
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,030
Come back. They'll like that.

588
00:59:20,065 --> 00:59:22,910
Just to listen. Singing's too hard.

589
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:27,620
But you're a good violinist.
Is that what you want to do?

590
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,830
There's lots as good as me.

591
00:59:30,865 --> 00:59:34,000
What I want to do is make violins.

592
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:36,630
Yeah. You're good at that.

593
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,760
There's a school for it
in Cremona, Italy.

594
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,640
I want to go there.

595
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,140
And not go to high school?

596
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:52,650
My parents are dead against it.
Grandpa's my only ally.

597
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,830
It must be great
to know what you want to do.

598
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:13,130
I've got no idea at all.
I just go from one day to the next.

599
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:18,470
I don't know if I can go or not.
I fight with my parents every day.

600
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:24,180
Even if I go, I won't know
if I have the talent until I try.

601
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,930
I'll see you home.

602
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:31,810
No, it's not far. See you.

603
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,690
Tsukishima...

604
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,690
Yeah?

605
01:00:36,725 --> 01:00:38,740
You've got a talent for poetry.

606
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,950
<i>What you sang back there was fine,
but I liked Concrete Roads too.</i>

607
01:00:43,985 --> 01:00:46,790
You told me to forget that!

608
01:00:46,825 --> 01:00:49,660
- Did I say that?
- Yes!

609
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,410
I did?

610
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:55,960
Thanks for everything. Good night.

611
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,150
Don't fall asleep
with the light on again.

612
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,160
When did you decide on your future?

613
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:30,410
What?

614
01:01:30,445 --> 01:01:31,750
Your future!

615
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,620
Isn't yours Suginomiya High?

616
01:01:34,655 --> 01:01:36,500
I don't mean that!

617
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,590
I'm at university finding that out.

618
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:42,800
Good night.

619
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,300
Good night.

620
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,240
Mom's class is canceled,
so now she sleeps in!

621
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,250
- Morning!
- Morning!

622
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,670
Run faster!

623
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,540
You go ahead!

624
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,270
Note: Hour 1: Spare Period

625
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,230
Great!

626
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,570
Shizuku!

627
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,440
You look awful!

628
01:02:42,475 --> 01:02:45,400
You sure got better fast!

629
01:02:45,435 --> 01:02:48,160
I hear you were out
with a boy last night.

630
01:02:48,195 --> 01:02:50,280
Who told you that?!

631
01:02:50,315 --> 01:02:53,290
A little bird who said
you were like lovers.

632
01:02:53,325 --> 01:02:54,500
We are not!

633
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,880
Harada, I'll tell my friend
the answer's no. Sorry.

634
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:09,890
I'm sorry too.

635
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,350
That's OK.

636
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,600
Did you see Sasuke on TV last night?
It was great!

637
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,030
This formula will be
on the midterm, so remember it!

638
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:33,990
That's all!

639
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,980
Is Tsukishima here?

640
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:59,640
Amasawa? What do you want?

641
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,810
Is Tsukishima in this class?

642
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:05,230
Tsukishima? Yeah, she's here.

643
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,190
Tsukishima! You've got a visitor!

644
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,030
A male!

645
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:15,490
There she is.

646
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,120
Seiji-kun?

647
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,670
Can I talk to you?

648
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:24,090
Yes!

649
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:27,210
Tsukishima's got a boyfriend!

650
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:33,390
No, I don't!

651
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,980
What is it?

652
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:45,360
- I'm going to Italy.
- What?

653
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:47,320
Come with me.

654
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,870
- Where are we going?
- The roof!

655
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,420
Wow!

656
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:07,960
We can't talk
with all those people around.

657
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,630
Sorry. I wanted to tell you first.

658
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,640
Let them think what they want.

659
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,890
My dad finally gave in.
On one condition.

660
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,900
What's that?

661
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,070
I apprentice in a workshop there
for two months.

662
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:31,190
Apprentice?

663
01:05:31,225 --> 01:05:35,910
The guy who runs it is very strict.
He'll see if I have talent or not.

664
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,910
Also if I have the patience
to stick it out.

665
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:43,040
Otherwise I go to high school.

666
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,960
I hate that they're leaving
an escape route...

667
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:48,920
...but it's a good chance.

668
01:05:48,955 --> 01:05:50,550
When do you go?

669
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:55,430
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad's talking to the school today.

670
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,260
Soon then.

671
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,140
Great! Your dream's coming true.

672
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:04,230
Well, I'll do the best I can.

673
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:07,860
- Um...
- Well...

674
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,450
- The rain's stopping.
- Yeah.

675
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,950
Look over there.

676
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:23,460
There might be a rainbow.

677
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,680
What's Cremona like? I hope it's nice.

678
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:45,690
It's an old town,
with lots of violin makers.

679
01:06:45,725 --> 01:06:49,400
It's great. You're on your way.

680
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,150
I feel like a fool.

681
01:06:52,185 --> 01:06:55,530
I was hoping we'd go
to the same high school.

682
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,450
What a stupid thing to think.

683
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:21,510
I saw your name on the library cards
a long time ago.

684
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,890
We passed each other in the library.

685
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,520
I even sat beside you there.

686
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:36,360
I read all kinds of books so my name
would be on the cards before yours.

687
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,530
I...

688
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:44,450
I'll sing your song to myself in Italy.

689
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,420
Me too.

690
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,170
Don't push!

691
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,100
Hey!

692
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:06,720
Look out, she's mad!

693
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:10,020
Run!

694
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,640
- Here.
- Thanks.

695
01:08:45,675 --> 01:08:46,720
Excuse me.

696
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:49,560
Finished already?

697
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:51,940
I'm meeting Yuko.

698
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,230
If you're by the station, get some milk.

699
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,700
You're the one who drinks it all!

700
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,910
She's slacking off these days.

701
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,180
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- It's OK.

702
01:09:28,215 --> 01:09:29,930
My head's in a whirl.

703
01:09:30,890 --> 01:09:33,730
- Hello, Shizuku-chan.
- Hello.

704
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,530
- Welcome back.
- Hello.

705
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,660
I'll make some tea.

706
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,280
Dad and I aren't speaking.

707
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,130
Boys are so lucky!

708
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:04,510
When he comes back to graduate,
he goes again for ten years!

709
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:06,720
That's like forever!

710
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,560
But it's like fate
brought you together! Cool!

711
01:10:11,595 --> 01:10:16,690
It's too good to last.
Two people read the same books,

712
01:10:16,725 --> 01:10:20,230
except one's going forward
while the other stays behind.

713
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:22,400
Yeah.

714
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:26,820
Kinu-chan was in his class for a year.

715
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:31,290
She said he was hard to get to know,
but good-looking and smart.

716
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:35,870
Don't tell me that, will you!

717
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:37,250
I just feel worse!

718
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:41,380
Why? He likes you, doesn't he?
He told you!

719
01:10:41,415 --> 01:10:43,380
Now I'm not so sure.

720
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:52,390
I don't get it. I'd write every
day. We'd encourage each other.

721
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,400
You can't say "Go for it"
to someone more ambitious than you.

722
01:10:57,435 --> 01:10:59,020
Maybe...

723
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,990
But I don't understand what you want.

724
01:11:04,025 --> 01:11:07,240
Can't you be in love
without your future planned out?

725
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,830
You have talent.

726
01:11:11,865 --> 01:11:15,370
<i>All the juniors liked
your translation of Country Roads.</i>

727
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,290
You can express yourself too,
unlike me.

728
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,010
"There's lots as good as me."

729
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:26,590
That's what he said.

730
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:30,510
He's going to find out
if he has talent. Well, so will I!

731
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,890
I'll write a story!

732
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:39,440
There's one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.

733
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,320
But it's exam time.

734
01:11:42,355 --> 01:11:46,320
I don't care. Thanks, Yuko.
I feel empowered.

735
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,240
- You going?
- Yeah.

736
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,410
Good night.

737
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,790
Tell your mother hello.

738
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,040
You go for it too.

739
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:06,880
Sugimura will realize. Bye.

740
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,340
Bye.

741
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:14,350
It's so easy!
I just have to do something too!

742
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,520
Moon?

743
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,730
Muta?

744
01:12:25,765 --> 01:12:28,990
Mom! Muta's gone again!

745
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,570
Muta!

746
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:32,820
Muta...

747
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:41,420
Note: 'Whisper of the Heart': Listen
to the voice of the woods...

748
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,860
The Baron as the hero?

749
01:13:09,530 --> 01:13:11,200
Would you mind?

750
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:16,530
I ask because Seiji-kun says
the doll is a treasure of yours.

751
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,870
You didn't have to ask.

752
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,130
Of course you can.
But on one condition.

753
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,590
Yes?

754
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:31,880
That you let me be the first person
to read your story.

755
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,800
Um...

756
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,050
All right?

757
01:13:36,085 --> 01:13:41,140
Do I have to? I don't know
if I can write it or not.

758
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,940
It's the same for a craftsman.

759
01:13:46,975 --> 01:13:50,240
Don't expect perfection at first.

760
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:53,200
Here, let me show you something.

761
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:01,120
This.

762
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,630
Look at it.

763
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:17,640
It's called mica slate.

764
01:14:17,675 --> 01:14:19,970
Look at the seam.

765
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,230
Like that.

766
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,860
It's beautiful!

767
01:14:34,895 --> 01:14:39,660
It's called beryl.
You find it in emerald ore.

768
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,290
- Emerald? The jewel?
- Yes.

769
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:46,540
You and Seiji are like this stone.

770
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,000
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

771
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,800
I like stones that way.

772
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:58,340
But making violins
or writing stories is different.

773
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:03,890
The rough stone is inside you.
You have to find it and then polish it.

774
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,600
It takes time and effort.

775
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:10,570
You see the ore that makes up
most of that stone?

776
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,320
Yes.

777
01:15:12,355 --> 01:15:17,320
You could polish that,
but what you'd get would be worthless.

778
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:21,080
The smaller part inside is purer.

779
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:27,080
There might even be a better stone
deep inside where we can't see.

780
01:15:27,115 --> 01:15:31,250
I'm sorry. Old people like to preach.

781
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:37,380
I'm scared. What if there
isn't a beautiful crystal in me?

782
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:42,640
But I want to write.
And you'll be the first one to see it.

783
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:45,390
Thank you. I'll look forward to it.

784
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:57,900
A rough stone... lapis lazuli...

785
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,240
Let us go forth together

786
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:07,870
in search of the treasure
of lapis lazuli!

787
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,340
Have no fear. Space is deformed
on the night of the new moon.

788
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:20,680
Faraway things loom large,
nearby things look small.

789
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,180
Fly! We will rise on the updraft.

790
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:36,230
Make haste! The planetoids converge!

791
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:50,830
Good! We're riding the wind!

792
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,290
Straight up to that castle!

793
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:56,710
It's so high!

794
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:59,550
It's not so high once you're there!

795
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:23,240
When the air currents mingle in the
afternoon, you can touch the stars!

796
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,240
Huh?

797
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:35,710
That's rare.
Shizuku looking at non-fiction...

798
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,590
He's making a violin in his cell.

799
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,000
Seiji-kun!

800
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:55,290
I thought you'd gone!

801
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:58,130
Grandpa said I might find you here.

802
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:01,920
Glad I met you before. I leave tomorrow.

803
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:03,760
Tomorrow...

804
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,970
Don't worry.
I'll wait here till you're done.

805
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:38,420
Sorry I can't walk you home.

806
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:41,630
That's OK. I'm glad you came.

807
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,470
I can't come to the airport,
but I'll wait for you.

808
01:19:45,505 --> 01:19:47,550
Yeah. It's only two months.

809
01:19:54,430 --> 01:20:00,020
I'm sorry I'm always so depressing.
I'll do my best while you're gone.

810
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,360
I'll see you, then.

811
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,410
Have a good trip!

812
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:37,730
I and Luisa, my betrothed,
were born in a distant land.

813
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,320
<i>In that town, magic still lived,</i>

814
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,660
<i>and in the veins of its artisans
flowed the blood of sorcerers.</i>

815
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,670
<i>It was a poor doll maker's
apprentice who fashioned us,</i>

816
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,960
<i>but Luisa and I were happy</i>

817
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:11,930
<i>because he had made us
so we could love others.</i>

818
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:14,640
<i>But then...</i>

819
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,310
Shizuku! Shizuku!

820
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,280
Shizuku!

821
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,910
What's going on? Tsukishima!

822
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,790
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

823
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:39,500
Pay attention! This is important!

824
01:21:39,535 --> 01:21:40,620
Sorry, sir.

825
01:21:40,655 --> 01:21:42,870
Harada, you read.

826
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,300
You were up until four again?!

827
01:21:48,335 --> 01:21:51,130
It's OK. I'm not sleepy at all.

828
01:21:51,165 --> 01:21:56,220
But you're spaced out all the time.
Like just now...

829
01:21:56,255 --> 01:22:00,890
I was thinking. I've got
to organize what I want to write.

830
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:04,810
I'm not hungry.

831
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,930
Shizuku? So, you are home.

832
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,680
Turn on the lights!

833
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,680
At least you could bring in the laundry!

834
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:46,190
Shizuku! Come here!

835
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,530
Shizuku's here, isn't she?

836
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:53,530
She's not hungry.

837
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:21,600
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.

838
01:23:21,635 --> 01:23:25,100
This way.
Is anyone in the guidance office?

839
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:27,810
Please.

840
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,280
I'm home!

841
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:39,660
Welcome back.

842
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:42,290
You're home early, Shiho.

843
01:23:43,870 --> 01:23:46,370
I'm beat!

844
01:23:46,405 --> 01:23:48,750
- Want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

845
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:55,170
Mom, can I talk to you?

846
01:23:55,205 --> 01:23:56,220
What?

847
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,640
I'm thinking of moving out.

848
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,600
- I've found a place.
- But can you afford it?

849
01:24:08,635 --> 01:24:11,020
I've saved from my job.

850
01:24:11,055 --> 01:24:14,400
I found another one
at a cram school. I'll get by.

851
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:19,200
I guess I've made you help me out
too much around here.

852
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:22,330
I'll talk to your father.

853
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,950
You will? Great!

854
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:31,420
Money's tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working,

855
01:24:31,455 --> 01:24:33,590
but I'll help you out then.

856
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,460
Sounds good.

857
01:24:35,495 --> 01:24:38,420
Sorry to go during your master's thesis.

858
01:24:38,455 --> 01:24:40,140
Thanks.

859
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:44,060
You helped enough just
with sorting out data.

860
01:24:44,095 --> 01:24:49,690
And Shizuku can concentrate
in her own room. She's acting weird.

861
01:24:49,725 --> 01:24:51,310
You think so too?

862
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,650
The school called me. Look at this.

863
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:57,530
What is it?

864
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:01,870
She's gone down a hundred places!

865
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:07,040
She's at her desk all the time.
What's she doing?

866
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,920
- Good evening.
- Hello.

867
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:21,800
Excuse me.

868
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:30,980
What high school will take you
with marks like this?!

869
01:25:31,015 --> 01:25:33,520
I'm not going to high school!

870
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:39,400
Not going to high school?  Use your head! What can you do
with a middle school education?

871
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:42,030
I can decide my own future!

872
01:25:42,065 --> 01:25:43,620
Don't get too cocky!

873
01:25:43,655 --> 01:25:48,120
Face the facts! The school makes
its report on you after the second term!

874
01:25:48,155 --> 01:25:50,540
You're a fine one to talk!

875
01:25:50,575 --> 01:25:53,500
You don't study!
You just work part-time!

876
01:25:53,535 --> 01:25:55,790
I do what I have to!

877
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:00,590
You're the one who isn't doing that.
Don't you understand?

878
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:05,050
I've got something more important to do!

879
01:26:05,085 --> 01:26:07,930
Like what? Tell me.

880
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,560
Shiho, Shizuku, that's enough.

881
01:26:12,595 --> 01:26:15,860
But Dad, listen to this girl!

882
01:26:15,895 --> 01:26:19,440
Both of you come out here
and tell me about it.

883
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:21,900
Shizuku, change out of your uniform.

884
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:26,070
Come on.

885
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,050
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?

886
01:26:44,085 --> 01:26:46,260
I never said I wouldn't care about my marks!

887
01:26:46,295 --> 01:26:48,970
You just said you
weren't going to high school.

888
01:26:49,005 --> 01:26:51,640
You said I wouldn't get into one!

889
01:26:51,675 --> 01:26:56,230
Shiho, can Shizuku
and I talk alone for a bit?

890
01:26:56,265 --> 01:26:58,060
Yes.

891
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,530
- Where's your mother?
- At the Tanakas.

892
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:06,490
- I'm back.
- Hi, Mom.

893
01:27:06,525 --> 01:27:08,490
- Is your dad back?
- Yes.

894
01:27:08,525 --> 01:27:13,120
Could you come here, Asako?
I've been hearing about Shizuku.

895
01:27:13,155 --> 01:27:14,250
Coming.

896
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,920
All right, Shizuku.

897
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:28,430
Is what you're doing now
more important than studying?

898
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,600
Can you tell me what it is?

899
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,100
When it's time.

900
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:40,440
Is this something
you have to do right away?

901
01:27:40,475 --> 01:27:43,570
I've only got three weeks left to do it!

902
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:47,490
I'm testing myself.

903
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,450
I have to.

904
01:27:49,485 --> 01:27:52,830
Testing yourself? How?

905
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:56,540
How will we know if you don't say?

906
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:01,630
Is it something you can't even tell us?

907
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:06,170
- Dear!
- Oh, sorry. Just one moment.

908
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:20,770
Whatever you're doing at the library,

909
01:28:20,805 --> 01:28:22,360
I admire how hard you're working.

910
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:26,570
Let's let her do what she wants.

911
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:30,320
Not everyone has to be the same.

912
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:37,000
I should know that if anyone does...

913
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:41,170
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

914
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:46,260
But it's not easy
when you walk your own road.

915
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:49,720
You've only got yourself to blame.

916
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:54,890
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

917
01:28:54,925 --> 01:28:57,810
- Yeah. We're a family.
- Yes.

918
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:59,890
Call Shiho.

919
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,730
I'll make some tea.

920
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:08,740
Shizuku.

921
01:29:10,610 --> 01:29:14,870
I know what Dad said, but what
he really wants is for you to study.

922
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:17,830
I know. It's written on his face.

923
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:21,620
I'm moving out next Sunday.

924
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,250
You'll have your own room.

925
01:29:24,285 --> 01:29:26,170
You're leaving home?

926
01:29:26,205 --> 01:29:28,300
Yep. So, smarten up!

927
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:40,270
Hurry!

928
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,810
Hurry!

929
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:46,650
Only one is real.

930
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:49,530
Which is the real one?!

931
01:29:49,565 --> 01:29:51,860
Hurry! Hurry!

932
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,160
Hurry!

933
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:38,180
Luisa, you've finally come,
but I've grown so old.

934
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,460
Shizuku-san.

935
01:32:06,495 --> 01:32:10,630
Come in. I was fast asleep.

936
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:16,670
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've brought my story.

937
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:23,100
It's finished?

938
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:28,770
You promised you'd be
the first to read it.

939
01:32:28,805 --> 01:32:31,020
It's a novel!

940
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:34,400
Note: Whisper of the Heart

941
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:39,410
Can you read it now?
I'll wait as long as it takes.

942
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:44,910
But you've worked so hard on it.
Shouldn't I take my time?

943
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:50,540
You can stop if you don't like it.
I hate to ask, but...

944
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,750
My heart's pounding.

945
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:57,220
I see. I'll read it right now.

946
01:32:57,255 --> 01:33:00,720
Come sit by the fire. It's cold.

947
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:07,890
Now we won't be bothered.

948
01:33:12,270 --> 01:33:16,070
Can I wait downstairs?

949
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:18,820
It's OK. I'm not cold at all.

950
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:24,330
Of course, but...

951
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,440
You're asleep here?

952
01:34:39,475 --> 01:34:41,610
Shizuku-san, I'm finished.

953
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:46,620
Thank you. It's very good.

954
01:34:46,655 --> 01:34:48,660
It's not!

955
01:34:48,695 --> 01:34:49,120
Say what you really think!
I couldn't write what I wanted!

956
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:56,040
The last half doesn't make sense.
I know that!

957
01:34:56,075 --> 01:35:00,090
Yes, it's rough, blunt, unfinished,

958
01:35:00,125 --> 01:35:02,260
just like Seiji's violin.

959
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:10,520
You've shown me the rough stone
you've just cut out of the rock.

960
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:14,520
You've worked hard. You're wonderful.

961
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:20,360
There's no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.

962
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,640
It's cold out here. Come inside.

963
01:35:48,675 --> 01:35:50,180
Now...

964
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:53,520
Now that I've written it I know.

965
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,600
Wanting isn't enough.

966
01:35:56,635 --> 01:35:59,230
I have to learn more,

967
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:05,280
but Seiji-kun's getting
further and further ahead.

968
01:36:05,315 --> 01:36:09,700
I felt that I had to force myself
to write, and I was so scared.

969
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:15,000
You like Seiji, do you?

970
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:37,350
How is it?

971
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,690
It's very good.

972
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:47,110
When Seiji finished his first violin,
we had ramen noodles.

973
01:36:47,145 --> 01:36:48,910
Jumbo size.

974
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:55,410
Thank you.

975
01:36:57,460 --> 01:37:00,420
Now, where was I?

976
01:37:00,455 --> 01:37:03,630
You found the Baron in a coffee shop when you were a student in Germany...

977
01:37:04,380 --> 01:37:05,840
Yes, yes.

978
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:11,850
He looked so melancholic.

979
01:37:11,885 --> 01:37:15,060
I asked the owner to sell him to me.

980
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:18,020
But he wouldn't.

981
01:37:18,055 --> 01:37:23,110
The Baron had a lover,
and he wouldn't separate them.

982
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:29,950
He was waiting for her to come back
from being repaired

983
01:37:29,985 --> 01:37:31,780
at the doll maker's shop.

984
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:36,040
Just like in my story!

985
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:39,870
Yes, quite the coincidence.

986
01:37:39,905 --> 01:37:44,000
I had to come home,
so I'd just about given up.

987
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:48,260
Then a lady friend of mine

988
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:52,680
<i>said when the other doll
came back, she would take it</i>

989
01:37:52,715 --> 01:37:55,680
<i>and bring the two dolls together.</i>

990
01:37:55,715 --> 01:37:58,060
<i>So the owner gave in.</i>

991
01:37:58,770 --> 01:38:02,690
<i>So I ended up leaving Germany
with just the Baron.</i>

992
01:38:02,725 --> 01:38:09,070
<i>I promised her I'd come back,
and asked her to keep the other doll.</i>

993
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:13,530
<i>The day the dolls met again</i>

994
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:18,080
<i>would be the day we did.</i>

995
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:24,250
But then the war started,
and I couldn't keep my promise.

996
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:31,090
When I was finally able to go back,
I looked all over for her.

997
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:37,510
But there was no trace of her
or the Baron's lover.

998
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:42,020
She must have been
very important to you.

999
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:46,480
Your story brought the Baron
out of my memory

1000
01:38:46,515 --> 01:38:49,480
and back to life.

1001
01:38:49,515 --> 01:38:51,240
Oh, yes.

1002
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,580
Hold out your hand.

1003
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:09,050
But...

1004
01:39:09,085 --> 01:39:13,300
That stone suits you perfectly.
I'll give it to you.

1005
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:17,890
Now, finish up your story.

1006
01:39:17,925 --> 01:39:18,890
Yes.

1007
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:36,200
Thank you!

1008
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:41,740
Goodbye!

1009
01:39:52,170 --> 01:39:53,260
I'm home.

1010
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,090
Welcome back.

1011
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,930
Where's Dad?

1012
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:03,180
In the bath.
Where have you been till this hour?

1013
01:40:03,215 --> 01:40:08,730
Sorry I worried you. Today I return
to studying for my entrance exams.

1014
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:11,730
So, your trials are over?

1015
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:13,610
For now.

1016
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:18,110
Did you eat? There's curry.

1017
01:40:18,145 --> 01:40:19,030
I'm fine!

1018
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:22,580
"For now."

1019
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:35,170
Shizuku, the bath's open.

1020
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:56,950
Ah, a soldier at ease.

1021
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:04,800
No way!

1022
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:14,360
Wait there!

1023
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,960
It's a miracle! You're here!

1024
01:42:31,995 --> 01:42:33,670
We're not dreaming?

1025
01:42:33,705 --> 01:42:37,090
I got an earlier plane. Hop on.

1026
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:40,840
Wait, you'll be cold.

1027
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,340
Climb on.

1028
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,060
I'll get a coat.

1029
01:42:47,095 --> 01:42:49,220
No time! Get on.

1030
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,600
Hang on tight.

1031
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:02,740
I was out there calling you in my head.

1032
01:43:02,775 --> 01:43:04,450
"Shizuku!"

1033
01:43:04,485 --> 01:43:08,280
And then you appeared!

1034
01:43:08,315 --> 01:43:09,620
What a team we are!

1035
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:14,750
Me too. It's like I'm still dreaming!

1036
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:22,090
How was Cremona?

1037
01:43:22,125 --> 01:43:25,640
A lot different than I thought.
But I'm going to do it.

1038
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,850
It's getting light!

1039
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:39,400
- Shall I get off?
- It's OK.

1040
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:45,860
I made up my mind
I was going to ride you up this hill!

1041
01:43:45,895 --> 01:43:47,570
That's not fair!

1042
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:52,450
I'm no man's burden!

1043
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:59,170
I want to be of use!

1044
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:02,210
OK! Push!

1045
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:04,170
Almost there!

1046
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:21,610
Shizuku! Jump on!

1047
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,040
We made it!

1048
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:48,260
- I'll hold the coat.
- It's OK.

1049
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:52,640
Here...

1050
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:13,490
Wow! In the mist it looks
just like the sea!

1051
01:45:13,525 --> 01:45:17,580
This is my secret place.
It's almost time.

1052
01:46:02,330 --> 01:46:04,540
I wanted you to see this.

1053
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:11,010
Grandpa told me everything.

1054
01:46:11,045 --> 01:46:15,510
I didn't do anything to help.
I was just thinking of myself.

1055
01:46:15,545 --> 01:46:18,680
No, you were the reason I did it.

1056
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,650
I'm glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.

1057
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:30,320
I'm going to study hard
and go on to high school.

1058
01:46:30,355 --> 01:46:32,780
Listen, Shizuku.

1059
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:37,540
I can't say how soon it'll be, but...

1060
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:40,460
...would you marry me?

1061
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:46,090
I'm going to be a violin maker
and then...

1062
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,590
You mean it?

1063
01:46:52,625 --> 01:46:55,800
That's exactly what I wanted.

1064
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:58,100
Yeah? Great!
