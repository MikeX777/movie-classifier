Don't worry about it, gentlemen.
We got insurance.

1885
01:28:03,476 --> 01:28:05,307
But, Dean Higgins,
it's new equipment

1886
01:28:05,378 --> 01:28:07,073
Like this
electroheliospectrograph

1887
01:28:07,147 --> 01:28:09,115
that's going to put Medfield
on the map.

1888
01:28:09,182 --> 01:28:11,650
Oh, really, Quigley --
an electroheliospectrogram?

1889
01:28:11,718 --> 01:28:12,650
Graph, sir.

1890
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:13,981
Well, graph. Whatever.

1891
01:28:14,054 --> 01:28:16,284
Everybody knows that I am
all for progress,

1892
01:28:16,356 --> 01:28:17,618
but there are limits.

1893
01:28:17,691 --> 01:28:20,717
You wanted a computer,
we got you a computer.

1894
01:28:20,794 --> 01:28:24,423
Now, I'll admit, I was a little
bit reluctant at first,

1895
01:28:24,497 --> 01:28:26,192
but we've got to remember,

1896
01:28:26,266 --> 01:28:29,599
we can't do everything
that a state school can do.

1897
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:31,830
Now, there's Collingsgood,
sitting over there

1898
01:28:31,905 --> 01:28:35,102
in the lap of luxury
with all that tax money,

1899
01:28:35,175 --> 01:28:37,302
building, building, building,

1900
01:28:37,377 --> 01:28:39,937
It's disgusting --
all that building!

1901
01:28:40,013 --> 01:28:41,810
I tell you, the trials

1902
01:28:41,882 --> 01:28:43,816
and tribulations
of administration

1903
01:28:43,884 --> 01:28:46,751
weigh heavily on one today.

1904
01:28:49,055 --> 01:28:52,889
It's not easy to be a dean
in a private school today.

1905
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:54,824
It's tough, tough, tough.

1906
01:28:56,529 --> 01:28:59,089
There they are again.

1907
01:28:59,165 --> 01:29:02,623
Every time we meet, they meet.

1908
01:29:02,702 --> 01:29:06,399
Maybe I can find out from
the gardener what's going on.

1909
01:29:06,473 --> 01:29:08,464
Oh, uh, strike that,
Winifred.

1910
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:10,532
No, I'm --
I'm sorry, Quigley.

1911

The helioelectrospectrograph
is out.

Electroheliospectrograph.

1913
01:29:14,347 --> 01:29:15,746
Well, whatever it is,
it's out.

1914
01:29:15,815 --> 01:29:16,975
-- It's, uh -- gram?
-- Graph.

1915
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:18,278
Graph. Out.

1916
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:20,046
Gentlemen,
I've made a decision

1917
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,486
on what we're going to do
with our award money.

1918
01:29:22,555 --> 01:29:24,921
As you know, the building
and loan associations

1919
01:29:24,991 --> 01:29:27,425
are paying an excellent rate
of interest.

1920
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:30,952
Now, if we were to put our funds
in one of these institutions,

1921
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:32,931
at the end of, say,
uh, five years,

1922
01:29:32,999 --> 01:29:36,332
the equivalent of interest would
obviously be considerable.

1923
01:29:36,403 --> 01:29:39,099
And at that time I think it
would behoove us

1924
01:29:39,172 --> 01:29:43,233
to look into the long-neglected
plumbing situation.

1925
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:44,800
-- Plumbing?!
-- Plumbing, are you kidding?!

1926
01:29:44,878 --> 01:29:45,810
How do you like that?!

1927
01:29:45,879 --> 01:29:48,040
We kill ourselves
on that program,

1928
01:29:48,114 --> 01:29:51,083
and Higgins wants to spend
the dough on plumbing.

1929
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:53,312
Poor Quig. You know,
we ought to figure a way

1930
01:29:53,386 --> 01:29:54,978
to get him
one of those things.

1931
01:29:55,055 --> 01:29:56,113
Yeah, that's for sure.

1932
01:29:56,189 --> 01:29:57,247
See you later.

1933
01:29:57,324 --> 01:29:58,791
Oh, yeah.
See you later.

1934
01:29:58,858 --> 01:30:03,295
Hey, Dexter, what's an
electroheliospectrogram?

1935
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:04,660
Heck, I don't know.

1936
01:30:04,731 --> 01:30:07,666
I don't know either,
but if we ever get one,

1937
01:30:07,734 --> 01:30:09,998
don't fool around with it,
okay?

1938
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,833
Okay.
