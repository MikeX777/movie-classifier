00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:12,034
Now please hurry up.

356
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:14,310
- Okay, I'll be right back.

357
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:30,137
I've been thinking about you.

358
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,000
Will you forgive me?

359
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,793
Maybe I was unhappy.

360
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Why don't you come here?

361
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:44,137
I love you.

362
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:01,103
- You've got the choice.

363
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:05,000
A life with your French
girl, platinum records.

364
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,482
I've also gotta remind you,

365
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:11,206
you signed a number
of contracts.

366
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:28,137
- Because of your injury, Bobby,

367
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:30,931
you had three serious
knee operations.

368
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:33,689
And it's been more than a
year since your last game.

369
00:28:33,689 --> 00:28:35,586
- [Bobby] That's right.

370
00:28:41,034 --> 00:28:44,931
- And where were you living
when you were playing pro ball?

371
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,965
- Well, I'm still a
professional, you know.

372
00:28:48,965 --> 00:28:51,827
But when I was in the money,

373
00:28:51,827 --> 00:28:54,862
my wife and me had a
nice apartment uptown.

374
00:28:54,862 --> 00:28:57,931
- Has Coach Cassin
been here to see you?

375
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:01,413
- Like I told you before, Mr.
Cassin is a very busy man.

376
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,241
- [Nada] Okay.

377
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,000
What about your wife?

378
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,586
- Well, Roberta,
she moved to LA.

379
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:07,758
I don't see her
very much anymore.

380
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:09,827
But let's get back to football.

381
00:29:09,827 --> 00:29:11,344
- Yes, Bobby.

382
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:14,517
But what have these people, I
mean your friends, your wife,

383
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:18,586
Coach Cassin, what have
they really done for you?

384
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,068
- [Bobby] They gave me a lot
of hope and encouragement.

385
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:23,758
- You're lying.

386
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:25,137
- Come on, Pop.

387
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:27,034
- Who's paying?

388
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,172
This cost me a lot of money.

389
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:31,689
Now, what you gonna do?

390
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:36,172
Quit football or are you
gonna keep on running around?

391
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:37,448
I don't like it.

392
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:40,172
I can't afford to
feed you and work.

393
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,206
I ain't got no money.

394
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:45,517
Cost me a [mumbles]
dollar to raise you.

395
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,620
What the man.

396
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:49,379
You know what you get?

397
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,517
You're tall enough
like [mumbles].

398
00:29:52,517 --> 00:29:53,827
Hello, Johnny Dean.

399
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,413
Well, you get too tall for me.

400
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,655
Go to heaven, follow
the Son of God.

401
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,000
- Come on, don't
listen to this guy.

402
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,344
Don't listen to him, he's crazy.

403
00:30:00,344 --> 00:30:01,172
- [Bobby] What are you doing?

404
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:02,448
Go.

405
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:03,793
- [Bobby's Father]
But this is good.

406
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,310
- [Bobby] Come on, Pop,
now you been drinking.

407
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,689
- What are you doing here?

408
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:09,068
I can't work with you around.

409
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:11,896
- What do you mean?

410
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:13,034
You called me.

411
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,862
- Oh, who's sorry now?

412
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:19,000
Who's sorry now?

413
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:26,689
Let it be, let it be.

414
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:31,758
I'm going home to see my lady.

415
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:47,586
[fast-paced music]

416
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,517
[calm music]

417
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:32,344
- What are you going to
do with all your stuff?

418
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,517
Why don't you put it back?

419
00:31:41,517 --> 00:31:43,517
- I'll leave them there.

420
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:52,241
- Put your things away, please.

421
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,137
- Okay.

422
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:00,103
Each in its place.

423
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,241
[laughs]

424
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,724
[kisses]

425
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:40,896
- What did you do last night?

426
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,965
[slow music]

427
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,034
Billy and Nada.

428
00:33:24,827 --> 00:33:28,137
- I was on stage in
the middle of a song

429
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,965
and I realized that I'd never
be able to create an audience

430
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:39,517
of feelings that
inspire the songs.

431
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:49,758
They were drawn there like
the crowd around a car wreck

432
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:52,206
and I'd never be able to
make it in a different time.

433
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:57,206
I always felt that way but it
just suddenly got intolerable.

434
00:33:58,689 --> 00:34:02,448
I mean, the thing is, who'd
even want to feel like me?

435
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:03,275
I don't.

436
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:06,517
- Did you get any money?

437
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:09,034
[laughs]

438
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:13,137
- That was all my rights
and royalties, everything.

439
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:15,068
Are you happy now?

440
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,827
- Who do you love?

441
00:34:16,827 --> 00:34:17,655
- You.

442
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:22,310
- Who do you hate?

443
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:24,068
- You.

444
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:39,000
- At least we got some
publicity out of it.

445
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:47,241
- I don't think he will
abandon his future.

446
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,068
The money is too good.

447
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,241
- Kellerman, that's the problem.

448
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:54,413
He hasn't seen any
of the money so far.

449
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:59,310
[shouting]

450
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:19,482
[knocking]

451
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What are you doing here?

452
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,482
- I've gotta talk to you.

453
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:28,068
- Okay, I'll be
there in a minute.

454
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:29,068
So listen...

455
00:35:42,137 --> 00:35:44,551
[slow music]

456
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:23,137
- I couldn't reach you but I
knew you'd be on your way home.

457
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:25,137
- Yeah, big business.

458
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,655
Got plans.

459
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:28,689
Hurry up, the ferry
arrives in 10 minutes.

460
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:30,586
- I only need a second.

461
00:36:30,586 --> 00:36:33,000
- Listen, these guys,
they're gonna sell you

462
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,517
from coast to coast, and man,
I got you the inside track.

463
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,551
- They've been
selling me for a year.

464
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:39,965
Now I want to sell.

465
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:44,379
My rights, royalties,
everything, you can have them.

466
00:36:44,379 --> 00:36:47,482
I'm trying to sell for 5,000.

467
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:49,724
- How are you going to do that?

468
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:51,862
- What do you mean?

469
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:56,862
- I mean you must be joking,
selling everything for 5,000!

470
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,206
- Listen, Nada.

471
00:36:59,206 --> 00:37:03,689
You told me I should find a
stupid, uncomplicated girl.

472
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,413
Well, maybe you were
talking to yourself.

473
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:07,517
Maybe you should
find another man.

474
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,413
- An uncomplicated man.

475
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:12,275
You're absolutely right.

476
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,862
[calm music]

477
00:38:13,206 --> 00:38:14,137
- Operator?

478
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,206
Could you give me 431-6053?

479
00:38:19,724 --> 00:38:20,551
Thanks.

480
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,517
Hello?

481
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:29,172
Could I talk to Mr. Andy Warhol?

482
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,034
[knocking]

483
00:38:32,034 --> 00:38:34,206
Come in, the door is open!

484
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:43,310
Tell him to call me back in
the Westbury in room 705.

485
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,137
Thanks.

486
00:38:45,586 --> 00:38:47,000
Nice to meet you.

487
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:49,827
- You don't remember?

488
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,758
[kisses]

489
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:53,068
- Five months is a long time.

490
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:56,206
You can't just disappear on me.

491
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:59,275
- French TV gave me a
very good job in New York.

492
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:01,206
- Oh, more interesting?

493
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:04,793
- Why are you so mean to me?

494
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:07,206
Are you in love
with somebody else?

495
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:08,206
- Of course.

496
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:10,793
- I missed you.

497
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:11,620
- Really?

498
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,586
- Come on out of there, Nada,

499
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:31,758
I want you to look
at the mirror.

500
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:34,000
You'll really be surprised.

501
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:02,793
[slow music]

502
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,310
- Billy?

503
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm leaving you now.

504
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:09,413
It's better for you and for me.

505
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:13,275
You're driving me crazy

506
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:17,655
and I'm not the
right woman for you.

507
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:20,379
Don't forget this tape.

508
00:41:20,379 --> 00:41:25,206
It shows the beginning and the
end of an impossible dream.

509
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,551
- Jack Bleaker, please.

510
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,655
- You're a couple
of nice friends.

511
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,068
This is your kind of atmosphere.

512
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:20,931
After a couple days, I'm
sure you'll enjoy it.

513
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:25,689
Like I said, don't
worry about it.

514
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:27,068
All free.

515
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:29,413
Company pays for everything.

516
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,724
What do you think?

517
00:42:33,724 --> 00:42:34,551
Like it?

518
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,103
Hello, Eric.

519
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:42,965
- Hi.

520
00:42:44,655 --> 00:42:46,310
- Here are the keys.

521
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,000
Call me later.

522
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:56,000
And don't forget, she's
already forgotten you.

523
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,827
- Al!

524
00:43:00,724 --> 00:43:03,137
- I got a call from Frankfurt.

525
00:43:03,137 --> 00:43:05,034
- Please, not now.

526
00:43:05,034 --> 00:43:07,931
- Mm-hm, they want
me to come back.

527
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,862
- Don't be such a drag.

528
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,241
- If I don't make
the Warhol interview,

529
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:16,793
they won't pay any
longer the hotel.

530
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:20,448
- [laughs] Well,
perhaps I can help you.

531
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:24,275
If you give me the
number, can call it.

532
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:25,551
- Right now?

533
00:43:25,551 --> 00:43:26,379
- Yes.

534
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,379
- Don't be such a drag.

535
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:02,862
- I got a secret recipe.

536
00:44:02,862 --> 00:44:04,344

00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,344
- That's bullshit, that's dumb.

540
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:15,068
- What do you think
other people should do?

541
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:17,275
- They can do
whatever they want.

542
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:18,103

00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:25,896
Oh, I can't wait any longer.

545
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:30,000
Can you tell him tomorrow to
call me back in the Westbury?

546
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,413
He got my number.

And offer is from
German television.

548
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:37,103
I wanted to make this
interview with Mr. Warhol.

00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:39,862
Well, you just called me!

550

- Lying.

- Are you afraid of anything?

556
00:44:55,413 --> 00:44:56,931
- No.

and I know nothing about it.

611
00:48:47,448 --> 00:48:48,896
Okay.

612
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:51,827
- Mr. Marlowe, you went
from cinema to India

613
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:54,379
and from India to school.

614
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:57,379
- To learn, you
must go to school.

615
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:02,275
Less to the school of life
than to the cinema as school.

616
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:06,379
- [Nada] What is the difference
between cinema and school?

617
00:49:06,379 --> 00:49:09,517
- You don't have to please
the students in school

618
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:12,241
because attendance
is obligatory.

619
00:49:13,413 --> 00:49:16,758
- Do you still have
the desire to escape?

620
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,275
- If you choose to escape,

621
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,689
it can become a full
time profession,

622
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:28,172
leaving no room for growth,
spiritual or intellectual.

623
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:32,689
I think escape is
like a racetrack.

624
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:37,586
Once you have begun, no matter
how fast or how long you go,

625
00:49:39,793 --> 00:49:43,103
you always come back to
the place where you begun.

626
00:49:43,103 --> 00:49:46,172
- Mr. Marlowe, it is said
that the cinema is a place

627
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:47,862
for crime and magic.

628
00:49:51,586 --> 00:49:53,862
What do you think about it?

629
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:03,137
- The crime?

630
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:08,275
Film steals images
from living beings.

631
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:12,000
The pleasure?

632
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:14,793
To show them to others.

633
00:50:15,965 --> 00:50:18,551
- Why do people
go to the cinema?

634
00:50:20,172 --> 00:50:24,620
- The movie theater has
its moment of glory.

635
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,482
One comes to sleep
in a bed of images,

636
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:32,655
to get an eyeful, to blind
oneself in the process.

637
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:38,034
To see too much and
to see too badly.

638
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,068
- What are you doing?

639
00:51:09,068 --> 00:51:12,000

to introduce myself.

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,896
I'm Lizzy Liebenfeld.

641
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,689
- Hi, Lizzy.

642
00:51:15,689 --> 00:51:17,448
- I'm a filmmaker.

643
00:51:17,448 --> 00:51:20,103
This is my first long film.

644
00:51:20,103 --> 00:51:24,517
It's kind of an episodic
film based on chance.

645
00:51:24,517 --> 00:51:29,034
I start with a person and
then I follow that person

646
00:51:29,034 --> 00:51:32,655
until that person runs
into the next person

647
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:37,551
and then when that person goes,
I stay with the new person.

648
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,655
But that person is you now!

649
00:51:47,758 --> 00:51:48,931
Wait a second.

- What's the matter?

653
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:00,551
- Gonna have to make
that last shot again.

654
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:04,344
- Well, your lead needs
a pass through makeup.

655
00:52:08,413 --> 00:52:09,758
- Hi, I'm Lizzy.

656
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,103
Wanna be in my film?

657
00:52:12,103 --> 00:52:13,517
- [All] Yeah.

658
00:52:13,517 --> 00:52:14,827
- Can you be wild?

659
00:52:14,827 --> 00:52:15,931
- [All] Sure.

660
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:21,793

Take off your wig.

663
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,068
- No!

664
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,620
- [Billy] Take off your makeup.

665
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,448
- No.

666
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:32,448
- [Billy] Now take
your hair down.

667
00:53:46,758 --> 00:53:47,586
- Why?

668
00:53:49,034 --> 00:53:53,344
- I'm writing a song called
Young Girls In Funny Makeup.

669
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:58,655
- Could I talk to
Mr. Warhol, please?

670
00:54:00,655 --> 00:54:02,689
No, this Hoffritz from
German television.

671
00:54:02,689 --> 00:54:03,517
I was...

672
00:54:04,931 --> 00:54:06,931
I'm trying to get ahold of
Mr. Warhol since about a week.

673
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:09,655
I'm here in New York now.

674
00:54:09,655 --> 00:54:10,482
Hello?

675
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:15,724
Yeah, I want to talk to
Mr. Warhol, Andy Warhol?

676
00:54:15,724 --> 00:54:18,448
Hoffritz, from
German television.

677
00:54:20,379 --> 00:54:23,275
- Everything you tell me
about her sounds so strange.

678
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:26,413
- She wasn't that
crazy, I guess.

679
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:29,068
- When she was really
interested, she'd never say so.

680
00:54:29,068 --> 00:54:30,551
- What would she do?

681
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:32,068
- An interview.

682
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,103
It was like it had nothing
to do with us personally.

683
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:39,793
She'd make the most intimate
moments look like business.

684
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:43,931
- Maybe she was just scared.

685
00:54:43,931 --> 00:54:47,827
- When she finally left,
she didn't talk to me.

686
00:54:49,172 --> 00:54:53,068
She said goodbye on a tape,
in closeup on herself,

687
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:56,517
and then just vanished.

688
00:54:56,517 --> 00:54:58,793
- Imagine every family
would have a video.

689
00:54:58,793 --> 00:55:00,724
- Giving each family a video,

690
00:55:00,724 --> 00:55:03,034
it's like giving
each family a gun.

691
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:06,344
- How do you know she
went back to Paris?

692
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,862
Maybe she's still in New York.

693
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:11,689
- If Warhol doesn't
call tonight,

694
00:55:11,689 --> 00:55:16,275
I'm gonna cancel the
whole interview and
go back to Germany.

695
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:21,206
- Mr. Kellerman, we're expecting
a really important call,

696
00:55:21,206 --> 00:55:24,724
so could you keep your
conversation short?

698
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:50,206
- You didn't expect me.

699
00:55:50,206 --> 00:55:55,172
I called Harry at the TV studio
to find out where you were.

700
00:55:55,793 --> 00:55:57,206
This is Lizzy.

00:55:57,206 --> 00:55:58,034
- Hi.

- I brought you something.

00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,862
- Oh, wonderful.

704
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:03,965
What's on it?

705
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:05,896

- Look, Kellerman, I
invited you to the party

712
00:56:37,137 --> 00:56:39,137
and you spend all your
time on the phone.

713
00:56:39,137 --> 00:56:43,689
I told you we're expecting
a real important call.

714
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:44,827
Where's your friend?

715
00:56:44,827 --> 00:56:46,068
- I don't know.

716
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:03,965
- What do you think
you're doing here?

717
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:07,896
- We do not think but thought.

718
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:10,724
We are fascinating possessed.

719
00:57:10,724 --> 00:57:14,206
- That's fine, but you're
supposed to be having fun here.

720
00:57:14,206 --> 00:57:16,724
So get yourself under control.

721
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,137
- I never had any control.

722
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:27,000
People come and go
whenever they feel like.

723
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,758
I'm only the manager.

724
00:57:34,103 --> 00:57:35,344
- When I finish shooting it,

725
00:57:35,344 --> 00:57:38,034
I'm gonna blow it
up from eight to 35.

726
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:40,034
- I would never do that.

727
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:44,000
Once you're on 35,
you're a stocking.

728
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:47,724
You've gotta engage
more and more people,

729
00:57:47,724 --> 00:57:50,137
you've gotta raise
more and more money,

730
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:54,310
and in the end you have
to do everything yourself.

731

- Did you get my message?

732
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:02,034
- You know, there's still some
things of yours at the loft.

733
00:58:02,034 --> 00:58:05,172
- I would have known
you were moving out,

734
00:58:05,172 --> 00:58:08,000
would have stayed at the loft.

735
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,758
- I could never
stand that place.

00:58:11,896 --> 00:58:14,482
When are you going
back to Paris?

737

- I have to do one
more interview.

738
00:58:19,689 --> 00:58:24,275

again because I miss you.

- Did you really make
five films in 35?

740
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:39,517
- Alright, that's it.

741
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,793
I want you out.

742
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:45,448

743

remember the name?

747

- It sounded like Factory.

748

- Factory?

749

- Alfred!

750
00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:03,034
It's Warhol.

751

- Hello?

752
00:59:08,068 --> 00:59:09,931
Yeah, that's Alfred's.

753

Yes, of course.

754

758

We have to get the studio for
tomorrow morning at seven.

759
00:59:29,068 --> 00:59:31,068
- I've been married
for 38 years.

760
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,034
I've never regretted
it one moment.

761
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:33,896
- Yeah.

762
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:39,206
- Have I ever shown you
some pictures of Alice?

763
00:59:39,206 --> 00:59:40,793
- Sure, yeah, yeah.

764
00:59:40,793 --> 00:59:42,413

brand new ones.

Here, look.

767

She looks so happy.

768
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:53,206
- After 38 years
and six children,

769
00:59:54,655 --> 00:59:58,206
Alice said to me "Love is
what you've been through

770
00:59:58,206 --> 00:59:59,931

Cinema retains for a mere
moment and is death at work.

774
01:00:10,655 --> 01:00:12,413
Television retains
nothing at all

775
01:00:12,413 --> 01:00:15,103
and is the deadly
procession that hemorrhages

all its majors.

777
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:20,448

778
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:22,275
- No answer.

779
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:25,206
- He was supposed to
be here an hour ago.

780
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:27,379
- Maybe he's just leaving.

781

down those floods?

782
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:52,275

down those floods?

off the scoots, please?

I thought you sent them down.

791

- Ready for take one!

792
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,655
- Who are you?

793
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:19,931
- I'm Andy's assistant.

794
01:02:19,931 --> 01:02:22,241
- That's fine, but where's Andy?

795
01:02:22,241 --> 01:02:24,172
- Well, Andy was really busy

796
01:02:24,172 --> 01:02:26,137
so he thought it
would be a good idea

797
01:02:26,137 --> 01:02:29,482
for me to come down
and play in my goggles.

798
01:02:29,482 --> 01:02:30,965
- They're very nice.

799

I like the goggles,
I like the belts.

802

Maybe we can feature you
on one of our next shows.

803
01:02:37,448 --> 01:02:38,655
- Oh, oh, good.

804
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:40,068
Well, maybe I should come back.

805
01:02:40,068 --> 01:02:41,655
- Come back, I really
like the goggles.

806
01:02:41,655 --> 01:02:43,620
- Come back probably tomorrow.

807

you could get some music

809
01:02:46,862 --> 01:02:48,034
somehow I can play?

810
01:02:48,034 --> 01:02:49,103
- [Man] Yeah.

811
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,862
- Who was he?

812
01:02:55,862 --> 01:02:57,931
- Andy Warhol's assistant.

813
01:02:57,931 --> 01:03:00,172
- Warhol's assistant?

814
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:02,206
And why was he playing violin?

815
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:03,448
- I don't know.

816
01:03:08,689 --> 01:03:12,068
- Lizzy, do you have
the keys to the car?

817
01:03:13,862 --> 01:03:17,620
- They're in the pocket
of my leather jacket.

818
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:23,827
- Bye, Lizzy.

819
01:03:26,862 --> 01:03:28,862

But you're sure he's on his way?

822
01:03:39,551 --> 01:03:40,379
Okay.

823

They just told me he's coming.

824

a serious person.

He wouldn't screw us.

826

wasn't his assistant.

827

Someone has to go down
there and talk to him.

833

better English than I do.

the American co-producer.

you seen my script?

for being our guest.

come to the control room?

What's he doing?

849
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:15,379
- Nothing.

850
01:06:17,689 --> 01:06:19,172

what you think

851
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:21,448
about sentence of [mumbles]

852
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:25,793
who says that cinema is a
place for crime and magic.

853
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,172
- Well, I still don't
understand what the crime part,

854
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:37,310
the question, but I always
think about the magic part

855
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:42,000
of the question is when it
really shows magic, you know.

856
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,551
And especially with people,

857
01:06:47,551 --> 01:06:51,000
some people have that magic
that when a camera goes on you

858
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,310
that there's an extra energy
or something, you know,

859
01:06:56,724 --> 01:06:59,206
for some people, it's,
you know, beautiful people

860
01:06:59,206 --> 01:07:01,551
and it makes such a difference

861
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:05,068
when they can get that
extra magic on the screen.

862
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:07,655
I don't understand
it but it happens.

863
01:07:07,655 --> 01:07:10,241
Can I take a photograph of you?

864
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:11,586

a friend I can work with.
