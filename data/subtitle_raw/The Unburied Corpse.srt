{\an8}<i>And we continue listening to good music,
and almost reaching the end of our program</i>

2
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:17,167
<i>we have Dr. Maximiliano
Espósito with us</i>

3
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,708
<i>who has just released his
new book "Tribal Education."</i>

4
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:23,458
<i>Explain to us briefly Maxi,
what the book is about?</i>

5
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:28,083
<i>Well, the book is an investigation
that took me many years.</i>

6
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:31,750
<i>I am a psychiatrist and I work
mostly with boys and teenagers</i>

7
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:34,625
<i>who have the particularity
that they grew up</i>

8
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,875
<i>or are growing up
in orphanages or reformatories.</i>

9
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,458
<i>Therefore they are not
raised in traditional families</i>

10
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:44,583
<i>and studying the subject, I found
that when they grow up in these groups</i>

11
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,708
<i>without the model
of a "normal" family.</i>

12
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,125
<i>Other codes are established,</i>

13
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,583
<i>there are other traditions,
and there are other rites</i>

14
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,667
<i>that shape their minds in another way,</i>

15
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,708
<i>as happens for example in tribes or clans.</i>

16
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:02,792
<i>The subject also comes from your own
life experience, right?</i>

17
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,250
<i>Yes,</i>

18
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>I became an orphan when I was a kid,</i>

19
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:10,833
<i>and I lived all my childhood
and adolescence in foster care.</i>

20
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,958
<i>It was a house in the countryside
where many boys lived.</i>

21
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,500
<i>Well, Maxi, thank you so much for coming,</i>

22

<i>I would have liked to talk to you.</i>

<i>I'm not calling you

30
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,250
<i>Dad died.</i>

31
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,750
<i>I don't know if you're interested
in coming,</i>

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,292
<i>I had to let you know, right?</i>

33
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,375
<i>I'm calling everyone.</i>

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,583
<i>We will have to start
with the inheritance.</i>

35
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:41,667
<i>There are the fields,
the house, it's sort of a mess.</i>

36
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,375
<i>I believe that dad left you something.</i>

37
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:50,042
<i>Well, I did my part in letting you know.
If you want, you can come.</i>

38
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,333
<i>We can have a look
at this last will issue</i>

39
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:58,625
<i>so you can say goodbye.
We are here, always. Bye.</i>

THE MORNING
DIRECTOR: JUAN MANUEL ESPOSITO

66
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,292
Hello.

67
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,000
<i>Is someone there?</i>

68
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,125
-Maxi….
-Héctor.

69
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,042
I can’t believe it, you came!

70
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,875
-How are you?
-How are you?

71
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,500
How was your trip?

72
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:56,667
It went well.

73
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,917
Maxi, how long has it been
since you last came?

74
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,625
I don’t know, like ten,
fifteen years.

75
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,375
How did you get my telephone number?

76
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:11,542
No, it has been twenty-five years
since you left.

77
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,958
Have you seen anyone else?
Have you just arrived?

78
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,167
Yes, I just arrived,
a little while ago.

79
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,250
First, I passed by the wake house,
I thought that maybe you were there.

80
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,167
Look, what happened to dad
took all of us by surprise.

81
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,833
Well, but he was very overweight.

82
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:30,958
Have you had the wake yet?

83
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,250
No, not yet.

84
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
We still have to do some paperwork.

85
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,083
But it's…. all on track.

86
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,167
We were waiting for you, Maxi.

87
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,167
The truth is that I came for a short time,
I can’t stay long.

88
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,458
But you just arrived
and you already want to go?

89
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:52,667
Not now, but I can’t stay long.

90
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,667
You were talking to me
about the inheritance,

91
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,667
with whom should I talk about this?

92
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,000
Well, you only came for that?

93
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,375
Sebastián is handling
the paperwork.

94
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,375
Why don’t we go to my office?
You can talk directly with him

95
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,542
he can explain everything
about the paperwork

96
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,208
and also about the
wake. What do you think?

97
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,708
You can estimate
there is around 4,000 head of cattle

98
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,375
and we have only twenty-five employees.

99
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,042
What was the name
of the manager?

100
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,042
-Bacigalupo.
-Bacigalupo.

101
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,833
But he died a long time ago.

102
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,958
Here, the one that took over was me.

103
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,333
The others got on with their lives.

104
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:51,958
I was the only one that
stayed on the farm with dad.

105
00:19:54,042 --> 00:19:59,667
But the farm made the money
for everyone’s studies,

106
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,542
trips,

107
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,042
rent, and parties.

108
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,875
And the others know
about the inheritance?

109
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,167
The others know it very well.

110
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,708
Dad and I put in a lot
of time and effort in this….

111
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,542
and everything works well, too….

112
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:27,250
but dad's will is
that we all talk about it.

113
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:31,625
To stay calm and discuss everything.

114
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,333
For me, the important thing
is that you came,

115
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,208
you can say goodbye to dad,

116
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,083
and we can finally finish with
everything that was left half done.

117
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:50,875
What was left half done?

118
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,042
Oh, I can’t believe this.

119
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,500
Motherfucker,
and on top of that he plays dumb.

120
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,667
How many times do I have to say to you
that you can’t do that here?

121
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,042
Go away!

122
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:04,292
Go away!

123
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:06,167
Go home!

124
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,458
Don’t even think about
coming here tomorrow!

125
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:18,750
Can you believe it?
You have to be on top of everything!

126
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:27,125
Okay, people are arriving.

127
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:43,792
What’s up?

128
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:45,917
Look who I brought.

129
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,583
<i>Maxi!</i>

130
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,458
<i>It’s so nice to see you!</i>

131
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,375
Juanma!

132
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:11,750
Hey, I saw you in the <i>La Mañana</i> newspaper,
you are the editor-in-chief!

133
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,333
You’re always so perceptive.

134
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:18,083
It’s your fault,
you always gave me everything you read.

135
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,542
You got me interested in it.

136
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,917
I started writing and fell into the vice…
the profession!

137
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:28,250
Juan, did you bring me
Benitez’s thing?

138
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:30,667
Did you bring it?

139
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,167
Yes, I left it in dad’s office.

140
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:38,042
Why don’t you leave it
on my desk, in my office?

141
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,500
Have you seen the house?

142
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,750
Yes, I’ve been looking downstairs.

143
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,958
Okay, come with me
and I’ll give you the tour upstairs.

144
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,083
Okay, let’s go.

145
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,167
Do you know? Recently,
I discovered a secret,

146
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:57,042
a Polish writer, living here in
Argentina, about one hundred years ago

147
00:22:57,208 --> 00:23:02,417
who wrote wonderful articles, and
he wrote a novel called “Nightmare”.

148
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,500
Juancito, it wouldn’t hurt to sweep here
every once in a while, right?

149
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,083
<i>It’s hard to get,
but I can send you a book.</i>

150
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:10,875
Yes, please.

151
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,708
It’s great, it’s wonderful.

152
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:41,833
There hasn’t been any light
in here for a while.

153
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,833
Dad was living alone
these last few years and let himself go.

154
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,625
Here is dad, Maxi.

155
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,500
Poor dad.

156
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,833
Poor him.

157
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,000
Why did you leave?

158
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,625
Why did you leave, dad?

159
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,542
This way Maxi, come here.

160
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,625
Over here, over here.

161
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,333
I’m sorry,
we should have told you.

162
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,417
Maxi, calm down.

163
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:50,750
Maxi, Maxi, calm down,

164
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,042
calm down.

165
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,542
This struck very hard for all of us.

166
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,500
Calm down, try to breathe.

167
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:00,708
Breathe,

168
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:02,417
breathe.

169
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,500
It’s all going to be okay,

170
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,125
calm down.

171
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:20,083
I can’t understand
why you keep Aldo like this.

172
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,125
He must be buried.

173
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,000
What you are doing,
it’s not normal.

174
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:32,667
Do you realize that?

175
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,667
It’s not the time yet.

176
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,500
Some things need to resolve.

177
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:42,583
Dad is okay with that.

178
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,250
How is he okay?

179
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,417
Hector, what are you saying?

180
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,500
What needs to be resolved?

181
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,042
What does that have
to do with being able to….

182
00:27:58,833 --> 00:27:59,833
bury him?

183
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,458
Juanma

184
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,375
are you okay
with what is happening?

185
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,292
Because it’s not okay.

186
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:18,625
Maxi look, this hurts all of us,
it’s complicated.

187
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,458
We must be organized.

188
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,833
We must do things
like dad wants.

189
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,375
He must be a part of this,

190
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,208
he has to see that we respect his will.

191
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,292
Maxi, look at me.

192
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:39,042
Be calm,

193
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:40,833
everything is going to be okay.

194
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:43,875
There’s no problem.

195
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,833
Don’t ask me to be calm.

196
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,917
It’s horrifying what you are doing.
I don’t know if you realize that.

197
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:56,625
I can’t let this continue.

198
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:01,792
Have you reported his death, at least?

199
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,708
I’m going to the police.

200
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:17,125
Wait a minute,

201
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:22,583
Wait a minute…. you’re blind.

202
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:26,375
Try to understand
our point of view.

203
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,958
You’re thinking this the wrong way.

204
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:31,833
Try to understand.

205
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,250
Hector, what do you want me to understand?

206
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,583
That you went crazy?

207
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,792
Please, let me go.

208
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,917
What do you want,
to go to the police?

209
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:48,792
Do you want to go to the police?

210
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,625
We will go with you.

211
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,500
Okay, we are already here.

212
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,583
The three of us.

213
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,208
At the door of the police station.

214
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:07,708
What?

215
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,583
I don't care about your dessert,
come here!

216
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,667
We will wait for you inside.

217
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,083
Here comes the sheriff.

218
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:37,708
You’re messing around again?

219
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,667
How are you, guys?

220
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,083
It’s been a long time
since you last visited me.

221
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:44,833
What are you
laughing about, dude?

222
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,667
We have been waiting
for you for half an hour.

223
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,042
You can come at anytime,
don’t worry….

224
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,833
I came as fast as I could,
I’m here now, right?

225
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,500
Hello. How are you,
Maximiliano Espósito?

226
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,542
Don’t you know me?

227
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:05,708
Oh, yes.

228
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,042
Oscar.

229
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,333
Hey, am I so different?

230
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,917
Look when you came back…

231
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,000
It’s been a long time.

232
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:27,375
Well….

233
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,875
We were talking….

234
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,792
I explained to him
the situation with dad.

235
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:38,958
But it seems there are doubts
about how to continue.

236
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:46,958
This is a delicate matter,

237
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:50,292
it’s going to take some time.

238
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:56,792
I can solve this as the sheriff
but the family comes first.

239
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,875
We have to do things as we do them.

240
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:05,833
You understand
what I’m saying, right?

241
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,375
No, actually, I don't understand.

242
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,500
Dad is fine where he is.

243
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:18,792
He is at his house.

244
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:22,458
He is not in danger,
nothing will happen to him there.

245
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,625
We will solve this among us
when the time is right.

246
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,333
And then we will deal with dad.

247
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:32,792
I’m sorry,

248
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,417
but I don’t think it’s okay
to leave him

249
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,333
just lying there.

250
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,792
It’s a serious situation, right?

251
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,833
The normal thing to do
is to take him to the morgue,

252
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:45,792
or a cold store….

253
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,625
We don’t have a morgue here.

254
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:00,417
We merely have something to write.

255
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,250
Look at the junk
I have as a computer.

256
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:09,250
What I mean is that maybe
there is something we can do,

257
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,083
that is what I mean.

258
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,042
Yes….

259
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,125
to wait.

260
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,917
I don’t think it will take much longer.

261
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:33,250
SECURITY POLICE

262
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:35,667
Maxi!

263
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,000
Hey, Maxi!

264
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,333
You’re tired, right?

265
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes, a little bit.

266
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:43,583
Do you want me to take you to the house?

267
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:46,958
You can rest for a while,
or if you want, you can stay the night.

268
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,417
-To the house?
-Yes.

269
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,500
No, I don’t want to go there for now.

270
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:53,083
You can come home
for as long as you want!

271
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,958
There's a guest room as well.

272
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,542
Oh, if so you can stay in mine too,
there is no problem.

273
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:03,000
Thank you, now I need to be alone
if it’s okay with you.

274
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,292
Whatever you need.

275
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,042
I’m going to walk around town.

276
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,042
Okay.

277
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,500
Maxi, in times like these

278
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,375
I need to search for spiritual guidance.

279
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:19,125
Some comfort.

280
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,250
Are you still going to church?

281
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,333
No.

282
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,458
Well, think about it.

283
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:31,208
When you are ready,
I’ll wait for you at home.

284
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,667
Okay.

285
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,542
I live next door to the Monzú’s,
do you remember?

286
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,083
The Monzú, yes.

287
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:39,375
My house has black iron gates.

288
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,792
You can come at any time,
it’s okay if you come late.

289
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,500
I’ll be up. Any time.

290
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,542
Thank you.

291
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:27,333
I’m sorry,
I didn’t mean to scare you.

292
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,625
Javier….

293
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,833
I’m a little surprised,
nothing else.

294
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:34,875
Finally!

295
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,208
Come.

296
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:47,125
So, you followed the priesthood path.

297
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,333
Well…. yes, it’s logical.

298
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,708
This was always my house
since we were kids.

299
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,667
How kind of you to come!

300
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,583
Yes, Héctor called me a few days ago.

301
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:08,417
I arrived and have been catching up
with the situation.

302
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:11,667
I don’t know if you know….

303
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:14,750
Yes, poor dad.

304
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:18,333
It took us all by surprise.

305
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,333
Oh, so you do know?

306
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,000
That he is still in the house.
Do you know that?

307
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:29,833
Sometimes things don’t go

308
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,792
as you wish, Maximiliano.

309
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,000
Death is not an easy thing.

310
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:39,292
Yes,

311
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,667
but this situation isn’t normal.

312
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:45,042
I don’t know what Héctor is thinking

313
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,542
but it’s not okay.

314
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:51,833
There is a reason to have a wake
for the dead, to bury them.

315
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,708
You must know it better than anyone,
rituals are not a whim.

316
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:03,458
And that is why I’m telling you
that death is not an easy thing.

317
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,833
Let alone in a case like a dad’s….

318
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:11,167
because dad was not an ordinary father.

319
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,333
Aldo Ventura was a patriarch.

320
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:20,042
And for a patriarch’s
favorite son like Héctor,

321
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:26,333
the grief will be a pain that
will be with him until the last day.

322
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,167
And that is something
we will need to respect.

323
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:33,583
I understand what you mean,
but I don’t agree.

324
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:41,250
At this moment, our father
is sitting in a chair, rotting.

325
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,042
Do you think that that is okay?

326
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,708
God doesn’t close a door
without opening a window.

327
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,417
You must learn from the pain.

328
00:38:57,417 --> 00:39:02,667
That you realize that you have a chance
to heal your soul’s wounds.

329
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:08,542
To heal the wounds in your heart
for leaving your father and his mission.

330
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,792
I didn’t leave anybody.

331
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:13,833
I have to apologize to you

332
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,208
because I committed
the sin of injustice.

333
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,958
You were also a favorite son.

334
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:24,667
You’re the other favorite son.

335
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,417
And, it's normal

336
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:30,208
that you couldn’t solve
the things in your past.

337
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,292
Dad….

338
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,583
was a man that worried

339
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,542
and did a lot so we could have a home,

340
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,583
so we can live abundantly.

341
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:44,792
That is why you see us like this,
close to each other, the ones that stayed.

342
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,417
And maybe, if you hadn’t left,

343
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:51,292
today, all of these situations
may have run a normal course.

344
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,417
I didn’t leave anybody.

345
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,167
Maximiliano,

346
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:04,708
dad worked harder for your
education than for any of us.

347
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,333
And when you had a chance,

348
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,292
you turned your back on the man
that gave you a home,

349
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,625
who raised you as his own.

350
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,583
You left him heartbroken.

351
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,250
You were always his favorite.

352
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,333
And one day you were gone

353
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,333
and left him a void
without even an explanation.

354
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:27,417
Anyway, he'd talked to us about you
and told us you were going to come back.

355
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,792
And you know what?
He was right because you are here.

356
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,333
What I think is that nobody

357
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,417
can decide on the future
of another person,

358
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,167
not even your father.

359
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:45,667
Dad was at your side
to guide you,

360
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:49,208
so don’t stumble,

361
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,042
don’t deviate.

362
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,625
I don’t know, maybe.

363
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,833
Maxi,

364
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,333
life, it’s not an easy thing,

365
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:06,750
but neither is death.

366
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,417
<i>Maxi?</i>

367
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,958
<i>Maxi, is that you?</i>

368
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,125
Anita….

369
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:55,875
Hi.

370
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:57,042
It’s so nice to see you!

371
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,333
Were you passing by?

372
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,292
No, no. I just came out of school.

373
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,708
I’m a teacher,
can’t you tell?

374
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:03,375
Yes, I noticed.

375
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:06,583
It’s so weird to see you here
after so long. When did you arrive?

376
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,500
Yesterday.

377
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:09,500
And why did you come back?

378
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:15,667
Because Aldo died, my dad.
A few days ago. Didn’t you know?

379
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:18,583
No, how would I know?
The Espósitos are closed.

380
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:20,750
I’m so sorry, how are you?

381
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,875
So-so.

382
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,417
The truth is that
this is something very faraway for me.

383
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,458
I came because
I need to do some paperwork.

384
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,750
You didn't visit before?

385
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:29,833
No.

386
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,542
I assumed you were in Buenos Aires,
but I never heard anything about you.

387
00:42:34,917 --> 00:42:35,875
-Okay.
-Yeah.

388
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,125
What happened to you?

389
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:41,875
Will you ever tell me?

390
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,167
It’s been so long that I don’t know

391
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,792
if I wanted to explain.

392
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,167
I don’t know what to say.

393
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:50,333
Yes, it is true, it’s been forever
since we were children.

394
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,375
I can tell that
it wasn’t so bad for you.

395
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:53,875
I can’t complain….

396
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:57,625
Do you have some time?
I would love to know about you.

397
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,792
Now? Yes, I have some time.

398
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:01,375
-Have you eaten?
-No.

399
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,958
Do you want to go to my house?
I can make you something delicious.

400
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:05,917
Okay, yes!

401
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:09,792
Come on!

402
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,625
That way?

403
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,750
-This is crazy, right?
-Yes….

404
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,375
I’m all yours!

405
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:14,292
Please, stay. Don’t leave….

406
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,500
Maxi?

407
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:35,292
Do you know that if
you come here to live,

408
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,708
you could be the hospital director?

409
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,667
You have a trajectory no one
else has, you’re better than anyone.

410
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:44,667
Do you think so?

411
00:45:49,542 --> 00:45:51,625
I have a lot of commitments
in Buenos Aires.

412
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,042
We are struggling with….

413
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,375
the college group….

414
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:03,708
Here,
you could be the secretary of health.

415
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,958
You were always so good with people.

416
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,500
You could even have your study group,
make agreements, whatever you want.

417
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,167
What can I say?
That sounds nice.

418
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,625
Come on, don’t be mean. Stay.

419
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:25,167
You can stay
at my house as long as you want.

420
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:31,208
And when you collect your inheritance,
you can spend it with me.

421
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:34,750
Are you going to miss all that? Come on.

422
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,250
<i>Hey, how is everybody?</i>

423
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:11,417
Maxi, it’s so nice to see you!

424
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,042
Dieguito! How are you?

425
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:14,208
How are you doing?

426
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:16,458
It’s so nice to see you!

427
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,583
Very nice! You look the same.

428
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,750
You look the same!

429
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,292
Oh, please, I have grey hair!

430
00:47:22,917 --> 00:47:24,333
I missed you, I mean it.

431
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,042
I don’t know the rest,
but I missed you.

432
00:47:27,542 --> 00:47:28,375
Thanks.

433
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:29,625
Dieguito,

434
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,875
why don’t you stop bugging
the associates with the raffles,

435
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,292
focus a little,

436
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,792
and put together a good team because

437
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:40,750
they are beating the crap out
of us every Saturday?

438
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,625
Diego is the President
of the Juventud Unida,

439
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,750
you must see how he maintains the club.

440
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:55,250
Oh, congratulations!

441
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:57,333
President….

442
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,333
It was a joke.

443
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,667
Dude, it was a joke.

444
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,458
What? Are you sensitive?

445
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,250
I think I’ve already told this one.

446
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:20,792
Once the old man tells me,

447
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,333
“You are going to kill a pig.”

448
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,625
He put me in the truck,

449
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,583
and took me to the pigpen
that was behind Fernandez’s post.

450
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,375
He gave me a knife,

451
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:35,417
got me into the pigpen,

452
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:38,542
and I started, of course, running
towards the pigs to kill one of them.

453
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:44,167
At some point I slipped,
I went to hell, I fell in the pigpen.

454
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,125
And the old man looks at me and says,

455
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:51,458
"If you don’t bring a dead pig
you can’t enter the house.”

456
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:54,583
Tough old man!

457
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:59,750
Do you remember when he took
us by force to Canullán’s brothel?

458
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,708
What a son of a bitch!

459
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:08,292
Yes, I remember that it was just before
I entered the police academy.

460
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:12,083
He forced me to get naked,
handcuffed me to the bed,

461
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:14,750
and called the Paraguayan girl,
do you remember the Paraguayan?

462
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:17,125
And he tells me,

463
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:18,542
“You must learn from now

464
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,292
because this is what you are going to do
everyday.”

465
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:25,417
And he didn’t leave until I was hard
and started fucking!

466
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,708
What a son of a bitch!

467
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,083
Want to play?

468
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:35,042
Thank you, I don’t play Chess anymore.

469
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,375
Come on, while the food goes down.

470
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,125
No, really,
I haven’t played in a long time,

471
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,458
I must be rusty.
Thank you, but no.

472
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,625
What are you saying,
that you forgot how the pieces move?

473
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,917
Don’t be a chicken!
It’s only for a short time.

474
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,083
Do you know how I learned to play this?

475
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,333
One afternoon in the slaughterhouse,

476
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:00,250
came a big group of Aberdeen Angus,
that are black, you know?

477
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,833
And the slaughterers,
the guys, are all dressed in white.

478
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:13,458
They sent them one by one, pim, pim, pim
and they killed them.

479
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:16,792
Then I said,

480
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,042
“At work,

481
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,250
I play Chessboard every day,

482
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,375
how can I not learn how to play?

483
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:28,917
So, I learnt.

484
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,917
But….

485
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:33,833
I always play with
the white pieces,

486
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:36,042
they are the ones
that work for me.

487
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:33,583
Check.

488
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:49,500
Check.

489
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:08,875
Check.

490
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:22,542
Check.

491
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,125
Check.

492
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:06,875
Good, Maxi, great!

493
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,917
<i>It’s yours, Maxi, finish it!</i>

494
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:56,667
Maxi!

495
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:58,750
Maxi!

496
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:01,292
Shit!

497
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,625
<i>Calm down!</i>

498
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,833
Maxi, calm down!

499
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:13,250
Hey…

500
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,625
I changed the sheets earlier today,
and there was nothing!

501
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:16,583
In the bathroom?

502
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:19,375
No, there’s nothing!
I didn’t see anything!

503
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:23,750
Wait, wait, chill.
You’re not thinking straight.

504
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:25,875
Calm down.

505
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:29,083
We were together yesterday
and you didn’t take anything.

506
00:59:29,167 --> 00:59:31,917
Think, when was the last time
you took them?

507
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,333
Yes, I know.

508
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,708
Slow down, Maxi.

509
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,667
Stop and think.

510
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:15,292
I’m here for whatever you need.

511
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:17,750
Thank you.

512
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:20,208
Thank you very much.

513
01:00:22,417 --> 01:00:24,625
I left the medication
in the room upstairs.

514
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:27,792
Do you want to go with me?

515
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:31,083
You go and do

516
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:33,125
what you have to do.

517
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:36,958
But I’ll stay as long as you need, okay?

518
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:40,583
You’ll be fine, go.

519
01:01:35,417 --> 01:01:39,625
At this point in my life,
guarding as if I were a patrol officer.

520
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,792
But for you, we do whatever is needed.

521
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:48,875
We miss you so much.

522
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,083
Who’s there?

523
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:12,250
It’s me, Maxi.

524
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,500
So, you came back.

525
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,667
I thought you left again.

526
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:22,458
Thank goodness.

527
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,375
Show your face!

528
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:28,333
Show!

529
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:30,167
What are you doing here?

530
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,792
I forgot something the other day
and came looking for it.

531
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,750
You? What are you doing here?

532
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,500
I explained this to you
at the police station.

533
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,875
Hurrying up the paperwork.

534
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,250
Are you going to take him?

535
01:02:51,792 --> 01:02:52,625
Not yet.

536
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:54,750
We’ll see.

537
01:02:55,875 --> 01:02:57,250
And when are we going to bury him?

538
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:04,167
We’re almost there, aren't we?

539
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,500
Sadistic, son of a bitch.

540
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,500
You ruined my life, you fucked all of us.
What more do you want?

541
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,583
You can’t be here anymore.

542
01:03:37,292 --> 01:03:38,708
I’ll bury you, dad.

543
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,833
What are you doing?

544
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:49,083
What’s your name?

545
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,500
Tell this man what is your name.

546
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,917
Lucía….

547
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,875
She arrived yesterday from Misiones.

548
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,333
Brand new.

549
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:02,875
And how should I know
she is brand new?

550
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:05,917
That no one touched her?

551
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,500
Easy, Tito,
it’s all checked out.

552
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,583
Tell this man how old you are.

553
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,875
Eighteen….

554
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,625
Of course, when they’re fifteen,
they’re eighteen.

555
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:27,958
And when they’re twenty-five,
they are also eighteen!

556
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,333
Hello.

557
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:37,250
Yes….

558
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:39,583
Is everything ready?

559
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:42,208
Is it all arranged?

560
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,708
Okay. I’ll be there shortly.

561
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:47,750
Let's go.

562
01:05:04,042 --> 01:05:04,875
Hey.

563
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,250
Hey!

564
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:14,042
Hey!

565
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:18,625
Wake up.

566
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,167
Maxi.

567
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,917
Hey, Maxi.

568
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:09,000
Today is the day.

569
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:17,542
Not everybody is here,
but we’re enough.

570
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:21,750
Today we define inheritance.

571
01:06:25,292 --> 01:06:26,125
Dad….

572
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:35,708
Dad must decide
who will continue all of this.

573
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:52,792
Do you remember now?

574
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,125
Do you remember now,
Maxi, what we used to do here?

575
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:02,750
Maxi, it’s this and then
we are almost done.

576
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:05,375
Today it will be defined.

577
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,583
We’re all grown up….

578
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,708
Someday it was going to be our turn,
right?

579
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:20,542
This is a family issue,
and we need to solve it among ourselves.

580
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,000
There are a lot of ways to do it,

581
01:08:25,417 --> 01:08:28,042
but it has to be done between you and me.

582
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:31,625
And if you don’t want to,

583
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:37,707
I and the guys
will agree to make a clean break.

584
01:08:39,417 --> 01:08:40,625
And we will feel sorry for dad.

585
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:42,957
Héctor, you’re crazy!

586
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:49,832
We’re all crazy.

587
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:57,042
So, let’s finish this.

588
01:08:57,582 --> 01:08:59,167
Yes or no?

589
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,042
Dad, we’re almost ready.

590
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:55,375
My sons!

591
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:59,583
This moon is tying the fate that

592
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,833
walked far for so many years.

593
01:13:03,042 --> 01:13:05,708
You will feel the whip
on the back to stop,

594
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:07,375
and choose the path to take.

595
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:10,917
My little orphans,

596
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:13,458
I went back in time,

597
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:17,708
to flay the ox
and the seedless bull!

598
01:13:18,208 --> 01:13:22,583
To hold you in the comfort of my love….

599
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:36,458
Dad, it’s so nice that you are here.

600
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:57,875
No, dad, I’m Héctor.

601
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:00,292
Dad, I’m your favorite.

602
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:03,458
I fulfilled everything.

603
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:05,958
Maxi is the traitor!

604
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,833
Maxi left you.

605
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:12,708
I’m your Tito, dad!

606
01:14:14,292 --> 01:14:16,167
I’m your beloved Tito.

607
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:31,083
As you wish, dad.

608
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:38,292
You decided.

609
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:44,500
Thanks for choosing me.

610
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:48,750
It’s so nice to be with you.

611
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,583
I love you so much.

612
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:47,958
The wild horse doesn't get tamed,
the savage one doesn't get settled

613
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:51,625
<i>the ring is not taken
if the horse bucks.</i>

614
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:56,625
<i>After the first there is no prize,
there is only slaughter!</i>

615
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,333
<i>The blood is drunk
and it gives power.</i>

616
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:05,042
<i>The lineage is absorbed
and never gets lost.</i>

617
01:16:06,667 --> 01:16:09,958
<i>My boys, my orphans.</i>

618
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,208
<i>Long live the Espósitos!</i>

619
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:19,292
<i>Long live the Espósitos!</i>

620
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,500
<i>Okay, thank you very much, guys.</i>

621
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:50,542
It’s beautiful.

622
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:53,083
It seems like another house.

623
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:54,292
Yes.

624
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,125
<i>Okay, kids, we’re here!</i>

625
01:19:12,542 --> 01:19:14,542
<i>Come on, come on, it’s this way.</i>

626
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:20,375
{\an8}<i>Now we’re going to see the house
and going to say hi to Maximiliano,</i>

627
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:22,167
{\an8}<i>he will take care of you.</i>

628
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,625
{\an8}<i>He is my brother, so from
now on, I’ll be your uncle.</i>

629
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:31,083
<i>Hey, you’re here!
Welcome, what a joy!</i>

630
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,083
<i>You’re going to have a lot of fun here,
and there is room for everybody.</i>

631
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,833
<i>Tomás! Come here, Tomás, my love.</i>

632
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:40,333
<i>Don't separate yourself
from the rest because you may get lost.</i>

633
01:19:40,917 --> 01:19:43,667
The house is very big,
and we’re going to see all of it.
