many recent years
of deep darkness,

8
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,795
watching the spread of
the poison of Hitlerism

9
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,931
and Fascism in Europe,

10
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:33,701
and the growth of imperialism
and militarism in Japan,

11
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:37,572
and the final clash of
war all over the world.

12
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,808
Then came the dark days
of the fall of France,

13
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:42,877
and the ruthless
bombing of England,

14
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,178
and the desperate
battle of the Atlantic,

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,848

Americans have radios,
automobiles, big beef steaks.

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,159
When a people have those things,
they don't want to fight.

to war reports?

32
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,831
- [Reporter] Americans
won't sleep in hammocks

33

- Did the radio say the
Germans might attack us?

35
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:43,905

a tiger selling his wool

00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,384
Pretty chilly this morning.

52

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,952
Anything else?
- [Lodell] That is all.

187
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,222
- Hello, Lieutenant Grant.

188
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:37,424
- Ms. Schuler.

189
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,695
- [Lodell] That is all, Linda.

190
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,867
- Good girl.

191
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,435
- How's the wife, Lieutenant?

192
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:50,804
- Good. Good.

193
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:52,206
Very good, sir.

194
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,675
- Good, good.

195
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,611
So is was that fence repair
near tower six coming?

196
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,112
- Already done, sir.

197
00:12:58,145 --> 00:12:59,446
- And that sewage?

198
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,382
- Completed as of yesterday.

199
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,318
And all these men, they,
they work exceptionally well,

200
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,886
I must say.

201
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,422
- Maybe the mess hall could
use a second coat of paint.

202
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:12,326
- We took care of that
about two weeks ago, sir.

203
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,095
Do you think it needs another?

204
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,599
- Lieutenant, what I need
is a new list of duties

205
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:19,567
to keep these men occupied.

206
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,302
Honest work, Lieutenant.

207
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,872
That's what keeps their minds
off troublemaking and escape.

208
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,141
Do you know why most of
the Civil War soldiers

209
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,109
tried to escape?

210
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,811
- [Grant] Can't say that I do.

211
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:33,314
- To reunite with
their loved ones.

212
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,317
So until these men are
reunited with their loved ones,

213
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,852
it's our job to
maintain the peace.

214
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,054
- Yes, peace.

215
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,223
Sir, speaking about peace,

216
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,527
the Red Cross has
sent another shipment

217
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,960
of goodwill art supplies.

218
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,330
- Good.

219
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,099
See that they're
dispersed accordingly.

220
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,536
But give that Eduard
fellow first look.

221
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,740
Have you seen what
he's been working on?

222
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,007
- I have.

223
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,710
I caught a glimpse
of it the other day.

224
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:03,977
Gotta say, it's, it's
quite impressive.

225
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,846
Beautiful works of art.

226
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,781
- Good.

227
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:08,882
Dismissed.

228
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,721
(drums beating)

229
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:19,326
(phone ringing)

230
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,232
(car engine rumbling)

231
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:34,408
(ominous music)

232
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,813
(gunshots banging)

233
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,749
- [Donny] Grandma!

234
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:42,082
- [Rudy] Donny!

235
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,119
(suspenseful music)

236
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,688
- [Checkpoint Soldier]
All right, keep it moving.

237
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:48,188
Just follow them.

238
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,635
- Sure is a lot of them.

239
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,780
(fist knocking)

240
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,652
- Hey, good morning, Clara.

241
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:18,887
- [Clara] Carl.

242
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,789
- I hope you don't
mind me stopping in.

243
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,726
- Why don't you come inside?

244
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,932
I was just warming some milk.

245
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:33,802
Can I get you anything?

246
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:34,636
- Oh, not for now.

247
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,136
Thank you.

248
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,373
Where's that little
blessing baby Jean at?

249
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,542
- Should be up soon.

250
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,381
Uh, I wasn't expecting
to see you today.

251
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,684
- No, I wanted to
see you, Clara.

252
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,953
You're special to me.

253
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,892
We missed you at our gatherings.

254
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:58,827
Again.

255
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,930
- Been busy helping
Rudy make ends meet.

256
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,568
- You know, Clara, I can
make things easier for you.

257
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:10,170
That man of yours is broken.

258
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,073
A father with a
bad back is like a,

259
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,142
a singer without a voice.

260
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,511
- You should leave.

261
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:18,546
I'll see you at
service, I promise.

262
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,148
(Carl scoffs)

263
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:32,326
- You know, Clara,
you and the boys,

264
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,530
you could have it better.

265
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:38,733
- Please go.

266
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:46,240
(door rattling)

267
00:16:47,942 --> 00:16:50,177
- Get your man over
here and fix this door.

268
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,182
(door slamming)

269
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:59,821
(car engine rumbling)

270
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,600
(Donny sighs)

271
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:15,737
- You think them
Germans are dangerous?

272
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,671
- Can't say.

273
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:18,973
- You're right.

274
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:21,876
Can't say, can we?

275
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:25,980
- [Tom] You shouldn't
have them Nazi brats

276
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:27,481
around here nohow.

277
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,717
- Well, let's not be spouting
off with all that hate talk.

278
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,019
Now, Tom, them boys over there,

279
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,152
they're not any
different from our boys.

280
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,688
And in the same situation and-

281
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:36,991
- Frank, you've got a grandson
fighting in the Navy, right?

282
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:39,426
You're gonna be singing that
same tune when a Jap sub

283
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,596
sends your grandson to
the bottom of the ocean?

284
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,997
- Tom Barrett, you're
coming darn close

285
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:44,464
to crossing a line with me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

286
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,034
whoa, whoa, whoa.

287
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,535
Let's calm down now.

288
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,605
- I fought the Germans in
the first war, remember?

289
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:53,340
And I still don't think we
need to blame all Germans

290
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,375
for the actions of some.

291
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,779
- Many folks in our community
come from German stock.

292
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:58,713
- That's right.

293
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:01,049
- And good stock it is too.

294
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,917
- Well, maybe some of
your fine German folk

295
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,451
may have treasonous thoughts.

296
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,153
Do you ever think about that?
- Oh, come on, Tom, you don't-

297
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,088
- Not what we're saying is it?

298
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,958
- Why don't you go ask some
of our Jewish neighbors

299
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,492
how they feel about those
Nazi death camp reports.

300
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:14,127
- Algona has been called upon.

301
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,064
It's our duty as Americans
to look over the-

302
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,197
- Shut up, Clip.

303
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:20,668
If all you wanna roll over
and let these Nazi bastards

304
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:21,903
live here among us,

305
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:24,104
well you watch what
happens the first time

306
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,907
something happens
to our families.

307
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,545
(light dramatic music)

308
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,015
- Warm-ups?

309
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:34,949
- Oh, definitely.

310
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,718
- Yeah, I think that'd be good.

311
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,920
- Helen, I'll take one.

312
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,487
- Make that two, please.

313
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,961
- What do you say, William?

314
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,261
- [William] I don't say.

315
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,699
- You must have some say
on the matter, don't ya?

316
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:54,201
- [William] You don't want
to hear what I have to say

317
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,503
on such matters.

318
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,042
- Well, do you think how
these PWs here in town

319
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,442
is a good idea?

320
00:19:06,714 --> 00:19:09,449
(William sighs)

321
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:15,089
- I enjoy my peace and
quiet here in the morning.

322
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:19,393
Time to read my paper, I
have my coffee and biscuits,

323
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:24,498
but this morning is turning
into quite an awful ruckus.

324
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,902
- Yeah, I do apologize
for all of that, William.

325
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:30,838
But you, this is
your hometown too.

326
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,440
You must have some thoughts.

327
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:37,879
- You must know about enslaved
people and such, right?

328
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,915
- I was born in the north.

329
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,752
I'm not an expert
on nigger affairs,

330
00:19:44,786 --> 00:19:47,689
which disqualifies me from
being any sort of expert

331
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,557
on Nazi affairs.

332
00:19:50,591 --> 00:19:53,226
- But you do have a say, right?

333
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,832
(William sighs)

334
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:02,804
- If I give y'all my say, will
you leave me alone in peace?

335
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,375
I know that fear can
create hateful feelings.

336
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:14,347
It's easier to be
angry than to own fear.

337
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,119
But them boys in that camp,

338
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,924
they're just like your
sons and your grandsons.

339
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:24,859
They're just doing
what they're told.

340
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,063
And I'd be willing to wager
you that them boys are more

341
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:31,331
afraid of us than
we are of them.

342
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,737
Now, I sell products at
that camp all the time,

343
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,607
and I see no reason
to hate anybody.

344
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:44,612
This war will be over soon,

345
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,814
and them boys are
gonna go back home.

346
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:50,651
Home to whatever's left
and whoever's left alive.

347
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:52,452
I wouldn't lose
no sleep over it.

348
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,228
Okay, so why don't you
gentlemen go about your business

349
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,462
and leave this old
negro to his coffee

350
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,264
and his newspaper in peace.

351
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,433
Hm?

352
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:13,841
(William sighs)

353
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,144
- You know where coffee
beans come from, little man?

354
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:17,612
- No, where?

355
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:18,880
- Not from Iowa.

356
00:21:20,214 --> 00:21:23,217
- I just brewed a fresh pot.

357
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:24,852
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

358
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:27,989
You want anything to eat?

359
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:29,289
- Just the usual please.

360
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:38,331
Hey, I need to go have
a word with William.

361
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,399
Okay?
- Okay.

362
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:49,076
- William, may I speak with you?

363
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:53,346
- Oh, what can I do for
you, young Mr. Tietz?

364
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:58,052
- You were saying that you
sell goods to the camp?

365
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,587
- You heard right.

366
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,289
They get most of their goods
from corporate accounts,

367
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,025
but they do buy
some things local.

368
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:07,128
- Well, I might
have some surplus

369
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,496
that I could sure stand to move.

370
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,966
- Well, they buy
milk, eggs, pies.

371
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,635
Most anything you
can get in there.

372
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:17,238
They see it as good relations.

373
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,341
- You wouldn't mind
if I moved a few items

374
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,276
over there would you?

375
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,878
- Oh, absolutely I'll do that.

376
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,180
And you can go with
me on the next trip.

377
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:27,380
I'll make some introductions.

378
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,116
- I'd really appreciate that.

379
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,885
And I'm more than
happy to drive.

380
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:32,887
Hey, Helen.

381
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:34,956
His breakfast is on me.

382
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:37,892
Thank you.

383
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,993
- Mr. Tietz.

384
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:52,306
(drums beating)

385
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,274
- [Lewis] Hate paperwork.

386
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:54,809
I'm always doing paperwork.

387
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,010
Every day I'm doing paperwork.

388
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,246
- Ah, Sergeant Lewis.
- Hey.

389
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,515
- The men who were working
lumber further north

390
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:04,051
claims they saw,
how you say this?

391
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:06,621
Indians in the forest.

392
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:09,056
- [Lewis] Indian head penny.

393
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,625
- They were afraid
of getting their hair

394
00:23:10,658 --> 00:23:12,994
and the skin removed
with a knife.

395
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,962
- What, scalped?
- Huh?

396
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:17,064
- Indians, nah, not likely.

397
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,835
So you found those coins
in the back of the truck?

398
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,336
- Yes.

399
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:26,807
- Well, hey, lemme trade you
up for some, some coupons.

400
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,776
Prisoners aren't allowed
to have currency.

401
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:29,911
- Ah.
- So I'm gonna give you

402
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:31,411
some of these.

403
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,014
Thanks.
- Ah.

404
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:36,684
I will use it to
try this hair piece

405
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:39,987
you speak so highly of.
- No, nein, no.

406
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:41,022
Hershey's.
- Oh.

407
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:43,090
- It's a chocolate bar.

408
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:44,225
- Ah.
- You're gonna love 'em.

409
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,860
Little piece of heaven.

410
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,295
Hair piece, whole
different thing.

411
00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,030
You don't want that.

412
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,932
- I could use a little heaven.

413
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:51,832
Yeah.

414
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,168
- Hey, hey.

415
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,570
So I heard you krauts was
working on some sort of project.

416
00:23:58,005 --> 00:24:00,608
- Yeah, we've been working
hard on it in our spare time.

417
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,475
- Spare time.

418
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,913
Hey, this time of year,
Christmas, I miss my girl.

419
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:06,847
- Mm.

420
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:08,049
- She's back in Brooklyn.

421
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:09,850
That's New York City.
- Hm.

422
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:12,119
- I get real excited
about Christmas.

423
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:13,754
She doesn't care
that much about it,

424
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,488
on account of her
being Jewish and all.

425
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:17,258
They don't really
believe in that,

426
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,027
well the same things
that, that all of us...

427
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:22,596
Yeah. Yeah.

428
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,899
But I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to bring that up.

429
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:26,600
- It's okay, I-

430
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:28,436
- I know not all
Germans are, you know-

431
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,705
- You don't have to
explain yourself.

432
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:31,639
- Okay.

433
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:34,408
Okay, yeah.

434
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,711
- Yeah.

435
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:40,114
- See you, Eddie.

436
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:41,048
See you.

437
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,585
- Bye, Helen.
- Take care.

438
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,155
- Miss Fitzgerald is real
nice, don't you think?

439
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:51,359
- I think we've had
enough coffee for the day.

440
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:55,162
(rag rubbing)

441
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,936
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

442
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:04,705
(door slamming)

443
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:15,850
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

444
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:22,957
(speaking foreign
language continues)

445
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,794
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

446
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:27,728
(prisoners of war chuckling)

447
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:31,799
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

448
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:39,006
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

449
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,250
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

450
00:25:49,283 --> 00:25:53,522
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

451
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:01,530
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

452
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:05,800
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

453
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:13,974
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

454
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:18,245
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

455
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,320
(suspenseful music)

456
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:38,199
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

457
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:42,470
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

458
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:50,444
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

459
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:55,149
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

460
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:57,284
- Hey, hey, fellas.

461
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:58,319
Everything okay?
- [Alios] Yes.

462
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,020
Everything is fine, thank you.

463
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,290
- [Alan] What's going on?
(Jorg panting)

464
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:06,427
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

465
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,563
- You shall have
no Gods before me.

466
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:15,136
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

467
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:22,376
(paper rustling)

468
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:30,451
(Jorg speaking foreign language)

469
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,794
- Go with peace, my friend.

470
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:46,834
- I can fix that.

471
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:51,138
My father was a
librarian in town.

472
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,406
He repaired many books.

473
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:56,010
I helped him when
I was a young boy.

474
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,411
- I would appreciate that.

475
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,514
Thank you.
- Yeah.

476
00:28:02,383 --> 00:28:03,851
- What set that off?

477
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:06,754
(Eduard sighs)

478
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,591
- We all love our country
in, in very different ways

479
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:13,460
and it's harder for
some to face the facts.

480
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,564
- Yeah, I know.

481
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,535
I also know that you've been
volunteering for night shifts

482
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,572
at the Hormel Cannery.
- Yeah.

483
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:28,677
I was hoping the extra pay and
more time would help me work

484
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:31,946
on the project during the day.

485
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,649
- That's actually why I
came to speak with you.

486
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:36,116
Might have some good news.

487
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:39,286
Colonel Lodell is thinking
about having you and your men

488
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,423
go full-time on the project.

489
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:43,958
- Oh.
- [Alan] With pay.

490
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,629
- With pay?
- With a little pay.

491
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,698
Possibly as soon as next week.

492
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,398
Okay, he's also thinking
about assigning you

493
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,801
an empty warehouse
to use as a studio.

494
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:55,269
- Wunderbar.

495
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:57,505
This would help our
time schedule greatly.

496
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,906
- Well, it's truly wunderbar

497
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,908
what you and your men are doing.

498
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:03,077
- We might be able to finish
the new one by Christmas

499
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,278
with a little faith.

500
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,280
- Amen.
- Amen.

501
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:09,883
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

502
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,120
(Eduard chuckling)

503
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,188
- Hi, Mr. Tietz.

504
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,122
Hi, Donny.

505
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,126
- Good to see you and
your mother getting
by with the store.

506
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:24,431
- Hi.

507
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,068
- I was thinking about
working at the PW camp

508
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:29,604
as a clerk in the canteen.

509
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:32,806
But you know who
won't let me go.

510
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,643
Yeah, she works there.

511
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:36,544
- Yeah, your mother's just
trying to look out for you.

512
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:37,878
That's all.

513
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,147
- Mm hm.

514
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,815
Well, you have that right.

515
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,685
And I'll have to keep
looking out for my daughter

516
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:46,387
until she starts
making better choices.

517
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,921
- Hello, Mrs. Heckler.

518
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,391
You look great in your uniform.

519
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:52,761
- Miss.

520
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,228
Or, or is, is it?

521
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:55,229
- No, it's okay.

522
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,533
You know, since
Howard was killed,

523
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:02,002
I'm not really sure what
to call myself either.

524
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,975
Did you ever get around
to trying that ointment

525
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,511
for your back spasms?

526
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:10,344
- Oh, no, no.

527
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:11,278
Not yet.

528
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,914
How is the second
job at the camp?

529
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,116
- It, it's okay.

530
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,653
Just doing my part to help.

531
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:20,921
- I was just telling
Mr. Tietz here

532
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:23,023
about how you won't
let me work there.

533
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:24,659
It's not fair.

534
00:30:24,693 --> 00:30:26,894
- Fair has nothing
to do with it.

535
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:29,764
- Afraid them German soldiers
might try and kill us all?

536
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:32,232
(hand tapping)
- Oh, no.

537
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:35,135
It isn't the killing I'm worried
about with those soldiers.

538
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:38,640
And the danger can be found
on both sides of the fence

539
00:30:38,673 --> 00:30:40,040
for a girl her age.

540
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:41,875
- Mother, I'm 17.

541
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,110
- [Donny] What are
you worried about?

542
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,378
- Enough, Donny.
- [Donny] What?

543
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:45,680
- Hush.

544
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:46,914
- Okay, that's enough.

545
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:48,550
I don't wanna hear
another word about it.

546
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,617
I need your help with the store.

547
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:51,952
Understood?
- Yes.

548
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:52,787
- Good.

549
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:55,557
Okay, I need to get going.

550
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,157
Let's catch up soon over coffee.

551
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,226
And oh please tell
Clara hello for me.

552
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,327
- I would like that.

553
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,295
And I will.

554
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:08,969
- Anything else?

555
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,437
- One chocolate bar, please.

556
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:11,872
- [Sally] Hm, of course.

557
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:15,309
- [Donny] Thank you.

558
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:16,910
- Take care.
- Bye.

559
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:18,912
Come back soon.

560
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:21,750
Bye, Donny.

561
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:22,684
- [Donny] Bye.

562
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,125
- Hello, Chaplain Fluke.

563
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,926
- Eduard.
- Hi.

564
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,462
- Two pickles please.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

565
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,534
- Three.
(Eduard chuckling)

566
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:40,467
Thank you.

567
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:43,505
- We need more supplies.

568
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:46,608
Some of the materials
have been weeks incoming.

569
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:47,642
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

570
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:49,276
- There is a war on.

571
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:51,245
Some of the supplies
are hard to come by.

572
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:54,148
What do you need?

573
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:00,154
- We need more plaster,
fire, paint, it's...

574
00:32:01,455 --> 00:32:02,524
- Okay.
- Yeah.

575
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:04,191
- I'll, I'll see what I can do.

576
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,231
- Yeah, it's, this war has
really ruined the spirit of

577
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,067
connection between us all.
- Yeah.

578
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,537
That's why it's good you're
doing what you're doing.

579
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,839
It brings people together.
- Yeah.

580
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:24,211
We need more wisdom in the
choosing of our leaders.

581
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,814
- Ah, careful.

582
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,181
That kind of talk could
get you in trouble

583
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,016
with some of your own.

584
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,019
Assuming you're talking
about your leaders.

585
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:36,223
- Oh, ours today,
perhaps yours tomorrow.

586
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,794
- Hey, if I do get
you the supplies.

587
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:41,228
- Hm.

588
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:43,197
- What do you think of
this chiseled profile, huh?

589
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,866
One of the wise men.

590
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:46,333
- Oh.

591
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:50,437
Ah, perhaps I make an
ugly camel after you huh?

592
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:52,406
- Get outta here.

593
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,675
I'll see what I can do.

594
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,043
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

595
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:56,911
- That's amazing.

596
00:32:56,945 --> 00:32:58,646
You're doing so well.

597
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:06,086
Okay, I'm just gonna
get in a few here.

598
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,555
Oh, ease back.

599
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:09,389
Lower you back.

600
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:12,125
You're doing really great.

601
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,628
Oh, very good.

602
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:18,298
Okay, I'm just gonna take
off your boots now okay?

603
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:21,936
One moment and I'll
help you lean back.

604
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,571
Okay, here we go. Ready?

605
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:26,240
(gentle music)

606
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,819
(injured soldier speaking
foreign language)

607
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,086
We're gonna help you.

608
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,220
It's okay.

609
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:43,725
(gentle music continues)

610
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,934
(crops rustling)

611
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:12,319
(corn husk cracking)

612
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:21,763
(light music)

613
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:27,267
(Rudy groaning)

614
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:28,937
- You okay?

615
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,871
Dad?

616
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,677
- Pray with me, kid.

617
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:44,953
In our time of need, give us
answers and give us strength.

618
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:48,623
(Rudy sighs)

619
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,225
(Rudy groans)

620
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,661
I'm gonna have to find
some help for the harvest.

621
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:54,729
We're late already.

622
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:59,634
(Rudy sighs)

623
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,269
This war's left most of
the farms short on hands.

624
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:11,579
Those Germans we saw today.

625
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,581
- Nazi bastards.

626
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,250
- I don't wanna ever
hear that kind of talk

627
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,219
out of you ever again.

628
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:22,389
- But, Mr. Barrett and
even Uncle Sam were saying-

629
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,391
- Have you ever
talked to any of them?

630
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,127
- No sir.

631
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,897
- Then don't go making talk
based on what others say.

632
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:36,004
Look, in a small town like this,

633
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:38,271
someone's always
gonna have an opinion.

634
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,109
The best opinions
are the ones you make

635
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,210
based on your own experiences.

636
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,581
- Yes, sir.

637
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:53,921
- I love you, kid.

638
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:59,159
Let's get on back
up to the house.

639
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:00,662
Momma's got food fixed.

640
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:04,032
(soft music)

641
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:14,942
(soft music continues)

642
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:28,556
- Welcome, sir.

643
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:31,358
We do not get American
soldiers here very often.

644
00:36:34,662 --> 00:36:38,900
- Why we allow this
rubbish, beyond me.

645
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:41,035
- [Clerk] This is just news.

646
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:43,403
- Well, it looks to me
like Nazi propaganda.

647
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:56,150
(cigarette pack tapping)

648
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:02,456
- Do you plan to compensate
for those cigarettes, sir?

649
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:06,828
We try to keep very exact books.

650
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:08,596
- I bet you do.

651
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:11,599
Bet you do.

652
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:19,640
(Alfons speaking
foreign language)

653
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:33,921
- How's your day been?

654
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:35,890
- Long.

655
00:37:37,225 --> 00:37:39,326
Just finally got
Gene down for a nap.

656
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:45,099
- Crops need to be harvested
and we can't wait much longer.

657
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,835
- Yeah.

658
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,138
Not sure how we're gonna
manage with your back and all.

659
00:37:50,171 --> 00:37:52,472
Can't ask my daddy
for any more handouts.

660
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:55,810
- I didn't ask for any
handouts the first time.

661
00:37:57,078 --> 00:37:58,713
- We needed it, Rudy.

662
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,649
- I've been thinking
about selling some surplus

663
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:02,817
at the prison camp.

664
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:06,053
- Lord knows we
could use the money.

665
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,456
This house is about ready
to fall down around us.

666
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:12,093
Winter will be here soon.

667
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:14,729
And the house does
little to keep warmth.

668
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:16,230
- I'll get the
house more insulated

669
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:17,999
after we bring in the harvest.

670
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:21,836
Which reminds me,

671
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:25,239
I plan on talking with
someone about using them

672
00:38:25,273 --> 00:38:27,175
German soldiers as field hands.

673
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:32,680
- What?

674
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:33,881
- Hm?

675
00:38:33,915 --> 00:38:35,283
I heard that the Hormel Cannery

676
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,785
and certain local
companies have used them.

677
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,587
"Hard workers," they say,

678
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,789
and they actually pay
the Germans to work.

679
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:46,594
- Those prisoners
here on our farm?

680
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:48,361
- Clara, they send guards.

681
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,099
Look, we need help.

682
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,366
I need help.

683
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,003
The normal hands we hire
are off fighting a war.

684
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:01,309
- Do you think
that's responsible?

685
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,744
- Responsible is
paying our bills.

686
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:04,645
Clara.

687
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:07,447
Clara!

688
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:11,752
(silverware clanging)

689
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:14,555
- Are you really thinking
about having the Germans

690
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:15,656
here on the farm?

691
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,359
- Eat.

692
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:25,266
(Rudy sighs)

693
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:28,536

(nail clinking)

736
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:50,164
- [Rudy] All right,
let's move it.

737
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:51,098
- [Donny] This is heavy.

738
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:52,399
Why can't you do it on your own?

739
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:56,704
- Hey, without
discipline, we're nothing.

740
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,439
All right?
- [Donny] Yes, sir.

741
00:43:58,472 --> 00:43:59,874
- One, two, three, go.

742
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,476
(Rudy groaning)

743
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,382
Come on.

744
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:16,223
- [Donny] Mayor Hewitt's here.

745
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:17,858
- All right, kid, finish up.

746
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:18,893
- [Donny] Yes, sir.

747
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:21,695
- Afternoon, Rudy.

748
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:22,631
- Frank.

749
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:26,300
- I got your message.

750
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,701
It seemed important.

751
00:44:27,735 --> 00:44:29,036
- Well, it is.

752
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:29,870
It is.

753
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:30,804
I've...

754
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:33,575
Well, I've been thinking
about the harvest

755
00:44:33,608 --> 00:44:35,209
and the shortage of farm hands.

756
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:36,677
- Yeah.

757
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,813
- And many of our neighbors
have been facing the same issue.

758
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,149
- Yeah, I'm aware of
the labor shortage.

759
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:43,350
And you with your bad back,

760
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:45,219
I'm sure that doesn't
help matters any.

761
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:50,124
- You know that
Pioneer and Hormel

762
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:51,692
have been using those Germans.

763
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,428
- What are you getting at?

764
00:44:55,763 --> 00:44:58,499
- Well, I was thinking
maybe them boys would work

765
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,800
all right in the fields.

766
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:10,010
- We've been having quite a
ruckus just having them in town.

767
00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:12,913
Working on a family farm?

768
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:14,248
I don't know about that.

769
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:16,450
- Come on, Frank.

770
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:18,185
What choice do some of us have?

771
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:20,522
Huh?

772
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:23,324
I mean, we're gonna let the
crops spoil in the fields

773
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:25,993
because we're too
proud to ask for help?

774
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:31,098
- So, you know this idea is
gonna create some resistance.

775
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,434
- Resistance?

776
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,606
You should have heard me drop
this idea at the supper table

777
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:40,241
with Clara.
(Frank chuckling)

778
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:42,209
Resistance.
- I bet.

779
00:45:45,379 --> 00:45:48,650
So you think them German boys
would behaved themselves?

780
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:50,719
- If it was me cooped
up inside that compound,

781
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:53,821
I think I might take to working
in the outdoors just fine.

782
00:45:55,624 --> 00:45:57,424
- And you'd be
willing to go first?

783
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:00,294
- Well, someone has to.

784
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:08,769
- This could blow up in my face

785
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:10,804
if something went
wrong, you know?

786
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:16,745
- Or you could be the
politician who solved

787
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:18,513
the labor shortage in the area.

788
00:46:22,216 --> 00:46:24,051
- Now, I do like
the sound of that.

789
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,621
I'll tell you what,

790
00:46:27,656 --> 00:46:29,256
let me mull this
over in my mind a bit

791
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,792
and see what we
can come up with.

792
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:32,727
All right?

793
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:34,962
- Fair enough.

794
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,667
- Hey, Donny.
- Hi.

795
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,768
- Mind your pop now.

796
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:45,472
- Dad.

797
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:48,876
- Hey, I need you to trust me.

798
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:50,911
Okay?

799
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:53,213
Now, please finish your chores.

800
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:54,148
- Yes, sir.

801
00:46:57,351 --> 00:47:00,020
(hay rustling)

802
00:47:07,696 --> 00:47:10,264
(Clara sighs)

803
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:24,813
(picture frame clinking)

804
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:40,961
(saw whirring)
(hammer pounding)

805
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:51,238
(Alios speaking
foreign language)

806
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:52,574
- Welcome, Captain.

807
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:03,150
- Quite the operation
you have here.

808
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:06,654
- [Eduard] I, I thank
you for the new space.

809
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:10,759
- Well, that was not my doing.

810
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:16,096
So, why, why you building
this project again?

811
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:21,001
- I, we just want to
bring a touch of joy

812
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:24,138
and the Christmas
spirit to everyone.

813
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,641
- Right.

814
00:48:28,342 --> 00:48:30,244
I read the article
in the newsletter,

815
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:37,719
but I wanna know why

816
00:48:38,986 --> 00:48:40,588
you're really making it.

817
00:48:42,824 --> 00:48:46,293
- I, I, I, I don't
understand you, sir.

818
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:53,868
- No, of course you don't.

819
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:01,975
- Very surprised to
find you here, Captain.

820
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:04,679
- Oh, sir, I heard so
much about this project.

821
00:49:04,712 --> 00:49:07,448
I thought I'd take
a look for myself.

822
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:08,949
- It's gonna be magnificent.

823
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:11,519
- Yes, sir.

824
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:14,988
Magnificent.
- Yeah, Colonel,

825
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:17,257
I want you to meet someone here.

826
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,226
Colonel Lodell,
this is Eduard Kaib.

827
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:22,129
Eduard's the one responsible
for this project.

828
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:26,400
- Oh, it is an honor, sir.

829
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:30,572
I am very thankful for
the extra space here

830
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:33,675
and grateful that you're
allowing us to do this.

831
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:38,045
- We thought it'd be a very
unifying endeavor for everyone.

832
00:49:39,012 --> 00:49:40,414
But I didn't mean to interrupt.

833
00:49:40,447 --> 00:49:41,883
I have things to attend to.

834
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:42,983
Carry on, men.

835
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:49,858
- [Klein] Hey, sir,
if I could just have

836
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:51,091
a moment of your time.

837
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:54,596
- It's looking good, boys.

838
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:56,731
Who wants a candy cane?

839
00:49:56,764 --> 00:49:58,365
- Oh yes.
- Okay, yeah.

840
00:49:58,398 --> 00:49:59,767
Here you go.

841
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:02,704
(thunder booming)

842
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:12,647
(light dramatic music)

843
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:23,357
(light dramatic music continues)

844
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:33,400
(light dramatic music continues)

845
00:50:39,273 --> 00:50:43,343
(light dramatic music continues)

846
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:46,781
(Rudy sighing)

847
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,452
(lips smacking)

848
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:55,122
(Rudy groaning)

849
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:17,812
(water splashing)

850
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:30,692
(water splashing)

851
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:35,797
(dramatic music)

852
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,601
(light eerie music)

853

854
00:51:43,136 --> 00:51:45,773
(Klaus panting)

855
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:57,184
(Klaus speaking

856
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:03,190
(light eerie music continues)

857
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:23,044
(bell clangs)

858
00:52:24,946 --> 00:52:28,181
(car engine rumbling)

859
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:32,920
- Good morning, Carol.

860
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,656
- Morning, Mr. Tietz.

861
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:36,323
Hello, Donny.

862
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:38,158
- Hello, Ms. Valentine.

863
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,361
- Are you gonna hold
your father up all day

864
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:43,731
or would you like to
come and join the class?

865
00:52:43,765 --> 00:52:45,332
- All right, get going.

866
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:46,868
- Thanks for taking me, Dad.

867
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:54,509
- Hey, study hard.

868
00:52:55,475 --> 00:52:56,276
- I will.

869
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,455
- Rudy, this is Colonel Lodell.

870
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:10,925
- Colonel.
- Mr. Tietz.

871
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:14,896
- Rudy is fine.
- Rudy, heard a lot about you.

872
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:18,298
- Well, can't believe
everything you hear.

873
00:53:20,134 --> 00:53:22,402
- Why don't we sit down?
- Yeah, please do.

874
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:25,372
- [Waitress] Hi, Rudy.

875
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:26,941
Would you like some coffee?

876
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:28,408
- Black coffee would be great.

877
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:29,610
- [Waitress] How about
a danish or roll?

878
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,779
- Oh, no thank you.
- [Waitress] All right.

879
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,883
- Frank here is telling me
that you wanna be the first to

880
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:38,820
volunteer our camp
labor at your farm.

881
00:53:38,853 --> 00:53:41,589
- Yes, I heard that a
few companies in the area

882
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:42,857
are using the Germans.

883
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:47,095
- Yeah, but out on the
farm with your family.

884
00:53:47,128 --> 00:53:49,329
That's a different situation.

885
00:53:49,362 --> 00:53:51,298
- I'm aware there's a risk.

886
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,634
- These could be Nazis,
enemy walking amongst-

887
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:55,903
- A calculated risk.

888
00:53:59,774 --> 00:54:03,811
My father used to talk about
how the path to success

889
00:54:03,845 --> 00:54:05,079
is not a sure one.

890
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:09,984
If I don't get those
crops harvested,

891
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,890
I'm not gonna make it.
(somber music)

892
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:19,127
- Well, I heard you was in here
plotting to put them Germans

893
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,293
on our farms.

894
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,198
We'll just see about that.

895
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:34,008
(Colonel sighs)

896
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,743
- I like the way
you think, Rudy.

897
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,079
We're gonna help you.

898
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:43,251
- Thank you, sir.

with their illegal
businesses all over America,

917
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:36,764

- What's wrong?

925
00:57:20,274 --> 00:57:23,277
- We're having the Germans
come here, aren't we?

926
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:25,680
- It's nothing for
you to worry about.

927

You have homework to do?
- A little.

928

the hell you just said,

trees in the freezing cold

- It's close.

953
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:57,738
- Maybe we should all
go down to the cellar.

954
00:58:57,772 --> 00:58:59,340
- I'm going to bed.

955

Tomorrow morning, we
have workers coming.

decided on your own?

957

- [Rudy] Clara, please.

958
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:10,017
- To bring the enemy-
- Enough!

959
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:15,389
- God forbid something
should happen.

960
00:59:15,423 --> 00:59:17,825
- Unless God decides to
send a group of angels

961
00:59:17,858 --> 00:59:20,127
to help by morning, I'm
hiring them German boys

962
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:21,762

really trying here.

964
00:59:32,373 --> 00:59:34,708
And I'm sorry if you
don't agree with me.

to happen, okay?

get your learning.

Giving prisoners corn knives.

977
01:01:01,996 --> 01:01:03,364
Seems like a good idea.

978
01:01:06,535 --> 01:01:08,102
What? I was joking.

979
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:12,973
- I, uh, I think they're here.

980
01:01:15,042 --> 01:01:16,210

But in perhaps every home

and anxious thoughts will be

continually with the
millions of our loved ones

985
01:01:29,924 --> 01:01:32,459

hardships and misery,

986

who are risking their very
lives to preserve for us

987
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:40,635
and for all mankind the
fruits of his teaching

988

It's okay, kid.

You all right?

Lined a feather with an M1.

1027

out just fine today

1045
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,231
with those Germans.

1046
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:40,501
- You can call them prisoners.

1047
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:45,272
Glad the gamble worked
out in your favor.

1048
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,407

There, you happy now?

1051
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:04,759
- What'd you learn
today in school?

1052
01:07:05,894 --> 01:07:08,095
- Ms. Valentine taught
us about Harriet Quimby.

1053
01:07:09,263 --> 01:07:10,163
- Who?

1054
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:14,334
- The first female to
get her pilot's license.

1055
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:16,470
- [Rudy] Really?
- That's right.

1056
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:17,972
How'd you know that?

1057
01:07:18,006 --> 01:07:20,340
- You don't only get your love
of flight from your father.

1058
01:07:22,977 --> 01:07:24,746
- She was also the
first female pilot

1059
01:07:24,779 --> 01:07:26,648
to fly across the
English Channel.

1060
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:29,082
- Never heard that.

1061
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:30,018
- You know why?

1062
01:07:30,818 --> 01:07:32,452
Don't tell him, Mama.

1063
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:33,555
- I know the answer.

1064
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:37,190
- Great, just tell me.

1065
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,162
- Because the day Harriet Quimby
crossed the English Channel

1066
01:07:42,195 --> 01:07:44,164
was the same day
the Titanic sank.

1067
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:46,099
- April 15th, 1912.

1068
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:47,334
No newspaper stories.

1069
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:49,202
It was all about the Titanic.

1070
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:52,840
- Oh, the press.

1071
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:57,210

(Dedrick speaking
foreign language)

1083
01:08:57,071 --> 01:09:01,743
- Dedrick, (speaking
foreign language).

1084
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:20,160
(Dedrick speaking
foreign language)

1085
01:09:24,866 --> 01:09:29,169
(Eduard speaking

1086
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:44,552
(Dedrick speaking

1087
01:09:44,585 --> 01:09:47,155
(both chuckling)

1088
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:48,656
- Yeah, that's good.

1089
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:53,094
(Dedrick speaking
foreign language)

1090
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:04,237

(Dedrick speaking

1092
01:10:10,444 --> 01:10:11,411
- Oh, good.

1093
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:17,284
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

1094
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:23,223

(Eduard speaking

1098
01:10:50,585 --> 01:10:55,556
(dramatic music)
(prisoners laughing)

1099
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:07,034
- [Bugs Bunny] Eh,
what's up, doc?

1100
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:10,238
(prisoners cheering)

1101
01:11:11,239 --> 01:11:13,808
(light music)

1102
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:23,416
- You went too far, Frank.

1103
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,986
- Don't want to argue
with you today, Tom.

1104
01:11:25,019 --> 01:11:26,486
- That's just too
damn bad, Frank.

1105
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,189
If you're gonna go off and do
something stupid like this,

1106
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:29,657
you're gonna get a
piece of my mind.

1107
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:30,858
- [Frank] Tom, please.

1108
01:11:30,892 --> 01:11:33,027
- These German bastards
killed my grandson.

1109
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,729
Now I know we got
some Nazi loving

1110
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:35,897
sons of bitches in this town.

1111
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,364
I know it.

1112
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:39,834
But now you're gonna go off
and put the families in danger.

1113
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:40,935
- Morning, Tom.

1114
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:42,937
- Don't you "Morning"
me, Sheriff.

1115
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,806
Did you know about this?

1116
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:47,608
- Yeah, Norm and I checked it
out and it looks like it might

1117
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:49,010
just work out fine.

1118
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:50,343
- Might?

1119
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:52,345
Sheriff these ain't
supper guests.

1120
01:11:52,379 --> 01:11:54,481
These German bastards
are the enemy.

1121
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:58,052
- I know you're frustrated
and hurting badly,

1122
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:00,655
and I'm sorry about
your grandson, Tom.

1123
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:07,929
- I can see that the law
and the politically inept

1124
01:12:07,962 --> 01:12:09,329
are of no help to me.

1125
01:12:10,898 --> 01:12:12,066
- Tom!

1126
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:13,267
- But don't you
worry none, Sheriff.

1127
01:12:13,301 --> 01:12:15,570
I understand the situation now.

1128
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:17,470
Around here we take
care of our own!

1129
01:12:19,574 --> 01:12:22,109
- Oh, Tom sure is mad, isn't he?

1130
01:12:22,143 --> 01:12:23,010
- Yeah.

1131
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:24,444
He was born mad.

1132
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,648
- He sure did love that
grandson of his though.

1133
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:30,218
Practically raised
him as his own.

1134
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:33,754
- I just hope he don't
go do something stupid.

1135
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:38,391
(wind whistling)

1136
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:43,831
- Man, those German boys
worked really hard this week.

1137
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:46,934
I mean some of the hardest
workers I've ever come across.

1138
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:50,071
- Yeah, farm work allows
these men to spend time

1139
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:52,206
in a meaningful way.

1140
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,708
That's a good
situation for us all.

1141
01:12:53,741 --> 01:12:54,575
- [Rudy] Mm hm.

1142
01:12:56,777 --> 01:12:58,346
- You know Rudy,
you have really done

1143
01:12:58,378 --> 01:13:00,214
something special here.

1144
01:13:00,248 --> 01:13:04,518
It takes one man to stand up
and have courage and foresight.

1145
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:06,854
- Yeah, it was bound to happen.

1146
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:09,757
- Oh don't sell yourself short.

1147
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,424
I mean, it's special.

1148
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:14,161
It takes a special man to
stand up to be the first.

1149
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:18,666
- Talking about being the
first Black man in the area?

1150
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:20,167
- No.

1151
01:13:20,201 --> 01:13:22,136
I'm talking about being
the first Negro President

1152
01:13:22,169 --> 01:13:24,605
of these entire United States.

1153
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:31,178
Yes, I'm talking about being
the first Negro in the area.

1154
01:13:31,212 --> 01:13:34,115
(Rudy chuckling)

1155
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:37,551
- You know, we may just see
a Negro president one day.

1156
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:38,719
- Not in my lifetime.

1157
01:13:40,288 --> 01:13:41,889
- [Rudy] Don't sell
yourself short.

1158
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:43,490
(Rudy laughing)

1159
01:13:43,524 --> 01:13:44,692
- You got me all right.

1160
01:13:44,725 --> 01:13:45,893
- [Ruby] Let's
get this business-

1161
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,796
- Let's go young
Mr. Tietz. Let's go.

1162
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:51,365
(car doors slamming)

1163
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:53,901
(soft music)

1164
01:14:00,908 --> 01:14:04,011
My daddy used to say,
that when the sun sets

1165
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:06,647
it puts a long day to rest.

1166
01:14:08,481 --> 01:14:11,385
- Your daddy was right.
- Indeed he was.

1167
01:14:11,419 --> 01:14:12,620
William Hobb, sir.

1168
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:14,956
- Aaron Thompson.
- Ah, Lodell.

1169
01:14:16,057 --> 01:14:18,793
Commissioned to the
Corps of Engineers

1170
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:21,595
with the Army Officer
Reserve Corps.

1171
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:23,597
Indeed.

1172
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:27,735
My boy used to work at the
newspaper before he left

1173
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:29,737
for training in Alabama.

1174
01:14:31,539 --> 01:14:34,141
I like to know what
goes on in our town.

1175
01:14:34,175 --> 01:14:36,610
- Hm, where's he stationed now?

1176
01:14:39,947 --> 01:14:43,217
- We got the Western
Union eight months ago.

1177
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:45,353
He died in Italy.

1178
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:50,324
- You drink?
(William chuckling)

1179
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:53,294
- If you mean alcohol, I
do partake on occasion.

1180
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:55,329
- Never been to our club before.

1181
01:14:55,363 --> 01:14:56,764
(William chuckling)

1182
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:57,698
- Your club?

1183
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:00,468
Well, I don't believe any
Negroes have been in your club

1184
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,937
unless they were
playing music on stage.

1185
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:05,840
- Well, Negroes are
starting to make their mark

1186
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:07,375
in the military, William.

1187
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:11,078
I say that we have
a toast to your son.

1188
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:15,483
- Well, to answer your question,

1189
01:15:15,516 --> 01:15:19,320
it'd be a pleasurable first
to have a drink at your club.

1190
01:15:21,088 --> 01:15:23,024
- We're doing a lot
of firsts around here.

1191
01:15:23,057 --> 01:15:23,958
All right.

1192
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:26,727
- [Waiter] Everything
was acceptable, yeah?

1193
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:28,162
- Oh, very good. Thank you.

1194
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:34,568
- This is, this is classy.

1195
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,005
- Not bad.
- Mm hm.

1196
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:41,375
- I think we need a toast
to your son's service.

1197
01:15:41,409 --> 01:15:42,810
- Indeed.
(glasses clinking)

1198
01:15:42,843 --> 01:15:43,744
Yeah.

1199
01:15:49,183 --> 01:15:51,052
- Ah, that's, that's smooth.

1200
01:15:52,653 --> 01:15:54,221
- Templeton makes a nice blend.

1201
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:55,156
- [William] Hm.

1202
01:15:57,758 --> 01:16:01,796
- So William, how do you
think the town views our camp?

1203
01:16:02,963 --> 01:16:04,398
(William sighs)

1204
01:16:04,432 --> 01:16:07,234
- Oh, I think most respect
the work you're doing,

1205
01:16:07,268 --> 01:16:09,670
but others wish
you'd never showed.

1206
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:14,408
But the merchants in town,
oh, they like your business.

1207
01:16:14,442 --> 01:16:15,976
(William chuckling)

1208
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:19,380
- Well, we all probably
wish we were at home,

1209
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:20,281
that's for sure.

1210
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:23,384
- And perhaps one
day you will be.

1211
01:16:24,452 --> 01:16:27,556
But for now, welcome
to Algona, Iowa.

1212
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:29,757
The corn capital of the world.

1213
01:16:30,559 --> 01:16:31,826
- That it is.

1214
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:34,862
(glasses clinking)

1215
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:39,166
You know, at least these
German and American boys

1216
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:40,501
are not gonna die.

1217
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:43,270
And the parents may
thank us one day.

1218
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:46,307
I just hope our own
boys are getting

1219
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,741
the same kind of treatment.

1220
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,315
After dinner smoke?

1221
01:16:54,348 --> 01:16:55,249
- Oh, no, no, no.

1222
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:57,418
I, I have to limit my vices.

1223
01:16:58,352 --> 01:17:00,154
- Oh.
(William chuckling)

1224
01:17:00,187 --> 01:17:01,523
I like the way you
limit your vices.

1225
01:17:01,556 --> 01:17:02,756
- Ah, indeed.

1226
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:05,292
On the occasion that I do-
- Yeah.

1227
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:07,428
Partake in the smoke,

1228
01:17:07,461 --> 01:17:09,897
I'd rather it not be
with those dainty fags.

1229
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:10,831
Try one.

1230
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,668
- Don't mind if I do.
- All right.

1231
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:16,370
Let's do it.
- Nice.

1232
01:17:16,403 --> 01:17:18,172
- [Waiter] Would
you like another?

1233
01:17:19,574 --> 01:17:21,475
- A couple of beer chasers.

1234
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:22,309
- That sounds great.

1235
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:23,310
Two pints, please.

1236
01:17:25,246 --> 01:17:26,914
(William chuckling)

1237
01:17:26,947 --> 01:17:30,851
- Ah, yes, the A and
Eagle have learned to fly.

1238
01:17:32,419 --> 01:17:36,056
- That they have.

(Alfons speaking

1244
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,705
- Ah, Thanksgiving.
- [Alfons] Yeah.

(Eduard speaking

1246

(Alfons speaking
foreign language)

1247
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:57,639
- Yeah, (speaking
foreign language).

01:19:15,289 --> 01:19:16,524
(horn honking)

1252
01:19:16,558 --> 01:19:17,758
(drums beating)

1253
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:22,830
(audience cheering)
(audience applauding)

1254
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:51,992
- Hey, hey, Algona.

1255
01:19:52,026 --> 01:19:53,427
Happy Thanksgiving.

1256
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,530
I'm Smooth Dick and
these are the Dynamos.

1257
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:56,665
Let's get this place going.

1258
01:19:56,698 --> 01:19:58,332
Let's get in the mood right now.

1259
01:19:58,365 --> 01:19:59,833
One, two, a one, two, three.

1260
01:20:00,702 --> 01:20:03,772
(upbeat jazz music)

1261
01:20:10,144 --> 01:20:14,048
(upbeat jazz music continues)

1262
01:20:20,187 --> 01:20:24,091
(upbeat jazz music continues)

1263
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:34,134
(upbeat jazz music continues)

1264
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:44,078
(upbeat jazz music continues)

1265
01:20:50,484 --> 01:20:55,122
(upbeat jazz music continues)

1266
01:20:55,155 --> 01:20:58,058
- Those German boys
did a fine job.

1267
01:20:58,092 --> 01:21:00,528
- Don't get him started
about how right he was.

1268
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:09,671
- Well, everything looks
and smells real nice, Clara.

1269
01:21:09,704 --> 01:21:10,871
- Sure does.

1270
01:21:10,904 --> 01:21:12,574
Is there anything
that hasn't been done

1271
01:21:12,607 --> 01:21:14,141
that you could use help with?

1272
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:19,614
- Um no, I think
we're ready to eat.

1273
01:21:20,914 --> 01:21:22,416
(fist knocking)

1274
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:23,350
- I got it.

1275
01:21:26,353 --> 01:21:27,822
- You expecting anyone else?

1276
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:31,492
- Wow, little Donny.

1277
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:33,595
- Hello?

1278
01:21:33,628 --> 01:21:34,962
- Oh, Happy Thanksgiving.

1279
01:21:36,063 --> 01:21:37,464
- Carl.

1280
01:21:37,498 --> 01:21:39,199
Why, let Mr. Herman in, Donny.

1281
01:21:40,602 --> 01:21:42,336
- Didn't mean to
disturb you all.

1282
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:46,608
Missed you at our
gatherings, Clara.

1283
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:47,709
You know you promised.

1284
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:50,077
- I'm busy.

1285
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,278
- Too busy for the Lord.

1286
01:21:52,446 --> 01:21:54,549
- You can leave
that Bible outside.

1287
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:57,184
- Well, today is a day
of glorious thanks.

1288
01:21:57,217 --> 01:22:00,087
- Would the IOA people agree
with you on that point, Carl?

1289
01:22:01,321 --> 01:22:03,424
How about the Dakota Sioux?

1290
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:04,358
- Father.

1291
01:22:08,897 --> 01:22:11,833
- So how long have
you been a sheriff?

1292
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:13,934
- I'm, I'm not
actually a sheriff.

1293
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:15,436
I'm a sheriff's deputy.

1294
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:17,137
See, I was one, but-
- Oh.

1295
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:19,139
- Well, they pulled
me outta retirement

1296
01:22:19,173 --> 01:22:21,843
because the young guys
were off fighting.

1297
01:22:21,876 --> 01:22:22,844
- Okay.

1298
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:28,817
- Carl, I'd like you
to meet Ms. Valentine.

1299
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:30,284
- [Ms. Valentine] Pleasure.

1300
01:22:30,317 --> 01:22:32,921
- [Carl] Can't say I've seen
you at a church Sunday service.

1301
01:22:33,755 --> 01:22:34,823
- No.

1302
01:22:37,692 --> 01:22:40,127
- Um and this is-
- We've met.

1303
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:43,096
- Yes, yes we have.

1304
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:45,299
- Yeah, where would
that be, Norm?

1305
01:22:45,332 --> 01:22:50,404
- Well, now Mr. Herman here
decided to set up a holy rolling

1306
01:22:51,873 --> 01:22:53,775
fire and brimstone deal
at the courthouse one day

1307
01:22:53,808 --> 01:22:58,045
and got him a PA system and
almost got himself three days

1308
01:22:58,078 --> 01:23:00,113
in the lockup too, didn't he?

1309
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,249
- Well, the freedom
of speech, deputy.

1310
01:23:02,282 --> 01:23:04,953
- Yeah, that was
disturbing the peace.

1311
01:23:04,985 --> 01:23:06,888
You took freedom of
speech all the way

1312
01:23:06,921 --> 01:23:08,723
to freedom of screech.

1313
01:23:09,924 --> 01:23:13,126
And that's a civil
infraction in this community.

1314
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:15,362
- Well, we don't have
a microphone, Carl,

1315
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:19,399
but if you'd like to
sit and say grace,

1316
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:20,702
I guess we can feed you.

1317
01:23:22,302 --> 01:23:23,972
- I can get you a chair.

1318
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:25,573
- No thank you, Donny.

1319
01:23:31,144 --> 01:23:33,146
Well, if we'd all bow our heads.

1320
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:41,321
(Carl clears throat)

1321
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:43,457
Dear heavenly Father,

1322
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:46,126
thank you for bringing
us together today

1323
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:49,162
to celebrate this
joyous occasion.

1324
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:50,565
I pray that you bless the food

1325
01:23:50,598 --> 01:23:52,734
and the hands that prepared it.

1326
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:55,637
And Lord, we ask that you
allow us to glorify you

1327
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:59,239
in all that we do for
this festive night.

1328
01:23:59,273 --> 01:24:01,676
In the powerful name
of Jesus we pray.

1329
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:02,710
Amen.

1330
01:24:06,313 --> 01:24:09,216
(chairs creaking)

1331
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:12,787
(Alan speaking foreign language)

1332
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:14,022
- I'm gonna speak in English.

1333
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:17,391
So most all of you know me.

1334
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:19,326
I've had the pleasure
of meeting many of you

1335
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:21,996
and hearing about your families.

1336
01:24:23,765 --> 01:24:26,500
It's funny that we
are all here together

1337
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:29,403
at this place in time.

1338
01:24:29,436 --> 01:24:34,408
The war aside for a moment,
we should be grateful.

1339
01:24:36,143 --> 01:24:40,982
We all know fellow men,
soldiers, friends, brothers,

1340
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:46,921
sons who have died
in this conflict.

1341
01:24:48,322 --> 01:24:50,792
So I would like to take
a moment of silence

1342
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:55,863
and recognize our
fallen comrades.

1343
01:24:57,497 --> 01:24:59,232
A moment of silence, please.

1344
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:04,271
(drums beating)
(soft music)

1345
01:25:09,711 --> 01:25:10,612
Thank you.

1346
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:12,547
Thank you.

1347
01:25:14,048 --> 01:25:16,316
You know, I don't know how the
lines on a map will be drawn

1348
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:19,587
in the future, but I do know,

1349
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:24,191
I pray that one day
soon you will sit across

1350
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:27,562
from a loved one at a
table and share a meal.

1351
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:31,966
Here in the United States, we
call this day Thanksgiving.

1352
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:35,502
And I'm truly thankful to
be here with all of you.

1353
01:25:36,871 --> 01:25:39,907
And I hope that you can
remember your days as,

1354
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:45,813
as guests here in Algona.
(prisoners laughing)

1355
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:48,482
With a few smiles.

1356
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:51,119
And with that, I pray for peace.

1357
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,320
Please.
- Yeah, surely.

1358
01:25:53,353 --> 01:25:58,059
I would like to respond
to our gracious hosts.

1359
01:25:59,426 --> 01:26:03,296
Thank you Chaplain Alan for
those kind and true words.

1360
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:06,400
I've met the good
people of Algona,

1361
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:12,006
and I salute all the Americans
who performs their duties

1362
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,842
with honor and kindness.

1363
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:19,312
The hearts are
grateful and thankful.

1364
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,518
I too see the future
day when we all,

1365
01:26:23,551 --> 01:26:28,623
all of us will sit a table and
share the banquet by choice,

1366
01:26:30,925 --> 01:26:32,560
and not confinement.

1367
01:26:34,428 --> 01:26:36,798
Danke schoen.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

1368
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:38,800
(Seip speaking foreign language)

1369
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:43,403
(prisoners speaking
foreign language)

1370
01:26:46,808 --> 01:26:51,879
(Tom belching)

(dog barking)

1371
01:26:52,547 --> 01:26:53,715
- [Rudy] You okay, Tom?

1372
01:26:53,748 --> 01:26:56,084
- I was a friend of
your father, Rudy Tietz.

1373
01:26:56,117 --> 01:26:58,720
Traitor!
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, Tom!

1374
01:26:59,954 --> 01:27:01,789
All right, I got
no fight with you.

1375
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:04,559
(Tom groaning)

1376
01:27:04,592 --> 01:27:05,492
Tom.

1377
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:10,330
- This whole town has
lost its way, you know?

1378
01:27:10,363 --> 01:27:12,399
And I tried, I
tried to warn you,

1379
01:27:12,432 --> 01:27:15,302
but nobody's gonna listen to me.

1380
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:16,771
- [Rudy] Just tell me what?

1381
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:23,077
- Luke Luginsland, I told you.

1382
01:27:23,611 --> 01:27:24,946
- Told me what?

1383
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:26,214
What, what did Luke do?

1384
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:29,817
- Oh, you can't understand.

1385
01:27:29,851 --> 01:27:33,353
I don't know how a whole
town could be so blind.

1386
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:35,455
- I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1387
01:27:35,489 --> 01:27:36,791
Okay?

1388
01:27:36,824 --> 01:27:38,693
What about Luke Luginsland?

1389
01:27:40,293 --> 01:27:43,531
- Anyway, don't you
worry about it now.

1390
01:27:44,999 --> 01:27:46,466
(Tom chuckling)

1391
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:50,605
You know, I used to come here
and I talked to your father.

1392
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:51,639
Now he was a man.
- Tom.

1393
01:27:51,672 --> 01:27:52,907
- [Tom] He was a good man.

1394
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,809
He was a man that
would understand.

1395
01:27:54,842 --> 01:27:56,811
- You shouldn't be driving.

1396
01:27:56,844 --> 01:28:00,248
Hey.
(car engine rumbling)

1397
01:28:01,048 --> 01:28:02,250
It's Thanksgiving, Tom.

1398
01:28:04,819 --> 01:28:07,387
(dog barking)

1399
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:10,958
(somber music)

1400
01:28:15,763 --> 01:28:16,964
Luke Luginsland.

1401
01:28:21,202 --> 01:28:22,837
- Missed a good speech earlier.

1402
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:29,210
They're good men.

1403
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:33,480
- Yes, they are.

1404
01:28:34,582 --> 01:28:36,050
- Oh, you don't like turkey?

1405
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:39,153
No sauerkraut or schnitzel.

1406
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:44,058
- It's, it's fine.

1407
01:28:48,196 --> 01:28:49,797
- You're too noble, my friend.

1408
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:53,034
Can I tell you a story?

1409
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:59,941
- Please spare me the thankful
stories of the Indians

1410
01:28:59,974 --> 01:29:03,611
and, and turkey, and,
and how do you call them?

1411
01:29:03,644 --> 01:29:06,681
The men with the
boats and the hats.

1412
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:08,316
- Pilgrims.

1413
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:09,917
Yeah, no, no.

1414
01:29:09,951 --> 01:29:13,353
You'll like this story
better, especially the ending.

1415
01:29:13,386 --> 01:29:17,424
When Mary and Joseph
arrived in Bethlehem,

1416
01:29:17,457 --> 01:29:19,060
Mary was in labor.

1417
01:29:19,093 --> 01:29:20,828
She was about to give birth.

1418
01:29:20,862 --> 01:29:24,832
Joseph, he, he knew
that something amazing

1419
01:29:24,866 --> 01:29:29,070
was about to happen,
but he had nothing.

1420
01:29:30,605 --> 01:29:33,373
So, with hope and
humbleness in his heart,

1421
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:36,878
he went door to door
asking for help;

1422
01:29:36,911 --> 01:29:40,081
for a place to stay, a manger.

1423
01:29:42,617 --> 01:29:44,352
You have to ask
for help, Eduard.

1424
01:29:47,889 --> 01:29:49,389
- What are you talking about?

1425
01:29:50,725 --> 01:29:51,659
- The project.

1426
01:29:53,261 --> 01:29:54,362
Your project.

1427
01:29:58,666 --> 01:29:59,567
- What about it?

1428
01:30:00,868 --> 01:30:03,170
- No matter how many
night shifts you pick up.

1429
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:07,508
(Eduard crying)

1430
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:08,542
- I cannot.

1431
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:11,145
I'm tired and this is so hard.

1432
01:30:11,178 --> 01:30:15,049
And I cannot finish
by Christmas.

1433
01:30:17,685 --> 01:30:20,420
- Hey, not alone you can't.

1434
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:25,092
You have to ask for help.

1435
01:30:26,827 --> 01:30:31,265
Your men, they respect
you too much to offend you

1436
01:30:31,299 --> 01:30:33,334
by acting without
your permission.

1437
01:30:36,537 --> 01:30:38,339
Do you need help, Eduard?

1438
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:41,008
(gentle music)

1439
01:30:42,643 --> 01:30:46,047
(Eduard crying)

1440
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,048
- Yes, yes.

1441
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:52,586
(gentle music continues)

1442
01:30:56,624 --> 01:30:59,760
(prisoners whistling)

1443
01:31:15,209 --> 01:31:16,811
Klaus, Klaus.

1444
01:31:16,844 --> 01:31:20,214
(prisoners humming)

1445
01:31:20,247 --> 01:31:23,084
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

1446
01:31:23,117 --> 01:31:27,088
(prisoners humming continues)

1447
01:31:27,121 --> 01:31:31,425
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

1448
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,201
Okay.

1449
01:31:40,234 --> 01:31:44,672
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

1450
01:31:44,705 --> 01:31:49,043

01:32:07,828 --> 01:32:10,231
(Chaplain Fluke chuckling)

1453
01:32:10,264 --> 01:32:15,002
(prisoners singing

1454
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:25,713
(prisoners singing
in foreign language)

1455
01:32:28,816 --> 01:32:31,385
(Rudy groans)

1456
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,455
- How is everything today?

1457
01:32:34,488 --> 01:32:35,956
- Good.

1458
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:38,559
- [Helen] No school?
- We go back tomorrow.

1459
01:32:39,994 --> 01:32:41,662
- It's slow in here today.

1460
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:44,131
- Yeah, only the two of you.

1461
01:32:45,633 --> 01:32:49,737
Well, and that smooth
talking preacher earlier.

1462
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:51,639
Did he come by your place?

1463
01:32:51,672 --> 01:32:52,773
- What?

1464
01:32:52,807 --> 01:32:53,607
Carl Herman?

1465
01:32:54,509 --> 01:32:55,743
- Yeah.

1466
01:32:55,776 --> 01:32:57,845
He said he was going out
to meet with you all.

1467
01:33:02,551 --> 01:33:03,851
- Donny, let's go.

1468
01:33:03,884 --> 01:33:06,687
(coins rattling)

1469
01:33:40,087 --> 01:33:43,157
(children giggling)

1470
01:34:13,988 --> 01:34:18,225
(Klaus speaking
foreign language)

1471
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:29,937
(Klaus softly panting)

1472
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:39,113
(Klaus speaking
foreign language)

1473
01:34:55,262 --> 01:34:56,730
(somber music)

1474
01:34:56,764 --> 01:35:00,935
(Klaus speaking
foreign language)

1475
01:35:07,775 --> 01:35:10,744
(Klaus whimpering)

1476
01:35:15,249 --> 01:35:16,685
(Klaus crying)

1477
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:20,955
(Klaus speaking

1478
01:35:28,896 --> 01:35:31,365
(somber music continues)

1479
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:34,034
(Klaus crying)

1480
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:04,131
(Eduard speaking

(Klaus crying)

1482
01:36:17,077 --> 01:36:20,314
(car engine rumbling)

1483
01:36:23,784 --> 01:36:25,754
- Are we meeting
with Carl Herman?

1484
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:27,187
- So I'm told.

1485
01:36:27,221 --> 01:36:28,255
- [Donny] He's
here kind of early.

1486
01:36:28,289 --> 01:36:30,858
- He shouldn't be here at all!

1487
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:35,329
(car doors slamming)

1488
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:39,166
(Clara giggling)

1489
01:36:42,303 --> 01:36:43,738
- Good morning, Rudy.

1490
01:36:43,772 --> 01:36:46,240
(Rudy sighs)

1491
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:50,911
- I, I thought you were out
running errands all day.

1492
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,314
- Oh yeah, I guess I
forgot we had a meeting.

1493
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:56,050
- A meeting?
- Yeah.

1494
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:58,285
Didn't you tell Helen at the
diner you were coming out here

1495
01:36:58,319 --> 01:36:59,353
to meet with us?

1496
01:37:00,187 --> 01:37:01,656
- Well, Rudy, what I meant was-

1497
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:04,158
- Carl was just dropping
off some literature.

1498
01:37:06,894 --> 01:37:07,796
Donny.

1499
01:37:17,605 --> 01:37:18,773
You smell like coffee.

1500
01:37:19,607 --> 01:37:20,841
You've been drinking coffee?

1501
01:37:20,874 --> 01:37:23,911
- Yes, mama.
(hand slapping)

1502
01:37:23,944 --> 01:37:25,714
- Donny, outside.
- But-

1503
01:37:25,747 --> 01:37:27,281
- I said go outside now!

1504
01:37:30,518 --> 01:37:32,587
- You undermine my
every word and action.

1505
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,188
- It's coffee, Clara!

1506
01:37:34,221 --> 01:37:35,757
- I think maybe
I should just go.

1507
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:38,760
- Don't you move!

1508
01:37:38,793 --> 01:37:40,361
I'll get to you in a moment.

1509
01:37:41,696 --> 01:37:43,832
- Maybe if we had a little
more godliness in this house,

1510
01:37:43,864 --> 01:37:45,700
we wouldn't have
such disobedience.

1511
01:37:45,734 --> 01:37:48,770
- Oh yeah, I think we've
had enough godliness

1512
01:37:48,803 --> 01:37:50,437
visiting this household.

1513
01:37:51,773 --> 01:37:55,242
- Rudy, what I believe
that Donny needs-

1514
01:37:55,275 --> 01:37:57,911
- Don't you ever tell
me what Donny needs.

1515
01:37:57,945 --> 01:38:00,180
You understand?
(baby crying)

1516
01:38:00,214 --> 01:38:01,516
You may have my
wife's attention,

1517
01:38:01,549 --> 01:38:03,283
but you'll never have my son's.

1518
01:38:04,385 --> 01:38:07,421
- What, what are
you talking about?

1519
01:38:07,454 --> 01:38:09,223
- You and Gene can leave
with the preacher here

1520
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:10,924
if that's what you truly want.

1521
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:13,427
But Donny stays with me.

1522
01:38:14,928 --> 01:38:17,866
- Now, Rudy, I believe
we're having a bit of

1523
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:19,900
a misunderstanding here.

1524
01:38:21,068 --> 01:38:22,403
Can you let go?

1525
01:38:24,438 --> 01:38:27,876
- Are you going, Clara?
(baby crying)

1526
01:38:27,908 --> 01:38:31,245
(light dramatic music)

1527
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:37,819
- No.

1528
01:38:37,852 --> 01:38:41,121
(somber music)
(baby crying)

1529
01:38:41,155 --> 01:38:43,792
(Rudy panting)

1530
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,870
- When I come back, you
better be gone for good.

1531
01:39:04,846 --> 01:39:07,448
(Carl sighs)

1532
01:39:07,481 --> 01:39:10,217
(wind rustling)

1533
01:39:10,984 --> 01:39:15,723
Donny!

1534
01:39:15,757 --> 01:39:20,829
Hey, Donny!

1535
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:24,998
Donny!

1536
01:39:25,032 --> 01:39:27,769
(wind rustling)

1537
01:39:29,203 --> 01:39:31,338

(Klaus speaking

1543
01:40:09,243 --> 01:40:10,945
- Yeah.

1544
01:40:10,979 --> 01:40:13,380
(Alios speaking

1545
01:40:13,413 --> 01:40:15,182

(Dedrick speaking

1554
01:40:47,982 --> 01:40:52,052
- Hey, Klaus, (speaking
foreign language).

1555
01:40:52,085 --> 01:40:53,555
Come on, let's go.

1556
01:40:55,155 --> 01:40:56,290
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

1557
01:40:56,323 --> 01:40:57,124
- Okay.

1558
01:40:59,527 --> 01:41:04,431
(wind whistling)
(grass rustling)

1559
01:41:06,801 --> 01:41:09,069
- I'm running away and
I'm gonna be a pilot.

1560
01:41:10,170 --> 01:41:11,773
(wind howling)

1561

(prisoners cheering)
(prisoners laughing)

1562
01:41:24,886 --> 01:41:26,621
If I were a police officer,

1563
01:41:26,654 --> 01:41:29,857
I would arrest that
creepy Mr. Herman.

1564
01:41:29,891 --> 01:41:33,226
Stupid coffee and
calculated risk.

1565
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:36,363
(wind howling)

1566
01:41:36,396 --> 01:41:41,435

(leaves crunching)

1571
01:42:18,806 --> 01:42:20,240
- Mister, please, no.

1572
01:42:20,273 --> 01:42:22,744
- You German bastards
killed my grandson.

1573
01:42:23,878 --> 01:42:26,781
See, I knew you were
working with the enemy.

1574
01:42:26,814 --> 01:42:30,484
I just couldn't prove it
until I got my hands on these.

1575
01:42:30,518 --> 01:42:31,318
Huh?

1576
01:42:31,351 --> 01:42:32,520
What is this?

1577
01:42:32,553 --> 01:42:34,689
Trying to smuggle
letters on the inside.

1578
01:42:34,722 --> 01:42:35,890
What is that about?

1579
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:38,425
- My younger brother.

1580
01:42:39,594 --> 01:42:41,095
He was left in Germany.

1581
01:42:41,963 --> 01:42:43,698
- [Townie] You are a traitor!

1582
01:42:43,731 --> 01:42:45,967
(fist thudding)
(Luke groaning)

1583
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,036
- Tom, no.

1584
01:42:48,069 --> 01:42:53,141
(wind howling)
(grass rustling)

1585
01:42:54,142 --> 01:42:57,377
(light dramatic music)

1586
01:43:01,381 --> 01:43:04,519
My brother, he
raised by our uncle,

1587
01:43:04,552 --> 01:43:06,788
forced into the Wehrmacht.

1588
01:43:08,255 --> 01:43:12,894
I just want to know if
Martin is dead or alive.

1589
01:43:12,927 --> 01:43:14,996
I'm not a traitor.

1590
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:17,065
I'm an American.

1591
01:43:17,098 --> 01:43:19,399
Still, I love my brother.

1592
01:43:21,069 --> 01:43:21,969
(dramatic music)

1593
01:43:22,003 --> 01:43:23,938
- And I love my grandson.

1594
01:43:23,971 --> 01:43:27,041
(suspenseful music)

1595
01:43:30,078 --> 01:43:31,679
(prisoners cheering)

1596
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:33,480
- [Wade] Shoot him, Pa!

1597
01:43:33,514 --> 01:43:35,683
- [Donny] What are you
doing, Mr. Barrett?

1598
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:38,318
(dramatic music continues)

1599
01:43:38,351 --> 01:43:39,921
- [Wade] Pa, please
don't shoot the boy.

1600
01:43:39,954 --> 01:43:41,055
- Donny!

1601
01:43:41,089 --> 01:43:43,157
- Please don't hurt him.

1602
01:43:43,191 --> 01:43:45,993
(dramatic music)

1603
01:43:47,795 --> 01:43:50,064
(prisoners cheering)

1604
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:53,167
(suspenseful music)

1605
01:44:00,474 --> 01:44:03,111
(Tom panting)

1606
01:44:03,144 --> 01:44:04,746
- I'm sorry.

1607
01:44:04,779 --> 01:44:06,514
Wade, I wronged you,

1608
01:44:07,548 --> 01:44:10,051
and I'm so really sorry, son.

1609
01:44:12,086 --> 01:44:14,354
Do you forgive me?

1610
01:44:14,387 --> 01:44:16,190
- What are we gonna do?

1611
01:44:16,224 --> 01:44:19,026
(dramatic music)

1612
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:22,230
(prisoners cheering)

1613
01:44:22,262 --> 01:44:25,166
(gunshot banging)

1614
01:44:26,567 --> 01:44:27,467
- Donny!

1615
01:44:30,972 --> 01:44:31,873
Donny!

1616
01:44:33,340 --> 01:44:34,208
(Donny panting)

1617
01:44:34,242 --> 01:44:35,643
- They shot him!

1618
01:44:39,947 --> 01:44:42,415
(soft music)

1619
01:44:50,024 --> 01:44:53,360
(soft music continues)

1620
01:45:00,234 --> 01:45:03,503
(soft music continues)

1621
01:45:10,211 --> 01:45:13,514
(soft music continues)

1622
01:45:16,951 --> 01:45:20,188
(car engine rumbling)

1623
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:26,393
- Hey, have you seen Donny?

1624
01:45:27,662 --> 01:45:29,429
- Yeah, yeah, I've seen him.

1625
01:45:29,462 --> 01:45:30,330
- Where?

1626
01:45:36,037 --> 01:45:39,774
- Well, we, um, I saw
him out on Orton Road.

1627
01:45:44,579 --> 01:45:47,915
(car engine rumbling)

1628
01:45:47,949 --> 01:45:51,285
(soft music continues)

1629
01:45:53,420 --> 01:45:56,123
- Yes (speaking
foreign language).

1630
01:45:56,157 --> 01:45:57,058
- Hey.

1631
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:12,807
(prisoners speaking
foreign language)

1632
01:46:16,811 --> 01:46:19,714
(gunshot banging)

1633
01:46:23,584 --> 01:46:25,987
All this good will to men,

1634
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:28,222
peace and art talk.

1635
01:46:28,256 --> 01:46:29,489
You're up to something
and I know it.

1636
01:46:29,523 --> 01:46:32,126
- I, I don't understand, just...

1637
01:46:34,228 --> 01:46:35,129
(body thumping)

1638
01:46:35,162 --> 01:46:36,130
- Leave him alone, asshole.

1639
01:46:38,633 --> 01:46:39,533
We are like you.

1640
01:46:41,903 --> 01:46:43,237
We are all like you!

1641
01:46:43,271 --> 01:46:47,575
(Eduard speaking
foreign language)

1642
01:46:54,414 --> 01:46:57,151
- What did you just say?

1643
01:46:57,184 --> 01:46:59,687
I know you're spitting
your Nazi poison.

1644
01:47:00,855 --> 01:47:05,059
- I, I'm just a
German, not a Nazi.

1645
01:47:07,094 --> 01:47:09,330
I only wish to see
my family again.

1646
01:47:11,431 --> 01:47:15,336
Please, don't become
what you wish to destroy.

1647
01:47:16,404 --> 01:47:19,740
(light dramatic music)

1648
01:47:26,247 --> 01:47:30,418
(light dramatic music continues)

1649
01:47:36,157 --> 01:47:40,328
(light dramatic music continues)

1650
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:50,338
(light dramatic music continues)

1651
01:47:58,145 --> 01:48:01,315
(prisoners chuckling)

1652
01:48:10,124 --> 01:48:14,428
(prisoners speaking
foreign language)

1653
01:48:14,462 --> 01:48:18,632
(light dramatic music continues)

1654
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:28,342
(light dramatic music continues)

1655
01:48:35,516 --> 01:48:37,218
- Sergeant.

1656
01:48:37,251 --> 01:48:38,886
Gather the troops.

1657
01:48:38,919 --> 01:48:39,787
- Yes, sir.

1658
01:48:45,926 --> 01:48:47,461
(door slamming)

1659
01:48:47,495 --> 01:48:50,131
(Lodell sighs)

1660
01:48:51,499 --> 01:48:54,301
(wind whistling)

1661
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:02,243
- Hey, where's home boy?

1662
01:49:02,276 --> 01:49:03,477
Where's home? Home.

1663
01:49:03,512 --> 01:49:05,679
No, no, not play.

1664
01:49:05,713 --> 01:49:06,614
Home.

1665
01:49:09,383 --> 01:49:11,385
(leaves crunching)

1666
01:49:11,419 --> 01:49:13,654
- [Lodell] Your name, soldier,
for those who don't know you.

1667
01:49:13,687 --> 01:49:16,957
- Sergeant Conrad Lewis of
Brooklyn, New York, sir!

1668
01:49:16,991 --> 01:49:20,194
- Are we not the one and only
United States of America?

1669
01:49:20,227 --> 01:49:21,395
- [Soldiers] Yes, sir.

1670
01:49:22,763 --> 01:49:25,633
- Those uniforms
that you all wear,

1671
01:49:25,666 --> 01:49:29,136
they're a symbol of duty,
honor, and sacrifice.

1672
01:49:30,404 --> 01:49:33,240
But they're just a reflection
of the soldier within.

1673
01:49:34,642 --> 01:49:38,779
From now on, I expect
your behavior to reflect

1674
01:49:38,813 --> 01:49:41,148
the fine reputation
that has become known

1675
01:49:41,182 --> 01:49:43,751
for the United States military.

1676
01:49:43,784 --> 01:49:46,454
Is that understood?
- [Soldiers] Yes sir.

1677
01:49:46,487 --> 01:49:47,955
- We are common men.

1678
01:49:49,356 --> 01:49:54,395
But together we are capable
of uncommon acts of courage,

1679
01:49:55,062 --> 01:49:56,764
bravery and compassion.

1680
01:49:58,699 --> 01:50:02,937
History will remember our
actions for generations.

1681
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:06,841
We will determine how the
world sees and remembers us.

1682
01:50:07,908 --> 01:50:09,511
Dismissed.

1683
01:50:09,544 --> 01:50:11,445
Find me Provost Marshal Klein,

1684
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:14,281
have him report to my
office immediately.

1685
01:50:14,315 --> 01:50:17,618
(light dramatic music)

1686
01:50:18,619 --> 01:50:19,521
- Hey, hey.

1687
01:50:22,456 --> 01:50:23,657
- I did this.

1688
01:50:23,691 --> 01:50:25,092
- No, don't, don't
do that to yourself.

1689
01:50:25,126 --> 01:50:26,861
(Clara sniffling)
Don't do that.

1690
01:50:28,129 --> 01:50:29,463
- We can't lose him.
- Hey, hey.

1691
01:50:31,265 --> 01:50:32,867
We're gonna find him.

1692
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,502
Okay?

1693
01:50:34,536 --> 01:50:36,538
Okay, we're gonna find him.

1694
01:50:36,571 --> 01:50:41,642
(Clara crying)
(somber music)

1695
01:50:46,548 --> 01:50:49,950
(somber music continues)

1696
01:50:51,685 --> 01:50:55,823
- Now, Donny has good common
sense and I need to think

1697
01:50:55,856 --> 01:50:57,391
that Buster's with him.

1698
01:50:57,424 --> 01:50:58,926
- Yeah, he may have
good common sense,

1699
01:50:58,959 --> 01:51:00,861
but he doesn't
have a coat on him.

1700
01:51:00,895 --> 01:51:03,097
Okay, Buster can
only help so much.

1701
01:51:07,768 --> 01:51:10,404
(Clara crying)

1702
01:51:11,606 --> 01:51:13,407
- Listen, listen to me.

1703
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,209
I know you're scared.

1704
01:51:15,242 --> 01:51:16,977
But we're gonna find him.

1705
01:51:17,011 --> 01:51:18,179
Okay, you have to believe me.

1706
01:51:18,212 --> 01:51:20,281
I know we are, we're
gonna find him.

1707
01:51:20,314 --> 01:51:23,484
- [Clara] Okay.
- Okay, come on boys.

1708
01:51:25,019 --> 01:51:26,287
We are.

1709
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:27,121
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1710
01:51:27,154 --> 01:51:28,055
Come on.

1711
01:51:32,293 --> 01:51:34,895
Okay, okay, listen up everyone.

1712
01:51:34,929 --> 01:51:36,764
We need to start
west of the woods

1713
01:51:36,797 --> 01:51:38,899
and work our way
back to the river.

1714
01:51:38,933 --> 01:51:41,536
We should be able to cover
a lot of ground that way.

1715
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:44,338
What?

1716
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:47,107
Did you think I was
just gonna sit back,

1717
01:51:47,141 --> 01:51:49,076
serve coffee and fret?

1718
01:51:49,109 --> 01:51:50,211
Absolutely not!

1719
01:51:50,244 --> 01:51:51,045
Now, let's go!

1720
01:51:51,078 --> 01:51:51,879
Let's find him!

1721
01:51:51,912 --> 01:51:53,180
We have to find him!

1722
01:51:53,214 --> 01:51:54,415
- All right, let's go.

1723
01:51:54,448 --> 01:51:55,783
It's only gonna get
colder out here.

1724
01:51:58,452 --> 01:51:59,920
- God bless you all.

1725
01:51:59,954 --> 01:52:02,356
- We're start on this road
and work our way back.

1726
01:52:03,625 --> 01:52:06,427
(wind whistling)

1727
01:52:12,466 --> 01:52:14,268
- It's getting cold
out there, sir.

1728
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:17,938
- I'm gonna get right
to the point, Captain.

1729
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:22,510
Who organizes the tower
shifts and the escort duties

1730
01:52:22,544 --> 01:52:23,511
for this camp?

1731
01:52:25,045 --> 01:52:26,113
- I do, sir.

1732
01:52:28,015 --> 01:52:29,850
- Who do the men
look to for guidance

1733
01:52:29,883 --> 01:52:32,419
on their day-to-day
duties and actions?

1734
01:52:35,956 --> 01:52:39,426
- Sir, I'm not getting your
line of questioning here.

1735
01:52:39,460 --> 01:52:41,895
- I did not ask if you got
my line of questioning.

1736
01:52:41,929 --> 01:52:45,132
I asked, who do the men
look to for guidance?

1737
01:52:45,165 --> 01:52:47,835
Who sets the example of
what kind of behavior

1738
01:52:47,868 --> 01:52:50,304
is acceptable or tolerated?

1739
01:52:52,707 --> 01:52:54,275
- Okay.

1740
01:52:54,308 --> 01:52:56,711
Is this about the incident in
the yard with a soccer ball?

1741
01:52:56,745 --> 01:52:58,045
'Cause I can explain that-

1742
01:52:58,078 --> 01:52:59,313
- Enough, Captain.

1743
01:52:59,346 --> 01:53:01,549
I swear if you dodge one
more direct question,

1744
01:53:01,583 --> 01:53:04,485
you're gonna be court-martialed:
Insubordination.

1745
01:53:04,519 --> 01:53:05,720
Do you understand me?

1746
01:53:07,722 --> 01:53:09,591
- Me, sir.

1747
01:53:09,624 --> 01:53:12,359
Yes, they look to me.

1748
01:53:12,393 --> 01:53:14,596
It was a soccer ball, sir.

1749
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:16,997
Those men were
being disrespectful.

1750
01:53:17,031 --> 01:53:18,932
Herman Seip reported
this, didn't he?

1751
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,136
You can't trust
their reports, sir.

1752
01:53:22,169 --> 01:53:23,605
These men are criminals.

1753
01:53:23,638 --> 01:53:26,608
- No, I saw what happened.

1754
01:53:26,641 --> 01:53:27,609
All of it.

1755
01:53:28,842 --> 01:53:32,313
These men are prisoners of war.

1756
01:53:32,346 --> 01:53:34,248
Many of 'em forced to
fight in a conflict

1757
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:36,216
they wanted no part of.

1758
01:53:37,552 --> 01:53:41,255
Do you know what the main
requirement of leadership is?

1759
01:53:42,823 --> 01:53:44,024
- No, sir.

1760
01:53:45,025 --> 01:53:46,628
- The main requirement
of leadership

1761
01:53:46,661 --> 01:53:49,531
is that you must
be a human being.

1762
01:53:51,131 --> 01:53:52,634
The eyes of the
world are upon us

1763
01:53:52,667 --> 01:53:54,602
and how we perform our duty.

1764
01:53:54,636 --> 01:53:58,072
Our own boys, our
prisoners in German camps,

1765
01:53:58,105 --> 01:53:59,940
and how we perform
our duty may affect

1766
01:53:59,973 --> 01:54:00,908
the way they're treated.

1767
01:54:00,941 --> 01:54:02,843
Did that ever occur to you?

1768
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:06,681
- No, sir.

1769
01:54:06,715 --> 01:54:08,650
- You have a brother
that serves, yes?

1770
01:54:10,050 --> 01:54:13,187
- Yes, sir, a B-17
pilot based in England.

1771
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:16,558
- And if he was shot
down and taken captive,

1772
01:54:16,591 --> 01:54:18,593
how would you want
him to be treated?

1773
01:54:20,628 --> 01:54:24,699
The golden rule, Captain,
respect has to be earned.

1774
01:54:24,733 --> 01:54:26,634
It cannot be demanded.

1775
01:54:26,668 --> 01:54:27,901
You don't respect these men

1776
01:54:27,935 --> 01:54:29,771
and therefore they
don't respect you.

1777
01:54:29,804 --> 01:54:32,607
You crossed a line
and broke their trust.

1778
01:54:32,640 --> 01:54:33,541
- [Linda] Sir.

1779
01:54:34,743 --> 01:54:36,343
- Poor leadership.

1780
01:54:36,377 --> 01:54:38,847
Poor leadership.

1781
01:54:38,879 --> 01:54:40,648
You're no good to me anymore

1782
01:54:40,682 --> 01:54:43,283
except to make an
example out of you.

1783
01:54:43,317 --> 01:54:46,353
You're hereby being
transferred to another site.

1784
01:54:46,387 --> 01:54:49,390
And Captain, I sincerely hope
that you make better choices

1785
01:54:49,423 --> 01:54:51,024
in the future.

1786
01:54:51,058 --> 01:54:54,094
The train leaves 0700.

1787
01:54:54,128 --> 01:54:55,028
Dismissed.

1788
01:54:59,066 --> 01:54:59,933
- Yes, sir.

1789
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:06,674
- Yes, Linda?

1790
01:55:07,742 --> 01:55:10,310
- Sir, Mayor Frank
Hewitt called and said

1791
01:55:10,344 --> 01:55:13,280
there's a local boy missing
in the surrounded woods.

1792
01:55:13,313 --> 01:55:15,650
- Tonight? In this?

1793
01:55:15,683 --> 01:55:16,851
Who is it?

1794
01:55:16,885 --> 01:55:19,086
- It's the young
son of a Rudy Tietz.

1795
01:55:20,954 --> 01:55:24,057
- Sergeant, step aside.

1796
01:55:24,091 --> 01:55:27,227
(ominous music)

1797
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:28,162
- Yes, sir.

1798
01:55:34,234 --> 01:55:37,806
(ominous music continues)

1799
01:55:39,106 --> 01:55:44,178
(prisoners speaking
foreign language)

1800
01:55:44,978 --> 01:55:48,449
(suspenseful music continues)

1801
01:55:48,482 --> 01:55:49,818
- Hold on here.

1802
01:55:50,618 --> 01:55:52,854
(suspenseful music continues)

1803
01:55:52,887 --> 01:55:55,088
- Whatever I've
done to you, sir.

1804
01:55:55,122 --> 01:55:56,624
I'm deeply sorry.

1805
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:02,730
- No, Eduard, I'm sorry.

1806
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,072
My actions were inexcusable.
(light music)

1807
01:56:15,643 --> 01:56:19,313
I sincerely hope that soon
we can get back to our lives

1808
01:56:20,815 --> 01:56:21,883
and our families.

1809
01:56:24,418 --> 01:56:26,654
Accept my apology, please.

1810
01:56:29,958 --> 01:56:33,293
(light dramatic music)

1811
01:56:40,234 --> 01:56:44,404

(Seip speaking foreign language)

1814
01:56:56,551 --> 01:56:58,686
- Men, we need your help.

1815
01:56:59,921 --> 01:57:02,322
(soft music)

1816
01:57:13,601 --> 01:57:15,068
- [Donny] Please.

1817
01:57:17,371 --> 01:57:21,809
(search crew
indistinctly talking)

1818
01:57:21,843 --> 01:57:25,178
- We should be able to cover
a lot of ground that way.

1819
01:57:25,212 --> 01:57:27,682
(soft music)

1820
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:34,889
(light dramatic music)

(Seip speaking foreign language)

1823
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:01,683
- How can we help?

1824
01:58:03,116 --> 01:58:04,318
(light dramatic music continues)

1825
01:58:04,351 --> 01:58:08,590
- [Harriet] Donny!
(indistinct yelling)

1826
01:58:08,623 --> 01:58:10,692
- [Rudy] Come on, Donny!

1827
01:58:12,527 --> 01:58:13,861
- Donny!

1828
01:58:13,895 --> 01:58:15,630
Donny!
- [Tom] Donny!

1829
01:58:21,435 --> 01:58:24,539
- Donny!
(muffled yelling)

1830
01:58:24,572 --> 01:58:26,139
- [Harriet] Donny!

1831
01:58:36,017 --> 01:58:36,818
(leaves crunching)

1832
01:58:36,851 --> 01:58:37,752
Donny!

1833
01:58:41,388 --> 01:58:44,458
(light eerie music)

1834
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:51,498
(Klaus speaking
foreign language)

(light music)

1836
01:58:58,706 --> 01:59:00,108
Here, he's here!

1837
01:59:02,175 --> 01:59:04,646
- We surrender, we surrender.

1838
01:59:09,383 --> 01:59:11,418
- [Klaus] You okay?

1839
01:59:11,451 --> 01:59:14,856
(light music continues)

1840
01:59:19,794 --> 01:59:21,529
You're safe now.

1841
01:59:21,562 --> 01:59:23,296
- [Alan] Let's get you home.

1842
01:59:23,330 --> 01:59:24,398
- Thank you.

1843
01:59:25,298 --> 01:59:27,902
(gentle music)

1844
01:59:35,242 --> 01:59:38,746
(gentle music continues)

1845
01:59:42,382 --> 01:59:43,618
- Is it Donny?

1846
01:59:45,086 --> 01:59:47,922
Donny!
(triumphant music)

1847
01:59:47,955 --> 01:59:50,525
Oh, you scared me good.

1848
01:59:50,558 --> 01:59:52,492
- [Donny] I'm sorry I ran away.

1849
01:59:54,595 --> 01:59:55,563
- You're safe now.

1850
01:59:58,398 --> 02:00:01,234
- I knew I should
have taken my coat.

1851
02:00:01,268 --> 02:00:02,502
- Yeah.

1852
02:00:02,537 --> 02:00:05,305
- You always tell
me to get my coat.

1853
02:00:05,338 --> 02:00:07,742
- Yes, sir, you should have.

1854
02:00:11,846 --> 02:00:12,747
Thank you.

1855
02:00:15,348 --> 02:00:20,420
- Hey, I once knew a
boy as brave as you.

1856
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:25,693
And he gave me this.

1857
02:00:37,138 --> 02:00:40,908
Helped me through very hard
times and I want you to have it.

1858
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:45,179
(gentle music)

1859
02:00:47,447 --> 02:00:50,084
- Thank you.
- [Rudy] Thank you.

1860
02:00:50,118 --> 02:00:53,521
(gentle music continues)

1861
02:00:58,659 --> 02:01:01,495

(Clara crying)

1864
02:01:14,642 --> 02:01:16,077
- Donny!

1865
02:01:16,110 --> 02:01:17,011
I'm sorry.

1866
02:01:21,381 --> 02:01:22,784
We found you.

1867
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:26,220
(light music continues)

1868
02:01:32,193 --> 02:01:35,596

(baby crying)
(Clara hushes)

1872
02:02:07,094 --> 02:02:08,596
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1873
02:02:08,629 --> 02:02:10,264
Come here, come here.

1874
02:02:10,298 --> 02:02:12,667
Hero or no hero, kid,
he needs his feet wiped.

1875
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:13,734
Hand me that rag.

1876
02:02:15,136 --> 02:02:17,872
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

1877
02:02:17,905 --> 02:02:18,806
Thank you.

1878
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:20,541
I know.

1879
02:02:21,542 --> 02:02:22,610
Yeah.

1880
02:02:22,643 --> 02:02:24,078
It's okay boy.

1881
02:02:24,111 --> 02:02:26,747
- Just gonna leave all that
mess at the door, Donny?

1882
02:02:26,781 --> 02:02:28,182
- I was gonna go
back out with Buster

1883
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:30,483
after I got some hot chocolate.

1884
02:02:30,518 --> 02:02:32,220
- Oh, we're out
of hot chocolate.

1885
02:02:34,055 --> 02:02:36,657
But we do have some coffee.

1886
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:42,063
If you'd like some.

1887
02:02:42,096 --> 02:02:42,997
- Really?

1888
02:02:50,004 --> 02:02:52,439
- We've been invited to
go down to the PW camp

1889
02:02:52,472 --> 02:02:54,342
for some Christmas presentation.

1890
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:57,245
- That sounds fun.

1891
02:03:00,413 --> 02:03:03,416
- That sounds really nice.

1892
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:09,223
- Well then, looks
like the Tietz family

1893
02:03:09,257 --> 02:03:10,725
will be in attendance.

1894
02:03:13,426 --> 02:03:16,063
(glasses clinking)
My little man.

1895
02:03:16,097 --> 02:03:17,531
(Clara giggling)

1896
02:03:17,565 --> 02:03:20,400
("O Holy Night")

1897
02:03:21,369 --> 02:03:22,603
- [President Roosevelt]
Here at home,

1898
02:03:22,637 --> 02:03:25,405
we will celebrate in our
traditional American way

1899
02:03:25,438 --> 02:03:29,043
because of its deep
spiritual meaning to us.

1900
02:03:29,076 --> 02:03:32,847
Because the teachings of Christ
are fundamental in our lives

1901
02:03:34,148 --> 02:03:37,752
and because we want our
youngest generation to grow up

1902
02:03:37,785 --> 02:03:41,188
knowing the significance
of this tradition,

1903
02:03:41,222 --> 02:03:42,523
and the story of the coming of

1904
02:03:42,556 --> 02:03:45,960
the immortal prince
of peace and goodwill.

1905
02:03:47,395 --> 02:03:50,665
But in perhaps every home
in the United States,

1906
02:03:50,698 --> 02:03:54,201
sad and anxious thoughts
will be continually

1907
02:03:54,235 --> 02:03:56,003
with the millions
of our loved ones

1908
02:03:56,037 --> 02:03:59,206
who are suffering
hardships and misery,

1909
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:02,442
who are risking their very
lives to preserve for us

1910
02:04:02,475 --> 02:04:06,113
and for all mankind the
fruits of his teachings

1911
02:04:06,147 --> 02:04:09,283
and the foundations of
civilization itself.

1912
02:04:10,751 --> 02:04:14,055
The Christmas spirit lives
tonight in the bitter cold

1913
02:04:14,088 --> 02:04:16,624
of the front lines in Europe,

1914
02:04:16,657 --> 02:04:19,226
and in the heat of the
jungles and swamps of Burma

1915
02:04:20,161 --> 02:04:21,429
and the Pacific Islands.

1916
02:04:23,798 --> 02:04:24,932
(Sally sighs)

1917
02:04:24,966 --> 02:04:26,767
Even the roar of our-

1918
02:04:26,801 --> 02:04:29,203
- Well, you better
go get cleaned up.

1919
02:04:29,236 --> 02:04:30,905
- [President Roosevelt] The
guns of our ships at sea.

1920
02:04:30,938 --> 02:04:34,208
- I mean, if you wanted to
go to the Christmas gala.

1921
02:04:34,241 --> 02:04:35,242
- Really?
- Yeah.

1922
02:04:35,276 --> 02:04:36,177
- Oh!

1923
02:04:38,346 --> 02:04:39,246
Thank you.

1924
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:44,118
- All right, hurry up.

1925
02:04:44,151 --> 02:04:47,722
- [President Roosevelt]
Around our Christmas tree.

- It's a beautiful
night for a surprise.

1931
02:05:18,652 --> 02:05:23,257
- Yeah, this is the most fun I
have had in a very long time.

1932
02:05:23,290 --> 02:05:24,492
- You good?
- I'm good.

1933
02:05:24,525 --> 02:05:25,693
- Are you warm?
- Yeah, I'm warm.

1934
02:05:25,726 --> 02:05:27,028
- All right, we
gotta keep you warm.

1935
02:05:27,061 --> 02:05:28,029
- I'll keep warm.

1936
02:05:28,062 --> 02:05:30,998
- They should be
out in a minute.

1937
02:05:31,032 --> 02:05:32,933
- Oh, Merry Christmas.

1938
02:05:33,901 --> 02:05:35,469
- Merry Christmas.

(indistinct whispering)

1940
02:05:44,145 --> 02:05:45,546
- It truly did.

1941
02:05:45,579 --> 02:05:48,015
I can't thank you for
everything that you did for me

1942
02:05:48,049 --> 02:05:49,784
and for my family.

1943
02:05:49,817 --> 02:05:52,987
(indistinct talking)

1944
02:06:00,661 --> 02:06:01,962
Is he warm enough?

1945
02:06:08,636 --> 02:06:12,073
(lips smacking)

1946
02:06:12,106 --> 02:06:13,307

- Merry Christmas.

1948
02:06:17,078 --> 02:06:18,079
I love you.

1949
02:06:19,346 --> 02:06:20,848

- Welcome, everyone.

1956
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:16,737
Thank you for coming out tonight

1957
02:07:16,770 --> 02:07:19,773
on this Christmas Eve of 1944.

1958
02:07:21,709 --> 02:07:25,146
We're here to celebrate
an opportunity for peace

1959
02:07:25,179 --> 02:07:26,080
in this world.

1960
02:07:27,616 --> 02:07:31,685
These men, who are so
far from their home,

1961
02:07:32,953 --> 02:07:35,756
have created something
for our home,

1962
02:07:35,789 --> 02:07:38,593
and hopefully it'll be with
us for many years to come.

1963
02:07:40,427 --> 02:07:44,999
So with the Christmas spirit,
I pray for peace on earth.

all know how anxious they are

to be home with us,

1982
02:09:57,031 --> 02:10:00,334
and they know how anxious
we are to have them.

1983
02:10:00,367 --> 02:10:03,837
And how determined every one
of us is to make their day

1984

of homecoming as
early as possible.

1985
02:10:08,375 --> 02:10:11,945
And above all, they know
the determination of

1986
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:15,082
all right thinking
people and nations,

1987
02:10:16,450 --> 02:10:19,186
that Christmases such as those
that we have known in these

years of world tragedy
shall not come back again

1989

the children of God.

1998
02:11:50,845 --> 02:11:52,279
Good morning.

1999
02:11:52,312 --> 02:11:54,915
I'd like to introduce
you to Mr. Don Tietz.

2000
02:11:56,618 --> 02:11:59,052
And Kim, our local
news reporter.

2001
02:11:59,086 --> 02:12:00,154
- [Kim] Nice to meet you.

2002
02:12:00,187 --> 02:12:02,055
- Yes, when I was a young boy,

2003
02:12:02,089 --> 02:12:04,859
I remember your men
working on my dad's farm.

2004
02:12:04,893 --> 02:12:06,960
I recall them being so
nice to us, so thank you.

2005
02:12:06,994 --> 02:12:07,896
- Thank you.

2006
02:12:09,263 --> 02:12:11,866
- Mr. Kaib, how does it feel
to return to the very spot

2007
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:13,500
where you were once imprisoned?

2008
02:12:15,135 --> 02:12:18,740
- I find this second
visit to Algona to be

2009
02:12:18,773 --> 02:12:21,743
much more pleasurable
than the first.

2010
02:12:21,776 --> 02:12:23,711
I've seen more of
the town this time.

2011
02:12:25,279 --> 02:12:27,782
Would you care to walk with
me to where the camp was?

2012
02:12:27,816 --> 02:12:28,850
- [Don] Yeah.
- Yes.

2013

(light music)

2015
02:12:51,505 --> 02:12:55,075
- Mr. Kaib, what was
behind such a huge endeavor

2016
02:12:55,108 --> 02:12:57,010
as the nativity scene?

2017
02:12:57,044 --> 02:13:00,347

(light music continues)

2021
02:13:37,184 --> 02:13:41,689
- [Eduard] I never intended
to create a piece of art.

2022
02:13:43,490 --> 02:13:47,629
The only intention when
making the nativity scene

2023
02:13:47,662 --> 02:13:52,734
was to help to bring the joy
of Christmas to our camp.

2024
02:13:53,902 --> 02:13:57,070
And you can imagine
that I was very glad

2025
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:03,176
that the nativity scene,
still after 40 years,

2026
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:05,880
help to heal the wounds of war.
