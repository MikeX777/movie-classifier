00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,541
{\an8}That goes outside.

00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,666
{\an8}Got it.

00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,833
{\an8}Thank you.

5
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,291
{\an8}Morning.

6
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,083
{\an8}It's also good for storing genomes.

00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,708
How was the dive yesterday, Tsuneo?

11
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,500
I saw a Priolepis nocturna.

12
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,583
That's awesome!

13
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,666
I was lucky the sea was so calm.

14
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,958
You're on summer break from college?

15
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,375
That's right.

16
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,291
How about doing a dive next Wednesday?

17
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,208
Sure!

18
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,208
Bring some girls too.

19
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,375
Sorry?

20
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,333
At this rate, fish will be our only love.

21
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,208
But I long for a human one. Right, Tsuneo?

22
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,125
No time for that.

23
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,458
I start another part-time job next week.

24
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,458
You're wasting your youth.

25
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,250
The summer of 22 comes only once.

26
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,083
Whatever.

27
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,625
Tsuneo!

28
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,791
Thank you.

00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,208
Is this the right way?

31
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,125
Help!

32
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,541
That hurts.

33
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,416
Are you okay?

34
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,000
Kumiko!

35
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,250
Kumiko, are you all right?

36
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,000
Did you save her, young man? Thank you.

37
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:37,916
No.

38
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,666
Are you injured?

39
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,333
I think I'm fine.

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,875
I turn away for one second,
and someone pushes her.

41
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,916
I almost had a heart attack.

42
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,250
That hurts! Why did you do that?

43
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,375
Pervert.

44
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,291
What?

45
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,458
Stop groping me, you pervert!

46
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,125
The pervert is following us, Grandma.

47
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,125
My house is this way.

48
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,083
Shall I push?

49
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,000
No.

50
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,375
Born this way.

51
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,000
What about our walk, Grandma?

52
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:32,125
We're giving up walks for a while.

53
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,333
I don't want to.

54
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,416
Tough. You can't have everything your way.

55
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,333
Do you always take walks at this hour?

56
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,916
I thought it'd be safer
and we wouldn't be seen.

57
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,125
But the world is full of scary beasts.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,875
Here we are.

59
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,333
I'll be going.

60
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,875
Come on in.

61
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,375
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

62
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,041
Oh, drat.

63
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,000
Would octopus dumplings do?

64
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,958
We're out of rice.

65
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,458
That's fine.

66
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,833
Not you again.

67
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I keep putting him out but he returns.

68
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:46,625
Don't touch it, Kumiko. It may have fleas.

69
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,541
Scat!

70
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,250
Just here for some free food.

71
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you feed him often?

72
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:55,541
I meant you.

73
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,916
No, he's not a friend. Just a pervert.

74
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:04,375
He understands you.

75
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,833
Of course not. Are you stupid?

76
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,375
"You're intruding on my territory."

77
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,541
That's what he said.

78
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,166
Ms. Kumiko…

79
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,416
Josee.

80
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,583
What?

81
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,458
I'm not Kumiko. I'm Josee.

82
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,875
Josee?

83
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,541
With thanks.

84
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,291
Have seconds.

85
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:48,458
Thank you. I can't afford
to buy another box lunch.

86
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,500
You sound very poor. Are you a student?

87
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, I rent an apartment nearby.

88
00:07:55,583 --> 00:08:00,208
I'm poor, but I'm also trying
to save money.

89
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,833
Nobody's asking.

90
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,125
I'm thirsty, Grandma.

91
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,125
Barley tea or water?

92
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,875
-Barley tea.
-Okay.

93
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,041
Just a second.

94
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,666
Allow me.

95
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,583
It's okay. Don't let your food get cold.

96
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,166
Is this it?

97
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,250
Here.

98
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,875
You're pretty demanding.

99
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,416
Ouch, that's hot!

100
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,541
What's the deal?

101
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:37,000
Kumiko can't hold onto tea in a cup.

102
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,750
How about a plastic bottle? Or a thermos.

103
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,375
You're a funny young man.

104
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,958
Thank you for the meal.

105
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,125
Sorry for staying so long.

106
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,416
Nonsense. We don't often have guests.

107
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,333
Goodbye.

108
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,083
Do you want to earn some money?

109
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,250
<i>A new job?</i>

110
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,791
Yeah, someone I happened to meet.

111
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,458
It pays really well.

112
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,833
What about this job?

113
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,750
I'll continue, of course.

114
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,625
Where's the joy in working so much?

115
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:21,500
I can introduce you too. She's a female.

116
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,041
-Seriously?
-Yes.

117
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,916
About 80 years old.

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,166
Figures.

119
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,000
Move those hands, Hayato.

120
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,166
Yes, boss.

121
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,916
Have you seen the toolbox?

122
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,458
Yeah, the lid needed fixing.

123
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,416
Hey, thanks!

124
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:46,041
I might even hire you full-time
when you graduate.

125
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,833
I'll think about it.

126
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,750
Not you. I meant Tsuneo Suzukawa here.

127
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,708
I plan to study abroad after college.

128
00:09:55,791 --> 00:10:00,500
Didn't you know, boss?
He's going to the Netherlands.

129
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,833
It's Mexico.

130
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:06,708
Ah, Mexico. I once swam
with a baby sea lion in La Paz.

131
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,458
Study abroad, huh?
We're going to miss you.

132
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,791
I haven't found a school yet.

133
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:19,958
And he hasn't saved enough.
You should raise his wages.

134
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,583
Mine too, while you're at it.

135
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,458
Go check the machines.

136
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,916
Right away, sir!

137
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,000
What's wrong, Mai?

138
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:33,291
Nothing. Well, tell me
about that job that pays so well.

139
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,916
You are to do as Kumiko says.

140
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:37,708
What?

141
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,583
Didn't I tell you?

142
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:44,000
No, you didn't.
You mean I'd be working here?

143
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,708
Yes, you'd be working here.

144
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,958
Don't look so disappointed.

145
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:56,583
There's only one rule.
Don't take her out on your own.

146
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,708
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.

147
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,833
There's plenty.

148
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,000
I have to go.
Kumiko will tell you what to do.

149
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,125
Where are you going?

150
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,083
Well… hello.

151
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,875
What do I do?

152
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,375
Joan, was it?

153
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,333
It's Josee!

154
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,708
-Josee?
-Stay away.

155
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,250
"Intruders get out", he says.

156
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,125
But I'm working here from today.

157
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,958
-Kneel.
-What?

158
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,500
On your knees.

159
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,041
Okay, I'm kneeling.

160
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,625
Do you want to live?

161
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,875
Why am I kneeling?

162
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,041
To see how long a human can endure it.

163
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,791
Do your job well.

164
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,083
I'm going to make her cry.

165
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:20,000
Your look has really changed
in the past month.

166
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,333
Is working for this Josee that hard?

167
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,500
It's way beyond hard.

168
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,583
Count the meshes in the tatami mats.

169
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,083
It keeps me up at night wondering.

170
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,583
5,208, 5,209, 5,210,

171
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,166
5,211, 5,212…

172
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,583
Oh, what a waste.

173
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,916
I squandered 8,000 yen
on a bad pachinko machine.

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,416
8,001, 8,002, 8,003… Oops.

175
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,958
Start over.

176
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,375
Bring me four-leaf clovers.

177
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,375
Four-leaf clovers.

178
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,625
Four-leaf clovers…

179
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,916
Here.

180
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,458
Nothing's happening.

181
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,708
Ten are supposed to grant my wish.

182
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,833
Superstition.

183
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,750
What wish?

184
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,166
Don't speak to me. I'm busy.

185
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,291
She looks so meek

186
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,291
until she speaks
and becomes a stinging jellyfish.

187
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,416
I'd like to glue her
to one of her sliding doors.

188
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,958
Oh, harsh.

189
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:39,833
Why don't you quit?
You need to write your thesis.

190
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,208
But I really need the money.

191
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,000
You don't have to earn it there.

192
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,458
Even if your hours
at the shop are decreasing.

193
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,833
Stop thinking about making a buck

194
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:56,000
and give some attention to Mai.

195
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,250
Eat this and shut up.

196
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,583
Is Tsuneo here?

197
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,125
Professor!

198
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,666
There you are. Can you spare a second?

199
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,250
<i>Your essay on Turing Patterns.</i>

200
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:18,166
I sent it to a professor
at Mexico City University.

201
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,166
He loved it and wants you to study there.

202
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,458
Thank you!

203
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,500
That leaves the question of a scholarship.

204
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,083
It'll be hard to pay your own way.

205
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,375
I'll study Spanish harder,

206
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,916
and rewrite my research proposal.

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Okay, don't push yourself too hard.

208
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,750
You'll need your health.

209
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,208
Otherwise, all will be lost.

210
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,416
Okay.

211
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,541
I thought you were asleep.

212
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,083
Grandma, can we resume our walks?

213
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,041
No.

214
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,875
What if you get pushed again?

215
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,791
Can you protect yourself?

216
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,625
Listen to me. The world…

217
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,375
-is full of scary beasts.
-Is full of scary beasts.

218
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,458
Yes, I know that.

219
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,250
Then be content to stay home.

220
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,375
I envy you. Free to go where you choose.

221
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,958
Nothing will happen from waiting.

222
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,750
Hello!

223
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:42,375
I'll miss the money, but Hayato is right.

224
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,875
Listen, I've come to a decision.

225
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,500
I need to quit this job.

226
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:00,791
Are you listening?

227
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,625
Kumiko!

228
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,250
Kumiko!

229
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,875
What's wrong?

230
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,000
Kumiko is missing!

231
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,083
Stop!

232
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,875
What are you doing?

233
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,208
None of your business!

234
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,291
Let me go!

235
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,166
What, by yourself?

236
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,291
-Let's call it a day.
-Take me.

237
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,958
Take me to the sea.

238
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,166
Or I'll say you
groped my breasts and get you fired.

239
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,291
Do what you want. I'm going home.

240
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,458
This will cost extra.

241
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,750
280 yen.

242
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,250
For the ticket. I've got a railcard.

243
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,500
Is something wrong?

244
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,125
No, it's nothing.

245
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,916
It's Tsuneo. I've found Kumiko.

246
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,500
Excuse me.

247
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:39,166
I'll have her back
as soon as I can. Please understand.

248
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,916
-Tiger.
-What?

249
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:46,875
Tigers everywhere.

250
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,166
Tigers?

251
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,833
Hey.

252
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,958
Where to now?

253
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,875
Home.

254
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,375
What about the sea?

255
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,500
You were so insistent.

256
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,500
Watch where you're going!

257
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,208
What? She bumped into me.

258
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,416
Are you serious? What a jerk.

259
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,958
Hey, watch it!!

260
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:14,875
Yes, Granny.

261
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:18,041
Mess with me and I'll rip out your heart

262
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,208
and feed it to you!

263
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,041
Sorry!

264
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,208
What do you want to do, Ms. Josee?

265
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,708
Are we going or not?

266
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,375
Be careful.

267
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,458
Not there?

268
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,875
No, it's this way.

269
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,125
Really?

270
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,791
Now, where's the elevator?

271
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,375
Why are there so many people?

272
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,791
Beats me.

273
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:14,416
It's not my first time on a train.

274
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,875
Stop staring.

275
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:22,458
No, I was just wondering
how you see the world.

276
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:27,166
Forests, deserts, New York, Paris…

277
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,041
I've never imagined them that way.

278
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,958
The way you drew them.

279
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,166
You went into my room?

280
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,666
I'd like to see an ocean like that.

281
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,541
Pretty cocky for a servant.

282
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,458
A servant?

283
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,541
From today, you're "My Servant."

284
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,708
What is that?

285
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:54,750
Look! An airplane!

286
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:58,416
Really? Where? Point it out to me.

287
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,000
It's like a dream.

288
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,000
Give it up. It's sand.

289
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:57,500
You okay?

290
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,500
Take it easy.

291
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,666
Hey!

292
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,500
I need an answer.

293
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:15,916
My dad once asked me,
"How does the sea taste?"

294
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:22,458
When I was a child,
he took me to the ocean.

295
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,625
But the waves were too scary to get near.

296
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:33,166
My dad died without
ever telling me the answer to it.

297
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:40,458
Of course, I learned
from books that the sea is salty.

298
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:45,083
But this may be
my only chance to confirm it.

299
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,250
What are you doing?

300
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,291
Put me down, you pervert!

301
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,625
You want to see for yourself?

302
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:15,958
Salty.

303
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,208
It really is salty!

304
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,291
Why is it so salty?

305
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,208
I'm happy for you.

306
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:28,958
Hey, stay still!

307
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,666
It's really salty!

308
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,458
Stop!

309
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,041
NO GOING OUT!

310
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,416
You said you'd come right back.

311
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,916
{\an8}Do it again, and you'll lose this.

312
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:01,500
{\an8}Sorry.

313
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,083
Why did you come with me?

314
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:18,833
I have a weakness
for anyone longing for the sea.

315
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,833
I love seeing schools of fish swimming,

316
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,208
so I often go diving.

317
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:28,333
I even work at a diving shop.

318
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,333
You've swum underwater?

319
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:33,125
Alongside real fish?

320
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:34,750
Yeah.

321
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,333
Wow.

322
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:43,708
Tell me, are there
other places you want to go?

323
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,958
Grandma takes a nap between one and three.

324
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:30,750
First crepe ever?

325
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:35,208
No, I've eaten many with my boyfriends.

326
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,041
I'm popular with boys.

327
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,708
I've had five boyfriends at once.

328
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,666
Sure.

329
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,250
Ready and…

330
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,041
You okay?

331
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,250
So many different blues!

332
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,625
Let's ride that!

333
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,250
No, wait!

334
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:14,375
Hurry up!

335
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:18,166
This is amazing! Where's my house?

336
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,250
Osaka Castle? Tell me, My Servant.

337
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,458
Afraid of heights?

338
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:43,083
There.

339
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:47,000
Guess what, Grandma. I made dinner.

340
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,041
You what?

341
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,250
Yukichi, come here.

342
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,083
Yukichi?

343
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,208
Yeah, I named him.

344
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,166
Well, you can't!

345
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,750
-Make this chair two millimeters higher.
-What?

346
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,458
That wasn't bad.

347
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,750
Like I told you.

348
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,125
Stop that!

349
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,583
Easy.

350
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,583
Slow down!

351
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,125
We're in the sea.

352
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,875
A seal!

353
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,375
California sea lion.

354
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,041
It's got horns.

355
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,250
It's a Naso unicornis.

356
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,125
Look at the big one!

357
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:47,291
Whale shark.

358
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,125
What's that group?

359
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,250
Horse mackerel.

360
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:53,000
One type sticks to reefs,

361
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,333
but another type swims in the open seas.

362
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:59,166
The latter form unique schools

363
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,875
at middle to low ocean depths.

364
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,291
They differ in shape, color, and habitat.

365
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,458
Gold and black mackerel stick to reefs.

366
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,750
Rockfish take to the open sea.

367
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:29,291
It's a job opportunity for Kumiko.

368
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,125
You're as pesky as the rest.

369
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,875
She must be able
to live an independent life.

370
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,750
You're supposed to support, not lecture.

371
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,541
I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

372
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:47,041
Keeping her confined to the home

373
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,625
is not in her best interests.

374
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:54,666
I'd bet her departed parents
are worried too.

375
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,208
What do you know?

376
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:01,583
I refuse to take Kumiko outside.

377
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,458
But she goes out a lot lately.

378
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,375
She thinks I don't know.

379
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,500
By herself?

380
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,916
I honestly didn't think
he'd take her to places.

381
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,500
I was flabbergasted.

382
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,208
You'd be surprised if you saw her now.

383
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:27,875
She looks like that Glico billboard.

384
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:28,791
Sorry?

385
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,583
Ready to take off at a sprint.

386
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,291
<i>MACARTHUR'S ASSASSIN</i>
<i>RED SEA</i>

387
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:43,916
It's a sea of books.

388
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,458
"Josee"?

389
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:04,583
Oh, it's you, My Servant.

390
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,916
Does that say "Josee"?

391
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,875
It's the main character's name.

392
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,166
Francoise Sagan.

393
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,500
That's the sequel to this one,

394
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,583
the conclusion I've longed to read.

395
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,041
Hmm, it'll put me to sleep.

396
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,208
I wouldn't expect a boorish servant

397
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,458
to understand Sagan.

398
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,750
Go borrow these.

399
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,916
We need a library card.

400
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,750
<i>LOST PROFILE</i>

401
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,875
First time?

402
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,708
Please fill out this form.

403
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,041
Do you like Sagan?

404
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:00,916
So do I!

405
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,833
Which is your favorite?

406
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,333
Sorry, I never meet other Sagan fans.

407
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:10,708
I got a little excited.

408
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,083
<i>Those Without Shadows.</i>

409
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:18,416
Cool.

410
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,583
Have you read <i>The Unmade Bed</i>?
The protagonist is Beatrice

411
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,791
-from <i>Those Without Shadows</i>.
-Josee, borrow them both.

412
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,166
Boyfriend?

413
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,750
He called you "Josee." How wonderful.

414
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:35,958
No! He's not my boyfriend or anything!

415
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,750
She wouldn't waste time on me.

416
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,041
Boys like her.

417
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,375
She had five boyfriends at once.

418
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:45,541
Shut up. I'll beat you senseless.

419
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:52,291
But I'd like to read
the book you were mentioning.

420
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:53,875
Yes, about Beatrice.

421
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,833
You made a friend.

422
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,333
A friend?

423
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,125
The librarian.

424
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,041
Kana and I are already friends?

425
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,833
It looked like it to me.

426
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,500
<i>Kana and I are the same age.</i>

427
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,958
How old is that?

428
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:19,958
Twenty-four.

429
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,250
What? You're older…

430
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:26,958
I mean, wow.
So you and Kana are the same age?

431
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:29,750
It must be amazing to talk

432
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,833
to a lot of people every day.

433
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:35,250
You get used to it.

434
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,958
I meet lots of customers
at the diving shop.

435
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,541
Really?

436
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,291
-Hey, it's Tsuneo…
-Hey.

437
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:54,333
You must be Josee.

438
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:59,791
Perfect strike.

439
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:04,208
Hi, I'm Tsuneo's oldest
and dearest friend,

440
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,458
Hayato Matsuura.

441
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,750
What social media do you use?

442
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:09,000
Easy, Hayato.

443
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,208
I don't have one.

444
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:18,083
She's a fairy. Living in analog!

445
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,000
Knock it off.

446
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,458
What'll we do?

447
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,791
Sorry, I'll be right back.

448
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,208
Welcome, ladies. Come in.

449
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,083
You don't have to worry about him.

450
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,583
Welcome. This way.

451
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:33,500
Please take a seat.

452
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,500
Tsuneo, you're here.

453
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,250
Just passing by.

454
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,041
How can I help you today?

455
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:49,208
We want to get our diving licenses.

456
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,166
I see.

457
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,458
How do you do? I'm Mai Ninomiya.

458
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:55,625
Tsuneo's told me a lot about you.

459
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,916
If there's anything you need, please ask.

460
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:08,291
Oh, yesterday I saw a clown frogfish!

461
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,833
You took the photo yourself?

462
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,708
No, the strong swell kept interfering.

463
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:16,291
I want to leave.

464
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,333
We just got here.

465
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,458
Josee?

466
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:23,625
Sorry.

467
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,625
Did Josee leave already?

468
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:31,625
What a rare beauty.

469
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:35,125
Pale skin, modest, cute, and delicate…

470
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,458
Get back to work.

471
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,250
What's wrong?

472
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,958
Nothing!

473
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:44,375
You wanted to see where I work.

474
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,041
I don't like places like this.

475
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,041
Places like this?

476
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,500
I don't know what there is to hate.

477
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:58,541
You wouldn't!

478
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,583
That's right. I don't!

479
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,416
No, thanks.

480
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,125
But alone, you…

481
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,958
<i>Tell him not to come anymore.</i>

482
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:29,791
What happened?

483
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,750
Just tell him.

484
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,208
All right, I will.

485
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,958
I'm a mess, Yukichi.

486
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,458
I don't have to come?

487
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:53,916
I understand.

488
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:03,208
No, I don't understand!

489
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,333
Like that? I'm really proud of it.

490
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,916
This here…

491
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,291
Sorry.

492
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:28,416
What is it?

493
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:34,916
I've been granted
a scholarship to study abroad!

494
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,708
That's great! When do you go?

495
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,208
Next March.

496
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:42,875
School starts in September,

497
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:47,125
but they want me to come after I graduate.

498
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:52,000
I guess we'll only have
six more months working together.

499
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:58,916
<i>You've been coming alone lately.</i>

500
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:00,708
Where's Tsuneo?

501
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,250
Who cares about that dunderhead?

502
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:07,208
Dunderhead?

503
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:10,708
{\an8}He's useless and takes up a lot of space.

504
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,083
{\an8}He eats like he's starving
and flirts with girls.

505
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:15,333
{\an8}JAPANESE NOVELS

506
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,500
{\an8}What's so funny?

507
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:20,208
{\an8}Sorry, but you're just so obvious.

508
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,458
{\an8}What's obvious?

509
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,666
{\an8}Kana!

510
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,125
Hi, Rio!

511
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:27,875
Read this.

512
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,458
{\an8}What's wrong?

513
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:34,708
{\an8}I always read to kids at this time of day.

514
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:38,208
But a worker just quit on us.

515
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,833
Anyone here?

516
00:39:39,916 --> 00:39:40,750
Coming!

517
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:42,291
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,250
Will you read to us?

519
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:58,125
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

520
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,000
This lady is going to read to us!

521
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:06,416
I don't think I can…

522
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,541
Hurry and read.

523
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:09,000
-Hurry.
-We're waiting.

524
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,541
-Keep reading.
-Please.

525
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,250
-What's wrong?
-Come on.

526
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,416
"On the bed of a limpid,

527
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,041
blue sea stood a pearl palace,

528
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:24,333
where six princess mermaids lived."

529
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:29,791
"They loved to listen
to the king tell stories

530
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:34,625
about the world they'd see
above the waves as adults."

531
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:37,625
"The sky, birds,
exotic things, city lights."

532
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:41,625
"The princesses waited
with eager anticipation

533
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,375
for that day to come."

534
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,541
"'Farewell, good prince,'

535
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,583
the mermaid said, tossing her knife."

536
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:51,500
"And she dove into the sea,

537
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:55,375
where her body melted away into bubbles."

538
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,958
I can't read stories very well.

539
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,375
Question!

540
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,583
What did her palace look like?

541
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:24,625
Look, the mermaid palace!

542
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:28,708
It really looks like a mermaid home.

543
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:32,916
Josee, you're an illustrator?

544
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,333
No way!

545
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:37,208
What a shame it would be

546
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:40,083
for people not to see your art.

547
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:44,125
I think you should
put together a collection

548
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:45,875
and get them published!

549
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:46,791
I can't!

550
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,541
Sorry.

551
00:41:58,125 --> 00:41:58,958
Good evening.

552
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,958
Go home! No dunderheads allowed!

553
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,125
What are you doing?

554
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:21,791
It's pretty good, right?

555
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,875
You made it, My Servant?

556
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,375
Yes, Your Servant made it.

557
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,375
No wonder it's so ugly.

558
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,958
What's it called?

559
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:37,833
It's a clarion angel.

560
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,291
A rare species found only near Mexico.

561
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:48,458
<i>When I was a kid,
my local fish store had one,</i>

562
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,416
<i>and I fell in love with it.</i>

563
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:55,833
<i>I'd go to look at it
every day after school.</i>

564
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,250
<i>When I learned it swam in schools,</i>

565
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,625
<i>my interest grew more.</i>

566
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,291
<i>It wants to be with family too.</i>

567
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,458
<i>What do you mean?</i>

568
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,875
<i>My parents are divorced.</i>

569
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:16,125
Dad left home, and Mom
was always busy working.

570
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:21,666
I don't think he was sad,
though, the clarion angel.

571
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,333
He had you come every day.

572
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,833
I've long dreamed
of seeing him swimming in a school.

573
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:36,583
It's why I've studied so hard
and saved money.

574
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,083
They're hard to find

575
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:42,166
so a brief diving vacation wouldn't do.

576
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,583
It's a nice dream.

577
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,375
I hope it comes true.

578
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,791
Actually, next year…

579
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,333
This is defective.

580
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:00,708
That's odd.

581
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,416
There, all fixed.

582
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:23,791
That hurts!

583
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:26,416
Why the heck did you do that?

584
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:47,375
Hello!

585
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:55,833
Ready to go?

586
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,333
Kumiko!

587
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:09,291
Grandma, the world isn't all scary.

588
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,791
I'm going to have nightmares.

589
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,208
Nightmares? You came to see this.

590
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:57,791
I wanted to see
the scariest thing here with you.

591
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,208
I thought I could do it
with you by my side.

592
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:04,833
With me by your side?

593
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,958
To hold onto.

594
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:20,083
I needed something
to hold onto if I got scared.

595
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,583
That hurts.

596
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:35,125
I read a story aloud
to children the other day.

597
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:37,083
You, Josee? What was it?

598
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,958
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

599
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,000
Wow, that's amazing.

600
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,416
I didn't read it very well.

601
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:47,708
I got so nervous, I couldn't look up.

602
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:50,583
It was scary.

603
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,500
But then I drew a picture,

604
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,166
and the children all loved it.

605
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,000
I want to draw more.

606
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:03,500
More?

607
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,291
As a job. I want to draw professionally.

608
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:10,833
I want to give it a shot.

609
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:12,958
Like what you're doing.

610
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:18,166
Well, I love…

611
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:20,125
your drawings.

612
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,250
Pretty cocky for a servant.

613
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:30,500
Cherry blossoms fall
like rain here in spring.

614
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,125
My dad used to bring me.

615
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:35,833
It must be beautiful.

616
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:41,083
If you want to see it,
you can bring me next year.

617
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:44,416
What's wrong?

618
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:47,708
Nothing.

619
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:23,750
<i>Did you hear about Ms. Yamamura?</i>

620
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:27,166
<i>She's had a bad heart for some time.</i>

621
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:30,166
<i>And she was quite old.</i>

622
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,250
CHIZU YAMAMURA

623
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,375
The morticians left.

624
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:47,958
If you need to talk, I'm here.

625
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,666
About what to do next.

626
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:58,125
Grandma left me a little money to live on.

627
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,708
I'll be okay for a while.

628
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,000
I see.

629
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:07,083
But I can't afford to pay.

630
00:49:09,083 --> 00:49:12,416
I can't pay My Servant wages.

631
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:18,250
I understand.

632
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,750
{\an8}OUT OF OXYGEN

633
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:38,208
It's rare for you
to lose track of oxygen, Tsuneo.

634
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,333
You seem distracted.

635
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,750
I know. You confessed--

636
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,166
Josee's grandmother died.

637
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:52,916
So now she's all alone.

638
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,458
That's pretty harsh.

639
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:57,958
And worrying.

640
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,583
She's not a child,

641
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,625
and there are welfare services
and facilities.

642
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,541
"Free yourself from life."

643
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,208
"From that which others call life."

644
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,791
"Be free from emotion,

645
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,041
from one's strengths,
one's own weaknesses."

646
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:24,791
"Be but one momentary breath,

647
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:28,708
one-millionth of a billion nebulas."

648
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,041
Are you home, Ms. Kumiko? It's Mizushima.

649
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:45,041
This is Mr. Fujita, a social worker.

650
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,750
The resident's association chairman
got a call from one of your neighbors.

651
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:55,000
They heard your grandmother passed

652
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:57,083
and felt you needed assistance.

653
00:51:58,458 --> 00:51:59,666
It's none of their business.

654
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,291
How do you plan to move forward?

655
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,833
Pictures.

656
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:12,083
I plan to draw pictures.

657
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:19,708
You're saying you'll earn
a living as an artist?

658
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:23,958
I think it's wonderful to have a dream.

659
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:28,291
Dreams are one thing. Reality is another.

660
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,916
You of all should know that.

661
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,625
Don't be foolish. Go look for work…

662
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,041
Your grandma's not here to dote on you.

663
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,708
Mr. Fujita.

664
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:47,125
Or is there someone else
who will support you?

665
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,750
Are you okay?

666
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:14,791
I'm Mai. We met the other day.

667
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,583
Why are you here?

668
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:23,250
I remembered Tsuneo saying
you lived by the river.

669
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:29,166
It would've been faster
if we had just asked Tsuneo.

670
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:34,041
What do you want?

671
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:41,916
I beg you to free Tsuneo.

672
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,208
Wait, we came to cheer her up!

673
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:48,416
He's worked so hard for his dream.

674
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,916
Studying Spanish, working to save money

675
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:55,041
so he can study abroad.

676
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:56,458
Study abroad?

677
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:00,625
Next March, he's going to Mexico.

678
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:03,583
He didn't tell you?

679
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,958
Would you support his dream?

680
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:09,625
At this rate--

681
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:12,125
Why do you have to ask my permission?

682
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:16,208
What's your relationship with him?

683
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,291
It's sympathy.

684
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,500
Tsuneo only visits you
out of pity for your condition.

685
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:36,750
What the hell are you saying?

686
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:38,791
Don't listen to her.

687
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,166
Hey, wait up!

688
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
What types of cytoplasm do I mean?

689
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,041
That's right, cytoplasmic genomes.

690
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:53,708
You can consider them
a place to store genomes.

691
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,541
<i>THE LITTLE MERMAID</i>

692
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:09,958
Hello.

693
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:20,750
Josee, I brought fish-shaped cakes.

694
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,541
Why did you come?

695
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:28,750
Josee?

696
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:31,500
Your room…

697
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:37,791
I asked a helper to come
and clean the place once a month.

698
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:39,625
And your pictures?

699
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:40,541
Thrown out.

700
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:41,833
What? Why?

701
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:44,416
None of your business.

702
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,416
If that's all, you can go.

703
00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:03,791
I'll fix it right away.

704
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,458
I want to go to the sea.

705
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,958
This will be your last job as My Servant.

706
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,333
Up to the waterline?

707
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,750
This is fine.

708
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,125
How about a warm drink?

709
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:06,458
No thanks.

710
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:19,416
It's salty.

711
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,208
Josee.

712
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:34,833
I don't want money.
Don't call this the last job.

713
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:36,458
Josee!

714
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:39,416
I'm no longer Josee.

715
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,333
I've taken a job in an office.

716
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,958
You didn't need to get rid of your art.

717
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:49,750
It was out of reach.

718
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:52,708
Everything's always out of reach.

719
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:56,166
The red balloon caught on the roof.

720
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:58,916
The cicada husk on the tree.

721
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:02,750
Walking under an umbrella in the rain.

722
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,958
Climbing the steps of a shrine.

723
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:08,125
All of it.

724
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:13,458
I no longer wish to reach for any of it.

725
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:19,458
If you really don't,
then why do you look so sad?

726
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:23,166
Don't give up what you love!

727
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,125
You're leaving soon, right?

728
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,708
The healthy wouldn't understand.

729
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,125
Josee!

730
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:19,000
Josee!

731
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:39,458
My Servant…

732
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:42,041
My Servant.

733
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:45,833
My Servant!

734
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,083
My Servant!

735
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:54,375
Tsuneo!

736
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,416
Are you all right?

737
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:07,916
There's been a traffic accident!

738
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:19,125
<i>-Remove the scoop.
-Yes.</i>

739
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:20,166
<i>Cutting away clothes.</i>

740
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,250
Pulse 120, BP 70 over 40, saturation 94%.

741
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,333
Maintain ten liters of oxygen.

742
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:27,750
<i>-Peripheral off?
-Not yet.</i>

743
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,875
Quickly, 18-gauge, full throttle.

744
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:33,875
<i>-Crossmatch. Don't forget the blood gas.
-Got it.</i>

745
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:35,500
<i>X-ray standby!</i>

746
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:38,083
Airways clear, respiration's steady.

747
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:39,833
<i>Starting echo.</i>

748
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:41,458
<i>Negative. Pneumothorax is fine.</i>

749
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:43,541
Mr. Suzukawa?

750
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:47,375
<i>Mr. Tsuneo Suzukawa? Can you hear me?</i>

751
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:50,708
<i>If you can hear me, open your eyes.</i>

752
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:14,541
Are you awake?

753
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,791
Yes.

754
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,666
You were in a traffic accident.
This is a hospital.

755
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,375
I'll call the doctor.

756
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,833
The girl in the wheelchair?

757
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:31,458
Oh, yes, we asked her to go home today.

758
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:34,625
She insisted on waiting till you awoke.

759
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,291
So she's not injured?

760
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,208
No.

761
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,625
How do you feel?

762
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,250
I was in an accident?

763
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:48,083
You suffered a concussion,

764
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:50,625
but tests showed nothing was wrong.

765
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,083
Your internal organs are sound,

766
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:58,583
but your right shinbone
is broken at the ankle.

767
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:01,333
In short, an open fracture.

768
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:04,250
Emergency surgery was done

769
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:06,791
to prevent infection at the wound.

770
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:10,958
We secured the fracture
with screws and a plate.

771
01:02:11,583 --> 01:02:16,458
It'll take two months
before it can bear your weight.

772
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,250
Two months.

773
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,333
One more thing.

774
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:26,083
Surgery couldn't unite
the joint surfaces perfectly.

775
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:28,583
There's a risk of osteoarthritis.

776
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,458
Osteoarthritis?

777
01:02:32,541 --> 01:02:37,083
You could experience
joint pain and stiffness,

778
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:40,166
making it hard to walk or run like before.

779
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:44,083
The hairline fracture in your left arm

780
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:48,416
may make crutches moot for a while.

781
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:51,958
Will I heal?

782
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,875
<i>It's hard to say at this stage.</i>

783
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:12,666
Josee.

784
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:14,875
I'm sorry.

785
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:19,625
It's not your fault.

786
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,875
I seem to be in pretty bad shape.

787
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:28,625
Even rehab might not fix everything.

788
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,083
If it turns out I can't walk again, I…

789
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:44,125
I need to sleep.

790
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,000
Quiet!

791
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,875
You don't need to come, Mom.

792
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:20,958
You'll hurt your back.

793
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,500
It's no big deal, I swear.

794
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:29,250
I'll come visit
after I leave the hospital. See you.

795
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:33,333
Professor.

796
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,416
How are you, Tsuneo?

797
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,458
I'm sorry to worry you.

798
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,916
Listen, about your study abroad.

799
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:49,791
They'd like another student

800
01:04:49,875 --> 01:04:52,375
to come in March if you can't.

801
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:57,916
It's a pity,
but you'll get another chance.

802
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:01,916
For now, just focus on getting well.

803
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,666
That's not the problem.

804
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,916
It's possible I may not
be able to dive anymore.

805
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:20,125
If I can't do that,
I'll lose my reason for going abroad.

806
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:34,000
{\an8}<i>SPANISH GRAMMAR</i>

807
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,750
So rotate your ankle

808
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:08,083
and extend your toes
to the extent possible.

809
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,541
When the swelling goes down,

810
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:15,291
we can shift to your rehabilitation.

811
01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:18,791
Tsuneo.

812
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:21,833
I bought pudding.

813
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:24,708
Thanks.

814
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,708
Starting rehab already?

815
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:30,750
Yeah.

816
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:33,333
I'll put this in the fridge.

817
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:40,000
My parents keep sending
rice and vegetables.

818
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,416
My fridge is bulging.

819
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,250
{\an8}<i>SPANISH GRAMMAR</i>

820
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,875
Want to get some fresh air?

821
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,625
Feel free to say what's on your mind.

822
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,625
I'm here to give you my support.

823
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:17,875
It doesn't matter anymore…
Studying abroad, Mexico.

824
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:23,541
I thought I was stronger than this.

825
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,541
Please don't give up.

826
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,041
Work hard on rehab--

827
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,833
"Work hard"? What if it doesn't matter?

828
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:35,958
I didn't understand anything.

829
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:41,083
How scary it is
to reach for something I want.

830
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:50,083
I…

831
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,083
have feelings for you, Tsuneo!

832
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:54,750
I just didn't want that

833
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,875
to get in the way of your goals.

834
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,333
But I can't help it.

835
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,375
I'm madly in love with you!

836
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,750
How'd this happen?

837
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,625
Mai, listen. I--

838
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:18,833
I know.

839
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,958
I don't need a "Sorry" or a "Thanks."

840
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:26,916
I hate women who cry in front of men.

841
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,666
But…

842
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,458
I needed to say it.

843
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,250
We should get back.

844
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,291
I know you're there! Answer the door!

845
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,375
If you don't…

846
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:18,291
Go away!

847
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:21,375
Don't come back.

848
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:26,833
Tsuneo's given up on studying abroad.

849
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:30,666
So now I'm making him mine.

850
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:35,791
I'll give him the love
he needs to forget the sea.

851
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:40,666
I never wanted him to go to Mexico.

852
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,541
I prayed he'd forget his silly dream

853
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:49,750
and stay near me.
I wanted to be by his side.

854
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,166
I know him so much better than you.

855
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:59,583
His love for talking about fish,
the awful way he hums.

856
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,333
He's bad at rock-paper-scissors.

857
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:06,958
He likes pudding, hates cucumbers,

858
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:09,791
and always has ice-cold hands.

859
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,916
I could name a hundred more things.

860
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,708
I know him far better.

861
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,916
Well, say something!

862
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:25,833
My Servant's never giving up.

863
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:30,708
He'll never forget
about fish or abandon his dream!

864
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:32,458
That's who he is!

865
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,041
You know that, right?

866
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:40,666
I can't name a hundred things about him.

867
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,291
But you can't beat my feelings for him.

868
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:49,875
If that's true, then show it!

869
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:06,333
Salty.

870
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,250
You're clumsy.

871
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,416
I'm a good woman.

872
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:29,291
Why don't you buy me dinner then?

873
01:11:29,375 --> 01:11:30,208
What?

874
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,000
Josee.

875
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,083
I have a request.

876
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:26,916
You should let the characters
show more emotions.

877
01:12:27,583 --> 01:12:29,041
Say how they feel.

878
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:30,791
I see.

879
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,208
Hey, redhead.

880
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:11,250
Josee?

881
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:13,875
Lend me your face.

882
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,125
What?

883
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:19,416
<i>LOST PROFILE</i>

884
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:24,916
I desired nothing but my escape from him.

885
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:26,833
That is all.

886
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:32,125
Upon reflection,
it was truly a pitiful story.

887
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:41,708
It's done.

888
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:43,125
Ta-da.

889
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,083
What's this?

890
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:50,750
Isn't it obvious? Permission to leave.

891
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,791
No, why do you have it?

892
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:56,208
I just figured you might seek

893
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:58,916
a change of pace once in a while.

894
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,166
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood.

895
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:08,500
Don't be such a bore, Tsuneo.
Let's have some fun!

896
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:09,750
Leave me alone!

897
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:19,791
As your diving buddy,
it's my job to give you oxygen…

898
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:25,708
whenever you need it.
So shut up and follow me.

899
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:34,166
What's going on?

900
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:35,333
Don't ask questions.

901
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,125
This place.

902

{\an8}<i>THE MERMAID AND THE SHINY WING</i>

903
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,166
<i>The Mermaid and the Shiny Wing.</i>

904
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:21,208
From the floor of the deep blue sea,

905
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:23,500
festive music is heard.

906
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:26,750
It's a mermaid's 20th birthday

907
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:30,083
when she can leave the sea.

908
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:35,833
You're doing fine.

909
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:47,833
The mermaid received
a magic shell as a gift.

910
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:50,333
And it spoke to her.

911
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:53,916
"You can use me to turn human,

912
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,833
and back into a mermaid again."

913
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,666
"But you must not wish for anything else."

914
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:03,166
"For if you do,

915
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:07,250
you'll turn to froth and vanish forever."

916
01:16:08,833 --> 01:16:12,666
"I understand,"
said the mermaid and swam ashore.

917
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:17,208
"Oh, shell, turn me into a human."

918
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:22,416
Suddenly, her fins became graceful legs.

919
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:27,416
"How wonderful,"
she exclaimed as she climbed a hill.

920
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,583
But the world outside was full of danger.

921
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:36,416
A ferocious tiger appeared before her.

922
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:40,083
The mermaid tried to run

923
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,250
but lost her footing and fell.

924
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:48,583
Clinging to a rock, she yelled, "Help!"

925
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:54,125
Just then, a young man
with pure white wings

926
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:56,916
descended from the sky to help.

927
01:16:57,916 --> 01:17:00,125
"Thank you. Those are lovely wings."

928
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:04,250
The young man
beamed happily at those words.

929
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:08,791
"When spring comes,
I'm taking flight with them."

930
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:11,916
For he had a dream.

931
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:18,416
It was to fly
to a shiny sea far, far away.

932
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:23,041
A place where a family
of bright orange fish swam.

933
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:25,916
A vast sea, full of fun and frolic.

934
01:17:27,416 --> 01:17:31,458
The two became friends
and went to many places together.

935
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:36,375
<i>"Every place makes my heart
dance with such joy,</i>

936
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,041
<i>I feel like skipping."</i>

937
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:42,333
<i>The mermaid saw her world grow and expand.</i>

938
01:17:43,791 --> 01:17:46,375
The seasons changed and spring arrived.

939
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:51,083
The day for
the young man's departure came.

940
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:56,583
The mermaid was sad
and walked alone in the woods.

941
01:17:57,458 --> 01:18:01,708
Again, a ferocious tiger
appeared before her.

942
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:06,291
Claws sharp, fangs bared,
it pounced on the mermaid.

943
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:09,208
"Look out," cried the young man,

944
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:12,000
appearing just in time to save her.

945
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:15,708
But this time, he was injured,

946
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:18,875
his gorgeous wings, broken.

947
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,458
Sobbing with grief,

948
01:18:22,958 --> 01:18:26,458
the mermaid took
the magic shell in her hands

949
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:30,541
and wished, "Please save him."

950
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:35,250
Within seconds, his wounds healed

951
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:37,541
and the youth awoke alive and well,

952
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:41,666
but his wings would never return.

953
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:48,458
"I can no longer reach
the shiny sea," he lamented.

954
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,833
The mermaid said, "Raise your head."

955
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:55,333
"You have larger wings in your heart."

956
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,250
<i>"With those wings, you sheltered me</i>

957
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,708
<i>and used them to push me forward."</i>

958
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:07,708
"With wings of the heart,
you can fly anywhere."

959
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:12,875
The young man set off
for the shiny sea by boat.

960
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,625
In driving rain or stormy winds,

961
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,791
he pushed ever forward.

962
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:23,541
"I'm not afraid
for I'm in pursuit of my dreams."

963
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:30,291
His heart wings were
strong, supple, and beautiful.

964
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,166
And most of all, unbreakable.

965
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,750
At last, he found the shiny sea.

966
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:39,708
With great joy, he dove into it.

967
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:44,083
He started swimming freely
with the orange fish,

968
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:48,458
so happy that his dream came true.

969
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:53,916
{\an8}"Oh, shell, you can now
turn me into bubbles."

970
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:59,416
But her legs turned back into fins

971
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,041
and nothing else occurred.

972
01:20:03,416 --> 01:20:05,000
The magic shell spoke.

973
01:20:06,041 --> 01:20:07,333
"Wishing for another's benefit

974
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:12,083
and not your own
will never make you vanish."

975
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:19,791
So with a heart filled
with shiny jewels of memories,

976
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:23,166
the mermaid returned to the deep blue sea.

977
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:25,541
The end.

978
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:14,708
Why are you hiding?

979
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:24,041
Look, I think he can make it!

980
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:42,458
-You did it!
-You did it!

981
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:56,833
Yukichi, My Servant walked today.

982
01:23:00,458 --> 01:23:02,500
Stray cats must not get spoiled.

983
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:11,833
Must not get spoiled.

984
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,333
Fight the tiger yourself.

985
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:21,458
<i>I'm getting out!</i>

986
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:26,208
I just need to make weekly visits.

987
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,708
That's great. Congrats!

988
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:32,958
Thanks.

989
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:38,000
I'm not sure about the side effects yet,

990
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:42,041
but I'm going to Mexico no matter what.

991
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:46,125
Now that I've got heart wings.

992
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:52,125
You'll be fine.

993
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:58,791
They're letting me leave on the 24th.

994
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:02,333
Can you come get me?

995
01:24:02,916 --> 01:24:03,875
10 a.m.

996
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,583
Josee?

997
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:14,625
I'm just so happy.

998
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:17,416
Thank you.

999
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:43,416
Josee?

1000
01:25:58,416 --> 01:25:59,375
Josee!

1001
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:23,541
Josee.

1002
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,083
Here.

1003
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:32,083
Ms. Kana!

1004
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:35,250
Tsuneo, congrats on getting out.

1005
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:37,041
Where's Josee?

1006
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,750
I haven't seen her today.

1007
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:41,833
Sorry.

1008
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,541
You're so right.

1009
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:48,500
Big trouble! Josee's missing!

1010
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:19,208
A girl in a wheelchair just boarded.

1011
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:22,750
<i>Do you know where to?</i>

1012
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:21,666
<i>Attention, guests.</i>

1013
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:25,750
<i>The zoo will be closing in a few minutes.</i>

1014
01:28:26,666 --> 01:28:32,583
<i>Please make sure you have
all your belongings with you.</i>

1015
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:32,500
<i>Josee.</i>

1016
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:50,000
Stop!

1017
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,125
Sorry!

1018
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:12,041
Josee!

1019
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,041
That hurts.

1020
01:30:29,833 --> 01:30:32,125
You all right, Josee?

1021
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:34,916
Are you okay yourself?

1022
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:39,875
Your leg.

1023
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:42,416
You just got out.

1024
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:47,958
In my panic to find you,
I found myself running.

1025
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:50,125
Why?

1026
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,875
I've decided to try to become

1027
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,875
a picture book illustrator.

1028
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,916
I plan to stand on my own two feet.

1029
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:09,666
{\an8}You've pushed me
from behind for long enough.

1030
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:10,791
It's not for you.

1031
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:14,666
It wasn't for you.

1032
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:18,250
I want to be Your Servant.

1033
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:23,541
What about the clarion angel?

1034
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:26,083
And going to Mexico?

1035
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:28,625
I'll still go, but…

1036
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:31,166
I love you, Josee!

1037
01:31:40,291 --> 01:31:41,125
I…

1038
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:44,041
I…

1039
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:49,208
love you too, My Servant.

1040
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:19,333
It's not at all like I imagined.

1041
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:23,333
What? In a bad way?

1042
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,166
In a good way.

1043
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:19,375
-Pretty, right?
-Yes.

1044
01:37:24,166 --> 01:37:25,875
It's really a cherry blossom rain.

1045
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:33,708
Did you die?

1046
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:35,250
What?

1047
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:36,625
Are you a ghost?

1048
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:39,125
I'm home for spring break.

1049
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:40,291
You didn't tell me!

1050
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:43,375
I wanted to surprise you.

1051
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:48,666
Pretty cocky for a servant.
