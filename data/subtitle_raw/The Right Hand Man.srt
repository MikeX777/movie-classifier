1
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,350
Good boy, come on.

2
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:19,621
Come on.

3
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:20,645
Good, good.

4
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,416
Come on.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,441
Whoa, stand.

6
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,754
There's a girl.

7
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,029
Good boy, good.

8
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,009
Steady, girl. (Horse neighs)

9
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,469
Come on!

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,494
Let's go!

11
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,623
Before they all get
out there and spread it.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,353
Thank you, Father.

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,688
This is a splendid present.

14
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:51,676
(clock ticks) (gentle music)

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,704
Now.

16
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,480
(dramatic music)

17
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:12,047
(man shouts)

18
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:14,740
(wagon rattles)

19
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,494
(chugging music)

20
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,640
Just like flying.

21
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,520
(dramatic music)

22
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,093
(man groans)

23
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,745
(wagon rattles)

24
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,357
(glass shatters)

25
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:13,924
(ducks honk)

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,721
(men chatter)

27
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:23,243
[Townsman] Whoa,
whoa, whoa, steady.

28
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:24,578
Steady there, whoa!

29
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,563
(people chattering)

30
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,505
- What should we do?
- My father.

31
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,841
- You've cut your arm.
- Is he all right?

32
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,134
- [Townswoman]
- He's only cut his arm.

33
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,969
- [Townswoman]
- What about his father?

34
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,638
Someone should fetch the doctor.

35
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,931
- No, he's all right.
- Where's my father?

36
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,350
[Townswoman] They
say his neck is broken.

37
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,559
[Townsman] What
about his father?

38
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,810
[Townsman] The
bloody man was driving.

39
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,003
[Townsman] Rich and
dangerous, that's their trouble.

40
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,066
- Try rich and stupid.
- It's my birthday.

41
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,901
Happy birthday.

42
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,278
(chickens cluck)

43
00:02:58,302 --> 00:02:59,404
Yes?

44
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:00,763
There's been an accident.

45
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,057
[Woman] How bad?

46
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,018
Very bad, Your Ladyship.

47
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,872
My son?

48
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,856
He's not badly hurt.

49
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,067
My husband?

50
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:18,489
(sombre, graceful music)

51
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,412
(thunder booms)

52
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:35,441
(rain patters) (sombre music)

53
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,845
(clock ticks)

54
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,788
Why do I not recover?

55
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,101
(thunder booms)

56
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,603
The arm's infected.

57
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,146
I'll unwrap it and
change the bandages.

58
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,147
Then we'll see
what's to be done.

59
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,714
Get off, get out!

60
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:01,717
Go away!

61
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,973
A little attention to
cleanliness would help.

62
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,731
(thunder rumbles)

63
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,873
[Harry] Are they
talking in the town?

64
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,334
Yes, they talk.

65
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,191
They wonder how such a
thing could have happened

66
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,466
to such a fine reinsman.

67
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,177
I've wondered the
same thing myself.

68
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,100
There, is that better?

69
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,122
Where's Mother?

70
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,355
She should read to me.

71
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,692
I should think
the mating fence.

72
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,841
(fire sizzles)

73
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,134
The mating fence.

74
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:09,618
The never-ending fences.

75
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,557
Why hasn't he recovered?

76
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,665
What I...(sigh)

77
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:17,770
His father was the same.

78
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,397
The least cut would
suppurate, leave a scar.

79
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,398
I know that.

80
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,233
And then there's the climate.

81
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,799
So many factors
could contribute.

82
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,027
Mumbo jumbo.

83
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,720
Might as well employ a witch.

84
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,032
He's not strong
enough. Not only in body,

85
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,516
but in mind, as well.

86
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,686
He's still too much of the boy.

87
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,398
You seem to manage very well.

88
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:42,026
[Woman] One thing I can't do.

89
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:45,297
What's that?

90
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,405
I cannot sire an heir.

91
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,093
You have an
heir, he's upstairs.

92
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:51,118
Useless!

93
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,062
(hooves squish)

94
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,273
(children shout)

95
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,983
Jonathan, get off that table!

96
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,902
[Man] Matthew!

97
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,844
(children chatter)

98
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,431
Quiet!

99
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,410
Get off that table.

100
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,328
[Townsman] Would you
come here this minute?

101
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,829
- [Townswoman]
- Give me that pillow!

102
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:18,706
Get over here.

103
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,191
[Townsman] Get down
from there, come on.

104
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:24,753
(person coughs)

105
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,633
(children giggle)
(person coughs)

106
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,076
(door slams)

107
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,125
Well?

108
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,712
Is it to do with his
wasting disease?

109
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,465
Perhaps.

110
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,658
Now, this won't hurt a bit.

111
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,726
(people chattering)

112
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,646
White gangrene
has set into his wound.

113
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,295
Michelangelo
couldn't do it better.

114
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,320
Where's he live?

115
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,531
So quickly?

116
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,593
The two must be connected.

117
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:16,495
Where, in the swamp, does he?

118
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,975
They may be, but
I need more proof.

119
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,019
Sometimes, Sarah, you
jump too quickly to conclusions.

120
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,044
Does he?

121
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:27,631
Did you tell him
what must happen?

122
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,903
No, I couldn't
bring myself to.

123
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:32,904
Can I go?

124
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:34,698
Then I'll tell him.

125
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,116
I'd prefer that.

126
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,951
- I know.
- Can I?

127
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,618
Yes!

128
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:39,685
Here.

129
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,819
(person coughing)

130
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:53,699
(townspeople chattering)

131
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,512
(children teasing)

132
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:58,704
[Townsman] Matthew!

133
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,641
Matthew!

134
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,374
(townspeople chattering)

135
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:22,037
Your mother
said to tidy you up.

136
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,413
Take off your boots, damn you.

137
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,897
You're making the floor shake.

138
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,609
(dish rattles)

139
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,862
Tidy the room and
leave me alone.

140
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,996
(sombre music)

141
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:59,240
Every movement hurts it.

142
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:01,892
(sombre music)

143
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,897
It can be stopped.

144
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:13,737
By cutting it off?

145
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,451
I've stolen your thunder,

146
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,163
and I know very well
how much you hate that.

147
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,402
The horses, who'll
exercise the horses?

148
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:37,469
I won't be able.

149
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,037
When?

150
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,062
Tomorrow.

151
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:51,483
No.

152
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:53,485
Do it now.

153
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,798
I'm not frightened.

154
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,133
I'm glad.

155
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,158
Glad?

156
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,177
Oh, Harry.

157
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:02,202
My father.

158
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:05,164
It was my fault.

159
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,791
It wasn't an accident.

160
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,127
I fainted, I lost control.

161
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,963
Harry, it wasn't your fault.

162
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:19,279
But sometimes, sometimes

163
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,513
I can't convince myself
that it was just an accident.

164
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,228
Because I don't believe there
are such things as accidents.

165
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,688
Harry.

166
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:32,960
Harry.

167
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,527
(tender music)

168
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,896
How can you bear to do that?

169
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,713
I just close my
eyes and pretend.

170
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:58,735
Pretend that you
are still pretty.

171
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,887
(tender, soft music)

172
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,022
This faintness, has
it happened before?

173
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:15,734
(sombre music)

174
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,781
(saw grinds)

175
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:10,289
(bone snaps)

176
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,680
I'm sorry.

177
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:30,475
Don't be.

178
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,205
Perhaps now he
won't be able to do

179
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:35,814
the things that exhaust him.

180
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,151
Cricket,

181
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,547
horses,

182
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,572
hunting,

183
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,117
the foolish racing.

184
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,078
Now, if you'll excuse me.

185
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,837
(Harry screams)

186
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,845
(hooves thunder)
(dramatic music)

187
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,265
(wagon rattles)

188
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,644
(percussive music)

189
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,052
Get up, get up!

190
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,520
(hooves thunder)

191
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:10,510
Get up, let's go!

192
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,537
(people chattering)

193
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,773
Get up, let's go!

194
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,800
(people chattering)

195
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,038
(people laugh)

196
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,331
[Passenger] Say,
are you all right?

197
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,458
(people laugh)

198
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:45,235
(people chatter)

199
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,342
(hooves clomp)

200
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,262
(percussive music)

201
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,388
Get up!

202
00:15:55,412 --> 00:16:00,417
(wagon rattles)
(percussive music)

203
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:12,239
Get up!

204
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:17,267
(wagon rattles)
(percussive music)

205
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:24,125
(people chattering)

206
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,127
[Townsman] Come to
the church on Sunday.

207
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,546
[Child] Move it, I
want to get through here.

208
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,531
(people chattering)

209
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,138
[Townsman] Ah, let's go.

210
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,222
(people chattering)

211
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:39,289
Harry.

212
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:44,521
Harry.

213
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,731
(children chattering)

214
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,358
How's it all going, eh?

215
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:50,776
(people chattering)

216
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,529
[Townswoman] Hello,
Mr. Laney, how nice to see you.

217
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:58,558
(children shouting)
(people chattering)

218
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,187
[Townsman] Hear
the word of the Lord!

219
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,900
(children chattering)

220
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,008
Don't be stupid, Harry.

221
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:16,219
These people have
memories like elephants.

222
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,929
Even if you could cope,
it would be madness

223
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,287
to be seen driving here.

224
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,625
Harry, Sam will drive.

225
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,193
- [Townswoman] Here, Mrs.
- Row, let me help you with that.

226
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,694
How long are you staying?

227
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:36,346
(wagon creaks)

228
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,567
Jesus, man, will
you watch the road?

229
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:50,546
Mother, the man's an oaf.

230
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,297
He can't handle
horses of this calibre.

231
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:55,049
I thought he was
doing rather nicely

232
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,509
now he's cut down their food.

233
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,094
No, I only cut down their feed

234
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,303
so that he could handle them.

235
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,430
This is no way to treat horses!

236
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:02,391
It's only a temporary solution.

237
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,058
I won't have them
worked like this.

238
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,142
Perhaps we ought to sell them

239
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,127
before they lose
condition completely.

240
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,426
Don't fiddle.

241
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,763
That girl gets a lot of post.

242
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,492
She sends for things.

243
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,244
[Mother] Does she?

244
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,269
Yes.

245
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,647
I suppose this means
a stop on the way home.

246
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,376
Yes.

247
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,985
(wagon creaks)

248
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,758
Mother.

249
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:38,783
Yes, Harry?

250
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:42,888
Her father wants a
sample of my urine.

251
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,182
I'm sure he has good reason.

252
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:48,394
(chuckles) He wants
to taste it. (Chuckles)

253
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,586
How extreme.

254
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,463
Shall you let him?

255
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,153
Harry.

256
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,237
What?

257
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,615
Self-pity is never attractive.

258
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,266
(wagon creaks)

259
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,151
Pass the butter.

260
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,763
You're not eating.

261
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,829
[Harry] No.

262
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,933
You should.

263
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:29,334
Well, obviously I should.

264
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,688
The food is disgusting.

265
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,398
[Mother] I know that.

266
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,216
Nevertheless, you
ought to make the effort.

267
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,176
[Harry] I know.

268
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,013
Hey.

269
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,767
It seems, Harry, we
have reached an impasse.

270
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:55,878
Mother, I think I found
the right man for my horses.

271
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:56,903
Please, Harry!

272
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,674
I would appreciate it
if, just for a moment,

273
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,342
you could think, talk,
about something else

274
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,701
other than your horses!

275
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:10,208
We need a maid, Harry,
housekeeper, butler,

276
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,503
a cook or two, a footman.

277
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:17,006
Gold, it's like a disease.

278
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,820
Well, you never know
what might turn up.

279
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,279
Well, I do know, Harry.

280
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,615
That's the discouraging part.

281
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:27,076
They come, they go,
they drink, they fight,

282
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,245
they frighten the horses.

283
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,062
In short, Harry,
it's not like home.

284
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,086
At least your father
talked about it,

285
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,278
which was a comfort.

286
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,701
(sighs) Damn it, Harry.
Why do you think I do it?

287
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,764
Why do you think I
struggle so to make

288
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:50,123
something out of nothing?

289
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,543
You enjoy it, Mother.

290
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,481
That's hardly
the word I'd use.

291
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:00,759
Oh, what is the word?

292
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,928
One day, I'll tell you.

293
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,433
[Harry] You
confuse me, Mother.

294
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,371
(sighs) I know.

295
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,939
(gentle music)

296
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:27,052
(people chattering)
(people singing)

297
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:30,264
♪ Life is but a dream ♪

298
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:35,293
(people chattering)
(people singing)

299
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,902
(man chuckles)

300
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:47,931
(people chattering)
(people singing)

301
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:01,778
I came here to talk to you.

302
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:04,864
I need someone.

303
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,220
Someone I won't want to throttle

304
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,995
every time I see his
hands on the reins.

305
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:16,084
I think you love horses,

306
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,629
and you drive

307
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,674
as I would myself.

308
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,948
To do so, I would give you
twice your present wages,

309
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,366
board and lodging
into the bargain,

310
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,951
and a team second to none.

311
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,786
- No.
- As many men

312
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,352
as you want to work under you.

313
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,748
You'd be a fool to refuse me.

314
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:40,960
(man laughs)

315
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,235
The Leviathan's finished.

316
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,340
The steam train will
replace it within the year.

317
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,367
(people chattering)

318
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,165
So um,

319
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,146
what do you think?

320
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,714
I told you, no.

321
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:09,113
Why?

322
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:13,975
Well, sir, my lord, this
way, I'm my own master.

323
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:18,455
[Harry] Oh, really?

324
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:21,208
Well, to the extent
that any working man is.

325
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:23,168
I do my job, and
they leave me alone.

326
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:24,004
From what I've heard about you,

327
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,796
it wouldn't be like that.

328
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,238
I'd be at your beck and call.

329
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,259
Or at your mother's
beck and call.

330
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,385
I don't wanna be owned.

331
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,386
Well, you wouldn't be owned.

332
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,054
You'd just have the
best team on the road.

333
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:34,890
Can't you see it?

334
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,181
[Ned] Yes, I
can see it, all right.

335
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:37,206
Well then.

336
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:45,065
Don't worry, I'd see you right.

337
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,775
I'd look after you.

338
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,427
I don't need you or your
job or any other bugger.

339
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,598
Oh, yes, you do.

340
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,101
You just don't know it yet.

341
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,063
Well, you make
me laugh, I'll say that.

342
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:04,609
Shall we have another?

343
00:24:05,985 --> 00:24:06,986
Why ever not?

344
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,716
(woman laughs)

345
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,593
(people chattering)

346
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,469
[Townsman] Rick says
he can't hold his liquor.

347
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,639
[Townsman] On the
count of three, one, two.

348
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,683
(people laugh)

349
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,602
See the bugger in the afternoon.

350
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,128
(men chatter)

351
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:30,468
(birds warbling)

352
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,948
My God.

353
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,786
I think we might pursue it.

354
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,602
[Sarah] What have
you been up to, Harry?

355
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:04,669
Nothing.

356
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:07,255
Just been drinking, that's all.

357
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,235
Harry, listen to me,
this was more than drink.

358
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,510
You must know that.

359
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:16,740
I'd not dismiss the drink
so lightly, if I were you.

360
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:18,158
I'm so thirsty.

361
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,183
I know.

362
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,020
But, first, you'll pass
water for Father.

363
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,874
I can't move.

364
00:25:25,898 --> 00:25:26,983
You won't have to.

365
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,552
(water gurgles)

366
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,556
(urine filling jar)

367
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,829
[Doctor] Reading
at the table, Sarah.

368
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,980
Your mother would
never permit it.

369
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,857
I know.

370
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,859
Just as well she's dead.

371
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,570
Sarah.

372
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,573
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere.

373
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,911
Really, I am. I don't
think sometimes.

374
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:25,893
You won't like to hear it,

375
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,168
but you're very like her, very.

376
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,297
Well, let's be glad
for that, then, shall we?

377
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,591
I am, every day.

378
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,582
There's no future in
the relationship, Sarah,

379
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:51,359
and you know it, no matter
how serious his intentions.

380
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,295
He hasn't spoken of it.

381
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,654
But he will, and then?

382
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,949
I love him.

383
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,011
[Doctor] I need
hardly point out

384
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,619
to you the consequences of that.

385
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,306
No.

386
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,432
For that woman to yearn
for an heir as she does

387
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:08,060
is, in my opinion,
selfish and wicked.

388
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,603
I love him.

389
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,628
That will pass.

390
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,923
I hope so.

391
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,927
I hope for that more than
anything else in this world.

392
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:23,641
(gentle music)

393
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,855
It's so sweet.

394
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,503
So we're agreed
about the diagnosis?

395
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,113
(gentle music)

396
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,901
(people chattering)

397
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,090
[Child] Hey, come on!

398
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:03,300
Yay!

399
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,327
(children shouting)

400
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:14,168
(people chattering)

401
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,023
[Driver] Come on, hop down.

402
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,942
(people chattering)

403
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,487
[Child] Please, take
me to Sydney with you.

404
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,322
Get down.

405
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:27,515
(children chattering)

406
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:38,001
(horn honks)

407
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:40,545
Get up there, come on, yah!

408
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:43,030
(horn honks)

409
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,492
(wagon rattles)

410
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,544
(children shouting)
(horn honking)

411
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,973
(birds tweet)

412
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:12,995
(horn honks)

413
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,604
(hooves clomp)

414
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,530
(wagon rattles)

415
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:33,831
(hooves clomp)

416
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,554
(dramatic music)

417
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,828
Get up!

418
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,246
Do the horn, Ray.

419
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,123
(horn honks)

420
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,165
Get off the road!

421
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,417
- [Man On Horse]
- Pull over, you idiot!

422
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,985
(tense music)

423
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,050
Get off the road, you madman!

424
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,576
(tense music)

425
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,497
You (indistinct).

426
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:16,850
Keep it straight, lads!

427
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,377
(tense music)

428
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,316
Watch your heads.

429
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,276
(tense music)

430
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,070
(glass shatters)

431
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,490
(tense, dramatic music)

432
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:35,118
Get up, get up!

433
00:31:35,142 --> 00:31:38,372
Pull over, you idiot, pull over!

434
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,498
Get up, get up!

435
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,233
(exciting music)

436
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,955
Steady, now, steady.

437
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:59,083
Steady, now, whoa, steady.

438
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,672
(chickens cluck)

439
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,426
(dramatic music)

440
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,096
Now come here!

441
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,849
Wait till I get you home
and I tell your father.

442
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,226
(people chattering)

443
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,519
Come back here!

444
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,546
(people chattering)

445
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,947
(horn honks)

446
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,282
Steady.

447
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,808
(train chugs)

448
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,270
(horn honks)

449
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,002
(children shouting)

450
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,760
Good morning, Scott.

451
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,639
[Passenger] Who's
in charge here?

452
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,996
- [Passenger] What happened?
- What the hell happened?

453
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,165
Why don't you listen to me?

454
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,416
Why don't you ask
me what happened?

455
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,043
No one seems to
be congratulating us

456
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,586
for keeping this bloody
thing on its wheels

457
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,004
or the horses on their feet!

458
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,214
Anyone else driving
and you would have had

459
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,674
a proper accident on your hands.

460
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:56,468
[Passenger] The driver
must take responsibility.

461
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,118
It was reckless
driving in the extreme.

462
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,930
[Passenger] You're lucky
you didn't lose any lives.

463
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,181
(people chattering)

464
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,307
And as for that idiot.

465
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,267
If he brings any action,

466
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,601
then the bloody company
can answer for me,

467
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,394
but I'm not leaving a
forwarding address.

468
00:34:06,418 --> 00:34:08,063
- You wanna keep this job?
- I'm saving you the trouble.

469
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,232
Damn your job and
damn the company!

470
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,300
(people chattering)

471
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,071
The Leviathan's finished!

472
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,405
The steam train will
replace it in a year!

473
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,474
(people chattering)

474
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,647
(horn honks)

475
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,547
(hounds bark)

476
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,382
[Hunter] Tally ho!

477
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,907
(hounds bark)

478
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:50,254
(sheep bleat) (birds tweet)

479
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,792
(Ned knocks)

480
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:11,817
Come.

481
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,162
Yes?

482
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:26,457
I'm the coachman, if you-

483
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,293
- [Harry] Huh?

484
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,398
If you remember, my Lord.

485
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:36,133
Oh, yes, I remember,
on the Leviathan, as I recall.

486
00:35:36,925 --> 00:35:38,445
Is that it?

487
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,470
Not any longer.

488
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,973
Oh, why is that?

489
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,828
Well, it's a long story.

490
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:49,789
(Harry laughs)

491
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:52,792
Ned, I don't need your story.

492
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:55,378
It's enough to have you here.

493
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:56,921
I'm overjoyed to see you,

494
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:58,882
and I'll make you glad
of it, too. See if I won't.

495
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,907
Come on!

496
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,678
I haven't agreed
to anything yet.

497
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:06,288
Sam, Sam!

498
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:11,227
Ah, there you are,
fetch the horses.

499
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:14,004
(chickens cluck)

500
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,303
(water roars)

501
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,816
(hounds bay)

502
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,254
Ah, here they are.

503
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:40,757
Look at them, they're
a perfect match.

504
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,907
They were my father's.

505
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,826
This is Nightingale.

506
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:46,304
Come here, come here, come here.

507
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:48,973
- She's very free.
- And difficult.

508
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:50,642
I find her perfectly
manageable.

509
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,686
Using a lot of tact, that is.

510
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,711
That's Apollo.

511
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:56,731
He was injured
during my accident,

512
00:36:56,755 --> 00:36:58,191
and I was too ill
to look after him.

513
00:36:58,215 --> 00:37:00,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

514
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,236
Easy there.

515
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,779
We should get them
out as soon as possible,

516
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,281
assess his condition, and, well,

517
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:07,325
I'll leave it
entirely up to you,

518
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:08,559
should you take the job.

519
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,520
There is one more thing.

520
00:37:19,486 --> 00:37:22,239
(graceful music)

521
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,101
It's a cobweb.

522
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,603
(graceful music)

523
00:37:35,627 --> 00:37:36,962
A cobweb on wheels.

524
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,276
(laughs) I knew it.

525
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,069
I knew you were my man.

526
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,762
(horn honks)

527
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,141
(hunters chatter)

528
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:01,880
Hello, Mother.

529
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,007
Perhaps you'd like to have
a word with Mr. Devine.

530
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,258
He's our new coachman.

531
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,450
Not now, Harry.

532
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,764
We expect our servants
to take baths, Mr. Devine,

533
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,806
once a fortnight.

534
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,433
Did Harry tell you that?

535
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,102
All over, not just
the extremities.

536
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:19,296
(hunters chattering)

537
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,777
Shall we go up to the house?

538
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,070
I'd like to finalise
our arrangement.

539
00:38:26,094 --> 00:38:27,095
Is it agreed?

540
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:29,991
It is.

541
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:33,101
(hunters chattering)

542
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,148
One more, Sam.

543
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,630
[Hunter] Hear, hear.

544
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,740
(hunters chattering)

545
00:39:06,468 --> 00:39:08,321
(wagon rattles)

546
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:11,056
(exciting music)

547
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,815
See?

548
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,191
It's just like flying.

549
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,968
(exciting music)

550
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,744
I'd like your opinion.

551
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:58,395
I'm trying to
tempt his appetite.

552
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,040
I don't know.

553
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:02,065
I certainly don't.

554
00:40:06,403 --> 00:40:08,590
Dare say you've found
a name for it by now.

555
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,591
Your father's been
hinting as much,

556
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,283
but the man can
spit nothing out.

557
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,120
Diabetes.

558
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:19,833
And is it fatal?

559
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,294
Often.

560
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,692
They say they're not
ready till you can eat

561
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,842
them with a spoon.

562
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:34,973
And it's in the blood?

563
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,184
We think so.

564
00:40:39,978 --> 00:40:41,605
Time does not exhaust it?

565
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,417
No.

566
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,194
(graceful music)

567
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,305
Go on, go on. Please, say yes!

568
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,598
Why?

569
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,166
Sarah must meet Ned,
and Ned must meet Sarah.

570
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,461
[Mother] He's
a servant, Harry.

571
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:07,464
Well, I know he's a
servant but just at the mo...

572
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,651
Listen, Mother, at the moment,

573
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,469
Ned and Sarah are the most
important people in my life.

574
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,198
Apart from you, of course.

575
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,532
And I wanna show
them off to each other,

576
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:17,951
and I need the carriage.

577
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,203
Surely, you don't
need it for just one day!

578
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,080
You exhaust me, Harry.

579
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,313
Please, say yes!

580
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:25,731
Yes.

581
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,614
(soft music)

582
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,493
He'll be home soon.

583
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:02,936
(soft music)

584
00:42:16,658 --> 00:42:17,927
Tomorrow morning, then.

585
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:20,370
(soft music)

586
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,181
My sleeve is empty,

587
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:46,396
but my hand, it reaches out,

588
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:48,690
touches you.

589
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,112
And you feel nothing.

590
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:57,824
(soft music)

591
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:09,753
How wrong you are.

592
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:13,632
(wagon rattles)

593
00:43:16,593 --> 00:43:17,594
Get up, Busy, come on.

594
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,894
(laughing)

595
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:31,399
Come on, ready.

596
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,923
Ready?

597
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,948
Come on.

598
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:42,619
Ready.

599
00:43:45,038 --> 00:43:46,039
Right.

600
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:54,857
(ball thumps)

601
00:43:54,881 --> 00:43:57,759
I've been practising. (Chuckles)

602
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,641
What are you thinking?

603
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,707
I'm thinking it's worth taking

604
00:44:11,731 --> 00:44:13,358
a good deal of
care in this life.

605
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:18,238
Not to get shot at or maimed.

606
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:21,658
Or hanged.

607
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:35,714
[Mother] Have you no work?

608
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:40,988
Get up.

609
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,680
(wagon rattles)

610
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,560
I'm sorry, mother,
we were delayed.

611
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:50,830
Daisy threw a shoe.

612
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,748
[Mother] Daisy threw a shoe?

613
00:44:52,772 --> 00:44:53,666
She did.

614
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,376
Where, pray,
did Daisy throw it?

615
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,252
Over the windmill,
perhaps, over the moon?

616
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,087
Mother, I fear-

617
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,171
- Don't lie, Harry,
you're not good at it.

618
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,548
As you see, we have a visitor.

619
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,175
Oh, are you ill, Mother?

620
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,950
Not yet, Harry.

621
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,221
The doctor was, what
were you doing, Doctor?

622
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:08,431
Repaying the compliment.

623
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,831
May I put it like that?

624
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,185
You may put it how you like.

625
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,210
I must go.

626
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,359
What compliment?

627
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:21,278
The compliment
of your calls, Harry.

628
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,279
Those you've been paying him

629
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,137
in the afternoons
while he's out.

630
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,574
I see.

631
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,159
I'm glad of that, Harry.

632
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,702
It'll make my task
in pointing out to you

633
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,187
that these visits must
cease so much the simpler.

634
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:36,835
Wait!

635
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,629
You'll not be happy not
hear it, but there's more.

636
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,072
It seems, Harry,
the impetuous Sarah

637
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,844
has confided to her
father that she loves you.

638
00:45:46,868 --> 00:45:47,721
What?

639
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,038
Sarah has confided to
her father that she loves you.

640
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,268
Under the circumstances,
Harry, I find the pleasure

641
00:45:54,292 --> 00:45:57,087
you take in what I just told
you quite beside the point!

642
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,070
No. Under the
circumstances, Mother,

643
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,613
it is the only point.

644
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,531
Don't mimic me, Harry!

645
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:08,367
You aren't a parrot.

646
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,867
What you are is a fool!

647
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:12,245
Why, why a fool, because
I'm happy someone loves me?

648
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,913
I love her, too, Mother.

649
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,581
You grow more
foolish by the minute!

650
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:17,607
What is wrong with Sarah?

651
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:21,069
It is not what is
wrong with Sarah.

652
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:24,340
It is what is wrong with you.

653
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,175
What?

654
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,199
What is wrong?

655
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,536
(sombre music)

656
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,901
(Mother weeps)

657
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:45,510
My childhood illness?

658
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,848
I feel I'm over it.

659
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,853
Just lately, I've
never felt better.

660
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:57,522
My arm.

661
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,377
I'm practising, Mother,

662
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,297
I'm practising learning
to live without it.

663
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,381
You should see what I can do.

664
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,799
I'll show you.

665
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,824
Now I've got Ned, I...

666
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:11,595
(Mother weeps)

667
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:14,247
(solemn music)

668
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,007
Mother, please.

669
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:27,635
(crickets chirping)

670
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,852
(gentle music)

671
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:44,569
(woman sighs)

672
00:47:46,112 --> 00:47:48,907
I came here to talk to you,
because it seemed so silly.

673
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,844
I've talked to father about you

674
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,370
and your mother about you but,

675
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,373
never to you about you.

676
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,627
Harry.

677
00:48:03,129 --> 00:48:04,129
Harry!

678
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,884
I do.

679
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,511
Do what?

680
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:11,930
Love you.

681
00:48:13,014 --> 00:48:14,014
I do love you.

682
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,911
You're not listening, are you?

683
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,936
No.

684
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,748
Please, Sarah... No, you please.

685
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,065
Please listen!

686
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,714
If it's about my
mother, I don't,

687
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:29,924
my mother can go to hell.

688
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,634
She hates you, so
she can go to hell!

689
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,784
She's worried, Harry.

690
00:48:34,702 --> 00:48:37,038
No, she's,

691
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:39,935
desolate.

692
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,376
Desolate, I don't...

693
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,671
Sarah.

694
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:49,467
Sarah.

695
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,221
I love you so much,

696
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,348
but I'm afraid.

697
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,601
I'm afraid our talking
will spoil things.

698
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,105
Why do you say that?

699
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,190
You might say something

700
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:09,654
that you can't take back.

701
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:13,198
I see.

702
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,719
But I must.

703
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:17,263
(pot clatters)

704
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,681
I mean, do you
know what I think?

705
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:21,642
No, but I would like to.

706
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:23,960
All right, well I'll tell you.

707
00:49:29,757 --> 00:49:31,301
It is interesting, I suppose.

708
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,013
Interesting that you enjoy I,

709
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:37,450
talking behind my back.

710
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,976
Mother and you, you and Mother!

711
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,992
You're the two black
announcers at my death.

712
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,394
(crickets chirping)

713
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:08,129
(clock ticking)

714
00:50:11,132 --> 00:50:13,593
(eerie music)

715
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:36,717
[Man] Now.

716
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:39,452
(ominous music)

717
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:56,028
I wish we could run away.

718
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:58,721
I wish we could marry,
and live in a cave.

719
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:01,534
How did you get in?

720
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,559
I flew.

721
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,229
Round the roof, and
down the chimney.

722
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,816
(tender music)

723
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:37,218
This low, hectic
fever never leaves me.

724
00:51:39,637 --> 00:51:40,972
It's you, Sarah.

725
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:26,934
(gentle piano music)

726
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,333
(birds chirping)

727
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,387
(rooster crows)

728
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:59,068
(rooster crows)

729
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,729
(cockatoos squawking)

730
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:42,570
(hooves clopping)
(coach rattling)

731
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,299
Don't say it, Father,
don't say anything.

732
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,843
I wasn't going
to say anything.

733
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,472
Would you like some tea?

734
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,308
Yes, please.

735
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,313
But I do worry,

736
00:55:18,564 --> 00:55:19,565
in silence, that is.

737
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:21,734
You needn't.

738
00:55:23,027 --> 00:55:25,631
(hooves clopping)

739
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,656
I'm happy, Father.

740
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,802
I can't help it.

741
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,094
And should you help it?

742
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:32,119
Perhaps.

743
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,723
Because of Harry.

744
00:55:34,747 --> 00:55:35,891
Your happiness or otherwise

745
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,643
can't make any
difference to him.

746
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,186
There's nothing you can do.

747
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,479
But there is.

748
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,730
Just today, on the Leviathan,

749
00:55:41,754 --> 00:55:43,357
I'm expecting the latest
book on his condition-

750
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,776
- Sarah, it'll take more
than a book to cure Harry.

751
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,801
It's impossible.

752
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,613
I despise your
relentless pessimism.

753
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,013
I'm a realist, that's all.

754
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:53,617
I agree there are
things that may

755
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,601
aid his recovery
this time, but after.

756
00:55:58,771 --> 00:55:59,771
Anyway,

757
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:02,692
Harry's as much a
pessimist as you think I am.

758
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,238
For once, his
mother's powerless.

759
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,092
She's watching
her dreams crumble

760
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,927
with the death of
the Ironminster name.

761
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:15,514
How ridiculous
she is, so selfish.

762
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,349
[Father] Yes.

763
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,268
To mourn the death of a name.

764
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,502
Have you discussed
these things with Harry?

765
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:23,356
No.

766
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,620
Then how do you know that
Harry doesn't mourn with her?

767
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,407
I don't.

768
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:37,077
(people chattering)

769
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:38,269
- Hello.
- Hello.

770
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,280
Good.

771
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,076
That's very good, violet head.

772
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,588
They drove as
careful as they could.

773
00:57:06,839 --> 00:57:11,844
(coach rattling)
(hooves clopping)

774
00:57:24,982 --> 00:57:25,752
Steady.

775
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,569
(birds chirping)

776
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,917
It's my fault.

777
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,629
I shouldn't have sent for him.

778
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:49,900
He was for Harry.

779
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,903
I thought we could train
it to do things for him.

780
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:53,970
Be his right hand.

781
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,723
Well, it was a good idea.

782
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,767
But unkind.

783
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,498
Poor little thing.

784
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,332
Here, let me take him.

785
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,167
I'll bury him for you.

786
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,191
Oh no,

787
00:58:08,192 --> 00:58:09,360
I'll find a use for him.

788
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:15,258
Well, if there's
nothing I can do,

789
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,010
then I'll be getting back.

790
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:18,035
Ned?

791
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:19,744
Sarah?

792
00:58:21,288 --> 00:58:23,266
Do you mind working for Harry?

793
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,291
No, not Harry.

794
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:30,190
I was thinking, what with
the fly and everything,

795
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:32,508
seeing how it takes
his energy, well,

796
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,928
I thought that you
might resent it in a way.

797
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,490
And me with it.

798
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:39,515
No.

799
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:41,350
I'm grateful to you.

800
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,646
His only real pleasure
is what you do for him.

801
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:48,566
Well, then I'm glad.

802
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:50,670
(Sarah sighs)

803
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,797
And as for this, it
must remain our secret.

804
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,948
I won't have Harry
getting morbid over it.

805
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:01,829
(hooves clomp)

806
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,545
Steady, girls, walk.

807
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:12,214
Walk.

808
00:59:16,677 --> 00:59:17,678
Hold steady, girl.

809
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,059
You should marry Sarah.

810
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,413
No, I can't.

811
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,064
She loves you. Marry her.

812
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,544
No, her father's against it.

813
00:59:32,568 --> 00:59:33,569
Why?

814
00:59:34,695 --> 00:59:36,214
Well, he knows I
couldn't make her happy.

815
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:37,615
Well, her father's wrong.

816
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,802
She wants you, doesn't she?

817
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,429
So to have you
will make her happy.

818
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,097
It's a simple thing.

819
00:59:44,121 --> 00:59:45,122
Marry Sarah.

820
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,627
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

821
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:53,899
[Harry] You go and get
her and I'll hunt out Mother.

822
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,734
Get up.

823
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,426
(wagon rattles)

824
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:02,348
(birds cry)

825
01:00:20,282 --> 01:00:22,660
(Ned knocks)

826
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,648
[Sarah] Is it Harry?

827
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,798
There's nothing wrong?

828
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:38,151
No, nothing.

829
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:39,260
The opposite, in fact.

830
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:41,655
You're to come to the house.

831
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,139
- The house?
- Mm hmm.

832
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,767
Well, you are mysterious.

833
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,955
You won't tell me, will you?

834
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:50,980
Uh uh.

835
01:00:51,897 --> 01:00:53,440
Then I won't ask.

836
01:01:01,073 --> 01:01:02,283
It's marvellous, isn't it?

837
01:01:06,912 --> 01:01:08,831
It's been a wonderful
study for me.

838
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,936
This is very like
our own, you know?

839
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,546
(gentle music)

840
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,192
Well, I won't keep you waiting.

841
01:01:19,216 --> 01:01:20,217
No, I don't mind.

842
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:23,971
He'll keep.

843
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:26,408
It's wonderful.

844
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,034
I've never understood
Harry's passion for this,

845
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:29,852
but now I do.

846
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:31,979
Can we go faster?

847
01:01:33,689 --> 01:01:34,916
We can, but we won't.

848
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,543
The road's not good enough.

849
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,962
Well, can't we go somewhere
where we can go faster?

850
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,321
No, the horses are tired.

851
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:42,717
Oh.

852
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,677
(gentle music)

853
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:48,305
Sometimes it doesn't
hurt to stretch them a bit.

854
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,182
Get up!

855
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,874
(wagon rattles)

856
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,130
(dramatic music)

857
01:02:18,275 --> 01:02:19,526
Get up, get up!

858
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,381
Get up!

859
01:02:23,405 --> 01:02:26,158
(dramatic music)

860
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:29,972
Go!

861
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,456
(hand smacks)

862
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,861
Come on, Ned, tell me.

863
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:47,638
(Sarah chuckles)

864
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,770
I understand that you...

865
01:02:58,023 --> 01:02:59,400
Well, Ned said...

866
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:04,780
Well, he didn't say, but
he hinted of some surprise.

867
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,342
Harry?

868
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,176
Come, Sarah, not a surprise.

869
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,762
Surely you expected
this proposal?

870
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:11,787
Proposal?

871
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:14,415
There's been no proposal.

872
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:24,425
I'm sorry, I should've
asked you before I...

873
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:28,781
Ned said-

874
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,805
- Ned?

875
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:31,807
Yes, Ned.

876
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:34,829
He said-

877
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:38,164
- I have no desire to
know what Ned had to say.

878
01:03:38,188 --> 01:03:39,457
Wait, I-

879
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:41,001
- I have no desire to know
what anyone has to say.

880
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,111
Rather, I shall have my say,
and the subject will be closed.

881
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,215
You yourself told
me that any children

882
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:49,467
my son might have
would more than likely

883
01:03:49,491 --> 01:03:51,327
carry his disease in their turn.

884
01:03:52,244 --> 01:03:55,640
Now, Sarah, with your
outlook and upbringing,

885
01:03:55,664 --> 01:04:00,020
surely it is not your intention
to produce a sickly child.

886
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:02,564
You would take steps to
avoid this, would you not?

887
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:03,940
That is none of your business.

888
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:05,507
I'm making it my business.

889
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:09,279
Why, in these rather
dismal circumstances,

890
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,989
have you encouraged my
son to want to marry you?

891
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,556
I have not encouraged him.

892
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,580
But I do want to marry him.

893
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,832
Then I can take him to London,

894
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:24,127
where there's a man,
an expert on diabetes.

895
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:26,046
The function of
marriage, Sarah,

896
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,882
is not to further
medical research.

897
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,633
It is to produce children.

898
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:34,179
Sons to inherit and
carry on the line.

899
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,705
Marriage is something I
have longed for for Harry,

900
01:04:37,998 --> 01:04:39,333
but it cannot be.

901
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:50,427
(door slams)

902
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,033
Harry-

903
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,057
- Mother is right.

904
01:04:57,684 --> 01:04:58,769
She's right.

905
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:05,567
(door slams)

906
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:12,199
I want you to
take me home, Ned.

907
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:17,263
I would've thought Harry
would want to do that.

908
01:05:17,287 --> 01:05:18,807
Well, he doesn't.

909
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:20,225
What's happened?

910
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,542
There'll be no marriage.

911
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,256
And, Ned, you shouldn't
have suggested it.

912
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,527
It's embarrassed me.

913
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,927
Well, I didn't
mean to do that.

914
01:05:36,056 --> 01:05:37,492
I saw you leaving the
house one morning,

915
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,227
and, well, I just thought...

916
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:43,248
Well, you must've expected it.

917
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,041
Otherwise, you wouldn't have.

918
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:46,108
Wouldn't have?

919
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:48,067
Wouldn't have what?

920
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,239
I see.

921
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,470
Well, Ned, an
expectation of marriage

922
01:05:57,494 --> 01:05:59,121
played no part in my action.

923
01:06:00,372 --> 01:06:01,373
I love him.

924
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:04,018
I'll have the carriage
around the front of the house

925
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:04,937
directly, Miss Redbridge.

926
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,312
Thank you, Ned, but I
have changed my mind

927
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:07,647
and I will walk.

928
01:06:07,671 --> 01:06:10,424
(chickens cluck)

929
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:19,391
(peacocks cry)

930
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,313
I can't believe the hurt I feel.

931
01:06:26,231 --> 01:06:28,400
This marriage would
not have been perfect,

932
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:31,820
as a marriage between
us should've been.

933
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,971
It would've been
unnatural to avoid children.

934
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:41,139
'Tis not a matter
of unnaturalness.

935
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,724
It's a matter of common sense.

936
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:44,708
I don't have time
for common sense.

937
01:06:48,003 --> 01:06:49,046
And, Sarah,

938
01:06:50,422 --> 01:06:51,483
I've come to realise

939
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:56,512
that it is only through his
children a man goes on living.

940
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,328
Wait!

941
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,352
I will not.

942
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:05,562
I love you.

943
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:11,318
[Sarah] And love
conquers all, is that it?

944
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,570
I don't know.

945
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,073
It might.

946
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:19,284
Yes, it might.

947
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:24,831
(sombre music)

948
01:07:45,852 --> 01:07:48,355
(Harry sighs)

949
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,234
One by one, the stars go out,

950
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,073
and I'm left alone.

951
01:08:02,077 --> 01:08:04,079
You understand,
don't you, Father?

952
01:08:15,507 --> 01:08:18,260
(Harry splashes)

953
01:08:19,886 --> 01:08:22,389
(birds tweet)

954
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,953
Mother loves the world.

955
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,813
She's made a great
investment in it,

956
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:31,773
which dies with me.

957
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:34,168
Then don't die.

958
01:08:34,192 --> 01:08:35,712
So much of this is up to you.

959
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:36,737
It's inevitable.

960
01:08:37,946 --> 01:08:39,740
All death is inevitable.

961
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,409
Is that really
all you can say?

962
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:54,296
It is inevitable, but
it may be postponed.

963
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,634
And you're brave, Harry,
even strong in your way.

964
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,761
Don't, Doctor.

965
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,139
Your sudden good
opinion of me tires me.

966
01:09:06,558 --> 01:09:07,726
It all tires me.

967
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:10,646
That will pass.

968
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,190
This time.

969
01:09:14,691 --> 01:09:15,692
This time, yes.

970
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,005
And, after that, a few
simple precautions, that's all.

971
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:20,322
A meat diet, for example.

972
01:09:22,574 --> 01:09:27,579
You know. I've never really
cared for it much, this world.

973
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:33,168
Life is mother's
passion, not mine.

974
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:36,440
I know that, Harry.

975
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,465
I recognised it in you long ago.

976
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:41,486
Recognised it?

977
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,471
I recognise it, I do
not in the least admire it.

978
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:49,577
Over the years, I've
come to understand

979
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:54,606
that the man who despises
the world and all those in it

980
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:59,486
is likely to despise
himself even more.

981
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,968
And that this same
man, will do his best

982
01:10:05,992 --> 01:10:10,765
to make those that love
him as unhappy as he is.

983
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,042
(gentle, sombre music)

984
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,404
Sarah will visit
you this afternoon.

985
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:27,013
(Harry snorts)

986
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,518
Doctor.

987
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,541
Would you tell Mother
I'll join her for dinner?

988
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,000
You shouldn't.

989
01:10:38,024 --> 01:10:39,568
And ask Ned to come.

990
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:42,988
Would you?

991
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:51,246
Thank you.

992
01:10:53,498 --> 01:10:54,393
(water gurgles)

993
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:57,603
[Sarah] Sometimes, it's
so hard to think of death,

994
01:10:57,627 --> 01:10:59,147
the darkness of death.

995
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:01,274
Then don't, it's not natural.

996
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:02,984
A passion for
naturalness is something

997
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:04,509
that you and Harry both share.

998
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,139
I wouldn't know about that.

999
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:21,902
Do you like children, Ned?

1000
01:11:23,069 --> 01:11:24,696
Well, everyone likes children.

1001
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:50,490
Sometimes, I get a
little frightened of Harry.

1002
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:51,556
Oh.

1003
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,476
And, other times, I
need someone more.

1004
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:56,478
A friend.

1005
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:59,165
I was so glad when you came

1006
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:02,567
because I thought we might
be friends. The three of us.

1007
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:06,321
I can't be your
friend, I'm a servant.

1008
01:12:07,322 --> 01:12:08,323
I'm his servant.

1009
01:12:09,324 --> 01:12:11,117
Ned, it's all right.

1010
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,806
Ned, I'm sorry.

1011
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,206
It won't happen again.

1012
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:19,459
It won't happen again
because if's wrong.

1013
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:25,632
(insects chirrup)

1014
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:34,933
(clock ticks)

1015
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,776
Harry?

1016
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:49,406
Would you like to talk
about your horses?

1017
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,710
Do you miss Father?

1018
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:04,880
Yes, I do.

1019
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:11,219
That morning.

1020
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,392
We were going to
go faster than ever.

1021
01:13:19,227 --> 01:13:20,687
A race against time, he said.

1022
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,858
But we never did.

1023
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:32,073
I know this is complicated,
but it's come down to this.

1024
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:36,870
We never finished that race.

1025
01:13:39,247 --> 01:13:40,832
Ned is going to help me do it.

1026
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,669
That's what we were
talking about this afternoon.

1027
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:48,214
I suppose that's
why he came, really.

1028
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:50,759
You may not understand, Mother,

1029
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:58,099
but it'll be my own small stab
at this immortality of yours.

1030
01:14:02,103 --> 01:14:03,104
Not much, I know.

1031
01:14:05,732 --> 01:14:08,026
Certainly not what
you had in mind.

1032
01:14:11,988 --> 01:14:14,491
But, for the time
being, it's all I can do.

1033
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:24,501
(insects chirrup)

1034
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,462
Conditions are perfect.

1035
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:30,441
I rode the course
this afternoon.

1036
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:32,443
[Harry] Mm hmm.

1037
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:34,344
And the horses
will never be fitter.

1038
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,890
Neither, I dare
say, will I. (Chuckles)

1039
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:42,894
I thought you'd be pleased.

1040
01:14:44,145 --> 01:14:46,457
I am. I am, Ned.

1041
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:50,735
It's just, I'm
tired, that's all.

1042
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:54,656
Tomorrow morning, then.

1043
01:14:59,035 --> 01:15:02,181
Would you like the horses, Ned?

1044
01:15:02,205 --> 01:15:03,206
Hmm?

1045
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,961
They're more yours than
mine, really, aren't they?

1046
01:15:10,505 --> 01:15:13,275
I couldn't accept such
a gift, you know that.

1047
01:15:13,299 --> 01:15:14,509
No, I don't.

1048
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:17,780
Don't be so coy.

1049
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,264
Do you want the horses?

1050
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,020
Is there anything you need?

1051
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:27,272
Well.

1052
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,692
'Night, Ned.

1053
01:15:32,777 --> 01:15:33,945
Goodnight, Harry.

1054
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:40,535
(exciting music)

1055
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:59,572
Next time, we'll do it,
we'll have your time.

1056
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:02,348
(exciting music)

1057
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:11,608
(wagon rattles)

1058
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,861
Steady, steady, steady.

1059
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,282
Why did you do that?

1060
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:22,118
Because...

1061
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:28,917
Because it's meaningless.

1062
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:37,008
(thunder rumbles) (rain patters)

1063
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:43,324
Hello. We're not open yet.

1064
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:44,784
He says you're to come.

1065
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,952
He says it's time.

1066
01:16:46,976 --> 01:16:47,953
Come where?

1067
01:16:47,977 --> 01:16:49,371
You're supposed to know.

1068
01:16:49,395 --> 01:16:50,915
He said you would.

1069
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,441
(rain patters)

1070
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:57,278
(thunder booms)

1071
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:13,628
(thunder booms)

1072
01:17:21,761 --> 01:17:23,114
Now that such things
have no meaning,

1073
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,491
you'll not be
needing my services.

1074
01:17:25,515 --> 01:17:27,642
Which is, perhaps, a good thing.

1075
01:17:30,311 --> 01:17:32,373
It has become
difficult here for me.

1076
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:33,398
Difficult?

1077
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,151
Is it my illness?

1078
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,172
The extra service it involves?

1079
01:17:40,196 --> 01:17:42,424
No, and you should
know it's not that!

1080
01:17:42,448 --> 01:17:44,951
[Harry] Well, damn it, man,
will you tell me what it is?

1081
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:50,540
[Ned] I can't.

1082
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,377
Perhaps I can guess.

1083
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:59,132
Perhaps.

1084
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:01,676
Is it that you desire Sarah?

1085
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:08,099
And is it.. She
desires you in return?

1086
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:12,395
She loves you.

1087
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:19,569
I can't love her as
she should be loved.

1088
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,423
[Sarah] Harry!

1089
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:22,447
Over here.

1090
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:37,962
Our cave, Sarah.

1091
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:41,716
The one you wanted to live in.

1092
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,267
Ned is thinking of leaving us.

1093
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,524
We must think of something
that will change his mind.

1094
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:12,097
I have a longing to be well.

1095
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:14,332
It's like a pin
through my heart.

1096
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:23,216
But I'm ill, and I
always have been.

1097
01:19:27,178 --> 01:19:32,183
You see, I've been a great
disappointment to Mother.

1098
01:19:35,561 --> 01:19:40,275
She wanted someone
strong, someone reliable.

1099
01:19:42,527 --> 01:19:45,905
Someone who could see to
things after she got too old.

1100
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:49,575
And then she got me.

1101
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:53,472
You know, she talks
about immortality,

1102
01:19:53,496 --> 01:19:55,248
but you know what
she really wants?

1103
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:00,461
Just someone to remind her.

1104
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:03,089
Ned.

1105
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:09,971
From the beginning,
I've felt, between us,

1106
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:15,476
a likeness of spirit that I
haven't found in any other man.

1107
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:20,791
A likeness of spirit I
should have hoped

1108
01:20:20,815 --> 01:20:22,233
to share with my child.

1109
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:30,950
And, when I die, I won't mind,

1110
01:20:34,078 --> 01:20:36,831
because you'll be there

1111
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:40,710
to be everything I
ever wanted to be.

1112
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:49,427
Sarah will be there, being
everything I ever wanted to have.

1113
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:02,148
A child, Ned, yours and Sarah's.

1114
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,195
It could be mine, as well.

1115
01:21:10,406 --> 01:21:12,033
A likeness of all our spirits.

1116
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:23,461
Will you do this for me?

1117
01:21:28,674 --> 01:21:31,552
It would give me
the courage I need.

1118
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:37,308
(gentle music)

1119
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,702
(Sarah moans)

1120
01:22:20,726 --> 01:22:23,187
(soft music)

1121
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:04,497
[Sarah] What's that?

1122
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:05,956
Tennyson.

1123
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,749
It's yours, look,
you wrote in it.

1124
01:23:07,773 --> 01:23:09,734
"Sarah Redbridge, her book."

1125
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:15,591
I suppose you brought it up here

1126
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,283
one day and forgot about it.

1127
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:26,477
What are you doing?

1128
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,312
[Sarah] I think I should
stay like this for a while

1129
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:31,190
to encourage the
fusion of sperm and ova.

1130
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,256
Oh, right.

1131
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,686
I love you, Sarah.

1132
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,565
First of all, I love you.

1133
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,486
Promise me you'll
never forget that.

1134
01:23:58,449 --> 01:24:00,886
"Concerning diabetes. I have,

1135
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,304
"in the course of
my medical life,

1136
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:05,206
"seen a good many instances
of this formidable disease.

1137
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,479
"Of late years, a considerable
proportion of such cases

1138
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:12,648
"have got well under my care

1139
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,591
"or have had their symptoms
very much mitigated.”

1140
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,719
Considerable proportion.

1141
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:23,057
It's not all.

1142
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:28,062
No, not all, Harry,
but there is hope.

1143
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:32,108
(delicate music)

1144
01:25:12,356 --> 01:25:14,275
Sarah, wait a moment.

1145
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,238
Tell me, Sarah. Are you
quite well, quite happy?

1146
01:25:20,406 --> 01:25:21,342
Yes.

1147
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,677
I only asked because
my son has confided

1148
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:25,470
to me that he, too,
is in a similar mood.

1149
01:25:25,494 --> 01:25:28,432
He tells me he's happy,
which is rare for him.

1150
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:29,999
He says it's due to you.

1151
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:34,730
So, Sarah, if that's the case,

1152
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:37,715
no matter what has passed
between us, I'm grateful.

1153
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:42,195
[Sarah] It is not
solely due to me.

1154
01:25:42,219 --> 01:25:43,596
You're too modest, Sarah.

1155
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:46,140
I was thinking of Ned.

1156
01:25:54,982 --> 01:25:55,793
[Doctor] Does that hurt?

1157
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:56,817
[Harry] Nope.

1158
01:25:58,319 --> 01:25:59,319
- There?
- Nope.

1159
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:03,616
No.

1160
01:26:10,706 --> 01:26:13,334
(Harry groans)

1161
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:15,437
That hurts.

1162
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:16,438
[Doctor] Yes,
well, it's caused

1163
01:26:16,462 --> 01:26:19,024
by the infection in
your foot, but it will pass.

1164
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:20,734
[Harry] Good.

1165
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:24,446
I'll increase the opium
dosage to make sure that it does.

1166
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,365
Five grains, three times a day.

1167
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:28,974
(gentle music)

1168
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,370
I'm in love with you, Sarah.

1169
01:27:05,052 --> 01:27:06,679
[Doctor] I'm exhausted.

1170
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:24,530
Father?

1171
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:28,534
[Doctor] Hmm?

1172
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:31,579
I'm going to have a baby.

1173
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,790
You will look
after her, won't you?

1174
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:37,877
If she'll allow it.

1175
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,422
I shall do my best.

1176
01:27:42,965 --> 01:27:45,843
Though sometimes her pious
optimism sets my teeth on edge.

1177
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:54,119
Mother?

1178
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:55,144
Yes?

1179
01:27:56,687 --> 01:27:58,147
Would you read to me?

1180
01:28:01,108 --> 01:28:03,694
(Mother sighs)

1181
01:28:08,532 --> 01:28:11,511
You shall marry her,
Harry, I will see to that.

1182
01:28:11,535 --> 01:28:13,764
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered together

1183
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:16,016
in the sight of
God to join together

1184
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,685
this man and this
woman in holy matrimony,

1185
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:21,313
which is an honourable
estate, instituted of God

1186
01:28:21,337 --> 01:28:23,648
in the days of man's innocence,

1187
01:28:23,672 --> 01:28:25,692
and recalling unto
us the mystical union

1188
01:28:25,716 --> 01:28:28,052
which is betwixt
Christ and his church,

1189
01:28:29,553 --> 01:28:32,491
which holy estate
Christ born and beatified

1190
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,534
with his presence
and first miracle

1191
01:28:34,558 --> 01:28:39,605
(speaker fades
out). (Grand music)

1192
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:50,741
(person knocks)

1193
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,046
She says you're
to come to the house.

1194
01:29:09,343 --> 01:29:12,096
(Harry breathing)

1195
01:29:26,068 --> 01:29:27,069
Harry.

1196
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:31,657
It's your foot.

1197
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:40,541
It's all right,
Mother. It's all right.

1198
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:44,086
(man whistling)

1199
01:30:07,026 --> 01:30:09,737
(birds tweeting)

1200
01:30:13,532 --> 01:30:15,200
Give me a death I can bear.

1201
01:30:16,243 --> 01:30:18,746
(birds tweet)

1202
01:30:30,966 --> 01:30:35,971
(hooves clomp) (wagon rattles)

1203
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:03,582
(sombre music)

1204
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:47,728
Get up!

1205
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:50,504
(dramatic music)

1206
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:15,964
(Harry laughing)

1207
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:17,674
It's just like flying!

1208
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,534
(dramatic music)

1209
01:32:35,674 --> 01:32:37,968
(birds cry)

1210
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:10,876
(wagons rattle)

1211
01:33:47,162 --> 01:33:48,622
I'll not mourn him.

1212
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,209
I will not.

1213
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:00,443
(soft music)

1214
01:34:00,467 --> 01:34:02,219
Yes, yes, I know, Ned,

1215
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:07,534
but you must go.

1216
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:10,144
(sombre music)

1217
01:34:29,663 --> 01:34:32,791
(train horn whistles)

1218
01:34:34,668 --> 01:34:37,171
(train chugs)

1219
01:34:51,226 --> 01:34:53,854
(steam hisses)

1220
01:35:04,489 --> 01:35:05,466
Steady, girl.

1221
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:08,118
(steam hisses)

1222
01:35:23,217 --> 01:35:24,153
Come on.

1223
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:26,762
(steam hisses)

1224
01:35:33,518 --> 01:35:34,829
(boy whistles)

1225
01:35:34,853 --> 01:35:37,356
(train chugs)

1226
01:35:50,994 --> 01:35:54,915
(melancholic, graceful music)
