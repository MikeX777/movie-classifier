Director of Photography

Zrnić Jovanka...

Strunjek Ivan...

13
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,600
and Mitrović Života.

14
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,703
You have summons
to the magistrate again.

15
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,400
- See if he has a letter.
- I will, Mikajlo.

16
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:13,304
You denounce each other,
I bring summons every day.

17
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,122
- From America?!
- Maybe it has dollars.

18
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:17,646
- Is there anything for us?
- Not here, sign down there.

19
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:08,486
Mara... Mara!

20
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,820
Ouch...

21
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:12,847
Ah, Mara...

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,460
What is this?!

23
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Huh?

24
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,200
I forgot to tell you.

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
No electricity for two days
again, buy candles.

26
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,079
And what did I say, huh?
Why is this here again?!

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,560
- Who brought them back?!
- Why are you asking me?

28
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,560
Do with them what you want.

29
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,640
Don't you feel, for God sake,
that every corner stinks?!

30
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,160
I've said since Sunday to
throw them out, and nothing.

31
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,460
- They piss all over the house!
- Don't yell.

32
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,753
- I'll take them to the yard.
- Let go!

33
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,760
I'll take care of them myself now.

34
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
Where's the bucket?

35
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Huh?

36
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,640
Ouch... Ouch, people!

37
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,000
Shoo!

38
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,580
And bring that cat here.

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,860
I'm tired of hair and itching.

40
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,020
Really? I have nothing to do
but to catch cats!?

41
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,860
Close the door, the draft blows.
I was dying of cold.

42
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,440
Did you turn into a statue?!

43
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,780
A person can't even go
to the toilet because of you.

44
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,660
Something is always bothering her.

45
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,300
She just walks around the yard
and grinds like a mill.

46
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:43,180
- What, it's crowded again?
- He wants to kill the puppies.

47
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,940
- Where are you going with that?
- In the attic.

48
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,320
Give it to me, I'll do it.

49
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,440
And my puppies?

50
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,960
Don't worry. Go see.

51
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,180
<i>Get out of my way.
Did you turn into a statue?!</i>

52
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,740
<i>I can't get water because of you.</i>

53
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,540
<i>Take the water, who's stopping you!?
Get lost there!</i>

54
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,500
<i>Get lost there, you big mouth!</i>

55
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,039
<i>You will remember me.</i>

56
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,632
And I'll twist your neck,
sure thing!

57
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,900
At least the yard'll be clear.

58
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,700
They'll be back and pollute it all.

59
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,560
Drowning, drowning cats,
there'll be a circus.

60
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,820
Drown cats! Drown cats!

61
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,000
Drown cats! Drown cats!

62
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,020
Drown cats!

63
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,180
Drown cats!

64
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,780
Drown cats! Drown...

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,060
Just to find a stick,
they'll see...

66
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,320
Wherever you go,
they shit on your head!

67
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,340
He's gotten into a fury again!

68
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,920
The neighbors are watching us!

69
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,660
- Let them watch!
- Leave that!

70
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,180
Do you think the
whole yard is yours!?

71
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,060
Get lost, you bastard!

72
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Get lost!

73
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,560
<i>He's right. She should
mind her own business.</i>

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,800
That's it... Now I'll show you.

75
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
Wait...

76
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,840
That's it. I've had enough
of those bastards!

77
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,760
Get lost, you hoodlum!
Get out of there!

78
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,560
Leave the child, you fool!

79
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,000
- Get lost, you cow!
- The cow is your mother!

80
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,880
You cow! Get out there!
Get lost! Leave that!

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,260
Leave it! Motherfucker!

82
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,100
Don't come back home!
Do you hear?

83
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,580
Let go!
Let go!

84
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,040
Stop!

85
00:06:58,587 --> 00:06:59,987
Mile!

86
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,241
Mile!

87
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
More! A little more! Good!

88
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,660
Get back in reverse!

89
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,160
- In reverse!
- Pull the beam.

90
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,160
You need a crane.

91
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,520
See her...

92
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,140
You're watching her, huh?

93
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Go to...!

94
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,060
Has anyone started
courting the baby yet?

95
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,480
She fell in love with that guy
who lives with them.

96
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Who says?

97
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,100
- My smuggler sits on a bench with her.
- And?

98
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,120
And nothing. The guy graduated
and now he's dangling.

99
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,080
- Old man, come on now.
- Well, I could.

100
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,040
- Where does she live?
- Skenderbeg street.

101
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Oh really?

102
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
Really, little one...

103
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,120
Why are you following us,
little one?

104
00:08:58,101 --> 00:08:59,881
- She walks like a duck.
- Who says?

105
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:01,558
- Let's see.
- Here you go.

106
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,200
She has a low "body".

107
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:09,886
She's good. Does that guy
hook up with her?

108
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,257
Her?! He hooks up with others.

109
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,115
Old man, we're shlepping
over the Danube.

110
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,640
- Why are you playing Alibaba?!
- I'll catch up with you.

111
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,892
- Watch out, the fool is after her.
- Ciao ragazzi.

112
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,360
They're still here.

113
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,861
Why not leave them by the school.
The children will take them.

114
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,700
They squeeze them too much.
They can choke them.

115
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,460
Aren't you too old to play
with puppies?!

116
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,020
I'm going to the grocery store.
Want to come with me?

117
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Yeah.

118
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,120
<i>Like before,</i>

119
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,220
<i>And just the reflection in your eye</i>

120
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,820
<i>Will tell me the truth</i>

121
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,220
- Want a lion?
- No.

122
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,660
And this?

123
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,520
Look at this one.

124
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,620
He looks like me.

125
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
I don't want anything.

126
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,837
I want to buy you something.
I'm traveling tomorrow.

127
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,537
- Tomorrow?
- I have to.

128
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:42,617
Listen, it whines.

129
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,960
- I want him.
- Do you?

130
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:49,989
Here you go.

131
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,540
<i>And just the reflection in your eye</i>

132
00:10:57,697 --> 00:11:01,557
<i>Will tell me the truth</i>

133
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:12,165
Bye, little one, and watch out.

134
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,049
Why are you staring at him?!

135
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,730
Dankica, Dankica...

136
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,700
What's he to you, Danka?

137
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Grandma...

138
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,300
Look.

139
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:31,317
Take a puppy.

140
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,481
They're wonderful.
They'll play with you in the yard.

141
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,073
Why are you teasing?
Leave her alone.

142
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,640
You see she's had a stroke.

143
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,260
What did I tell you, Milan?!
Sit next to grandma!

144
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,140
Atelje 212 Theater
Edward Albee "Zoo Story"

145
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,510
- Extra ticket?
- You have one?

146
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,970
No way, I'm looking too.

147
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,650
Hey, they only accept
foreign dogs here.

148
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,790
Come on.

149
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,766
Ciao bambina!

150
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,920
Ah, I look better this way.

151
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,460
Right, little one?

152
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,100
You forgot.

153
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,780
No, I haven't forgotten.

154
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,520
Sit, little one.

155
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
Sit there.

156
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Sit down.

157
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,100
If you stay calm,
I'll take all the puppies.

158
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,220
Sit, little one.

159
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,167
Move back a little.

160
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
A little...

161
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
Good.

162
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,700
Raise your head a little.

163
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,140
Great, little one.

164
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,760
Great.

165
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,140
The same forms.

166
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,560
Now I'll show you something.

167
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:55,610
Here...

168
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,130
You see.

169
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,670
Do you care so much that someone
adopts the puppies?

170
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,010
Huh?

171
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,870
Do you still collect postcards?

172
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,550
I handed them all out.

173
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,990
To whom?

174
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,350
Because of the puppies.

175
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,150
So why are you
offering them to me?!

176
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,230
Well...

177
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,790
These have already grown...

178
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,990
and I only like them
when they're little.

179
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,030
Well, you're little too.

180
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,330
Hold on.

181
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,050
Eh, the forms... The forms.

182
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,990
We'll make coffee now.

183
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,690
I don't drink coffee.

184
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,610
<i>Wait!</i>

185
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,630
<i>Wait!</i>

186
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,310
<i>Stop! Where are you going,
you thief!?</i>

187
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,270
Uh, son of a thief mother!

188
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,890
Look what the bastard did.

189
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,570
What is it, little one?

190
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,090
You like my music box?
Is that it?

191
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,790
I like it. Yeah.

192
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:46,415
Little one...

193
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,210
I'd like to see you...

194
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,830
like you're bathing.

195
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,230
Just a few moments.

196
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,770
You understand that.

197
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:00,790
I want you to stay forever
as you are now.

198
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,590
It's too late afterwards, everything
gets distorted, everything melts.

199
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,310
You undress on the beach too.

200
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,690
I thought you won't
misunderstand me.

201
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:09,990
I do it for you.

202
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,510
Your skin is... white.

203
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,250
What is it?

204
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,910
You didn't get rid of them yet!?

205
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,570
Come on, I know where
they can camp, come on.

206
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,370
- Where?
- Come on, brother knows everything.

207
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,850
What are you afraid of?!

208
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,830
They'll be fine here,
no one will even notice.

209
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,430
Come on, faster.

210
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,090
Where will you leave them?

211
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,710
I'll mix them with other puppies.

212
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,010
- There's a bitch in the cage.
- Fool.

213
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,390
Come on.

214
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,230
Let me go! Danka, run away!

215
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,670
- I just came for a visit!
- Get lost, you bastard!

216
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,450
Look what they got together.
Look, ouch...

217
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:50,279
Lisa, darling woman.
What are you doing?

218
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,790
How are you, huh?

219
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,050
Give one...

220
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,390
- Give me one to try.
- Here I go.

221
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,730
Not that big one, a smaller one.

222
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:00,570
Just, just a moment...
Where is it?

223
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,310
This one.

224
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,410
Lisa, you whore, here's
another bastard for you.

225
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:09,215
Come on, look at her.

226
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,890
Come on... Damn!

227
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,470
- Get lost!
- Please, don't.

228
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,770
Why not?! Look at her,
just wants to fool around.

229
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,730
Get lost! Take it.
She knows her own.

230
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,890
How come!?
They're the same as hers.

231
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,790
Why are you looking at me!?
Put it in the basket.

232
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,390
You see she's embarrassed.

233
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,410
Maybe you could
keep them separately.

234
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,670
Eh, separately!?

235
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,470
Even that one has to die.

236
00:21:31,703 --> 00:21:33,843
Yes, she doesn't even want
her own puppies, bro.

237
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,010
She's lazy.

238
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,070
Poor little one.

239
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,050
- It looks sick.
- It'll die if it's not breastfed.

240
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,990
You see, you see.

241
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,570
You see.

242
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,270
You are all the same.

243
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,970
You give birth, you give birth,
and then all of a sudden...

244
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,870
everything for nothing.

245
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,610
It can't walk and it shivers.

246
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,930
And have you already started...

247
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,990
doing those things, huh?

248
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,590
Well, so what is it now?

249
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,230
What is it? What's wrong?

250
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,230
Well, you can do it, you can...

251
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,570
All women love the basement.

252
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,230
Mine learned those things here...

253
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,630
and now she can't stop,
now she's everyone's.

254
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,090
Come on...

255
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,090
Don't be afraid.

256
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,630
I'll take care of you.

257
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:57,543
Nobody will touch you...
next to me.

258
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,610
Neither you nor these scoundrels.

259
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,590
Come on...

260
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,550
Don't be afraid...

261
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:05,683
Let the old woman be furious.

262
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,810
She'll pass away soon anyway.

263
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,370
And we will live.

264
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,870
I'll buy you...

265
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,350
soap and a comb.

266
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,030
Hey, stop!

267
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,262
<i>All women buy 10 kilos of sugar</i>

268
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:11,936
<i>- and other things.
- Yes, yes...</i>

269
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,740
<i>You just want to get my money.</i>

270
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,600
<i>Your story doesn't work for me.</i>

271
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,680
<i>You always scatter everything.</i>

272
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,580
Where are you going?

273
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,460
Come here.

274
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,120
Where were you wandering?

275
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
Come on, tell your father.

276
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,420
Pour that broth for the lodger
and take it upstairs.

277
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,820
Come on, study after dinner.

278
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:09,053
The money for the grapes is on
the cupboard. Give it back to him.

279
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:13,366
Where are you going?!

280
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,140
- What about grapes?
- The store didn't have any.

281
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,820
He could get up early
for them himself.

282
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,460
I've been serving him for four years.

283
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,700
And when I spoke...

284
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,520
you did nothing. Now you
rub your head like you know.

285
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,840
<i>Another speaker at today's meeting,
Algerian Foreign Minister Bouteflika,</i>

286
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,520
<i>pointed out that in independent...</i>

287
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,196
I said not to make this house
into an animal shelter.

288
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,140
And you brought these
two birds yourself.

289
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
And what do you bring?!

290
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,240
- Bottles.
- Don't bark.

291
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,260
When will the one upstairs leave?

292
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Tomorrow.

293
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,293
<i>The Initiative for Agreement
about the Moon and Outer Space</i>

294
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:57,310
<i>which was submitted separately
in a short time span</i>

295
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,723
<i>by the USA and USSR...</i>

296
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,500
I'm going to pick up the laundry.

297
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,200
Where did she put that basket?!

298
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,283
I run all day. You don't care.

299
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,100
I'm crazy, that's what I deserve.

300
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,080
<i>At the same time, there was a hint that
the Soviet Union and NATO countries...</i>

301
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,240
<i>The 2nd Congress of Sports Federations
of Democratic Youth which ended in Sofia</i>

302
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,340
<i>was attended by representatives
of youth organizations...</i>

303
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,500
I think that redhead "lifts"
bottles in front of apartments.

304
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,880
They're all thieving scum.

305
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,280
It didn't even dry out properly.

306
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,260
Look, it fell on the ground.
I washed it in vain.

307
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,180
And those kids...

308
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,800
They hang out in the yard all day.

309
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,800
A madhouse...

310
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,780
What? Why did you stop?

311
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,940
Go wash those dishes.

312
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,360
You don't like it.

313
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,640
But you like wandering all day.

314
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,620
When you're done,
take your books in hand.

315
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,680
For God's sake, won't you
improve those grades?!

316
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,920
Look at my hands.

317
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,820
Look. Look!

318
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,880
I studied upstairs in my room.

319
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,180
- I also studied in the afternoon.
- No.

320
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,300
You will study here.

321
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,126
If your grades don't improve,
your father'll kill you.

322
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,399
I'll leave home.

323
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,580
You'll run away!?

324
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
You can.

325
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,740
Go ahead! Go now.

326
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,820
No need to burn wood.
It'll be warm enough.

327
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,960
The devil take you.

328
00:27:50,446 --> 00:27:53,619
When you go upstairs, lock the door.
You left everything open that night.

329
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,781
- Do you hear?
- I hear.

330
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
Hey!

331
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Danka!

332
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,920
What are you doing there?

333
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,340
DANKA AND...

334
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,080
Danka...

335
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,800
What are you doing here?

336
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,200
What a beautiful nose.

337
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,780
I'll just close the window.

338
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,460
I need to get up early.

339
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,530
- What do you want?
- To take the dishes.

340
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,670
What did you do with the puppies?

341
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:47,310
I hid them in the yard.

342
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,770
Nobody wants them.

343
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:50,762
I'll take them with me tomorrow.

344
00:30:54,447 --> 00:30:56,267
I got a position in the municipality.

345
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,510
I have to work there
five long years.

346
00:30:59,663 --> 00:31:00,923
Do you really want to?

347
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,186
- What?
- To take them.

348
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,190
Go away, little one.

349
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,490
What should I do with them?! You
lost a whole day because of them too.

350
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,810
Look at her!

351
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,210
I'm kidding.

352
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,970
I get up early tomorrow.

353
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:24,094
What is it, little one?

354
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:28,030
You don't like it when
they call you that?

355
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,530
You're not sleepy, huh?

356
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,090
Little one...

357
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,630
Little one...

358
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,870
What's the matter?

359
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,136
I want to cry.

360
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,510
Why?

361
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,963
Why are you crying?

362
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:02,603
Because of the puppies?

363
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,930
I'm tired. I can't feel
my legs anymore.

364
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,810
Then go lie down.

365
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,536
I have nowhere to go.

366
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,430
You said you're tired.

367
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:53,427
<i>Four hours and 40 minutes.</i>

368
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,059
<i>Dear listeners,
singing for you are</i>

369
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:58,830
<i>Simeon Gugulovski, Beti Jurković
and Đorđi Peruzović.</i>

370
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,010
<i>Like you, like you, is there anyone</i>

371
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:19,090
<i>Like you, like you, such a strangely
beautiful creature</i>

372
00:35:21,776 --> 00:35:22,856
It rained all night.

373
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:26,845
<i>Then when you laugh,
they laugh with you</i>

374
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:31,496
<i>Even those who have hated
everything since the morning</i>

375
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,950
<i>Then when they kiss,
they think they are guilty</i>

376
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:40,190
<i>Those who never think evil</i>

377
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:44,810
<i>You will make a fairy tale
out of ordinary things...</i>

378
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,290
Where are you going?

379
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,450
THE TRIP

380
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:30,010
In the lead roles

381
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,550
Screenplay

382
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:47,749
Director of Photography, Music, Editing

383
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:15,076
Direction

384
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,710
Will it take long?

385
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,270
What do you think,
someone will wait for us?!

386
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,410
A little basil and thyme.

387
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,390
There's no luck without it.

388
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,490
None of the men should enter!

389
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,430
A ruddy face from basil.

390
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,430
A little incense for St. Damian.

391
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:21,050
On Holy Sunday with the guy
in the circle dance.

392
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:24,810
Don't keep my brother waiting.
I'll catch a cold, aunt.

393
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,170
You tremble from weakness.

394
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,530
If she catches a cold again, she'll go
to the cemetery instead of the fair.

395
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,210
I'm not that lucky.

396
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,090
Calm down, Zeljo.
We're in a hurry, Zeljo.

397
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,790
My dear Milovan,
we're ready before you.

398
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,930
If she's ready,
why isn't she coming?

399
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,990
She's saying goodbye to Paćo.

400
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,130
Paćo... my hyacinth.

401
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,330
The hardest thing for me
is to leave you.

402
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,510
<i>Jelka!</i>

403
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:07,610
<i>Jelka, come here!</i>

404
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,550
Why did you put on that coat?

405
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,850
Take it off and climb in.

406
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,350
We did it because of the wind.

407
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,270
What wind? That's why she's
like that, afraid of everything.

408
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,890
Don't sell the lamb
for less than 10,000.

409
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,910
I can sell goods, don't worry.

410
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,730
Give me your hand.

411
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,010
Paćo is looking for me.

412
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,150
He can't do without me.

413
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,950
He has his own father and mother.
You take care of yourself.

414
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,870
- Come on.
- Watch out.

415
00:41:54,951 --> 00:41:56,030
Come on!

416
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:22,559
A good horse.
He was made for plowing.

417
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:24,626
Too bad. I have to sell him.

418
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,620
I need money for your wedding.

419
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,800
Really, you're thinking of marriage?

420
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
I think.

421
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,060
How, when we barely
forced you to go out?

422
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,520
I did everything that
you ordered me to do.

423
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,160
You embarrass me in town.
They say I'm a bad brother.

424
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,520
If you had a father and mother,
it'd be easy to find a groom.

425
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,020
It's not my fault
it turned out that way.

426
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,760
Come down and walk.
Get some blood in your cheeks.

427
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,260
My head hurts.

428
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,800
It's from the sun.

429
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,000
Get under the umbrella.

430
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,040
You're still hoping for him?

431
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,520
He'll never come to you.

432
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,280
Dane made you crazy and unhappy.

433
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,560
Why did he make me unhappy...

434
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,480
when he promised me?

435
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,040
Oh, my crazy. You've waited
for him for six years.

436
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,640
And the miner is a gentleman today.

437
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,580
Once he leaves, he won't return
to the village anymore.

438
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,860
For you he is...

439
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,100
dead from today.
Do you understand?

440
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,380
Yes, I do.

441
00:43:47,126 --> 00:43:48,126
What is it?

442
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,860
Why are you drooling?

443
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,420
You're upset? You want me
to beat bad luck, right?

444
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,680
I'll do whatever you tell me.

445
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,900
C'mon, let me hear a song.

446
00:44:04,526 --> 00:44:06,020
I don't feel like singing.

447
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,520
Don't challenge me.

448
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,940
Because if I get angry...

449
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,940
it'll be bad for you.

450
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,126
<i>My darling goes</i>

451
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,240
<i>My darling passes by</i>

452
00:44:31,078 --> 00:44:37,726
<i>On the trail</i>

453
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:46,743
<i>He tramples the flowers with his horse</i>

454
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:55,626
<i>On the trail</i>

455
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:04,766
<i>He tramples flowers with a horse...</i>

456
00:45:08,733 --> 00:45:10,379
<i>I know very well what I'm worth.</i>

457
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:13,433
<i>I know best what you're worth.
Let me...</i>

458
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:17,533
<i>- Oh, man, I'm a prize for you.
- Shut up for once.</i>

459
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:19,400
You spit and lick!

460
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:21,333
Shut up, woman.
Do you hear?

461
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:23,443
You woke up the
whole neighborhood.

462
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:25,722
I want everyone to hear
what you're like!

463
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:27,566
Shut up when I tell you!!

464
00:45:28,655 --> 00:45:30,322
Squeeze, bro!

465
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:31,721
You bitch.

466
00:45:32,322 --> 00:45:34,766
<i>- Don't bark.
- I know very well what I'm worth.</i>

467
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:36,357
We'll rest a bit at Milija's.

468
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,988
- Understand?
- Yes.

469
00:45:38,077 --> 00:45:39,980
<i>You bark a lot. You bark a lot,
just wait.</i>

470
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,188
I will, when I'm right and even!

471
00:45:44,277 --> 00:45:45,922
I'll show you your right...

472
00:45:51,611 --> 00:45:54,220
You scare the bear with a sieve!

473
00:45:58,211 --> 00:45:59,366
Here you go...

474
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,833
my trumpet player.

475
00:46:01,055 --> 00:46:03,500
You don't have any idea.

476
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:05,388
You better take it and play!

477
00:46:05,544 --> 00:46:08,166
When I play for you,
you'll get hurt!

478
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,855
Milija, brother, how are you?

479
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:12,244
How am I?

480
00:46:13,255 --> 00:46:14,377
You'll see.

481
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:18,537
- Help, people! The bully is killing me!
- Just wait!

482
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:20,715
- Help!!
- When I catch you...

483
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,166
- I'll beat you!
- Help!!

484
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:23,611
You won't get away from me!

485
00:46:23,711 --> 00:46:25,600
- Let me go!
- This is for my mother!

486
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:29,564
This is for my father, you cursed the
dead to roll over in their graves now!

487
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,700
Let me go! Help!!

488
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:34,655
Let me go!

489
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,155
- He'll kill her.
- Shut up.

490
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:38,740
As long as I've known them,
they've been fighting.

491
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,178
You're threatening me with
the police, huh!?

492
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:45,444
Come on, I dare you, hit me.

493
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:47,077
I won't defend myself.

494
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,555
<i>Milija, we're waiting for you!</i>

495
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:59,833
You should know that someone
will defend and avenge me.

496
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:06,788
We'll talk later.

497
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:11,280
I don't think we will.

498
00:47:13,188 --> 00:47:14,400
<i>What about the trumpet?</i>

499
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,677
We'll talk one more time.

500
00:47:29,877 --> 00:47:31,011
Hi, Milija.

501
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:32,633
Look...

502
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:35,637
- Why are you here?
- We came to refresh ourselves.

503
00:47:35,718 --> 00:47:36,918
I have nothing against it.

504
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,322
What is it?

505
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,188
You're looking for a groom?

506
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:44,166
Milija, brother,
if you know a good guy...

507
00:47:44,388 --> 00:47:46,633
Jelka is skinny, but not sick.

508
00:47:47,944 --> 00:47:50,160
She looks down at the ground.
No one will notice her.

509
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:51,944
Hear what he says?
Raise your head.

510
00:47:52,025 --> 00:47:53,932
<i>C'mon, Milija, you're paid.
They're waiting.</i>

511
00:47:54,028 --> 00:47:55,228
So you see I'm going.

512
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:57,628
By my saint day,
I'll do everything for you.

513
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:00,556
- I knew you were a good man.
- If the opportunity arises.

514
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:08,093
When we get down...
you say nothing.

515
00:48:08,508 --> 00:48:10,688
You're healthy. If anyone
asks you, shut up.

516
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:12,180
I will answer.

517
00:49:01,114 --> 00:49:04,194
Don't move. When I bring people,
don't let me catch you lying down.

518
00:49:04,874 --> 00:49:05,874
Are you thirsty?

519
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,786
- I am.
- There's the fountain.

520
00:49:08,266 --> 00:49:09,710
Fill the jug and come back.

521
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:12,236
Don't make me look for you
when I get back.

522
00:49:17,886 --> 00:49:20,158
<i>We have a little son at home.</i>

523
00:49:20,846 --> 00:49:22,370
<i>She is better to him than...</i>

524
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,662
<i>than a born mother.</i>

525
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:26,349
We barely separated her
from him this morning.

526
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,122
If it's not true...
may I burn like this cigarette.

527
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:32,942
Get lost, man.
Go away!

528
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,934
Well, brother, come on...

529
00:49:36,622 --> 00:49:37,622
Cheers.

530
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,078
You told us all nice things...

531
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:44,638
but you didn't say where the girl is.

532
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:47,694
<i>What is it now, damn it?!</i>

533
00:50:48,038 --> 00:50:49,798
<i>What happened? Play.
Go on, Milija.</i>

534
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,102
<i>Trumpeter, go on.
Don't stop.</i>

535
00:50:52,454 --> 00:50:55,062
<i>You took the money.
Why make trouble? Let's play.</i>

536
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,642
<i>Come on, Milija, play,
don't make trouble.</i>

537
00:50:57,942 --> 00:50:59,878
<i>Hey people, you're so boring.</i>

538
00:51:08,454 --> 00:51:10,678
Let him decide, I won't interfere.

539
00:51:12,134 --> 00:51:13,134
How about it?

540
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:14,790
Just... Just to look.

541
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:16,758
And maybe she suits you.

542
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:18,672
Huh? Shall we go?

543
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:20,942
Waiter!

544
00:51:21,399 --> 00:51:22,743
Waiter, let's pay!

545
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:25,670
Leave it, I'll pay.

546
00:51:26,326 --> 00:51:27,326
Get lost.

547
00:51:27,806 --> 00:51:29,534
- How much is it?
- 35 tens.

548
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:31,926
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

549
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:34,951
Are we going or not?

550
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:36,902
The wagon is there, it's not far.

551
00:51:37,158 --> 00:51:38,534
Here, look.

552
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:41,862
That's her.

553
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:44,470
Jela, get out of the wagon,
people came to see you.

554
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,030
Come on, guy, don't be afraid.
Come on.

555
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:49,719
Come on. This is Milutin.

556
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,462
Here, meet each other
and then you'll see.

557
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,414
"I have a sewing machine"

558
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:15,643
What is it?

559
00:52:16,902 --> 00:52:18,002
Do you want her?

560
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:20,954
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

561
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:22,666
You saw her.
What did you decide?

562
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:26,720
- I'm not for marriage.
- You lie.

563
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:28,682
You don't like her.
Say honestly.

564
00:52:29,274 --> 00:52:31,438
- What can I do, it's his will.
- Come on.

565
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,599
Milija...

566
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,390
Let me tell you...

567
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,086
Your wife ran away.

568
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:44,416
- When?
- Just now.

569
00:52:44,497 --> 00:52:46,690
The peasants say
she went with Sreten.

570
00:52:54,028 --> 00:52:55,228
What will you do now?

571
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:57,244
Their pleasure will be spoiled.

572
00:52:59,148 --> 00:53:00,894
Listen, I have
the right one for you.

573
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:03,100
You don't have to marry her.
Just bring her home.

574
00:53:03,452 --> 00:53:04,452
I decided.

575
00:53:05,196 --> 00:53:06,844
I'll kill Sreten and then her.

576
00:53:07,148 --> 00:53:09,452
You won't regret it.
She's small, ruddy...

577
00:53:09,628 --> 00:53:10,628
A widow.

578
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:13,804
This very day, I'll take revenge.

579
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,484
It'll be hard to find a guy
with a sewing machine.

580
00:53:21,756 --> 00:53:23,020
Now they want a tractor.

581
00:53:23,468 --> 00:53:25,028
Swear on my luck, it's like that.

582
00:53:26,764 --> 00:53:28,252
Waiter! Two brandies!

583
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:30,220
I tell you honestly...

584
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,268
It wasn't a serious illness.

585
00:53:32,364 --> 00:53:34,284
Her bones ached and she
lay there until winter.

586
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:36,172
Now she's up and works
around the house.

587
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,244
To tell the truth, I wouldn't want
problems like with the first.

588
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,484
She dragged herself like
she was beaten.

589
00:53:41,788 --> 00:53:43,036
She suffered, suffered...

590
00:53:43,836 --> 00:53:45,892
- and passed away.
- I assure you she's healthy.

591
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:48,188
I wouldn't cheat you,
swear on my health.

592
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:54,920
What's she like?

593
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,900
Skinny...
But she can endure a lot.

594
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,352
- Where is she?
- In the wagon.

595
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:02,316
Waiter, two more brandies.

596
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,692
In the wagon?

597
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,996
Why doesn't she walk?

598
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,564
So she doesn't roam around.

599
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:09,756
And she has to watch our things.

600
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:11,116
Let me tell you...

601
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:12,980
I brought something to sell...

602
00:54:13,596 --> 00:54:14,596
As I say...

603
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:16,116
Here she is.

604
00:54:16,444 --> 00:54:17,804
I have to look first.

605
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,932
I can't promise anything like this.

606
00:54:22,508 --> 00:54:23,732
Let her come down...

607
00:54:24,076 --> 00:54:25,400
if it's not hard for her.

608
00:54:27,292 --> 00:54:28,292
Jela...

609
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,028
Get out of the wagon.
The man wants to talk to you.

610
00:54:34,956 --> 00:54:37,900
Jela, Ratko is looking for a wife.
He's asked about you a long time.

611
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:39,244
Talk...

612
00:54:39,372 --> 00:54:41,392
Make a deal... I won't interfere.

613
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:42,700
I'll be in the tavern.

614
00:54:45,276 --> 00:54:46,908
I don't know what to say.

615
00:54:47,596 --> 00:54:50,316
I told him in passing
that I need a wife.

616
00:54:50,556 --> 00:54:51,872
Then he pounced on me.

617
00:54:53,052 --> 00:54:54,540
I can't get married.

618
00:54:55,356 --> 00:54:56,456
I'm weak.

619
00:54:57,276 --> 00:54:59,020
I can't do hard work.

620
00:54:59,404 --> 00:55:02,892
Your brother must be tired of you,
so he wants to get rid of you.

621
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:05,404
Yes. Just don't betray me...

622
00:55:06,524 --> 00:55:08,108
Say that you don't like me.

623
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:10,016
He thinks he can cheat me.

624
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:12,832
Well... such a person
hasn't been born yet.

625
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:22,176
- Can't you play anything cheerful?!
- It's from the heart.

626
00:55:22,668 --> 00:55:24,764
Bad luck beats me all day
with your howling.

627
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,528
The heart can't be commanded.

628
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,400
What do you say?

629
00:55:30,652 --> 00:55:32,252
So if we agree...

630
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:33,768
I'd take the horse.

631
00:55:33,932 --> 00:55:36,188
The horse... is not for sale.

632
00:55:36,556 --> 00:55:39,356
- Then it's not worth talking about.
- What's wrong now?!

633
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:41,769
Buddy, she's weak.

634
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:43,568
Take her home to lie down.

635
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:48,421
- Really, how much for the horse?
- How is she weak now?!

636
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,092
And you said to bring her.

637
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,653
You promised, let's not argue.

638
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:56,156
- I didn't promise anything.
- You lie.

639
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,980
And you wanted to see her.

640
00:55:58,508 --> 00:56:01,356
Man, even if I was looking for her,
I wouldn't take her.

641
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,100
- She's sick.
- How do you know?

642
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:04,604
I see, I have eyes.

643
00:56:04,956 --> 00:56:06,716
You promised, Ratko, you take her!

644
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,828
Let me go...

645
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:12,012
No one can command me.

646
00:56:13,388 --> 00:56:14,388
Stop!!

647
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:15,688
Stop, when I say!!

648
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:27,396
Let me go!

649
00:56:29,084 --> 00:56:30,084
Let me go!

650
00:56:32,844 --> 00:56:33,892
He wants...

651
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:36,169
to give me his sick sister.

652
00:56:36,428 --> 00:56:37,916
I'm not stupid either.

653
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:39,452
You peasant nit...

654
00:56:40,515 --> 00:56:42,299
Yeah... There she is.

655
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:43,980
That's her.

656
00:56:44,476 --> 00:56:46,060
Look, folks...

657
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:47,360
He offers her to me.

658
00:56:47,517 --> 00:56:48,941
She has no life...

659
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,988
and he wants to marry her off.

660
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,872
He's looking for someone to cheat.

661
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,800
Nope, bro!

662
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:56,512
I'm not stupid!

663
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,740
<i>Stop!</i>

664
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:01,956
Here...

665
00:57:04,252 --> 00:57:05,420
I'll take her.

666
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,160
Come with me.

667
00:57:08,516 --> 00:57:10,080
We'll make a deal right away.

668
00:57:38,168 --> 00:57:41,060
Milija, you need to come back.
They don't have a trumpeter.

669
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,192
I'd rather kill someone...

670
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,017
than play.

671
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:50,088
- Well... you agree and she's gone.
- I do. I give my word.

672
00:57:50,392 --> 00:57:53,520
She'll pay for this, curse my luck.
I just have to catch her.

673
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,896
When I get my hands on them...

674
00:57:56,136 --> 00:57:58,208
- Both of them.
- What can you do to them?!

675
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:01,644
Find a rifle and you'll see.

676
00:58:07,352 --> 00:58:08,352
Milija!

677
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:10,528
Take it.

678
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:19,312
You shoot well.
Your wish will come true.

679
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,680
I'm not done yet.

680
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:22,240
I have to kill her too.

681
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,388
She'll pay for this, when I
get my hands on her.

682
00:58:29,544 --> 00:58:31,292
Where did she get lost
all of a sudden?!

683
00:58:34,008 --> 00:58:36,840
- I told him you shoot really well.
- Sorry, it was an accident.

684
00:58:37,032 --> 00:58:38,684
You seem to be in a hurry.

685
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,920
Watch out,
you could miss a guy that way.

686
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:42,408
I don't need anyone.

687
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:44,064
And where were you going?

688
00:58:44,664 --> 00:58:45,664
I'm getting away.

689
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:46,896
From whom?

690
00:58:46,984 --> 00:58:48,616
From my brother, suitors, everyone!

691
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:49,928
Two hits.

692
00:58:50,104 --> 00:58:52,216
You got the ring. The prize...

693
00:58:52,456 --> 00:58:53,720
for a fiancée.

694
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,440
Oh no, there's my brother.

695
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:03,176
He won't really kill you!?

696
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,616
He's making me get married,
better to kill me.

697
00:59:06,632 --> 00:59:07,720
Let's go.

698
00:59:09,457 --> 00:59:10,457
Go away.

699
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,584
Where did she go?!

700
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,928
Why is she running from me?

701
00:59:15,256 --> 00:59:16,772
I won't go back to the village.

702
00:59:17,032 --> 00:59:19,464
If your brother finds you,
what will you do then?

703
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,200
Even if he finds me, it's no use.
I won't return to the village.

704
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,212
If you don't return to the village...

705
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:30,108
stay with me.

706
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,716
- How?
- Nicely.

707
00:59:33,096 --> 00:59:34,864
I mean... stay with me.

708
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,040
How can I stay with a married man,
for God's sake?!

709
00:59:42,744 --> 00:59:44,364
I didn't mean anything bad.

710
00:59:45,368 --> 00:59:46,988
Milija, like a brother...

711
00:59:47,096 --> 00:59:49,732
help me. Take me and I'll do
everything in your house.

712
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,660
Let's go.

713
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:04,248
Give me your hand so
we don't get separated.

714
01:00:04,328 --> 01:00:06,032
It'll be easier
to escape that way.

715
01:00:08,936 --> 01:00:11,080
There she is!
There, that skinny one.

716
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:12,432
Follow me!

717
01:00:21,464 --> 01:00:23,737
Over here... They won't
look for us here. Here.

718
01:00:23,844 --> 01:00:25,804
I'm afraid!
If I take off, I'll fall!

719
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,681
- What did you say?
- If I take off, I'll fall!

720
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:31,240
Don't be afraid. I'm behind you.
Hold on tight.

721
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:33,240
Come on, people!
Come on, folks, now!

722
01:00:33,336 --> 01:00:35,560
One hundred bucks a ride!
100 bucks!

723
01:00:35,688 --> 01:00:36,856
100 dinars, please.

724
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:40,476
- Come on, bro, don't hold back.
- Thanks. C'mon, get off the carousel!

725
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:41,912
Done, let's start!

726
01:00:47,048 --> 01:00:48,048
Stop!!

727
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:49,864
<i>Stop!</i>

728
01:00:50,952 --> 01:00:52,440
<i>Stop when I tell you!</i>

729
01:01:10,904 --> 01:01:13,832
- Milija, damn you...
- Huh?

730
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:34,944
Word of honor...

731
01:01:35,688 --> 01:01:36,728
I'll take her.

732
01:01:40,888 --> 01:01:42,648
<i>Stop!</i>

733
01:01:59,464 --> 01:02:00,700
Look, damn it...

734
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:04,592
She found one with a sewing machine,
and me with a tractor, nothing.

735
01:02:05,336 --> 01:02:06,748
Screw her.

736
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,524
Word of honor.

737
01:02:15,624 --> 01:02:16,624
I...

738
01:02:17,992 --> 01:02:18,992
I...

739
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,516
She's running from me again.

740
01:02:26,216 --> 01:02:27,480
Pooh, asshole!

741
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,420
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

742
01:02:31,576 --> 01:02:33,148
<i>No one to give the man a hand!?</i>

743
01:02:35,854 --> 01:02:36,954
Come on, get up.

744
01:02:42,568 --> 01:02:44,616
You wanted to get away from me.

745
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:02,840
Milija!

746
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,440
END
