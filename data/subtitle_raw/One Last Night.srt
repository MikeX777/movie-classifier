1
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:25,290
¶ I'm gonna live my life
just like a holiday ¶

2
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:31,663
¶ I will not work, no,
not for another day ¶

3
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:39,338
¶ Since I met you, I will
not waste a single day ¶

4
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,343
¶ From now on, my life's a
holiday ¶

5
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,383
¶ The wind it's cold outside, ¶

6
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,720
¶ And a gloomy sky ¶

7
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,489
¶ But inside of my mind, ¶

8
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:01,093
¶ Oh, the sun is shining ¶

9
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,395
- Zoe?

10
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,263
Hey.

11
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:05,130
- Hi.

12
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:05,798
- Hey, how you doing?

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,665
- Good, good, oh.

14
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,467
- European.

15
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:09,334
- Yeah.

16
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,552
- Sorry I'm late.

17
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:11,769
- That's all right, I just got
here.

18
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,704
- Cool.

19
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,274
So, finally.

20
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,409
- Yeah, you were tough to get a
hold of.

21
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,277
- Yeah.

22
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,478
- Do you live far away?

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,413
- No, just a couple miles away.

24
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,315
- Oh cool, yeah, me too.

25
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,550
- Great.

26
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:26,251
- Cool.

27
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,019
- Tickets?

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,786
- Yes.
- Let's go get' em.

29
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,720
Okay.

30
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:34,159
¶ Since I met you, I will
not waste a single day ¶

31
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,360
- Hello.

32
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,197
Hi, just picking up
tickets I booked online.

33
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:40,399
I got them here, actually.

34
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,267
Hang on a second.

35
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,368
- There's no signal in here,

36
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,737
you're gonna have to go outside.

37
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,605
- Okay yeah.

38
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,473
Just give me a second.

39
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,407
- Okay.

40
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,611
Long night, huh?

41
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,415
- Yeah.

42
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:07,426
- Crossword, yeah that's hard.

43
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,360
- Yep.

44
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,637
- Found it.

45
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,305
Voila.

46
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,740
- Yeah, you're good.

47
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:22,841
- Great.

48
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:25,811
We'll also take a medium
popcorn,

49
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,746
and what do you want to drink?

50
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,231
- Water's fine.

51
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,715
- Make that two waters, please.

52
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:34,153
- No more popcorn, we're closed.

53
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,489
- What do you mean no more
popcorn?

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,824
There's a machine with a
bunch of popcorn inside of it.

55
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,459
Can't you just serve it to us?

56
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,793
- See the clock?

57
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:43,795
It's 10:15.

58
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,299
- I can't see a clock.

59
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,601
- No popcorn after 10.

60
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:50,536
Rules.

61
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,572
- Right.

62
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,474
It's not a gin and tonic.

63
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,209
It's popcorn.

64
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,811
- Jerry, can I sell the popcorn?

65
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,816
Jerry says no popcorn.

66
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,385
That's a negative.

67
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,719
Rules are rules.

68
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,656
- I didn't hear his answer
clearly.

69
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:11,790
Are you sure?

70
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,443
- Nevermind.

71
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,261
Haven't you heard? Popcorn's
dangerous after 10.

72
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,763
What are you thinking?

73
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,898
- Who knows what I was thinking.

74
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,518
I don't know what to say.

75
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,353
- Thank you.

76
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,222
- Enjoy your movie.

77
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,523
- So many questions.

78
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,259
Who's Jerry, where's the clock?

79
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,672
I think we're in this row.

80
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,875
- Yeah, 'cause there's
so many people in here.

81
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,978
I don't care.
- One, two, three, four.

82
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,579
Yeah.
- Do you mind?

83
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,414
Just in case
someone else sits there.

84
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,282
- If you prefer, we can go back
there.

85
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,717
- No, no, that's fine.

86
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,618
You're fine.

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,619
We're fine.

88
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,597
I've been looking forward
to this movie for a while.

89
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,799
- Oh yeah?

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
- Yeah, I saw the
trailer three months ago.

91
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,334
- Cool.

92
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,736
- Big DeNiro fan.

93
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:31,670
- Yeah.

94
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,840
Hathaway's pretty clutch.

95
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:35,874
- Clutch?

96
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,177
- Yeah.

97
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,479
- I don't know this word,
clutch.

98
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:47,886
- Where did he get the popcorn?

99
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,922
- Just stay leave it, just leave
it.

100
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:51,790
- I need you to clarify.

101
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,658
I'm gonna go back.

102
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,525
- Look.

103
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,393
- Why?

104
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,427
- Just leave it be.

105
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,460
He needs it more than you do,
okay?

106
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,629
- Oh.

107
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,965
- Wow, that's horrible.

108
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,602
- I'm gonna--

109
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,569
- No, look, the movie's about to
start.

110
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:05,637
- Seriously?

111
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,875
All right, fine, sure,
I'll just have a water.

112
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:10,976
I love water.

113
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,311
- Me, too.

114
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,612
- Mmm.

115
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:28,927
- What?

116
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:31,830
- There's so many other seats.

117
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,405
- Just wait, just leave it.

118
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,913
Are you enjoying the movie so
far?

119
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,515
- Yes, it's good.

120
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,587
- That transvestite
DeNiro twist was weird.

121
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,189
Didn't see that sex change
happening.

122
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,857
- No, it was cool.

123
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:22,541
- I just want to watch the
credits.

124
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,109
Got a friend of mine.

125
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,844
He's a dog handler.

126
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,513
- Sure.

127
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,948
- I just wanna see his name.

128
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,597
It's just coming up.

129
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,199
- No, it's fine.

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,800
- Also, it might be like,
one of them deleted scenes.

131
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,668
- Mmm.

132
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,535
- Always happens.

133
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,970
- Yeah sure, sure.

134
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:57,576
- Must be a different film, I
guess.

135
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,244
- Good to go?

136
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,580
- Yeah, we're good to go.

137
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,917
Did you lose something?

138
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,686
- My phone?

139
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:08,620
Oh.

140
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,526
- Maybe it dropped out
when you were snoozing.

141
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,927
- Okay, I was thinking,

142
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,163
and I can't think when
it's too bright, so.

143
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,030
- Gotcha.

144
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,065
- I was resting my eyes.

145
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,199
- Yeah, yeah.

146
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,072
Ow.
- Ooo, careful.

147
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,076
Did you like the film?

148
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,811
- Come on, I mean, who buys the
story

149
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:35,614
of an 80-year-old grandpa who
gets an unpaid internship,

150
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,883
and then still gets to
bang the massage therapist?

151
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,818
I mean, completely logical.

152
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,622
- Did you check your jacket?

153
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:49,060
I thought there was a
lot of hope in the movie.

154
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,197
I mean, that you can
still get the masseuse

155
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,299
even though you're 80.

156
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,168
- Hmm, that's fair, I can see
it.

157
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,638
Oh here.

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,839
- Oh, oh good.

159
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:02,841
- Great.

160
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,744
That was fun.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:06,645
- Ready to go?

162
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:07,679
I gotta get going.

163
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,314
- Yeah, I've gotta go as well.

164
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,182
I haven't fed my dog.

165
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:15,787
I forgot to, didn't have
time, and feed the plants.

166
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,589
- Yeah, I really need to pee,
so.

167
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,924
Let's go.
- Pee away, yeah.

168
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:21,026
Not here, but yeah.

169
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,827
I think let's leave.

170
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,865
- Here, in case you get bored.

171
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,667
You know what, I'll just hang
onto it.

172
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,302
- Okay.

173
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,936
I'll meet you in the lobby.

174
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,570
- Cool, I'll just be a minute.

175
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,581
He's cute.

176
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,950
Ish.

177
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,956
This is the last time I date
anybody from a frickin' app.

178
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,408
Oh, my God.

179
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:54,858
But what is up with that stupid
accent.

180
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,995
I do not why people are into
that.

181
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,797
I mean, "I'll wait for you in
the lobby,

182
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,666
"would you like some popcorn?"

183
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,901
Just stop complaining.

184
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,235
Think of Trench.

185
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,845
Ready.

186
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,848
- I've got good news,
and I've got bad news.

187
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,116
- Okay, can you tell me outside?

188
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,951
I have to get going.

189
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,785
- I should probably tell
you the bad news, then.

190
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,655
We're locked in.

191
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,356
- Yeah, right.

192
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,658
- No, unfortunately, we are.

193
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,093
I've tried every door.

194
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,628
But it's not working, so.

195
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,096
- Are you serious?

196
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,033
This isn't funny.

197
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:38,937
It's not romantic, either.

198
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,740
- Look, I don't wanna be here
just as much as you don't.

199
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,675
- Who even still goes to
the movies on a first date?

200
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,360
Is that even a thing?

201
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,044
A dating tip from your
grandma, or something?

202
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:51,850
- No, she passed away before
she could give me any tips.

203
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,053
Jesus.

204
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,791
Well, the good news is,
eventually they'll let us out.

205
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:04,429
We might as well grab a
drink, have some gourmet food.

206
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,866
Security cameras will pick us
up, and someone will find us.

207
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,149
Dinner's ready.

208
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,297
So, on tonight's menu, we have
two gourmet hot dogs, with a

209
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,103
ketchup and mustard blend,
with poorly chopped onions.

210
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,706
And for desert, you're gonna
like this,

211
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,308
an assortment of chocolate bars.

212
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,178
- Alex, this isn't funny.

213
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,746
I need to get back to work.

214
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,248
- Work?

215
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,749
Who goes on a date before the
night shift.

216
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,818
Really?

217
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,886
For the appetizer, I was
thinking, you know, popcorn cup.

218
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,256
But as you know, no popcorn
after 10, so.

219
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:07,792
- Make some.

220
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,994
- It is a bit messy.

221
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,062
- Hm, first.

222
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,333
- Really?

223
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,335
Okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

224
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,409
Jean Raffanier, 2000 and
something.

225
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,810
Good year.

226
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:26,478
- Classy.

227
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,297
- Yeah.

228
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,115
- Now, I'm a little hungry.

229
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,049
- Good.

230
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,258
- Well, I assume my
cooking isn't that bad.

231
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,328
- Do you cook, except for, you
know?

232
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,430
- Now and then.

233
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,832
- Don't ask.

234
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:51,236
I know, I have a
microwave, so why would I?

235
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,437
- Your health.

236
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,274
- Let's not even go there.

237
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,077
I love all things gluten, sugar,

238
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:04,015
palm oil and Nutella, caffeine
and dairy.

239
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,118
- Well, add a bottle of red
wine,

240
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,121
and I'd consider another date.

241
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:15,193
- So, when did your grandma pass
away?

242
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,803
- Like 22

243
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,274
years.

244
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,441
22 years.

245
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,010
- Years?

246
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,211
You made it sound like it was
yesterday.

247
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,213
What is wrong with you?

248
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:40,285
- I know how to calm people
down, don't I?

249
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,256
- You psycho.

250
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,361
How 'bout that popcorn?

251
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,206
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

252
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,507
You can't keep pushing
buttons and expecting popcorn.

253
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,108
It takes finesse.

254
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,629
No, leave it.

255
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,946
We need three tablespoons of
popcorn oil,

256
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,515
otherwise it'll burn.

257
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,452
- How do you know so much
about making popcorn, nerd?

258
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:18,489
- My parents had a popcorn
machine when I was growing up.

259
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,259
Assuming that the universal law

260
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,128
of popcorn-making still applies.

261
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,197
- Do you get to see your parents
often?

262
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,399
- Not as much as I'd like.

263
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,137
Wanna try?

264
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:36,074
- How hard can it be?

265
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,943
No one ever burns popcorn,
right?

266
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,148
- Take this in here.

267
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,650
- All right.

268
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,584
- Right.

269
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,886
Two scoops.

270
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,554
Just don't make it messy.

271
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,156
There we go, that's it.

272
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,057
- Oops.

273
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,392
A little clumsy.

274
00:14:56,663 --> 00:15:00,465
Relax, it's not like
we have to clean it up.

275
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,234
- There we go.

276
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,572
There we go.

277
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,142
Okay.

278
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:12,410
For your safety.

279
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,478
- Thank you.

280
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,281
Now we wait?

281
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,482
- Yep.

282
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,084
Suspense.

283
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,685
It's actually a
science, really, making popcorn

284
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,653
- Is it?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,454
- Wow.
- It's an art.

286
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,656
Very cool.

287
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:25,590
Pop art.

288
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,557
Pop art.

289
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,247
- That's it.

290
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:51,950
That's it.

291
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,287
So then, you just dump it all
in.

292
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,288
- Well, look at that.

293
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,156
- There we go.

294
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,023
- We made popcorn.

295
00:15:59,025 --> 00:15:59,958
- We did.

296
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,531
- Ah, thank you.

297
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,433
- No problem.

298
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,969
Nice and clean, there we go.

299
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,970
Can you pass me a cup, please?

300
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:12,704
- Yeah.

301
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,378
- Oh, there we go.

302
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,245
Thank you.

303
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,180
- Sure.

304
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,319
Ow.

305
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,025
Could you not do that, please?

306
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,228
Please don't do that.

307
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,162
Really?

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,432
Ooo, sorry.

309
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,433
Oh, my bad.

310
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,170
Ooo, sorry, beg your pardon.

311
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,305
- Oh, whoops.

312
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,040
My bad.

313
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,308
- Come on, come on.

314
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,776
- Oh, got it in the eye.

315
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:52,710
- How you like me now?

316
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,611
Oh, oh.

317
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,446
- Oh, he means it.

318
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,648
- Here we go, go on, hide.

319
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,752
Can't hide from me forever.

320
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:02,754
- Watch me try.

321
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,690
- Oh, it's coming raining.

322
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,125
- Oh.
- It's raining.

323
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,527
- Okay, all right, relax, relax.

324
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:12,697
- Bam.
- Oh.

325
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:15,733
Wow.

326
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:18,636
A gentleman, I see.

327
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:25,810
- Wow.

328
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,388
- Do you think we'll ever get
out of here?

329
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,791
- Why, you got somewhere to be
tomorrow?

330
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:40,725
- Yeah.

331
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,796
Wow, made a mess.

332
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,432
And no help.

333
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,136
I need a piece of paper.

334
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,072
- Okay.

335
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,646
Here we go.

336
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,580
- Great.

337
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,397
- I can't read what that
says, and I'm two feet away.

338
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,100
I don't think security's gonna
read that.

339
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:26,204
Plus, if anyone was
here, we'd be kicked out.

340
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,273
- You got a better idea,
smartypants?

341
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:34,378
- Well, there must be a
spare set of keys somewhere.

342
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,348
- You look on your
side, I'll look on mine.

343
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:55,466
Boom.

344
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,702
My way.

345
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,373
Is that supposed to be a clue?

346
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,208
- Well, let's try and see.

347
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,727
- Yeah, right.

348
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,245
That's when we split up in
the dark, and then one of us

349
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,248
gets savagely murdered, probably
me.

350
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,950
Thank you very much, but I am
staying

351
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,651
right here, in front of the
cameras.

352
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,652
- Oh.

353
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,921
Miss Concerto chickens out.

354
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,591
Don't be a baby.

355
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,326
Look, it's better than,
what, just staying here?

356
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,397
- Okay, will you hold on?
- Finally.

357
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,566
I'm coming.

358
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,168
- Come on.

359
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,235
- Okay.

360
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,571
It's kind of exciting.

361
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,705
- Ah ha.

362
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,607
Yes.

363
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,235
- Wow, you really know how

364
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,719
to entertain a girl on a first
date

365
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,823
I warn you, if anything
or anyone pops out,

366
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,759
I'm on their side, not yours.

367
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,429
Why do you think it says
my way, dot dot dot?

368
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,697
- I don't know.

369
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,900
They must be a fan of Sinatra.

370
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:03,768
- Right.

371
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,936
Fly Me to the Moon.

372
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,704
- Or Come Fly with Me.

373
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,772
- So cheesy.

374
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,341
Oh.

375
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,777
Sorry, that's probably something
stupid.

376
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,711
- Yeah.

377
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,248
Oh yeah, just go ahead.

378
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,355
- Oh, Jesus.

379
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,456
- Oh.

380
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,757
All clear.

381
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,227
Thought I saw something.

382
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,661
- Such a freak.

383
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,363
What was I thinking?

384
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,832
Only weirdos have online dates.

385
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:35,900
- Oh come on, silly, we can
share

386
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,436
online dating stories later.

387
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,710
- Hmm.

388
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,578
- All right.

389
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,654
Hm.

390
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:58,389
You need a code?

391
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,757
- Huh, weird.

392
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,791
I mean, it looks like it.

393
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,593
- Hm, well, find it.

394
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,596
- Fine, I will.

395
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,847
Hm.

396
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,450
Well, it's not up here.

397
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,390
- Here?

398
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,725
Let's find out.

399
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,668
Hm.

400
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:50,574
Don't tell me you've never been
locked in a theater before.

401
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,028
Oh, come on.

402
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:55,378
You've never been to an escape
room?

403
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,348
- Escape what?

404
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,083
- Room.

405
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,817
You pay $100, they lock
you in a staged room,

406
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,722
and you solve a bunch
of clues, and escape.

407
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,057
It's pretty cool.

408
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,360
- Why would I pay to be
locked inside a room?

409
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,362
- Isn't that what you did
tonight?

410
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:12,763
- Smart ass.

411
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:21,806
Come on, whenever you're ready,
Macgyver.

412
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,078
- Six time seven?

413
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,014
- Numbers not your thing?

414
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:33,417
- Okay, I have discount-chulia,
it's a disease.

415
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,821
So, I would I appreciate it if
you wouldn't be so sarcastic.

416
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:38,556
Thank you.

417
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,626
42.

418
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,828
- Times eight?

419
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:46,997
- 336.

420
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:47,865
- Times five.

421
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,133
- Really?
- Mmhmm.

422
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:50,468
- Times five.

423
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,437
1480, no, no, 1680.

424
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,639
Wow.

425
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,376
Really?

426
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,410
- Uh-huh.

427
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,617
- That's pretty good.

428
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,120
I'm impressed.
- Mmhmm.

429
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,821
All right.

430
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,156
- Oh.

431
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,991
Got a short here.

432
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,626
- Short film.
- That's what it looks like.

433
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,694
- Are you trying to kill me?

434
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:17,628
- No.

435
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,598
No, shorts are boring.

436
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,899
- Actually, incorrect.

437
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,934
Boogie Nights would not be
Boogie Nights

438
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:27,638
if it didn't have the short
start, so.

439
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,572
- Touchy.

440
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:30,725
- It's about to start.

441
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:31,609
We got 30 seconds, come on.

442
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:32,877
Go, go, go.

443
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:33,811
Key.

444
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:51,729
- Boogie Nights, really?

445
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,464
That's all you got?

446
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,668
I swear, you're killing
me with this right now.

447
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,170
- But do you have a better idea?

448
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,505
- It's starting.

449
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,505
- Is that the guy from Big?

450
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,074
- You know, we don't need to
whisper.

451
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,143
We're alone in here, so.

452
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,679
Talk normally.

453
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,648
- Thank you.

454
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,050
- Unless Jerry's here.

455
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:49,587
- I never saw that guy.

456
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,224
She was bonkers, wasn't she?

457
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,028
Zoltar's doing a good
job, yeah.

458
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,097
- Is it just me, or does he
kind of look like Tom Hanks?

459
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:00,998
- Who, Zoltar?

460
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,666
- No, the big guy.

461
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,569
Yeah, I can see it.

462
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,188
- 'Cause he's giving me a vibe.

463
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:08,806
- Yeah, it's a show, actually,
it's a good observation.

464
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,040
Kinda like boy-ish charm.

465
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,108
- She's like, quality.

466
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,610
- Yeah yeah, no, I get it.

467
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:13,277
- Exactly.

468
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,612
- Ruggedly handsome.

469
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,931
Is that how you'd describe Tom
Hanks?

470
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,249
More like straight man,
actually, more like, you know.

471
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:20,284
Yeah.

472
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,552
Yeah.

473
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,819
You're right,
he is the guy from Big.

474
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,288
Yeah, he is, yeah.

475
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,755
He was great in
Riding in Cars with Boys.

476
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:26,624
Did you see that?

477
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:27,291
No.

478
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,192
- It's a good movie.

479
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,660
I studied at the university.

480
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:30,528
- Oh yeah?

481
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,695
- Yeah.

482
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,997
- Studied Riding in Cars with
Boys?

483
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,098
- It's a great movie, okay?

484
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,666
Drew Barrymore's tour de force.

485
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:38,802
Should have won an Oscar,
Steve Zahn's wonderful.

486
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:48,145
You probably know the movie
he was in called Honey.

487
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,547
- Missed that one.
- It's a classic,

488
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,948
it's a dance movie classic.

489
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,316
Dance movie classic?

490
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,817
- Yeah, that's right.

491
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,655
Jessica Alba plays a
street dancer named Honey.

492
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:58,889
Gets into some bad problems.

493
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,090
- I do love me some Jessica
Alba.

494
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,041
- Exactly.

495
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:01,991
- Who doesn't?
- Who doesn't?

496
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,561
- Apparently we agree on that.

497
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,295
- Good.

498
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,765
Ooo, what's this?

499
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,601
She is pissed.

500
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:13,137
Well, wouldn't you,
if someone took your chair?

501
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:15,673
Obviously she's got a dodgy knee
or hip.

502
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,575
She didn't take her
chair, there are other chairs.

503
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,577
Yes, but it's
obvious she's an elderly lady,

504
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,745
who needs some sort of
assistance.

505
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,148
What's happening, what's that?

506
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,583
I don't know.

507
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:29,019
It looks like
she just hit her there.

508
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,722
It's about young people
responding not well

509
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:36,026
to the elderly ideologies of
what has come from the past.

510
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,127
That seems like a
stretch.

511
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,227
But then, she's
blocking her now,

512
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,663
so she's also not helping.

513
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:40,831
You're agreeing.

514
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,366
Just booted her out.

515
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,701
Well, we need to work
together.

516
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,235
That's the whole point.

517
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,370
- No, you're.

518
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:47,237
- Tete-a-tete, you know?

519
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,340
Tete-a-tete?

520
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:50,341
See, he's gonna let her win this
one.

521
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:52,527
Oh.

522
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,712
Is this gonna be a
whole movie about tic-tac-toe?

523
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:56,046
Would you let me win?

524
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,848
Not a chance.

525
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,784
Good to know, thanks.

526
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,785
What's your type?

527
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,653
- Tom Hanks.

528
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:03,387
- Right, that's good.

529
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,206
- What were you looking for?

530
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,024
- I don't know, something
flattering.

531
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:08,759
- Colin Firth?

532
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,544
Hugh Grant?

533
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,328
- Yeah, there we go, that's
okay.

534
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,065
Hugh Grant, yeah, a little less
foppish.

535
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,734
- Foppish, what is foppish?

536
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,902
- Just, you know, a bit foppy.

537
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,804
- That doesn't explain it.

538
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,106
You can't use the word in the
definition.

539
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,074
It's not actually a thing.
- Okay, fine.

540
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:27,111
Foppish, to be fop, slightly
dandy, but sort of pathetic,

541
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,245
you could say.
- Slightly dandy?

542
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,313
- Dandy.

543
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,515
- What's dandy?

544
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,716
- Sorry, we found the language,
not you.

545
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,689
Now, let's get back to the game.

546
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,394
Ostentatious.

547
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,029
Ooo.

548
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,898
- Do you know what that means?

549
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,766
- Yeah.

550
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,168
Do you?

551
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,102
- Yes.

552
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,038
- Cool, I'm glad we both know.

553
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,172
- Good, okay.

554
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,910
The ability to attract
attention to oneself.

555
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:00,978
Ostentatious.

556
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,079
- Oh, so you've been familiar

557
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,147
with that word for a long time.

558
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,081
- Hmm.

559
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,386
So, she almost
gave him her number.

560
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,888
See, she's got the hat, she gets
it.

561
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,374
It's the same dress

562
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:14,691
as the seven year old, the
pigtails.

563
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,293
Oh.
- Oh.

564
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,828
No.

565
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,831
She's cramping his
style.

566
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,267
Yeah, I know what
that's like.

567
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,242
I don't know if I get it.

568
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,244
You're not meant to get
it.

569
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:35,646
Me personally, or

570
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,047
everyone?
- No, just in general,

571
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,448
you're just not meant to get it.

572
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:39,849
That's the whole point of it,
it makes you ask questions.

573
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,151
There's no answers.

574
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,820
It's like a bad episode of Lost.

575
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,488
Actually no, it's like
every episode of Lost.

576
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,956
- I haven't seen Lost either.

577
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,224
- Don't bother.

578
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,776
- I don't have a TV.

579
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:50,327
- I lost three years of my life
to it.

580
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,396
- 10 minutes of tic-tac-toe.

581
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,132
Some writers definitely lack
imagination.

582
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,334
- But it's not about
tic-tac-toe.

583
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,403
It's a modern vision of
the sprayed sprinkler.

584
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,939
- Oh, of course, right.

585
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,874
You're a writer wannabe, right?

586
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:06,160
- Thanks for the wannabe.

587
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,445
- Sorry, I mean a writer
soon-to-be, is that better?

588
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,948
Okay, so, if we were to write
this, wouldn't you want to be

589
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,984
more universal, talk
about the big picture?

590
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,753
- You work in a book store,
right?

591
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,921
- I'm a literary specialist.

592
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,490
- Okay.

593
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,058
Well, you should try and write
yourself.

594
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,426
And then you can judge.

595
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,494
- Wow, okay.

596
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:25,863
So, we're gonna elude this
topic.

597
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,464
Remind me not to debate with you
again,

598
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,033
you really go for the jugular.

599
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,340
- Whoa, whoa, what were
you writing on the notepad?

600
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:39,476
- Oh, I don't know, just notes.

601
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:42,279
That they might be useful.

602
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,922
So.

603
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,793
What brought you to LA?

604
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:56,794
Wanted to be an actor?

605
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,028
- Oh, God no.

606
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,029
Much worse.

607
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:02,399
I followed a girl who
wanted to be an actress.

608
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:03,267
- Oh.

609
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,468
What happened.

610
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,471
- Well, she followed a guy

611
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,807
who will make her into an
actress.

612
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,074
- Oh, do I know her?

613
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:12,793
- Maybe.

614
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:14,511
Are you familiar with the
Starbucks on 4th and Highland?

615
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,847
She makes the best frappuccinos.

616
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:20,884
- What's your story?

617
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,853
- Oh, I moved here to go to law
school.

618
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,605
And?

619
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,356
- Well, I decided that
my life was worth more

620
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:30,160
than just being a
lawyer, so I dropped out.

621
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:34,031
- Not as glamorous as Legally
Blonde?

622
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:34,965
- No.

623
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:39,036
I actually created my own
handmade custom t-shirt company.

624
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,405
You contact me on my
website, pitch me your idea,

625
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,440
I design it, send you back three
options,

626
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,510
you pick, and for $29.99,
you get it in your mailbox

627
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,413
within 14 days, and you pride
yourself on quality materials

628
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,548
and outstanding customer
service.

629
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,449
- Wow.

630
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,187
- Hey, come on, give
it back to me, please.

631
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,857
- I just wanted you to play
something.

632
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:00,524
- It's not tuned.

633
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,959
- Well, we can tune it.

634
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:02,793
- No.

635
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:03,626
- But you're wearing a yes
t-shirt.

636
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:04,459
- What, you speak French now.

637
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:06,163
- Of course.

638
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,030
I'll give it back to you in a
minute.

639
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,031
- Alex.

640
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,031
You're meant to be a
product.

641
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:10,031
Meant to be a player?

642
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:11,031
Come on, seriously.
- Yeah, a player.

643
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,302
- Okay, okay, okay.

644
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:13,170
- Come on.

645
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:14,171
- I'll give it back.

646
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:15,105
- Thank you, come on.

647
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:15,973
- I'm gonna give it back.

648
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:17,875
Here you go.

649
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:18,542
- Thank you.

650
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,696
- Wow.

651
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,380
I always thought a violin
was a string instrument,

652
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,649
not a woodwind.

653
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:32,289
Are you in an air guitar band?

654
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,024
'Cause that makes a lot of
sense.

655
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:37,094
- It was a prop at my old job,
okay?

656
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,596
A prop?

657
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:42,199
- I thought it would look cool.

658
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,067
- I don't understand.

659
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:46,236
- Listen.

660
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,540
I have no special skills.

661
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,977
I'm 28, and I have no idea
what I'm doing with my life.

662
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:57,014
I print t-shirts in my
free time, and I pretend

663
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,515
to know everything about
literature,

664
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,919
even though I barely read
Alice in Wonderland as a kid.

665
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,988
- What do you mean, you barely
read Alice in Wonderland?

666
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,457
- Like, I mostly read it, but.

667
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,594
- What about Animal Farm.

668
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,129
- Mmm mmm.

669
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,431
- You must have read The Hobbit.

670
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,365
- No.

671
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:19,069
- The Harry Potter series?

672
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,304
- I missed it.

673
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,972
The Goosebumps
anthology.

674
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,440
- Okay, that's a guy's series.

675
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,341
Girls don't read that.

676
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,143
- Okay, Sweet Valley High.

677
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,078
The Babysitter's Club.

678
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,681
The Bible?

679
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,452
What about Tom Sawyer?

680
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,320
- I read Tom Sawyer.

681
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,188
There we go.

682
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,359
- 'Kay, I saw the cartoon, but.

683
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,496
- No that's, well, at
least it's the same story,

684
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,732
but you didn't really
put the work into it.

685
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,133
- Mmhmm, yeah.

686
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,710
- Did you use the violin to
impress me?

687
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,547
It worked.

688
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,015
Mission accomplished.

689
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:06,683
Look, honest.

690
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,552
Mission accomplished.

691
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,593
- Stop, in the name of the law.

692
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,196
Dumb

693
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,131
Pull.

694
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,570
- Did you hear that?

695
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,671
- No.

696
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,408
- Come on, the footsteps.

697
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,610
I swear I heard something.

698
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,717
- So, why choose the violin?

699
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,521
Did you steal it from an
old granny, or something?

700
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:21,191
- I told you, it was a prop at
my old job.

701
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,529
And it looks cute.

702
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,365
- You're such a hipster.

703
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,300
Was this at the bookstore?

704
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:34,438
- No, actually, I used to
work at an escape room.

705
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:50,087
- Have you ever seen a taser
that you couldn't handle?

706
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:58,128
Broke it.

707
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,798
Yeah, that was so sweet.

708
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,534
Oh, my gosh, that was so sweet.

709
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,339
Okay.

710
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,814
It is time to get the bad guys.

711
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,365
- Where are you going?

712
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,334
- Don't worry, I'll be back in a
minute.

713
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,201
Go back to sleep.

714
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,503
- Don't leave without me.

715
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,437
Promise.

716
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:42,506
- Promise.

717
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,167
Come on, Taryn.

718
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:14,171
Take off your earbuds
and answer the phone.

719
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,725
- Who's there?

720
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,527
- Your brother, popcorn freak.

721
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,663
What was that about?

722
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,798
- I don't know, I just
thought you should be healthy.

723
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,966
How's it going?

724
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,434
Actually, very well.

725
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:45,936
We just finished the short.

726
00:36:45,938 --> 00:36:47,237
- Did she like it?

727
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,872
- She doesn't understand art.

728
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,508
- Yeah, right.

729
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,808
Good thing you didn't
show her the little guys

730
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:55,345
on the traffic light, or
whatever the fuck that shit is.

731
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,380
- Yeah, yeah, well one
day, you'll thank me

732
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,416
for being part of my adventures.

733
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,318
Yeah, doubtful.

734
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,288
- Anyway, look, I need
a couple of hours, so.

735
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,590
- Oh, come on.

736
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,325
I have a life.

737
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:09,292
- Please.

738
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,860
Look, I'll make it up to you.

739
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:11,761
Promise.

740
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,965
- Is she even worth it?

741
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:15,899
- She was.

742
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:16,766
I mean, she is.

743
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:19,236
I mean, she could be.

744
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:22,539
I think she's overall pretty
clutch.

745
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,708
- Clutch, that's so romantic.

746
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,309
Thank you.

747
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:28,278
- Always a pleasure.

748
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,881
- Oh, oh, and remember
to tell Escott, yeah?

749
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,357
- Shit.

750
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,036
Pick up.

751
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,273
Voicemail?

752
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,007
Useless.

753
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,745
Pay him to sit in his chair
and watch the monitor.

754
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:04,314
And answer the phones.

755
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:06,650
Oh, my God.

756
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:11,688
Mmm.

757
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,249
- Hey.

758
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,067
You don't move, you don't speak,

759
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,736
and you do exactly what I say.

760
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,738
Escott--

761
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,541
- What did I just say, no
talking.

762
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,744
Now, put your hands up, or I
tase you.

763
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,517
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

764
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,988
Oh, a bottle of wine
and some chocolate bars,

765
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,059
and oh, my favorite, Twizzlers.

766
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,628
That sounds like jail time to
me.

767
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,480
- Escott.

768
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:55,331
- Listen, if you say one
more word, I am gonna stick

769
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:58,435
a charge into you like
you wouldn't believe.

770
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:01,004
Wait, how do you know my name?

771
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,640
- And now the penny drops.

772
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:06,910
What the fuck, Escott?

773
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:09,696
- Oh, mt God.

774
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,481
I'm so sorry, I never,
the thing just went off,

775
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,851
and I didn't know that that was
you.

776
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,119
- I was sitting behind you.

777
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,488
No, but I thought you
left.

778
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,458
But Taryn told you
I was staying here tonight.

779
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,095
- No, no, no, no, Mr. Porter,
she did not, I promise.

780
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,996
- She said that I was
gonna be staying here

781
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,765
for a couple more hours.

782
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,533
No, no, not
tonight, she didn't.

783
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,535
Oh, God Taryn.

784
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,671
So, how long have you had this
toy for?

785
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,040
- Well, since last week.

786
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,509
It makes me feel safer.

787
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:40,961
- Yeah?

788
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,412
Maybe you could do a
little bit more practice.

789
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:45,715
- Yeah, well, I know, but
it's really hard to practice,

790
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,818
and I didn't know that
it was gonna be so fast,

791
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,589
and if it makes you feel any
better,

792
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,657
you were my first.

793
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,792
- Great.

794
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:56,860
Great, okay.

795
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:58,528
Listen to me, Escott.

796
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,163
Yes, Mr. Porter?

797
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:04,067
- You can leave, but you must
lock the doors before you go.

798
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,435
- Right, okay, yes.

799
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:07,003
- Don't worry about security.

800
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,471
I've got your back.

801
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:10,039
But Escott?

802
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,108
Quiet.

803
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:14,010
- Got it.

804
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,011
- Okay?

805
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:15,912
- Quiet.

806
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,113
- Good.
- Yes.

807
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:20,784
- Have these.

808
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:21,751
- Thank you.

809
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,466
I get to keep the taser, right?

810
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,901
- Yes, you can keep the taser.

811
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,486
- Yes.

812
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:41,070
- Just keep it away from me.

813
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,105
- Got it.

814
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,707
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

815
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,642
- And now.

816
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:48,978
- Perfect.

817
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:51,881
Okay.

818
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,777
- You were gone a while.

819
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,512
- You already can't be without
me.

820
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:23,980
- I may have missed you a
little.

821
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,248
- I brought more supplies.

822
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,583
- Ah, wine.

823
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,718
I need wine.

824
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,819
- I bet you do, Sue Ellen.

825
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:32,622
More red wine.

826
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,758
Oh, make yourself at home.

827
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,960
- Mmhmm.

828
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:39,062
Just getting more comfortable.

829
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:41,197
We might be here a while.

830
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:45,535
Wow, you don't need to get me
drunk.

831
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,137
- I'm sorry.

832
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:48,738
I think I'm in the wrong
theater, I was looking for Zoe.

833
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,190
- Hmm.

834
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:51,641
You know, I'm really, really
tired.

835
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,709
- Then you should go to bed.

836
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,010
- Mmm.

837
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,814
But, when I'm tired, I
get very, very horny.

838
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,621
- Well, maybe I can help with
that.

839
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:08,691
- Hmm, I'm sure you would
be very, very helpful.

840
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,928
Do you think we'll ever get out
of here?

841
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,965
- Hopefully not.

842
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,001
I mean, we have wine, we
have food, and I have you.

843
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:19,168
Sounds like paradise.

844
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,603
- Yeah.

845
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,272
That sounds marvelous.

846
00:42:22,274 --> 00:42:27,544
But, if that's so, then maybe,
we could have Escott join us.

847
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,012
Wouldn't that be fun?

848
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,047
I mean, the more, the merrier.

849
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,048
- Escott, what?

850
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,716
- What was the rest of the plan?

851
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,652
You take advantage of me, and
then,

852
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:37,086
you suddenly find the key
somewhere?

853
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,022
- No, listen to me, listen.

854
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,690
- Hey, no, you listen to me.

855
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,559
I have been listening to
your bullshit all night.

856
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,994
How many ladies have had the
privilege

857
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:46,195
of being stuck in this shit
hole?

858
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,597
- It's not like that.

859
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,798
- Yeah, right, okay, you know
what?

860
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,034
If I ever hear from you, see
you,

861
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:55,104
or even smell you again,
I swear to you, I will,

862
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,707
chop your balls off.

863
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,612
¶ You say that you change, ¶

864
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:05,048
¶ That you were a better man ¶

865
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,850
¶ But I've heard it all ¶

866
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,986
¶ What have took me for ¶

867
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,988
- Ah, some popcorn, or,

868
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,860
whoa, calm yourself, woman.

869
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:20,296
I knew something was
wrong with that chick.

870
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:22,098
¶ Oh no ¶

871
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,300
¶ You're not the one I need ¶

872
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:27,904
¶ And you're not the everything
¶

873
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:30,640
¶ Oh ¶

874
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,709
¶ Oh no ¶

875
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:34,978
- I'm sorry.

876
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,080
- Eh, it was coming.

877
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:38,815
I can't believe she was the only
one

878
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:42,218
that thought my film was not
good enough.

879
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,856
Fine, apart from you, Roger
Ebert.

880
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,730
- What the hell did you guys do?

881
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:57,266
- She did have a
different way of thinking.

882
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:05,041
- Well, it looks like she
knows how to have fun.

883
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:08,111
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'll clean
up.

884
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:21,157
- Miss Taryn, you really
should have called me.

885
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:25,995
- Thanks for the heads up.

886
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,730
- Yeah, no problem.

887
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,137
- Did you guys know the
cacklet sleeps standing up.

888
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,738
They dive down to grab snatches

889
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,875
of sleep that last about 12
minutes,

890
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:42,345
and then they slowly drift to
the surface.

891
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:44,881
Head first.

892
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,784
- Wow.

893
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:48,718
- Yeah.

894
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:51,120
- That's fascinating.

895
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:52,055
- Mmhmm.

896
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:03,066
- I'm gonna get some sleep.

897
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,333
I think you guys should, too.

898
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:06,836
If you want to do it standing
up,

899
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:09,338
sitting down, or lying
on the couch, I'm out.

900
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,278
- Wait.

901
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,914
I'll give you a ride.

902
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:18,848
- Yeah.

903
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,419
Okay guys, I'll lock up.

904
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,733
18th hole.

905
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,503
Augusta National.

906
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,505
For the masters.

907
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,443
Get in your hole.

908
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:51,914
Let's go for a new personal
record of 403 in a row.

909
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:57,353
Oh, that's short.

910
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,287
Gosh.

911
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:03,960
Okay.

912
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,295
I think it's the ball.

913
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,197
I had a personal record going,

914
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:11,934
and then, I just go, and I screw
it up.

915
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:14,003
And now, I'm back at it.

916
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:17,440
And that is what you call a
victory dance.

917
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,980
- Thanks a lot, enjoy your
night.

918
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:24,914
- Bye.

919
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:29,085
- So, how many people.

920
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:33,122
- Four, plus two, plus three,
plus four,

921
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,056
so--
- 13.

922
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:35,825
- 13.

923
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:38,361
- We need to do something.

924
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:41,364
We can't carry on the way it is.

925
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:43,366
- Maybe I have an idea.

926
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,202
- Okay.

927
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,805
Do tell.

928
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,908
- Okay, you can't compete
with the multiplex.

929
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,211
So, why don't we do something
different.

930
00:46:56,881 --> 00:46:57,814
- Right.

931
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:01,284
Your plan does have a stage two,
right?

932
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:03,219
- Do a themed theater.

933
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:06,022
- A themed theater?

934
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,090
- Okay.

935
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:11,861
So, today we had 13 customers.

936
00:47:11,863 --> 00:47:13,129
$10, that's,

937
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:14,363
- 130.

938
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,399
- Smart ass.

939
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,434
So, what if we have five
screenings a day,

940
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:21,170
but only two customers per
screening?

941
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,006
Now, you're thinking,
that's less than now.

942
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,476
But no, not if we charge $50 per
customer.

943
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:30,780
Why 50?

944
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:33,248
Because the price of the
movie date experience.

945
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,486
- Okay, continue, go on.

946
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,957
- All right, so, for two hours,

947
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:43,926
the theater is theirs, entirely
theirs.

948
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:47,997
No employees, no popcorn
girl, no projectionist.

949
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:50,566
They have entry, and then the
whole place to themselves.

950
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:54,403
Basically, it's home at the
theater, or theater at home.

951
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:56,339
The first DIY theater.

952
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,412
- That's great.

953
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,280
No, that is an unbelievable
idea.

954
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,382
I could kiss you.

955
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,967
- Don't kiss me.

956
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,551
- No, I'm not going to, but
that's still a great idea.

957
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,153
- And last but not least, we can
supervise

958
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,155
from the security room, so
if they have any issues,

959
00:48:13,157 --> 00:48:14,991
we can interact with them from
there,

960
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,326
just like in an escape room.

961
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,230
- What is it with you
girls and escape rooms?

962
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,465
- Hm?

963
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:23,399
- Nothing.

964
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,169
No, I really like this.

965
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,005
This is great.

966
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:32,141
Okay, let's start it
tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m.

967
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,876
- I'm sorry, eight?

968
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,610
- Well, great entrepreneurs wake
up early.

969
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:37,680
It's a compliment.

970
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:40,283
You'll get used to it, relax.

971
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:46,055
- I should have kept my mouth
shut.

972
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,424
Yo, the towel, you're bringing
it home?

973
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,626
- Yeah, it's a white flag.

974
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,419
- He just took a left.

975
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:28,497
Deli meat, eight letters.

976
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,166
What have you got?

977
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,736
- Salt beef.

978
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,137
What?

979
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,639
- Salt beef.

980
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,374
- Salt beef, that isn't a thing.

981
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:39,675
- It is a thing.

982
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:42,044
It's a deli.

983
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,412
Good evening, welcome,
how you doing tonight?

984
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:53,756
- How the hell wrote a movie
about this stupid game?

985
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,761
- Great choice.

986
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:02,498
- In a world of war and
injustice,

987
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,702
Bruce has found a way to
bring back peace on earth.

988
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,771
Tic-tac-toe toe toe toe.

989
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:13,743
- You know, I was thinking, T,

990
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:16,012
you should apply for a job at
Disney Land.

991
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,425
I mean, your

992
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:20,249
be much valued over there.

993
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:21,183
- Honey.

994
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:27,416
- Was salt beef right?

995
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:28,484
- Salt beef isn't a thing.

996
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:30,319
- It is a thing.

997
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,455
You have it on rye bread.

998
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:36,192
It's taking you this long.

999
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:53,776
- Hello.

1000
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,111
Anybody here?

1001
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:58,180
It's your lucky day.

1002
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,815
You have a customer trying to
buy a book.

1003
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,550
- Yes, yes, coming.

1004
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,887
Hi, I'm here, how can I help
you?

1005
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:06,789
- Back there, like, working out?

1006
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,324
- Long story.

1007
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:11,494
So, what is it you're looking
for?

1008
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:12,795
- It's a gift.

1009
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,763
Something readable.

1010
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:18,234
Yeah, readable is a good start.

1011
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:21,237
Fun, but dramatic at the same
time.

1012
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:24,373
I don't know, something new.

1013
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,374
- Hm.

1014
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,476
How 'bout US Weekly?

1015
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,911
- Oh, she's funny, too.

1016
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:32,181
- Wait a minute, you look
familiar.

1017
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,383
You're the popcorn freak.

1018
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,502
- Guilty.

1019
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:37,652
Okay, but just listen to me for
a second.

1020
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,754
- Look, I don't have time for
this.

1021
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,523
I have work to do.

1022
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,291
- No, it'll just take a minute,
I promise.

1023
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,927
All your customers can wait.

1024
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:48,164
- It's the holidays,
people buy food, not books.

1025
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:51,233
- Oh, of course, it's the
holidays.

1026
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:54,570
All right, so Alex has this
new concept at the theater.

1027
00:52:54,572 --> 00:52:55,905
It was actually my idea.

1028
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:57,873
I am the brains, after all.

1029
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,377
But you would like it,
so you should come by.

1030
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:02,411
- Look, popcorn.

1031
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,313
- Taryn.

1032
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,214
- Look, Popcorn Taryn, I know in
a romcom,

1033
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:08,851
that would be the perfect time
for me to start missing Alex,

1034
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,452
having remorse and run to him,
but--

1035
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:13,589
- Hm, she's an expert of the
cinema, too.

1036
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:15,391
- I know my classics.

1037
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,793
But the fact is, I'm really over
him,

1038
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,595
if I was ever into him in the
first place.

1039
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:23,265
So, I appreciate the thought,
but I think I'll pass.

1040
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:25,501
- You guys are both so stubborn.

1041
00:53:25,503 --> 00:53:26,435
- Look,

1042
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:30,506
I have to get back to working
out.

1043
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:31,874
- Be careful carrying on like
that.

1044
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:34,610
I might start to like you soon.

1045
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,682
If you ever change your mind,
text me.

1046
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:42,518
Don't call me, speaking on
the phone gives me anxiety.

1047
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:44,819
- Looks like you're gonna need
more time

1048
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,422
to find the right book.

1049
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:47,790
- No, you're right.

1050
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,992
I'll stick with US Weekly.

1051
00:53:51,796 --> 00:53:53,395
- Bye.

1052
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,374
Let's go out, meet
fresh meat.

1053
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,808
No, I can't go,
I have work tomorrow.

1054
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,911
Come on, where's the
stool?

1055
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,665
- Yeah, I know.

1056
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,850
Seriously, no one
will notice, it's dead empty.

1057
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,885
Anyway, what's the plan for
Halloween?

1058
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:19,354
- Of course, I'm not doing
anything for Halloween.

1059
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:20,256
A costume.

1060
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,857
- Nope, not negotiable.

1061
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:24,426
- Boring.
- Yeah, I know.

1062
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,262
Well, I guess
I'm just gonna sit here

1063
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,563
and stare at my cat.

1064
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,165
- Okay.

1065
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,766
I have a pile of t-shirts to
finish up.

1066
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,701
You can come help me instead.

1067
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,370
Halloween's overrated.

1068
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,505
Get yourself
a boyfriend to help.

1069
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:37,740
- A boyfriend?

1070
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:38,774
Yeah, right.
- Netflix and--

1071
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:40,776
- I do not not have Netflix.

1072
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,328
I do not wanna chill.

1073
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:43,879
- Hey, they're not all twats
like Alex.

1074
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:46,448
I mean, they almost all are.
- Hey.

1075
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,983
I gotta go, Thai food's waiting.

1076
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:49,551
Okay, enjoy ironing.

1077
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:50,552
- Okay.

1078
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:51,754
Bye bye.
- Bye.

1079
00:54:57,428 --> 00:55:01,430
¶ I want to walk with you in
moonlight ¶

1080
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:04,333
¶ And I know you're not in
heaven ¶

1081
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:06,368
¶ Go on and pretending ¶

1082
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:11,373
¶ That I really thought this ¶

1083
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:15,811
¶ Oh, when you're with me,
darling, ¶

1084
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:20,883
¶ You mean more to me than
anyone else ¶

1085
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:26,455
¶ I'm so confused by you ¶

1086
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:30,392
¶ I don't know what to do ¶

1087
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:43,539
- What time are they coming?

1088
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:44,873
- The first couple are coming at
six,

1089
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,408
then we have 30 minute break.

1090
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,344
Second one comes at nine.

1091
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:49,778
- That's exciting.

1092
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,846
- Yeah.

1093
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:51,913
- Is the security room ready?

1094
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:52,981
- All ready.

1095
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:57,753
- All right.

1096
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:58,854
Everything's fine.

1097
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,989
Let's go get a beer, we have an
hour.

1098
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,591
- We have beer here, I don't
need a beer

1099
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:05,661
- Well, let's go get some fresh
air.

1100
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:08,964
- T, I was thinking, when are
you gonna get a proper job?

1101
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,999
- I could never stop working
with you.

1102
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:13,869
- You can't really call it work.

1103
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:14,870
- Let's go.

1104
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:17,473
- Fine, okay.

1105
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,575
Just for an hour, though.

1106
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:20,776
Can't be late.

1107
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,616
Taryn, what are we doing now?

1108
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:29,585
- Please, it'll just take a
minute.

1109
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:32,154
- I don't think they sell
gossip magazines here.

1110
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:33,555
- Don't start.

1111
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:37,726
Hello, your favorite customer is
here.

1112
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:42,698
- Oh, you again.
- Ah.

1113
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,667
- Look, if you need a
copy of Harry Potter,

1114
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,703
even signed by JK Rowling,
maybe I can help you.

1115
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:50,739
But if you're here to talk
about him, I think we're done.

1116
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:55,477
- Oh, I promise, I'm not
gonna talk about Alex, but,

1117
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:56,145
yeah.

1118
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:57,112
- What the hell, Popcorn?

1119
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:58,680
- Taryn, it's Taryn.

1120
00:56:58,682 --> 00:56:59,715
- Yeah, what the hell, Popcorn.

1121
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:00,716
- You don't start.

1122
00:57:00,718 --> 00:57:01,817
We're all here because of you.

1123
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:02,684
- Me?

1124
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:03,585
I didn't ask to be here.

1125
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,503
- Yeah, right.

1126
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,420
- I've got much better things to
do.

1127
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:06,422
- Mmhmm.

1128
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:07,089
- This is going well.

1129
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,792
- So, why are you here?

1130
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,494
To apologize, to beg me to
give you a second chance?

1131
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:14,163
Tell me how much you love me?

1132
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:15,948
Why?

1133
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:17,732
- No, I'm here because I got
tricked.

1134
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:19,768
- Oh, another of your little
games?

1135
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,971
- No, Taryn said we were
grabbing a drink to relax,

1136
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,506
and instead, she brought me
here.

1137
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:25,574
- Oh, like a date?

1138
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:26,608
Have you ever thought of dating
her?

1139
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,210
You two would make a great
couple.

1140
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,144
Kant.

1141
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:35,184
- I don't really think that's
legal here.

1142
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:36,118
My sister.

1143
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,053
Sister?

1144
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:39,855
- Well, half-sister.

1145
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,790
Same dad.

1146
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,091
He passed away three years ago

1147
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,527
before we inherited the theater.

1148
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:47,896
- Wait, so that's your theater?

1149
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:49,832
- Yeah, all mine.

1150
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,233
Mine and Taryn's.

1151
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:57,506
We have a new concept, so I
really need to get going, so.

1152
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:58,173
- New concept?

1153
00:57:58,175 --> 00:57:59,107
- Yeah.

1154
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:02,044
You seen Taryn anywhere?

1155
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:02,911
No.

1156
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:03,846
- Taryn?

1157
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:12,521
You have keys, right?

1158
00:58:12,523 --> 00:58:13,522
- Oh, shit.

1159
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,693
- I really don't have time for
this.

1160
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:18,560
Taryn.

1161
00:58:18,562 --> 00:58:19,661
Taryn.

1162
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,663
I took her keys.

1163
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:22,531
- Taryn, what the hell?

1164
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:23,699
- Yeah, what the hell?

1165
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:24,967
- Oh, calm down.

1166
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:27,703
Get back to work, guys,
figure out more clues.

1167
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,104
All you've done is put up
cameras

1168
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:31,940
and shitty instructions
on how to make popcorn.

1169
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,575
Tell me you got a plan.

1170
00:58:33,577 --> 00:58:34,927
- She's probably right.

1171
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,278
- Look, I'm not gonna tell you
again.

1172
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,046
Let me out, come on.

1173
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:40,782
- You said she was the
queen of escape rooms.

1174
00:58:40,784 --> 00:58:43,986
Figure it out, and I'll open the
door.

1175
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:48,657
Whatever.

1176
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,162
- No, no, no.

1177
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,796
Okay, hey, maybe you can help,
okay?

1178
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,598
Remember our little
adventure at the theater?

1179
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,133
- Do I remember?

1180
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,667
- Okay, poor choice of
phrasing, fair play.

1181
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,970
Well, it inspired me.

1182
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:03,672
- I'm listening.

1183
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:05,941
- You guys love your dating
adventures in this country.

1184
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,376
- Dating adventures?

1185
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,810
- Yeah, you know about
dating, it's not about

1186
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:11,280
who you're with, it's about
having fun on the date.

1187
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:13,466
- So cliche.

1188
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,651
- Well, I made a new adventure.

1189
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,819
- What, you're selling your
services at the theater now?

1190
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,121
- Ha ha, very funny.

1191
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,890
No, it's a dating concept.

1192
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:23,225
A couple come to the theater,

1193
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,960
and they get locked in
for a couple of hours.

1194
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:25,861
- What, an escape room?

1195
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:26,728
- Exactly.

1196
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,680
- That's my idea.

1197
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,631
- God, it is crazy in
this city how many people

1198
00:59:30,634 --> 00:59:32,901
think it's always their idea.

1199
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,303
- Right, my idea.

1200
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:38,307
- Ah, nice t-shirt.

1201
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:44,079
Anyway, we have our first
customers in a couple of hours.

1202
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,214
And if I'm not there, my idea--

1203
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:47,983
Hey, I can hear you.

1204
00:59:47,985 --> 00:59:49,251
- Taryn's idea,

1205
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:53,655
okay, your idea, whatever, it'll
be gone.

1206
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,359
- You had the popcorn figured
out.

1207
00:59:57,361 --> 01:00:00,362
- Yeah, but we need a puzzle or
something,

1208
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:02,664
a more mysterious element to it.

1209
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:05,934
- What about the projector,
how hard is it to load a film?

1210
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:06,969
- Pretty easy.

1211
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:08,604
I mean, even Taryn can do it.

1212
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:12,674
- Okay, okay.
- Sometime today, please.

1213
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:14,343
- What about the projection
booth?

1214
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:15,944
We needed a code to get in
there, right?

1215
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,379
Come on.

1216
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:21,783
- Maybe we can hide the code
somewhere?

1217
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:26,688
I don't think the answer's
gonna be in a book.

1218
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,623
- Tah-dah.

1219
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:29,925
- Great, now she thinks she's
Houdini.-

1220
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:30,859
- Open it.

1221
01:00:33,364 --> 01:00:36,632
The cards are numbered, two
through 10, with four suits.

1222
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,033
Right?

1223
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:40,969
- Zoe, it's now not really
the time for strip poker.

1224
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,740
- Two through 10 can be our base
numbers.

1225
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:47,275
Jacks, queens, kings, and
aces are mathematical symbols,

1226
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,378
and the equation can be laid
out in sequence of suit.

1227
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:50,846
We just need to come up

1228
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,714
with another equation that
equals 1680.

1229
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:54,750
- Sure.

1230
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,785
- And the cards can be taped
to the bottom of the chairs

1231
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,820
in the theater, and it'll be
like a scavenger hunt, too.

1232
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,055
And the seat number on the
ticket

1233
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:02,290
can be the first clue
of the scavenger hunt.

1234
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,892
- Yeah, yeah, perfect.

1235
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:04,760
Right, yeah?

1236
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:05,794
Okay, good.

1237
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:06,662
Let's go, come.

1238
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,233
- Hey, we have your idea, open
up.

1239
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:13,435
- Yes, great.

1240
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:18,440
Okay.

1241
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:21,677
Where is she?

1242
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:23,011
- No idea.

1243
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,046
- Well, we don't have time.

1244
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,080
Come on.
- No, I'm going to call her.

1245
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,148
- No, no, no, Alex, come one.

1246
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,349
No, let's just take this.

1247
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,885
- Yeah, I'm not gettin' on that,
thanks.

1248
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,020
Look she's gonna answer,
I promise you, I swear.

1249
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,822
- Can you ride a bike?

1250
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:35,123
- Yeah, I can ride a bike, it's
just,

1251
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,459
I haven't in a long time.

1252
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,894
- You can't.

1253
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:40,762
Oh, this is so good.

1254
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:41,763
Okay.

1255
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:42,831
- It's ringing, it's ringing.

1256
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,921
- Alex, just get on the back.

1257
01:01:43,922 --> 01:01:45,010
- She's gonna answer.
- You know you don't have time

1258
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:46,099
to wait, she's not answering.

1259
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:47,135
- No, it takes her a while.

1260
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:48,236
- We don't have that much time.

1261
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,805
Do you want to be late?

1262
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,041
Come on.

1263
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,776
- It's still ringing, she's
gonna answer the phone.

1264
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:56,945
- Oh man, you are scared, you
are scared.

1265
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:57,913
- I'm not scared.
- Yeah, you are.

1266
01:01:57,915 --> 01:02:00,749
It's fine, you're scared.

1267
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,017
- There you go.
- Will you get on?

1268
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:03,218
- I'm getting on.

1269
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,419
- All right, here we go.

1270
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:05,287
- Okay.

1271
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,455
Whoa, okay.

1272
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:07,389
You'll be fine.

1273
01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:10,075
This is really not fun.

1274
01:02:10,076 --> 01:02:11,726
We're gonna make it,
don't worry.

1275
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:13,795
Oh, the bike
doesn't sound too healthy.

1276
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:16,198
I'm too scared to look down at
my watch,

1277
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,333
but I really shouldn't have
enough time.

1278
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:19,768
We're running late
- We're fine, we're going

1279
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,836
as fast as we can.

1280
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,054
Do you wanna drive?

1281
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:23,271
No, I really don't
wanna drive.

1282
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:25,273
- How much do you weigh?

1283
01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,475
- I don't weigh that much.

1284
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,210
That was my knee.

1285
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:29,377
- Stop complaining.

1286
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:30,979
- Okay, here we go, nice and
easy.

1287
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,147
- Ooo, I know a shortcut.

1288
01:02:32,149 --> 01:02:33,081
- What?

1289
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:37,252
Oh, my God, it's going so fast.

1290
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:39,888
Tree.

1291
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:45,260
Okay, anywhere around here,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1292
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:47,462
Okay.

1293
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:48,396
- Got it.

1294
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,198
How you doing?

1295
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,366
- Yeah, great.

1296
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:52,534
Never again.

1297
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:54,336
That's why I don't get on bikes.

1298
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:56,004
You're welcome, by the
way.

1299
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:59,141
Yes, for hurting me.

1300
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:00,876
- Hey, slow down.

1301
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,377
- Now's really not the time to
slow down.

1302
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,378
This is it.

1303
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,546
- Okay.

1304
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,047
- Four, five, six.

1305
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:06,982
- Ah.

1306
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:10,519
Looks familiar.

1307
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:13,088
- Yeah, just like the good old
days, huh?

1308
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,089
- Mmhmm.

1309
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:19,861
- So, who's this mystery couple?

1310
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:23,198
- Actually it's a friend, I
guess.

1311
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,250
- Oh, first date?

1312
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:27,301
- Yeah, we've been with
her talking for ages.

1313
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,804
- Mmm.

1314
01:03:28,806 --> 01:03:31,206
Who'd put their faith in you?

1315
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,910
- I mean, it's obviously
working.

1316
01:03:34,912 --> 01:03:36,411
- Mr. Porter?

1317
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,345
Miss.

1318
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:39,347
- Is that?

1319
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:40,482
- Yes, it is.

1320
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:43,985
- Oh, you look handsome.

1321
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,220
- Thank you, Miss.

1322
01:03:45,222 --> 01:03:46,154
- Zoe.

1323
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,222
- Zoe.

1324
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:49,291
- So, who's the lucky lady?

1325
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:53,028
- Oh, just someone from my old
work.

1326
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,996
From my corporate days.

1327
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,032
- Oh, that's exciting.

1328
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:59,101
- I'm a little nervous.

1329
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,169
- Oh, don't worry, it can't
go worse than it did with me.

1330
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,004
- Thanks, just standing here.

1331
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,940
Escott, everything's gonna be
fine.

1332
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:07,025
I made it very easy.

1333
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:09,109
Just remember, be a gentleman,
and treat her like a lady.

1334
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:10,312
- Got it.

1335
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:11,502
- Wow.

1336
01:04:11,503 --> 01:04:12,691
I wish you would have applied

1337
01:04:12,692 --> 01:04:13,880
some of that good advice to
yourself.

1338
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:16,518
Oh, burn.

1339
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,290
Yeah, like do what I say, not
what I do?

1340
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:24,159
That's what I should listen to.

1341
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:25,093
Right?
- Yeah.

1342
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:32,033
- Right, be a gentleman, be a
lady.

1343
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,069
Treat her like a lady.

1344
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:36,004
Yes, got it, thank you, Mr.
Porter.

1345
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:36,938
Zoe.

1346
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:40,508
- Well, okay, chop chop,
she's waiting for you.

1347
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,210
- Oh.

1348
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,645
- Escott.

1349
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:45,213
No weapons tonight.

1350
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,216
- Oh, no, no, I returned the
taser.

1351
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,086
It is way too dangerous.

1352
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:53,021
- Yeah.

1353
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,955
- I got an Airsoft pistol
instead, so I can stay protected

1354
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:59,094
on the job, and do
paintball in my free time.

1355
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:01,496
Double whammy.

1356
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,166
- This should be interesting.

1357
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:07,302
- Yeah, very interesting.

1358
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:09,237
Okay.

1359
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,172
- Let's go.

1360
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:12,624
- Yeah, we should go.

1361
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:14,075
Yeah, yeah, we should go, okay.

1362
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,043
- Good luck tonight.

1363
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:16,978
- Thank you, Miss Zoe.

1364
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,017
- So the trick is to take the
suction cup.

1365
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:22,918
- Mmhmm.

1366
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:25,587
There we go.

1367
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:27,521
Hold the letter, and then, place
it

1368
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:31,693
where you want it to go, just
like that.

1369
01:05:31,695 --> 01:05:35,964
And then, the trick is, with
a little twist of your wrist,

1370
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:38,166
lift the letter off the suction
cup.

1371
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:39,234
- Yeah, it looks easy.

1372
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:40,568
Here, give me the stick.

1373
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,304
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1374
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:44,439
- There you go.

1375
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,472
- So you--
- Take it there.

1376
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:46,975
- Grab the letter.

1377
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:48,343
Okay, got it.

1378
01:05:48,345 --> 01:05:49,644
- That's it, that's it.

1379
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:51,079
- And then,

1380
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:52,480
- And then hopefully place it.
- Like that?

1381
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:54,316
- Yeah, yeah.

1382
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:56,518
- It's not sticking.
- That's it, no, no.

1383
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,219
- Just finesse, just with the
wrist.

1384
01:05:58,221 --> 01:05:59,621
- Like that?
- Like a slight turn here,

1385
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,656
just a slight turn.

1386
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:02,590
- Perfect.

1387
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:07,662
Could have done it myself, you
know.

1388
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,632
- Yes, you could have, for sure.

1389
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,704
- We should get going,
she'll be here soon.

1390
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:16,638
- Yeah.

1391
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,113
- No, no, no, this can't be
happening.

1392
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,084
- Oh.
- Can't be happening.

1393
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:30,618
- Looking for this?

1394
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,522
- How?

1395
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:37,258
- You know, Escott is a really
great guy,

1396
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,328
but he is a terrible security
guard.

1397
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:42,731
- You're amazing.

1398
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:45,400
Come, come on.

1399
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:46,301
- Okay.

1400
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,404
Okay, here we go.

1401
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:57,746
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1402
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,415
- Here we are, in the theater.

1403
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:01,549
- The theater.

1404
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:05,353
- So, we're looking for 15, 14.

1405
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,289
- Oh.

1406
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:09,457
- Oh, after you.

1407
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:11,292
- Oh, well, thank you.

1408
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:12,460
- Yeah, okay.

1409
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:15,247
What does the next card say?

1410
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:18,033
- A movie you want to see,
jack and queen you got to be.

1411
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:22,170
- A movie you want to see,
jack and queen you got to be.

1412
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:23,204
- Exclamation point.

1413
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,773
- Exclamation point.

1414
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:26,374
- Mmhmm.

1415
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:28,710
- It's never gonna work.

1416
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,712
Jack and queen you
got to be.

1417
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:33,648
- Who thought up of
this crazy idea, anyway?

1418
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,316
- Oh, my new boss.

1419
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,087
Yeah, he's a very great man.

1420
01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:42,390
Very wise and gentle.

1421
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:48,063
I mean, not gentle, per se.

1422
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,666
- What is he even talking about.

1423
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:52,667
- Oh, yeah.

1424
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,671
And you're happier here than
when you were

1425
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,173
sitting behind the desk?

1426
01:07:58,175 --> 01:07:59,374
- Oh.

1427
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:03,111
- That is true, yeah, I confess.

1428
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:04,579
And then,

1429
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:07,382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1430
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,720
- Well, your new boss is very
creative.

1431
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:14,489
- Okay, maybe it wasn't the best
idea,

1432
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:18,259
but, you know, I'm just
a literary specialist.

1433
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,394
- I told you.

1434
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:21,596
Maybe we should give
him a hint or something?

1435
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,232
- And I caught him when he was
trying

1436
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:27,302
this whole thing out with
Miss Zoe the firs time.

1437
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:29,370
So, like, oops, my bad.

1438
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:30,705
- Really?
- Yeah.

1439
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,477
- Wow, so, you're telling me,
that if we're here tonight,

1440
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:38,213
it's a little bit because of
you.

1441
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,616
- We could definitely say that.

1442
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,385
It's a little bit because of me.

1443
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:49,657
- Well, back to work.

1444
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,493
- Right.
- Yeah.

1445
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:53,862
- Okay, I don't know where.

1446
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:55,563
- Wait.

1447
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:58,633
- Oh.

1448
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,236
Jackpot.

1449
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:02,504
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

1450
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:04,305
- What?

1451
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:07,542
- The name is Scott.

1452
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:08,476
Escott.

1453
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,613
- Boom.

1454
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:13,481
- I can't believe it.

1455
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:15,917
- So, Escott.
- Okay.

1456
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:20,822
- What do we do with these cards
now?

1457
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:24,209
- I don't know.

1458
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,694
Jack of spades, queen of
hearts, ace of diamonds.

1459
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,931
- Hey, what movie are we
gonna see tonight, anyway?

1460
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:32,534
- Oh no, I can't say that, it's
a secret.

1461
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:33,735
- Come on.

1462
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:35,504
- No.

1463
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,272
- Come on, am I gonna like it?

1464
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:42,644
- Well, okay, it's this
wonderful movie.

1465
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:46,648
It's about an elder man who
starts a new job, and he

1466
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:49,951
- Falls for the massage
therapist?

1467
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,624
- I love that movie.

1468
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:57,559
- Yeah.

1469
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:06,734
- When do we actually see it?

1470
01:10:08,438 --> 01:10:09,370
- I dunno.

1471
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:12,707
It's kind of a new concept.

1472
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,310
Maybe they're working out the
kinks.

1473
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:16,477
- Why have they stopped?

1474
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,479
- I dunno, maybe they're stuck?

1475
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:22,217
- Jack of spades, queen of
hearts, ace of diamonds.

1476
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:23,585
Wait a minute.

1477
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:24,819
Look.

1478
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:26,354
Your under seat.

1479
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:29,924
Oh.

1480
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,459
Under your seat.

1481
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:33,828
So.
- Oh.

1482
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,465
Oh.

1483
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:50,745
- You're a genius.

1484
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,781
No, honestly, that's amazing.

1485
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,283
- You know, people are pretty
intelligent,

1486
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:57,986
if you give them the benefit of
the doubt.

1487
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:01,923
Don't worry, you'll get there
someday, if you work at it.

1488
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:02,790
Thank you.

1489
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:04,325
So, what's next?

1490
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:09,697
- Well, the movie is
about an hour and a half.

1491
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:13,501
So, that gives you some
time to surprise me.

1492
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:21,442
- Do you think they forgot about
us?

1493
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,054
- Now, that's good popcorn.

1494
01:11:33,056 --> 01:11:36,724
- Oh, it's always better
when you make it yourself.

1495
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:44,865
- You know, I'm actually not
this easy.

1496
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:46,868
- Yeah, right.

1497
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,237
- No, no, to be honest,

1498
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,605
I actually wanted to show you my
new film.

1499
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:52,841
- Please, don't.

1500
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:54,075
- No, it's really good, I
promise you.

1501
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:56,978
It's about the guys who
live in the dope walk.

1502
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,913
You know, traffic lights.

1503
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:00,899
- Mmhmm.

1504
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,884
- The big bread hand, and his
friend, the little white guy.

1505
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:05,019
Oh, do you what you want.

1506
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:08,589
- No more festival films.

1507
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:11,693
- Not even at least one a month?

1508
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:13,061
- Year.

1509
01:12:13,063 --> 01:12:13,995
- Year?

1510
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:15,997
I'm a film connoisseur.

1511
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,332
It's my work.

1512
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,802
- We're ready, okay.

1513
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:25,340
You can start the movie now.

1514
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:26,074
Thanks.

1515
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:31,545
And now, for
our feature presentation.

1516
01:12:33,783 --> 01:12:35,883
Go low, deep voice, manly.

1517
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:40,521
- Now that you have this new
concept,

1518
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,924
you'll probably need a project
manager.

1519
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:44,759
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1520
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:47,061
Do you have any ideas?

1521
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:48,763
- I know a girl.

1522
01:12:48,765 --> 01:12:49,731
- Okay.

1523
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:57,405
- And her first mission
as project manager,

1524
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:01,542
is to pick a better film.

1525
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,844
- Oh.

1526
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:04,545
Yeah, yeah.

1527
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,547
I actually watched one the
other day, it's really good.

1528
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,816
The Girl with the Invisible
Violin.

1529
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:09,751
- Oh, really?

1530
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:11,152
- Really good.

1531
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:12,453
- Missed that one.

1532
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:13,721
- You should see it.

1533
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,559
Yeah, it has a really strong
female lead.

1534
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,594
- She sounds great.

1535
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:20,762
- Yeah, very great.

1536
01:13:20,764 --> 01:13:22,864
Lot of depth, lot of conviction.

1537
01:13:22,866 --> 01:13:24,465
- Mmm.

1538
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:38,079
- Her violin playing, a
little left to be desired.

1539
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,881
But, you know.

1540
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:42,583
- I'll have to see it.

1541
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:43,785
- Yeah.

1542
01:13:43,787 --> 01:13:44,836
It's great.

1543
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:45,886
- Sounds like my kind of film.

1544
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:46,888
- I think you'd like it.

1545
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:47,889
Super charming.

1546
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:48,923
- Witty?

1547
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:49,791
- Very.

1548
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:50,658
- Hilarious, probably.

1549
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,059
- A laugh aloud caper.

1550
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:54,662
I love a bit of fake violins.

1551
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,596
Who doesn't, really?

1552
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:56,697
Fake Yo-Yo Ma.

1553
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:57,565
Sounds quirky.

1554
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:58,433
Fake Bach.

1555
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,100
Fun.

1556
01:13:59,102 --> 01:13:59,934
Fake Mozart.

1557
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,469
Charming.

1558
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:04,872
Know any other
violinists?
