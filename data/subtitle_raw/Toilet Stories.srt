2
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,700
Herbert's here.

3
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,386
Hello.

4
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,270
Got money, Herbert?

5
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,988
Just bought some high-tech Japanese toilets.

6
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,511
Left-over stock.

7
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,064
They'll be a hit.

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,031
OK today. Money tomorrow. Double-meat.

9
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,426
Sure thing.

10
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,827
HERBERT TAPKEN
...is a man of principle

11
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,671
What's the problem, pussy?
- Nothing, man.

12
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,906
KEVIN AND TARKAN
...have big plans for today

13
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,231
Hi, sweetie.

14
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,229
I'm terribly stressed out.

15
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,343
You can't imagine.

16
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,388
PATRICIA SCHWACKE
...doesn't rely on luck alone

17
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,030
MARTIN ROLFES
...just wants to be left alone

18
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,542
No. I said 300 grams.

19
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,549
RENATE SCHOHUSEN
...won't let the wool be pulled over her eyes

20
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,181
My God.

21
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,910
Uschi, emergency.

22
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,465
DR. MAXIMILIAN DIETRICH
...is there when he's needed

23
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,829
OK, OK.

24
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm coming.

25
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,024
MR. JANSEN
...did just about everything right

26
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,741
CHARLOTTE VON LAHN
...can imagine more

27
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,624
MANFRED KASUNKE
...is looking forward to a day of enjoyment

28
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,146
Very good.

29
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,824
Another 1000 meters.

30
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,581
LONI NORDAHL
...wants lo be at the top of the podium

31
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,750
Very consistent, Loni.

32
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,146
Very good.

33
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,271
Especially on the last 400 meters.

34
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,423
Better than on Saturday.

35
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,510
How about...

36
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,670
we get two tenths faster per lap
as of tomorrow.

37
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,191
Three.

38
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,191
Three?

39
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,708
I can do at least three.

40
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,266
Fine.

41
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,383
Let's try it.

42
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,505
Tonight:

43
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,943
400 grams of pasta,
120 grams of lean poultry,

44
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,461
two apples and no chocolate.

45
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,546
And don't forget
your sports show interview.

46
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,023
Glad you're here, Ludmilla.
- Huh?

47
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,946
Our Anti-Doping friends.
- What?

48
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,502
A NADA acquaintance told me.

49
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,351
Kleinschmidt's coming.
- Oh, God.

50
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,071
What's wrong?

51
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,468
Kleinschmidt's coming.

52
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,790
Impossible.

53
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,310
I was checked two weeks ago.

54
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,582
Your European record on Saturday.

55
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,262
I said not to try so hard
on the final 50 meters.

56
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,950
But you didn't listen.

57
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,505
I tried.

58
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,704
They were the fastest of your career.
- It was the insulin.

59
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,308
We have 30 minutes, tops.

60
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,026
Have you taken anything since Saturday, Loni?

61
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,308
1,000 epo and a vial of clenbulerol.

62
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,264
As agreed, Doc.

63
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,188
38 to 17.

64
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,705
On sale this week: Rosi garden shears.
Make your yard look perfect this year.

65
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,069
A five-year warranty for only 14.95 Euros
at Honnom Construclion!

66
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,701
Hello?

67
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,901
Hello?

68
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,980
There aren't even
hooks in the toilets nowadays.

69
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,309
Is it made of cotton?

70
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,464
I mean your coat.

71
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,149
Beware of bringing that to the cleaner's.

72
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,911
I had one, too.
Bought it in Heidelberg in 1963.

73
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,828
I've taken it to the cleaner's
23 times since then.

74
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,108
It no longer even fits Werner,

75
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,991
and he's a lot smaller than me.

76
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,789
Sorry, but this is the staff restroom.

77
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,987
You're the nice young man

78
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,228
from the garden department.

79
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,263
I'm on my lunch break.

80
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,266
Have you ever been in Heidelberg?

81
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,228
I met my wife there.

82
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,270
You should go there some time.
To Heidelberg. It's worth it.

83
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,225
GOLD MEDAL CANDIDATES

84
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,143
But when people go on vacation nowadays,
most of them go as far away as possible.

85
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,228
America, Australia...

86
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,106
But it's so beautiful in Germany.

87
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,305
We always went

88
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,628
to the Bavarian Forest.

89
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,268
Every year, without exception.

90
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,426
But,

91
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,349
by now,

92
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,828
if you believe it or not,

93
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,065
I haven't been on vacation for years.

94
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,703
The obligations at home.

95
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,068
If only I'd known.

96
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,431
My God.

97
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,903
Do you have any toilet paper over there?

98
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,064
Do you have family?

99
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,063
I need some.

100
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,591
I asked if you have a family.

101
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,110
Yes, but I'm not married.

102
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,705
Children?

103
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,787
Two.
- Well then.

104
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,506
See?

105
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,180
You know about obligations.

106
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,346
Thanks.

107
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,661
I live with Werner.

108
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,541
Yeah, and now a situation has arisen

109
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,505
that may require our separation.

110
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,745
I don't really know

111
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,028
how to tell Werner that.

112
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,021
He has nobody but me.

113
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,222
"A situation has arisen?"
- I might have to go to prison.

114
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,547
What do you want from me?

115
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,943
I want to confess.

116
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,831
I want you to hear my confession.

117
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,904
Mrs. Schohusen?

118
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,102
My name's Herbert Tapken.
We talked on the phone yesterday.

119
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,948
Who? - It's concerning the brochure
for raising your husband's toilet seat.

120
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,423
I was in the neighborhood.
- I'm not prepared for visitors, Mr...

121
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,547
Tapken, I won't cause you any trouble, but
it's better to see your plumbing personally,

122
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,549
or I'd send you the wrong brochure.

123
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,983
Fine, if you're already here.
But lake off your shoes.

124
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,387
It's harder to vacuum at my age.

125
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,621
Of course, Mrs. Schohusen.

126
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,546
Nothing's better than sound technical advice.

127
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,142
Lots of people order online
and end up miserable.

128
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,588
It's a plumbing salesman for your toilet.

129
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,584
Calm down, Willi. I won't let anyone
like that palm something off on me.

130
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,905
Daisies.

131
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,547
Meadow daisies.

132
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,143
Here's the good old thing.

133
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,024
Washdown.

134
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,983
1970s.
- My Willi installed it himself back then.

135
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,511
Good work.

136
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,341
Some of my colleagues
could learn a thing or two from him.

137
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,430
My Willi always did it all himself at home.

138
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,067
Then all of a sudden...

139
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,181
Stop it, Mrs. Schohusen. My sister-in-law
had a stroke last year. She was 51.

140
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,148
I haven't eaten any meal since then.
- You don't eat meat anymore?

141
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,149
Because of the blood lipids.
- It wasn't the fat. I'm a good cook.

142
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,906
It can all add up, Mrs. Schohusen.

143
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,150
It was his blood pressure.
Have you seen the mosque on the corner?

144
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,186
Winkler Street.
Sure, I installed their plumbing.

145
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,150
Stunning building.

146
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,269
Very nice people.
- They're building a minaret. 30 meters high.

147
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,588
My Willi got so upset.

148
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,148
You're right, 30 meters is quite high,
Mrs. Schohusen.

149
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,066
But you called me
about the raised toilet seal.

150
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,268
The nurses recommended it.

151
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,905
The Washlet-G.

152
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,511
What's that?

153
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,306
The Mercedes of raised toilet seats.

154
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,549
The customer reactions
have been extraordinary.

155
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,267
I don't want a space ship.
I want a raised toilet seal.

156
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:26,508
I can sit Willi down on it,
but can't gel him off of the bowl again.

157
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,349
I'll be honest, Mrs. Schohusen.
- I hope so.

158
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,950
The body has to go.
The raised seals won't fit on it.

159
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,184
But my Willi installed the toilet himself.

160
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,142
Don't worry, I happen to have
an exhibit piece in my van.

161
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,151
You can pay me the wholesale price.

162
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,227
Right, you happen to have one here.

163
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,228
And I'd give you
a special price on the Washlet-G, too.

164
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,948
Young man, I've heard enough about
your Mercedes. I have to cook dinner.

165
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,385
Mrs. Schohusen?

166
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,784
I'll leave the brochure here for you.

167
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,909
Take it with you.

168
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,910
Have a nice evening, Mrs. Schohusen.

169
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,470
Awesome, man.

170
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,421
Look.

171
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,349
What was that?
- Mesut ...zil, man.

172
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,541
Stop, man.
- Why?

173
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,622
Are you gay or what, man?
- Calm down, man.

174
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,030
Know what I think?

175
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,466
He's gay.

176
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,302
Is he right?

177
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,388
Are you gay or what, huh?

178
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,988
Weren't you listening, man?

179
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,626
Tarkan asked you a question.

180
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,270
Don't got no respect?
You disrespecting me?

181
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,342
Are you antisocial or what?

182
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,826
Give us a smoke.

183
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,426
Sorry.

184
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,229
I don't smoke.
- What did you say, pops?

185
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,788
Yo, he just bumped into me.

186
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,069
Did you just bump into me or what?

187
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,190
You want trouble? You want trouble, huh?

188
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,189
You want some real trouble?

189
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,141
Are you a Nazi?

190
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,304
What now, dickhead?

191
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,707
Fucking Nazi.

192
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,106
You're taking a shower, dickface.

193
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,347
Hey, Nazi,

194
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,985
you stink.

195
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,791
He's done now.

196
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,546
It's his own fault, the Nazi cunt.

197
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,621
Kung fu and shit, right?
- You think you can do kung fu or what?

198
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,026
Sure, man.

199
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,421
Yo, that's gay shit. Watch.

200
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,631
That's kung fu.

201
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,826
Cool, man. Kung fu and shit, yeah?

202
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,310
But you forgot something.
- What'? - This Mr. Miyagi technique.

203
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,264
Wash on, wash off!

204
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,986
Gentlemen?

205
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,946
You want more?

206
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,510
Son of a bitch.

207
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,221
I don't know why Michi
just gave away our Kandinsky either.

208
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,548
For just 200,000.

209
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,502
Yes.

210
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,500
For some charity. Children or disabled
in Africa, what do I know'?

211
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,746
Charlotte?

212
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,421
Patricia.

213
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,141
Sweetie, I'll call you later, OK?

214
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,341
Sweetie!

215
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,949
It's so nice to see you.

216
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,750
Yes, really nice.
- It's been an eternity.

217
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,750
At your goose dinner.

218
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,744
Three or four months ago.

219
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,981
Exactly.

220
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,147
How's Constantin?

221
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,463
I wanted to gel in touch with you,
but I was so busy.

222
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,662
Our vacation home in Provence.

223
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,145
Then we were skiing in Aspen,
and this and that. You know the drill.

224
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,064
Sure, no problem.

225
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,666
You can't go to St. Moritz anymore.

226
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,227
It was such impudence last time:

227
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,663
We arrived and our suite
had been given to guess whom?

228
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,271
Russians.

229
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,387
Russians.

230
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,709
Can you imagine? They're everywhere now.
- Yes...

231
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,671
you indicated that last time, loo.

232
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,071
Sweetie,

233
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,746
I'm about to have a photo shoot for the press

234
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,108
for donating our Kandinsky,

235
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,067
but I need to confess something.

236
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,951
Well, you know.

237
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,300
I haven't called you
because I was so embarrassed last time.

238
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,028
Embarrassed?
- Well...

239
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,627
I bought magnificent geese
that were massaged for two years

240
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,948
and then Michi invited such people.

241
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,145
I was so ashamed.
Like the guy in jeans who Michi invited.

242
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,145
In jeans!

243
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,061
You mean Reiner'? - Exactly. He said his
father's an electrician in front of everyone.

244
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,749
Incredible.
I'll invite the caretaker next time, too.

245
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,143
His father's a carpenter.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

246
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,467
I found him quite likable.
- If you're into chimpanzees.

247
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,549
His chest hair was incredible.
I thought it was a toupee.

248
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,386
We spent some time together after dinner.

249
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,027
He was all charged up. Maybe that's why
I thought his dad was an electrician!

250
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,622
It was just a one-night stand.

251
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,664
As far as I'm concerned.

252
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,547
He still sends me texts.

253
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,141
Oh?

254
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,586
Well,

255
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,102
I should've known
you'd be uptight about it.

256
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,625
What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

257
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,309
But I don't regret it.

258
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,630
So... what have you been up to lately?

259
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,186
Working.

260
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,350
Working?

261
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,381
Surely you don't need to!
What does Constantin say about that?

262
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,305
Nothing.

263
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,790
Six weeks till the games.

264
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,343
We need a world record for gold.

265
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,184
No kidding, Ludmilla.

266
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,305
I told you we should send Loni
to a training camp in the Andes or somewhere.

267
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,742
Like all the other top athletes.

268
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,229
Never mind. We're here now and we'll fix it.

269
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,822
Dilution?

270
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,190
We'll manage, dear.

271
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,190
Manage what?
- To win gold. Your gold medal.

272
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,506
This is my life!

273
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,225
We all know that.

274
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,185
You're number one!
- Let's keep cool.

275
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,150
The anti-gold guys
are breathing down our necks.

276
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,743
And how?
- Substitute urine.

277
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,261
That's our only chance.
- It won't work.

278
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,023
Kleinschmidt busted Zimmermann
just last week.

279
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,506
That heptathlete...

280
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,987
Kleinschmidt's focused on the gold.

281
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,150
She'll stop at nothing to make headlines.

282
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,950
I've earned this.

283
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,471
Of course.

284
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,381
It's about a level playing field.

285
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,746
How did she do it?

286
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,823
Did Zimmennann hide the urine
in her vagina? - Yes.

287
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,105
We won't do that then.

288
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,748
We'll use the men's method.

289
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,019
96 to 8.

290
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,146
96 to 8.

291
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,142
My wife and daughter.

292
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,984
Sweet, aren't they'?

293
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,668
I've carried that picture around with me
for 30 years.

294
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,020
You know,

295
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,229
I normally picked them up in the car

296
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,745
when they'd been at Aunt Irmgard's,
but I was playing Skat that night.

297
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,985
Skat was usually on Wednesdays,

298
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,741
but that week was different.

299
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,309
So they look the bus.

300
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,101
So I...

301
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,740
came home and no one was there,

302
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,184
so I called Aunt Irmgard and she said...

303
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,664
"They took the bus

304
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,908
at 8:15 pm."

305
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,671
The next morning, the police came

306
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,949
into my office.

307
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,149
I'd specifically told them

308
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,550
to take the 7:47 PM bus,
while it was still light.

309
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,381
They always took the 7:47 bus.

310
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,310
That Heise guy,

311
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,470
they nabbed him soon after that, thank God.

312
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,942
Married, two kids,

313
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,830
a respectable job.

314
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,221
"The Beast of Barsbüttel."

315
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,622
Maybe you've heard of him.

316
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,189
They had to let him go
due to a lack of evidence.

317
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,821
Everyone knew. Even the judge said,

318
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,062
"Heise did it."

319
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,391
Can you imagine?

320
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,586
Yes,

321
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,102
it was a difficult time for me.

322
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,309
Mr. Rolfes to gardening.

323
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,947
The worst part is,
people treat you like an outcast.

324
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,269
They cross the street
as if you had cholera.

325
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,105
As if I were contagious.

326
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,705
As if I'd done it.

327
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,142
If it wasn't for Günther,

328
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,505
who knows?

329
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,946
Günther?

330
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,542
Günther Griegoleit
from Griegoleit Driving School.

331
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,182
He was always there for me.

332
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,671
Unfortunately, he later moved to Bielefeld.

333
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,308
What?
- Griegoleit.

334
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,901
He moved to Bielefeld.

335
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,306
What a shame.

336
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,061
Right.
- Mr. Rolfes to gardening, Mr. Rolfes.

337
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,066
Listen, I...

338
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,829
I'm very sorry...

339
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,511
about everything...

340
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,989
I don't mean to be rude...

341
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,227
Mr. Rolfes to gardening.

342
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,270
That's Werner.

343
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,945
We were celebrating his 60th.

344
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,622
A few years ago now, too.

345
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,990
Where's that?

346
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,825
At home.

347
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,630
In the cellar.

348
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,029
Are those bars?

349
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,420
What'

350
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,266
Here...

351
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,188
in the foreground.
The poles. They look like bars.

352
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,745
Yes.

353
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,506
It doesn't really concern me, but...

354
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,267
who is this Werner?

355
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,910
Werner Heise, the "Beast of Barsbüttel."

356
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,305
I mean,

357
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,708
once he confessed,

358
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,948
I began calling him Werner.
Earlier, I'd called him Mr. Heise

359
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,780
He lives in your cellar?
- Yes.

360
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,831
Since when?

361
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,308
October 3rd, '79.

362
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,150
Our anniversary.

363
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,785
We always drink a beer to celebrate.

364
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,824
A nice dark ale.

365
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,022
Yes,

366
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,263
it was a bit strange for me at first, too.

367
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,991
But over time...

368
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,185
Humans are creatures of habit.

369
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,791
You've held him captive for 30 years?

370
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,986
It's no easy job, let me tell you.

371
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,027
But,

372
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,148
I don't want to complain.

373
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,545
We've really settled in since then.

374
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,026
And nobody's ever missed him?

375
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,427
What?

376
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,781
Heise.

377
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,546
I'd prefer if you call him "Werner."

378
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,071
No one's ever missed Werner?

379
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,986
Everyone hoped he'd disappear. When he
was gone they finally felt safe again.

380
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,705
That's how it was.

381
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,344
What do you think?

382
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,350
Think of what?

383
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,266
That I'm protecting people from Werner?

384
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,901
That he can't hurt anyone else?

385
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,550
It's vigilantism.

386
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,663
And if Werner were to...

387
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,908
I mean, you have two kids.

388
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,148
Both healthy, I hope.

389
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,591
Yes, I...

390
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,825
I mean,

391
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,910
sure, if...

392
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,148
he really did it, then...

393
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,944
That's lovely.

394
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,060
What?

395
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,222
What?

396
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,831
What's lovely?

397
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,950
Well, that you understand.

398
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,911
You know,

399
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,342
that means a lot to me.

400
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,263
I never said I understand.

401
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,981
Not directly,

402
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,945
but you did between the lines.

403
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,541
Werner's got it good at my place:

404
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,181
TV,

405
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,461
bathroom,

406
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,469
heating, kitchenette.

407
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,703
Built it all myself.

408
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,149
Sounds great.

409
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,461
Yes.

410
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,185
I thought so, too.

411
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,382
Until two days ago.

412
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,990
Two days ago?

413
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,946
Yes?

414
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,508
Yes, it's Mr. Tapken again,
from Tapken Bathrooms.

415
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,626
What now?

416
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,027
Please step aside,

417
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,145
Mrs. Schohusen.

418
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,901
You can't just...
- You know, Mrs. Schohusen.

419
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,667
I feel like
you got the wrong impression of me.

420
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,228
This is unacceptable, Mr. Tapken.
- I'd like to apologize,

421
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,149
Mrs. Schohusen.

422
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,830
My motto is always:

423
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,462
"Only the best for my customers
and a bit less if need be."

424
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,947
I should've told you that.

425
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,588
That's why we got our wires crossed.

426
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,024
I'm sorry.

427
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,666
I'll give you the exhibit piece.

428
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,389
Every kind of raised seat fits,
even the cheapest.

429
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,467
You should leave now, Mr. Tapken.

430
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,786
Good,

431
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,065
Mrs. Schohusen.

432
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,584
It's not the money, Mr. Tapken.
Willi's moving into a home soon.

433
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,391
Into a home?

434
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,150
A nursing home.

435
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,627
He moves in six weeks.

436
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,148
Then he must go, I understand.

437
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,702
You don't think I want him gone?

438
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,424
I'm not inferring that, Mrs. Schohusen.
You have to know what's best.

439
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,830
His nurse only comes twice a day
for 15 minutes.

440
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,148
That's the thanks you get

441
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,264
for paying insurance all these years.

442
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,303
The way this looks,
you have no choice anyway.

443
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,787
Willi can't even shower here.

444
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,581
Even though
great home-care setups do exist.

445
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,790
Our healthcare policies are scandalous.

446
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,025
I don't understand politics at all.
- Who does nowadays?

447
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,107
My Willi was interested in politics before
it became too much for his blood pressure.

448
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,300
Is it really necessary for male politicians
to bring their boyfriends on state visits?

449
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:03,743
That's how the world is these days,
Mrs. Schohusen.

450
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,102
It's terrible in those nursing homes.

451
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,586
What do you mean?

452
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,107
Just what kind of men do you think
are drawn to this female profession?

453
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,142
God!

454
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,068
That's how it is nowadays.

455
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,785
But nurses in general are paid so little,

456
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,387
you're lucky if they even speak German.

457
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,790
Willi already had a stroke
because of that minaret and everything.

458
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,309
The doctor said
the fat was mostly to blame.

459
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,064
I'm a good cook.

460
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,429
You have to believe me.

461
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,068
Of course, Mrs. Schohusen.

462
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,300
Even so,

463
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,231
Willi still has six weeks here at home.

464
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,660
That counts, too.

465
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,584
He should be comfortable on the toilet.
We can do that with a cheap model.

466
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,020
That'd be lovely.

467
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,428
I know how much those homes cost.

468
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,146
If I knew Willi was moving out soon,

469
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,709
I would've never suggested the Washlet-G.

470
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,670
You'd only do that if you didn't want
strangers taking care of him.

471
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,591
I don't want that.
- I know. I know,

472
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,226
Mrs. Schohusen.

473
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,789
I'll cross my fingers

474
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,742
they let you keep the house a bit longer,
considering all the costs you'll soon have.

475
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,071
We still have our savings, Mr. Tapken.
If you help us,

476
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,705
Willi might not have to go at all.

477
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,586
First, an enema.

478
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,147
Bring me some muesli bars, please.

479
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,508
Ludmilla? A coffee for me.

480
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,664
Three tablespoons of sugar and no milk,
if you'd be so kind. - Sure, doctor.

481
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,345
We'll place the urine in your intestine.

482
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,990
First, we need to flush it out to ensure

483
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,111
it won't be expelled by a bowel movement.

484
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,748
That'll also prevent
E.coli bacteria from contaminating...

485
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,661
the sample.

486
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,749
They check for that too?

487
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,468
Count on it.

488
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,548
Don't underestimate our enemy.

489
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,590
I suggest

490
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,942
you go and kneel by the toilet.

491
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,983
The enema can work fast.

492
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,991
OK, Doc.

493
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,706
Pants down?

494
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,346
After your little refreshment, gentlemen,
please allow me to introduce myself.

495
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,342
They call me, "Le Dude."

496
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:20,945
A "stage name," if you will,
that they gave lo me in Algeria.

497
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,705
Légion d'honneur.

498
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,271
Foreign legion.

499
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,781
That was long ago.

500
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,421
I'll kill you, man.
- Not likely.

501
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,306
Since only one of you, only one,

502
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,629
will be leaving this room alive today.

503
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,104
I prefer to work with

504
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,547
objects from everyday life.

505
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,710
Commodities

506
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,149
that can be purchased
in any ordinary supermarket.

507
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,983
Commodities that can be found
in this ordinary bag, for example.

508
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,702
Which you so carelessly threw
into the corner earlier.

509
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,585
Shut your mouth, Nazi!

510
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,748
Let me be clear:

511
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,068
I have no prejudices,

512
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,423
neither religious, social, nor any other.

513
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,348
I treat every person with their all due...

514
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,943
respect.
- What kind of old motherfucker are you?

515
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,710
Fucking bastard.

516
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,987
Bastard.

517
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,586
Fuck, man.

518
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,546
Gentlemen,

519
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,702
I'm now going to strip your feet.

520
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,989
I must say, messieurs: You've got talent.

521
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,664
You're as ruthless

522
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,984
as you are consistent.

523
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,741
Nevertheless,

524
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,908
today I'll be conveying to you
that our common inclinations

525
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,904
and a certain degree of style and class

526
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,021
need not be mutually exclusive.

527
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,787
No.

528
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,826
We now need silence, gentlemen.

529
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,705
Absolute silence.

530
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,465
Silence, s'il vous plaît.

531
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,585
You're about to enjoy

532
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,023
a sample from my area of special expertise.

533
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,700
An amuse-gueule,

534
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,341
so to speak.

535
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,509
I apologize in advance

536
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,182
for the smell of burning flesh.

537
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,349
If you're not used to it,

538
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,384
the smell can be slightly nauseating.

539
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,548
He still sends you text messages?

540
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,348
Constantin? Why would he?

541
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,151
Reiner.

542
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,065
Oh, him.

543
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,347
I must've made an impression on him.

544
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,587
But tell me,

545
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,227
what actually brings you
to this charity auction?

546
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,143
I like a photo by Sophie Calle
that's on auction.

547
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,421
Really?

548
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,702
Maybe you can get it cheap.

549
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,511
Our Kadinsky only went for 200,000.

550
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,742
I mean it's for a good cause, right?

551
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,740
Despite the press,

552
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,347
I think it's good you came.

553
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,271
That's in the paper?

554
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,990
Strange.

555
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,468
Michi and I agreed
not to let that news spread.

556
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,144
What do you mean?

557
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,389
The pregnancy. What else?

558
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,341
You're pregnant?

559
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,229
I though you knew.

560
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,026
From the newspaper?

561
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,709
No, I didn't know that.

562
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,150
I should actually read Michi the riot act,

563
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,270
but because he's wanted a child for so long,
it's understandable.

564
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,385
Well, at least I'm prepared
for the paparazzi out there now.

565
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,144
It gets better though.

566
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,148
Michi proposed to me.

567
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,181
Congratulations. You'd wanted that.

568
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,068
In front of his Japanese business friends.
Can you imagine? Incredibly sweet.

569
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,301
Listen:

570
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,986
Entrée was Kobe beef carpaccio.

571
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:59,390
Their legs are broken at birth
so they can't go hurting themselves.

572
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,506
Suddenly, Michi stood up
and festively clinked his wine glass.

573
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,942
Everyone stopped eating, of course.

574
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,824
He looked around sternly,

575
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,747
and asked me to be his wife.

576
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,945
Can you imagine all the Japanese faces?
They must've thought Michi would sign a deal.

577
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,542
It was so romantic.

578
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,382
And the dinner?
You could buy a small car for that price.

579
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,183
Excuse me, can't you see
we're having a conversation?

580
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,106
Yes, you. Can't you do that later?

581
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,427
Bye.

582
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,182
Sweetie,

583
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,271
you know what I just realized?
You have to be my maid of honor.

584
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,190
Me?
- I can picture it.

585
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,945
What a night it'll be.

586
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,188
You and Constantin at our table.

587
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,462
Constantin and I are over.
- Over?

588
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,500
You mean...?

589
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,782
Did he walk out on you?

590
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,706
Sweetie, come here.

591
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,982
Don't worry. Everyone knew
Constantin doesn't miss a trick.

592
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,028
Cosmetic improvements alone
won't cut it here,

593
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,745
to be perfectly honest.

594
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,711
I don't want you to get your hopes up.

595
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,071
The main valve?

596
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,589
Mrs. Schohusen, would you be so kind
and hand me my briefcase, please?

597
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,627
It's not that
I wouldn't like to sell you anything,

598
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,626
but in the end,
optimal care must be guaranteed.

599
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,942
That's my responsibility.

600
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,141
Now.

601
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,745
Let's see.

602
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,821
So...

603
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,421
Lead piping.

604
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,185
That makes sense.

605
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,541
What makes sense?

606
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,388
Well, I'm no doctor,

607
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,309
and I don't want to go
making assumptions.

608
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,346
But you notice things over the years.

609
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,750
Just like how they fooled everyone
about asbestos for years.

610
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,631
You think the lead caused his stroke?

611
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,669
I was starting to worry
it was the fatty food,

612
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,908
although I only ever cooked

613
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,029
so well for my Willi.

614
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,070
You don't need to blame yourself anymore.

615
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,623
Be honest, Mr. Tapken.

616
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,063
How much would it cost
to have Willi stay here?

617
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,021
A handicap-accessible shower

618
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,984
and lead piping replacements

619
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,309
would cost almost exactly 7,500 Euros.

620
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,501
Additionally,

621
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,348
there'd be a raised toilet seal

622
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,022
with support rail,
which start at 3,200 Euros.

623
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,467
That's nearly 11 ,000 Euros.

624
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,465
Which is why, Mrs. Schohusen,
I can't help you any further.

625
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,581
Maybe there's enough in our bank book.

626
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,101
Well,

627
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,502
shrouds have no pockets anyway.

628
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,749
Quite true, quite true,

629
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,750
Mrs. Schohusen.

630
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,111
If you're serious about it,
Mrs. Schohusen...

631
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,667
then...

632
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,744
I'll have to show you...

633
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,590
the "Washlet-G"

634
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,828
just one last time.

635
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,901
Heated seat, hot air fan,
ozone-deodorizer, massage function,

636
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,151
programmable water jets,
auto-flushing, auto-lid opener,

637
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,830
and a memory chip

638
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,068
that records the limes of use.

639
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,507
That's just...
- And here's the kicker:

640
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,907
For a small extra fee,

641
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,741
the Washlet-G
comes with a start-up pack for seniors.

642
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,900
Catch words: "medical sensors."

643
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,343
Blood sugar levels
can be calculated in the urine.

644
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,511
Pulse, blood pressure and fat levels
can all be measured

645
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,581
and sent directly over the Internet
to the family doctor.

646
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,111
We don't have Internet.

647
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,184
Don't worry, Mrs. Schohusen.

648
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,988
My brother-in-law has a little company.
It'll all be activated within a week.

649
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,389
How much is this model?

650
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,429
Naturally, I'll give you

651
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,144
a 15% discount, Mrs. Schohusen.

652
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,629
With the Washlet-G,
it would cost just 18,137 Euros,

653
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,427
including sales tax.
- We don't have that much, Mr. Tapken.

654
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,670
We can easily solve that
with a credit from our principal bank.

655
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,545
All included.

656
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,750
Willi always took care of things like this.

657
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,988
Of course,
you don't have to take the Washlet-G.

658
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,662
But,

659
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,749
if that was my wife,

660
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,741
I wouldn't want to deprive her of it.

661
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,742
You know what? I'll go get Willi.

662
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,505
You can explain it all to him.

663
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,180
Mrs. Schohusen,

664
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,946
all the fuss might be too much for him,

665
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,790
for his blood pressure.

666
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,349
Nonsense. Willi enjoys having visitors, loo.

667
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,911
E-coli bacteria often make their way

668
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,144
into the urethra and bladder,
causing infections.

669
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,984
Particularly in women.

670
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,311
The female urethra is relatively short.

671
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:44,467
But inflammatory cells
should be present in the urine, too.

672
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,027
If not...
- I'll be suspected.

673
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,148
I saw your new commercial.

674
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,106
The sandwich spread.
- "Marziponi?"

675
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,386
"With Marziponi, gold for Loni!"
- It tastes revolting. - I figured.

676
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:03,261
The muesli bars.
- Great, she's to eat them immediately.

677
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:08,423
"Holzknecht's mass movements"
occur twice a day in the large intestine.

678
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,751
They're triggered
by an expansion of the duodenum

679
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,347
after we ingest food or liquids.

680
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,663
Eating now will prevent such movements
from occurring at the wrong moment,

681
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,711
causing the reservoir to slip out of place.

682
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,228
Good, Loni.

683
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,504
We're nearly done.

684
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,346
It's pushing.

685
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,665
I have to go.
- Do whatever you think is right...

686
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,351
but please, let me finish.

687
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,586
I haven't told you everything yet.

688
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,705
What else is there?

689
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,590
The most important part.

690
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,270
The reason for my confession.

691
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,064
Griegoleit did it.

692
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,230
What?
- Günther Griegoleit

693
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,747
from Griegoleit Driving School.

694
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,187
The one who moved to Bielefeld.

695
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,026
Until two days ago, I didn't know they could
use DNA to solve cold cases, either.

696
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,385
Griegoleit of all people.

697
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,025
But you said that Heise...

698
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,341
Werner.

699
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,069
That Werner confessed.

700
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,104
You know what I think?

701
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,431
Werner lied.

702
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,982
Don't get me wrong.

703
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,144
I don't want to badmouth Werner.

704
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,150
And maybe it was my fault.

705
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,146
I said it again and again:

706
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,581
"Heise,

707
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,262
if you finally tell the truth,

708
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,106
you can live here in comfort.

709
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,387
If you don't,

710
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,106
then we have a problem."

711
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,706
Eventually, he came to understand that

712
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,704
and, after he confessed,

713
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,705
our relationship improved overnight.

714
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,381
Then I bought him the TV.

715
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,068
And every Sunday we have

716
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,984
Kasseler pork with sauerkraut,

717
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,625
and pudding.

718
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,668
"Kasseler pork with sauerkraut."
- Every Sunday. His favorite dish.

719
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,389
You could even say

720
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,464
a kind of friendship has developed.

721
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,789
Crazy, right?

722
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,424
Can I have it back, Father?
- What?

723
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,346
The photo. Can I have it back?

724
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,062
Little Marcel has lost his mommy.
Please pick him up at the Info Center.

725
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,428
And have you talked to...

726
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,547
Have you talked to Werner about...

727
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,744
this DNA evidence?

728
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,590
I think it's best he doesn't find out.

729
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,342
Excuse me?
- I wasn't sure, but...

730
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,143
now that you've heard my confession,

731
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,346
I see more clearly.

732
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,941
Wait.

733
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,422
I think you should let him go.

734
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,583
Werner is 72.

735
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,229
If I let him go, I'll go to jail.

736
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,622
Who'll take care of him then?

737
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,783
Will you?

738
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,266
No, but...

739
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,982
there are people who deal with these things.

740
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,540
I mean,

741
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,061
people who know what they're doing.

742
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,231
Surely it...

743
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,466
concerns the whole of society.

744
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,226
I really think
you should consider freeing him.

745
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,266
Hear me?

746
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:15,669
Are you still there?

747
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,145
We now come to...

748
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,270
disinfection.

749
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,105
L'eau-de-vie alisier d'Alsace.

750
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,306
Hawthorn brandy from Alsace.

751
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,907
The French appreciate pleasure.

752
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,542
I learned that there.

753
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,428
42% by volume.

754
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,989
A feast for the senses.

755
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:10,785
You see, gentlemen,

756
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,069
practicing altruism is also part of my job.

757
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,669
The medical side of my work

758
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,304
was always a joy.

759
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,225
As a young man, I wanted to become a doctor
before dedicating myself...

760
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,429
to a higher calling.

761
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,024
I was your age.

762
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,549
You have something to say?

763
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,828
We're really sorry.

764
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,228
We're so sorry. We won't...

765
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,424
do it again, I swear...

766
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,543
Gentlemen, you surprise me.

767
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,225
I'm no educator.

768
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,142
I'm not here to teach you,

769
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,706
get revenge

770
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,068
or make moral judgments.

771
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,910
I'm a sadist.

772
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,184
Your pain is my pleasure. That's all.

773
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,426
You of all people will understand that.

774
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,428
Right?

775
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,021
Although you're from a generation

776
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,951
whose approach to pain

777
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,709
tends to be rather more like fast food
than Nouvelle Cuisine.

778
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,390
But let's not get lost
in overly philosophical reflections.

779
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,147
Let's rather turn our attention

780
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,708
to the things for which

781
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,949
we've gathered here today.

782
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:52,344
I just recently bought these rose shears
in the garden department of a hardware store.

783
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,911
Gentlemen?

784
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,785
What are you doing here?
This bathroom is closed.

785
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,385
Forgive me.

786
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,230
My prostate.

787
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,748
We're looking for two juveniles.
- Between 17 and 18. A German and a Turk.

788
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,631
I haven't seen anything.

789
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,549
What's that smell?

790
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,024
I fear that was me. Veal roulade with celery.

791
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,511
Those your things?

792
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,225
Yes, why?

793
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,384
Finish up here.

794
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,908
I'm removing the enema.

795
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,624
Your coffee, Doctor.
- Thank you, Ludmilla. Very kind.

796
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,146
Filter coffee?

797
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,345
It's good, Ludmilla.

798
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,984
Is it hot enough?

799
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,421
Spot on.

800
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,105
Enough sugar?
- Perfect.

801
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,784
Normally used for men.

802
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,701
Reservoir.

803
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,547
Outlet.

804
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,263
Are you on medication?

805
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:11,510
Any illnesses?
Kidney problems? Liver disease?

806
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,107
Inherited conditions? Metabolic problems?
- No.

807
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,985
We need your urine.

808
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,420
150 ml.

809
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,951
Quick.

810
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,384
It's about to get serious.

811
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,302
I'll tell you what we'll do.

812
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,147
What now?

813
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,470
What do you mean?

814
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,304
All alone?

815
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,824
I'm not alone.
- You have a new boyfriend?

816
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,669
What does he do professionally?
- Children's furniture.

817
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,110
That's...

818
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,745
great!

819
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,787
One second. I have to...

820
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,831
Honey!

821
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,742
I thought you were playing golf.

822
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,751
It's sweet of you to think of me anyway.

823
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,380
Sure.

824
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,787
You know I'm being careful.

825
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,627
Guess who I've just met. Charlotte.

826
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,587
Did you know that she and Constantin...

827
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,147
You knew? And did you know...

828
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,424
You knew that, too?

829
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,145
With Reiner?

830
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,261
Oh.

831
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,261
Yes...

832
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,942
Charlotte also said...

833
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,626
there's something about us in the paper.

834
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,670
Honey, can we talk later?

835
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,342
You've gotten me
into an incredibly awkward situation.

836
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:42,789
I'll call you later.
I have lo sort things out here.

837
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,826
You know...

838
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,345
the text messages from Reiner...

839
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,185
that happened a bit longer ago

840
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,587
than you might've assumed earlier.

841
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,909
Hey, if your Reiner makes kids' furniture
maybe he could...

842
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,823
make some for us.

843
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,261
I'm sure he'll send you a catalog.

844
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,984
He even has a catalog? That's great!

845
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:27,385
Here's his card.

846
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:30,026
And his business is OK?

847
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:34,501
What?

848
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,108
He owns Captain Kiddies?

849
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,746
They have 300 stores.
That's not a carpenter's.

850
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,940
You got mixed up
because his dad's a carpenter.

851
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,907
Weird, he didn't say.

852
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,302
Anyway. It doesn't matter.

853
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,191
So what did it say in the paper?

854
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,667
Michi sounded strange on the phone.

855
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,143
Read it yourself.

856
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,308
Sounds intriguing.

857
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,188
"Hellweg Pharma goes bust.

858
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,747
Managing Director,
Hans-Michael Nässer-Vonnwinkel

859
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,510
files for insolvency."

860
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,021
My God. How embarrassing.

861
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,147
And now I'm meant to pose for photos?

862
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:27,389
They'll think,
"Our poor cousin from back east is here."

863
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,268
Hans-Michael? It's me.

864
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,661
You didn't want to worry me? What a joke.

865
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,462
Nobody's ever done this to me.

866
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,061
Have you any idea what I'm going through?

867
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,143
They'll roast me alive.

868
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:52,909
No, don't come here. Never come again, OK?

869
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,107
I can't.

870
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,069
No, I won't listen.

871
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,990
You should've thought about that earlier.

872
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,351
Come on, Willi.
Mr. Tapken wants to show you something.

873
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,065
Don't get worked up, Willi. That was just...

874
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,945
the old floor lamp. Stupid thing!

875
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,546
There, and let's go see...

876
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,144
Mr. Tapken.

877
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,745
That's it.

878
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,062
Yes. Good. There.

879
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,945
The door...

880
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,421
There.

881
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,144
That's Mr. Tapken.

882
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,189
From Tapken Bathrooms.

883
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:47,629
He wants to help us
so you can slay here.

884
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:52,107
Hello, Mr. Schohusen.

885
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,627
Well...

886
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:58,944
Go on, Mr. Tapken.

887
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:02,064
Willi understands much more than you think.

888
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,588
Like your wife said,

889
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,908
the main thing

890
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,110
is to improve

891
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,111
your quality of life...

892
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,227
Well, we thought...

893
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,427
I'll give you that toilet for free
because the attachments won't fit on yours.

894
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:25,544
What about that Chinese model
you have on sale?

895
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,104
It's a direct line to our doctor.
In case something happens, Willi.

896
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,982
Mr. Tapken's brother-in-law will sort it out.
- Sure.

897
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,786
But...

898
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,942
Your wife and I already

899
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,461
discussed the Washlet-G

900
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,142
from Japan.
- With a heated seat so you're nice and warm.

901
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,342
One of the model's...

902
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,390
many features.

903
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:56,341
And Mr. Tapken
will sort out the bank credit for us.

904
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,542
I assure you, Mr. Schohusen:

905
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:02,381
It's all the very best...

906
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,060
Asian...

907
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:09,183
workmanship. - Then Mr. Tapken
will sell us a new shower and pipes,

908
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,623
so we don't poison ourselves with the lead.
- Like I said,

909
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:14,584
I'm not a doctor...

910
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,187
I can't...

911
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,623
If only we'd known sooner. Right, Willi?

912
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:25,187
The doctor said it was the fatty food.
But I always cooked so well for you.

913
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,426
Know what, Mr. Tapken? I'll go and see

914
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:32,543
how much is in our savings book.

915
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,301
Mrs. Schohusen, that's...

916
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,464
You can...

917
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,261
Well.

918
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,147
Like I was saying to your wife:

919
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:58,621
great work.

920
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,464
Really great work.

921
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:08,985
Mr. Schohusen.

922
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,788
If I may, Mr. Schohusen?

923
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:23,387
Everything will be sorted soon,

924
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,901
Mr. Schohusen.

925
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:31,023
You alright, Mr. Schohusen?

926
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,980
Mrs. Schohusen?

927
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:41,626
I think you should...
- Just a moment.

928
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,910
Oh my God.

929
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:32,387
Wetting your hair with these precious drops

930
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,142
is a sign of my respect.

931
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,021
I hope you appreciate that.

932
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,146
Alors,

933
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,591
flambé..

934
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,830
A votre santé.

935
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,670
As I mentioned,

936
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:21,148
only one of you will leave this room alive.

937
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,110
However, I don't presume to play God.

938
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:31,461
That'd be foolhardy and wouldn't
do Him justice. It's up to you, gentlemen...

939
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,668
to make this decision.

940
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,147
I advise you not to chicken out.

941
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:43,549
Otherwise I'll use
this exquisite French liquid

942
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,822
to inflame every hair

943
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:47,425
on your heads.

944
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:04,508
Gentlemen, I thank you in advance
for the wonderful day you've granted me.

945
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,702
Un, deux, trois,

946
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:16,700
on y va!

947
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:19,111
Gentlemen.

948
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:25,859
This is for the substitute urine.
After that stupid incident

949
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:29,342
This is for the substitute urine.
After that stupid incident

950
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,147
with the heptathlete,
we can't place it in your vagina.

951
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:38,028
But Kleinschmidt watches you urinating
while keeping an eye on your hands,

952
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,547
so you couldn't open it
with a fingernail anyway.

953
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:43,702
Kleinschmidt has no shame.

954
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:45,461
Go on.

955
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:50,228
Many inject the substitute urine
into the athlete's bladder with a catheter.

956
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,105
That's unhygienic,
so we'll use the men's method.

957
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:56,471
The reservoir.

958
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,708
When it's full, we can't insert it,

959
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,705
hence the catheter.

960
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,943
With the vessel in the rectum,

961
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,428
we can use the catheter
to fill it with substitute urine.

962
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,831
The outlet.

963
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:12,383
It'll be in your sphincter.
So you have to... - ...clench.

964
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,071
Good, Loni. I like thoughtful people.

965
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,144
When I remove the catheter,

966
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,509
until you give the sample,
you mustn't relax.

967
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,344
Or it was all in vain.

968
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:27,386
Ingenious.
- But not my invention.

969
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:29,628
It's time.

970
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,546
Should I kneel?

971
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:37,268
Stand against the wall, bend over
and support yourself gently with your hands.

972
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,941
Did you just break up with him?

973
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,461
You're having a baby.

974
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,271
It's not his.

975
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,306
It's not?

976
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,389
He doesn't know, of course.

977
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:24,031
He wouldn't have proposed. And he couldn't
get me pregnant. What was I to do?

978
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:28,185
Wait for him to throw me out
after a younger woman shows up?

979
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:32,422
Or when he realizes
I'm not his class after all?

980
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:37,546
And now?

981
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:38,628
Don't know.

982
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,106
Well,

983
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,990
there's the father, too.

984
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,145
Whose is it?

985
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,270
Marc-Justin's.

986
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,630
My yoga teacher.

987
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:18,267
Yoga.
- Yes.

988
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,310
I took it up as preparation for tennis.

989
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,191
Tennis.
- Right.

990
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,784
Mental preparation.

991
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,104
For tennis.

992
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,145
With yoga.

993
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,988
And you really want to leave Michi?

994
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:46,662
And everything you've built up.

995
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,181
"Built up?" It's all gone.

996
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:08,102
"Hamburg. Hellweg Pharma's
insolvency application

997
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:12,629
will put an end
to the iconic German firm's 100-year history.

998
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:15,824
Insiders blame management's
speculative trading..."

999
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,471
Enough already!

1000
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:22,541
'While 1,000 workers demonstrated
outside the factory to preserve their jobs,

1001
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,347
union officials criticized
the Supervisory Board's decision

1002
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:29,908
to award managing director
Hans-Michael Nässer-Vonnwinkel

1003
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,102
a golden handshake

1004
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:35,025
of around 35 million Euros."

1005
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,906
Well,

1006
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:43,143
after everything Michi's done
for the company.

1007
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:47,148
"Last week, Nässer-Vonnwinkel
is also said to have sold shares

1008
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,826
worth 15 million Euros on the stock market."

1009
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,261
Strange. He never told me that.

1010
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,150
"Nässer-Vonnwinkel
dismissed all accusations as absurd.

1011
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,310
'Germany's envy culture disgusts me,'
he said.

1012
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,789
With his fiancé, he therefore plans
to relocate to Switzerland."

1013
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:06,710
To the Russians?

1014
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:12,311
It's been a long time
since you were last in Switzerland.

1015
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,906
Yes.

1016
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,424
Maybe you're right.

1017
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,508
Don't get me wrong, but...

1018
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,062
I think I was confused earlier.

1019
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:29,702
Sure.

1020
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,305
I understand.

1021
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,583
Hormones and everything.

1022
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:39,430
Michi's a great guy.

1023
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:42,149
You can say that again.

1024
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:51,551
There you are.

1025
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,141
Michi.

1026
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,745
My angel.

1027
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,149
Sorry I reacted like that.

1028
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,144
I was in shock.

1029
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,947
I didn't want you and our little darling

1030
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,984
to worry about these silly things.

1031
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,748
God only knows how much I love you.

1032
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,229
I love you too, my angel.

1033
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,781
Unbelievable.

1034
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:46,466
We have over 18,000 Euros in savings.

1035
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,584
I haven't offered you anything, Mr. Tapken.

1036
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,421
Thanks.

1037
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:03,786
Brandy.

1038
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:05,507
Well,

1039
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,507
I think you should sleep on it.

1040
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,789
Thanks, but I don't need to.

1041
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:15,543
My Willi always says: "if people give you
time to consider, they're being honest."

1042
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:20,069
He's nodded off. He often does these days.

1043
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:24,226
Then we shouldn't wake him up.
- Nonsense.

1044
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,502
Willi doesn't wake up so fast.

1045
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,262
I have a lot of appointments.

1046
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,703
Let's talk tomorrow?

1047
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,669
Fat chance, young man.

1048
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:37,669
Where do I sign?

1049
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:41,980
Of course.

1050
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:48,511
Up to you.

1051
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:03,022
That's the contract
for your pipe replacement and new shower,

1052
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:05,905
for 7,500 Euros.

1053
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:07,221
Here,

1054
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:08,751
please.

1055
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,260
And this...

1056
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:14,500
is the contract for the Washlet-G.

1057
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:17,146
The total is 18,175 Euros

1058
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,109
including delivery,

1059
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,149
installation, and sales tax.

1060
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:28,146
Here, to confirm
you've read our terms and conditions.

1061
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,102
And for the credit bureau.

1062
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,940
I'm so glad Willi can stay here now.

1063
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,189
Me too, Mrs. Schohusen.

1064
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,389
Ah, Mrs. Schohusen,

1065
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:49,906
in the "Seniors' Start-Up Pack,"
the Washlet-G...

1066
01:17:50,620 --> 01:17:53,988
comes with a toilet.
- So take this one with you.

1067
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:05,706
Would you be so kind, Mrs. Schohusen?

1068
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,541
Have a nice evening, Mrs. Schohusen.

1069
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,549
You too, Mr. Tapken.

1070
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,504
Thanks a million.

1071
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:25,379
So...

1072
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:26,427
So...

1073
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,344
Please relax.

1074
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,465
Loosen up.

1075
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,781
There...

1076
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:57,344
Nearly there.

1077
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,541
OK, when I say, "Now..."
- ...I clench.

1078
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:17,748
And...

1079
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:18,828
now.

1080
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:26,030
All the best.

1081
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,582
If there's anything else...

1082
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:34,747
Thanks, Doc.

1083
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,024
No problem. It's my job.

1084
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,348
Really very good filter coffee.

1085
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:48,660
I'll be going.
We can't risk me running into Kleinschmidt.

1086
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:50,582
Oh...

1087
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,830
For your steroid acne.

1088
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:55,268
Twice daily. For the award ceremony.

1089
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,147
You think of everything, Doctor.
- Thanks.

1090
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,427
Ladies.

1091
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,701
Goodbye, Doctor.
- See you, Doc.

1092
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:10,271
He's a great doctor.

1093
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:12,508
A real professional.

1094
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,219
SIX WEEKS LATER

1095
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:20,622
SIX WEEKS LATER

1096
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,545
Ladies and gentlemen,

1097
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,744
now to the women's
200-meter freestyle final.

1098
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,468
Representing Germany: Loni Nordahl.

1099
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:43,745
Our reporter, Frank Wenzel, is there.
Over to you, Frank.

1100
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:49,225
Welcome to this dream final with
the hotly-tipped favorite, Loni Nordahl.

1101
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:53,220
Nordahl is up against
Nebraska's world record-holder, Page Halmen.

1102
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:57,220
Will Loni get revenge
for her painful defeat in Oslo?

1103
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:01,391
It's Team Germany's last chance for a medal.

1104
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:05,141
In lane 6: Loni Nordahl,
carrying the whole nation's hopes.

1105
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,540
Two beers, please.

1106
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:09,311
Her goal: That coveted place

1107
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,106
on the podium. Loni wants gold.

1108
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:16,909
Trainer Ludmilla Svoboda says silver
would be a crushing disappointment.

1109
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,146
Real-life drama, ladies and gentlemen.

1110
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,823
It's rare for us to sit around
and have nothing we're more worried about.

1111
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:29,748
Cross your fingers that Loni
has a better start than last year in Oslo.

1112
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,267
We all know the start is her weakness.

1113
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:35,789
And certain things
recur to certain people...

1114
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,385
For you.

1115
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,548
A few seconds to go.

1116
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:43,790
Loni Nordahl in lane 6.
The 25-year-old from Brandenburg makes a..

1117
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,145
And they're off.

1118
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,546
Avery bad start.

1119
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,428
Page Halmen and Suntje van Geuns
set an unbelievable pace on the first lap.

1120
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,224
Loni's a fighter,

1121
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:02,106
but she's so far behind
that even for her, it's going to be...

1122
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:04,183
It's always the same.

1123
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:06,508
What a disappointment.

1124
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:08,941
The bubble will have to burst.

1125
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:14,471
Loni's doing everything to catch up,
but Page Halmen seems unbeatable today.

1126
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:18,301
Loni has thrown everything away.
How frustrating, ladies and...

1127
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,750
Oh, sweetie,

1128
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,311
it's wonderful here.

1129
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,951
Wild horses couldn't drag me back to Germany.

1130
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:28,991
Just a moment.

1131
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:30,381
Russian!

1132
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:34,627
Better?

1133
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:38,029
Oh, Michi really fusses over me.

1134
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,624
Russian again!

1135
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:44,346
The final lap.
Will Halmen or van Geuns get gold?

1136
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:49,501
Both going for a world record. Behind them,
Loni gains ground, trailing by a length.

1137
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:51,469
Loni's catching up!

1138
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:53,230
One centimeter at a time!

1139
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:55,104
Willi, it's the final.

1140
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,750
I'll turn it up.

1141
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,711
She overtakes the Dutchwoman!
- Right behind Page Halmen!

1142
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:02,944
Like a barracuda through the pool.
Aggressive...

1143
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:06,144
...elegant, quick as a shot!
- Page Halmen is losing steam.

1144
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,544
Loni, come on! - You can do it!
- 80 million people are cheering you on!

1145
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:13,790
She has the American in her sights.
Nearly there!

1146
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:15,670
Neck and neck!

1147
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:19,182
Unbelievable. Come on, Loni!
- Who's got the stronger attack?

1148
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,348
Pull, barracuda, pull!

1149
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:22,348
And...

1150
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,706
gold!

1151
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,301
World record!
- Gold for Germany!

1152
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,987
Loni Nordahl, the Brandenburg Barracuda,
wins gold for Germany.

1153
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,466
The Brandenburg Barracuda!

1154
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:35,710
Sport fans: Loni Nordahl has beaten
the world record by an incredible...

1155
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,591
And secures her gold medal.

1156
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:42,148
Incredible scenes are taking place
at the poolside.

1157
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,702
Trainer Ludmilla Svoboda
and team doctor Maxe Dietrich

1158
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,430
are embracing.

1159
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:49,941
This is their win, too.

1160
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:53,110
Only teamwork brings this kind of success.

1161
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:56,025
A true picture of happiness.

1162
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:19,225
What a sight, ladies and gentlemen.
She's smiling.

1163
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:24,028
She's glowing. Our Golden Loni.
What must she be thinking about?

1164
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:27,150
Her brutally tough preparations, perhaps?

1165
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:32,625
One thing's certain: Few athletes
deserve this triumph more than Loni Nordahl.

1166
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:36,987
I don't know about you,
but I've got goosebumps.

1167
01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:43,987
