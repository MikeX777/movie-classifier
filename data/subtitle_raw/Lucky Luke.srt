1
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,394
Thanks, Ma.

2
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,159
Who are they, Pa?

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,828
Get inside, John.

4
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,998
He's hurt. Let us in.

5
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,992
- I'll tendto him.
- I'll tell the sheriff.

6
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,038
The Cheaters' Gang is over with.
This time you lose.

7
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,840
- Cheaters never lose. Never!
- Get out.

8
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,355
Kill them!
It'll make for a nice memory!

9
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,712
- Get your Colt.
- Never! Don't do it!

10
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,357
Go, Molly!

11
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,989
You were lucky, John Luke.

12
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,198
You dodged the Cheaters' Gang.

13
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,753
And no one ever dodges a Cheater.

14
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,514
Believe me, you're...
very lucky, John Luke!

15
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,754
You beat death!

16
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,750
You're lucky! You're...

17
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,470
You're... Lucky Luke!

18
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,039
Got it already.

19
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,313
Got it already.

20
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,192
''American Hero''...

21
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,954
Got it already.

22
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,388
Lucky Luke!

23
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,312
Captain Mac Straggle, 20th Cavalry.

24
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,678
Colonel Mac Straggle has a message
from the President of the USA.

25
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,793
Thank the President
for checking in on me...

26
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,195
but I'm on vacation.

27
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,793
He says he's on vaca...

28
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,959
There's no vacation
for heroes of the West.

29
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,479
Kid, I know your father well.

30
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,676
He knows I stick to my guns.

31
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,234
He says I stick...

32
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,198
I'm going to tease pike
out of the Klondike.

33
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,194
Tell the President
I have an extra rod.

34
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,034
You can tell him yourself,
boy scout!

35
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,789
We lead in 2 states
and are neck and neck in the others.

36
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,473
I won't lose the election!

37
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,314
This transcontinental railroad
is the answer.

38
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,719
With the coasts linked,

39
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,555
America will exist.

40
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,678
Shortly, sir.
The New York-San Francisco line

41
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,672
will connect in Golden City
in 3 months.

42
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,349
That's too long.

43
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,832
We have to finish
before the elections next month.

44
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,554
The tracks will join...
in Daisy Town.

45
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,273
- Daisy Town?
-That's crazy!

46
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,790
-Too dangerous.
- We should burn it down!

47
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,274
Destroy Daisy Town!

48
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,079
Whoever harms my pretty Daisy
answers to me.

49
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,948
Don't get him wrong.

50
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,992
The Daisy Town
which Luke remembers

51
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,753
was heaven on Earth.

52
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,831
Mr. Maurice Austin Cooper,

53
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,229
Governor of Utah!

54
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,028
President...

55
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,190
gentlemen...

56
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
Pardon my being sentimental, but...

57
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,959
I'm recalling how

58
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,799
on July 2, 1831 ,

59
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,314
I came from Ireland

60
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,711
on the same boat as his father.

61
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,636
The Lukes tilled
the red soil of Daisy Town,

62
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,633
where our cattle grazed in peace.

63
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,353
But nowadays...

64
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,512
the area is infested

65
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,398
with desperados and Indians.

66
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,110
You know me, Winston.

67
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,829
If I were you...

68
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,633
But you're not. Not yet.

69
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,029
Let me finish this term

70
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,673
and maybe even another.

71
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,676
Here, Cooper.

72
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,712
In 3 weeks I'll drive in this spike
to inaugurate the last section.

73
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,509
- Mr. President, don't do it!
- It's insane.

74
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,797
I want Mr. Luke to establish order
in Daisy Town.

75
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,358
Do you accept this mission?

76
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,189
Yep.

77
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,799
How long will it take
to establish order?

78
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,237
48 hours.

79
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,429
Cigarette, anyone?

80
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,596
Still not smoking?

81
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,393
I have an Apatchi.

82
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,910
Still not smoking!

83
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,758
He quit!

84
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,874
Take care, Coop.

85
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,073
You're not obliged
to go back to Daisy Town.

86
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,114
That place is full of ghosts
for you.

87
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,393
I'll speak to the President.

88
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,399
I gave him my word.

89
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,550
Think it over.

90
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,593
I'm not made for thinking.

91
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,830
It's him, Miss! Lucky Luke!

92
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,519
That's enough kids.

93
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,193
Stay here. Be good.

94
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,276
Here!

95
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,754
I love you!

96
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,198
You're too lucky, Lucky Luke!

97
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,828
Way too lucky!

98
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,714
You're lucky, John Luke.

99
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,359
Very lucky!

100
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,991
You dodged the Cheaters'Gang.

101
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,950
You're lucky. You're...

102
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,029
Lucky Luke!

103
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,197
BIRTHPLACE OF LUCKY LUKE

104
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,876
Boots, size 54.

105
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,832
Andfor the horse?

106
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,630
Rain coming.

107
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,109
Up, you maggots!
And in single file!

108
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,120
You never get sick
of filling up jails?

109
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,035
Lucky Luke,
the man who never killed anyone.

110
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,398
You never got over
seeing your parents die.

111
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,670
That cod-face of yours
got a name?

112
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,150
Pat Poker.

113
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,753
Welcome to my town.

114
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,070
Missed.

115
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,711
Alas, you're unwelcome in mine.

116
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,548
How did you do
the 5-dollar bill trick?

117
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,031
Lousy.

118
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,554
Leave my office.

119
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,315
Daisy Town bodes ill for sheriffs.

120
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,871
The soil is red with their blood.

121
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,991
Before it gets red with yours,

122
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,232
bet on black
and get lost before nightfall.

123
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,636
Expect a gift from me tomorrow.

124
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,999
You alright with death?

125
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,193
Tomorrow I clean house.

126
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,751
John!

127
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,995
It's Flimsey.

128
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,356
Remember?

129
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,275
Down here, John.

130
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,549
In the barrel.

131
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,675
Flimsey?

132
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,913
Flimsey the bug!

133
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,269
What the heck?

134
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,194
We're glad to see you!

135
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,549
- Get out.
- You crazy?

136
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,919
Want them to kill me?

137
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,072
Tell everyone it's over now.

138
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,952
Time to come out of hiding.

139
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,350
Poker won't let his gang go to jail.

140
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,795
He hired a bad-ass bandit
to smoke you.

141
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,393
Who's the fat vat?

142
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,595
My wife.

143
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,558
No one's getting smoked, ma'am.
Pleasedto meet you.

144
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,917
Billy the Kid City! End of the line!
Time to die!

145
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,353
Billy the Kid's in town!

146
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,919
I'm worth 5000 dollars!

147
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,588
Good lolly, Mr. Billy!

148
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,316
Not Mister.

149
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,115
Just Billy.

150
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,557
Billy the Kid. Like you.

151
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,755
So long, Lilly.

152
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,277
Don't share with your brother!

153
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,755
Thanks for the ride!

154
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,992
Bam! Got the old hag!

155
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,593
Don't move, you hear?

156
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,955
You neither!

157
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,235
Don't move!

158
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,869
The boss is waiting.

159
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,758
Drop the gun, Q-Tip.

160
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,350
Start walking and keep them up.

161
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,955
So?

162
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,999
Got my money, wizard?

163
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,592
Andthe bird's unharmed.

164
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,716
So?

165
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,473
How much did your hen
drop from its ass?

166
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,512
- 15,000.
- Billy the Kid...

167
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,395
kill Lucky Luke for 15,000 dollars?

168
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,869
You're right.

169
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,110
10,000.

170
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,312
Lucky Luke sent me to reform school
when I was 7.

171
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,871
And I'd done nothing wrong.

172
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,913
I thought you'd killed your parents.

173
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,395
Exactly.

174
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,713
I'd done nothing wrong.

175
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,953
So I came to kill Lucky Luke
for personal reasons.

176
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,470
I'll pick up my money
once he's dead.

177
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,669
You offendatedme
by implying I could be bought.

178
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,876
And get me some cherry juice!

179
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,274
Next time, I want cherry juice!

180
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,597
He's coming! Barber Street!

181
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,950
Gentlemen?

182
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,996
I assume you know the way to jail.

183
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,036
Yep...

184
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,271
Sometimes life can get prickly.

185
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,675
Fourteen...

186
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,189
Pistol Pete.

187
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,395
Go on...

188
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,830
Fifteen...

189
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,519
RattlesnakeJoe.

190
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,511
So, Hank, what's up with you?

191
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,717
Goldie.

192
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,195
Digger's daughter?

193
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,549
Pregnant with our 6th.

194
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,352
You're not lonesome, cowboy.

195
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,750
Stop by sometime!

196
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,634
Next time, bud.

197
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,713
Won't be no next time.

198
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,795
I like you, Billy.
Don't make me hurt you.

199
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,589
Pretty lousy last words...
for a guy of your stature.

200
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,713
Out of luck.

201
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,588
Farewell, Lucky Luke.

202
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,069
This is my snack.

203
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,555
It's my snack! It doesn't count.

204
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,796
Farewell, Lucky Luke.

205
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,518
That's your water gun.

206
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,510
Nope.

207
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,596
Yeah.

208
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,029
I don't get it.

209
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,436
It worked in front of the mirror!

210
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,954
Poop! What's wrong?

211
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,476
Shut your traps, retards!

212
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,953
You're out of luck. So long.

213
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,235
He killed me!

214
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,435
I'm cold.

215
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,229
I'm hot.

216
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,310
Give me a snuggle...

217
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,232
I'm a monkey's uncle!

218
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,716
His bullets hit mine!

219
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,038
Banana-chocolate.

220
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,028
I wasn't hit.

221
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,835
I wasn't hit.

222
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,314
I'm not dead!

223
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,388
It hurts. It stings.

224
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,430
It stings a little.

225
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,193
You missedthe coach.

226
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,755
In the meantime,
I'll read you a story.

227
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,154
I don't want to go!

228
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,868
Tomorrow...

229
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,112
Luke will grow his blade of grass...
six feet under.

230
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,869
It's between us now.

231
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,355
Hey, guys!

232
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,954
Barrels in the buff!

233
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,593
This saloon is for denizens
of Daisy Town.

234
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,312
So pay for your last whiskies.

235
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,998
Hear that, friends?
Time to pack up and leave.

236
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,315
No! Stay put, you idiots!

237
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,796
Bet on 1 7, Lucky Luke.

238
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,589
16 sheriffs await you
at the cemetery.

239
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,989
Chips down.

240
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,874
No more bets.

241
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,794
Seventeen.

242
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,196
Black, odd and pray to God.

243
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,477
He rode off into the smoldering sky

244
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,150
He went off and let our kisses die

245
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,119
He left me
with just two eyes to cry

246
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,954
My lonesome cowboy...

247
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,999
shot my heart

248
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,389
like a bullet from his peacemaker

249
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,350
Thanks, Sam.

250
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,830
Rode in on his horse,
used all his force

251
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,194
Took me for a ride

252
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,639
Took his Belle with pride

253
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,960
My lonesome cowboy shot my heart

254
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,397
like a bullet from his peacemaker

255
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,556
I await my lover, await my hero

256
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,396
so that he and I
can start again from zero

257
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,315
Abullet for Belle

258
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,117
or ring your death knell

259
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,471
Abullet for Belle

260
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,474
or Belle will blast a bullet

261
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,438
into your heart

262
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,791
No, Pat!

263
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,198
Losing hand, Poker.

264
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,755
That hurts.

265
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,797
It's too late to fight.

266
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,513
Like my watch?

267
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,991
Lucky Luke.

268
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,877
The man who never killed anyone.

269
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,112
Killing has its good sides.

270
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,076
There's before the kill, and after.

271
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,638
It's in your head, your skin,
your bones.

272
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,034
It leaves traces.

273
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,399
And memories.

274
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,998
What will you do now?

275
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,269
Shoot the chandelier
to knock me out?

276
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,279
Poor little hero...
who never killed anyone.

277
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,109
Outside!

278
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,995
Get lost!

279
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,794
He's dead.

280
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,677
LUKE KILLS

281
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,754
I'll never kill anyone.

282
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,074
Never!

283
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,437
You never got over
seeing your parents killed.

284
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,399
You're not obliged
to go back to Daisy Town.

285
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,879
He's dead!

286
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,839
Killing has its good sides.
Alright with death?

287
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,195
Don't do it!

288
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,350
Outside!

289
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,270
Cowboy! Aren't you overdoing it?

290
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,080
Use your head.
No trains come by here.

291
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,995
Come on, kid. Let's go home.

292
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,793
Was that you who...?

293
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,477
Go on.

294
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,192
Do it again.

295
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,351
Are you done yet?

296
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,349
You talk!

297
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,677
You talk! Damn, he talks!

298
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,714
Okay, I got it.
I can talk. No news to me.

299
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,838
Now climb on me
and let's get going. Okay?

300
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,559
My name is John Luke.

301
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,268
I'm pacing around
and my horse can talk.

302
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,917
You done? Start smoking again!

303
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,235
I'm losing it.

304
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,468
Don't sit back down!

305
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,749
We have work, Lulu!

306
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,395
Have you forgotten?

307
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,950
The train, the President,
the mission, Daisy Town...

308
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,668
Your horse and only friend,
JollyJumper.

309
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,592
That true, unsung hero...
hidden under your butt.

310
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,513
- Have you forgotten or...
- Will you shut up?

311
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,433
What's ''shut up'' in Horse?

312
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,633
In Horse?
In Horse it goes like this...

313
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,878
We don't say it often
because it's a bit long.

314
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,952
Why didn't you talk to me before?

315
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,589
You never laid on the tracks before.

316
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,079
You know, Jolly...

317
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,517
- You're my only friend.
- True.

318
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,310
I'd have been nothing without you.

319
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,788
True too.

320
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,675
Yeah...

321
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,436
You got that right.

322
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,998
Eleanor... Eleanor's in love!

323
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,913
Too cute, Johnny-Johnny.

324
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,754
I don't love you, Eleanor.
I love no one!

325
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,151
He's hurt. Let us in.

326
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,276
I'll tend to him.

327
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,590
- I'll tell the sheriff.
- Don't do that.

328
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,752
The Cheaters Gang is over with.
This time you lose.

329
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,638
Cheaters never lose.

330
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,871
Kill him.
Make for a nice memory.

331
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,396
- Get your Colt.
- Never! Don't do it!

332
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,951
I swear, Coop.
I always thought I was doing good.

333
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,237
In fact I was seeking revenge.

334
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,318
You were seeking justice.

335
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,394
The West wouldn't be the West
without you.

336
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,514
You're Lucky Luke...

337
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,634
Astar in our flag.

338
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,439
I killed a man.

339
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,950
You rid the West of a scoundrel.

340
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,998
And life goes on.

341
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,479
As Governor,
I shouldtell you to continue.

342
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,798
But if I weren't afraid
of betrayingAmerica,

343
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,637
I'd tell you this death
is the chance of your life.

344
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,636
Anew life,
without guns, without violence.

345
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,197
In any case, a train
will soon run coast to coast.

346
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,713
Cities will take over
the great outdoors.

347
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,431
It's the end of our world, John.

348
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,151
All these farmers, these families...

349
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,913
They count on me.

350
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,076
- Who'll defend them?
-They'll find someone else.

351
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,470
Trust me. Change your life
before it's too late.

352
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,953
I'm here for you.

353
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,517
You realize what you're doing?

354
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,193
No, cowboy, not your Colt!

355
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,991
You realize what you're doing?

356
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,510
Do you realize?
You can't hang it up for good!

357
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,796
Cowboy... You're Lucky Luke!

358
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,429
KILLED BY LUCKY LUKE

359
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,191
I foundthat in the dust.

360
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,039
That's why I'm here, Sam.

361
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,548
For Daisy and her kids.

362
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,599
You have 280 years to go.

363
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,470
Geezer! Give us two cherry juices.

364
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,237
Your jail is full of drafts.

365
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,154
And soon your body will be,
Lucky Luke.

366
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,677
Have a lolly. I'll be a minute.

367
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,788
Thanks, Lucky.

368
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,949
You're the best triggers
in the county.

369
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,113
This town needs a sheriff.

370
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,910
Doesn't anyone want a clean slate?

371
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,479
To stop being a loner?

372
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,593
Being on the run?

373
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,958
To be respected and loved?

374
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,270
I don't know... to start a family.

375
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,952
Haven't we all dreamt of it?

376
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,754
Where's your Colt?

377
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,109
He has no gun!

378
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,510
Kill him!

379
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,155
You sent me to jail!

380
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,513
- Our fate is for us to decide.
- My fate wasn't 15 years in jail.

381
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,108
Kill him nice and slow!

382
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,478
Go on, you retards!

383
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,748
This will keep your mouth shut!

384
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,029
Nineteen...

385
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,076
Twenty.

386
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,629
Thanks, gentlemen.

387
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,390
I'm Billy the Kid!

388
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,149
And I'll ridthe West of Lucky Luke!

389
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,796
Out of my way, bowling ball!

390
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,395
Beautiful.

391
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,833
If any of you hyenas touches him,
you won't see the sun set.

392
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,471
Calamity!

393
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,316
Jane...

394
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,792
Hats off for a lady!
Lily-livered, snot-nosed lowlifes!

395
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,030
1 against 100.

396
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,229
You think you really got a chance,

397
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,994
Calamity Jane?

398
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,715
Two...

399
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,433
against 100.

400
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,030
Jesse James...

401
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,351
''To be great...

402
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,831
''is not to stir...

403
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,159
''without great...

404
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,113
''argument!''

405
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,469
Hamlet.

406
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,871
Act IV, scene 4.

407
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,393
Is what I hear true?

408
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,916
You hung up your Colt, Luke?

409
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,754
Jesse...

410
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,393
''The evil...

411
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,631
''men do...

412
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,837
''lives after them!

413
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,599
''The good, O the good...

414
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,435
''is oft interred...

415
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,597
''with their bones.''

416
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,399
Julius Caesar.

417
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,712
Act III, scene 3.

418
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,072
Luke is a legend.

419
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,276
He deserves to die in a duel.

420
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,676
And I won't let anyone

421
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,316
kill him, besides me.

422
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,312
I don't like your reason.

423
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,318
But my choices are limited.

424
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,835
You're deputy sheriff, JesseJames.

425
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,551
Where are you taking my Lucky?

426
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,351
And why a duel? Let's kill him now!

427
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,997
What matters is not
the blood spilled, but the ink.

428
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,359
In 100 years,
kids will read in history books

429
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,279
thatJesseJames,
the greatest outlaw ever,

430
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,794
killed Luke in a duel.

431
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,474
That's how it is.

432
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,518
Load of crap,
your greatest outlaw routine.

433
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,231
I'm the greatest outlaw ever!

434
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,597
I should kill Lucky Luke!
And I will kill Lucky Luke!

435
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,909
Give me that!

436
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,239
And in 100 years,

437
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,635
kids will read

438
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,309
that the Kid
was the greatest outlaw ever!

439
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,994
Billy the Kid,
the greatest outlaw ever,

440
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,395
killed Lucky Luke.

441
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,119
And Jesse James!

442
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,388
Catchy, isn't it?

443
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,029
Find another one.

444
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,470
I need your carriage, Doc.
Move.

445
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,796
I'll watch him.
Watch over the town.

446
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,430
You have 48 hours
to walk tall in your boots, Luke.

447
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,795
Become a legend again.

448
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,595
From hitherto forward, I'm sheriff.
Everyone in the saloon!

449
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,356
Hot cocoa for everyone.

450
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,552
And if you don't drink it,

451
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,109
straight to jail. That clear?

452
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,994
There's one left.

453
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,879
Is someone not thirsty?

454
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,790
That's better.

455
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,310
- What do we do?
- Put bad guys in jail.

456
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,149
Why?

457
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,356
To protect Lucky Luke. Get it?

458
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,995
Because he has no gun?

459
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,475
- Because I'm killing him.
- No, I am!

460
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,358
Where can we get badges?

461
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,955
- In the sheriff's office.
- So let's go there.

462
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,554
I'm a poor lonesome cowboy,

463
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,950
and a long, long way from home...

464
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,671
Let's get you comfortable.

465
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,913
Take off these pants.

466
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,558
I'll take care of that.

467
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,670
He needs the help of a real woman.

468
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,751
Let's see if I'm real or not.

469
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,835
Sweetie-pie!

470
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,273
I'll keep guard.

471
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,194
I'm dead.

472
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,638
You're the angel
of lonesome cowboys.

473
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,433
Good night, Jolly.

474
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,355
What the hell?

475
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,279
I'm sorry.
I thought you were my horse.

476
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,070
- Force of habit.
- Sorry.

477
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,759
It's called water, cowboy.

478
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,834
Feel any better?

479
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,235
Nothing to see here.

480
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,310
What are you doing?

481
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,829
Removing your boots.

482
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:58,957
What for?

483
00:48:59,400 --> 00:48:59,991
It's better.

484
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,954
Boots never come off!

485
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,553
Relax, tenderfoot.

486
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,634
Nails like that
keep you on your toes.

487
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,873
They'll skin your hide.

488
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,078
At least it'll be clean.

489
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,673
Got any dreams?

490
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,833
To walk on the moon.

491
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,719
Walk on the moon?

492
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,669
Why not?

493
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,113
Some man will do it
before I even see Paris.

494
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,838
Traveling is my dream.

495
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,314
For it to come true.
An old family custom.

496
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,551
Thanks.

497
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,470
Never say thanks.

498
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,875
Never!

499
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,634
Had any adventures?

500
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,989
Yeah, lots.

501
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,469
I'm Lucky Luke.

502
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,676
''Lucky Luke vs. the Daltons''...

503
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,194
I meant...

504
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,069
adventures...

505
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,228
in love.

506
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,676
Hold on.

507
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,276
What?

508
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,553
We squashed a snail.

509
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,915
Like my dad's hand.

510
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,713
The hand of a farmer.

511
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,674
Damn!

512
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,234
Farming is a pain.

513
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,158
This is no life for you.

514
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,469
Look at yourself.

515
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,798
You've even lost your luck.

516
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,998
You've become unlucky, Luke.

517
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,670
You're right.

518
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,197
You hit the nail on the head.

519
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,916
You okay, man?

520
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,468
Want some more?

521
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,395
Dumb ass!

522
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,828
Night, man.

523
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,509
Thanks.

524
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,158
Don't even try to change.

525
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,313
Some hero!

526
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:51,992
Goodnight!

527
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,588
I love you Belle. You're so soft.

528
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,389
So pretty.

529
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,313
But so damn hairy!

530
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,470
I love you Belle. You're so pretty.

531
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,632
Chill out, Lulu! Cowboy, wake up!

532
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,031
- Come closer.
- He's petting me!

533
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,316
- What is this?
- No touching!

534
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,232
Are you out of your mind?

535
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,670
Sorry, man! Come back!

536
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,189
Come back, Jolly!

537
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,278
BARE HAND LUKE

538
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,478
Bad guys: 84
Good guys: 41

539
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,917
Billy, we said no killing.

540
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,355
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him!

541
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,875
It wasn't me!

542
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,553
He's telling the truth.

543
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,792
McGriddle died of fright
just before the gunfight.

544
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,229
You see?

545
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,793
Okay... Jail.

546
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,515
- Jail!
- I just told them.

547
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,950
Oh yeah.

548
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,993
Sorry, Phil Defer.

549
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,192
Where is Luke?

550
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,439
You'll have to kill
Billy and Jesse first.

551
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,309
67 customers,
that makes 8200 dollars.

552
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,118
So long, sheriffs.

553
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,553
Honest money...

554
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,837
If the Daltons ever found out,

555
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,400
we'd be like a joke
on a lollypop stick.

556
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,399
Us! The baddest bandits in the West!

557
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,352
His blade of grass is stronger
than a cigarette!

558
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,354
What if the cowboy
is taking us for a ride?

559
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,397
What if he's tryingto escape?

560
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,833
No one can escape his fate, Billy.

561
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,109
Luke will take up arms again.

562
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,634
Fate tells me he'll take up arms...

563
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,233
starting right now!

564
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,438
''How poor they are,

565
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,830
those bereft of patience.''

566
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,948
Hamlet...

567
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,030
Act...

568
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,312
I'm sick of your ham!
I've eaten it for 3 days!

569
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,550
I already shot a teacher
because I hated her rhymes!

570
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,553
Yeah, keep on laughing!

571
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,553
It's the redhead
they'll read about instead.

572
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,189
I'll make history
and I'm starting now!

573
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,598
Damned right, flea-bite!

574
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,752
Jesse James.
Act I, scene 1 .

575
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,994
You okay, Jesse?

576
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,475
Night falls fast on El Paso...

577
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,755
This grass ain't made for smoking.

578
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,155
Sure ain't.

579
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,393
- Don't be stupid, Defer.
- You owe me for 5 years in prison!

580
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,028
You stand no prayer

581
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,676
with Phil Defer!

582
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,109
Don't move!

583
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,993
I'll be fine...

584
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,079
Sure, you will be.
It's a shoulder wound.

585
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,150
I'll have your lambkins
up and walking.

586
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,988
I'm sorry.

587
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,519
Never say sorry.

588
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:33,869
Cowboy!

589
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,069
Lucky Luke!

590
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,039
Where are you off to?

591
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,599
Saying bye to a pal.

592
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,153
- You want to leave?
- Yes. The two of us.

593
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,349
I won't follow you to kingdom come!

594
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,999
It's not that far.

595
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,549
I know a lake, with a log cabin.

596
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,472
Fish and clovers...

597
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,951
Jolly loves clovers.
Agood place to raise horses.

598
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,949
And kids.

599
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,235
Kids?

600
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,036
I meant to tell you some day...

601
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,879
I think it's about time...
to get married.

602
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,029
And have kids.

603
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,429
Thanks, I...

604
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,115
It may not mean much to you, man...

605
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,112
But Belle's the girl for me.

606
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,191
And don't feel
you have to come along.

607
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,797
First of all: I'm not a man.

608
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,396
Second: your saloon dancer
isn't worth a coyote fart!

609
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,352
Don't tell me you thought...

610
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,511
What?

611
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,228
Sorry, man... Calamity.
I apologize.

612
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,996
I'm not saying
you can't settle down.

613
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,832
It's that... You understand!

614
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,836
You need a girl who's a legend too.

615
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,229
Agirl...

616
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,390
like you!

617
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,314
Exactly.
I wasn't meant to be a legend.

618
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,675
Me neither.

619
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,310
I usedto want to run
a Ladies Saloon.

620
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,879
Drink tea.

621
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,030
Bake cakes...

622
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,633
It's my right!

623
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,635
You barely know her!
How do you know she loves you?

624
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:02,792
How do I know?
She risked her life for me!

625
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,279
Risked her life?

626
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,508
What do you think I do?
Sit around plucking my raccoon?

627
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,917
I'll tear every bone
from his stinking carcass,

628
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,072
use his ribs for a ladder
and piss on his face!

629
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,156
Son of a hyena!

630
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,038
Strange guy, that gal.

631
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,190
Mr. Cooper
is waiting in the sun room.

632
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,032
Thanks. Can you feedJolly?

633
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,918
It's taken care of, Mr. Luke.

634
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,277
Very nice. Fit for a horse!

635
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,236
Come in, John.

636
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,669
Coop...

637
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,918
How is she doing?

638
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,595
You know already?

639
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,150
In the West
news travels fast as a bullet.

640
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,069
I can't surprise you.

641
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,710
Have you forgotten
I think faster than my shadow?

642
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,833
Goose deuce,
codfish flush, ace-in-the-sole.

643
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,070
That.

644
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,389
Very well, sir.

645
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,391
Open it.

646
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,828
You set sail from Baltimore
in a week.

647
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,717
First stop, Dublin.

648
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,477
You can meet your cousins.

649
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,595
I didn't intend to go so far.

650
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,435
Without your gun,
how will you protect your wife?

651
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,549
You've sent half the country
to jail.

652
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,592
You'll never be safe here.

653
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,989
If I were you, I'd move to France.

654
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,794
Or Belgium.

655
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,439
You could do a show.

656
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,956
Or sell your sketches,
if you still can draw.

657
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,313
Take the tickets.

658
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,440
You can't live in the West
without a gun.

659
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,999
If he'd understoodthis,

660
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,396
your father
would have done the same.

661
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,595
I owe you one.

662
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,633
Be happy with your wife.
Have lots of kids.

663
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,269
That's enough for me.

664
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,992
I'll miss you, John.

665
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,069
''He that ceases to be a friend
never was one.''

666
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:32,276
Act III, scene 4. Othello.

667
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,749
Shakespeare.

668
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,353
You left this
on your parents' gravestone.

669
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,999
I want what I'm owed.

670
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,199
Aduel, to fuel the history books.

671
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,953
Forget it, Jesse.

672
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,793
You know it's over.

673
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,158
Get your gun
or I'll widen her a-hole.

674
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:02,035
I mean the hole in her arm.

675
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,197
''A'' as in arm. You understood.

676
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,355
The hole in her arm. Her arm-hole.

677
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,033
I'll make it bigger.

678
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,836
I'll give her another a-hole.
Asecond one. Bigger.

679
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,632
I see why you need Shakespeare.

680
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,588
Get your Colt.

681
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,393
You know that I won't.

682
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,590
You have no reason to shoot Belle.

683
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,555
It's raining.

684
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,036
Yep.

685
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,359
You're still in the West.

686
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:42,757
To lay down the law,
you have to carry a gun.

687
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:44,749
Pick up your Colt.

688
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,115
Or die.

689
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,832
If I end up with lead in me,

690
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,558
at least it'll be from you.

691
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,315
No, John!

692
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,790
Say farewell to your cowboy, lady.

693
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,634
No way, José!

694
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,672
You sure shut up the poet!

695
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,753
Finally a fair duel!

696
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:39,711
Give him a gun!

697
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,358
''Give him a gun!''

698
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,954
Want a gun?

699
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,635
- Don't get wet.
- No more games, Billy.

700
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,397
You stole my childhood, Luke.

701
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,035
I'll steal your old age.

702
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,034
With your Colt.

703
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,954
Blanks...

704
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,037
Wait!

705
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,118
You said
you'd never shoot your gun again!

706
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,919
It's not mine.

707
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,559
Hold on, Lulu!

708
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,553
It was just a joke!

709
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,676
To impair you.
No, to scare you!

710
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,633
- Who put in blanks?
- No one.

711
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,518
- Who?
- No one!

712
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:40,112
I've had my eyes on your gun
since Jesse took it from the grave!

713
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,232
I had no choice.
It was that or be killed.

714
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:45,558
Poker promised me
I could leave with you.

715
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,918
John, please forgive me!

716
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,748
We'll have a family... kids...

717
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,997
The boat's waitingfor us!

718
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,072
John, don't go, please!

719
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,113
Stop calling me John.
I'm Lucky Luke!

720
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,275
Holy guacamole!
What's going on?

721
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,149
- Sorry, Sam.
- Lucky Luke!

722
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,555
Your gun!

723
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,556
You alone?

724
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,509
The bandits left at dawn.

725
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,672
The others are at the station,
waiting for the President.

726
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,355
The train...

727
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,439
It's over 4 hours late now.

728
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,275
The President...

729
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,230
Right. The tracks were wiped clean.

730
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,313
The arrows smell of sequoia sap
and whiskey.

731
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,276
They want to frame the Indians.

732
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,639
Poker to a tee!

733
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,550
You were right.

734
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,669
Saloon dancers
aren't worth a coyote fart!

735
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,279
You're a real pal.

736
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,833
The President pardoned me once.

737
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,879
I owe him one.

738
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,914
Wait for me!

739
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,039
I want to come too!

740
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,392
History is me!

741
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,388
- What's that horse?
- It's a rental.

742
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,432
I promisedto return it
to its owner

743
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,593
before I shot him!

744
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,908
Where are we going?

745
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,557
There's nothing this way.

746
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,076
Except sure-fire death.

747
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,111
Yep.

748
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,353
''He who dies this year
is all square

749
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,709
with next year!''

750
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,515
Hot diggity dead dog!

751
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,951
I'll be a monkey's uncle!

752
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,514
It's a mirage.

753
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,516
It was hidden behind a mirage.

754
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,512
Aone-armed bandit!

755
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,559
Looks more like a gigantic
slot machine...

756
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,992
Aone-armed bandit, that is.

757
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,075
How do we get in?

758
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,072
Looks like your luck's back.

759
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,792
Billy, Jesse, try the back.
I'll try the front.

760
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,838
Exactly what I had planned.

761
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,954
But I don't like
getting orders from you.

762
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:41,876
Want a boost?

763
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,829
Thanks, man.

764
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,349
''To be...

765
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,478
''or not to be.

766
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,552
''That is the question.''

767
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,311
I was good, huh? I acted well!

768
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,074
You're an outlaw, not an actor.
Let's go.

769
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,353
I'm not an actor?

770
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,828
Say that again.

771
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,992
You're an actor.
An amazing actor, Jesse.

772
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,192
Best actor in the West.

773
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,628
You're Sarah Bernhardt,
only hairier.

774
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,272
You're a shitty actor!

775
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,708
What do I do? Watch the ponies?

776
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,799
I'll play solitaire.

777
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,514
Two cards.

778
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,273
Lucky Luke vs. Pat Poker.

779
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,831
Doesn't it feel like déjà vu
from another life?

780
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,434
I'm all in.

781
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,113
Careful, President.

782
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,275
Your life's at stake.

783
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,709
Set him free or...

784
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,829
Or what?

785
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,629
You'll kill me?

786
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,915
You've forgotten.

787
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,799
I'm already dead.

788
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,839
That's magic!

789
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,830
Poker... I think I've won.

790
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,389
I call you.

791
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,032
Straight flush, hearts.

792
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:00,675
Good going!

793
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,073
Full house.

794
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,272
Aces high.

795
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,117
Pathetic.

796
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,076
Kill them!

797
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,593
I'm counting on Luke
and his lucky star.

798
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,952
It better be a shooting star.

799
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,069
Hey, girls!

800
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,518
Billy, trying to look taller?

801
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,677
At least I don't walk on my coat!

802
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,150
- Done reloading?
- Relax. I have 2 guns.

803
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,795
Those morons
won't even see us come in.

804
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,916
One, two...

805
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:52,871
Five!

806
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,794
You're right, Billy.
They all fell for it.

807
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,989
The stage door's always in the back.

808
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,116
You ugly mugs...

809
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,833
no more slugs?

810
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,150
Quad aces, Poker.

811
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,756
In a dead end,
nothing like a friend.

812
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,836
That's us!

813
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,196
Kill the President!

814
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,188
Jesse, the President!

815
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,391
You okay?

816
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,676
''My will is my body's gardener.''

817
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,079
Othello. Act I, scene 3.

818
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,998
Kill the President!

819
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,759
Behind you, Caca!

820
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,832
Stop calling me Caca!

821
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,148
Thanks, Kyky!

822
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:24,310
Kill the President!

823
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,476
It's not my fault!

824
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,518
I swear on the life of...

825
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,869
On whose life?

826
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,995
On Belle's life, how's that?
Honestly, it should do.

827
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:42,629
On Belle's life...

828
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,434
You wait here.

829
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,795
Watch out, John!

830
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,229
Why didn't you take that boat, John?

831
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,075
Coop?

832
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,078
You can't be behindthis!

833
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,599
You should have left!

834
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,670
How could you? This is crazy!

835
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,269
I'll be President!

836
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,028
Agreat President!

837
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,916
I knew no bullet could kill you!

838
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,109
I had to destroy you from within!

839
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,310
From within!

840
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,669
I knew it! I knew it!

841
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,589
I knew killing a man would kill you!

842
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:43,836
I knew it!

843
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:57,550
Give up, Cooper.

844
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,316
- You've lost.
- Remember, John.

845
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,998
Cheaters never lose... Never!

846
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,158
The Cheaters' Gang.

847
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,238
You were one of them.

848
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,709
It's you.

849
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,713
You killed my parents.

850
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:16,829
It's you.

851
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,354
Your father...

852
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,472
was a brother to me.

853
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:39,438
Until he met that...

854
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,438
that filthy Indian squaw!

855
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,671
Who became your mother.

856
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,837
He wanted to turn us in.

857
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,718
He left me no choice.

858
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,313
Like you, today.

859
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,198
Don't deceive yourself.

860
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:01,149
I won't think twice.

861
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,032
I didn't hesitate either...

862
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,356
To kill your mother...
to kill your father.

863
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,795
So do it, John.

864
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,149
Kill me!

865
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,918
Kill me if you're a man.

866
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,273
I can draw,

867
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,069
sing... collect medals...

868
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,110
I can even speak a little Horse.

869
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,148
But I can't kill.

870
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,479
Farewell then!

871
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,432
You had it all built backwards.

872
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,156
Everything but the ''C''
on your hat.

873
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,388
The hat...

874
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,670
500 feet, John.

875
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,154
Fantastic!

876
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,348
Here, John.

877
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,439
Try this now.

878
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:58,674
With this...

879
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,792
you'll be a man.

880
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,036
Squeeze... tight!

881
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,953
The badge looked good on you.

882
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,555
But it made holes in my outfit, sir.

883
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,153
The cripple meant me!

884
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,436
The United States
needs men like you,

885
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,113
courageous and honest.

886
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:43,869
I don't like this.
What flavor is it?

887
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,873
The flavor
of a change of profession.

888
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,351
Gentlemen, I can offer you
150 dollars pay

889
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,673
and no job security,
but the prestige of the badge.

890
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:58,276
Like you, my face belongs on posters,
my name in books.

891
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,751
Me too.
But my name in bigger letters.

892
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,952
In that case, gentlemen...

893
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,150
I suggest you be
as far away as possible

894
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,118
when these cigars go out.

895
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,670
''Mercy is not strained.
It drops from heaven

896
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:15,798
''as a gentle rain.
It blesses him that gives

897
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,519
''and him that takes.''

898
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,558
The Merchant of Venice. Act IV.

899
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,835
Scene 1 .

900
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,234
Beginner's luck.

901
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:25,636
Lolly, Pops?

902
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,155
There they are! Goddamn scumbags!

903
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,030
- Game of poker?
- Get in!

904
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,790
10 blind, andflush beats straight!

905
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,029
Shut up!

906
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,759
Shut up, you oldfart!

907
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,070
Shut up, you very oldfart!

908
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,435
I knew it!

909
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,117
Go to hell! Filthy lout!

910
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,033
I swear I didn't know.

911
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,795
Poker said you'd change.
I wantedto give you a family.

912
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,038
-To give us a chance.
- Achance for what?

913
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,592
When you put in the blanks,
we hadn't even met.

914
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,356
I always loved you, Johnny Johnny.

915
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,196
Eleanor! Eleanor's in love!

916
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:39,075
Someday I'll marry you,
Johnny Johnny.

917
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,273
I don't love you, Eleanor!
I love no one!

918
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,954
Eleanor?

919
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,279
But you were so...

920
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,468
I was awful with you. I'm sorry.

921
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:58,833
I'm leaving, John.

922
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,358
Paris, London, Rome...
My dream awaits me.

923
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,348
I wish you the best.

924
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,039
An old family custom.

925
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,948
They're kissing!

926
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,633
I'll always love you.

927
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:33,439
Save your death for me, Luke Lucky.
Jesse James, end of Act I.

928
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,833
But it'll be me
who smokes your hide!

929
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:39,150
Lollypop?

930
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,275
Farewell, Lucky Luke.
Or rather...

931
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,239
See you around!

932
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:48,914
Real friends, huh?

933
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,830
We're all wild brats
of the Wild West.

934
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,435
Your steam horse
won't change a thing.

935
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,718
My dear friends,

936
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:10,999
dear friends of Daisy Town...

937
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,431
What have you done with my gifts?

938
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:17,275
On Judgment Day
one of us can hold his head high.

939
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,353
Thanks to him... your town is free!

940
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,195
The railroad
will span the United States.

941
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,034
And I'm alive to see it happen!

942
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,998
Thank you... Lucky.

943
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,070
Don't mention it.

944
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,275
So...

945
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,673
So I solemnly do bestow upon him

946
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,078
the Hero's Star.

947
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,439
The twenty-first of our great flag.

948
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,311
Where is he?

949
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,552
He has that medal already.
I'll hang it over my bar.

950
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,119
It's tea time!

951
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,828
Drinks for everyone!

952
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,753
Earl Grey, Indian Breakfast,
Ceylan and cookies!

953
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,559
There's whisky too.

954
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,475
Miss, do you need a pianist
in your tea room?

955
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:08,234
Maybe I do.
Can you make cookies?

956
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:09,913
I do wicked apple strudel.

957
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,720
Change your clothes
and call meJane.

958
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,915
Can't you finish the song someday?

959
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:34,831
Yep.

960
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:35,796
Go ahead!

961
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,038
Let's not start bickering now!

962
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,350
I don't know how the song ends.

963
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,431
I'll tell you how it goes.

964
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:45,399
I got a gorgeous, handsome horsey!

965
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,469
- Know that part?
- No, I don't.

966
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,869
Yes, you do.

967
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,157
Then I have
another possibility.

968
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,359
The real hero
is the mustang...

969
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,114
Whose hum-hum
goes bang-bang!

970
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,112
I have an idea.
Just shut up.

971
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,429
Excellent.

972
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,509
Like the man says:
me hero, you horse.

973
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,154
Enjoy the scenery.

974
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,239
Look at that sunset.

975
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,833
It's pretty pretty.

976
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,874
By golly, Jolly!

977
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,635
Jolly?

978
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,956
- Try to act jolly, Jolly.
- Okay.

979
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:51,914
Hey!

980
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,476
My name's Lucky Luke.
I quit smoking in 1983.

981
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,631
I'm much better now.
