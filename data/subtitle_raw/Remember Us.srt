1
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,360
Go on then, Miss Dudu,
have a nice working day.

2
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,600
Are you going to the coffee house again,
Nedret?

3
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,040
Where else!

4
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,319
Run, run!
Nobody has been there before you.

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
The owner of the coffee house
will put up your statue in the square.

6
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,040
With a chair stuck on your ass.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,280
Well, very good,
What else would I want?

8
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,440
Have a nice working day.

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
Thank you, brother.

10
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,320
Where is Huseyin?
Is it you who’s opening the shop again?

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,000
He'll come, he'll come.
He is a little sick today.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
As if he really is sick!

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Instead of telling me that
he'll wake up in the evening at best.

14
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,080
They drank last night again, right?

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,520
What can I do?
Shall I leave the shop closed?

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,600
What do you mean by
what can I do?

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,680
Is it me instead of you
who is going to do it!? You are a father.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,280
You are going to take him
before you and talk to him.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,360
You are going to pull on his ear.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,640
Isn't it a shame that you are getting up
every morning in this age!?

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,200
Don't open it one morning and
let the cuckold hit the panic button.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,800
-Right, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,800
If you give him cloth,
he'll ask for the lining.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,600
Look at this.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,440
It doesn't matter if there are
dustbins all around.

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,400
What one needs is good manners.

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,800
Don't put it down,
it'll lose its abundance.

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,560
God bless you, Mr. Esref.
You are a johnny-on-the-spot.

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,160
If the devil lost his hand in my bag,
he wouldn't be able to find it back.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,640
Good morning.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,280
-Were you coming to me?
-No.

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,920
I got a little bored.

33
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,280
I couldn't fall asleep, either.

34
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
Is it your head again?

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,560
Do you drink water?

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,320
-Of course, I do.
-Drink it abundantly.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,400
It is usually caused by thirst.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,160
-Come on, let me make us coffee.
-No, let me go to the seaside.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,680
You can go later on,
the sea will be there forever.

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
It's been standing there for ages.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,880
Let me make you a bitter coffee
so that you can open your eyes.

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,640
Maybe It'll stop your ache.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Well, I'm saying so but you
haven't seen a doctor yet, Mr. Esref.

44
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,880
Why would I?
I am just fine.

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,120
You are, you are but...
I don't know.

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,680
You have my deceased mother's
stubbornness.

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,320
Just like you...

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,320
...she would bury her head
like an ostrich...

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,840
...when we talked about
seeing a doctor.

50
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,120
Your mother was 100 years' old
when she died, though.

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,080
Fair enough.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,160
-May she rest in peace.
-May she rest in peace.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
See, she wanted grace.

54
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,680
Oh, great Mrs. Mukaddes.

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,960
My dear mother.

56
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,080
Are these new?

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,760
I bought them from Izmir.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,320
Its linen is nice.

59
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
Put sugar in it if you can, please

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,160
New tricks to old dogs.

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,640
It is so this morning.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
A sweet morning.

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,920
What a beautiful saying.

64
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Now, let me take a picture
of the two cups side by side.

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,680
Then, I will post it on my page.

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,400
And I'll write “A sweet morning” under it.

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,320
My customers love it.

68
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I have 3572 followers.

69
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
Wonderful.

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,840
If your son followed me, too...

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,720
...at least 1000 people would
come upon me.

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,120
He is busy.
He must not have seen it.

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm only joking.

74
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,160
Why would he deal with me?

75
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
He is a busy man.

76
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,880
My son...

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,080
Are you up?

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,600
Did you wake up?

79
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,959
Are you awake?

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,360
Sleep now,
Fatos will be here soon.

81
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,200
Well done, my son.

82
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,640
Right, I'm up.
Why did he cry?

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,600
-Hasn't Fatos arrived yet?
-No. Okay, I'm leaving now.

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,720
You are late, Fatos.

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,640
The metrobus hit the wirey things.
They made us wait a bit.

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,040
Quick, Uras has woken up.

87
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
I'll be there right now.

88
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,640
Thank you, God bless your hands.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,960
You're doing it again.

90
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,320
Your money is not valid here, Mr. Esref.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,920
How many times
do I have to tell you?

92
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
You bring good luck to me, anyway.

93
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,520
When you come,
this shop swarms with people.

94
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Come on, Leman,
what luck are you talking about?

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
I wish this good luck touched me too.

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,800
How can it touch you more?

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,720
Not only here, did you not sew the clothes
of the whole of Izmir?

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,560
Didn't the villager, the city-dwellers
run to you?

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,960
Was there anything better than your art?

100
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,800
Even now, all of those Haute Coutures
can't hold a candle to you.

101
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,440
Come on, Leman,
what remains of my art?

102
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
Don't talk like a mad person.

103
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,120
You are not saying that you are lazy
and that you loaf about.

104
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,560
Empty excuses.

105
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,880
Good morning, sister.

106
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,640
Good morning.

107
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,160
Where is my red dress?

108
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,680
You promised.

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,520
I was going to wear it
on Safiye's wedding.

110
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,240
The girl got married and
had her second baby.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,960
Anyway, dear.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,560
I'll wear it on her children's wedding.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,320
The red dress would really suit
me well when I am 80.

114
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,360
Sister Leman...

115
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,560
...my mother wants
50 buns with olives.

116
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,360
It is due for this afternoon.

117
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Has your mother opened
a public soup-kitchen?

118
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,440
What's 50?

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,120
Are you asking the British royal family
to join you for tea?

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,840
Look, tell that mother of yours...

121
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,760
...I heard she was saying she made
the buns to her guests.

122
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,720
That Perihan shouldn't make me
fly into a rage.

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,120
I'd let her lie out in the middle of
the downtown.

124
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
Dad...

125
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,440
...the harbour is this way.

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,200
You are right.

127
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,480
Okay, there is no problem.

128
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,560
They are the script crew, let them wait,
what's their job?

129
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>They’re going to get out of here and
rush an episode, following your directives.</i>

130
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,000
<i>They stopped the set.</i>

131
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,800
<i>They are afraid that we’re going
to go empty this week.</i>

132
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,760
What can I do, Ozge?

133
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,360
Shall I wear wings and fly?

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
The traffic is not moving at all.

135
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,520
Hang up! Don't make me break your
heart in the morning.

136
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,440
What's he waiting for?
Sound the horn for him!

137
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,400
Good morning, Mr. Kaan.

138
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,240
-Good morning Mr. Kaan.
-Good morning.

139
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,080
My notes are zipped on the desktop.

140
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,200
Examine it carefully and then,
send the e-mail.

141
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,840
Don't bring disgrace on me
like the last time, Ozge.

142
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,200
Ozge, I know this look very well.

143
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,720
It's a look that says,...

144
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,440
...“Do I really deserve this cruelty just
because I wrote “their” instead of “they are”?

145
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,920
Get angry, upset with me as much as
you like now...

146
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,559
...but one day,
you will thank me.

147
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,960
In that “they are”...

148
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,640
...lies a big career, a big life.

149
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
You will understand it, then.

150
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,039
Are you hungry?
Shall I order a toast?

151
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,240
There's no need.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,720
Right, good morning, friends,
from a horrible and...

153
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,280
...disgusting Istanbul morning.

154
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
-Good morning.
-Welcome.

155
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,560
Let me point out that it'll be
a bloody morning.

156
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,880
That's why we're going to
speak clearly and frankly.

157
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,000
You know that this is
for the sake of our job.

158
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Don't take this personally but...

159
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,360
...if we were to shoot
the last episode you wrote...

160
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
...we would be killing the series
which is...

161
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,600
...already on shaky ground.
Let me tell you that.

162
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,560
Good luck.

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,840
Thank you.

164
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,200
What did you do?
Have you caught anything?

165
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
Brother Cemal!

166
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,600
What happened to the man?

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
Mr. Esref!

168
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,160
Brother Esref!

169
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,840
Something happened to the man.

170
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,120
Mr. Esref!

171
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
Get closer, get really closer.

172
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,000
<i>The greatest problem in our series is
</i>the male character.

173
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,320
The boy has no dynamic, friends.

174
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,280
Especially that last episode.

175
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
What is that?

176
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,880
He's sending the girl flowers,
feeding the cats on the street.

177
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,320
What did you do?

178
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,040
There is no reason not to have the loser hold
hands with the kids in the park and sing.

179
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,920
Mr. Kaan, stray animals are receiving a
positive feedback from the viewers.

180
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,920
We used the flower because...

181
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,120
...he was a bit firm with the girl
in the previous episode.

182
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,120
Miss Rana, these are lukewarm events.

183
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,040
The viewers do not even care
about these.

184
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,720
The female viewers like things
like that now, Mr. Kaan.

185
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,480
For them, the classical male typing is--

186
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
Is that so?

187
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,680
Where is that female viewer
who likes characters like this?

188
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
I cannot see them myself.

189
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
We are number 6 in total,
the rating is 3.80...

190
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,520
...It says 10.30 share in this list.

191
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,920
Where is that female viewer?

192
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,720
I can't see her.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,320
I wonder where they have gone to!?

194
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,520
Mr. Kaan, when we look at
the viewers' survey...

195
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,680
...we see that women no longer accept men
with macho attitudes.

196
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,520
Miss Rana, they are 3-5 people.

197
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,760
Those women who live in your neighbourhood
and don't watch television.

198
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,520
We have nothing to do
with them anyway.

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
Look, you're playing
for the cinema viewers again.

200
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
I tell you all the time,
they are different.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,120
Miss Rana, are you kidding me?

202
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,080
Are you living in Norway or something?

203
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,680
Or perhaps you are watching BBC
every night.

204
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Have you ever wondered and looked
at the series that are above us?

205
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,680
There is a bloodbath there.

206
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,040
Okay, now I'm not saying
let's give a gun to our guy...

207
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,720
...and have him kill
whomever comes his way.

208
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,040
But you literally portrayed
a sexless character.

209
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
I'm sorry I'm going to speak clearly.

210
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,760
Let a few women shout that
they don't want to see a macho man...

211
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,520
...or shout about the women's rights or
the state of being an individual...

212
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,640
...the rest of the women,
when they go across television,...

213
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,440
...they want to see a man.

214
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,640
A man.

215
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,600
And for two hours, they forget about
their sluggish husbands...

216
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
...and kiss the man in the series
in their heads.

217
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,120
And that's our job.

218
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
To give them a soft porn material.

219
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,960
What happened?
Did you take offense by this sentence?

220
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm sorry but that's
the gist of the matter.

221
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
I wish it wasn't like this...

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,400
...I wish we didn't work
for such an audience.

223
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,960
But unfortunately, we do.

224
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,000
This is our sea, it's shallow.

225
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,360
Shallow.

226
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't expect anything deep, please.

227
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,520
<i>How is he?</i>

228
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,960
Good, good.
He's being given serum now.

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,280
He just collapsed suddenly as
he was shouting at me.

230
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
I didn't understand
what happened.

231
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
Thank you so much,
Captain Kemal.

232
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
I hope he gets well soon.

233
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm here, you can go on your way.

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
Call his son.

235
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,240
He really abandoned you.
Let him come and take a look.

236
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,800
He is stubborn, you know.

237
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,720
He said not to call him but you
call him secretly, anyway.

238
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,040
-I hope he gets well soon.
-Thank you.

239
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,200
What happened, Mr. Esref?

240
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
It's nothing, don't fuss.
I am good.

241
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,360
I blacked out and I fainted.

242
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,080
We can't have this bird here,
though, sister Leman.

243
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,200
Like she is going to break the cage
and eat us, God protect us!

244
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,360
The man wanted it.
She is his faithful friend.

245
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,440
What happened?
What did the doctor say?

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,240
Well, what should she say?
Clean air and plenty of food.

247
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,960
Don't do this, Esref.

248
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,680
Is that a serum?

249
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
What's happening?
What's his state?

250
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,040
I don't know.
You can ask the doctor.

251
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,600
We were just talking about you now.

252
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,080
How have you been, Mr. Esref?

253
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,680
Good, how have you been?

254
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm going to get up once this is over.

255
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,040
I'm taking up space here for nothing.

256
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,400
There are sick patients, doctor.

257
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,800
Doctor, let's go outside
to talk for a bit.

258
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,240
Of course.

259
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Tell me everything without keeping
anything from me.

260
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,160
Tell me so that I can watch my step
with this stubborn goat.

261
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,680
I guess it's not an ordinary faint.

262
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,720
He was having an epileptic seizure
when the captain found him.

263
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,360
What they told me is that his jaw was
locked and he was shivering.

264
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,960
As far as I know,
he's been having severe headaches...

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,920
...and he's been forgetting
stuff for a long time.

266
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,600
The same old same old.
We've gone back to the beginning again.

267
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,200
Are we not going to do something
we like in this country?

268
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,440
Never mind. We'll copy and paste
the series from last year.

269
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,360
Shake your head and
get your pay check.

270
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,440
Someone runs away with the girl and
the boy saves her in this episode.

271
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,640
Just write it away.

272
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,280
-Only for the sake of our job.
-For the sake of our job.

273
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
-May it be easy.
-Thank you.

274
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,320
I'm telling him right away.

275
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,640
What happened?

276
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,480
Mr. Ilker is expecting you
in his room.

277
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,400
Can you bring my phone?

278
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,920
Hello.

279
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,280
-Is Mr. Ilker available?
-Yes, of course, he's expecting you.

280
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,760
Why have you panicked so much, boy?

281
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Sit down, child, sit down.

282
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,520
If I hadn't seen the reports
that are before me, maybe.

283
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,200
But let our competitors panic, Kaan.

284
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
We thought you were abroad.

285
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,280
I was in a meeting.

286
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,720
You asked for me suddenly,
I'm unprepared, Mr. Ilker.

287
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,160
We're not eating men up here.

288
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Well, sometimes we do but...

289
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,920
...you are not one of them

290
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,160
You are the head of the
most successful unit in this channel.

291
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,760
Our dramas are doing really good.

292
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you.

293
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,560
-I want to jump right into the subject.
-Yes.

294
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,920
We have two subjects.

295
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,120
The first one...

296
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,680
...what do you say to being
the head of the team...

297
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,680
...that will go to Los Angeles Festival
next week?

298
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,880
I don't trust this sales unit much.

299
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,280
Because they are inexperienced.

300
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
I think you should talk to the customers
one on one...

301
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
...as you are selling our series.

302
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,520
I'm sure you'll come back having
sold all of them like a monster.

303
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,040
What do you say?

304
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,680
Great, I mean it would be great.

305
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,640
-I'm glad.
-Great.

306
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
The second one is that
this place...

307
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,960
...deserves a new chief editor.

308
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,960
I mean, Mr. Ersoy is a
bit old for this place now.

309
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
I want a young and
dynamic person like you...

310
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,160
...to create storms over the viewer.

311
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,400
What do you say?

312
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
I mean, oh, God.

313
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Of course, with pleasure.
Thank you.

314
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,800
Of course, these are staying
between us for now.

315
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,560
Of course.

316
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,960
I will tell this to Ersoy
in an appropriate way.

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,440
He is my old friend after all.

318
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,640
See? We are not asking the men
we'll eat to come up here.

319
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,200
What is it?
Are you upset about Ersoy?

320
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
He's a valuable person.

321
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
I learned a lot from him in the past.

322
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
5 years ago, I went through
the same scene with him in this room.

323
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,160
He felt nothing about his old boss.

324
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,520
You are a good boy, Kaan.

325
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,400
<i>I'd like to congratulate
</i>those who raised you.

326
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,840
<i>But don't forget...</i>

327
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,200
<i>...the place for sentimentality
in this profession...</i>

328
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,120
<i>...is only in those series you make.</i>

329
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,840
Don't you ever, ever project these
onto your real life.

330
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Because your burden doubles
from this day on.

331
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,360
You are going to work really hard.

332
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,880
Anyway...

333
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,800
...one day we'll talk about all these
over dinner.

334
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,560
About that sentimental matter too.

335
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,920
Don't let the people downstairs
be without you until that day.

336
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,480
Make them work really hard.

337
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,680
Don't worry.

338
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,000
Okay, then.

339
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,920
-Let's hope for the best.
-Thank you.

340
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,319
Hello, Kaan.

341
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,119
I am Leman.

342
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,359
I know, sister Leman.

343
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,079
What happened?
Is it my father?

344
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,960
Don't you bustle now.

345
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,960
Listen to me for a bit.

346
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,720
Kaan...

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,520
...he called himself.
As if he felt it in his bones.

348
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,760
<i>-Sister Leman?
</i>-Yes?

349
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,160
What's going on? Where is my father?
Is he with you?

350
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm giving the phone to him now,
talk to him yourself.

351
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,600
<i>Hello, dad?</i>

352
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,040
Hello, son.

353
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
It's nothing.

354
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,560
They bustled.
<i>I felt dizzy a little bit.</i>

355
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,400
<i>It's my blood pressure, you know.
</i>It's because of the heat.

356
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,000
Kaan, we are in the hospital.

357
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,200
<i>He fainted and he shivered and locked.
</i>The doctor said.

358
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,040
Dad, why are you not calling me
right away?

359
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,600
<i>Why would I call you, son?
</i>I just felt dizzy a little bit.

360
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,880
<i>We can't call you every time I sneeze,
</i>you are busy there.

361
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,680
Is it the blood pressure, dad?
I mean are you sure?

362
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,080
I know you.

363
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,080
I am going to call your doctor
and hear what's going on from her.

364
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,480
It's not going to happen this way.

365
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,160
Dad, can you give the phone
to sister Leman, please?

366
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,720
I am going to talk to her.
Have her send me the number of the doctor.

367
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,840
-Son, there is no need.
<i>-Dad, please.</i>

368
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,680
Don't object. Could you...

369
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,920
...could you give the phone
back to sister Leman?

370
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
Hello, Kaan.

371
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,040
Sister Leman...

372
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,720
...could you please send me
the number of the doctor?

373
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

374
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Let me go and ask for it, then.

375
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,800
I'll text you later on but...

376
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,000
...texting is really hard for me.

377
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,880
Anyway, maybe I'll call you
and say it myself.

378
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,480
Are we on the outs with each other?

379
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,720
Of course, we are.

380
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,840
Aren't you ashamed? A big man like you,
running away from the hospital.

381
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,600
Well, Leman, don't tire me out.

382
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Look at this beauty.

383
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,640
Let us enjoy this a little bit.

384
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,840
Stop talking about the hospital
and such.

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,360
Look...

386
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,760
...I hope you and that doctor
didn't make Kaan bustle.

387
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,120
Don't let the kid get away from his job.

388
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm saying this but...

389
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,400
...I made you get away
from your job today.

390
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,320
Don't talk crazy. There’s not much
business during the week anyway.

391
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,480
You were going to make 50 buns,
I'm talking about that.

392
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,680
Karma rocks.
It serves that Perihan right.

393
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,120
She's telling people that
she cooked the buns.

394
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,760
She should have made it herself today.

395
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,560
I hope she gave herself away.

396
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,760
I cannot believe this.

397
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,520
Hello.

398
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,920
I was just looking at that now.

399
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,480
Look, don't tell me you've liked it
or we'll be cross.

400
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,600
What is that?

401
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,440
She literally lifted the bag and
shoved it in the camera.

402
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,800
Of course, so that we can
see the brand.

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,320
She's so graceless.

404
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,120
Irem, close it down and
go back to your study.

405
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,560
Unbelievable, mom.

406
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
The school ends in 10 days,
what study are you talking about?

407
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,840
Okay, you can do it but
in a graceful way.

408
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,000
With that body like a log...
No, girl, they won't learn it.

409
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,600
I hate you.

410
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,280
I heard that. And your father will
hear it too when he comes.

411
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,520
Exactly, exactly.
They'll always be provincial.

412
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,320
Is it so hard to be a little bit graceful?

413
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,600
I'll tell you what.

414
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
It is the fault of the person
who brought them among us.

415
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,000
Ceren got cross with them,
and now we have to deal with them.

416
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,920
No, honey, it's too late.

417
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,400
We're going to make them grow distant
from us slowly.

418
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
My dad came.

419
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,520
I'm hanging up, kisses.

420
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,560
You are happy because
your saviour came but...

421
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,560
...still, you have to finish your study.

422
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,680
What is it, Kaan?

423
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,000
Is it about work?

424
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,880
What's this?

425
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,520
I don't know.
Fatos brought it.

426
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,760
Yea, we call it beetroot pickle.

427
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,680
They sent it from the village.
It's really good.

428
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,200
What are you doing?
What a shame!

429
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,800
Irem, you are really trying my patience.
Go and look after your brother.

430
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,680
Tell me, what's going on?

431
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,600
My dad fainted today.

432
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
Why?
How?

433
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,760
I don't know.

434
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,320
It's not his blood pressure or anything.

435
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,480
It's something else.
I talked to his doctor.

436
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,240
How is he now?

437
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,480
He's fine now.
He was being given serum and all.

438
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,720
The doctor wants to talk to me
face to face.

439
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,600
He couldn't stay there and
he ran away from the hospital.

440
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
Typical dad.

441
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,680
Wait, don't worry right away.

442
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,040
Maybe it's not something important.

443
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
Hello, Ozge...

444
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,840
You are buying me a ticket to Izmir
in the early hours like 7 o'clock.

445
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
From Ataturk airport.
Arrange a car for me...

446
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,640
...from the Izmir airport.
The car will be with me the whole day.

447
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,480
I will try to go and
come back in a day.

448
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,720
The return...

449
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
What shall we do about the return?
Arrange it for 6-7 o'clock.

450
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Okay, we'll talk tomorrow anyway.

451
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,680
By the way, you are going to
book the return tickets for two people.

452
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,440
You have my father's ID details, right?

453
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,480
Okay, you are buying for him.

454
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,520
Yes, he'll be in the business class too.

455
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,080
You do all of these and then
send me a screenshot.

456
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,360
I'll tell you later, okay.

457
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,600
What am I doing?

458
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,960
Yes, love, what are you doing really?

459
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,240
We should have sat down
and talked about it.

460
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,320
What can I do?
Shall I not go?

461
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,120
No, go, of course...

462
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,280
Anyway, wash your face,
get comfortable.

463
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,160
We'll talk after dinner.

464
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,320
<i>I hope you become 220 pounds, mom.</i>

465
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,880
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

466
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Dad.

467
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,760
The salt is here.
You've already brought it.

468
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
Sure.

469
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,440
Are you here?

470
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,800
These weren't eaten.

471
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,120
I thought I'd come here so that
we can eat it together.

472
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,840
-Are you available?
-I'm not.

473
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm going to go and ask for a girl's
hand in marriage.

474
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,640
Who would give their daughter to you,
you stubborn goat!

475
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,440
I think you remembered
your deceased father.

476
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,200
Don't open that subject now.

477
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,120
You made mousaka, good.

478
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,040
Let me make a salad right away.

479
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,720
Hello, friends.

480
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,040
Welcome to my channel.

481
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm going to play my new song
for you today.

482
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,920
As you all know,
I'm not very good at the guitar but...

483
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,040
...I'm still trying.

484
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,400
I hope you like it.

485
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,840
The lyrics belong to me too.

486
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,440
By the way, girls,
don't forget that...

487
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,920
...we are making a good luck charm
this evening.

488
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,120
I hope one of the great Amazons,
I mean, in music...

489
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,400
...one of the whole women warriors
can hear me.

490
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,400
Tell me the truth.

491
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,040
You and the doctor,
you didn't ask Kaan to come here, right?

492
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,120
Yes, we did.

493
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,640
I am relieved now.

494
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,880
What about it?

495
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,120
You'll get to see your son.
Is that bad?

496
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,280
Didn't you miss your son?

497
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,560
I missed him,
how can one not miss his child?

498
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,280
Look, every cloud has a silver lining.

499
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
They've been saying they’re going to come
for these past two summers...

500
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,040
...but they didn't.

501
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,360
Somehow, they managed to go to Bodrum,
Dalyan, though.

502
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
They kept putting photos up...

503
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
...from the ships and the yachts.

504
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,200
Didn't I see it?
I did.

505
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,640
It's all because of that sinister-looking
bride but I'm not saying it.

506
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,240
I'm sorry but...

507
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,800
...no one should ignore their father
this much.

508
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,480
He has a job, what can he do?

509
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,840
He made his life with great difficulty.

510
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,400
He dealt with so many things.

511
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,520
I am proud of him.

512
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,120
He was this big...

513
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,800
...when his mother passed away.

514
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,480
Now, let's give you your right.

515
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,080
You raised him.
You were a sister to him but...

516
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,720
...it's hard being
without a mother, Leman.

517
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,520
He didn't bend his head for once.

518
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,840
He didn't upset me for once.

519
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,600
While everybody's sons would
break glasses, stone dogs...

520
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
...he...

521
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,840
...stayed at this table.

522
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,240
He studied his lessons.

523
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,160
I am proud of him.

524
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,560
You be proud of him, too.

525
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,160
I am, dear.
Why wouldn't I?

526
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,480
Be.

527
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,240
-You count as his mother.
-I do, don't I?

528
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,640
See, this is our destiny.

529
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
Some of them are gone...

530
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,040
...it's just us now at this table...

531
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,840
...talking about the dead and the living.

532
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,840
It didn't happen like that,
it happened like this.

533
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
Thank God for this, too.

534
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,160
Turns out we have...

535
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,480
...come to help each other
out into this world.

536
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,080
Thank God for this.

537
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,120
Oh, well...

538
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,280
...you made me cry.
I'm going.

539
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,240
Don't drink too much, okay?

540
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,840
Or if you do, I'll scratch your eyes out.

541
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,960
Go to sleep, have some rest.

542
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,600
Kaan is coming tomorrow morning.

543
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,520
We talked, you'll be in my place,
father and son.

544
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,000
He'll be in my place at 9.

545
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,040
Well, I'm going now.

546
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,240
Where are you going?
We were having a nice conversation.

547
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,040
-We'll talk later on, you're tired.
-You know.

548
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,000
-Good night to you.
-Good night to you too.

549
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,720
Hello, Ozge, I've just landed.
How are things there?

550
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,960
Is she coming too?

551
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,360
She was going to send
her assistant?

552
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,720
Let's do it like this,
you gather the group, you start...

553
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,040
...and video call me
two minutes later, okay?

554
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,920
No, tell the truth!

555
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,120
Tell them his father got sick
and that it was urgent.

556
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,520
Exaggerate the situation.
Create a case of victimhood.

557
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,280
Turn the situation to our advantage.
Believe me, it's not so hard, Ozge.

558
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,120
I'll be on the road for one
and a half hours.

559
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,240
You start the talk,
and then call me right away.

560
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,080
Okay?
Okay, bye.

561
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,120
Dad...

562
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
...a tie?

563
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,080
A tie, right?

564
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,360
No need, you are not going
to the shop anymore.

565
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,320
Dad...

566
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,560
...the wallet.

567
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,640
<i>Your work cannot be wasted on
a Sunday night.</i>

568
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,360
We have a very good first episode
in our hands.

569
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,920
You know my notes.

570
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,120
There are some filling scenes
we want to add.

571
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,800
If they are shot, too...

572
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,800
...this will be a fantastic episode.

573
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,360
<i>Mr. Kaan, our director is
sending you his greetings.</i>

574
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,280
<i>He is in the set right now.</i>

575
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,200
<i>He is very sure of the scenes
he has shot.</i>

576
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,000
<i>He thinks there is no need
for any additional scenes.</i>

577
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,160
<i>He thinks that it would lower the tempo
in the first episode...</i>

578
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,560
<i>...and that we should trust the
viewers' intelligence a little bit.</i>

579
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,760
Is that so?

580
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,440
Miss Zeynep,
let me put it like this...

581
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,960
...in our profession...

582
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,840
...I've always ignored the
viewers' intelligence completely.

583
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,760
The thing you are telling me doesn't
exist. It's a made up world.

584
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,280
If there was that intelligence,
we'd be doing something else now.

585
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,080
I'm sorry but this is how it is.

586
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,920
He is a young,
enthusiastic friend of ours...

587
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720
...but I cannot throw away a project
that's worth a billion...

588
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,960
...out of the street, just because of that
enthusiasm on making art.

589
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,320
It'd make you lose money and
it'd make us lose time.

590
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,360
If need be, we can show him the door
and find another friend ...

591
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,400
...who can do the job and
make us get the ratings.

592
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,320
<i>Is it ringing, is it busy?
I don't understand who he's talking to.</i>

593
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,160
Look, maybe he called you.

594
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,000
It says there is a missed call.

595
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,800
See, you never hear it.

596
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,120
Adnan, the cheesemaker.

597
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,520
What is this?

598
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,280
Why would Adnan call me?
He sees me every day.

599
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,720
Turn right and stop on the pavement
on the left.

600
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm sorry I have to hang up now.

601
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,840
We'll talk about these face to face
when I come back.

602
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,640
Don't worry,
everything will be great.

603
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,360
They arrived.
Go and welcome them.

604
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,480
Don't forget,
it's all for the sake of our job.

605
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,640
You get on with it now.
May it be easy.

606
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,040
Dad.

607
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,440
Son.

608
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,120
Are you okay, dad?

609
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,840
I am.

610
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,600
Welcome, welcome.

611
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,520
Welcome, my boy.

612
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,040
We have been waiting
for a long time.

613
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, dear, welcome.

614
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,720
Come on, come.
Come on in.

615
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,240
You are hungry, right?

616
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
Come in.
We'll have breakfast together.

617
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,720
No, brother, thank you.
I am full.

618
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,160
Have a cup of tea at least.

619
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
-I'll deal with it.
-Dad, come.

620
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,600
Salih, bring a chair.

621
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,760
Sister Leman,
can you show me the socket?

622
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,680
-Well, it's normal.
-Excuse me?

623
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
I'll deal with it.
You sit down.

624
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,520
Shall I give you a cup of tea?

625
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,120
I'll have coffee, please.

626
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,960
I bought the machine.

627
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,640
I can make those
fashionable things now.

628
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,800
Latte, espresso, cappuccino.

629
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,680
I learned the names
and the machine but...

630
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,840
...it has been too difficult.

631
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
I'll have a double espresso, then.

632
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,920
Sister Leman...

633
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,360
...he looks well but how is he?

634
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,720
We'll talk later on.

635
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,200
Has the shop changed?

636
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,760
I don't know.

637
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,560
But it looks really good,
that's for sure.

638
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,120
I'll give him this and come back.
The boy must be hungry.

639
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,120
Young man...

640
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,960
...take this.

641
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
Why didn't you come in?

642
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,600
Everything changes in this life...

643
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,600
...except my father.
I know that.

644
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,160
-Uncle?
-Dad!

645
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,400
<i>We can't impose sanction
on the patients, unfortunately.</i>

646
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
<i>You father is the sweetest man but...</i>

647
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,760
...he is a bit interesting.

648
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,400
-You know better, of course.
-Well, he is.

649
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,240
I couldn't diagnose neither his character
nor his illness.

650
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
We had a hard time giving him the serum
that day.

651
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,400
He just left.

652
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,960
It's a bit your duty too.

653
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,600
Can't you take a few days off from work
and stay here?

654
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,040
No.

655
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,840
It's not possible.

656
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,400
No, son.

657
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,600
What do you mean no?
It's your house too.

658
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,200
You have your order in the house.
You have your wife and your kids.

659
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,440
I'd be a burden to you there.

660
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,760
Dad, why did you say that?

661
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,840
I can't leave this place.
I've got business here.

662
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,960
I've got things to do in the house.

663
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,600
There's Dudu and there's you.

664
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,120
Me?

665
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,080
Dad, I won't be able to stay.

666
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,640
That's why I'm taking you with me.

667
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,320
-I didn't say that.
-What did you say?

668
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,560
Don't worry about Dudu.
I will look after her like she's mine.

669
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,160
She'd be a friend to me in the shop.

670
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,800
You are not going to be there forever.

671
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,080
What's with the gloom?
Surely, you'll come back.

672
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,480
Dad, your grandchildren.

673
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,920
Look, Uras grew up.

674
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,640
The last time you saw him,
he was a baby.

675
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,080
Haven't you missed them at all?

676
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,880
I have.

677
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
You were going to bring them
last summer?

678
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,440
I really long for them.

679
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
Then?

680
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,240
I'd be an extra there.

681
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,840
I'd give you trouble.

682
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,200
My child, human flesh is heavy to bear.

683
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,200
Dad, I'd carry you on my shoulders
if it came to that.

684
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,240
Okay?

685
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,800
Agreed?

686
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,000
Okay, we're done.

687
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,640
Come on, let's prepare your suitcase.

688
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,240
I'll take these.

689
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,680
-Don't forget the key.
-I've got the key, don't worry.

690
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,640
The car is there, Mr. Kaan,
it can't make it to the street.

691
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,320
Don't feed her with the same thing
every day.

692
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,280
You are going to give her roasted and
salted sunflower seed and red apple.

693
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,680
Put her in a place where
she can see the street.

694
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,880
She likes the spaciousness.

695
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,600
Don't worry.
I'll look up on the internet...

696
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,720
...I'll write parrot care and
learn all of it by heart, don't worry.

697
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,160
She is not like the others.

698
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
You are going to talk to her.

699
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,920
You are going to have a heart-to-heart
talk with her. Don't forget.

700
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,040
I won't.

701
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,280
That's it.
Don't you ever forget.

702
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
I won't.

703
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Dad, come on.

704
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,120
We're expecting good news from you.

705
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,520
Godspeed.

706
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,720
I entrust him to you.
Come and go with best luck.

707
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,960
Okay, Miss Dudu.

708
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,679
See you later.

709
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,920
Oh, my beautiful Izmir.

710
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,000
It shakes like this from time to time.

711
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,400
You are not afraid, right?

712
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,920
I was a parachute jumper in the military.
Have you forgotten?

713
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,560
Why would I be afraid?
Let the plane be afraid of me.

714
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Right.

715
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,719
A strange uneasiness has come
over me lately.

716
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,480
After the kids were born.

717
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,199
When you have a child,
you think of them, right?

718
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,520
Are you going to read all of this?

719
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,080
Unfortunately.

720
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,720
You do your work.

721
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,520
I am comfortable here.
All is good.

722
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,240
I wish I had taken the front seat.

723
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,400
We both sat in the back,
it'll be a disgrace to the man.

724
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,960
It's a showy car.

725
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,640
Son, was there any need for all
this expenditure?

726
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,240
Dad, it is the car of the company.

727
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,040
They must be the ones giving
the driver his pay check, then.

728
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,760
That's good, then.

729
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,200
Sound the horn like this,
all of you.

730
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,840
As if the road will be cleared
when you sound the horn.

731
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,640
See their line of thinking!

732
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,320
We should go to Kordon,
to Pasaport tomorrow and have some tea.

733
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,120
We haven't been there in ages.

734
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,360
Dad...

735
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,240
...we are in Istanbul, not Izmir.

736
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,720
Of course.

737
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Mrs. Ece, I'm leaving?
Are you saying anything?

738
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
I've been out all day,
I couldn't talk to you.

739
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,920
Actually, there is something.

740
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,080
Don't be afraid,
It's nothing important.

741
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
Kaan, he's bringing his dad.

742
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,160
He's going to stay here for a while.

743
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,440
I don't know for how long.

744
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
He's going to take him
to the doctor and all.

745
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,360
-I hope he gets better soon.
-Thank you.

746
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,040
That's why you’re going to be spending
more time with us.

747
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,480
-Talk to those in your house.
-I will.

748
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,520
I'll tell them, it won't be a problem.

749
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,400
Look, if it's going to be hard for you,
I can arrange an assistant for you.

750
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,960
No.
I can do it myself.

751
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,560
Okay, if you say so.

752
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,160
Then, let me put another plate
on the table.

753
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,360
Okay, I'll do it.

754
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,400
-We're here.
-Welcome.

755
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
Thank you.

756
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,040
How was your journey?

757
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,200
It was good, we flew like a bird.

758
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,640
People are like birds.

759
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Thank you, thank you.

760
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,920
Thank you, my girl, thank you.

761
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,000
There you go.

762
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,000
That's very nice of you. I forgot to put
my slippers because of hurry.

763
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,440
I'm sorry it's not your size
but I'll deal with it.

764
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,080
-You are Fatos, right?
-Yea, I am Fatos.

765
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,160
Thank you, my girl.

766
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,440
Where are my grandchildren?

767
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,920
My girl, look, your grandfather has come.

768
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,360
Uras is sleeping, he'll be waking up soon.
I'll bring him.

769
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,640
And Irem must have her headphones on.

770
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,960
I'll bring her now.

771
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,160
-You go ahead.
-Come, dad.

772
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,520
Let me wash my hands and my face.

773
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,600
Come, take a breath,
you can do it later.

774
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,280
Irem, Irem!

775
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,040
Your grandfather has come.
Come along.

776
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,560
Your grandfather has come, run.

777
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,160
-She has come.
-Welcome, granddad.

778
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,840
Praise be!

779
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,440
She grew up
and became a young girl in two years.

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
We're talking on the phone but
you can't tell.

781
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,520
And you put pictures on that thing,
Leman is showing me but...

782
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,800
...when I see you like this now,
Look, how beautiful you are.

783
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,160
Really?

784
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,080
And you look very stylish.

785
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,600
Come on, take me to the boy,...

786
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,320
...I'll take a look at him
without waking him up.

787
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,920
Okay.
You are talking funny again.

788
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,400
How is it funny?

789
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,880
You can leave, Fatos.

790
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,280
Let me cook the other fish
and then leave.

791
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,520
Praise be! Look at my grandson.

792
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,880
He sleeps, he wakes up.
That's what he does.

793
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,880
And he thinks he's talking but
he's making ridiculous noises.

794
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,800
Is that a way to talk about your brother?

795
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,480
He's little now, he'll learn.

796
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,280
This is very showy.
Are you playing it?

797
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,960
Well, I'm learning.

798
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,040
If I can find a chance
because of my mother.

799
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,040
I was cross with them for three days,
I didn't talk to both of them.

800
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,160
Then, they had to buy the guitar.

801
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,760
Actually, my mother told me to take
piano lessons but...

802
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,200
...I am into guitars.
I have a free spirit.

803
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,000
I've been obsessed with the flower
children of the 60's, 70's lately.

804
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,160
Janis Joplin and so on.

805
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,320
And we have Sena Sener here.

806
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,480
She wrote her first song
when she was 15.

807
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,360
I want to write my own songs like her.

808
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,520
I have 2-3 years.

809
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,880
And then there is my Nazan.

810
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,760
The way she says
“let's go away from here.”

811
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,320
I know, she says
“let's go away from here.”

812
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,480
Truly, granddad,
let's go away from here.

813
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,120
Let's go to a world that is more just.

814
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,600
Let's leave this place.

815
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,280
Praise be, girl,
you know so many things.

816
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,120
Go on, play for me,
Let me have a listen.

817
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,120
Granddad,
you must be loving us truly.

818
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,000
Why wouldn't I, girl?
Why would you say such a thing?

819
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,760
You are really valuable for me.

820
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,880
Take it.

821
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,760
Irem, to dinner, come on.

822
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,320
Take your granddad with you too.

823
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,440
We're coming, we're coming.

824
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,280
Son, my child.

825
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,440
He's very quiet.
Can't he talk yet?

826
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,760
He's going to talk a bit late,
they say it's a sign of intelligence.

827
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,080
I mean he refuses to talk as long as
he can't talk as good as us.

828
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,720
You are talking to him, right?

829
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,320
He can't learn otherwise.

830
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,120
Sure, for example, I have a session
with him every morning for half an hour.

831
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,240
But he only learned to say “yea”.
And that's from Fatos.

832
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,600
You eat your food.

833
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,720
Wait, let me give you some.

834
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,920
We are not strangers, my girl.
I am your father.

835
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,040
Of course, daddy.

836
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,880
Irem, you still haven't touched anything
on your plate. Let's not start again.

837
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,640
Mom, I don't like salmon.

838
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,560
Irem, you're going to eat everything
in that plate, okay?

839
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,680
Dad, I already have an extra four pounds.

840
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,120
Who, you?

841
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,680
My girl, you look like a garpike.
What extra are you talking about?

842
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,040
What's a garpike?

843
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,080
Garpike is a kind of fish.

844
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,240
If you use it to refer to a person,
it means that the person is thin, skinny.

845
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,680
Gars or garpike are members of the
Lepisosteiformes...

846
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,240
...they're found in warm
and hot waters, and--

847
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,160
Irem!

848
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,760
Enough is enough!
You are doing this not to eat your food.

849
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,880
Come on, eat it.
Don't play with your food.

850
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,840
Look how delicious things
your mom has cooked.

851
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,640
She didn't cook them.
Fatos did.

852
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,600
Irem, they are cooking together.

853
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,400
You're just saying so because
you want my granddad to think so.

854
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,000
-I'm not buying it.
-Irem!

855
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,560
Son.

856
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,280
-Irem, come back to the table.
-Son.

857
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,280
Dad, I'm sorry.

858
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,440
She's become so impertinent lately.

859
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,680
She's making me do the things
I wouldn't do.

860
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,240
She is young, of course,
things like this will happen.

861
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,000
You should take the path of
least resistance a little bit.

862
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,320
My girl, take Uras.

863
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,680
My girl, what happened to you?

864
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,200
-Did something make you ill?
-No.

865
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,200
-Please, don't let my mother know.
-We all ate the same thing.

866
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,240
-Don't ever tell my mom about this.
-Okay.

867
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,040
I won't, my girl.

868
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,080
What happened, granddad?

869
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,200
Granddad?

870
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,880
Are you okay?
What happened? What is it?

871
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,880
Irem...

872
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,160
...what are you doing here?

873
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,600
Nothing.

874
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
My granddad was consoling me.

875
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,320
She's okay now.

876
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,920
She was a bit angry at her father.

877
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,840
Go on, girl.

878
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,640
Go on, go this way.

879
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm managing the whole farm
and the city.

880
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,680
My dad lets me play it
for half an hour every day.

881
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,840
Because it grows
my commercial intelligence.

882
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,960
We put these on the plane and
earn money.

883
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,440
Look, the train has come.

884
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,720
They want tomatoes.

885
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,880
So, this means we are going to sow
the tomatoes in the soil...

886
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,360
...and wait for it to grow
for two hours.

887
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,640
They will be uploaded tomorrow.

888
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,520
My girl, can you grow tomatoes there?

889
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,080
You should plant the tomato in the soil.

890
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,040
I already know the man but
I thought I'd not call at this hour.

891
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,480
Do you know how many days
you have to wait?

892
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,440
It also needs watering and fertilizer.

893
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,160
This is a game of it.

894
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,480
I know it's a game but what use it is
as long as you can't eat it!

895
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,960
You come to me and we'll plant
the real one with you in our garden.

896
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,680
Really?

897
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,800
Dad...

898
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,000
...your appointment is arranged
for tomorrow.

899
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,440
The doctor's appointment.

900
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,120
You make up with your daughter and
I'll see the doctor tomorrow.

901
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,920
Why, what happened?

902
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,520
Okay, you are forgiven.

903
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,040
We are going to get up early
tomorrow morning, dad.

904
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,640
This is a very valuable professor.

905
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,400
He'll do a thorough check up.

906
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,960
What happened, granddad?
Are you sick?

907
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,280
No, it's a general check-up.

908
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,600
Don't worry.

909
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,360
It's nothing, my beautiful girl.
I am as fit as a flea.

910
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,240
Don't you have turnip in that game?
Go on, plant some.

911
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,800
Irem, come on, it's time to go to bed.

912
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,840
You got really tired all day.

913
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,760
Let me show you your room
if you want to rest.

914
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,320
Okay, thank you.

915
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,720
Here it is.

916
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,640
We didn't touch your suitcases
so as not to give you discomfort.

917
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,280
You can settle yourself.

918
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,880
Dad, you have a bathroom here.
It'll make you feel comfortable.

919
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,600
We put some clean towels, as well.

920
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,960
All is good.

921
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,840
You can call out
if you need anything.

922
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,400
No, what would I need?

923
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,480
-Good night.
-Good night, my girl.

924
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,840
It's showy, praise be.

925
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,160
Good.

926
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,560
Dad, your water is here.

927
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,440
-If you get thirsty during the night.
-Okay.

928
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,120
Shall I turn on the television?
Maybe you'll fall asleep with it.

929
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,320
No, there's no need.
I'll fall asleep, don't worry.

930
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,680
I almost forgot.

931
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,400
Sister Leman sent a picture.

932
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,520
-What was the name of your parrot?
-Dudu.

933
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,320
Look, she sent a picture of Dudu.

934
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,760
She put her in a showy spot.

935
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,680
She's enjoying herself.

936
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,800
Dudu girl, why have you
forgotten me so fast?

937
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,120
Thank her.

938
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,200
-Okay, then, I--
-Son...

939
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,800
...don't think about me.

940
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,800
I'll be sleeping tonight,
being proud of you.

941
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,240
It's true, right?

942
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,840
You came here with a suitcase.

943
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,120
Istanbul is a big city.

944
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,960
It could spit one out on the floor when
the occasion arises.

945
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,000
But, look...

946
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,920
...you settled down, your wife,
your children, your job.

947
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,360
You did all of these on your own.

948
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,720
I am proud of you.

949
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,240
Thank you, dad.

950
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,640
Thanks to you.

951
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,400
-Well, then, goodnight.
-Goodnight.

952
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,960
<i>Istanbul is a big city.
It spits one out on the floor.</i>

953
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,640
I'll be worried about you.

954
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,040
Don't go, son.

955
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,440
Why is Izmir not enough?
It's very close.

956
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,640
Dad, like I told you...

957
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,120
...I can't do my job here.

958
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,520
Did I study for four years for nothing?

959
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,640
There are three tiny, local channels.

960
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,920
You can't grow in your job here.

961
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,440
So you insist on drowning
in the big sea.

962
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,040
What can I say?
You know.

963
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,800
She slammed the door and left.

964
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,280
She said she doesn't want to see
them ever again.

965
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,040
She said may you get no benefit from
the bracelet and the money.

966
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,280
I called, it was off.
I sent a message to Kaan.

967
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,400
We've arrived.

968
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,960
You know they make us turn our
phones off in the plane.

969
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,600
<i>You are good, right?
Are you comfortable?</i>

970
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,360
I am good.
Don't worry about me.

971
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,200
How are your grandchildren?
They must have grown up.

972
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,720
That's why I called.

973
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,920
<i>Say it.</i>

974
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,600
I've found Irem a little strange
this time.

975
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,160
What do you mean?

976
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,000
<i>She had a row with her father.
She got angry, left the table.</i>

977
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,600
<i>She went to the bathroom. </i>I saw her
making herself throw up with her finger.

978
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,080
I hope it's not something psychological.

979
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,720
Like she's punishing herself
because of her anger.

980
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,360
She is so thin.

981
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,120
She made me swear so I can't tell her
mother or father.

982
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,800
Really?

983
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,800
Why?

984
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,760
<i>Some girls do you know what these days.</i>

985
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,560
They throw up what they eat to stay thin.

986
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,520
That sickness has a name.

987
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,560
Blum-blom or something like that.

988
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,840
I don't remember now.

989
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,440
I'll look it up and call you.

990
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,920
What can we do about it?

991
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,920
I don't know what to do, either.

992
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,160
It was very hurtful to see that, Leman.
She is a tiny girl.

993
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,760
What happened?
Don't step on it, don't!

994
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,160
Kaan, what's going on?

995
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,960
Irem is here.
My dad?

996
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,360
Dad?

997
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,000
Ece, call the ambulance!

998
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,520
-Call the ambulance!
-Okay.

999
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,280
-Is he breathing?
-Fatos, bring water.

1000
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,880
Come on, sit there.

1001
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,080
Well...

1002
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,120
...there is no need for fear or worry.

1003
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,960
Everyone keeps telling me
not to be afraid.

1004
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,640
I'm sorry but I owe God one lifetime.

1005
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,080
Am I going to be afraid of that?

1006
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,480
You tell me.

1007
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,120
What did you find in me?

1008
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,760
Is it dementia?

1009
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,320
What's the rush?
We can't diagnose right away.

1010
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,600
Let's see the film first.

1011
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,000
Turns out everyone's so eager to
shoot my film.

1012
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,280
If I'd known,
I'd be an artist and even get paid for it.

1013
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,400
<i>Mr. Kaan, I'm going to guide
you to a centre that is very close.</i>

1014
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,040
<i>In fact, it is within walking distance.</i>

1015
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,200
<i>They are going to take
a tomography scan and MR.</i>

1016
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,560
<i>They'll send me the results.</i>

1017
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,960
<i>Today is an extremely busy day.</i>

1018
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,760
<i>I have two operations during the day.</i>

1019
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,680
<i>I'll get back to you tomorrow at worst.</i>

1020
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,520
<i>We are going to really speed up
this process.</i>

1021
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,120
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1022
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,120
Oh, dad.

1023
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,320
Love, we've just walked out,
we are at the door. Where are you?

1024
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,920
<i>I've just driven into the street.</i>

1025
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,440
-Okay, I've seen you.
<i>-I've seen you.</i>

1026
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,600
Dad, Ece will take you home.

1027
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,600
I have to go to work from here.

1028
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,360
Look, this doctor is an interesting man.

1029
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,720
He is the best in his field.

1030
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,560
So don't worry about anything, okay?

1031
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,880
I'll see you in the evening.

1032
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,560
Okay, don't worry.

1033
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,320
-Hello.
-Hi, love.

1034
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,720
-I hope you get well soon.
-Thank you, my girl.

1035
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,960
Love, I entrust him to you.

1036
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,520
Okay, don't worry about us.

1037
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,720
May it be easy.

1038
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,480
-I'll see you in the evening.
-Thank you.

1039
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,760
I'm sorry, my girl.

1040
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,520
I've given you so much trouble.

1041
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,520
Dad, is that a thing to say now?

1042
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,680
I'm glad the kids
didn't wake up in the morning.

1043
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,200
Anyway, we're all human here.

1044
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,640
What did the doctor say?

1045
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,960
He can't tell yet.
He's going to call us tomorrow.

1046
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
As long as you are good.

1047
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,600
What are you looking at, what?
Drive on!

1048
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,720
Can we stop there for a second?

1049
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,120
How can I stop in the middle of the road?

1050
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,440
Why? What happened?

1051
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,400
Very well, then, it wasn't fated to be.

1052
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,360
Pass.
Pass.

1053
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,520
What?

1054
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,120
I'm buying a sack of soil!
Am I buying a land?

1055
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,360
What is this?

1056
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,480
Our prices are standard, sir.

1057
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,600
Okay, then.

1058
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,000
Give me one of those, then.

1059
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,680
I also want a flowerpot but...

1060
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,920
...I don't want it to be plastic
like this.

1061
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,920
It is for a girl child,
I want something showy.

1062
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,400
This will do it.

1063
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,640
Take this too.

1064
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,680
What are those?
What did you buy?

1065
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,400
You leave it, I'll carry it.

1066
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,720
-Where can we put them now?
-You leave it, I'll carry it.

1067
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,520
-Welcome.
-Thank you, my girl.

1068
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,920
Put it here, son, put it here.

1069
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,560
We gave you trouble.
Thank you.

1070
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,880
-Good day to you.
-Good day to you.

1071
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,360
-Good day to you, thank you.

1072
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,560
What are these, Mrs. Ece?

1073
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,680
We've brought you some soil in case
you may miss your village.

1074
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,840
What's this?
You haven't cleared the table yet.

1075
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,000
Mr. Esref hasn't eaten anything yet.

1076
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,120
Okay.

1077
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,760
My head isn't clear.

1078
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,240
You go on and have breakfast, then.

1079
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,680
I'll be back right away.

1080
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,760
Thank you, my girl.
I gave you trouble.

1081
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,560
Don't mention it.

1082
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,160
She makes fun of me like that sometimes.

1083
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,440
I mean Mrs. Ece.

1084
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,600
Don't be troubled because of me.

1085
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,800
I've been coming to clean
Mr. Kaan's house since he was a bachelor.

1086
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,120
It's been years.

1087
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,480
But she doesn't want me here anymore.

1088
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,200
She wants to send me.
I know.

1089
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,200
Why, my girl?

1090
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,800
It is so.

1091
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,680
She wants someone
more modern instead of me.

1092
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,360
She says she is embarrassed
when guests come.

1093
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,960
And I am a bad example to kids.

1094
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,440
She says I'm not a good "lore" model.
Whatever that means!

1095
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,840
I hear them talking.

1096
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,640
Mr. Kaan always shuts her up.

1097
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,960
He doesn't send me for the sake
of the old days.

1098
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,480
Look, brother Esref,
Let me tell you something.

1099
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,080
Your son is a really good person.

1100
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,040
I'm dealing with her for his sake.

1101
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,920
You raised him so well.
Thank you so much.

1102
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,360
Thank you, my girl.
Don't--

1103
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,520
<i>One day!</i>

1104
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,720
I wasn't here for one day and
it's all turned into a mess.

1105
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,000
Where is the script?
Is it this one?

1106
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,320
This is not even half of the episode.

1107
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,720
Did five people write 50 pages
in two days?

1108
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,040
-What kind of a disgrace is this, Ozge?
-We tried to push them, Mr. Kaan.

1109
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:01,200
But they weren't pushed, Ozge! If they’d
been pushed, it wouldn't be like this.

1110
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,720
Go out, not now.

1111
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:06,000
You are going to wait on them
with a whip if need be.

1112
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,800
These are the writers' group,
these guys are relaxed.

1113
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,360
Haven't you still figured it out
in all these years?

1114
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,760
Let's give them some bits
from the old episodes this week.

1115
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,440
Let's chase away those
who are giving advertisements.

1116
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,120
And then close the shop.

1117
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,440
You are alive, I'm well.
Great.

1118
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,520
Hello.

1119
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,720
<i>Are you available?</i>

1120
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,600
Yes, is everything okay?

1121
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,120
I guess so.

1122
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,720
You guess so?

1123
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,040
Well, I don't know.

1124
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,840
Your dad made me stop the car suddenly.

1125
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,120
We bought a sack of soil, a flowerpot and
a seedling on our way back.

1126
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,120
Why?

1127
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,440
I didn't ask why.

1128
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,400
The man wanted it,
and I didn't object.

1129
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,880
He needs to be happy after all, right?

1130
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,200
Ece, I don't understand
what you are trying to say.

1131
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,000
What did I say now, love?

1132
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,600
I'm just telling you what went on.

1133
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,240
-Well, okay, then.
<i>-Actually, I called for this.</i>

1134
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,960
We were going to invite Mr. Ilker and his wife
to dinner, you asked me to remind you.

1135
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,920
Oh, God.

1136
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,040
I forgot all about that.

1137
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
Shall we postpone it?

1138
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,400
Kaan, we talked about this.

1139
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,800
Let's keep it close since
the offer is still fresh.

1140
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,920
Let's invite them in,
It would be too formal if it's outside.

1141
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,280
<i>And we were going to meet his wife.
You told me all these.</i>

1142
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,720
What about my father?

1143
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,600
He'd sit with us a little bit
and then go to his room.

1144
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,240
I mean if you like.

1145
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,400
<i>Don't think about these things now.
I'll arrange it.</i>

1146
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,680
By the way, I'm going to invite my mother
<i>and her husband to dinner too.</i>

1147
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,760
<i>So that we are crowded.</i>

1148
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,000
Your mother and his husband.

1149
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,680
Yes. We'll have to put up with them
for a night.

1150
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,360
Let's save the appearance.

1151
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,520
Love...

1152
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,200
...I have no problem with them.
You don't like them.

1153
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,400
I wonder why.

1154
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,440
Anyway, we'll talk about these later.

1155
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,840
Please remind Mr. Ilker.

1156
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,360
Okay, I'll ask him when I see him.

1157
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,160
<i>Okay, kisses.</i>

1158
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,720
It's good.

1159
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,320
-My girl, isn't there a newspaper around?
-No.

1160
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,080
They read on the...
Tablet.

1161
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,600
There's a magazine,
shall I give it to you?

1162
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,280
I'll take it.
Don't bother.

1163
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,680
I'm sorry I had some things to do.

1164
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,720
Oh, God, is my Uras pasha here?

1165
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,960
-Come here, come.
-Go to granddad.

1166
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,640
-You didn't get bored, did you?
-No, my girl, I am okay.

1167
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,240
Fatos, why don't you turn on the
television?

1168
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,680
He didn't want it.

1169
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,160
I asked him but he said it's giving him
headache.

1170
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,320
Shall I give you a painkiller?

1171
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,960
No, my girl, I am good.

1172
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,000
What are you doing, my pasha?
Are you okay, my pasha?

1173
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,600
Oh, he's smiling.

1174
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,600
Oh, you, yellow balls, you.

1175
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,880
I'm sorry, my girl.

1176
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,200
This is how they love a child
in my hometown. It just popped out.

1177
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,440
My girl, go and sit down.

1178
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,840
Don't stand up.

1179
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,200
-My girl, eat your food.
-I am eating, dad.

1180
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,080
It just stays there on your plate.

1181
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,320
Do you really like Nazan Oncel?

1182
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,320
Yes, granddad.

1183
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,640
All the female poets represent my spirit.

1184
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,880
Their own lyrics, their own songs.

1185
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,960
They are the insurgents
in a man's world.

1186
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,120
Go girl.

1187
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,520
Look, let's make a deal.

1188
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,120
If you finish the food on your plate...

1189
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,240
...I'm going to tell you a story
about her.

1190
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,920
Nobody knows this,
not even your father.

1191
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,120
I know her.

1192
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,640
She calls me in bairams
and we talk.

1193
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,760
Granddad, come on?

1194
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,840
How do you know her?
Me is shocked right now.

1195
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,440
Girl, why are you talking
like a foreigner?

1196
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,440
Ece, wait a second.

1197
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,680
Tell us more, dad.

1198
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,040
I think it was 1996.

1199
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,800
You weren't born then.

1200
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,920
Your father was going to university
in those days.

1201
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,480
In my hometown, we celebrate the salvation
from the enemy occupation...

1202
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,600
...each year on September 11.

1203
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,080
Parade in the morning...

1204
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,080
...entertainment with music
in the evening.

1205
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:21,080
On the day of the salvation, they set up
a stage in front of the city hall.

1206
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,080
Everyone goes to that entertainment.

1207
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,800
Anyway, let me spit it out.

1208
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,160
They said that Nazan was coming that year.

1209
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,000
She was just beginning to be
famous back then.

1210
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,160
We would hear her name a lot.

1211
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,880
She and her orchestra land
on the Izmir airport...

1212
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,280
...and they see that
Nazan's suitcase is lost.

1213
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,160
The dress she's going to wear
in the concert is in the suitcase, too.

1214
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,120
So she won't be able to wear it.

1215
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,200
Because they say the suitcase would only
come the day after.

1216
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,480
They tell her “let's buy you a ready-made
dress from Izmir.”

1217
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,200
She says no. She says it's better if I go
on stage with what I'm wearing now.

1218
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,120
That is exactly a move she would make.

1219
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,480
Anyway, do you know
how I know about all of these?

1220
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,200
They go downtown in the morning...

1221
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,840
...Nazan sees my shop.

1222
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,160
It's an old tailor's shop,
so she likes it.

1223
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,840
You saw me there too.

1224
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,600
You came to the shop and saw it.
I am an old tailor.

1225
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,920
Yes, it was quite a retro shop.

1226
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,720
Anyway, let me spit it out.

1227
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,640
She said so when she was there.

1228
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,640
She heard about our art
from the neighbours.

1229
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,200
I told her “since you came all this way
for us...

1230
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,880
...let me sew you a dress...

1231
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,320
...you don't have to wear
it if you don't like it.”

1232
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,720
She said she doesn't want it.

1233
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,960
I insisted so she said yes.

1234
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,280
We left my shop...

1235
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,120
...and went to Mehmet's variety shop.

1236
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,320
You should have seen us running.

1237
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,440
Our feet were hitting our bottom.

1238
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,880
We went into the shop,
I asked her to pick a cloth.

1239
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,320
“Pick a cloth, Miss Nazan.”

1240
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,840
We picked a thin one.
It was a chally and it was purple.

1241
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,880
I took her measurements right there.
I guess it was 11 in the morning.

1242
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,200
She went to her rehearsal.

1243
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,880
She came back in the evening and
her dress was ready.

1244
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,040
I sewed her a thin, modern dress.

1245
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,160
It was very showy.
She really liked it.

1246
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,160
She gave me a hug and said
“God bless your hands, thank you.”

1247
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,480
She asked me to want something,
anything from her.

1248
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,520
I said “Now that I've seen the light in
your eyes, I don't want money or anything.

1249
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,000
But I'll take a benediction from you...

1250
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,160
...and that would be more than enough
for me, Miss Nazan.”

1251
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,080
And then we went to watch that concert
with Leman in the evening.

1252
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,960
It was such a showy concert.

1253
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,040
She calls me every bairam
and asks me how I am.

1254
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,080
She asks if I'm okay or
if I need anything.

1255
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,520
She is a loyal woman.

1256
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,760
Granddad, how come?

1257
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,360
This is all.

1258
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,320
I didn't know this story, either.

1259
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,000
I guess it never came up in our
conversation before.

1260
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,360
Granddad, so you have Nazan's
phone number, right?

1261
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,480
Could we call her if we wanted to?

1262
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,760
Is that okay?

1263
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,280
We'll talk if she calls herself.
It would be shameful otherwise.

1264
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,040
Then, when is the nearest bairam, dad?

1265
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,880
The way things are going,
every day is a bairam for us, Irem.

1266
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,080
Go on, wash your hands
if you're done.

1267
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,920
I promise you that we'll go to
her first concert together.

1268
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,840
-You promised.
-Okay, promise.

1269
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,280
-Bon appetit.
-Dad, what are you doing?

1270
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,920
-Give it to me, I'll take it.
-No, it won't stick to my hands, right?

1271
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,560
I'm going to make myself coffee, anyway.

1272
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,880
I'll do it.

1273
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,480
-How do you like it?
-It doesn't matter.

1274
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,000
I talked to Mr. Ilker today.

1275
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,480
About dinner.

1276
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,240
Okay. And?

1277
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,200
They're only available tomorrow evening.

1278
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,760
So?

1279
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,440
So they're coming tomorrow evening.

1280
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,400
Why didn't you tell me before?

1281
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,120
Before?

1282
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,880
I talked to the man an hour ago,
and I'm telling you now.

1283
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,080
By the way...

1284
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,120
...we won't talk about this Los Angeles
business at dinner tomorrow.

1285
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,240
I'll tell my father
in a more convenient time.

1286
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,800
Okay, we'll talk.

1287
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,920
Why are you waiting at the door?

1288
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,000
I thought I'd wash my hands.

1289
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,280
Irem is inside as you hear.

1290
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,920
Then let me wash my hands in the room.

1291
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,280
Shall we talk a little bit?

1292
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:58,200
Okay but judging from your intonation,
I can tell you are going to bother me.

1293
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,880
A girl to girl talk.

1294
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,720
I won't bother you, don't worry.

1295
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,400
But this conversation will stay
between the two of us.

1296
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,640
Promise?

1297
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,400
I promise.

1298
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,320
First of all, you don't really believe
the things your granddad told you, right?

1299
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,560
Why wouldn't I?

1300
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,440
He is an old man after all.

1301
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,920
His head is not clear sometimes.

1302
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,320
He's living in an imaginary world.

1303
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,400
Come on, Irem.

1304
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,320
My daughter can't be this naïve.

1305
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,560
Didn't you hear it?
When you said let's call her...

1306
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,560
...he said she called him
in bairams anyway.

1307
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,160
He didn't call her,
he slurred over it.

1308
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,640
Anyway, never mind these now.

1309
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,520
I'm going to ask you something else.

1310
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,040
What did your granddad tell you
in the bathroom last night?

1311
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,960
You two were...

1312
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,160
...he was holding your shoulders.

1313
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,280
He was consoling me
because I had a row with my father.

1314
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,200
Nothing else happened, right?

1315
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,560
Mom...

1316
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,320
...I'm getting something but...

1317
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,560
...tell me what you're saying clearly.

1318
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,280
The news you read,
the state the country is in...

1319
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,720
...made you paranoid.

1320
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,560
Not my granddad's head but
I think your head is not clear.

1321
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,120
Irem, how are you talking to me like that?

1322
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,840
How can you think of
such a disgusting thing?

1323
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,040
I hate you!

1324
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,520
Don't ever let my dad know about this.

1325
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,480
Irem, what did I say now?

1326
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:12,880
I hate you!
Get out!

1327
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,920
-Okay, I'm leaving.
-Get out or I'll scream.

1328
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,960
Okay, okay.

1329
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,960
You searched the recipe
for the Peking duck with orange.

1330
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,160
Are you looking at my search history?

1331
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,280
What's it got to do with it, my love?

1332
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,920
I didn't want to order in
when Mr. Ilker and his wife come here.

1333
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,320
I wanted to do everything myself.

1334
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,240
I wanted everyone to be astonished.
What's wrong with this?

1335
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,440
Ece, calm down.

1336
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,560
Your beauty is enough, love.

1337
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,520
So you're kindly telling me that
I am bad in kitchen.

1338
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,080
Ece, what are you talking about?

1339
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,280
If you want to have a row,
tell me frankly.

1340
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,560
I'm already dealing with a thousand
things, don't you start, as well.

1341
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,680
Am I starting it?

1342
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:57,120
You are the one who talks allusively.

1343
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,960
On the one hand my dad's trouble
and the job...

1344
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,880
...on the other hand, Irem's trouble,
and now you add yourself to the list...

1345
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,880
...to make it complete.

1346
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,120
Am I troubling you?

1347
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,880
I'm showing your father nothing
but respect.

1348
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:06,760
I've been doing everything on my own
for the past two days...

1349
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,560
...so that everyone can be happy.

1350
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,640
-What? On your own?
-Yes.

1351
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,400
It is me who is doing everything alone.

1352
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,840
Go to your room,
I'll bring you water.

1353
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,000
She'll pass by in anger now,
don't let her see you.

1354
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,600
How many people do I need to be?
How many of me do you need?

1355
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,600
Go to your room.

1356
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,000
If they can clone me, let's go
and have it done tomorrow.

1357
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,000
But no, even that wouldn't be enough,
right?

1358
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,920
You need an army of me.

1359
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,440
I'm staying here tonight.
Mrs. Ece asked me to.

1360
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,560
We were going to make a list
for shopping, for dinner.

1361
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,400
There's no need.
You can all eat me.

1362
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,600
Don't say so.

1363
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,240
It's too early.
I was going to sleep more.

1364
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,520
Don't whine about it.
It's a surprise, your granddad wanted you.

1365
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,360
There he is, go near him.

1366
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,520
What happened, granddad?

1367
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,280
Come here, squat with me.

1368
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,360
Look, this one is called Irem,
this one is called Uras.

1369
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,560
Are these flowers?

1370
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,800
No, cherry tomatoes.

1371
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,080
Remember the game you're playing?
This is the real thing now.

1372
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,680
We're going to plant them now.

1373
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,960
Take this spoon.

1374
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,480
Dig a pit here.

1375
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,080
Take this,
may your hand bring luck to it.

1376
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,520
Press there, bismillah.

1377
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,560
Granddad, you are great.

1378
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,520
But why didn't we plant it on the garden?

1379
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,040
No, digging up the garden and all.

1380
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,760
They would say something, never mind.

1381
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,160
This is your garden now.

1382
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,920
We're going to put it somewhere
that gets sunlight.

1383
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,280
Take Uras, too.

1384
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,400
Put it next to it.

1385
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,440
Press.

1386
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,280
They need sunlight.

1387
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,440
Let's give them their first water.

1388
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,680
Pour it down slowly now.

1389
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,960
I hope you take root like these,
you and your brother.

1390
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,440
I hope no one would make you
bend your head.

1391
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,400
Always stay green like this.

1392
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,320
My dear grandchildren.

1393
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,760
Do you want espresso, Mr. Kaan?

1394
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,640
I'll bring it,
you go to your father.

1395
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:08,920
Come on...

1396
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,400
...go and wash your hands directly
and then go to the breakfast.

1397
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,160
I'll tell you all about how to care
for them there.

1398
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,600
High five, bro, let it be known that
I am the owner of a farm.

1399
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,640
Wow. We'll see.

1400
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,840
Good morning.

1401
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:25,720
Good morning.

1402
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,840
-Dad...
-Well... I...

1403
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,560
...let me go back now.

1404
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,200
I'll go to the bus terminal
with a bus...

1405
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,440
Dad, what are you talking about?

1406
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,640
We've seen the doctor.

1407
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,680
They would've called us
if there'd been something.

1408
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:44,760
If there is something important, they can send
the file to the hospital in my hometown.

1409
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,200
They are doctors too.

1410
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:48,040
What did Ataturk say?

1411
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,320
He said “entrust me to Turkish medics!”

1412
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,680
He didn't say one of them,
He meant all of them.

1413
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,400
My son, I'm good,
don't think about me.

1414
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,360
Dad, stop for God's sake.

1415
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,360
Forgive me, please.

1416
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,560
About last night.

1417
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,800
I didn't want to say so.

1418
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,160
Well, you know...

1419
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,320
...it was a really bad moment and
I just stormed at Ece.

1420
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,640
I really care about you.

1421
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,800
You can't go anywhere,
I won't leave you.

1422
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,760
My son,
I'm not hungry or homeless.

1423
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,400
I am able-bodied, thank God.

1424
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,880
I'm only saying I'm going back to my
house, I'm not saying anything else.

1425
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,880
Dad, this is your house, too.

1426
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,360
Dad, look...

1427
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,480
...this is the first time I've seen
Irem happy in ages.

1428
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,120
And you are the reason for that.

1429
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,960
Please don't go.

1430
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,480
Don't leave us.

1431
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,520
Please stay with us.

1432
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,320
At least stay until these give tomatoes.

1433
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,680
Okay, dad?

1434
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,720
Go out, you need to do shopping.

1435
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,359
Don't wait, I'll clear the table.

1436
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,680
-You got the list, right?
-Yes.

1437
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,840
Okay, leave then.

1438
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,960
We have a guest for dinner this evening.

1439
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,760
Kaan's boss, Mr. Ilker, with his wife.

1440
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,920
It's a matter of Kaan's promotion.

1441
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,399
That's why it's going to be
an important evening for us.

1442
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,800
I'll be in the kitchen all day.

1443
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,080
I also arranged an assistant.
She'll come soon too.

1444
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,080
By the way, I let my mother know.

1445
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,000
They'll be with us too.

1446
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,720
So we're going to be a bit crowded.

1447
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,880
You won't mind it, right?

1448
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:48,439
You can go to your room
if you feel tired.

1449
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,439
No one would take it bad.

1450
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:54,000
My dad will do whatever he wants, Ece.

1451
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,920
Of course, dear,
that's what I said.

1452
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,279
Did I say something different?

1453
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,160
A good partner, a good housewife.

1454
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,920
Someone who can cook well etc.

1455
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,920
It's an old and outdated understanding.

1456
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,359
What are you saying?

1457
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,560
I'm saying that it is some women again
who deal a blow...

1458
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,520
...to the fight of the women
in this country.

1459
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,720
Let me summarize, granddad...

1460
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,760
...the assistant cook will be paid and
sent away before the guests arrive...

1461
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,520
...and plus, my mom is
embarrassed of you...

1462
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,640
...among these upstanding people.

1463
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,359
Apologize at once.

1464
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,080
Is that a thing to say to your mother?
What a shame!

1465
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,000
-Irem, apologize.
-I didn't do something to apologize for.

1466
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,000
-Sit down!
-The shuttle is waiting at the door.

1467
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,279
Please be a little bit more honest
from now on.

1468
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,479
By the way, don't worry,
I won't make a scene in the evening.

1469
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,840
I'll go to bed early,
like those well-behaved...

1470
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,200
...docile girls that are in your series.

1471
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,040
What's going on with this girl?

1472
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,279
I don't know.

1473
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:44,680
And I don't understand.

1474
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,120
Is she big, is she little?
What's this?

1475
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,560
I gave birth to a big hatred.

1476
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,600
Don't say so, my girl,
don't say so.

1477
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,120
Hatred is a big word.

1478
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,480
The human body is tiny.

1479
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,960
If you took that hatred in,
it wouldn't fit.

1480
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,600
If you carried it,
you'd crush under it.

1481
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,600
Don't say that.

1482
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,760
Fatos, I'll come with you too.

1483
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,560
It'd be nice for me to stroll around.

1484
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,320
Dad?

1485
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,760
Yes?

1486
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,240
Okay then, go on.

1487
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,400
It'd be a change for you too.

1488
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,880
Fatos...

1489
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,440
...buy a showy coffee for my dad.

1490
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,040
A showy one.
We'll drink it together.

1491
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,560
I can't meddle
with their domestic things.

1492
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,320
I can't say anything but,
you know, there is also a thing like this.

1493
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,640
Uras can't talk.

1494
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,160
They say it's because of high intelligence
but of course, he can't talk.

1495
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,800
Have you ever gone before him and
talked to him?

1496
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,640
And you expect him to talk.

1497
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,440
Mr. Kaan couldn't go to Irem's performance
because of his job.

1498
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,240
There was this English theatre thing at her
school. You know, they call it an event.

1499
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,120
Irem was going to sing too.

1500
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:46,880
And there was a dinner of the channel
that night...

1501
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,560
...it was an anniversary dinner.

1502
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,920
The celebrities, everyone was there.

1503
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,040
They both happened in the same night.

1504
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,920
When Mr. Kaan went to
the channel's thing...

1505
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,680
...all hell broke loose that night.

1506
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,760
Irem felt worthless.

1507
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,040
That's what she said.

1508
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,360
I can't say anything,
these are domestic matters.

1509
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,320
But if you ask them separately,
they are all right in their opinion.

1510
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,040
One of them wants her father with her.

1511
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,520
The other one has a job.
He is working day and night.

1512
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,880
It's hard.

1513
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,320
Yes, professor.

1514
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,680
He's not with me right now but...

1515
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,040
Face to face.

1516
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,800
I have two kids myself.

1517
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,000
God bless them, my girl.

1518
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,000
Thank you.

1519
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,120
One of them is called Zeliha.

1520
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,440
She's in high school.

1521
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,160
I want her to go to university.

1522
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,720
And Metin is my son.
So it goes.

1523
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,640
If there's work,
he goes with his father from time to time.

1524
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,120
Portage etc.

1525
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,960
But Zeliha will complete her education,
brother Esref.

1526
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,720
You should see her, she's so clever.
She's doing so well at school.

1527
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,680
One night, his father said let's marry her
she's a girl child after all...

1528
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:49,920
...and I got so angry.

1529
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,640
I punched the door,
It's wood got broken.

1530
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,920
He hasn't opened his mouth
since that day.

1531
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,200
What I say happens in my house.

1532
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,120
<i>Come, Kaan,
</i>Come near me.

1533
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,400
I'm going to explain the situation
to your father, as well but...

1534
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,200
...now that I caught you here.

1535
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,880
Just a minute.

1536
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,160
Why did we buy this, brother Esref?

1537
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,960
Because there was none in the house.

1538
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,240
They don't eat it.

1539
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,480
What's this?
Are we buying a car?

1540
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,560
It's always like this here.

1541
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,440
They don't eat it.

1542
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,600
What's this?

1543
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,640
A famous vegetable
where ‘m coming from.

1544
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,520
<i>The patient will have momentary loss of
memory and complaints...</i>

1545
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,840
<i>...such as not being able to find words...</i>

1546
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,560
<i>...because the bulk has been growing
in the temporal lobe.</i>

1547
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,360
<i>Maybe you have realized.</i>

1548
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,960
What your father has is glial tumor.

1549
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,680
It's the difficult kind.

1550
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,000
I am shocked too. I wouldn't
give it a chance if you asked me yesterday.

1551
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,280
Mr. Esref must have a very solid structure.

1552
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,200
Professor, now I...

1553
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,880
In this case?

1554
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,200
Operation.

1555
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,280
When?

1556
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,640
Right away, I'd say let's not lose time.

1557
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,360
I...

1558
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,400
...have to go abroad.
I have to.

1559
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,600
Isn't there anyone else who can
accompany him?

1560
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,720
There is, there is...

1561
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,520
Look at her hair.

1562
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:36,320
Is that good now? Like someone put
a watermelon on her head.

1563
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:51,200
Brother Esref?

1564
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,080
Brother?

1565
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,600
Kaan?

1566
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,120
Miss, have you seen an old man
in a blue shirt?

1567
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,080
We haven't.

1568
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,240
Brother Esref, where are you?

1569
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,960
My child, my child...

1570
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,080
-...look at me.
-Yes?

1571
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,200
Okay, calm down.

1572
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,040
I can help you out if you're lost.

1573
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,360
What are you saying, my child?

1574
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,960
I'm a grown-up man.
Why would I get lost?

1575
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,680
I lost my son.

1576
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,800
Kaan.

1577
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,480
He had his yellow shorts on.

1578
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,280
He had brown shoes.

1579
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,280
He's about 8 years old.

1580
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,600
Is that your grandchild?

1581
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,560
What grandchild are you talking about?
My son, Kaan.

1582
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,280
He had his yellow shorts on.

1583
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,160
And brown shoes.

1584
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,360
I sewed him those shorts
so that he can wear it in the bairam.

1585
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,160
His name is Kaan, he got lost.

1586
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,960
Give.

1587
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:08,120
I didn't die today,
I don't think I'll ever die.

1588
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,240
Oh, Fatos, the dogs should bite you!

1589
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,320
You should have been more careful, Fatos.

1590
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,400
What are you laughing at?
Did you see someone naked?

1591
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,520
We're losing our heads here and
she's having fun, laughing.

1592
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,880
Get up, brother Esref,
get up, let's go home.

1593
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,600
They're calling from the store.

1594
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,920
Are you going to pay for the things in the
trolley? Or should they put them back?

1595
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,960
Of course, we'll pay for them.
Are we thieves?

1596
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,880
Come, brother Esref, come

1597
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,040
Mr. Kaan...

1598
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,560
...they're asking to confirm...

1599
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,880
...you are saying okay to dinner
with Mr. Ilker and his wife, right?

1600
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,840
Okay, okay.

1601
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,080
Okay, I'm telling them.

1602
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,200
And we are ready.

1603
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,200
I gave the brief to the group,
they are reading it now.

1604
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,320
Okay.

1605
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,520
Where have you been, Fatos?

1606
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,440
I called you a hundred times.
Why don't you answer your phone?

1607
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,280
There was a mix-up.

1608
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,600
What kind of a mix-up?

1609
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,360
I forgot something from the list and...

1610
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,040
...we went back to buy it.

1611
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,280
I wish you forgot yourself too!
We won't be able to make it!

1612
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,720
It's all because of me.

1613
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,960
We'll help you,
we can do it altogether.

1614
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,120
There is no need,
the assistant is here.

1615
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,080
In the recipe it says to shower
it in hot water.

1616
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,680
That's how we'll do it, right?

1617
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,760
I think it should boil for 5 minutes.

1618
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,000
It's going to stay in boiled water for half an
hour and then we'll check if it's still hard.

1619
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,480
Move aside, my girl.

1620
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,120
Don't worry,
I'll take it out with that thing.

1621
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,400
-Dad, I wish you wouldn't bother.
-No, my girl, no.

1622
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,320
I think you're boiling water, take it.

1623
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,200
So that you wouldn't fight, right?

1624
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,560
Move aside for a minute.

1625
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,680
Look, we're going to cut them
in the middle.

1626
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,120
And after we boil it, we'll pour olive oil
and lemon juice over it.

1627
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,240
-Are we going to put garlic?
-No, it'd make it lose its flavour.

1628
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,160
Silence for a minute.

1629
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,080
Is my Uras pasha here?

1630
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,120
Welcome.

1631
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:08,320
I grated the fresh ginger,
It must be its flavour.

1632
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,640
Of course, the amount of honey and
orange juice is important, too.

1633
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,640
God bless your hands,
It's really good.

1634
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,720
Bon apetit.

1635
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,320
God bless your hands,
my beautiful daughter.

1636
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,440
I really love this vegetable.

1637
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,560
The ones I've eaten in the restaurant
didn't taste like anything...

1638
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,880
...but this is splendid.

1639
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,560
-Bon apetit.
-Bon apetit.

1640
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,560
God bless your hands, mom.

1641
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,560
Mrs., ask for this one's recipe.

1642
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,680
It would make a really good raki appetizer.

1643
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,680
But you're going to do it
exactly like this.

1644
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,480
But you don't drink raki.
Why on earth would you say that?

1645
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,440
I don't know, I felt like saying it.

1646
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,720
When I ate this...

1647
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,000
...I wanted to go somewhere by the sea.

1648
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,200
Actually,...

1649
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,720
...you should pack up your things...

1650
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,120
...leave your job...

1651
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:53,440
...and move to a coastal place somewhere
in the Aegean region.

1652
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,200
Here we go again...

1653
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,960
...his self that wants to run away
from the city.

1654
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,440
Is it a lie?

1655
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,560
Let's go.

1656
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,520
Is there something that's holding
you back here?

1657
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:06,760
This decision is taken
after the second glass of wine.

1658
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,520
After the third one...

1659
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,240
...he says we're definitely going.

1660
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,200
After the bottle is finished,
the suitcases are prepared.

1661
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:15,160
And when he wakes up in the morning...

1662
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,520
...he runs back to work...

1663
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,400
...like none of this was discussed.

1664
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,560
It is the only channel we watch.

1665
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:24,480
If you leave your job, who's going to
shape the media's future?

1666
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,560
Thank you.

1667
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,400
I think Mr. Esref lives there
somewhere, right?

1668
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,280
-Yes.
-I can tell.

1669
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,880
Praise be, you look young.

1670
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,400
Thank you so much.

1671
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,760
If you come that way, be my guest.

1672
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,520
I hope so, thank you.

1673
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,800
Kaan...

1674
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,600
...what a beautiful family you have!

1675
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,760
-You are very lucky.
-Thank you.

1676
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,640
Are you having a dig at us?

1677
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,840
Don't say that, my dear wife.

1678
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,520
Kaan, are we playing a game of silence?

1679
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,880
You say 10 sentences in a second
in the meetings...

1680
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,480
...and look at you now.

1681
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,560
My dear, if you were to shut up
a little bit...

1682
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,800
...maybe then he can talk a bit.

1683
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:02,920
Don't say that.

1684
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,680
Well, it's so joyous that...

1685
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,480
...I was swept up in listening.

1686
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:07,720
Mr. Esref...

1687
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,400
...how was Kaan when he was little?
Could you tell us?

1688
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,720
We have to know everything
about him, right?

1689
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,840
We're going to trust him
with a huge channel after all.

1690
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,080
It is for sure that he'll be
more successful than you, love.

1691
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,360
-Oh, you...
-There's nothing to be angry about here.

1692
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,040
Let the young ones take the lead.

1693
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,120
Yellow balls.

1694
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,160
Yellow balls.

1695
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,680
Did I hear that right?

1696
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,240
Praise be, you little thing.

1697
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,840
Bon apetit.

1698
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,800
God bless him.

1699
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,160
Aren't you going to sleep?

1700
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,160
I'll stay a bit more.

1701
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,520
What's this?

1702
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,320
You're celebrating the new words
your son learned?

1703
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,120
He said a proper word at least.

1704
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,280
Don't worry,
it wasn't embarrassing.

1705
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,440
Everyone except you laughed at it anyway.

1706
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,640
Is that so?

1707
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,160
I didn't find it funny.

1708
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,800
Go to bed for God's sake.

1709
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:28,680
I don't have the strength.

1710
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,440
-Okay.
-Okay.

1711
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,520
-Okay.
-Good night.

1712
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,120
-Fatos, has my dad gone to bed?
-Yes.

1713
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,440
Dad, are you asleep?

1714
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,880
No, son.

1715
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,680
Could you come to the living room
with me please?

1716
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:01,320
Okay, I'm coming.

1717
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:08,880
Dad...

1718
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,920
...shall we have a glass together?

1719
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,240
We've got melon and cheese too.

1720
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,840
In the tea glass,
exactly the way you like it.

1721
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,680
Son, at this hour?

1722
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,280
Is it late?

1723
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,360
Is it very late?

1724
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,760
To your health.

1725
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,400
What? The day after tomorrow?

1726
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,640
No, Esref, I'm coming.
Don't object.

1727
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,760
Leman, you asked and I told you.
Don't make me regret it.

1728
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,720
<i>They have enough trouble here...</i>

1729
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,800
...let's not have Kaan
deal with you, too.

1730
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,240
I didn't want to say that, of course.

1731
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,000
I really care about you.

1732
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,680
I'll go to bed, I'll wake up,
I'll go to bed, I'll wake up...

1733
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,680
...I'll get better and come.
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

1734
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,080
Are you going to be good?
Tell me the truth.

1735
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,520
Leman, when did I lie to you?

1736
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,160
<i>You're making me even more upset now.</i>

1737
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,880
Pull yourself together.

1738
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,320
I'm going to sew a dress for you.

1739
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,720
I didn't forget it, don't worry.

1740
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,960
Esref...

1741
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,880
...promise me.

1742
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,520
You are going to be okay
after the operation, right?

1743
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,080
Promise, really, I promise.

1744
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,560
I have your word.

1745
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,800
Or I'll be cross with you later on.

1746
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,160
Okay, we'll talk in the morning.
I'll call, it's late now.

1747
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,880
-Call me when you wake up.
-Okay.

1748
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,200
Okay.

1749
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,240
-She didn't wake up, right?
-No.

1750
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:02,520
Let her sleep, let her sleep.

1751
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,960
Oh, my beautiful girl.

1752
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,280
She tormented saying that...

1753
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,480
...she'll go to the hospital too
in the past two days.

1754
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,560
Of course, she'll be upset.
How can she not? You are a grandfather.

1755
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,440
I wish I hadn't been so stubborn and
had the operation back in Izmir.

1756
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,000
I gave trouble to everyone.

1757
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:20,200
What trouble are you talking about,
what are you saying?

1758
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,640
Of course, they'll get upset
when they have to get upset.

1759
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,280
If you live your life spoiled like that...

1760
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,040
...fate would slap you in the face in such a
way you wouldn't be able to get up again.

1761
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:31,600
Everything is for people.
The sorrow and the joy.

1762
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:32,640
They will learn.

1763
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,400
Okay, I got this.
We didn't forget anything, right?

1764
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,920
No, I put everything.

1765
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,920
-Dad, we can leave.
-The girl will wake up.

1766
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,400
Don't worry she doesn't wake up
at this hour.

1767
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,600
Come on, then, let's go,
get better and come back. Huh, dad?

1768
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,240
Of course, it'll be like that.

1769
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,880
Fatos, my girl, see you.

1770
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,320
I'll be there in the evening anyway.
I'll see you there.

1771
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,400
Dad, how did you find it?
It's good, right?

1772
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,520
-It sees the garden, as well.
-Thank you, son.

1773
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:17,080
Sir...

1774
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,240
-...welcome.
-Hello.

1775
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,600
Let's do the necessary examinations
first swiftly...

1776
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:24,320
...then, we can have all have a chat.

1777
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,320
Accepted?

1778
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,440
Yes.

1779
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,600
You'll be a guest here for tonight.

1780
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:32,080
It's classical here, we're going to check
your measurements etc.

1781
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,520
We'll have a nice hair cut
in the morning.

1782
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,040
And then, we'll make you better swiftly.

1783
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,560
-Granddad.
-Irem?

1784
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,360
My child.

1785
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,840
You forgot to water the tomatoes.

1786
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,440
But don't worry, I have.

1787
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,400
They'll be showy when they come out.

1788
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,080
Live long, girl.

1789
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,400
-Move aside, let me sit there too.
-Come, come.

1790
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,040
Don't worry.
Your granddad will be fine.

1791
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,160
Didn't you get angry because I came?

1792
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,320
No, I didn't.

1793
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,520
Surprising.

1794
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,240
-I'll leave you to school.
-Okay.

1795
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,240
Don't sulk now.

1796
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,600
There is nothing to be afraid of, son.

1797
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,160
Dad, I am not fine.

1798
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,440
What happened?

1799
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,600
There is no reason to go into
mourning now.

1800
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:45,000
We've come here,
here we are.

1801
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,600
Tomorrow will take care of itself.

1802
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,360
I don't know how to say it.

1803
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,440
I'm in such a place right now that...

1804
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,080
...it's as if...

1805
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,200
...I'm on a thin bridge.

1806
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:06,480
I am on the top of a vast,
thin wall.

1807
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,160
There are cliffs in both sides.

1808
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,320
But if I take a right step,
I'll fall down.

1809
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,320
Because the bridge itself is wrong.

1810
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,520
They made such a bridge that...

1811
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,320
...it's always full of others' faults...

1812
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,280
...full of cruelty and mercilessness.

1813
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,720
It's as if they laid each brick with sin.

1814
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,960
To stay on it,
you need to sell your soul to the devil.

1815
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,440
There is no other way.

1816
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,440
Because when you take a step
as a human...

1817
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,880
...someone that is coming behind you
will see that weakness...

1818
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:43,720
...and push you off that cliff.

1819
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,480
When I thought I won everything...

1820
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,160
...I realized that I lost it, dad.

1821
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,640
Son, are you out of your mind?
What did you lose?

1822
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,800
You've got your family, your wife,
your kids, your job. You are complete.

1823
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,200
I am proud of you.

1824
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,040
That's what I'm talking about.

1825
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,040
Do we have to pay this price, dad?

1826
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,640
I can't stop anymore.

1827
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,360
Not even for a second.

1828
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,600
The kids must always go to
good schools.

1829
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:10,960
We must have a very good house.

1830
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,520
We must never have anything missing.

1831
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,880
I must wear a different suit
in every event.

1832
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,960
Ece, as well.

1833
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,000
People want this from us...

1834
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,560
...and we give up on other things
for these.

1835
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,200
I always have to run,
I always have to run more.

1836
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,120
Because if I stop for a moment,...

1837
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,440
...I am afraid that the person coming
behind me will push me.

1838
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,760
Did you know?

1839
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,960
The chief editor we have now
will be fired next week...

1840
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,960
...because I'll take his place.

1841
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,360
And the man doesn't have a clue
about this.

1842
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,720
And I smile and say...

1843
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,560
...good morning to this man
every morning.

1844
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,280
What kind of a false pretence is this, dad?

1845
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:52,560
I am your son.

1846
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:56,200
It was you who taught me
how holy duty is.

1847
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,320
I know of the times that you didn't get
any sleep so that you can...

1848
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,000
...sew clothes for the neighbourhood
residents in bairam.

1849
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,640
I saw it, I was there.

1850
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,120
I saw everything from you, dad.

1851
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,440
I worked...

1852
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,480
...I went into everything wholeheartedly.

1853
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,280
I tried to make everything fit into
these hands, everything.

1854
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,160
But the past...

1855
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,680
...my past.

1856
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,640
I couldn't make it fit.

1857
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,800
So I took it out of my palms
and threw it away.

1858
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,720
The strange thing is
I don't remember when I did this.

1859
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,920
Or rather, was it me
who did this...

1860
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,760
...or did the others take it away
from my hand...

1861
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,680
...that's what I couldn't understand.

1862
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,920
Dad, I won't be able to be with you
during the operation tomorrow.

1863
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,760
I have to go to America tonight.

1864
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,120
Everything was planned beforehand.

1865
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,040
If I stay with you,
I will lose the trust of my boss.

1866
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:06,040
I know that everyone will act like
they give me right at first.

1867
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,760
In fact, they will praise me
for a couple of days.

1868
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,520
Saying see he didn't lose
his human side.

1869
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,440
See he turned down his job
and stayed with his father.

1870
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,720
But this is exactly the trap
they will set up, dad.

1871
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,720
Because they will shoot me from
my human side a couple of days later.

1872
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,800
Because someone else will take
my place...

1873
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,800
...and the power will be transferred
to them.

1874
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,040
Look, I'm climbing the stairs now...

1875
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:33,360
...but if I don't go, I will stop and I'll
start going down the stairs suddenly.

1876
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,680
Now, please tell me, dad.

1877
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,600
What would you do if you were me?

1878
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,480
You are right, son.

1879
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,400
I would do the same thing.

1880
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,040
No, you wouldn't.

1881
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,000
You wouldn't go.

1882
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,680
I'm going.

1883
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,560
I can't go.

1884
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,800
I am so desperate, dad.

1885
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,800
So desperate.

1886
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,720
You are going to drown
in the big sea, right?

1887
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,840
Fair enough.

1888
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,560
You are right.

1889
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,680
This is how it should be anyway.

1890
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,160
If you stay, you'll be unhappy
and I'll be the guilty one.

1891
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,080
Go and make a life for yourself, son.

1892
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,480
How can I say don't go?

1893
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,680
I am human,
I got a little selfish at first.

1894
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,320
It would be a sin for me to...

1895
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,320
...keep you right beside me.

1896
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,000
That would be selfish.

1897
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:47,280
If it doesn't work out, you can come back.
You can at least say that you've tried.

1898
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,640
This is for your good even
if you lose or win.

1899
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,440
This is the rule of life.

1900
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:57,480
Who survived this trouble called life
without getting dirty a little bit...

1901
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,320
...and getting wounded?

1902
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,640
This is life.

1903
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,040
It makes one get dirty.

1904
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,560
But I know you.

1905
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,960
In your core,
your heart is pure too.

1906
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,160
Go and make a life
for yourself there.

1907
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,040
-But shall I tell you something?
-Dad.

1908
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,440
What are you talking about?

1909
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,040
I'm going there for three days.

1910
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,840
I won't make a life for myself
there or anything.

1911
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,760
Oh, right.

1912
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,720
My head was gone and
I didn't know it.

1913
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,200
Hello, are you home?

1914
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,720
Both of you?

1915
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,720
Okay, I'm coming.

1916
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,920
We'll talk when I come.

1917
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,520
Son, I'm going to tell you something.

1918
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,040
If you're going to be this upset
about it...

1919
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,640
...we can wait for a bit more.

1920
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:56,880
You go and come back. And I'll go through
with the operation then.

1921
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,320
Dad, I thought about this.
Why wouldn't I?

1922
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,360
But the doctor...

1923
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,920
...the man doesn't have
any other available day.

1924
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,000
Only tomorrow.

1925
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:08,720
And dad...

1926
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,440
He wants you to get rid of it at once.

1927
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,400
I see, son.

1928
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:23,320
I understand.

1929
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:27,440
Ece, what's going on?

1930
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:28,720
You came in a hurry.

1931
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,920
You're not telling me
what this is about.

1932
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,080
-Why don't you sit down, my girl?
-I won't sit down.

1933
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,160
In fact, if it's possible,
I'll go away from this house at once.

1934
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:40,480
Stop, stop, stop.
What's that?

1935
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,120
Are you running away
because I've come?

1936
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,160
I was 9 years old
when you married this man.

1937
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,760
You remember that,
don't you, mom?

1938
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:48,320
Because I do remember it.

1939
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,160
Now I don't know if you remember
or if you chose to forget...

1940
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,520
...about it knowingly.

1941
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,720
I was 9 years old when this man
came to this house...

1942
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:59,840
...and screwed up my childhood...

1943
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:01,960
...and my youth!

1944
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,960
It all started with him spying out on me
in the bathroom.

1945
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:05,960
What the hell are you talking about!?

1946
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,080
Don't you ever talk!
Or I swear I'll kill you.

1947
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,840
-My girl...
-Don't call me my girl!

1948
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,680
And then Mrs.Servet...

1949
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,680
...he tried to touch me with his filthy
hands even when you were at home.

1950
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,840
-It's a lie!
-But he didn't do more than that.

1951
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,200
Do you know why?

1952
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,400
It's not like it's because
he made himself stop.

1953
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:21,840
It was because he was afraid.

1954
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:25,000
Because one day,
I stabbed him with a pocket knife.

1955
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:27,880
Of course,
you know about all these...

1956
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,280
...but do you know
why I'm telling you now?

1957
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,840
To shout at these walls the fact that...

1958
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,400
...everyone knows everything!

1959
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:35,640
Don't cast aspersions on me!

1960
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,560
You know she's never liked me
since she was a child.

1961
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,600
And now look at the things
she makes up!

1962
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,880
Shut up.

1963
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:42,880
Believe what you want to believe in!

1964
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,040
While you were living life without making
a sound because you were...

1965
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,720
...afraid you'd lose your husband, I,
your 9 years old daughter...

1966
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,280
...started to carry a pocket knife
in my pocket, mom.

1967
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,360
I never wore a skirt.

1968
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,080
While you were sleeping
in your room, farting,...

1969
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,120
...I was having ugly nightmares...

1970
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,560
...and I had a table and
chairs behind my locked door.

1971
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:07,760
When you weren't in the house,...

1972
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,720
...I waited under the rain,
under the eaves dripping wet...

1973
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,920
...so that I wouldn't be alone
in the house with him.

1974
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,240
How did you consent to this, mom?

1975
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,160
I was your daughter!

1976
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,120
How did you keep silent, mom?

1977
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,080
I forgot none of these.

1978
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,240
I've never stopped hurting.

1979
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,320
I doubted everyone, every man.

1980
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:35,480
I broke even the heart of that good
hearted-man, Mr. Esref, because of you.

1981
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,720
God damn you both!

1982
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,240
Rot away in this house!

1983
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,040
I hope you rot away!

1984
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,320
I won't come to your graves even
to spit on them.

1985
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:44,520
Know this.

1986
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,960
I've come, Fatos, I'm here.

1987
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,720
I had something important to do
so I dealt with it.

1988
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,560
You can leave for the hospital now,
come on.

1989
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,400
I was ready anyway.

1990
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,480
Uras.

1991
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,920
You have cash for the taxi, right?

1992
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,520
Yes.
Mr. Kaan gave me some earlier.

1993
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,320
Okay, may it be easy!

1994
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,640
Fatos.

1995
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,080
Actually, I could have gotten
a different assistant...

1996
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,840
...for a couple of days but...

1997
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,200
...you never know who someone is.

1998
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,320
I can't trust anyone but you.

1999
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,560
That's why I tired you out this much.

2000
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,880
Don't mention it.

2001
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:36,840
Thank you, Mrs. Ece.

2002
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,520
Thank you.

2003
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,040
<i>Kaan, could you give the phone to my dad?</i>

2004
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,760
Okay.

2005
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,160
Dad, it's Ece.

2006
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:27,720
Hello, yes, my girl.

2007
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,160
Daddy...

2008
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,600
...we couldn't talk properly...

2009
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,360
...when Irem raided the hospital.

2010
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:35,680
<i>Fatos is on her way,
she's coming.</i>

2011
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,800
<i>I have to stay with the kids.</i>

2012
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,320
But I'll come tomorrow,
taking Uras with me too

2013
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,040
Don't worry...

2014
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,520
...you will get better.
Okay?

2015
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:51,160
Okay, my pretty girl.
Don't worry about me.

2016
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,560
I am good.

2017
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,080
Be good.

2018
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,480
Stand over us...

2019
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,880
...like a mountain, okay?

2020
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,880
Promise?

2021
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:02,440
Promise.

2022
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,520
Okay.

2023
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,560
What's she saying?
What did you talk about?

2024
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,400
Not here... Granddad is not here.

2025
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:18,960
Granddad is not here.

2026
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:22,680
He'll come, he'll come.

2027
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,520
My girl, can you find me
some water, please?

2028
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,000
Hello.

2029
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,680
How are you?

2030
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:09,240
Good, good. As always.

2031
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,480
I'm going to tell you something
if you can excuse me.

2032
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,680
Well, I need your help.

2033
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,960
He's pretending to act like a macho
towards the girl without shame.

2034
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,840
Damn you...

2035
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:25,480
...it's the same old pack of lies
all the time.

2036
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:29,200
Brother Esref, we can watch something
you want to watch.

2037
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:32,280
Turn it off for a bit.

2038
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,920
I'm going to talk to you about something.

2039
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,840
Let me go out so that you can wear
your pyjamas and get comfortable.

2040
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:36,920
No, sit down.

2041
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,240
Listen to me.

2042
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,600
I'm going back to my hometown,
to my house.

2043
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,720
What!?

2044
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,280
Don't worry, my girl,
my head is clear.

2045
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,200
Kaan was scattered today.

2046
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,960
He was grieved.

2047
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,880
Because he wasn't going to be able to
stay with me.

2048
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,120
And there's this doctor over us.

2049
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,840
So?

2050
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,040
I'm going to ask them to send...

2051
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:03,200
...the document to the hospital in Izmir.

2052
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,000
I'm going to have the operation
there when Kaan comes back.

2053
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,120
Pretend like you were sleeping and
you weren't aware of anything.

2054
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:13,240
When you wake up in the morning,
you can tell Ece that I ran away.

2055
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:15,240
Brother Esref, it was better
if you just stabbed me in the heart.

2056
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,640
It's better if I die.

2057
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,760
My girl, we're talking about
Kaan's happiness here.

2058
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,480
I may end up not surviving
this operation after all.

2059
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,240
God forbid.

2060
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,680
Do you want the child to regret it
all his life?

2061
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,600
He would never forgive himself.

2062
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,080
Let him find me alive
when he comes back.

2063
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,000
The rest is down to him.

2064
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,080
My girl...

2065
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,560
...I can't torture my own child like this.

2066
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,920
Well, you're talking well but...

2067
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,080
...how can you go at this hour?

2068
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,160
The plane etc,
how is it going to be?

2069
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,640
Don't worry about that,
I arranged it.

2070
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,840
Of course, it's ready.

2071
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,000
Let me take a look at it
on the plane, please.

2072
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,400
Okay.

2073
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,520
See you.

2074
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:07,280
Kadir.

2075
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,000
Mr. Kaan...

2076
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:15,600
...I can bring something else
if you like.

2077
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,000
Have a safe journey.

2078
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,800
Hello, welcome.

2079
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:46,800
Mr. Kaan.

2080
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:50,160
Okay, I'm coming.

2081
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:55,240
<i>If Ece calls, you can tell her
that I'm sleeping.</i>

2082
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,040
The nurse has just been here,
she wouldn't come again for a while.

2083
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,680
I wish you wouldn't bother coming.
The car is waiting downstairs.

2084
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:02,840
No, I won't leave you without seeing
it with my own eyes first.

2085
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,840
If someone asks anything, we can say
we're going for a bit of fresh air etc.

2086
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,960
Brother, what's this?

2087
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,400
Don't worry about me, my girl.
I'm in safe hands.

2088
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:47,000
Am I going to be in the back again?

2089
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,680
Give your blessing, my girl.

2090
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,120
I give you my blessing, brother.
You give me your blessing too.

2091
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:59,680
I'm giving you my blessing.

2092
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,000
Okay, be well and I'm going to make
flaky pastry for you.

2093
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,200
We're going to eat it with ayran
until we explode.

2094
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:08,440
I hope so my girl, I hope so.

2095
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,360
Come on, child, thank you.

2096
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,680
<i>Son, I opened your bag this morning
secretly...</i>

2097
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,600
<i>...to put this, I'm sorry.</i>

2098
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,000
<i>But I may not be surviving
this operation so...</i>

2099
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,720
<i>I didn't want to leave this realm...</i>

2100
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,640
<i>...without telling you these
when my head is still clear.</i>

2101
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,480
<i>You told me that you'd carry
me on your shoulders.</i>

2102
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,000
<i>You have, son.
Don't get upset.</i>

2103
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,960
<i>I give you my blessing.</i>

2104
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,680
<i>Take good care of your kids
and your wife.</i>

2105
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,000
<i>Look after Irem more.</i>

2106
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,400
<i>Make sure that she eats...</i>

2107
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,880
<i>...and check on her with your eyes
after she's eaten.</i>

2108
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,000
<i>Kiss all of them for me one by one.</i>

2109
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,520
<i>I'm leaving the house in Foca to them.</i>

2110
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,480
<i>And I'm leaving the shop to Fatos.</i>

2111
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,320
<i>Let her sell it and
send her daughter to school.</i>

2112
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,360
<i>I'm writing this letter at night.</i>

2113
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,520
<i>I don't know what state I'll be in
after the operation in the morning.</i>

2114
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:20,200
<i>Well, you know...</i>

2115
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:22,600
<i>...it's not easy.
They'll get inside my head.</i>

2116
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,320
<i>You'll be with me
in the morning but...</i>

2117
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:29,440
<i>...maybe I won't be able to talk.</i>

2118
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,760
<i>Maybe I'll forget everything.</i>

2119
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,160
<i>Then, at that point...</i>

2120
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:36,600
...don't forget us.
Remember.

2121
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,800
You have a father here.

2122
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:44,000
All that we've been through is
so precious, son.

2123
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,800
Don't you ever forget.

2124
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,480
Remember us.

2125
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,040
Dudu...

2126
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,680
...my girl...

2127
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:16,560
...pray this morning.

2128
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:20,760
So that your father can get well
and come here.

2129
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:34,320
<i>29 missed calls</i>

2130
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:42,200
<i>Calling Leman...</i>

2131
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:52,760
-Hello, Leman...
<i>-Esref, where are you?</i>

2132
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:57,640
<i>-I've been trying to</i>--
-...shut up please.

2133
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,720
-I'm in the shop now.
<i>-What?</i>

2134
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,280
<i>Did you come here?</i>

2135
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:04,400
I've got a surprise for you.

2136
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,000
Come, if you want to see it.

2137
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,960
-Come on.
<i>-Okay, I'm coming.</i>

2138
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,040
<i>Is he crazy or what!</i>

2139
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,120
It looks really good, dad.

2140
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,000
It does, doesn't it?

2141
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:51,880
<i>My son</i>

2142
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,840
I am sorry for your loss.

2143
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:13,600
I'm sorry for your loss.

2144
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,360
Come on, everyone is leaving.

2145
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,160
Irem, what are you doing?

2146
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:41,160
I'm going to suffer a seizure
because of the heat.

2147
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:42,640
Mr. Esref.

2148
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:44,280
Stubborn goat.

2149
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,560
I'll be ashamed if I wear it...

2150
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,840
...you'll get upset if I don't wear it.

2151
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:56,440
You're kidding around with me
from there, right?

2152
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,120
I'm sorry for your loss.

2153
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,000
Mrs. Nazan, welcome.

2154
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,200
Welcome.

2155
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,560
I'm sorry for your loss, so sorry.

2156
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,920
Nazan, you came for my granddad.

2157
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,320
You are Irem.

2158
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,680
You know me.

2159
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,000
Your granddad mentioned you.

2160
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,000
Sing your song, sing.

2161
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:29,560
See what's just happened!?
Oh, God.

2162
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,080
<i>From the sound of the city</i>

2163
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:39,320
<i>From my darkest moments</i>

2164
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:45,200
<i>I came to you</i>

2165
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,040
<i>Am I late?</i>

2166
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:52,200
<i>Where are you, my showy one?</i>

2167
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:57,480
<i>When I was a child yesterday</i>

2168
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,800
<i>And when life was passing me by</i>

2169
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,840
<i>You stole my tears</i>

2170
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:10,600
<i>You are gone but don't forget me</i>

2171
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,840
<i>Don't be afraid, remember us</i>

2172
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,920
Take this, my pretty girl.
For your granddad's soul.

2173
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,440
<i>When I was a child yesterday</i>

2174
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:25,800
<i>While I was angry at wars</i>

2175
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,520
<i>You stole my tears</i>

2176
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:35,560
<i>You are gone but don't forget me</i>

2177
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:41,800
<i>Don't be afraid, remember us</i>

2178
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,160
Granddad, granddad.

2179
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:48,520
<i>Remember us</i>

2180
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:54,120
<i>Remember us</i>

2181
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,200
<i>Don't be afraid</i>
