1
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:09,799
As God created a man in his image...

2
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,640
I think that in the Bible

3
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:18,640
even the very first verse of Genesis says:

4
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:23,439
God created the heavens and the earth.

5
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,439
As I understand it,

6
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,280
Heaven is something ideal, spiritual,

7
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,040
Earth is something material.

8
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
And that's all, friends!

9
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,119
That is what we are doing
in documentary cinema!

10
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,199
We film the Earth, but we remember
that Heaven is above us.

11
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,839
We film the substance, the reality,

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,600
but always remember
there is spirituality too.

13
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,520
Where is my little tape recorder?

14
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,719
Too bad.

15
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,000
And now again...

16
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,239
Quite complicated.

17
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,839
If you want to get to angels,

18
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,479
you must struggle through
all kinds of stuff.

19
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,560
Never mind, soon I will...

20
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,919
Documentary filmmaker’s daily life.

21
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,839
Not bad at all.

22
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,160
Men go to the sea again,

23
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,000
women are waiting for them again.

24
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:42,479
Our main research object was man,

25
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:46,640
how he feels, who he is in general.

26
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,239
We studied them with all the resources
that were available to us.

27
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,520
We had a camera and time.

28
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,560
To look at or look closely into.

29
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,799
We had time,
we could look closely into it.

30
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,919
A shed must have been here.

31
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,199
There used to be a shed here,
this is the first shot.

32
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,799
Hold this folder for me, will you?
I start to look as a book-keeper.

33
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,479
Don’t lose anything.

34
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,959
It’s wide angle and a yard.

35
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,799
Anything could happen in the yard.

36
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,160
Thus we have a yard, because sheds
don’t express anything by themselves.

37
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,080
I’ll go and open that door,
then make a shot,

38
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:26,160
when the door is open,
and without me in the shot.

39
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,320
One panning sequence without me,
one panning sequence with me.

40
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,199
And perhaps a static shot with me.

41
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:37,320
Panning without me and simply
a static shot with me, and then...

42
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
So that it is possible
to edit stuff like that.

43
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,919
Destiny has decided otherwise.

44
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,759
Becomes a trick like in feature films.
Blimey!

45
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,799
There is nothing eternal,
only the changeability is eternal.

46
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,679
Before I made “Woman of Kihnu”,

47
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,719
there was also the world
that had already disappeared,

48
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,600
and before that another one.

49
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:43,239
This disappearing world,
in which we live now,

50
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:48,000
will be replaced with new variations,
worlds with new people,

51
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,080
with new beliefs. That’s how it is.

52
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,000
We have to tolerate it.

53
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,280
A film box.
This is a very good box,

54
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:46,640
it is good to stand on it,

55
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,000
when the sticks need to be
hammered into the ground.

56
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,479
Another very good feature of it is

57
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,600
that when my mother who lives in town
orders liquid dung for her roses,

58
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,399
then it does not leak,
it's very good to carry.

59
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,600
And the third feature is that
you can put the film there.

60
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:06,280
In some boxes, the film is also inside.
Some are empty.

61
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,479
Some of the boxes have to be left empty,

62
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,839
they have some unfulfilled
dreams inside.

63
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,280
In the afterworld, I’ll hunt elks too.

64
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:23,879
I’ll keep on living as I live now.

65
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,239
And I’ll go deer hunting.

66
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,839
I’ll live as I lived before.

67
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,199
Someone told me that over there
life goes backwards,

68
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,320
that man becomes bigger or smaller.

69
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,679
Smaller, smaller!

70
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,560
And afterwards when you’re tiny,
when you have shrunk,

71
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:47,439
when you get as tiny
as the smallest mouse,

72
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:51,399
then your life is over.

73
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,280
Show me how small the man will become.

74
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:57,119
How small will the man be, show me!

75
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,479
How can I show?

76
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:04,199
Like this tiny mouse.

77
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,640
Show me again!

78
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,160
- A small mouse.
- What size?

79
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,239
Here, like this.

80
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:16,879
Like this cone. Like a cone.

81
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:21,359
Tiny like this mouse.

82
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,320
- Will the man get as small as that?
- As small as that.

83
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,879
- And will the cone fall out of his hands?
- That’s it.

84
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,679
That will be the end of his life.

85
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:49,399
It is not possible to make films
for future generations

86
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,199
or for those who'll live
after 100 years from now.

87
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,359
We don’t know how they'll think,

88
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,040
We don’t know how fast they'll think,
or what they'll be interested in.

89
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:03,520
People have always created art
for their contemporaries,

90
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:11,040
talking about the thoughts
and feelings that haunt you,

91
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:15,160
that are important to you,
to your community,

92
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,160
to your people or the entire world.

93
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,199
I believe it's like that.

94
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:12,719
Just like there is no absolute
darkness or light,

95
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:16,119
there is no absolute documentary.

96
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
What the hell!

97
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,640
There are no times that will vanish.

98
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:48,359
This very moment will stay forever.

99
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,280
The time that has emerged
will never disappear,

100
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:54,640
Even though our senses
can’t grasp its permanence.

101
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,000
How are values born?

102
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:17,160
A man goes beyond the bounds
of old beliefs.

103
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:24,839
Sea and sand grow apples
when man wants it.

104
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,040
There was just sandy and empty land

105
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:34,320
and we can see an old man

106
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:39,239
pushing a trolley full of seaweed
along the beach.

107
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:44,239
He brought the seaweed here
and planted the trees.

108
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,479
It seemed so hopeless
and meaningless to us,

109
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,399
because no apple tree
would grow in the sand.

110
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,560
But behold, it still did!

111
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,919
Anyway, it was poetic, as there
was a man and nature and...

112
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:16,479
You are doing something that seems
pointless to any bystander.

113
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,640
Talk to me, boys!

114
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:11,119
What is it you are starting
all over again?

115
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:13,080
All over again?

116
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,000
Life. Always life.

117
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:19,080
All over again...

118
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:23,040
As we grow old,
we become infantile.

119
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,479
I'm returning to my childhood.

120
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:28,359
Back to this tiny...

121
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,560
The smaller I was,
the more fun I had.

122
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:36,119
This is all I earned during my life.

123
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,239
I don't even know what to start from.

124
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:02,280
I wanted to move it,
but look who's there.

125
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:16,280
It's been so many years now,
but this question –

126
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:19,919
why me, why not some other child?

127
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,560
This I don't understand up to this day.

128
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,759
Maybe it's my fate. I don't know.

129
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,119
Today is the 1st of September.

130
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,600
We are starting a new school year.

131
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,719
Four new pupils have arrived
at our school.

132
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,759
You will be called first graders.

133
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:44,799
This year, we will learn to write,
to draw, to read and to sing.

134
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,439
Or maybe you have already learned
it at home.

135
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,560
Kishkyte Vale.

136
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,560
Do you know how to read?
Do you know the letters?

137
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,919
- No.
- Fine, you will learn here.

138
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,280
Maybe you know a poem or a song?

139
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,359
A poem.

140
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,119
Do you know a poem?
Would you like to recite it to us?

141
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:20,080
Shameless bear, don't sit on the bike.

142
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,839
You've forgotten
how to tootle and to drive.

143
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,280
I watched the film

144
00:42:38,439 --> 00:42:41,160
when I was forty.

145
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:47,640
It was a birthday present
from my husband.

146
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:49,640
I cried a lot.

147
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,080
It touched my heart.

148
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:58,439
The film is so precious,
because everyone is still alive there.

149
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,719
My mum is still young and alive...

150
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,600
And all the neighbours.

151
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:36,520
The meaning of life is
searching for the meaning of it.

152
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:42,560
The very life, and the act of seeking
for its meaning.

153
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,520
And happy is that man,
who has the idée fixe,

154
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:49,359
that the meaning of life exists.

155
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,640
He seeks for it, makes mistakes,
finds it.

156
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:57,439
But it is like God - a myth.
No one knows what it is.

157
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,679
But the meaning exists.
Living without the meaning...

158
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,520
A person becomes degraded.

159
00:46:04,759 --> 00:46:07,479
Of course, drinking isn't
the meaning of life.

160
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,879
Drink this, and you'll live
for another 100 years.

161
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,399
- How much longer do you want to live?
- I don't want to.

162
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,239
You don't?

163
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,959
She doesn't want to. Why don't you?

164
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,839
I'm bored of it.

165
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,479
Old age. She no longer wants to live.

166
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,719
One needs to live

167
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,439
passionately

168
00:46:50,759 --> 00:46:53,199
and to make an effort

169
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,399
to live more or less honestly.

170
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,160
At least in personal matters.

171
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:02,000
And that's all.

172
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,719
The very best musician
is my son Pranas.

173
00:47:07,879 --> 00:47:10,000
He teaches in Vedarai.

174
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,839
He first learned to play the harmonica,
then he got himself an accordion.

175
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:20,160
So now he has assembled a band.

176
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,080
There are eight of them.
They tour the festivals.

177
00:47:32,919 --> 00:47:38,080
One thing - you mustn't be deaf
if you want to play.

178
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:42,759
Once I became deaf,
I could no longer hear...

179
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:52,479
I don't hear the...

180
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,359
The trebles are still fine,
but the basses...

181
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,600
They get mixed, and I can't play.

182
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,080
So I dropped it.

183
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,919
It has been five or more years
since I've touched it.

184
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,199
Now it's... You see, when not played,
music decays.

185
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:20,679
It won't...

186
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,359
Nothing good.

187
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:13,000
It's out of tune. It's decaying.
And my voice is getting weaker.

188
00:49:13,399 --> 00:49:19,040
So to speak, it is all dying.

189
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:23,520
Music cannot be motionless.

190
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,719
Now, we will all sing together.

191
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,239
Three, four...

192
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:24,839
I have not entirely fulfilled
my creative potential.

193
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,799
I am taking away with me a lot
of very good unaccomplished ideas

194
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,320
no one else will ever bring to life.

195
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:38,600
Maybe they will bring to life
the same ideas, and do it even better,

196
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:42,439
but they won't do it
with the same feeling,

197
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:49,359
and the individual approach to the film
as an artwork

198
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:51,520
that is specific to me.

199
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:54,119
I have felt it through.

200
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,919
I would now only need to accomplish it.

201
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:50,719
Time...

202
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:54,520
The flux of time...

203
00:52:55,479 --> 00:52:57,839
It changes a lot of things.

204
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:06,160
And what seems unshakable, majestic
and never-ceasing...

205
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:14,119
Appears to gradually change.

206
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,320
You couldn't even understand why.

207
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:31,879
Is there a meaning in filmmaking?

208
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:36,520
But what is it? Is there a meaning?

209
00:53:37,479 --> 00:53:41,479
Is there a meaning in building a house?
Or growing a tree?

210
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,839
Or raising children?

211
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,919
You can’t ever know.

212
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,359
When you are fully involved
in doing it...

213
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,320
It seems there is a meaning in it.
That it needs to be done.

214
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,719
The world falls asleep.

215
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,080
Men’s hands lie on wives’ shoulders

216
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:17,640
and on the launching buttons
of intercontinental missiles.

217
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,000
And in a house in Latvia,
in the middle of the forest

218
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,239
a man reads a newspaper

219
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,479
and thinks.

220
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,080
That is Imants, a trawler’s captain.

221
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,320
This summer he turned 29.

222
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:35,280
I was born two years before the last war.

223
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,080
I have two sons.

224
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,839
I smoke two packs of Prima per day.

225
01:01:02,879 --> 01:01:03,959
Agris!

226
01:01:07,439 --> 01:01:10,679
The door is open. Here he is!

227
01:01:11,479 --> 01:01:16,160
This is Agris, the one
who was in that film.

228
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:30,479
The little boys have gone grey.

229
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Grey – everyone goes grey.

230
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,239
Gray colour now is in fashion.

231
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,879
Through the holes of our nets

232
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,399
a rich world runs through,

233
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,199
the sea runs through, stars run through,

234
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:54,719
only fish remain.

235
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:00,080
Herring and only herring
are poured into our boxes.

236
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,199
Weren’t we supposed to catch
the silvery salmon?

237
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,799
We are two twin ships

238
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:17,959
bringing up catch from the depths.

239
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,560
Ships rope holds us together...

240
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:25,119
Where are you going?

241
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,600
Party is not over yet!

242
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,239
...for the sake of that salmon.

243
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,679
That will do.

244
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:48,479
That’s enough, I start getting ashamed.

245
01:05:50,439 --> 01:05:55,679
Let’s go home! It was good
when I came and stared.

246
01:05:55,959 --> 01:05:59,399
How much can you use of that –
a little shot.

247
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:06,919
Now he leaves with sombre music.

248
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:11,640
Aivis! Dinner is ready!

249
01:07:12,439 --> 01:07:14,520
Come, son, dinner is ready!

250
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,959
I have passed away once,
I have even been... dead,

251
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,359
but awake once again.
One time I had a ...

252
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,000
I had a beautiful dream.

253
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:35,919
In a huge hangar

254
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:41,479
there was placed some kind of obstacle

255
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,160
shaped like a loaf of bread.

256
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,000
Made of stone.

257
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,759
It was a bit bigger than this whole room.

258
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,759
And perfectly polished and clean.

259
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:02,439
And like a mountaineer
I had to climb on top of the loaf,

260
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:13,000
and there was only a small dent
where I could possibly put my foot

261
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,560
and climb up with my sports shoes.

262
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:23,439
I climb and climb and a girl
reaches out her hand to me

263
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,600
and helps me to climb up.

264
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,439
A pretty girl.

265
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,479
Well, it moved me so much
that I forgot...

266
01:08:57,919 --> 01:09:00,239
It was so beautiful!

267
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,959
Extremely beautiful.

268
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:08,000
The air up there...

269
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,160
Incomparable beauty, simply incredible.

270
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,239
In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth, and the earth was void

271
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:02,640
and the Spirit of God
was soaring above the water.

272
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:10,040
Somehow with these first feelings

273
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,640
of global perception of the world...

274
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:21,879
When at the age of five I was taken
to this melamed, to this teacher,

275
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,399
and we studied the first words
of the Bible

276
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:29,399
that in the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth,

277
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,679
and the earth was void and so on,

278
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,839
my perception of the world has changed
very little since then.

279
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,160
Afterwards I even thought that...

280
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,040
and in the film "Flashback"
I am talking about it too,

281
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,959
that I was somehow born sad,

282
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,320
with some feeling of grief
and I don’t know why.

283
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,239
It stayed with me during my entire life.

284
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:03,000
But my perception of the world
changed very little.

285
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,280
And this feeling of loneliness
in this world

286
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:09,560
I’ve had since my childhood.

287
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:12,600
I think that all the films
that I made since,

288
01:11:12,759 --> 01:11:15,320
they still are endowed with the warmth

289
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:21,239
of some sort of cosmic feelings
of human life.

290
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:39,000
We will all pass away,

291
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:42,959
and become like water spilt on the ground

292
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:45,959
that cannot be collected any more.

293
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,160
Perhaps not everything will be spilt,

294
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,679
maybe some dewdrops will remain.

295
01:12:58,799 --> 01:13:03,879
And this quiet sough of wind.
