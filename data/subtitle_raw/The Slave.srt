1
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,041
It is useless to follow them.
They can no longer be harmful.

2
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,208
- Egyptians can ride on a saddle.
- Right.

3
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:45,083
And it's convenient
when you must run away.

4
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,250
Randus! Look down there!

5
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:59,708
Egypt has been conquered.
Caesar has won.

6
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:03,458
- And you along with him, master.
- Let's go!

7
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,875
Let's go, or we'll miss
the evening meal.

8
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:51,458
It is not a lovely sight, but better
under the cross that on it.

9
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,458
I nailed many
during the war against Spartacus.

10
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:59,458
- I am still nauseous over it.
- Come on. The camp is far away.

11
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,708
Kill me, Roman.

12
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,333
Kill me.

13
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:14,500
Relieving their suffering is against
the edict of the consuls.

14
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,082
Why did you do it? It could
cost you your rank and freedom.

15
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,750
From the Rhine to the Nile,
everything is now Roman.

16
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:08,666
- Nostalgic over your land?
- The winners have no land, master.

17
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,500
I didn't liberate you
to hear you call me "master".

18
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:15,375
You are free, Beroz,
and you are our best explorer.

19
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,500
Show it. Explore in the kitchen
and find something to eat.

20
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:22,375
If there is food,
I will surely find it.

21
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,707
Cleopatra is using Rome
to take revenge.

22
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,750
So many of her friends
will end up in chains!

23
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:39,457
Many.

24
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:53,375
Randus, Caesar wants to see you
in his tent.

25
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:55,791
- Alright.
- What does Caesar want?

26
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,832
Only he knows.

27
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,583
We could leave Egypt
in the spring, Caesar.

28
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,583
Two legions are enough.
One will cover the delta of the Nile.

29
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:14,291
And our adversaries?
My enemies are in Rome.

30
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,207
If affection doesn't move them,
then fear must do so.

31
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,500
- They speak of me as a tyrant.
- Your voice will silence everyone.

32
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,707
Rome does not love Caesar.

33
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:30,125
Only those who fear a man
too great for their stature.

34
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,541
Randus.

35
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:36,250
Come closer.

36
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,125
- You earned your day.
- I carried out your orders.

37
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:43,666
You couldn't have done better.

38
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,582
He took command of the cavalry

39
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:52,041
and blocked the enemy on the plain
with a cohort. Excellent job.

40
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:55,957
- You're a centurion. You deserved it.
- Thank you, Caesar.

41
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,916
Are you still determined
on not commanding a cohort?

42
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:04,125
Being a solder of Caesar
is sufficient for me.

43
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,000
A commander's breastplate
weighs too much in the desert.

44
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:12,041
You're getting old. 20 years ago you'd
have carried a much greater weight.

45
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,208
The only thing I have in common
with Caesar is our age.

46
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:19,250
Besides, my best compensation
is participating in your victories.

47
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:22,416
But you surely don't want
to refuse silver pieces.

48
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,250
Here.
Drink to my health, fellow soldier.

49
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:29,457
And don't sing hostile songs to
Caesar with the legion's drunkards.

50
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:32,166
Come, Randus.

51
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,332
Once the Egypt campaign is over,
the struggle among factions

52
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,957
could arise again in Rome
and degenerate in a civil war.

53
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,375
- You know that?
- Yes, general.

54
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:56,916
- I want a risky service from you.
- Caesar says "Go", and I go.

55
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:01,708
Pompey's faction
cannot be harmful anymore,

56
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,291
but Crassus undisputedly dominates
in the provinces of the Orient.

57
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,375
His word still has importance
in the senate.

58
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:12,500
And the more I know about
his intentions, the better, Randus.

59
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:17,207
I think one head is worth more
than two in Rome.

60
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:22,207
One word about this at Crassus'
court, and you lose your head.

61
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,750
You must be my eye and my ear.

62
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,666
Leave at dawn with a couple of men.

63
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,665
Go to Crassus as my ambassador,
in friendship,

64
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,000
and try to find out
what is happening in Zeugma.

65
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,915
It will be done.

66
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,915
The Nile is congested
with the traffic of the troupes.

67
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
It's better to board in Alexandria.

68
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,790
It will be a long, difficult journey.

69
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,125
It will be hard for you to survive

70
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,665
if Crassus allies with Pharnaces,
king of the Parti, and he attacks me.

71
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:01,541
I want to know as much as possible,
what Crassus' intentions are.

72
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,541
You risk your life in this enterprise
and I, the loss of a friend.

73
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,208
- My life is yours, Caesar.
- If it is mine, preserve it.

74
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,625
Which Barbarian god
does this amulet belong to?

75
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,083
I don't know.
I've worn it since my birth.

76
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,875
I know Thrace very well
to be mistaken. It comes from there.

77
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,416
I saw an identical one
when I faced Spartacus on the field.

78
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,416
- Your memory is magnificent.
- One doesn't forget certain things.

79
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,915
He wanted to kill me with a blow on
the neck. His neck had a similar one.

80
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:39,333
- It didn't bring him good luck.
- He ended up on a cross.

81
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,833
And yet he was a good soldier.

82
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,833
You weren't born yet, centurion.
You don't know.

83
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,915
Spartacus knew few and simple
rules of war.

84
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:52,165
He had understood our strategy,
and he could've defeated Rome.

85
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,458
But the mass didn't follow him.

86
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,165
Farewell, Randus. Good luck.

87
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:05,166
And remember. Caesar's gratitude
is as firm as his memory.

88
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,583
Verulus, do you know
why the Sphynx smiles?

89
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,333
- Nobody knows, Caesar.
- Because nobody wants to understand.

90
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:23,041
The Sphynx smiles on men, Verulus.

91
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,125
Grains of sand
raised by the hand of destiny.

92
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,458
This way you'll learn, slave!
I'll rip away your skin with this whip!

93
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:03,166
- What is going on? Stop!
- She tried to escape.

94
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,791
Enough!

95
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,000
Randus!

96
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,375
Vetius! I wasn't expecting
to see you in Egypt.

97
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,291
I was. The echo of your gestures
has reached Rome.

98
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
- You've advanced in rank. Good.
- What is going on, Vetius?

99
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,625
The centurion avoided that
a slave be badly whipped.

100
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,125
She is Clodia, my sister,
travelling with me towards Zeugma.

101
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:28,000
- Hello, Clodia.
- Randus is, of course, enjoying

102
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,166
the favors of Caesar.

103
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,165
- Stop. What is your name?
- Saida.

104
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:38,583
Here. Pay the merchant and keep
the change. I'll buy this girl.

105
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,290
- You've nothing more to fear.
- And you won't have to

106
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,540
unsheathe your sword to defend her.
- Come on. Let's get on board.

107
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,000
- You, follow us.
- Lumone, who are they?

108
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,290
Vetius is a patrician who exploits
the fortunes of his sister

109
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,250
at the court of Crassus.

110
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,500
He is the best javelin thrower
that I know.

111
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,458
Once, in Gaul,
he broke the head of an Eburone

112
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:09,041
from a shore of the Seine to another.
It will be an interesting trip.

113
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:24,458
Magnificent hit! Civil life
didn't make your muscles rusty.

114
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,708
On the contrary, it allows me
to practice every day.

115
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,000
- You want to try?
- No.

116
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,458
A centurion cannot risk
his reputation.

117
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:40,540
And yours, in the eyes of Caesar,
must be very great,

118
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,875
both as a soldier
as well as a diplomat,

119
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,665
since he is sending you
on a mission to Crassus.

120
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,540
- Maybe.
- He will ruin my ship.

121
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,708
Patience. Crassus will buy you
a new one.

122
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,000
Give me something to drink.

123
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,583
In Zeugma you'll find slaves
that are prettier than this one.

124
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:09,666
But maybe you, as your general,
only want Egyptian women.

125
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:14,583
They say that Caesar is attracted
to Queen Cleopatra's fascination.

126
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:19,458
No woman can compete
with a patrician Roman woman,

127
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,750
not even Cleopatra.
- Will you stay in Zeugma long?

128
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:28,208
No. I will pay homage to the consul
and give him news of the general.

129
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,666
Crassus will be happy to receive them.

130
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:34,583
When Caesar took command
of the legions,

131
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,915
he would've wanted to be with him
as during the good times.

132
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,125
If the gold of Crassus
and the iron of Caesar

133
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,875
were united, they would
be two invincible forces.

134
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:48,875
But with gold we buy
the iron of the swords

135
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,708
and Caesar is too shrewd
to forget that.

136
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,665
Everything has a price,
even your javelins.

137
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:58,125
- What do you mean?
- What I said.

138
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,875
- I didn't want to offend you.
- Forget it. Vetius understood.

139
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:06,625
It's best to be on the side of
the strongest. It's more useful.

140
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,666
The wisdom of Minerva
from the lips of Venus.

141
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,625
How long will the journey last?

142
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:19,166
If we don't run into fog, we'll
be at the port tomorrow at dawn.

143
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,250
That is, if the mainmast
doesn't break.

144
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,833
Darn! They went inside the wood
by a span.

145
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,040
It will take the strength
of Hercules to pull them out.

146
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,333
Gods of the Olympus, help me
pull out these spears

147
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,250
without ruining the mast
- Let's not disturb the gods.

148
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,083
Beroz, your sword.

149
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,083
Magnificent, Randus!

150
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's throw them in the sea.

151
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,208
- What is happening?
- The old man is dead.

152
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,125
He rebelled when we took him away.

153
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:09,333
- He's still alive!
- Not for long. It's a mortal wound.

154
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,375
- I detest the sight of blood.
- Go! Go!

155
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,500
Hurry. Toss them in the sea
and clean the deck immediately.

156
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,458
Hurry, go on! Down!

157
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,166
Your tunic is soiled with blood.

158
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,000
How horrible!

159
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:50,290
Depth, 3 arms.

160
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,540
Rocky bottom.

161
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:01,416
Nothing in sight!

162
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,541
Depth, 4 arms.

163
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,541
- Do you see anything on that side?
- Nothing.

164
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,541
Keep your eyes well open.
Depth, 6 arms.

165
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,166
How foggy! I've been navigating for
20 years and never saw such fog.

166
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:24,458
Styx, where the dead are ferried,
can't be worse.

167
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,666
Don't you feel
like you're in your country, Beroz?

168
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,875
The fog of my forests is different.
I don't like this one.

169
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,915
I don't either.
Zeugma's coast is full of rocks.

170
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,583
We could end up in water
without realizing it.

171
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,250
Be careful. I must return to Rome
but not riding on a shark.

172
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,000
It's better than that nag of yours.

173
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,915
Depth, 6 arms.

174
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,041
The current is increasing.

175
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:17,083
I saw you at the camp
on the plain of the pyramids.

176
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,250
I am beginning to think
you don't have a voice.

177
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,165
I only heard you speak once.

178
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,666
At the port, remember?
When you said your name.

179
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,291
How does the noble Clodia treat you?

180
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:44,000
As a Roman woman treats a slave.

181
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,708
- As a slave.
- Not all Roman women are like her.

182
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:52,250
There are better ones
and worse ones.

183
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,875
You could've had a worse one.
Believe me.

184
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,250
Nothing matters anymore.

185
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,875
My home was destroyed
by your soldiers.

186
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:11,625
My father, my mother...
Their throats were slit like lambs.

187
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:17,083
They were only guilty of defending
the land where they were born.

188
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:23,333
You would never ask an object,
a lifeless thing,

189
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:29,458
if it is happy or not. So why
do you ask me how I am treated?

190
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,750
I am a soldier, not a torturer.

191
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,208
Anyway, I cannot change
the state of things.

192
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,750
There are masters and servants,
just as pretty and ugly women,

193
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,000
wise and stupid men.

194
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,041
The master finds this to be right,
not the slave.

195
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,083
Depth, less than 3 arms.
Visibility, almost none, Captain.

196
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,916
There, Captain!
We're about to collide!

197
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,000
Help!

198
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,958
Help me.

199
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,958
Look! The ship is moving away!

200
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,166
Saida...

201
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,291
Thanks to the gods, we are safe.

202
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,666
- You risked your life to save me.
- I had to. Can you walk?

203
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,625
- Yes.
- Let's leave, or it will be too hot.

204
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,416
Come on.

205
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,791
- What has happened to the others?
- When the fog cleared,

206
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
maybe they found safety.

207
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,666
How will we cross
the desert without food or water?

208
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,666
If we are fortunate,
we will encounter a caravan.

209
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,916
Come.

210
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,833
Look up there!

211
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,250
Come on! Keep moving!

212
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,208
Come on! Keep moving!

213
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,041
Walk!

214
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:47,458
They are Lycian warriors, the most
ruthless predators of the desert.

215
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:52,125
Even Lycia is subject to Crassus.
Don't be afraid.

216
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,875
Go get them!

217
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,000
- Enchain him!
- Let me go!

218
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,166
Let me go, filthy savages!

219
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:18,208
Have them free me or you'll pay with
your head. I'm a Roman centurion.

220
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:21,416
- I am going on a mission to Crassus.
- Be quiet, you beast!

221
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:27,083
As big as you are, you could
be worth 8 gold pieces

222
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,958
and live a few years
dragging your chains.

223
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,875
But be careful.
One word from Murdock.

224
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:38,000
and you'll be ripped apart like
a carcass in the desert sand.

225
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,791
And this, in the name of Crassus.

226
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,125
Tie him! Put him with the others!

227
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:51,166
- Go on!
- Idiot. You want us all killed?

228
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,500
Get moving!

229
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:02,166
Whip them if they don't move!
Walk!

230
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,541
Go on!

231
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:27,375
Go on! Move!

232
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:48,583
Have them drink,
and then keep walking!

233
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,750
Water! Water!

234
00:25:06,958 --> 00:25:08,791
Me!

235
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,208
Me!

236
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,250
Let go!

237
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:21,750
Save your breath
and learn the first rule.

238
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:26,083
If the whip of the Lycians scars
your skin, Gular can take it away.

239
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:30,958
Gular, we must not fight
among ourselves.

240
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,041
He has our same destiny.

241
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:54,625
- Stop! Split up!
- Scums!

242
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,708
Go!

243
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,375
To your places, animals,
or I'll kill you!

244
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,875
What is that?

245
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:15,791
Where you'll will end up,
this will be useless to you.

246
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,041
But it will give me at least
6 mugs of cider

247
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,208
that I'll drink one after the other
to the health of Caesar's ambassador.

248
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,125
Move!

249
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,708
They've rested enough!

250
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:33,208
- Have them get going! Go on!
- Go on! Keep walking!

251
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,125
Forgive me, foreigner.

252
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:46,458
Please forgive this madman, Gular.
I had lost my head.

253
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:51,708
Gular was a great gladiator. He hates
everyone, sees enemies everywhere.

254
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:06,250
From now on, I will obey you,
because I know who you are.

255
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:11,125
That amulet revealed it to me.
I saw it on a newborn boy.

256
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:15,041
His mother was Varinia
and was the wife of Spartacus.

257
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,083
The baby almost suffocated
under the weight of that slab.

258
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,916
I am a Roman, not a slave.

259
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:24,541
- Yet that is so.
- Shut up, wretches!

260
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,041
Come on, Baxus.
A bit longer, and we'll be free.

261
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:16,541
Why do you want to go to Zeugma?
Beyond the rocks, in the Lubar ruins,

262
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,208
the City of the Sun roads open,
and others are waiting for you.

263
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,083
I will lead you
to your father's tomb.

264
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:28,250
What are you saying?
You must be mad.

265
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,125
Don't pretend. I know your name.

266
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,666
I've been waiting 20 years to
shout it on the day of the struggle.

267
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:39,500
You will carry out what your father
began, as was promised, Randus.

268
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,375
Ssshh! Someone is coming.

269
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,666
- Where is the girl?
- She is here.

270
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:59,416
- Let her go!
- Let me go!

271
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,750
- Let me go!
- My little dove!

272
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,958
Let me go!

273
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,666
Don't move.

274
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:28,000
If the gods assist us,
no one will whip your skin again.

275
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:09,291
I told you I was a Roman centurion,
and I will show you!

276
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Come, friends!

277
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:53,583
The man who came from the sea
liberated us! He is our leader!

278
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:56,166
This is your amulet.

279
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,500
Food and water for everyone
and get ready to march!

280
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:07,125
Beyond Lubar, is the City of the Sun,
where there's freedom!

281
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:11,291
Don't reason as a madman. If you know
the road to Zeugma, indicate it.

282
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:21,250
Finally! I see that you managed
to fight even in the desert.

283
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:27,000
Neptune spared your life, and spared
my boredom in weeping over you.

284
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:30,875
- I thought you were dead.
- Nobody will see Gular in chains now.

285
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:35,333
Your people are waiting for you.
Listen to the voice of your blood.

286
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:03,958
You were fortunate not to find
sharks and moray eels.

287
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,625
When they find meat,
they only leave the skeleton.

288
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:19,791
So you had to use your sword
to conquer your freedom again.

289
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:23,791
The name of Caesar, noble Crassus,
wasn't enough for your warriors.

290
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,458
My Lycians don't differentiate,
but they are faithful auxiliaries.

291
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,083
I am sorry for what happened.

292
00:32:34,291 --> 00:32:37,291
But the name of Caesar
opens every door

293
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,666
in Zeugma and wherever
my power reaches.

294
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,625
Saving yourself so fortunately
from the waves

295
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,958
to then suffer the whip and chains
like a slave

296
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,916
must have been
a very exciting experience.

297
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,666
Not as much as that
of Zarok's men.

298
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:59,541
You see? One Roman was enough
to wipe away

299
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,166
your best warriors.

300
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,875
You looked like
the god of war, Randus.

301
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,541
It's a matter of killing
or being killed.

302
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,416
You are right.
Killing to avoid being killed

303
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:15,000
is the elementary law
of war and of politics.

304
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:18,708
But who held the weapons
and was involved

305
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:22,916
in that unfortunate incident
must not live.

306
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,000
That group of slaves
must be put to death.

307
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,375
Zarok will personally deal with it.
They won't see tomorrow's dawn.

308
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,125
But not Saida. She is my slave.

309
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,083
I paid for her,
and do not want to give her up,

310
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:40,208
since, thanks to Randus,
she was saved.

311
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,875
I will spare her, but not the others.

312
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,041
They participated in a rebellion.

313
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,166
They witnessed an act

314
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:51,708
that offended my prestige
and my authority.

315
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:57,875
- You do this because they helped me?
- Yes, they helped the rebel,

316
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:00,791
not the Roman.
- Please, enough

317
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,625
of this melancholy reasoning,
and let's take care of the guest.

318
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:10,291
Crassus' renowned magnificence
must shine in his palace.

319
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,083
Clodia is right. We will make
your stay in Zeugma pleasant.

320
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,625
We'll also talk about the new
situation Caesar created in Egypt.

321
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:24,666
We are neighboring, as were
our villas on the Tiber.

322
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:28,625
Lumone, I entrust the guest to you.
You know the palace's customs.

323
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,000
- Let's go, Clodia.
- Come, Randus.

324
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:40,291
What are you waiting for, Zarok?
Carry out Crassus' order.

325
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,291
You know the legend of King Midas?
Crassus overtakes him.

326
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,625
He can't transform into gold
all that he touches

327
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:54,666
but knows how to squeeze it
wherever it is, without any qualms.

328
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:59,000
He sells as slaves
the inhabitants of whole villages.

329
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:03,791
Not even Caesar imagines how
powerful and dangerous Crassus is.

330
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,833
I saw a lot of gold
brought within these walls.

331
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:14,791
- What else did you see?
- Fortifications along the river,

332
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,416
blacksmiths making ballistae.
Who does he want to attack?

333
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:24,458
He tripled the number of guards and
all the princes are subject to him.

334
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,750
He sends armies and gold to Pharnaces,
fills coffers with precious stones.

335
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:32,791
- What does he give Rome's treasury?
- Nothing.

336
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:40,000
Crassus is the law and force here,
and has secret ambitions.

337
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,875
We'll try to find out more
by asking the servants.

338
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:48,791
No, they won't talk. They know
that betrayal would cost their lives.

339
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,083
You must be very careful.

340
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,708
One false move, and you are lost.

341
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:15,750
It doesn't take much here to end up
on the cross, water up to your neck.

342
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:19,083
When the tide comes,
they'll all drown as mice.

343
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:23,833
Their cries will sound out
in the entire palace. It's horrible.

344
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:27,583
Either Crassus is a heavy sleeper,
or he likes that concert.

345
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:31,583
When I was in the desert,
I heard about a strange place.

346
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:35,625
- The City of the Sun.
- Fantasies.

347
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:40,875
All the slaves talk about a city
where those who escaped the chains

348
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:45,000
find shelter,
but I am sure that it doesn't exist.

349
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:50,333
We must verify that. If it exists,
its inhabitants could help us.

350
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,916
To serve Caesar
any means could be useful.

351
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:52,666
It must be here. Among these
ruins there is the City of the Sun.

352
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,083
What is the use of all this, master?

353
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:58,750
To find out the truth.

354
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,708
Here. What is written, comes true.

355
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:46,166
The sword of Spartacus
is in the hands of his son.

356
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,125
I, Gular the gladiator,

357
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:57,083
was at Spartacus' side
in battle for 9 moons.

358
00:40:57,291 --> 00:41:02,000
You all know me, and know
that I have never deceived you.

359
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:07,541
Whoever has seen death close up,
as I did, doesn't lie.

360
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:14,041
I am the only one, among over 6,000
who saved myself from the cross.

361
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,791
The great Spartacus,
who rests under the black stone,

362
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,958
placed this sign
around Randus' neck.

363
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,708
He was born from Varinia
before the last clash.

364
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:28,416
You are the man we were waiting for,
the leader of the slaves,

365
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,166
our hope, our revenge.

366
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:34,583
- Are you sure of what you're saying?
- I have no doubts.

367
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:38,500
You can do anything.
You have our lives in your hands.

368
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:43,291
You can sell us to Crassus, he who
crucified your father, or lead us.

369
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,375
The choice is yours.

370
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:47,916
Listen to your blood and decide.

371
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:53,000
You can deny the truth
and destroy our last hope,

372
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,625
but just say one word, freedom,

373
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,708
and to the sound of that word,
even the dead will rise.

374
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,125
Leave me alone.

375
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,083
Murderer.

376
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,583
You are a murderer, Crassus.

377
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,541
One day you will pay
for all your crimes.

378
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,458
We too, one day will be revenged!

379
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:19,541
Listen to how they shout.
They're like skinned pigs.

380
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,000
- Scums!
- Murderers!

381
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,875
Scums!

382
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,208
To arms! Hurry, run!

383
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,166
- Help!
- Help!

384
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:21,083
- Out!
- Damn them!

385
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:25,208
- Help!
- Help us!

386
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,750
Murderers! Now it is your turn!

387
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:38,416
Hurry. Untie me and I'll help you.
I know who you are.

388
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:40,750
You are the son of Spartacus!

389
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,791
Tie them to the poles!

390
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,500
Now it's your turn, coward!
It's how you'll all end up!

391
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:08,791
Hurry! Beyond the river!

392
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,583
Find safety in the City of the Sun!

393
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:15,208
There's no time to lose! Go!

394
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,125
- Hurry, let's go!
- Help!

395
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,083
Help!

396
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:24,708
Help!

397
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
What is happening here? Guards!

398
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,791
- Clodia, what are you doing here?
- Give the alarm!

399
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,541
Round up the guards!

400
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,750
They are obliging me
to leave my rooms.

401
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:42,583
- Vetius, what is happening?
- I'll go see.

402
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,750
The shouts came from
the slave area.

403
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,708
- Where are the palace guards?
- What is going on?

404
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,875
They activated the dam, liberated the
prisoners and killed the guards.

405
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:56,958
Another two of my men
died on the poles.

406
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:08,458
Look. They left this mark
on the door!

407
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,958
Work, slave!

408
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,791
- Here he is!
- That's enough! Let's retreat!

409
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,250
- Go! Let's retreat!
- This way!

410
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:59,291
Spartacus has struck again.
Soon we will be free.

411
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:05,916
The province is in an uproar.
The people are resisting.

412
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,750
They don't want to pay taxes.

413
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:14,000
There were some dead, and
Crassus decided to be more severe.

414
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,166
Nothing serious, I hope.

415
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,250
It would be annoying if we should
talk about war again.

416
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:24,833
There is no war in the Olympus.
No one can threaten your peace.

417
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:44,291
Everyone come to the ground!
Hurry!

418
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,708
We exterminated them! Victory!

419
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:22,000
For over a month that cursed man
has been stirring up the population.

420
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,250
Crassus is worried about it.

421
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:28,291
Caesar could take advantage
to come here with his legions.

422
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,750
- You don't want that, either.
- What does that mean?

423
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:35,916
Caesar's coming would damage you.
You are Crassus' right hand man.

424
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:39,416
- You'll inherit the province.
- Is it a sin to be ambitious?

425
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,291
Who isn't, after all?

426
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,958
In serving Crassus,
I serve the Republic.

427
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:51,208
And if they should give me a tribune
toga, I'd know how to behave.

428
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,250
But you...

429
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:58,208
For however glorious he may be,
Caesar is a mortal being.

430
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:01,250
You could begin
thinking about yourself.

431
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:03,833
Yes.

432
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:09,083
If you want, my sister can
intercede for you. She likes you.

433
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:14,958
Crassus isn't eternal either. One day
we could divide our assignments.

434
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:20,000
I, the government,
and you, commander of the army.

435
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:23,958
It's the same old story
of iron and gold.

436
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:28,041
But it is not a bad idea.
I'll think about it.

437
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,875
- Of course I will think about it.
- Good.

438
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:56,000
This must be the area.
Let's form a second column.

439
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:59,041
- You want to take command?
- No. I will stay here with you.

440
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,625
I'm not familiar with the desert,
and the Lycians and I don't get along.

441
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,250
Right, Zarok?

442
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:11,083
You'll come with me. Your experience
will serve to capture the rebel.

443
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,291
Take half the men
and search the rocky area.

444
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,666
- We will meet at the oasis of Abal.
- I'm going.

445
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:21,583
Move forward! To the right!

446
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,333
Here. This is the place
where that cursed man appears.

447
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:56,458
- Are you sure?
- Yes. The information was exact.

448
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:58,166
Up there! Look!

449
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:05,000
It's him! Damn him!
We must capture him, dead or alive!

450
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:08,041
- I'll block him from behind.
- Alright.

451
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,333
Forward! Gallop!

452
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,958
Very good, Beroz!

453
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:56,583
Move forward!

454
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,500
There he is down there.

455
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,041
- He can't escape us. Come!
- Gallop!

456
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:36,125
Forward! He's ours!

457
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,500
They are trapped.

458
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:10,625
Damn it!
We've fallen into a trap!

459
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,500
Push!

460
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:21,000
To the ground!
Find shelter under the rocks!

461
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:30,875
Go on! Get off your horses!
Find shelter! Spread out!

462
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,666
To the ground!
Form a circle with the horses!

463
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:07,500
- Randus! We defeated them!
- Now disappear.

464
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:11,541
- They must find no one.
- Behind the rocks! Let's spread out!

465
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,750
Behind the rocks!

466
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:22,916
Hurry, master.
Vetius is waiting for you.

467
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:27,166
Come join us soon,
son of Spartacus. We are waiting!

468
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:29,791
Go! Spread out!

469
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:45,291
By all the gods, what happened?

470
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:50,125
That bastard tricked us again.

471
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,000
An avalanche of rocks fell

472
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:59,916
and crushed men and horses.
A massacre.

473
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:04,208
The mysterious gladiator was all
around. Impossible to capture him.

474
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:08,791
Impossible doesn't exist.
Just a few slaves don't frighten me.

475
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,416
I have tamed much more.
The rebellion in the Laurius mines,

476
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:18,000
the revolt in Spain, the rebels of
Spartacus, all under the cross!

477
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,791
Erased from the face of the Earth!

478
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,625
Are you sure, Crassus?

479
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:29,666
Are you sure the man you defeated
20 years ago isn't here again?

480
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:33,875
- You know who I mean. Spartacus.
- You are delirious!

481
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:36,416
Spartacus died on the cross!

482
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,000
- His body was never found.
- The crows ate him.

483
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:42,458
I saw some soldiers fall.

484
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:47,291
On their bodies they had
a mark like this one.

485
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:51,958
They say it's the mark of Spartacus.

486
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,958
Absurd! It's absurd!

487
00:55:57,416 --> 00:56:02,166
This rebellion must be tamed, at the
cost of a province full of crosses.

488
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:05,375
And peace will return to Asia.
You have Crassus' word!

489
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:10,666
- You will help me, Randus.
- There is no glory

490
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:15,583
in fighting slaves,
but it is not up to me to judge.

491
00:56:15,791 --> 00:56:18,291
I will serve you
for the glory of Rome.

492
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:22,625
For the glory of Rome,
many things are done.

493
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,375
Also destroying the Triumvirate,
as Caesar did.

494
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:30,000
Or destroying the Republic,
as he is trying to do!

495
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:34,416
If you serve me with loyalty,
you'll have no complaints.

496
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:39,583
They say I am a Croesus.
I am the richest man in Rome.

497
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:43,541
I can be generous
with who is faithful to me,

498
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:48,750
and ruthless with who is my enemy.
Have the prisoner enter.

499
00:56:57,708 --> 00:57:02,916
The moray eels are hungry. They can
satisfy their hunger in abundance.

500
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:08,208
He's from Oboz. In his home
he had spear tips and Roman arms.

501
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,000
It seems he is in contact
with the rebels.

502
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,083
Your destiny has been marked.

503
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:17,208
You can save yourself only by
telling me where your companions

504
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:19,416
and your leader is.

505
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:25,041
Speak! Who is your leader?
Where is he hiding?

506
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:29,208
Answer! Speak, you scum!

507
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,875
Speak!

508
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:39,000
The son of Spartacus is everywhere.

509
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:43,833
His mark will lead us to victory
and you, to death!

510
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:48,250
- Murderer!
- Toss him to the moray eels!

511
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:53,250
- He dared defy me!
- Murderer!

512
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:14,583
March to the village of Oboz with
the best men. Raze it to the ground.

513
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,000
Massacre all the inhabitants!

514
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:20,666
Don't leave one person alive!

515
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:27,375
Maybe he is right in using
these methods, but they disgust me.

516
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:35,250
Of course. He's in trouble.
The rebels are digging his grave.

517
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:37,458
I wouldn't want to be in his place.

518
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:40,875
Not even with his gold.

519
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:48,041
Randus, do you really believe
the general will intervene?

520
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:55,291
Can you imagine it?
Caesar at Crassus' heels.

521
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:19,083
Stop!

522
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:22,375
Oboz is down there.
We'll surprise them in their sleep.

523
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,916
No one must remain alive.
Remember that! Go!

524
00:59:48,166 --> 00:59:50,916
It is Baxus's signal.
They are coming. Advise the others.

525
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:52,125
Yes.

526
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:07,500
It's Gular. This is it.

527
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:11,541
Wait for them to reach the center
of the village and then charge.

528
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:19,083
- Did you blend the mixture well?
- To perfection.

529
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:23,000
I worked 10 years
in the Egyptian sulphur mines.

530
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:27,291
Sulphur and Greek tar. The Lycians
will feel the heat on their backs.

531
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,500
- I promise.
- On the ruin of our homes.

532
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:33,208
You'll rebuild them one day,
even more lovely.

533
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,125
Here they are! They're coming!

534
01:00:56,708 --> 01:01:02,333
Go! Charge! Set fire
and kill, in the name of Crassus!

535
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,500
Kill!

536
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:08,041
Set fire to the roofs!

537
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:24,458
- On this side.
- We must catch them by surprise.

538
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:27,125
The homes are deserted.
They've all run away!

539
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:31,333
Damn them! Someone warned them.
They have spies at the palace!

540
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,541
Destroy everything!

541
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:40,291
Not one wall must be left standing.
Have no pity! Go!

542
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:46,875
When the village is destroyed,
we'll hunt them in the mountains.

543
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,416
Follow me!

544
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:28,666
Hurry! Let's leave the village.
We'll surround them.

545
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:37,750
Charge!

546
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:35,000
It's the two of us now!

547
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:41,625
Scum!

548
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:17,875
Being killed by the sword of Spartacus
will be an honor to you.

549
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,083
- And now?
- Leave your homes,

550
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:40,958
forget the past, reach the oases,
live in the caves,

551
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:43,750
on the mountains of Lubar,
in the ancient mines,

552
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:46,041
find refuge in the City of the Sun.

553
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:49,250
This is what Spartacus tells you
through his son's mouth.

554
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:52,916
Get ready for the day of payback.

555
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:00,958
Guards!

556
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,750
Guards!

557
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:05,875
Guards!

558
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:16,458
He managed to enter in here,
in my room,

559
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:19,000
in the most sacred place
of the palace.

560
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:23,125
This is a lair of traitors.
Their leader is here,

561
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:27,333
and could be anyone.
You, Vetius, or you.

562
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:31,750
- Or Randus.
- Right, Randus.

563
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:34,791
Where is he?
Why didn't he rush over too?

564
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,333
The German is guarding his door.
Maybe he's sleeping.

565
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:41,916
It's impossible.
He must have heard.

566
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:46,583
It all began with his arrival.
Rebellion, attacks, ambushes.

567
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:50,916
And that cursed "S" appeared
around since he came.

568
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:55,375
Then let's wake him,
if it's true that he is sleeping.

569
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,791
Break the door down!

570
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:29,791
By all the gods,
what is this commotion?

571
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,333
What's happening?
The rebels are in the city?

572
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:36,833
No. They are among us.
The law of war now goes into effect.

573
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:38,333
Really?

574
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:44,916
- Is it that serious?
- You will deprive us of your sword?

575
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,625
You are a consul of Rome,
so order, and you'll be obeyed.

576
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:56,625
Get out, leave me alone.

577
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:08,708
I will be very frank, Randus.

578
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:13,500
Caesar has finished performing
the role of friend with me.

579
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:17,291
He eliminated all his enemies

580
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,000
and it still isn't enough
for his cursed ambition.

581
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,583
But with Crassus,
the performance is different!

582
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:34,833
Ten years ago I lent Caesar
25 million sesterces

583
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:38,125
and I sent him to reap laurel plants
in Spain.

584
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:42,333
He was chased by creditors
like a hare with scanty fur.

585
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:46,000
But now I will spend my sesterces

586
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:51,791
to hurl Pharnaces and his army
on him.

587
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:57,333
- What do you think?
- Politics is not food for me.

588
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:59,666
Then you won't die of indigestion.

589
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:03,083
Tomorrow everyone will see that
Crassus still has so much energy

590
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:05,875
that he can wipe out his enemies.

591
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:11,083
It is up to you.
Either with me or against me.

592
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:15,916
I consider you too intelligent
to do something foolish.

593
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:30,791
If the hand that smears the walls
of the palace is led by Caesar,

594
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,000
we will soon know.

595
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:43,708
Crassus promised
an unforgettable performance.

596
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,916
He wants to win over the favor
of his guest, Manas,

597
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:51,041
King Pharnaces' brother,
and he will. Look. They're coming.

598
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,750
My noble Manas,
your presence honors us.

599
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:58,333
I hope you will be pleased
with our hospitality.

600
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:12,625
Hello, Randus. Crassus' celebration
will be a success with your presence.

601
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,833
You denied us your company
these last few days.

602
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:19,750
I hunted down the rebels.
Remember? I am a soldier.

603
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:25,791
But I could need your sword
and your presence too.

604
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,458
Nobody can hurt you.
A goddess isn't struck, but adored.

605
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:41,416
Listen, please. Today Crassus
will kill other innocent people.

606
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:46,875
You, who are so different
from the others, can save them.

607
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:52,208
I know they will be killed
in a horrible way.

608
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:56,125
- Save them, I beg you.
- I don't decide their destiny.

609
01:09:56,333 --> 01:10:01,333
They are rebels. Their leader
is the son of Spartacus, they say.

610
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:06,000
He must save them.
While I must stop him.

611
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:18,875
I will show you how I punish
my enemies without shedding blood,

612
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:22,958
and how I honor my guests.
- Thank you.

613
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:39,583
I bet 20 denarii that not even you
know what that tent is for.

614
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:41,833
It must be one of Crassus'
strange inventions.

615
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:45,375
A very entertaining evening
is being prepared.

616
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:50,041
I doubt that an idea from Crassus
can be entertaining.

617
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,166
Watch and see.

618
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,875
My noble prince, what you will see

619
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:34,333
is strictly fruit of my imagination.

620
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:38,083
If it is equal to the gold
you promised us for our alliance,

621
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:40,791
it will be extraordinary.

622
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,125
My brother is camped out in
the desert with such a numerous army

623
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:47,333
that it can exterminate your enemies

624
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:50,500
or have every broken promise
paid for with death.

625
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:53,000
- Crassus keeps his word.
- So much the better!

626
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,416
From the desert they say that Caesar
is marching towards Zeugma

627
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,791
and you are threatened
by the rebels

628
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,291
led by the son of Spartacus,
the Thracian that dared defy Rome.

629
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,333
It is the illusion
of a group of desperate men. Wait.

630
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,250
Uncover it.

631
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:33,458
They will die slowly. Life will
slip away from their bodies.

632
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:39,458
As soon as the urn will be filled
with vapors, justice will be done.

633
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:02,458
That way! Hurry!

634
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:15,500
Up there!

635
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:23,916
- Vetius!
- Guards! Get him!

636
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:55,750
Go! Get out! Run away!

637
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:08,250
Guards!

638
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:29,875
You'll pay for my death.

639
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:34,041
My brother's revenge
will drown you all in blood.

640
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:37,750
Vetius, round up the guards
and barricade the entrance.

641
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:47,541
The time for revenge
has come, Crassus.

642
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:51,416
The son of Spartacus will do
justice for his father's murder.

643
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,958
The lever! Hurry, Lumone!

644
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:11,000
Nobody can deceive Crassus!

645
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,958
Your end has come, slave!

646
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,208
Bravo, Lumone.
Vetius, get him out and kill him.

647
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:19,791
I want his head at my feet!

648
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:23,125
Raise the gates!

649
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,708
Finish him off! I want his head!

650
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:16,583
Pull him up.

651
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,000
Let's see his face.

652
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:29,666
Randus!

653
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:33,916
Stop!

654
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:37,333
This man must tell me
many things before dying.

655
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:41,083
- Throw him in a cell!
- You won't spare him, I hope.

656
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:44,875
No. I want to have him curse
the day he was born

657
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:47,250
before he begs for his death.

658
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,166
Take him away!

659
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:02,000
News of the capture
of that traitor has spread.

660
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:04,166
The population is in ferment.

661
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:07,541
Armed groups are occupying
some villages on the hills.

662
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:12,041
The garrison isn't sufficient
and the soldiers are afraid.

663
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,583
You should give a demonstration
of force by killing that dog now!

664
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:20,833
His death will show the rebels
that Crassus is stronger!

665
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,458
Kill him!
What are you waiting for?

666
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:28,166
Kill him right away, or the slaves
will invade your palace too!

667
01:17:28,375 --> 01:17:31,625
You are an imbecile, Vetius.

668
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:35,833
If you weren't, you wouldn't
have been my right arm

669
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:39,375
and my hitman.

670
01:17:39,583 --> 01:17:44,833
You would have long ago
poisoned me with a cup of wine.

671
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:48,000
Rebel slaves, revolts.
Those aren't the dangers.

672
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:52,000
Sooner or later Rome crushes.
As I crushed Spartacus 20 years ago.

673
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:57,541
Spartacus ended up on the cross.
Why not do the same with his son?

674
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,791
- Or is this old age?
- Don't say that.

675
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,750
Thank the gods that I allow you
to sleep in my bed,

676
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:09,000
instead of a brothel of Suburra.

677
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:14,333
The hour is close. Caesar advances
towards us in obliged stops.

678
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:17,000
He only has two legions,
but they are enough for him.

679
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:21,291
He knows that only Crassus is impeding
him, and wants to wipe him away.

680
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,541
And his system is not wrong.
It has never made mistakes.

681
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:32,875
Here there is Pharnaces,
greedy for gold and glory,

682
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,333
with an army that is superior
to Caesar's,

683
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:39,208
and 100 times stronger than ours.

684
01:18:39,416 --> 01:18:42,416
A multitude of Barbarians
led by a madman who,

685
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:46,833
in his sick mind, thinks
he can defeat the eagles of Rome.

686
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:52,583
Madness. Caesar would destroy him
in one clash.

687
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:54,875
But this will not take place.

688
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:59,291
I will lead that army
enslaved to my gold.

689
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,208
Pharnaces will receive the glory
of having stopped Caesar.

690
01:19:03,416 --> 01:19:07,708
And finally
Crassus will have power over Rome.

691
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,583
For Pharnaces' alliance,
gold is not enough.

692
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:16,000
We must deliver to him
the man who killed his brother.

693
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:22,541
He needs blood
to cancel other blood.

694
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:25,750
His executioners
will take care of the traitor.

695
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:29,875
I must reach Pharnaces
as soon as possible,

696
01:19:30,083 --> 01:19:32,875
give him the gold and the man,
suggest the tactic

697
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:36,000
in defeating the legions, and wait.

698
01:19:37,041 --> 01:19:40,875
Then we'll return to Zeugma,

699
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:43,666
to Alexandria.

700
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:46,958
To Rome!

701
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,416
Prepare an armed escort.
Have the gold loaded,

702
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:55,916
and lock up the prisoner in a cage.
We'll leave the city after sunset

703
01:19:56,125 --> 01:20:00,291
and in three days we'll return
with the army that defeated Caesar.

704
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,041
Wait.

705
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:07,750
That decurion, Lumone...

706
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:13,958
I've the impression that
he has lived enough.

707
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,875
Randus! Listen to me!

708
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:37,291
I have little time.
Crassus must not get me.

709
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:43,666
I couldn't believe my eyes
when I saw that is was you.

710
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,333
I couldn't believe it.

711
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:51,916
Forgive me, Randus,
but now I know what I should do.

712
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:54,833
- What?
- Caesar is 50 leagues from here.

713
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:57,875
I must warn him that Pharnaces' army
is threatening him.

714
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:01,333
Tell Caesar that I tried to serve him,

715
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:05,166
by serving also those
who suffer in slavery.

716
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:09,166
Until slaves exist,
there will be rebels

717
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,625
ready to give their life
for freedom.

718
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,250
If Rome is for crosses,
I am against Rome.

719
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:22,166
- Tell that to Caesar.
- Caesar is a just man.

720
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:26,833
- He will be merciful.
- Go, Lumone!

721
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:31,958
Farewell, Randus.
May the gods help me.

722
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,500
- Where is the Roman? Stop!
- Farewell, Randus!

723
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:27,166
Where are you going?

724
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:31,166
To Caesar.

725
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,541
The camp is ready, Crassus.

726
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,833
Go on, hurry.

727
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:01,750
I want double guards to watch over
my gold and my sleep.

728
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:05,500
I am tired. I need to rest.

729
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:14,458
I must be wide awake
tomorrow morning with Pharnaces.

730
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:17,666
It will be done, Crassus.

731
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:28,416
You are still alive, but not for long.

732
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:31,625
Finally you lowered
your false friend mask.

733
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:35,750
You ended up in a cage
like an animal.

734
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,333
You could have had riches
and power.

735
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:43,000
Instead, you chose the cross, Randus!
It will be your tribune toga!

736
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:50,458
We shall go too..

737
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:14,458
Go. I don't want anything
to happen to you.

738
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:18,416
Save yourself. You must escape.
I brought your sword.

739
01:25:20,958 --> 01:25:23,333
Hurry, cut here.

740
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,708
Give it to me.

741
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:47,291
Go on, friends. Shoot!

742
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's our turn! Charge!

743
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:28,166
Go on! Hurry! Surround the tent!
You, over there!

744
01:26:35,041 --> 01:26:36,625
Your hour has come!

745
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,708
Baxus! No!

746
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,583
- Mine or yours, master?
- He's mine!

747
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,916
And now let's take care of Crassus.

748
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:09,791
What do you want to do?

749
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,833
The Egyptians also taught me this.

750
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:16,708
Gold melts like butter,
but it's harder to digest.

751
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:19,875
Randus! Save me! Don't kill me!

752
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:23,833
Don't have me killed.
I am a Roman consul.

753
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:29,083
It's useless.
You condemned your own self.

754
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:32,291
The slaves and the oppressed
judged you.

755
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:36,750
And I, as a Roman soldier,
see an enemy of Rome in you.

756
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,958
You won't buy an army
to fight Caesar.

757
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:43,416
In exchange for my life,
I promise you freedom!

758
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:49,708
And gold! You'll have so much gold
you won't be able to count it.

759
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:52,583
Ask! It's gold!

760
01:28:52,875 --> 01:28:56,708
Gold! It's not enough
to pay for their injuries

761
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:59,833
and a life of suffering and misery.

762
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:04,958
- They are yours.
- Randus! Don't have them kill me!

763
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:08,250
I don't want to die!
Saida, I beg you. Save me!

764
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:12,041
I have always treated you well.

765
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,875
Please, save me.

766
01:29:26,625 --> 01:29:30,041
She is a woman. Let her live.

767
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:44,958
You are free, but remember
that you owe your life to a slave.

768
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:48,125
Lead her to the dunes
and let her go.

769
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:58,333
Clodia! Clodia, don't leave me!
I don't want to die!

770
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,750
Take me away.

771
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:05,500
- Grab him!
- Hold him!

772
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:14,125
You say you're the richest man
in Rome. You'll be even more so.

773
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:18,500
You accumulated gold by
spilling blood. Now you'll drink it.

774
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:32,166
Here. Some water and dates.

775
01:30:33,416 --> 01:30:38,291
Give me a knife.
It will be more useful.

776
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,750
What awaits you now, Randus?

777
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:51,916
Who knows. Maybe a new life,
maybe death.

778
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:58,500
In revenging my father, I hoped
to help the cause of justice.

779
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:02,000
- And that isn't so?
- I don't know.

780
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:07,958
I am a Roman citizen
but now everything is different.

781
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:15,458
These people elected me as
their leader. I can't abandon them.

782
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:20,208
We defeated Crassus, but
the fight for freedom will be long.

783
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:25,541
I am not afraid, and wherever
you'll be, that will be my home.

784
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:29,833
I am ready to follow you, Randus.
Always.

785
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:34,791
My freedom, my life...

786
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,583
is you, my love.

787
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Randus! The Roman cavalry
is advancing from behind the hill!

788
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:08,916
Let's attack them. They'll chop us up,
but at least we'll die as men.

789
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:14,333
Deliver yourself to Caesar, Randus.
Caesar will judge.

790
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:18,916
Gular, I am going to Caesar.
Don't move.

791
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,208
I had ordered you to observe
Crassus' movements.

792
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:48,750
- But not like this.
- I did my duty.

793
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:53,625
The plot was unveiled. The man
who killed my father is dead.

794
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:58,916
- Now it's my turn.
- No man, free or a slave,

795
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:01,541
knows the hour of his death.

796
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:07,125
If you are who the people shout
about, the son of Spartacus,

797
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:09,916
you'll understand why Rome
cannot allow you to live.

798
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:14,041
- I don't ask for anything.
- Nor can you have anything.

799
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:19,125
The problem with our lives
is not just freedom,

800
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:21,750
but in the force of things.

801
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:25,458
I entrusted the region's
government to Verulus.

802
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:28,666
He is a just man.
If the order will not be disobeyed,

803
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:31,041
many chains will be broken.

804
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,541
But Nature doesn't admit discounts.

805
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:39,750
You must die.

806
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:47,083
You are an example, no longer a man.
Rome must have one, too.

807
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:49,916
You will die on the cross
like your father,

808
01:34:50,125 --> 01:34:54,708
and the others will see how it's
not possible to rebel against Rome.

809
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:03,708
You have been a good soldier
and a faithful friend.

810
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,958
Caesar says farewell.

811
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:09,083
What will happen to the others?

812
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,250
They will live.

813
01:36:13,916 --> 01:36:15,375
Look!

814
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:15,708
The entire Zeugma population is here
as the voice of the rebel's death.

815
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:38,375
One cross is not sufficient,
Caesar!

816
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:41,666
If you kill the son of Spartacus,
you must kill us all!

817
01:37:41,916 --> 01:37:46,625
Don't take away the man
who freed us, or crucify us too.

818
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:50,166
Even now, just as we did
20 years ago,

819
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:53,291
we say to you, "I am Spartacus!"

820
01:37:53,583 --> 01:37:59,041
Caesar, listen to their voice!
Rome is the world, and you are Rome!

821
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,791
There isn't enough wood
for so many crosses.

822
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:13,375
We are in the desert.
Isn't that so, Verulus?

823
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:18,416
Yes, general, and never assigned
governor of a people who are dead.

824
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:22,416
Let him be liberated!

825
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:56,708
- Farewell, Randus, and good luck.
- Farewell, friend.

826
01:38:56,916 --> 01:39:00,416
Now we have really won,
and forever. Come, Randus!

827
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:05,416
Here is your father's sword.

828
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:27,125
Farewell, Verulus.
Many times, a word of clemency

829
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:30,750
can be more useful to Rome
than the use of the sword.

830
01:39:30,958 --> 01:39:33,583
- Farewell, Caesar.
- Let's go!

831
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:49,000
Forward!

832
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:54,875
Forward!

833
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:58,000
There will always be a hand
ready to grasp it

834
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:01,083
in defense of freedom
and of human dignity.

835
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:04,208
And every man who rebels
against repression

836
01:41:04,416 --> 01:41:08,708
will always be able to say,
"I am the son of Spartacus".
