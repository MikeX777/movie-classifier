1
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,166
In order to set up a holding company,

2
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:07,750
you're required to provide
your retina scan, fingerprints, and DNA.

3
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,791
What's the DNA for?

4
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,916
'Cause you can get your retina
and fingerprints transplanted.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,708
VEGA'S FILMS HAVE MADE
$112,000,000

6
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,958
Mr. PATRYK,

7
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,958
what do you intend
to spend the funds on?

8
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,916
PATRYK...

9
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,625
We won't pass together. I'll go first...

10
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,208
and you'll follow on my mark...

11
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,833
you'll follow me, you hear me?

12
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,375
You'll manage.

13
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:38,833
Don't look down.

14
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,541
Don't look...
Don't think about it...

15
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,125
Don't look down.

16
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,416
Don't look down.

17
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,666
- Mom!
- I'm good, son!

18
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,666
Everything's fine.

19
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,750
Very well, son.

20
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,416
Your turn. Slowly, slowly...

21
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,833
On your knees...

22
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,375
Yes. Proceed slowly.

23
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,125
Hang on.

24
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,833
Don't look... Look at me...
Look at me... PATRYK...

25
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,750
Don't think about the height.
Look at me.

26
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,625
Move slowly.

27
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,583
Like that.

28
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,875
Nice.

29
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,750
Wait.

30
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,125
Listen... I wouldn't have let you go
if I hadn't known you'd manage.

31
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:51,000
You can't move back,
or you'll fall.

32
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,250
You must move on.

33
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,500
You can do it.

34
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:59,083
Because you're the best.
I believe in you.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,166
Do you?

36
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,250
Yes, son.

37
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,750
Do you really?

38
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:15,500
Yes, I believe in you, son.
I believe in you.

39
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:16,875
Come.

40
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,208
Almost there.

41
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,000
Why don't I have a father?

42
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,375
- Why are you asking?
- All children do.

43
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,166
He's gone to the States for work.
He hasn't come back.

44
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,791
I'll find him, when I grow up.

45
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,625
Stay here.

46
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:06,541
Mom, please! Let me out!
I'll never say that again, I promise.

47
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,583
- What are you writing, grandpa?
- A movie title.

48
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,500
- What movie?
- The one I've seen at the cinema lately.

49
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,625
In this notebook,

50
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,958
I write down the title
of every movie I see.

51
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:27,625
The date of its production,
its cast, and the director's name.

52
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,083
Wanna go to the movies?

53
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,416
- Pick the flowers.
- Why?

54
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,958
There you go.

55
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,875
Now you can afford the tickets.

56
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,458
Will we come here again?

57
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,458
This is Elżbieta.
Your father's new wife.

58
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,583
I brought you a gift
from your dad.

59
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:09,166
These blocks are very expensive. They're
worth a few of my monthly salaries.

60
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,833
I'll unpack them.
Put them in two bags.

61
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,041
Mix them with Polish blocks.
And I'll sell them as two sets.

62
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:03,750
- Where are the spaceship's wings?
- They're here somewhere.

63
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,041
When I grow up,
I'll take care of you.

64
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,375
You won't have to work ever again.

65
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,916
You're already taking care of me. Son.

66
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,875
Thank you.

67
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,375
- Grandpa...
- So he's gone?

68
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,958
Mom, I'm to recite a poem
during a school ceremony.

69
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,666
Don't worry about it.
We'll cover it with a sweater.

70
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,166
And remember:

71
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,500
- you're the best.
- At what?

72
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,000
At everything.

73
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,125
When I grow up, I'll marry you.

74
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay.

75
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,000
- Take it off.
- Do I have to?

76
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,916
Everyone's wearing shirts.
You look odd.

77
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,833
Soldier... I look into your eyes...

78
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,291
Soldier... I look into your eyes...

79
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,875
Soldier... I look into your eyes...

80
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:54,625
and remember your noble struggle
for the glory of our homeland...

81
00:10:56,375 --> 00:11:00,916
What have you done? You've ruined
the whole performance! So much work!

82
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to borrow it.

83
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,208
HOW TO MANIPULATE

84
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,583
This one!

85
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,625
This car, please.

86
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,583
- You want it? I'll buy it for you.
- I don't want it.

87
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,625
- Don't be shy. I'll get you one.
- No.

88
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,291
- Take it. Auntie wants to buy it for you.
- No.

89
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,625
- Why not?
- I don't want it.

90
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,833
Okay.

91
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,208
Come.

92
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,458
Why didn't you want that car?

93
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:02,541
I wanted to see what she'd do,
if I did something unpredictable.

94
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,666
Know what, mom?
Make me some soft-boiled eggs.

95
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:12,666
Okay.

96
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,458
Or fried.

97
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,000
Or hard-boiled.

98
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,541
You know me too well.

99
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:44,958
Yes!

100
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,750
Diego!

101
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,958
Diego Armando Maradona!

102
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll be a new Maradona!

103
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:55,208
I'll be the best soccer player
in the world! We'll be rich!

104
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,250
I told you! I told you, Pacio, didn't I!

105
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,833
Yes! Yes!

106
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,041
I'm done playing.

107
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,000
- Why?
- 'Cause I won't be the best.

108
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,250
What are you gonna do?

109
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:30,625
I'll make millions in another way.
Perhaps, I'll become a rock singer.

110
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,958
Or my hair
in the 7 colors of the rainbow.

111
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,416
This way, or another,
I'm doomed to be successful.

112
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,583
A rock singer. Great.

113
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,375
Hi.

114
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,500
- Hi.
- What's that?

115
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,041
- What do you think? King Diamond.
- Don't you listen to metal?

116
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,041
This is Ole from Sweden.

117
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,583
He wants me to go there with him.

118
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,833
Pacio...

119
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,750
It's my chance to make a lot of money.

120
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,250
You'll stay with Aunt Gosia.

121
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:17,666
I want a pentagram etched on the front.
And an inverted cross on the back.

122
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,291
You know what I'll buy you
with all the money I've made?

123
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,375
- What?
- A computer!

124
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:42,041
- I'll be the first kid in class that has one.
- Yes!

125
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,791
Can I have this cassette?

126
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:56,750
Mom!

127
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,166
Why should I pay for it,
if they can pay me?

128
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,166
- I wanna buy games from you.
- Which ones? - All of them.

129
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:10,041
I wanna sell them.
Will you help me set up my stand?

130
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:15,208
Maniek is a hacker. He has a modem and
gets the latest stuff for the entire Fair.

131
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,625
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,083
That's all for today.

133
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,833
- See you.
- Copy this.

134
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,000
Show some respect.

135
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,916
What's up?

136
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,416
I want to cut off the entire Fair
from computer novelties.

137
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,833
I'll pay five times more than they do
for exclusivity.

138
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,666
We need the new stuff
before the weekend.

139
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,416
State your price.

140
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:55,333
There's no good price.
From now on, you'll buy them from me

141
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,125
no sooner than on Saturday.
And remember: I'm like a shark.

142
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:03,250
- What'd you mean?
- I can't tell a friend from food.

143
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,583
- What's new on the list?
- There you go.

144
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,916
See if the cheese is good,
so that Kubuś won't get the squirts.

145
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,416
It's okay.

146
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,208
This is the future.

147
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,000
5-10-15?

148
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,416
Computer animations.

149
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,750
I'll learn how to make them,
and I'll earn a fortune.

150
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,083
I'll make an intro for them.

151
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,041
Okay.

152
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:52,125
With us is PATRYK, the maker of the
computer-generated intro we've just seen.

153
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:56,458
- Is it difficult to make?
- A 3D animation is like making a movie.

154
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,083
Objects are your actors,
you plan the camera movement,

155
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,333
set the light, select the textures of the
materials you overlay the objects with.

156
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,625
- Who taught you that?
- I'm self-taught.

157
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,375
PATRYK has just been entered
into the Guinness Book of Records

158
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,291
as the youngest creator
of professional computer-generated intros.

159
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,833
What are you doing?

160
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,916
I have no heart to whack it
with a hammer.

161
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,541
I'm waiting for it to drown.

162
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:35,416
Your father is coming to Poland.
He wants to see you.

163
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,916
Shall I let him?

164
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,625
Let him give you money
for a new computer.

165
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,125
He hasn't given a shit about us
his entire life.

166
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:47,250
The only thing he sent you from America
was Lego blocks and powdered milk.

167
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,583
Let him feel responsible now.

168
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,583
What do you like, PATRYK?

169
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,416
I make computer animations. I'm planning
to buy an Amiga 3000 computer.

170
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:01,333
When I have it, I'll start making
professional intros for television

171
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,041
- and earn a lot of money.
- What will you have?

172
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,375
Tiramisu.

173
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,166
- Same for me.
- Very well.

174
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,333
Help me buy that computer.

175
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,250
How much is it?

176
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,083
4,000 dollars.

177
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,083
I can send you the money
in two months.

178
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,375
- Anything from my father?
- No.

179
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,083
He was to have sent
the money two months ago.

180
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,666
- Write him.
- That he let me down again...

181
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,916
And that I don't want to see him again.

182
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,875
Pacio...

183
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,333
I'll take out a loan.
I'll buy you that computer.

184
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,041
The loan has worked out so bad for you,

185
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,791
because we've had
a redenomination in Poland today.

186
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,958
Meaning?

187
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,041
A currency reform introducing
a new monetary unit

188
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,083
to replace the old one.

189
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,208
One new Polish Zloty is
an equivalent of 10,000 old ones.

190
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,750
It's processing really slow.
10 seconds will take a week.

191
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:12,083
In September, I'll take my new animation
to the TVP. We'll start making millions.

192
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,833
I hope.

193
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,375
Or we'll have huge problems.

194
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,583
I'd like to show you my animation.

195
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:29,166
Great, but my priority is to secure jobs
of those working for the television.

196
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,791
Perhaps I could do
an extra job for you.

197
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:36,791
- We're not seeking cooperation.
- I thought... - I must be going.

198
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:47,791
Another thing worth mentioning
in terms of the narration style

199
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,458
was the application
of black-and-white photos in the movie.

200
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,166
But a director of Spielberg's caliber
could afford

201
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,666
- this type of innovations in the cinema.
- Where did you find this review?

202
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,625
- What do you mean?
- What did you copy it from?

203
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,083
- I wrote it myself.
- Impossible.

204
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,208
- The bitch thinks I stole it.
- How can she?

205
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,625
I don't know. Keep watch.

206
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,000
I have a great idea.
We'll take out a loan.

207
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:32,458
We'll buy a stolen vehicle
and resell it for profit.

208
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,458
- Will you give me a receipt for the money?
- Sure.

209
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,875
And I'll write
in it the car's been stolen.

210
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,916
Don't worry.
The money's no longer yours.

211
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,250
Okay.

212
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,083
- Where's the car?
- There's no car. - How come?

213
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,000
- Kazek took the money. He's off the grid.
- Pay it back. I took out a loan.

214
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,708
- What do I have to do with it?
- You recommended him.

215
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,875
We've been in the same school
for 5 years.

216
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:10,250
You shouldn't have given him the money.

217
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:15,500
I have a friend who knows a mafia guy.
They say he hates redheads.

218
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,750
Perhaps, he'll help us.

219
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:25,916
There's one more important thing.
He has red hair.

220
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,416
We'll take him to the woods.

221
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,083
Where's my money?

222
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,875
Ask the Wołomin gang.

223
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,166
What do you mean?

224
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,833
Uh-huh...

225
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,041
I get it.

226
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,791
They said the money's not good enough
for them to go to war with Wołomin.

227
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,875
Okay, since he couldn't be kidnapped...

228
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,416
I'll go see his mother.

229
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:18,208
- You had my son taken out to the woods.
- Your son and Wołomin robbed my son.

230
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,750
I get it.

231
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,791
But it's not right.

232
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,750
Let's find some solution
together, like mothers.

233
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,583
How?

234
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:37,250
You sell baguets, you can
pay me off in monthly instalments.

235
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,416
Cheers.

236
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,625
If you wanna have a drink,
bring your buddies home.

237
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,416
I don't want you to drink
out in the bushes.

238
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,666
Want some?

239
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:12,750
Are you coming with us
to booze at Zegrze, Kulpa?

240
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,375
We'll take my Syrena.

241
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,875
- What about your trash?
- I'll bring a can for it tomorrow.

242
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,791
Wanna go to Zegrze like this?

243
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:28,041
My transmission's blown.
I can only drive in reverse.

244
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:40,500
Look at that bum.

245
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,375
Let's search him.

246
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,333
Give us the mullah.

247
00:24:55,958 --> 00:25:00,791
- Shut the fuck up and give us your money.
- Okay, he's had enough.

248
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:13,375
- He has this.
- What's this key for?

249
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,416
A locker at the Central Train Station.

250
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:22,500
I have a hunch. We'll find
a million dollars in that suitcase.

251
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:30,208
What's in there?

252
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:31,916
Fucking grunt.

253
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,083
Wanna make a million dollars?
Start dealing drugs.

254
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,375
I know a guy who has amphetamine.
Wanna start dealing?

255
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,166
Got it? How much?

256
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,375
- Two.
- Got a lot of it?

257
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:54,958
No dealing outside my club
without my consent.

258
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:32,291
I started dealing amphetamine.
This is for you, mom.

259
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,375
Thank you, son.

260
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,833
I no longer have anyone
to borrow from.

261
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,958
Can I go to Sweden?
There's a school trip.

262
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,291
- Let's steal some perfume.
- No way.

263
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,791
Fuck you.

264
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:30,958
Sweden, Karlskrona

265
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,166
Open your backpack, please.

266
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,041
You'll come with us.

267
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,791
I'm an interpreter.

268
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:07,625
- Tell me what I should do.
- Tell the truth.

269
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:19,416
Okay.

270
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,000
I confess.

271
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,833
I stole that perfume.
What's gonna happen to me?

272
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,875
Will I go to prison in Sweden?

273
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:47,666
The Swedish police assume the crime
was committed on Polish waters.

274
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:51,083
You'll be deported to Poland.
The local police will take you over.

275
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,666
You'll make the return trip
in a detention cabin.

276
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,458
Do you confess?

277
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,625
Yes.

278
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,625
Sign here.

279
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,416
God must've been watching over you.

280
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:13,875
Why?

281
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,958
They've changed the law

282
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,041
regarding forced entry
and aggravated larceny.

283
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,625
Last month you would've gone
straight to jail.

284
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:22,875
And now?

285
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,666
You'll be awaiting trial at home.

286
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,000
Jesus...

287
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,833
thank you for saving me from jail.

288
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,500
I'm begging you to forgive me.

289
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:35,250
I'll never do it again.

290
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:38,125
Jesus, I fail at everything.

291
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:41,125
I no longer know what to do in life.

292
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,625
I'm begging you... tell me...

293
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,625
I did something stupid.
I got drunk and made a mistake.

294
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,541
I don't want to waste my life.

295
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:04,250
Will you ask the school
board not to expel me?

296
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:09,958
If I convince them...
what will you do with your life?

297
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,416
I'll make movies.

298
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,750
What movies?

299
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,583
The first time I killed a man,
I threw up.

300
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,416
The second time, I had lunch.

301
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,833
Cut! Awesome!

302
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,791
The fuck you're looking at?

303
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,125
Got a problem, punk?

304
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,000
Next time, remember
to say 'excuse me'.

305
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,291
Excuse me.

306
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,416
Punk-ass sucker.

307
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,000
Dump the piece.

308
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,250
The dude will call the cops.

309
00:31:39,416 --> 00:31:40,625
Fuck off.

310
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:41,916
Ugh...

311
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:46,333
- Yes?
- Did you film me falling in that cool place?

312
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:49,458
Great,
'cause it was fucking awesome.

313
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:51,125
Let's split.

314
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,833
- Don't confess to anything.
- Hey! No talking!

315
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:05,708
Alcohol recovery center

316
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,541
It wasn't us. He was more drunk
than us. He confused us.

317
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:25,250
Do you know where you are?

318
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:28,500
Homicide Department of the police
station at Malczewskiego Street.

319
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:31,666
Can you call my mother
and tell her where I am?

320
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:34,500
- She must be worried.
- Had we found anything on you,

321
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,541
you would've been
at Rakowiecka by now.

322
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:40,250
Do you know how they treat a man
with long hair there?

323
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,625
- Like a woman.
- Do I look like a gangster to you?

324
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:49,208
Thank you very much,
but I can't help you.

325
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,416
Why?

326
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:54,916
Because in Poland a family name
can't be spelt with "V", "X","Y".

327
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,083
Ma'am,

328
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,625
next week I'm leaving
the country for good.

329
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,958
I'm begging you, change my name.

330
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,875
No one can pronounce
'PATRYK Krzemieniecki' in America.

331
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:11,083
And you'll never hear of me again.

332
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:15,166
Since you're emigrating...

333
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,833
What name do you want?

334
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,625
PATRYK Krzemieniecki.

335
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,208
He's gone.

336
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:28,375
From now on my name is
PATRYK Sebastian

337
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,291
Vega.

338
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,125
PATRYK Sebastian Vega...

339
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:41,333
I've read your mock matura paper
on the Renaissance.

340
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,041
I gave you an 'A'.

341
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:46,333
I want you to read it out to the class.

342
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,125
A huge palace emerges before my eyes.

343
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:04,041
I open its double-wing door
with a screech.

344
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,041
I pace along the hall,

345
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:10,750
peering into the rooms of Rej,

346
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,458
Kochanowski,

347
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,208
Górnicki,

348
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:15,833
Janicki,

349
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,041
Skarga, Szymonowic.

350
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,166
Today...

351
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,625
I will visit all of them.

352
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:28,125
First, I call on Kochanowski,

353
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,958
grieving over his deceased daughter
while writing a threnody.

354
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:35,375
I grab a bottle of liquor

355
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,333
and pour him and myself a drink.

356
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,500
I sit down next to him
and we start talking

357
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,416
about his trauma of losing his child...

358
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:51,291
I'm drawing the shots for the first
scene of my movie.

359
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:55,291
What if I placed several dozen
cameras around the protagonist,

360
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:59,958
had him filmed simultaneously, and then
merged the shots into one whole?

361
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:05,041
Let's begin your final exam in Polish.
Here are your questions:

362
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:06,541
"What is courage?"

363
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:11,916
I move my hand along her naked body.
I slide it toward her crotch,

364
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:15,250
where two droplets
of her juice are shimmering.

365
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:16,916
I lean over

366
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,666
and kiss them away.

367
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,625
I can feel her quiver
under the warmth of my breath.

368
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,833
Her greedy eyes

369
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,083
are begging me to continue.

370
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:31,125
I plunge my tongue inside her
and start moving it around.

371
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,750
Casually at first,
then rhythmically,

372
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:36,250
savoring her pungent taste...

373
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,666
And this is what I call courage.

374
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:44,750
Mom!

375
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:47,000
Ewa!

376
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,916
Look! These cunts have stolen my idea.

377
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,000
- What are we gonna do now?
- I'll apply

378
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,083
to the directorial department.

379
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:05,458
Have you seen "The Serpent's Egg"?

380
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,625
No.

381
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,916
Does the name Ingmar Bergman

382
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,916
ring a bell to you?

383
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,500
Know what? Ingmar Bergman...

384
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:25,750
is a director I watch as part
of the "Cinema Masters" series.

385
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:29,750
I know directors and movies
you've never even heard of.

386
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,333
The exam is over.

387
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,083
Best of luck to you.

388
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,916
This movie is...
a visual orgasm for me.

389
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,875
I already know which school
I wanna go to.

390
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,458
I wanna be like Agent Clarice Sterling
from "the Silence of the Lambs".

391
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,833
I've come to enroll for the exam.

392
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:42,333
You're late. The resocialization
department is no longer accepting.

393
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,166
Come back next year.

394
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:47,166
I have invented
a brilliant murder scene.

395
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:51,625
I drive needles into the victim's body,
and hang an electric heater over him

396
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,250
which causes the guy
to bleed out slowly.

397
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,416
The recruitment office
wants to draft you,

398
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,125
because you didn't get into college.

399
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:06,541
- I'll create a character for them.
- What character?

400
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,166
A chronic alcoholic.

401
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:14,208
I'll check in a mental hospital
and play my role in front of a doctor.

402
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:17,583
I'll stand in front of the army
medical board and inform them

403
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,250
I'm undergoing a psychiatric
treatment as an alcoholic.

404
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,625
You're seeing the board on Friday.
Today is Wednesday

405
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:28,041
No one will check I've been
in rehab for just one day.

406
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,750
I started drinking...

407
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,208
in elementary school.

408
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:43,833
Every time I got...

409
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,458
a poor grade...

410
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,541
or something bad happened...

411
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:55,208
to me.

412
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:01,083
I had to have a drink.

413
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:09,208
And you've had a drink today,
haven't you?

414
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,833
Sadly, yes.

415
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:24,666
Sir...

416
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:29,250
try not to drink at least
until the end of the week.

417
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,458
How many times did you answer "yes"?

418
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:44,250
8 out of 10...
But this test seems a bit exaggerated.

419
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:46,958
Amazing...

420
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,250
That professional hit woman is amazing.
Who's gonna play her?

421
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:54,750
There's that actress
from "Radio Romance"...

422
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,291
Małgorzata Foremniak.

423
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,333
What's up?

424
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,416
- Foremniak.
- What?

425
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:08,000
That actress, over there on the bench.

426
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,875
Wait a second.

427
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,458
Hello.

428
00:41:15,125 --> 00:41:17,750
Sorry to bother...

429
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:22,666
My son... has created a character
of an assassin for you.

430
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,416
Don't be surprised, then,
if one day he'll call you with an offer

431
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,791
to act in his movie.

432
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,750
Why doesn't he come see me
in the theater this Friday?

433
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,375
With the screenplay.

434
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,458
Seriously?

435
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,750
- Hello. This is for you.
- Thank you.

436
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,458
I've shown your screenplay
to Waldemar Dziki.

437
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:49,541
He's a film producer.
He's read it and the dialogs shocked him.

438
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:50,791
I'm not surprised.

439
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,666
What do you intend to do
with this screenplay?

440
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:05,416
Give me a million dollars, and I'll
turn it into an Oscar-winning movie.

441
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:10,791
- I can employ you as a secretary.
- That'd be cool, too.

442
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:15,333
Black coffee for me.
Two spoonfuls.

443
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:20,625
Spoonful's like a spoon for soup?

444
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,458
Nevermind.

445
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:37,208
I've no time for such petty shit,
so stop wasting my fucking time.

446
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,958
You sound like an American movie hero.

447
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:44,458
- Let me write something as an experiment.
- Like what?

448
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:49,500
You and your team are working on a new
series. I want to write one episode.

449
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,333
Take it...

450
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,875
That's not...

451
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,458
Fuck! You can't do that!

452
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,083
Get out!

453
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,625
Fuck! You can't do that!

454
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,333
You can't do things like that...

455
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,333
Okay... Take it then...

456
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,375
Why not?

457
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,625
Maybe I have it.

458
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,958
Maybe I don't.

459
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes. Yes, ghost. Fucking kill me!

460
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:32,416
It's not working out for you?

461
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,208
PATRYK,

462
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:46,166
Marek Miller,

463
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:49,250
my friend, a journalist,
and an originator.

464
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,875
We've read your episode...

465
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,833
and fired the screenwriting team.

466
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,625
You'll write the series.

467
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,958
PATRYK Vega, it's a pleasure.

468
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,791
What did you get your degree in?

469
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,666
Sociology.

470
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,125
It gave me humanist education,

471
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:14,166
and led me to journalism.

472
00:44:14,958 --> 00:44:19,833
To get in, I invented a book
entitled "Who Let the Journalists in".

473
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,166
In one fell swoop, I met

474
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:26,750
the most influential reporters. Yes...

475
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:33,000
My mentors are the three "K's" -
Krall, Kapuściński, and Kąkolewski.

476
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:35,666
I lecture in a reportage school.

477
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:39,500
Postgraduate studies based on
a master-apprentice relationship

478
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:44,750
where students gather materials
for the lecturers' true works.

479
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:48,375
Yes, the lecturers' true works.

480
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,583
Isn't it plagiarism?

481
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,333
But...

482
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,291
Such a straggler, such a...
nobody from God knows where.

483
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:06,750
And still, you can ask...
such matter-of-fact questions.

484
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:09,166
You've convinced me.

485
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,291
- I'll study the same thing.
- What's that?

486
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:16,666
Sociology and journalism.

487
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:19,083
I'll do two majors in one go.

488
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,166
And whom do you want to be?

489
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:27,208
Neither a sociologist, nor a journalist.
Sociology will give me sound education

490
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,958
that will be a back round
for my film-directing work.

491
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,041
And your reportage school
will teach me

492
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,958
to professionally
gather materials for my screenplays.

493
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:37,916
I promise I'll pay my tuition
next month.

494
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:41,250
I have a full-time job as a secretary,

495
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:44,750
doing day and evening
courses at the same time.

496
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:47,625
How do you manage to study, then?

497
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,333
Actually...

498
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,750
I'd like to request an individual
course of study for me.

499
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:59,583
I want to do a 5-year MA course,

500
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,500
and a postgraduate one
in 2 years, dean.

501
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:07,125
But you'll have over 20 exams
in each session.

502
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:09,625
I know.

503
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:15,041
In our lectures, we'll retrace the history
of the philosophical thought...

504
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,833
Well... perhaps not all of us.

505
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:25,416
There's a locker in Auschwitz
that contains 20,000 prisoners' accounts.

506
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,875
We'll read them all. What for?

507
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:32,875
In the 50th we'll find a statement
of a prisoner that claims to have survived

508
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,666
the longest roll call
in the history of Auschwitz.

509
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,750
After a breakout, they were forced

510
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:41,000
to stand up for two days,
and many of them died.

511
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:45,041
150 accounts later,
we'll find an account of a prisoner

512
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:49,875
who also took part in that roll call
but stood at a different spot.

513
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:54,458
By collecting all those accounts, we'll
be able to recreate a panoramic scene

514
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,500
told not by a writer,

515
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:02,041
but prisoners from all over the world.
Why are we doing this?

516
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:05,541
To create an Auschwitz chronicle.

517
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:07,583
An Auschwitz chronicle, yes.

518
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:11,083
We'll spend a few weeks here.

519
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,000
Questions?

520
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:18,166
Can I sleep in Rudolf Hess's study
with the view of the gallows?

521
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:25,208
I think it's a very positive place.

522
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:28,250
I might fall in love here.

523
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,250
Why?

524
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:36,625
The closeness of death
makes you appreciate life.

525
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:43,625
There's strong energy here, but I feel...
things have turned around over the years.

526
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,000
Now it is a space
where nothing is trivial.

527
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,958
Everything you experience here
becomes...

528
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:54,000
extremely intense.

529
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,375
Everything.

530
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,375
Magda, our new secretary.

531
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:04,583
Who am I, then?

532
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:06,416
A journalist.

533
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,041
You'll make reportages for Polsat

534
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:12,083
about children
from dysfunctional families.

535
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,250
When do we begin?

536
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,166
These are the conditions they live in.

537
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:22,625
The eldest girl has a brain tumor.

538
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,208
But no one comes to treat her.

539
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,416
Hey.

540
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,625
What're you doing, kid?

541
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,583
- Interesting.
- What?

542
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:44,750
The world doesn't look
like Warsaw, after all.

543
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:46,791
Is that so?

544
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:52,250
In 2 hours you're shooting the mother
of a child murdered in the woods.

545
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:54,000
Awesome.

546
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,250
Wait.

547
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:01,500
What if I shot the lady's statement
at the scene of the crime?

548
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:04,416
- It'll be too dark.
- Get a flashlight.

549
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,500
- What?
- I'll illuminate your face.

550
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:11,250
Tell us how your child was murdered.

551
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:17,791
Bartek was walking down the road...

552
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,791
when he approached him from the back...

553
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,625
and stabbed him with a knife.

554
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,916
He knocked him down to the ground...

555
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:29,125
and kept stabbing...

556
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,875
several times...

557
00:49:33,791 --> 00:49:36,000
He dragged him to the bushes...

558
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:40,666
My child...

559
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,041
He killed my child...

560
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,791
He killed my child...

561
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:47,166
The murderer killed my child...

562
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,500
My child...

563
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:50,250
My child...

564
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:54,458
I have nothing to live for!

565
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:58,541
How did you feel then?

566
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,333
Yes?

567
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:08,375
Kill me! I don't want to live!

568
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:11,500
He killed my child!

569
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,541
Doesn't it move you a bit?

570
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,583
The mother ended up
in a psych ward after the interview.

571
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,750
But we have a good story.

572
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:32,333
Borsukowa's sleeping with a guy
from the homicide department.

573
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,333
Perhaps you'd like to meet him and get
some materials for your screenplay?

574
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,666
Sure.

575
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:44,041
Bitch! What have you done?

576
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,583
- Leave me alone!
- Slut! I'll fucking kill you!

577
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,041
- It wasn't me!
- I'll kill you!

578
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:52,375
I'll fuck you up, you hear me?

579
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:53,916
- It wasn't me!
- You whore!

580
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,166
- Leave me alone!
- I'll kill you!

581
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,250
- I'll kill you!
- It wasn't me!

582
00:50:58,416 --> 00:50:59,750
Leave me alone!

583
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,791
- You killed him!
- Get off me! - I'll fuck you up!

584
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:07,125
- I'll fuck you up, you hear me?
- Jacek, a gentleman to see you.

585
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,750
Jacek.

586
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,958
It's about the screenplay.

587
00:51:16,666 --> 00:51:18,166
It wasn't me!

588
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,416
Who's that woman in the hall?

589
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:31,375
Michałek's mother.

590
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,541
A 4-year-old boy
drowned in the Vistula.

591
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:41,291
She commissioned
her boyfriend to murder her kid.

592
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,458
Cheers.

593
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,250
Cheers.

594
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:04,916
Then, the Lord beheld our work
and was content,

595
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:09,791
but when He asked about our wages,
He sat down and cried.

596
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:14,666
Do you know what they call
the homicide department?

597
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:16,416
A dust factory.

598
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:19,625
We do a lot of good work
that nobody needs.

599
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,333
We're the last romantics.

600
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:29,000
Why romantics?

601
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:37,666
A typical investigator...
from the homicide department

602
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,958
is a divorcee, an alcoholic

603
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,500
with a pet dog

604
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,875
that doesn't fetch.

605
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:47,083
Officially, we don't exist.

606
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,166
Cheers.

607
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:57,041
We have a 95% crime detection rate.
We've solved the biggest cases.

608
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,541
Kredyt Bank. Dębski.

609
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:03,541
But the chief's just decided
our department is redundant,

610
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:08,458
because the number of undetected crimes
in Poland has dropped.

611
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:13,208
So what do you need
for your screenplay?

612
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,875
Nothing.

613
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,250
I wanna make a movie about you.

614
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:40,083
We have a meeting with the Pruszków
gang. Why don't you come with us

615
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,958
- and see what it looks like?
- Won't they mind?

616
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,791
- No.
- You'll pose as one of us.

617
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:47,958
When?

618
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,458
Now. Come.

619
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:01,875
- Have you been long with the homicide?
- 2 months.

620
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:11,083
- Where did you come from?
- Narcotics.

621
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,875
- At Cyril and Methodius.
- Cyril and his methods...

622
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:17,625
They hanged me on a nail there.

623
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,916
Oh... there comes Cieluś.

624
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:25,541
He's too afraid to approach you.

625
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,833
Cieluś offered me
a 3-million-dollar bribe.

626
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,375
- And?
- I knocked 3 of his teeth out.

627
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:44,625
Seen from the side, one can't tell
a difference between you and the bangers.

628
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:49,333
But these are just appearances.
There's a barricade between you.

629
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,208
An invisible line

630
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:55,750
that nobody crosses,
as there's nothing beyond it.

631
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,583
Do you know why you can't be bribed?

632
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,750
Even thugs don't respect a corrupt cop.

633
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,916
And you're afraid of losing your job.

634
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:12,666
For it, you've sacrificed
your health, kids, wives.

635
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:15,833
You have no life without it.

636
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,375
And now you've saved mine.

637
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:20,833
How?

638
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:23,041
I just realized

639
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,750
with you I can legally do

640
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:29,291
extreme things
unattainable to ordinary people.

641
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:34,083
Barnyard banditry will never
give me such a kick.

642
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,125
Overdue alimonies.
You're calculating wages, not benefits.

643
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:44,958
Why the fuck do you need a calculator
with so many zeros? It's decimals...

644
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:55,333
- Have you read it?
- Yes.

645
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,583
What do you think?

646
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:07,750
It's deeper than Pasikowski's "Hounds".

647
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:14,041
- Do you think he could make this movie?
- I think it should be you.

648
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:18,625
No one knows those guys better than you.

649
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:22,166
No one else will understand
what it's about.

650
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,250
But...

651
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:31,958
Will anybody give money... to a director
without a film school diploma?

652
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,208
Well...

653
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,291
it may be a problem.

654
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:40,208
Since you can't make a feature film,
try making a documentary on those guys.

655
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:42,750
And who'll give me money for that?

656
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:47,750
You need to pitch it
to the editor-in-chief of the TVP,

657
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:51,291
Andrzej Fidyk.
A guru in film documentaries.

658
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,916
How can I get to him?

659
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:55,916
I have no idea.

660
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,375
You're a journalist. Figure it out.

661
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,500
A journalist, yes?

662
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,750
Polish Television documentary
department.

663
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:08,958
Hi, PATRYK speaking. I've changed phones
and lost Andrzej's number.

664
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,750
Can you give it to me?

665
00:57:10,875 --> 00:57:12,208
Write it down.

666
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:16,291
- Yes?
- Hello, director.

667
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:19,375
My name's PATRYK Vega.
I'm a reporter.

668
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:23,166
- I have an invitation for you.
- For what?

669
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,125
For vodka.

670
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,416
Will you show your faces?

671
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:29,291
No.

672
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,541
It'd blow our cover.

673
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,416
Anyone will?

674
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,583
See this projectile?

675
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,375
A lucky one.

676
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:41,333
Why?

677
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:46,041
It misfired,
when I tried to blow may brains out.

678
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:50,458
I'm commissioning the whole series.
12 episodes.

679
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:56,500
- Will you let me shoot it?
- There's no way the TVP will agree...

680
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:59,375
to have a series produced
by someone without experience.

681
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:04,541
You'll be an originator and an associate
director, but I must find you a director.

682
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:07,333
Our operations will be
followed by a camera.

683
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,625
Each TV crew member will have a status
of a police assistant.

684
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:13,375
They will act as unarmed police officers.

685
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:17,708
They can take part in all police
operations at their own risk,

686
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:22,666
including interrogations and arrests
made by SWAT officers,

687
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,458
for which we'll equip them
with bulletproof vests.

688
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:40,000
We'll tint the windowpanes and film
with hidden cameras.

689
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,958
- We'll be able to watch them at will.
- How come you have the cheek

690
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:46,458
- to interrupt a cameraman while he's filming?
- Cut him some slack.

691
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,000
And you lost them.

692
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,666
We'll have to stage those scenes.
We'll shoot from several angles.

693
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:58,458
If I can't be a director,
at least give me a camera.

694
00:58:58,625 --> 00:58:59,791
What camera?

695
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,666
A foolproof one. Automatic.
One that I could use by myself.

696
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,250
We've a racketeer that extorts
protection from people in Radom.

697
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:12,958
He calls a fitting dealer and threatens
to rape his daughter, or burn his wife.

698
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:14,375
If he doesn't pay.

699
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:17,625
We're watching the phone booths
in the busiest spots in Radom.

700
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,125
We expect he'll try to blend in,
after he makes a phone call.

701
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:25,666
- We're waiting for our contact, now.
- Pull over. I need to pee.

702
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:57,666
Watching public phones makes no sense.
There's one in the clinic, too.

703
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,916
The guy could easily
make a call from there.

704
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,958
- Nero to Bajbak.
- What is it?

705
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:04,000
We're locating our contact.

706
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,875
- Where's he calling from?
- The clinic at 57A Struga St.

707
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:09,625
Fuck. That's the clinic. Back up.

708
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:27,958
Stop! Police!

709
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:33,500
Stop, or I'll shoot!

710
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,000
Moron!

711
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:53,875
Go, go, go! Go!

712
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:55,625
He went there!

713
01:00:58,208 --> 01:00:59,625
Get the fuck out!

714
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,666
- I'm elated.
- Why?

715
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:20,250
I'm experiencing something unattainable
to 99.9% of the people.

716
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:35,666
There he is! Stop!

717
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,166
Motherfucker!

718
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,458
- Relax. Relax, Ania...
- You fucker!

719
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:47,500
- Calm down, Ania.
- Fascinating. - What again?

720
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:52,125
I'm in my early 20's, but it's only now
that I know I have him in me.

721
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:54,833
- Whom?
- The killer.

722
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,208
It was the brain's chemical reaction.

723
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:02,791
An adrenaline rush that made me
ready to kill that guy.

724
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:08,083
Now I believe a mother can lift a car,
if her child's trapped under it.

725
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:14,000
- Who's that guy?
- His father-in-law's gone missing.

726
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:15,166
A councilor.

727
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:18,916
Divers are searching the local ponds,
to no avail, though.

728
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:23,291
The boys are interrogating the son-in-law.
Perhaps, he knows something.

729
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:25,500
Give me the headphones.

730
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:34,583
I don't know where my father is.
Maybe he's gone away, or has a mistress.

731
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:37,625
That day I was busy playing
with my child.

732
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:41,000
My relationship
with my father-in-law was very good.

733
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:44,458
- We liked each other.
- That's what I'd say.

734
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,375
If I were the killer.

735
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:52,250
I think he killed his father-in-law
and dumped the body.

736
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,583
Pull over here.

737
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,833
We'll be filming the house
with a telephoto lens.

738
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:53,083
Come here.
They've just brought the son-in-law in.

739
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,666
When he saw you with a camera,

740
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:59,041
he went to dig out
his father-in-law's body at night.

741
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,625
Hold it.

742
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:09,166
He moved the barrel with the body
a few kilometers away.

743
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:12,750
The pit was discovered
by mushroom pickers. Here.

744
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:26,041
I like the brain.

745
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:34,333
Hi.

746
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:42,791
Hi.

747
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:48,208
I wanted to see you,
because of my impact on your life.

748
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,875
Because you saw me with a camera,
you'll spend 25 years in prison.

749
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:04,875
It was self-defence.

750
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,458
How?

751
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:10,750
My father-in-law was a beloved
councilor for the villagers.

752
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:12,833
He built roads for them.

753
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:14,333
But at home...

754
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,791
he turned into a monster
who beat up my wife...

755
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:20,208
with a vaccuum cleaner hose.

756
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:23,166
He used to take the toilet seat
to his bedroom...

757
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,625
so that we wouldn't use it up.

758
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:32,250
I was alone with a 1-year-old kid.

759
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:35,625
He attacked me...

760
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,958
because I'd turned on a water boiler.

761
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:42,125
I choked him during the fight,

762
01:05:43,125 --> 01:05:46,000
because he threatened
to kill me and my child.

763
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:49,500
I panicked.

764
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:54,500
I wrapped the body in plastic foil.

765
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:59,458
I dismembered it with an axe
in the garage...

766
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:03,458
put it in a barrel... and hid it.

767
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,833
If you'd reported it, you'd be charged
with involuntary manslaughter.

768
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:18,833
After what you did,

769
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:21,125
you'll go to prison...

770
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,750
for a model...

771
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,750
premeditated murder.

772
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:33,791
Is there anything I can do for you?

773
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:36,041
Can you pass a message to my wife?

774
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,750
Sure.

775
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,750
You can count on me.

776
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:19,625
You fucking scum, you'll rot here
until you die, dig it?

777
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:22,125
Confess to murdering him.

778
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:26,125
Fuck the punk. I'm done talking to him.
It's Christmas Eve.

779
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:31,000
I'm going out to buy my woman a present.
Stay with him until Metyl comes.

780
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,500
Care for a drink?

781
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:14,000
One more?

782
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,625
Tell me, did you whack him?

783
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:28,666
Tell me. Just me.

784
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,666
I won't tell anybody.

785
01:08:32,666 --> 01:08:37,125
It's Christmas Eve.
Consider it a Christmas present for me.

786
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,625
Did you whack him, or not?

787
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:44,000
Just cut the shit and talk to me.

788
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,541
I...

789
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,916
How?

790
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:54,250
I grabbed a knife...

791
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:56,333
while drunk...

792
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,083
We fell out...

793
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,791
I stabbed him...

794
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,458
Horrible.

795
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:30,333
Now they're gonna drag
me to court on Chrismas

796
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,333
to have me testify in your murder case.

797
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:49,791
Opala shot his pregnant
girlfriend while drunk. In the lung.

798
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:52,000
I visited her in the hospital
and convinced her

799
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:55,375
to testify she shot herself
during the argument.

800
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:58,166
Sławek will get a proposition
he can't refuse.

801
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,250
- He'll have to leave the police.
- What'll he do?

802
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:02,833
Kill himself, I guess.

803
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:10,500
A war broke out in the USA. Planes flew
into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon.

804
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:14,791
We don't know what's going on.
There are thousands of casualties.

805
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:17,000
We keep receiving tragic news.

806
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:20,416
"We keep receiving tragic news".
What a dumb-ass!

807
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,875
She shouldn't work for the radio,
if she can't control her emotions.

808
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,583
Whom to believe?

809
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,916
Where's the kid?

810
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:35,125
Where's the fucking kid?

811
01:10:38,666 --> 01:10:39,666
Why?

812
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:43,041
- Do you really have to work on New Year's Eve?
- Yes.

813
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:45,541
- I feel disgusted.
- By what?

814
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,208
The whole human race.

815
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:51,625
Seeing those people
out the window makes me sick.

816
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:55,708
Those morons are shooting firecrackers,
when I'm creating something that'll

817
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:59,500
- change the history of the cinema.
- You need a doctor.

818
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:04,041
My cousin dreamt of making movies,
and now he's shooting porn.

819
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:07,541
Take it, for fuck's sake...

820
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:16,041
THE END

821
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:24,625
I don't want to be a bitter guy mopping
floors in the TV station all his life,

822
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:26,500
knowing he is a genius,

823
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:30,208
but somehow the world ignores
and rejects his ideas.

824
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:34,250
If I fail to make a debut movie
within a year...

825
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:38,291
I'll relinquish my plan
to make movies at all.

826
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:40,083
And what will you be doing?

827
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:43,625
I have a strong need of self-affirmation.

828
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:46,875
I'm seriously considering
becoming a serial killer.

829
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:49,750
- Whom will you kill?
- Bad guys.

830
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,791
In a way I won't get caught.

831
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,666
I'll be constantly changing
my modus operandi.

832
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:03,333
- Me and my multiple personalities are all ears.
- I'm already scared.

833
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,541
You have no film school diploma,
or family connections.

834
01:12:08,416 --> 01:12:12,541
Little chance to get millions for a movie.

835
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:16,416
- So there is a chance?
- Yes.

836
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,875
I've found money for your movie.

837
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:23,833
On condition you turn it
into a 5-episode series as well.

838
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:30,000
No one except me believes in your movie,
and selling the series to the television

839
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:34,833
will allow the ATM company, which puts up
the dough, to make a profit.

840
01:12:39,833 --> 01:12:44,333
I'll remember that day for the rest
of my life. The trip to the set.

841
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,083
Entering it.

842
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:48,541
The first time I'd say "action".

843
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,083
- Eat the sugar.
- It'll stay under my eyelids forever.

844
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,625
Time to finish, dears.
We're gonna shoot.

845
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:04,833
Marek...

846
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:08,916
it's my first time
on the feature film set.

847
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:11,625
Does the director say "camera"?

848
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:15,625
It's usually the set manager, but...
you can do it, too.

849
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,750
Thanks.

850
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,500
Camera!

851
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,375
- Rolling.
- Action!

852
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,750
Have you been drinking?

853
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:33,625
Where's the kid?

854
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,166
What about your A.A. chip?

855
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,875
- Where's the kid?
- You were to stop drinking.

856
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,333
Where's the kid?

857
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,541
Cut!

858
01:13:44,666 --> 01:13:46,750
"Steal it, and I'll shot your knee"?

859
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:50,041
THE FIRST VEGA'S FILM EARNS
$458.000

860
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,833
A message for a thief.

861
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,750
- Is this your ride?
- I bought it in Austria

862
01:13:54,833 --> 01:13:58,541
with the money I made on a movie.
Are we going to the reception?

863
01:13:58,666 --> 01:13:59,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

864
01:13:59,375 --> 01:14:02,333
Will you give me a ride home afterwards?

865
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,583
Why afterwards?

866
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:08,750
Now.

867
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:50,625
How can you come to the set
and provoke me with your erect nipples?

868
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,458
Without a bra?

869
01:14:52,625 --> 01:14:55,583
Have you seen a bra that'd fit my boobs?

870
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:58,083
I must wear sports ones.

871
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:00,666
I like small boobs.

872
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,250
I'm on period.

873
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,416
Gosia...

874
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,083
I've seen 5 autopsies.

875
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:29,500
Whom have you brought to the party?

876
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,833
I just gave here a ride.

877
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,875
I missed you a lot.

878
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:40,791
Let's go to your place.

879
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:46,750
- What happened?
- John Paul II has died.

880
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,375
Let's kneel.

881
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:51,333
- Not good.
- Yes. I loved him so much.

882
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:54,375
Not good, because they'll declare
a national mourning,

883
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:57,250
and the premiere of my movie
will be canceled.

884
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:04,541
The premiere is irrelevant.

885
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:08,416
Something more important has happened.

886
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,208
Yes. More important.

887
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:15,000
Besides, the movie sucks.

888
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:16,458
Why?

889
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,208
Not intellectual enough.

890
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:24,750
There are three things that matter in art:
the truth, the meaning, and...

891
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:26,791
the final message.

892
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,291
There's truth in it.

893
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:34,750
Who cares?

894
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,208
Hi.

895
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:49,541
- We haven't been introduced. PATRYK.
- Hi.

896
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,625
I know who you are...

897
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:57,291
I've been trying to arrange re-shoots
for your City Police series for Friday,

898
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,666
but the spokesman said no.

899
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:03,583
Oh, I'm Kasia.

900
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,916
Want me to help?

901
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:11,833
How?

902
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:16,166
- Who's the City Police spokesman?
- Adam Gradoń.

903
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:19,375
Which precinct are you
trying to get the permit from?

904
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:20,458
Mid-town.

905
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,375
Call their chief,

906
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:29,125
tell him you're Adaś's cousin,
and you have his approval to film,

907
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:33,291
and that he told you to discuss
the details directly with the chief.

908
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:35,916
I can't lie.

909
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,666
Think of it... as some sort of...

910
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,083
adventure.

911
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,500
Yes. Okay.

912
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:08,208
Hello, Kasia Słomińska
from the Pleograf Studio.

913
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:12,625
I'm calling from Adam Gradoń's office.
Can I speak to the chief?

914
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,833
Hello, chief.

915
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:21,083
I'm Adaś's cousin.

916
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:25,291
He gave me his approval to film
in the City Police station.

917
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:26,666
He told me...

918
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:31,583
to discuss the details with you.
The shooting is scheduled...

919
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,041
for Friday, 11 a.m...

920
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:35,833
Yes...

921
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:38,458
Sure, I'll greet Adaś from you.

922
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:40,541
Thanks a million.

923
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,166
- How did you know he'd agree?
- My job's about manipulating people.

924
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:54,916
Is Dziki in?

925
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,250
Yes.

926
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:02,000
You're the third best Polish movie
of the year,

927
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:06,875
but your debut won't yield any profit.
It was viewed by only 150,000 people.

928
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:11,375
No one can predict
what the cinema audience will do.

929
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,791
Americans say that making movies
is second only to building space shuttles

930
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:19,833
- in terms of risk.
- I'll be the first

931
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:22,625
to learn to predict the audience.

932
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:27,166
In making movies it's not enough
to press blue, yellow, or red buttons

933
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:29,791
to produce a million views.

934
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:31,791
We'll see.

935
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:34,375
I made a movie no one cared to see.

936
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,041
Now, I want success.

937
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,375
I'll choose your station's
best-selling actors

938
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:43,958
and I'll make a blockbuster
for many people to see.

939
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:48,625
Okay. Let's do it.

940
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:51,333
Or not.

941
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,541
I'm indisposed.

942
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:59,458
Get me the assistant director here.
Have him shoot for me. I'm going to bed.

943
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:03,750
Wait, wait...
The producer is coming for inspection.

944
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:08,375
Get me the sound guy with a stick.

945
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,916
Krzychu... come, come, come...

946
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,333
Record.

947
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:15,541
Camera!

948
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:18,291
Action!

949
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:21,000
Play it in a loop.
When the producer comes,

950
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:24,625
she'll look for me on the set,
and then she'll leave.

951
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,166
- Where's PATRYK?
- At the buffet.

952
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,000
Camera!

953
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,333
Action!

954
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,583
He's back shooting.

955
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:00,833
Camera!

956
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:02,375
Action!

957
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,125
- He's not here.
- He's with the 2nd unit,

958
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:07,583
- a kilometer away from here.
- Okay.

959
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,875
If he's busy, have him call me
after the shooting.

960
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:12,041
Okay.

961
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:19,250
I bought a 1.5 liter whisky mug.
I don't feel like running to the fridge

962
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,416
- each time.
- Seriously?

963
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:23,875
We're going out.

964
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:27,083
- Where?
- The Old Town.

965
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,166
What? Jaup... jaup...

966
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:46,250
The color of Trzebiatowska's
shoes sucks.

967
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:50,291
She doesn't keep her curls
throuout the scenes.

968
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:48,750
VEGA'S FILMS HAVE MADE
$1,924,000

969
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:50,625
I can't drink anymore.

970
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:53,625
I need to change something
in my life.

971
01:22:54,125 --> 01:22:55,125
And...

972
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:58,041
What're you gonna do?

973
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:01,625
I'll start doing coke
to be able to drink more.

974
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:07,041
Docent I an exclusive celebrities' dealer.
From now on, he's gonna be my supplier.

975
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:09,625
- What's up? How much?
- 10 grams.

976
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:45,916
Kasia, I snorted 10 grams in one night.

977
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:49,208
I snorted 10 grams in one night.
I haven't slept in 3 days.

978
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:52,125
Every time I close my eyes,
my heart stops.

979
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:55,666
I'd jump out the window,
but I live on the first floor.

980
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:56,875
Kasia...

981
01:23:57,041 --> 01:23:58,208
Honey...

982
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:00,208
I love you, you know?

983
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:02,458
But... I don't know...

984
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:05,625
If I come to you now, and...

985
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:10,166
start patting you on your head,
you'll never get out of it.

986
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:27,125
I'm dying, sir.

987
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:32,083
Half of my body is numb.
We must hurry to the hospital.

988
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,500
The readings are good.

989
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:56,541
It's all in your head.

990
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,166
Kasia, I haven't slept in 4 days.
I have agoraphobia.

991
01:25:01,875 --> 01:25:06,625
Now I know why Kurt Cobain was
sitting in a closet before he died.

992
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:15,541
It's not food poisoning, mom.

993
01:25:15,666 --> 01:25:17,750
I've overdosed on cocaine.

994
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:20,375
I haven't slept in 5 days.

995
01:25:22,458 --> 01:25:23,625
Help me.

996
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,416
You've always known
when to bang it out full blast, son.

997
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,000
- What kind of beans have you taken?
- I don't know.

998
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,916
You could've hurt yourself.
Don't do it again.

999
01:25:33,083 --> 01:25:36,625
We'll give you something
to knock you out for 8 hours.

1000
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,625
Stay with me.

1001
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,500
See if I keep breathing.

1002
01:25:56,125 --> 01:25:58,083
How long have I slept?

1003
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:00,916
30 minutes.

1004
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:03,333
Give me another one.

1005
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:29,958
How long?

1006
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:33,125
3 hours.

1007
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:44,541
Get me a third one.

1008
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,125
2012

1009
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:09,875
I filed for the annulment
of my marriage, but...

1010
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,041
Until I get it,

1011
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:15,041
I can't receive Communion,
and it's...

1012
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,458
very hard for me.

1013
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:22,625
I'm finished as a director.

1014
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:25,166
I don't know what to do in life.

1015
01:27:25,333 --> 01:27:26,958
What was all that for?

1016
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:30,583
There's a streak of failures behind me.

1017
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:35,291
I don't think anyone will ever
lay out money for my movie.

1018
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:39,041
So many years and nothing's changed.
I feel the same.

1019
01:27:39,208 --> 01:27:41,875
- Feel what?
- Disdain for people.

1020
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:50,291
They make me feel like an alien
born on a wrong planet.

1021
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:52,833
I know I'll never...

1022
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,250
understand them,
and they won't understand me.

1023
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,416
A service is starting...

1024
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:04,416
Perhaps you'd like to go
to the church with me?

1025
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,041
Go alone.

1026
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:11,125
You'll figure something out, honey.

1027
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:12,958
I'm sure.

1028
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:16,601
VEGA'S FILMS HAVE MADE
$4,102,000

1029
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:17,958
Bye.

1030
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:26,125
PATRYK?

1031
01:28:27,208 --> 01:28:28,375
What's up?

1032
01:28:28,541 --> 01:28:31,750
I'm Niesiołowski's assistant,
that MP.

1033
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:37,625
There's a lady that advises politicians.
She reads people and predicts the future.

1034
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,958
Crap.

1035
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:42,500
Niesiołowski owed one guy a million.

1036
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,666
He asked Aniela what he should do.

1037
01:28:45,833 --> 01:28:49,750
She told him not to do anything,
'cause the guy'd vanish into thin air.

1038
01:28:49,916 --> 01:28:52,750
And a week later he got killed
in Smoleńsk.

1039
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:57,416
There's something foul about that woman.
Her life is a streak of misfortunes.

1040
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,916
Both her sons are sick. Her dog is sick.

1041
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:05,125
When a helicopter crashed outside
Katowice, it crashed into her balcony.

1042
01:29:05,291 --> 01:29:07,333
When there was a fire in a factory,

1043
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:11,000
all her paperwork burnt,
so she can't get her pension.

1044
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:12,791
You've convinced me.

1045
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:16,250
- How can I get hold of her?
- By phone only.

1046
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:20,750
Hello, Aniela, PATRYK speaking.
I got your number from Mateusz.

1047
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:22,166
Hello.

1048
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,000
- I'm a film director, and...
- Uh huh...

1049
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:31,083
I don't know what to do in life. The film
I made turned out to be a failure.

1050
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,375
Yet another one in my life.

1051
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:36,625
I feel like I'm finished.

1052
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:39,916
I don't know...
Shall I change my profession?

1053
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:44,750
Egypt will soon shut off. Tourists
will no longer visit the pyramids.

1054
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:48,541
That movie was a gate.
Had you not made it,

1055
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:51,416
your life would've taken
a different course.

1056
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,958
But now you'll achieve success.

1057
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:57,083
I can see crowds coming
to see your movie.

1058
01:29:58,125 --> 01:30:01,875
- What's the movie gonna be about?
- There'll be many movies.

1059
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,208
The one to attract crowds?

1060
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:09,208
You'll make a movie about wicked women.
It'll fill up the theaters.

1061
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:13,958
Then you'll make one about doctors.
I can see crowds there too.

1062
01:30:15,083 --> 01:30:16,625
Why you?

1063
01:30:17,833 --> 01:30:20,375
My sweetest one...

1064
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,291
No...

1065
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:25,458
No...

1066
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:29,583
Florian's been paralyzed.

1067
01:30:31,916 --> 01:30:32,916
How?

1068
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:34,541
I don't know...

1069
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:38,958
He started walking sideways.
First, his hind legs gave in...

1070
01:30:39,125 --> 01:30:43,250
Then, the front ones.
Now, he doesn't move at all.

1071
01:30:47,458 --> 01:30:48,625
Help him...

1072
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:54,583
My... my love...

1073
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,625
Help him.

1074
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:12,375
I don't know what it is. A neurological
problem, perhaps. Or a spine trauma.

1075
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:16,125
Maybe his spinal cord is damaged.
He has to be rolled over

1076
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:19,625
from side to side, every hour,
so his lungs don't collapse.

1077
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:23,583
- Okay.
- And do air cycling with him for an hour

1078
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:28,750
to prevent his muscles from declining,
which happens very fast.

1079
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:31,625
- For how long?
- I don't know...

1080
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:36,000
People put dogs like that down,
because they can't manage.

1081
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,375
Is medicine helpless?

1082
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,333
Conventional, yes.

1083
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:45,625
But I know a woman who helps
animals in this condition.

1084
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:48,000
She used to have cancer herself.

1085
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:52,666
She was granted a gift that helped
her recover. Now she heals herself.

1086
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:00,833
I'll get a CD with a pep
program for Florian.

1087
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,750
It'll heal him.

1088
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:08,125
You are surrounded by space doctors.

1089
01:32:09,541 --> 01:32:12,916
Fulgent figures approach you.

1090
01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:19,750
They lay their hands on you.

1091
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:24,208
They begin to heal
all your neural connections...

1092
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,791
Can you feel the cosmic energy
pass through you?

1093
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:30,041
Yes, Magda. Thanks a lot.

1094
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:32,625
- Hi.
- Hello...

1095
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:37,291
I've been carrying him for 4 hours.
He can't pee, hasn't pooped for 14 days.

1096
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:41,541
Magda told me a medium from the U.S.A.
will come to Poland.

1097
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:43,500
Worked as a PhD for NASA,

1098
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:47,625
then she went through a transformation
by the healer John of God in Brazil.

1099
01:32:47,791 --> 01:32:49,875
I'll see her about my spine.

1100
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,625
I can't move.

1101
01:33:33,916 --> 01:33:36,208
2013

1102
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:44,583
Come on, let's dance.

1103
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:06,916
This is the highest card
as regards finances.

1104
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:10,083
In that time you'll make a fortune.

1105
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:14,875
The ghosts said you should
hang it up in your bedroom.

1106
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,833
They will protect you.

1107
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,083
This is an old Jewish method
from kabbalach.

1108
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:23,500
Write the name of your enemy
on a piece of paper.

1109
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:25,166
Put him in tinfoil.

1110
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,791
Give him food.

1111
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,875
Wrap him up.

1112
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:32,833
And freeze him in a freezer.

1113
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,208
This way

1114
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:36,250
you'll cut yourself off

1115
01:34:36,416 --> 01:34:39,041
from all your enemies.

1116
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,750
What are you doing?

1117
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:04,333
- Don't touch it. It's very important.
- Okay...

1118
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:09,583
I just want to tell you...
Tomorrow at 10 I'm going to my parents.

1119
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:12,083
For Easter.

1120
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:23,458
- Yes?
- Hello, Aniela.

1121
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:26,875
PATRYK speaking.
Have you been able to foresee

1122
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:29,791
whether I should go on vacation this year?

1123
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:32,541
Yes, but I can see
you'll have an accident.

1124
01:35:32,625 --> 01:35:36,125
- What accident?
- You'll be riding in a black car.

1125
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:38,625
I can see a bend
in a road through a forest.

1126
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:41,625
There will be three males
in an oncoming car.

1127
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:45,375
Good I've put on
a loose sweatsuit for the road.

1128
01:35:45,541 --> 01:35:47,750
You've taken a different route.

1129
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:51,541
A shortcut through the back country.
We'll skip the traffic.

1130
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:18,458
Dad?

1131
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:19,625
Dad!?

1132
01:36:20,416 --> 01:36:21,416
Dad!?

1133
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,583
You killed my father!

1134
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:28,083
Fuck... I was supposed to go...

1135
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:30,958
to Radom and have some
Easter poppyseed cake...

1136
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:33,291
but it won't happen...

1137
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:38,083
My life's just ended.
I killed a man and I'm going to jail.

1138
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:39,750
No...

1139
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:42,500
You know what I felt?

1140
01:36:42,875 --> 01:36:44,083
Your spine?

1141
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:47,125
I'll never be safe without God.

1142
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,625
I can...

1143
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,916
secure myself, hoard the riches.

1144
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:55,000
But one second's enough to lose it all.

1145
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:58,083
Kamil!

1146
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,041
Father's alive!

1147
01:37:00,208 --> 01:37:02,208
- Dad!
- He passed out.

1148
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:03,375
Dad!

1149
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,625
I don't know, mom!

1150
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:19,000
Some chav.

1151
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,250
A common bald chav.

1152
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:23,250
Yes.

1153
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:29,750
The Volvo has broken in half. The pedals
are gone. It's a miracle nobody got hurt.

1154
01:37:29,916 --> 01:37:33,000
Let's go to church to say our thanks.

1155
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:36,416
- How?
- The firefighters will give us a ride.

1156
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:03,458
I want to sign up for exorcisms.

1157
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,125
First, you must see a psychologist.
If you get qualified,

1158
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:12,000
you'll speak to Father Grewkowicz,
who'll decide what'll happen next.

1159
01:38:13,916 --> 01:38:15,416
What is it about?

1160
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:17,625
Suddenly, I felt safe.

1161
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:23,916
So far, I've been like a house
with a deactivated alarm system.

1162
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,750
With doors and windows opened wide.

1163
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:29,666
I let everything inside.

1164
01:38:31,166 --> 01:38:33,375
I stopped thinking on my own.

1165
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:37,916
I consulted everything with a seer.

1166
01:38:39,041 --> 01:38:42,666
Each petty thing
related to my existence.

1167
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:48,208
Over the last 3 years,
I've opened myself to bad energy.

1168
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:52,625
I think it revealed itself
through a head-on collision

1169
01:38:52,791 --> 01:38:56,458
- that God saved me from.
- Tell me about it step by step.

1170
01:38:56,625 --> 01:39:00,416
People like that may be convinced
they're pure love.

1171
01:39:00,583 --> 01:39:04,333
But they never know
who advises them from the other side.

1172
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,083
It is not God. He doesn't act this way.

1173
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:12,666
If God wanted us
to know the future, He'd show it to us.

1174
01:39:15,625 --> 01:39:17,875
It always works the same way.

1175
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:22,000
You get pieces of true information,
fall for it...

1176
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,166
and follow it blindly.

1177
01:39:24,583 --> 01:39:28,833
Then, you start rolling down
a steep slope towards destruction.

1178
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,291
That's what the evil spirit wants.

1179
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:37,708
What you've experienced might've been
a result of strong mental suggestion.

1180
01:39:37,791 --> 01:39:40,708
But if it resulted from spiritual
interference...

1181
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:43,208
you won't cope with it on your own.

1182
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:48,416
Holy Spirit, come...

1183
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:52,458
And open my heart...

1184
01:39:55,416 --> 01:39:58,625
Holy Spirit, come...

1185
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:04,000
And fill my heart with your love.

1186
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,791
Holy Spirit... Your breath

1187
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:14,166
has the power to transform me.

1188
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:17,791
You must sever all contacts
with those people.

1189
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:19,625
And attend the CRR.

1190
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:23,333
- What's that?
- Charismatic Renewal Retreat.

1191
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,875
I'm no good for that. I don't function
well in a group. I can't stand bigots.

1192
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:31,166
The exorcisms have lit a fire in you...

1193
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:33,333
But if you neglect it...

1194
01:40:33,791 --> 01:40:35,500
it will die out.

1195
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:47,958
During today's liturgy, we shall pray
for the charismatic healing.

1196
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,416
Let each of you

1197
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:53,166
pray to the Holy Spirit
for whatever you want.

1198
01:40:53,666 --> 01:40:55,416
Come, Holy Spirit.

1199
01:40:55,583 --> 01:40:58,583
Please, come to us and heal us.

1200
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:01,125
Come, Holy Spirit.

1201
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,750
I'm sorry, but I can't believe in this.

1202
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:06,500
I have too many reservations.

1203
01:41:06,625 --> 01:41:09,666
I can't believe
you'll suddenly visit me, Holy Spirit,

1204
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:12,583
and heal my spine injured in the crash.

1205
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:17,583
As a human being, I have too many
limitations that tell me it won't happen.

1206
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:21,000
You know that we are sinful,
you know that we stumble,

1207
01:41:21,166 --> 01:41:24,583
but in spite of that, all the time
we count on your help,

1208
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:27,375
- we count on your support...
- Okay...

1209
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:31,041
I'll switch off my sober mind
for a moment.

1210
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:37,291
I'll reject my prejudices and believe
that you can come and heal my neck.

1211
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:46,125
It's the middle of summer
but it's freezing in this church.

1212
01:41:54,958 --> 01:41:57,250
- He moved.
- Are you sure?

1213
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:00,250
I wasn't at the beginning,
but look.

1214
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:08,166
- I see you got a new dog.
- No, it's the same one.

1215
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:09,041
Come.

1216
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,833
I have understood that...

1217
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,750
I won't have to believe
in God ever again.

1218
01:42:14,916 --> 01:42:16,250
I just know

1219
01:42:16,416 --> 01:42:18,083
He's out there.

1220
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:23,375
I could feel a physical force
adjust my cervical verterbrae, and...

1221
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:26,000
the church turned into a freezer.

1222
01:42:27,375 --> 01:42:28,500
Honey...

1223
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:33,500
it's hard to listen to things one has not
experienced themselves, but...

1224
01:42:33,625 --> 01:42:36,500
I'm so happy you're no longer hurting...

1225
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:43,333
that I let you have a drink tonight.

1226
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:45,750
I... will never...

1227
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,250
- drink again.
- You won't?

1228
01:42:50,083 --> 01:42:53,750
God let me take an elevator ride
to a different level.

1229
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:57,625
I'll quit drinking...

1230
01:42:57,916 --> 01:43:00,166
smoking... I'll lose weight.

1231
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:02,541
I'll eat regularly.

1232
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:03,666
Huh...

1233
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:07,833
And you know what else?

1234
01:43:08,833 --> 01:43:10,750
I have never...

1235
01:43:10,875 --> 01:43:12,500
thought I will...

1236
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:14,625
talk shit to a stranger...

1237
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:21,083
through a lattice. But now, after 20 years
I'll go to confession again.

1238
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,250
I can't absolve you.

1239
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:28,625
A civil divorce is irrelevant.

1240
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:36,666
You're living with a woman... whom God
still considers another man's wife.

1241
01:43:37,958 --> 01:43:39,125
So...

1242
01:43:39,291 --> 01:43:42,625
I'll never be allowed
to receive Communion?

1243
01:43:43,583 --> 01:43:49,500
The only solution is to have
the marriage invalidated by the Church.

1244
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:54,250
My wife's been trying
to accomplish that for 7 years.

1245
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:15,541
2016

1246
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:20,458
Gosia used to work with me in a hospital.
I want to remain anonymous.

1247
01:44:20,625 --> 01:44:22,125
Sure.

1248
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:24,340
I'll let you see the movie
before I release it.

1249
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:25,684
VEGA'S FILMS HAVE MADE
$52,000,000

1250
01:44:25,708 --> 01:44:27,833
What did you do specifically?

1251
01:44:28,166 --> 01:44:31,166
I performed 976 abortions.

1252
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:38,875
When I got pregnant, I was afraid
I'd be punished with a sick child.

1253
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:42,083
I promised myself not to ever do it again.

1254
01:44:44,333 --> 01:44:46,666
What does abortion look like?

1255
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:50,500
Is the child being scraped out?

1256
01:44:50,625 --> 01:44:55,458
The woman gets an abortion pill,
and she gives birth to a child.

1257
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:58,583
And...

1258
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:01,083
What happens with the child?

1259
01:45:02,916 --> 01:45:08,125
It's taken out to a different room
in a bowl and placed on a windowsill.

1260
01:45:10,541 --> 01:45:11,750
Alive?

1261
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:15,750
Yes.

1262
01:45:16,291 --> 01:45:20,041
It's left there
without food or drink until it dies.

1263
01:45:23,083 --> 01:45:24,791
How long does it take?

1264
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:31,833
The record-breaker took over ten hours.

1265
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,958
Okay, 15-minute break.
Then we'll go back to scene 127.

1266
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,125
PATRYK...

1267
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,666
I can't do this movie.

1268
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,500
Why?

1269
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:46,625
My parents are doctors,
and this screenplay is... gruesome.

1270
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:49,833
But... it's based on doctors' accounts.

1271
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,291
Yes, but... it discredits the entire
healthcare system.

1272
01:45:53,458 --> 01:45:56,250
- I can't do that to them.
- PATRYK...

1273
01:45:56,416 --> 01:46:00,333
Eleven actors refused to act in your film.
Are you sure you want to do it?

1274
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:04,166
You're the best-selling director.
This may ruin you.

1275
01:46:04,333 --> 01:46:06,500
I am confused, Jesus.

1276
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:08,916
I don't know what to do.

1277
01:46:10,291 --> 01:46:11,791
Everyone tells me

1278
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,333
to quit making this movie.

1279
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:15,875
I'm begging you.

1280
01:46:17,291 --> 01:46:19,125
Tell me what you want.

1281
01:46:19,666 --> 01:46:21,666
You are the Lord of life.

1282
01:46:22,416 --> 01:46:25,625
You are the Lord
of the beginning and the end

1283
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:27,541
of every man's life.

1284
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:31,250
I'm giving you all those praying here.

1285
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:34,916
My Lord, I'm giving you
those who are close

1286
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:37,375
and those far away.

1287
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:40,750
I'm giving you those who love you

1288
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:44,458
and those who still don't love you enough.

1289
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:49,375
I'm giving you those who believe
and do not believe in you.

1290
01:46:49,666 --> 01:46:52,625
I'm giving you all those
who live in sin.

1291
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:54,041
SAVE A BABY'S LIFE

1292
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:56,833
And those blessed with your grace.

1293
01:46:57,250 --> 01:47:00,333
I'm giving you my brothers and sisters.

1294
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:04,750
I'm giving you all those
whose lives you crave.

1295
01:47:05,041 --> 01:47:09,416
Okay, Jesus... I'll make this movie
in the teeth of everything.

1296
01:47:09,583 --> 01:47:14,125
Vanquish death and give them new life.

1297
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:42,583
That picture will burn
a hole in people's brains.

1298
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,875
Father Waldemar Maliszewski.

1299
01:47:45,041 --> 01:47:47,000
I am a police chaplain.

1300
01:47:47,333 --> 01:47:48,750
We met on the set.

1301
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:52,500
- I married actors in your movie.
- Oh...

1302
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:54,375
I remember.

1303
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:56,250
God bless you.

1304
01:47:56,416 --> 01:47:58,625
Hell broke loose on the Net.

1305
01:47:58,916 --> 01:48:01,875
Pro-abortionists' hate is paramount.

1306
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:04,541
The opening box office will be low.

1307
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:09,583
Come on, honey. I don't think so.
When will the box office results come in?

1308
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:15,333
Speak.

1309
01:48:19,916 --> 01:48:21,125
Thanks.

1310
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:22,875
- And?
- 711,000 viewers over the first weekend.

1311
01:48:22,958 --> 01:48:26,375
VEGA'S FILMS HAVE MADE
$77,000,000

1312
01:48:27,625 --> 01:48:30,916
- What? - The best opening of the year!
- Awesome.

1313
01:48:31,083 --> 01:48:32,458
Wait.

1314
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:34,791
Yes?

1315
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,583
Really?

1316
01:48:42,125 --> 01:48:43,750
Yes... Sure.

1317
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:45,083
Okay.

1318
01:48:46,083 --> 01:48:47,250
Bye.

1319
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:54,125
You'll never guess.

1320
01:48:58,583 --> 01:49:01,458
My church marriage has been annulled.

1321
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,458
We can get married in church.

1322
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:11,041
What a day!

1323
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:16,125
Now that you want to enter
into sacramental marriage,

1324
01:49:16,291 --> 01:49:18,500
hold each other's right hands.

1325
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:22,083
Before God and the Church,

1326
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:26,791
repeat after me
the words of the marital vows.

1327
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:30,041
- I, PATRYK...
- I, PATRYK...

1328
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:34,458
- take you, Katarzyna, to be my wife...
- take you, Katarzyna, to be my wife...

1329
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:36,250
and I promise...

1330
01:49:36,416 --> 01:49:37,750
to love you,

1331
01:49:37,916 --> 01:49:39,250
to be faithful to you,

1332
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:42,666
to be your honest husband...

1333
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:46,250
and to remain by your side...

1334
01:49:46,416 --> 01:49:48,250
till death do us part.

1335
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:50,625
So help me...

1336
01:49:50,791 --> 01:49:52,500
Almighty God

1337
01:49:52,625 --> 01:49:54,000
A mighty God

1338
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:56,333
in the name of the Trinity...

1339
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,958
and the Holy Saints.

1340
01:50:02,083 --> 01:50:05,833
If I'd gotten it earlier,
I wouldn't have appreciated it.

1341
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,250
Communion?

1342
01:50:09,625 --> 01:50:13,625
God granted me that only
after I had matured in faith.

1343
01:50:16,625 --> 01:50:19,458
- Body and Blood of Christ.
- Amen.

1344
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:25,291
- Body and Blood of Christ.
- Amen.

1345
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:33,625
Do you know the pain
of losing such a small child?

1346
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:37,583
This woman has recorded a message
for the kidnapper of her child.

1347
01:50:37,666 --> 01:50:39,208
I want to meet her.

1348
01:50:39,291 --> 01:50:43,000
Do you know the infinite fear
and despair of not knowing his fate?

1349
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:44,458
There are...

1350
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:47,375
two types of parents.

1351
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,625
One, like my husband,

1352
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:54,750
who respond to their child's
kidnapping by saying... "Too bad...

1353
01:50:54,875 --> 01:50:58,791
What's done is done...
Gotta move on with your life."

1354
01:51:00,375 --> 01:51:02,250
And the other, like me,

1355
01:51:02,375 --> 01:51:06,500
who keep searching for their child
even 20 years later.

1356
01:51:07,875 --> 01:51:10,083
How have you coped with it?

1357
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:14,583
I've known I must be strong for him.

1358
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,250
Because if he's found,
he will need me.

1359
01:51:32,375 --> 01:51:34,125
It's just like...

1360
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:38,333
trying to take a bone away
from a rabid dog.

1361
01:51:39,375 --> 01:51:41,833
It has to end with painful bites.

1362
01:51:42,916 --> 01:51:45,250
Are you ready to make this movie,

1363
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,125
and lose everything?

1364
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:51,041
What do you mean by "everything"?

1365
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:56,083
Your family, your wife, your kids,
your house... money, your career?

1366
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,541
You're exaggerating.

1367
01:51:58,666 --> 01:51:59,666
Camera!

1368
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Action!

1369
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:21,250
Cut?

1370
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:25,333
- Cut. Who's that?
- I don't know, but that's our prop car.

1371
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,500
Cut.

1372
01:52:26,541 --> 01:52:29,791
There are attractive women
who don't look good in the camera,

1373
01:52:29,958 --> 01:52:32,875
and average ones
that the camera tweaks 1,000%...

1374
01:52:33,041 --> 01:52:35,333
But the camera loves you.

1375
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:40,375
You could have a career.
My name is Vega. PATRYK Vega.

1376
01:52:40,750 --> 01:52:44,750
- You look taller in the pictures.
- I have a good sense of humor.

1377
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:48,250
164 IQ, and... I'm a millionaire.

1378
01:52:48,791 --> 01:52:52,375
If I were taller,
it'd be unfair to other men.

1379
01:52:54,041 --> 01:52:55,791
Come to an audition.

1380
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:57,958
Give me your number.

1381
01:52:58,958 --> 01:53:00,166
Incredible.

1382
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:04,750
- What?
- I wasn't even supposed to be here.

1383
01:53:04,916 --> 01:53:10,291
I've come for a moment to deliver
the car for my father, who's just fainted.

1384
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:32,458
Is it a wrap?

1385
01:53:32,666 --> 01:53:34,291
Off to the hotel.

1386
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:17,750
If you send this message,

1387
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:20,375
I won't be able to help you.

1388
01:54:21,916 --> 01:54:23,041
Duh...

1389
01:55:32,041 --> 01:55:35,250
I'd like to invest
in a residential complex in the US.

1390
01:55:35,416 --> 01:55:39,833
- Find me some nice apartments.
- Sure, brother. Great decision.

1391
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,291
America is the land of smiling people.
I spoke to the diamond Jew.

1392
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:47,041
He can get you a diamond crown.

1393
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:50,750
You could wear it for the premiere
of your new movie.

1394
01:55:50,916 --> 01:55:52,666
God is begging you

1395
01:55:52,958 --> 01:55:56,500
to stop engaging
in the futile deeds of the dark.

1396
01:55:57,541 --> 01:56:00,250
During the Eucharist, it came to me

1397
01:56:00,416 --> 01:56:03,250
you should not make your new movie.

1398
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:06,541
Our Lord doesn't want it
to be made.

1399
01:56:06,666 --> 01:56:09,500
I will have a record number of views.

1400
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:13,583
If the Lord does not build the house,

1401
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:15,750
the work of the builders

1402
01:56:15,875 --> 01:56:17,375
is useless.

1403
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:21,041
Prosperity comes from God.

1404
01:56:21,833 --> 01:56:26,875
Nothing gets more stupid
than refusing to fulfil our Lord's will.

1405
01:56:28,416 --> 01:56:31,500
I'm not gonna back out
of making that movie.

1406
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:47,500
DIRECTED BY PATRYK VEGA

1407
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:53,416
VEGA'S FILMS HAVE MADE
$91,000,000

1408
01:57:01,125 --> 01:57:03,583
I've never had such bad reviews.

1409
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:06,750
Box office results coming in.

1410
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:09,500
Speak.

1411
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:17,333
The movie has been a disaster.

1412
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:19,833
Unbelievable.

1413
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,666
Considering all the pressure
to get it done,

1414
01:57:23,833 --> 01:57:25,750
I would've bet my head on it.

1415
01:57:25,833 --> 01:57:27,916
My last penny.

1416
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:32,625
As if... someone has built
an invisible wall to block it out.

1417
01:57:32,791 --> 01:57:34,125
Come with me.

1418
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:36,666
Leave the phone.

1419
01:57:42,333 --> 01:57:44,375
- It's tapped.
- What?

1420
01:57:44,458 --> 01:57:47,250
You've taken up
a slippery topic in this movie.

1421
01:57:49,791 --> 01:57:52,208
- They're eavesdropping on my conversations.
- I know.

1422
01:57:52,291 --> 01:57:55,458
- But why?
- They wanna lock you up.

1423
01:57:55,625 --> 01:57:59,958
I'll set you up with someone
who'll tell you what's going on.

1424
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:03,958
You're not recording, are you?

1425
01:58:05,375 --> 01:58:07,666
Is my phone really tapped?

1426
01:58:08,375 --> 01:58:10,541
You've got bugs everywhere.

1427
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:12,750
What do you mean?

1428
01:58:13,041 --> 01:58:15,333
In your cars, in the house...

1429
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:19,500
They want to set your wife up
with a stud

1430
01:58:19,583 --> 01:58:22,541
who'd sway her to testify against you.

1431
01:58:40,666 --> 01:58:41,750
Honey...

1432
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:45,083
your biggest enemy is your mind.

1433
01:58:49,166 --> 01:58:51,166
THEY CAN HEAR US

1434
01:59:22,625 --> 01:59:26,416
I'm not going to save myself
for myself, Jesus...

1435
01:59:27,458 --> 01:59:30,083
But for you, I can do it...

1436
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,083
Stop it...

1437
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,833
I'm so ashamed to be here...

1438
02:00:12,375 --> 02:00:13,833
I'm sorry...

1439
02:00:16,458 --> 02:00:18,583
I'm sorry, my Lord...

1440
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:47,750
Deliver me...

1441
02:00:51,875 --> 02:00:55,250
When will you transfer the money
for the apartments?

1442
02:00:55,416 --> 02:00:58,625
Right away.

1443
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,416
- Jacek Masalski is here to see you.
- Did he have an appointment?

1444
02:01:15,583 --> 02:01:17,541
No, but it's important.

1445
02:01:19,875 --> 02:01:21,166
Let him in.

1446
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:26,750
Hi.

1447
02:01:28,916 --> 02:01:31,583
You're doing business
with a guy from the States?

1448
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,791
Why?

1449
02:01:32,958 --> 02:01:36,125
I've heard you're gonna lose that money.

1450
02:01:36,833 --> 02:01:41,250
You want to buy a residential complex
for your kids there. He's a thief.

1451
02:01:41,416 --> 02:01:45,833
He's gonna rob you. It's a bogus
transaction. And so is the lawyer.

1452
02:01:46,375 --> 02:01:48,666
I know... the amount...

1453
02:01:49,291 --> 02:01:50,875
you'll lose.

1454
02:01:53,166 --> 02:01:54,458
Correct?

1455
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,583
That guy has ties
to the old Pruszków gang.

1456
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:02,291
He's been a professional con-artist
for 30 years.

1457
02:02:02,458 --> 02:02:05,958
A whole team are working on you.
And he is...

1458
02:02:06,125 --> 02:02:09,250
- grooming you for 3 years.
- Grooming?

1459
02:02:11,125 --> 02:02:12,958
Feeding the victim.

1460
02:02:13,125 --> 02:02:15,875
He's softening you
with watches, diamonds...

1461
02:02:16,041 --> 02:02:18,625
cars, which he uses to rip you off.

1462
02:02:19,458 --> 02:02:21,416
For a sole purpose...

1463
02:02:21,666 --> 02:02:25,125
of eventually robbing you
of everything you have.

1464
02:02:25,791 --> 02:02:29,166
- Do you know how they're gonna do it?
- Uh-huh.

1465
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:31,125
You'll buy the estate.

1466
02:02:31,291 --> 02:02:35,333
Then, they'll tell you
something's gone wrong.

1467
02:02:35,875 --> 02:02:39,458
And you have to pay a little extra.
So you will.

1468
02:02:39,833 --> 02:02:44,500
Then, they'll tell you to pay
a little more to make it awesome.

1469
02:02:44,625 --> 02:02:45,833
Yes...

1470
02:02:46,833 --> 02:02:50,291
And then, they'll rob you
of fucking everything.

1471
02:02:53,583 --> 02:02:57,416
I knew a guy from So pot
whom they conned out of 30 rocks.

1472
02:02:57,583 --> 02:02:59,625
He never got over it.

1473
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,750
He went back to his 5,000-zloty salary.

1474
02:03:03,916 --> 02:03:05,125
Finally...

1475
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,916
he committed suicide.

1476
02:03:11,166 --> 02:03:12,666
See you later.

1477
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:14,333
Jacek...

1478
02:03:17,666 --> 02:03:18,791
thanks.

1479
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,458
There'll be no transfer.
I know you want to rob me.

1480
02:03:37,541 --> 02:03:39,291
You've put so much effort into it,

1481
02:03:39,458 --> 02:03:42,541
and now you have to kiss
your money goodbye. Poor thing.

1482
02:03:43,875 --> 02:03:46,333
How much longer will it take?

1483
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:14,500
Clean.

1484
02:04:14,625 --> 02:04:15,833
How clean?

1485
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Your house, your car. Both clean.
Whoever told you you were tapped

1486
02:04:20,166 --> 02:04:21,750
was full of shit.

1487
02:04:26,083 --> 02:04:28,750
Old mistakes - no.
New ones - yes.

1488
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,375
I'm sure I have many more to make.

1489
02:04:32,833 --> 02:04:34,583
But I'll never allow...

1490
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,750
the evil one...
to sneak up on me again.

1491
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:48,625
I want to ask you...
to renew our marital vows to Jesus.

1492
02:04:49,833 --> 02:04:52,541
I can feel it's important for us.

1493
02:05:05,416 --> 02:05:07,250
Dear spouses,

1494
02:05:07,833 --> 02:05:09,125
3 years ago,

1495
02:05:09,291 --> 02:05:12,625
you entered into sacramental
marriage before God,

1496
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:14,750
tying a bond in Jesus Christ

1497
02:05:14,916 --> 02:05:16,666
for your entire life.

1498
02:05:16,833 --> 02:05:19,291
Then, you vowed to love each other,

1499
02:05:19,458 --> 02:05:20,833
remain faithful,

1500
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,625
cherish each other,

1501
02:05:22,958 --> 02:05:27,458
and persevere in the marital bond
till you're parted by death.

1502
02:05:27,625 --> 02:05:32,291
As a sign of your will to fulfil your holy
obligations even better,

1503
02:05:32,833 --> 02:05:35,041
hold each other's right hands,

1504
02:05:35,375 --> 02:05:39,875
and answer the questions that I will ask
you on behalf of the Church.

1505
02:05:42,916 --> 02:05:44,291
You know,

1506
02:05:44,458 --> 02:05:47,541
I was in a grave.
They almost buried me.

1507
02:05:48,125 --> 02:05:50,625
God saved from demise once again.

1508
02:05:52,583 --> 02:05:56,750
- I thought God would punish me for that.
- God never punishes us.

1509
02:05:56,916 --> 02:05:58,916
He lets us bathe in His mercy.

1510
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,500
He's waiting for us with open arms.

1511
02:06:02,625 --> 02:06:04,666
But the first step is on us.

1512
02:06:05,958 --> 02:06:07,791
Because we are not puppets.

1513
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,791
And God gave us free will.

1514
02:06:10,916 --> 02:06:13,458
So far, I've been behind the wheel
in my life.

1515
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:14,875
VEGA'S FILMS HAVE MADE
$112,000,000

1516
02:06:14,916 --> 02:06:17,125
I looked at God only when I needed Him.

1517
02:06:18,041 --> 02:06:20,625
Now, I'm handing the wheel to Him.

1518
02:06:22,041 --> 02:06:25,375
I want to work for Him,
not for myself.

1519
02:06:26,083 --> 02:06:30,666
Do you think God wants me to stop being a
movie director and do it in a different way?

1520
02:06:31,083 --> 02:06:35,000
Listen to yourself.
And answer this question yourself.

1521
02:06:35,166 --> 02:06:38,041
You've wanted to be a director
since you were a child.

1522
02:06:38,250 --> 02:06:40,166
Who gave you that dream?

1523
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:42,958
Who put it in your heart?

1524
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:46,125
Who made you a movie director?

1525
02:06:46,291 --> 02:06:49,625
Who prompts you the content
of your screenplays,

1526
02:06:49,750 --> 02:06:53,958
when you're praying for anointment?
Who made it all work in your heart?

1527
02:06:54,125 --> 02:06:57,541
Put it together?
And made you a craftsman?

1528
02:07:00,250 --> 02:07:03,458
I'll never be able to tell the story
of God's masterpiece here in Poland.

1529
02:07:03,541 --> 02:07:06,333
It's impossible due to the market
and budget limitations.

1530
02:07:06,416 --> 02:07:11,291
You know, the only bird that dares
to attack an eagle... is a raven.

1531
02:07:12,916 --> 02:07:16,458
It sits on it and pecks.
And what does the eagle does?

1532
02:07:16,625 --> 02:07:19,791
- Uh-huh?
- It doesn't fight back, or fly away.

1533
02:07:19,958 --> 02:07:22,541
It just rises higher and higher.

1534
02:07:22,666 --> 02:07:25,000
And finally the raven gives up,

1535
02:07:25,166 --> 02:07:28,750
because it sees the altitude
is way too high for it.

1536
02:07:28,916 --> 02:07:30,666
Can you hear me?

1537
02:07:31,375 --> 02:07:34,000
Slow down, and soar higher.

1538
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:39,750
Am I supposed to stop working?

1539
02:07:40,166 --> 02:07:41,625
Not at all.

1540
02:07:42,541 --> 02:07:43,583
Slow down

1541
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:46,333
to perfect every single detail.

1542
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:49,000
Make beautiful works.

1543
02:07:49,458 --> 02:07:51,166
Complete in every way.

1544
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:53,583
A tabernacle of God's Word.

1545
02:07:57,041 --> 02:08:00,541
Increase the level
through the power of our Lord.

1546
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:08,375
Do you know what the scammers
made me realize?

1547
02:08:08,541 --> 02:08:09,666
What is it?

1548
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,958
I'll always be around scammers
and greedy folks.

1549
02:08:14,125 --> 02:08:15,833
To become independent,

1550
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,250
I must have my own money
for making movies.

1551
02:08:19,833 --> 02:08:25,250
I've matured enough to stop making
money for myself, and make it for God.

1552
02:08:25,416 --> 02:08:28,291
- Not a bad divine trip, isn't it?
- Yep.

1553
02:08:29,625 --> 02:08:33,041
I, a dude focused on making money
in life,

1554
02:08:33,666 --> 02:08:37,375
have reached a point where I pray to God
to give me control over talents.

1555
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:42,541
Infinite resources that I'll manage wisely
and effectively to create our Lord's works.

1556
02:08:42,666 --> 02:08:47,875
This kind of money can't be made
in Poland. Not even in the UK.

1557
02:08:48,666 --> 02:08:53,041
This is Victor.
He used to work for the GRU.

1558
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:54,833
There is the good CIA,

1559
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:56,666
and the bad CIA.

1560
02:08:57,291 --> 02:08:59,333
I've my man in the good one.

1561
02:08:59,875 --> 02:09:02,791
The money you're looking for
is on Wall Street.

1562
02:09:02,875 --> 02:09:06,333
We'll get you the financing.
Our cut...

1563
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:10,250
is 200 million dollars.

1564
02:09:14,125 --> 02:09:16,958
- You want to steal it?
- Yes.

1565
02:09:17,541 --> 02:09:19,375
You'll get a hundred.

1566
02:09:19,875 --> 02:09:24,833
We need 2 months
to see the deal through.

1567
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:31,375
I'll make my last movie.

1568
02:09:32,166 --> 02:09:33,166
But...

1569
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:35,083
last in your life?

1570
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:36,791
In Poland.

1571
02:09:38,125 --> 02:09:42,583
I'll never be able to make a masterpiece,
unless I find a sufficient budget.

1572
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:46,625
And in order to accomplish that,
I must start making movies in English

1573
02:09:46,791 --> 02:09:51,375
with Hollywood actors that will be
distributed all over the world.

1574
02:09:51,833 --> 02:09:54,083
How much do you need?

1575
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:55,375
A lot.

1576
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:00,708
So?

1577
02:10:01,125 --> 02:10:02,791
- Shall we go ahead with it?
- No.

1578
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,416
No?

1579
02:10:06,541 --> 02:10:10,750
I don't want a single dollar out of it.
There's no such money

1580
02:10:10,833 --> 02:10:15,416
that'd make me break the seventh
commandment and betray Jesus Christ.

1581
02:10:18,375 --> 02:10:21,250
God opens amazing new spaces for me.

1582
02:10:22,333 --> 02:10:24,333
I'll set up a movie holding

1583
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:27,666
in several countries,
where I'll operate in dollars,

1584
02:10:27,833 --> 02:10:31,416
pounds, euros, yens, yuan,
and Swedish crowns.

1585
02:10:39,791 --> 02:10:41,541
God has a sense of humor.

1586
02:10:41,666 --> 02:10:44,583
I prayed and I know
how to obtain the funds.

1587
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:49,500
I'll finance spreading the Word
of God to Islamists that support ISIS.

1588
02:10:50,375 --> 02:10:51,375
Uh-huh.

1589
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I'll get the money in Qatar.

1590
02:10:56,625 --> 02:10:59,291
From the guys whose airspace
has been blocked out

1591
02:10:59,458 --> 02:11:02,625
for financing ISIS.
They have Al Jazeera.

1592
02:11:02,958 --> 02:11:05,625
Do you understand...
God's genius?

1593
02:11:05,916 --> 02:11:08,875
- It's a Trojan horse.
- If they don't cut your head off.

1594
02:11:09,416 --> 02:11:11,416
Prosperity comes from God.

1595
02:11:13,541 --> 02:11:15,083
It's a gift for you.

1596
02:11:23,666 --> 02:11:28,041
See how generous our Lord's been to us.
Where we started...

1597
02:11:28,250 --> 02:11:30,083
The road we've walked...

1598
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:34,583
Now my mom drives a Porsche.

1599
02:11:35,625 --> 02:11:37,916
One can't get bored with you, son.

1600
02:11:40,583 --> 02:11:43,500
Thank God you grew up
without your father.

1601
02:11:46,041 --> 02:11:48,958
He would've made you
a completely different man.

1602
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:50,875
A different child.

1603
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:53,166
You wouldn't have achieved

1604
02:11:53,333 --> 02:11:56,166
what you have,
or become who you are.

1605
02:11:56,958 --> 02:11:58,375
I never was a child.

1606
02:11:59,791 --> 02:12:02,250
I was born a grown-up man.

1607
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:05,416
And I suffered for the lack
of my earthly father.

1608
02:12:05,583 --> 02:12:08,833
It had an impact
on my relations with women.

1609
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:11,875
I had no role models because of him.

1610
02:12:12,041 --> 02:12:14,166
And almost ended up in prison,

1611
02:12:15,750 --> 02:12:20,333
as I was growing up without the sense
of security that fathers give.

1612
02:12:21,791 --> 02:12:25,166
Only now have I understood
that I've always had...

1613
02:12:25,916 --> 02:12:28,750
this Father by my side.
The Father...

1614
02:12:29,666 --> 02:12:33,250
that has always protected me.
Fought for me...

1615
02:12:34,625 --> 02:12:35,916
And saved me...

1616
02:12:36,375 --> 02:12:38,916
even when I was an animal...

1617
02:12:40,625 --> 02:12:44,625
dwelling in a dark den
the evil one had lured me into.

1618
02:12:48,625 --> 02:12:52,041
I owe it only to God
that I'm on my way to Qatar.

1619
02:12:53,083 --> 02:12:55,791
I can jump into the fire with him.

1620
02:12:55,958 --> 02:12:57,833
And I know I won't burn...

1621
02:12:58,958 --> 02:13:01,041
and flames won't devour me.

1622
02:13:04,416 --> 02:13:05,625
Write me,

1623
02:13:06,083 --> 02:13:07,958
when you get there...

1624
02:13:11,416 --> 02:13:12,541
Pacio.

1625
02:13:19,250 --> 02:13:20,291
Mr PATRYK,

1626
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:24,250
what do you intend
to spend the funds on?

1627
02:13:28,375 --> 02:13:30,583
I want to be number one.

1628
