1
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,600
Hey.

2
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,800
Morning. Oh.

3
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,400
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

4
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,099
Hello? Hi.

5
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,500
I'm across the street.

6
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,000
Who?

7
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,499
No. No, no, there's
nothing wrong with

8
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,800
the ad layouts. I
checked them myself.

9
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,800
Marjorie just must've gotten
the months wrong again.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,800
Yeah. Okay. Have you
talked to Laslo yet?

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,900
I don't care if he's upset.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,288
Call Peter back and tell him the

13
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,900
fashion layouts have
to be four pages.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Not seven, not six,
not five. Four.

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,600
That's because we
changed photographers.

16
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,100
You must be kidding. I
doubled-checked everything.

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,789
What's wrong with the ad layouts?

18
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,600
What's wrong with the
ad layouts, Leo?

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,110
I'll tell you what's
wrong. Practically

20
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:06,000
everything, because they're
the wrong ad layouts.

21
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,502
Marjorie, I have no idea...

22
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:10,600
Why am I standing here looking
at 30 pages of wrong layouts?

23
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,400
I'll tell you why.
Because someone...

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,200
Leo... didn't do their job.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,300
Okay, the copy on the cover
reads "Office Love Affairs:

26
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
How to Get Him and Your Raise."

27
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,500
- Good.
- Yeah?

28
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,300
Okay, look at me. Good.
Come in a little closer.

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,900
Okay. Right here.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Great. Good. I think we got it.

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,600
Carry on. Papaya diet?

32
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,100
Big problem. They're talking
about changing the fruit.

33
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,171
What type of fruit?

34
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,300
I don't know. They said
kiwi or something.

35
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,578
I don't like kiwi.

36
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,899
These came for you.
They're from Frank.

37
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,600
My goodness. He is so
sweet. He was in London.

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,900
Very exotic and expensive.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,849
"Can't wait to see
you. It's felt like

40
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,700
an eternity." How
long's he been gone?

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,699
- Two days.
- Two days?

42
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Yes.

43
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,700
"Meet me here at 7:30."
Ooh, good choice.

44
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,000
"Bring doll"?

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,400
Doll. He does this kind
of thing all the time.

46
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,200
Hula dolls, Polynesian restaurant.

47
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,200
Now just what are you up to?

48
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,899
- It's all part of the surprise.
- Thank you.

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
- Surprise?
- Huh.

50
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,024
Sur... You're not breaking
up with me, are you?

51
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,025
No.

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,399
Okay. Are you sure?
Because %69 of all

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,700
relationships break
up in restaurants.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,100
We're not breaking up.

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,500
In fact, I want to increase
the romance in our lives.

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,500
- You do?
- Huh.

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,500
- First, close your eyes.
- Now?

58
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,500
- Close them.
- Okay.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Now remember all the times you
said we never go anywhere...

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,200
and we're always working
and we never have any fun?

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,549
Well, yeah.

62
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,299
Well, open your eyes and
look where I'm taking you.

63
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,500
Come on.

64
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,099
- Oh, you're kidding.
- You and me in two weeks.

65
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,499
- In two weeks? I can't.
- Oh-Oh, you can.

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
I can?

67
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,900
Huh. I cleared it with Marjorie.

68
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,300
You did? Oh, you're a sneak.

69
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,100
Yeah. Six days and seven nights...

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,600
on the secluded tropical
island paradise of Makatea.

71
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,317
Yeah. Yeah. We arrived
50 minutes late.

72
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh, is that a problem?

73
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,700
No, no, that's fine.
I'll tell you what.

74
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,570
Why don't I go find
the bags, and you,

75
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:57,899
you get to go find
the charter, okay?

76
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
I do?

77
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,399
Yeah, I'll see you in ten minutes.

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,700
- All right. Okay.
- Sweetie.

79
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,000
- Love you.
- Love you.

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,500
- Excuse me.
- You son of a bitch.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
You miserable piece of rat shit.

82
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,700
Could you help me? I'm looking
for Tropical Charters.

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,400
- You going to Makatea?
- Yes.

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,700
Well, we'll be ready
in ten... 20 minutes.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But this... this isn't the plane?

86
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
- What?
- The plane.

87
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
Where's its mummy?

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,100
Oh. Tropical's plane
is laid up in Fiji.

89
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,399
We're filling in. You're
in luck. I'm your pilot.

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,200
No. I can't...

91
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,000
No. I can't go in this.
It's, It's broken.

92
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,399
No, it's not broken.
It's being maintained.

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,500
- This is my plane.
- Huh.

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,898
This is the De Haviland
Beaver. This is one of

95
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,100
the safest, most reliable
planes ever built.

96
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Sweetie, there a problem?

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,900
Yes.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,900
He, He seems to think we're
gonna go in this old thing.

99
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:42,999
What?

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think... I think we could
find another charter.

101
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,299
You won't find one. There's a
boat leaves from the port.

102
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
It takes three days.

103
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,300
- Honey. Frank.
- All right, all right.

104
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
Sweetie, I'm sure the
plane is perfectly safe.

105
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,000
And I'm sure the pilot is
a trained professional.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,600
- He is the pilot.
- He...

107
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, if you're going,
it'll be 20... 30 minutes.

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,539
Gotta get some oil.

109
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,900
Oil. He's gonna get some oil now?

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,100
- Need help with this luggage?
- No. - No, we're good.

111
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,800
All right, everybody tied down?

112
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,800
Listen, are these
really necessary?

113
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Only if we crash.

114
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,124
Hi.

115
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:34,200
Everybody, this is Angelica,
our flight service director.

116
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,600
Hello. Thank you. Hi.

117
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,400
Hello. Sorry. Excuse me. Ooh.

118
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,300
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

119
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,800
- Ooh.
- Come here, baby.

120
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,800
Hello. Are you guys
going to Makatea?

121
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
We hope.

122
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,800
Oh, you'll love it. Are
you from the States?

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes.

124
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,699
I lived there for a while
too. It's very fun.

125
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,000
Hey, Quinn, look. Look what I got.

126
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,300
- Check it out.
- What's that, baby?

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,500
It's a bathing suit, silly.

128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,300
I thought it was an eye patch.

129
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,900
Welcome to Makatea.

130
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,700
Here we are. Thanks for
flying Harris Freight,

131
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,376
where frequent flyers earn bonus

132
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:03,300
points good for
valuable merchandise.

133
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Hey, you're not trying to
steal my vest, are you?

134
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,200
- Miss Monroe?
- Yes.

135
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,400
- Welcome to Hanaiti.
- Thank you.

136
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,374
I'm Phillipe St. Claire,
the general manager.

137
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,375
Hi.

138
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:22,000
Can we have the reservation
for Mr Martin?

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,500
Oh. Oh, this is beautiful.

140
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,900
Wow.

141
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,900
Wow.

142
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,700
Okay. All right,
we're never leaving.

143
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

144
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,027
I want this to be the most

145
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:49,700
unforgettable vacation
of our lives.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,294
Having a good time?

147
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:59,700
Oh, honey, I'm
having a great time.

148
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,200
- Hey, you know what today is?
- What?

149
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,899
- It's our anniversary.
- We have an anniversary?

150
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
Yeah, unofficially.

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,449
Three years ago
today, we first met.

152
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,600
Today?

153
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,100
Today. You don't remember?
We fought over a cab.

154
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,808
Oh, I called you a jerk. Yes. Yes.

155
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,200
Oh, great, that you remember.

156
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:21,274
Sorry.

157
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,900
That's okay. It was all
part of love's odyssey.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,300
Odyssey?

159
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,436
If I asked, "Would
you wear something

160
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:31,600
special for me tonight..."

161
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,200
What'd you have in mind?

162
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,600
This.

163
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,400

How long have you been on Makatea?

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,300
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

177
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,600
You brought me here... today.

178
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,600
Five hours ago?

179
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Oh. So much has
happened since then...

180
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,900
Oh. Oops. Oopsy.

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,700
Wow. There you go.

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,700
- I slipped.
- Yeah.

183
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,200
So where is your, copilot?

184
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,400
Oh, she's busy with the tourists.

185
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,600
Well, that sounds like
you don't like us.

186
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,800
Oh, no. Never bite the hand
that feeds... your mouth.

187
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,400
Whatever.

188
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,600
Besides, you know, they're...
they're good for a laugh.

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,400
- You're a big laugher, are you?
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Oh.

191
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,900
They come here looking
for "the magic,"

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
expecting to find romance...

193
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,400
when they can't find
it any other place.

194
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Maybe they will.

195
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
It's an island, babe.

196
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,500
If you don't bring it here,
you won't find it here.

197
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh, heavy. Pilot and philosopher.

198
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,100
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Hey, I'm here with somebody.

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,800
You remember him?
He came in with me.

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,100
I meant both of you.

201
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,300
No, you didn't.

202
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,742
You're from New York, aren't you?

203
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,500
Hey, is everything okay?

204
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,700
- Well, hi. Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

205
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,400
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Oh, that's very...

206
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,700
- Let's go.
- Oh, but we're leaving. And so...

207
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
- Well, maybe some other time...
- Ta-ta.

208
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,800
I'll buy you a drink.

209
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,200
Okay. Bye.

210
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
- Was he bothering you?
- Oh, no.

211
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,345
Was he hitting on
you? From over there,

212
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:53,100
it looked like he
was hitting on you.

213
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:54,189
Maybe a little...

214
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,900
He was? Do you want me to
do something about it?

215
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:57,999
Like what?

216
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hey, I don't go to the gym every
day just to watch old guys shower.

217
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,500
- You know, I will...
- Really? Really?

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,600
Well done, ocean. Well done, sky.

219
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,600
Well done, mai tais.

220
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,800
Well done, silicone. Oh, my.

221
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,500
- Hey.
- Ow.

222
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,300
Hey, I'm getting a
little toasty here.

223
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
You want me to put some
cream on you, honey?

224
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,700
You'd do that for me?
You'd cream me up?

225
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,599
Only for you. Where is it?

226
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Excuse me. Miss Monroe?
You have a phone call.

227
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,900
- I do?
- You could take it at the bar.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,470
What... Who would be
calling you here?

229
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,400
I have no idea. I'll be back.

230
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,939
Could I get two mai tais, please?

231
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Yes, madam.

232
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,600
Thank you. Hello?

233
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,100
Look, I know you're on vacation,
but this is a dire emergency.

234
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,299
Oh, no.

235
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,600
The photo shoot's on, but it's
an availability nightmare.

236
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,600
Vendela and Evander Holyfield only
have a mutual 17-hour window.

237
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,767
If we don't get them now, nobody's
available for four months...

238
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
and we lose them
for the May cover.

239
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,800
There's got to be somebody closer
whose life you can screw up.

240
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,100
That's the ironic thing,
dear. There's not.

241
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Vendela's in Sydney.
Evander's in Osaka.

242
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,700
I threw Taylor on a plane
this morning to Papeete.

243
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,700
- Tahiti?
- Yes. They're all coming to you.

244
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,375
All you have to do is
fly back to Tahiti,

245
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:30,400
babysit the shoot, fly back out.

246
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,100
- Fifteen hours at the most.
- Look, this is complicated.

247
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,500
Frank proposed to me last night.

248
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,799
Oh, my God. This is so exciting.
Sweetie, I'm so happy for you.

249
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,900
Well, I'm glad, but
the point is...

250
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,584
what kind of message
am I sending to

251
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:48,299
Frank if the day after
our betrothal...

252
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm leaving him to go
on some photo shoot?

253
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,764
An excellent message.
This is the perfect

254
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:59,200
opportunity to
establish parameters.

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
Oh, God.

256
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,900
I read somewhere that
%38.6 of all women...

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,073
are pressured into quitting their

258
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,400
jobs in the first
year of marriage.

259
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,900
Marjorie, you read that in our
magazine, and we made it up.

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,400
Oh, please, Robin, please.
Please, please, Robin. Please.

261
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,400
Deal.

262
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,100
Oh, good. Do you have
a way back to Tahiti?

263
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,100
Oh, yeah. I can...

264
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,400
Feels good? Yeah?

265
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,800
Don't move a muscle.

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,500
Lay down. Stay.

267
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,700
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

268
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,500
- I'm looking for...
- Quinny, it's for you.

269
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,900
Hi there.

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm really sorry to interrupt
you. I sort of have an emergency.

271
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,000
Emergency? What's going on?

272
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,200
Well, my boss called me, and she
wants me to go to Tahiti tonight.

273
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,200
Well, I'm sort of
on my layover here.

274
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,700
Right. Would $500 cut
your layover short?

275
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,300
Baby, wanna go to Papeete?

276
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,800
I can't. I have a show tonight.
Tuesday is Tamure night.

277
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,200
It's Tamure night.
My hands are tied.

278
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,600
Oh. That's for later.

279
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,400
You know, I'm stuck. I...
This is really important.

280
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,700
You'd be doing me a tremendous
favour. How would 700 be?

281
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,200
Okay.

282
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

283
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Great.

284
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,200
I'll meet you at the plane,
and give me an hour.

285
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,200
Great. Thank you.

286
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,700
Honey, it's a known fact
that %38.6 of all women...

287
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,700
are pressured into quitting their
jobs the first year of marriage.

288
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,200
That was in your magazine.
You probably made it up.

289
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,300
If you had to work,
I would understand.

290
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,600
That's because you're not
as romantic as I am.

291
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,200
So come with me.

292
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,200
- No.
- How come?

293
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,400
Because if I go with you, I'll
resent the fact that I'm there.

294
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,700
If I stay here, I'll miss
you, but you'll feel guilty.

295
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,320
I like that better.

296
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:34,000
Come on. It's only for one night.

297
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,800
- Hubby.
- Say that again.

298
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,400
What, hubby?

299
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,400
- I like that. Say it.
- Hubby.

300
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,300
- Ready to go.
- Is it safe to fly?

301
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,600
- It is with me.
- Oh, you're that good, huh?

302
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm the best you've
ever been with.

303
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm not sure I trust
your equipment.

304
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,100
We may be old, but we're sturdy.

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,344
What's all this?

306
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,700
Hotel overstocks, local trinkets.

307
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,273
I was gonna fly them
to Tahiti tomorrow,

308
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:15,300
but with your job, I got a twofer.

309
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,700
How handy for you.

310
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,700
Excuse me. I just wanna keep
this from flying at you.

311
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
There we go.

312
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,800
- Do you have my, money?
- Oh, yes.

313
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,800
- Thank you.
- It's all there.

314
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
I trust you.

315
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,500
So what kind of work do you
do back there in New York?

316
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,500
I'm an assistant editor for
a magazine called Dazzle.

317
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,500
- Dazzle?
- Yeah.

318
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,999
Never heard of that one.

319
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,800
You're not exactly the
demographic we shoot for.

320
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,800
This is it.

321
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,400
Dazzle.

322
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,600
"Your Derriere: Five Exercises
to Tame the Beast."

323
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,900
"Ten Ways to Light His Fire."

324
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,300
For pete sake.

325
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,800
Ten ways to light his fire.

326
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,549
You know how a woman
gets a man excited?

327
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,550
How?

328
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:54,500
She shows up, and that's it.
We're guys. We're easy.

329
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,269
Of course, for that you can't

330
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,400
charge six bucks
an issue, can you?

331
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,800
Does that advice
come with the 700...

332
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Or do I need to pay
extra for that?

333
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,100
It's on the house.

334
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,100
Thanks.

335
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,500
Island flight watch, Beaver 0318.

336
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,900
We are 3,500 on a heading of 110.

337
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,700
Looking for a weather update,
please, along our route of flight.

338
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,300
Be advised...

339
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,900
southwesterly...

340
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,900
Say again.

341
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm sorry. This weather came up
quicker than anybody anticipated.

342
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,400
We're gonna have to
turn back to Makatea.

343
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,600
- It's just not worth the risk.
- All right.

344
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,800
A line of squalls has
got us boxed in.

345
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,700
Tighten up your seat belt.
It's gonna get bumpy.

346
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,700
Wha...

347
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,574
You don't... you don't mind if I

348
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:44,200
just... come sit up here with you?

349
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,900
Get your seat belt on.

350
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,400
- What are those?
- Xanax.

351
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,469
My doctor prescribed
them for situations

352
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,200
of tension. I think
this qualifies.

353
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,800
- Give me a couple.
- You just drive.

354
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,000
- What are you taking now?
- Xanax.

355
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,500
My doctor prescribed them for
situations of "sension."

356
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
Give me those.

357
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,500
Whoo. Hey.

358
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,100
That was close, huh? Whoo.

359
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,100
That was more than
close. That hit us.

360
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,700
- No?
- Shit. Fried the radios.

361
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,300
Oh, no. That's bad, huh?

362
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,000
Mayday, Mayday,
Mayday. Beaver 0318.

363
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,400
We're unable to maintain altitude.

364
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,800
Can anybody hear this?

365
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,900
- Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
- Attention Kmart shoppers.

366
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,800
Snow shovels are
on sale for 12.99.

367
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,300
Put that down. I'm unable
to maintain altitude.

368
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,702
Forty miles,
south-south-east of Makatea.

369
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday

370
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,300
How many of those
things did you take?

371
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,800
You know, I just don't know.

372
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,800
- Look.
- What?

373
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,500
We're in trouble here. I want
you to sit back, be quiet,

374
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,000
Keep your seat belt tight
and let me fly this thing.

375
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,600
Yes, sir.

376
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,500
There's an island down there.

377
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,100
I can see a beach. I'm
gonna set us down.

378
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Okey-dokey.

379
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,458
Rock on the beach. There's
a rock on the beach.

380
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:03,459
Son of a bitch.

381
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,200
Blah.

382
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,000
Good morning.

383
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,300
Could you get me a cup of coffee?

384
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,700
Oh, sure. I'll get
right on it, madam.

385
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,000
Oh, God. What...

386
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,000
- Where are we?
- Here.

387
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,500
Where? Where?

388
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,399
Somewhere between
Makatea and Tahiti.

389
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,900
That's... That's the
best I can do for you.

390
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Whoa. What happened?

391
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,800
It crumpled the landing
gear when we hit.

392
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,000
Well, aren't you gonna fix it?

393
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
I mean, can't we... can't
we reattach it somehow?

394
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,400
Oh, sure. We'll, like, glue
it back on. How's that?

395
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,300
- Aren't you one of those guys?
- What guys?

396
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,599
Those guy guys. You know,
those guys with skills.

397
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,000
- Skills?
- Yeah.

398
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,817
You send them out
into the wilderness

399
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,400
with a pocket knife and a Q-Tip...

400
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
and they build you
a shopping mall.

401
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,900
- You can't do that?
- No. No, I can't do that.

402
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,200
But I can do this.

403
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,800
Does that help?

404
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,500
I can get us out of here.

405
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,000
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

406
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,500
Hey. Right? Huh?

407
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,500
Phone, huh?

408
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,300
I'm gonna get us out of here...

409
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,300
Pronto.

410
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,100
Come on, phone.

411
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,600
So, what are we,
like, shipwrecked?

412
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,100
- How do you want it?
- Excuse me?

413
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,300
Do you want it sugar-coated
or right between the eyes?

414
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,200
You pick.

415
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,999
We've only got one wheel,
so we can't take off.

416
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,400
Lightning fried the radio and the
emergency location transmitter.

417
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,273
Air-Sea will probably
try a rescue,

418
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,900
but without a beacon to hone in,

419
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
it's like trying to find a
flea on an elephant's ass.

420
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,600
The only thing we've got is...

421
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,600
this flare gun and a single flare.

422
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,800
Is it too late to get
it sugar-coated?

423
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,100
That was sugar-coated.

424
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Well, then, what's the bad news?

425
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,600
The bad news is we may be
here for a... long time.

426
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,900
You and me,

427
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,300
for a long, long...

428
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,400
long, long, long, long time.

429
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,600
Well, I want my $700 back.

430
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:03,249
What?

431
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,799
You heard me. My $700,
I want it back.

432
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,100
You said you were gonna take
me to Tahiti. You didn't.

433
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,400
Give it back.

434
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,200
Come on.

435
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,200
One, two,

436
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,200
three...

437
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,700
I figure I got you halfway.

438
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,500
Halfway? Halfway?

439
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
- Halfway.
- Halfway? Whoo.

440
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Halfway. Oh, boy, you're good.

441
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,900
Whoo. You got me halfway.
That's fantastic.

442
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Wha... What are you doing? Hey,
hey. Get away from my plane.

443
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,499
- Goddamn it, get out of there.
- I'm gonna do something.

444
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,800
- Hey, leave that stuff alone.
- You shut up.

445
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,300
Come on now. Get out of there.
What do you think you're doing?

446
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,800
Leave my stuff al...
Hey, hey. Come on.

447
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,900
- What's this? It's a boat.
- It's a life raft.

448
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,590
We can use that to
get off the island.

449
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:02,600
Where are you gonna go?

450
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,200
You don't even know where you are.
Last thing you wanna do is...

451
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,900
go bouncing around the ocean
in an eight-foot blow-up boat.

452
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,200
- Don't tell me what I want.
- Give that to me. Give it.

453
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
Hey, don't pull on
that. Leave it alone.

454
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Wait. Wait. Get me out... No.

455
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,800
Get me out of here.

456
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,700
Get me... Get me out of here.

457
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,200
You gonna stop acting
like a lunatic?

458
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,600
- Fuck you.
- Pardon me? What'd you say?

459
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,000
That's what I thought you said.

460
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,600
Yeah.

461
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,900
Mr Martin?

462
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,611
There's a telephone
call for Miss Monroe.

463
00:33:16,612 --> 00:33:17,799
Oh. I'll take it.

464
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,900
Hello? Hello?

465
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,100
This is Frank Martin. Who is...

466
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,400
Oh, hi, Marjorie. It's Frank.

467
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,300
No, she... she left yesterday.

468
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,900
What?

469
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,400
Marie, it's Phillippe at Makatea.

470
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,100
Quinn flew a lady back
to you last night.

471
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,800
Can you look if the De Haviland
is at the gate? No, I'll wait.

472
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,800
I ran into Tony. He said that
Quinny didn't make Tahiti.

473
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,612
Hold on, Angelica. We don't know

474
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:48,700
anything yet. Yes,
Marie, right here.

475
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Bon. Get Air-Sea Rescue,
Marie, and call me back.

476
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,400
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

477
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,500
Come on. You wanna drink
water, you got to haul water.

478
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,500
Let's go.

479
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,800
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

480
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,800
- Something.
- Nothing.

481
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,774
Oh, don't give me that.
You were ogling.

482
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:18,900
- "Ogling"?
- Yeah.

483
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,400
Ogling? Let me ask you something.

484
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
What?

485
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,500
When you go into a store to
buy something like that,

486
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,377
what do you say to
the clerk, "Give me

487
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:27,100
that outfit so nobody
will look at me?"

488
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,700
No, I like people
looking, just not you.

489
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,399
If it makes you feel any
better, you're not my type.

490
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Oh, good.

491
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:43,300
- Why?
- "Why"?

492
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
Yeah. I'm making
conversation. Why?

493
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,399
You talk too much.
You're opinionated.

494
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,600
You're stubborn,
sarcastic and stuck-up.

495
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,000
Your ass is too narrow, and
your tits are too small.

496
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,149
Hey, you wanna know why
you're not my type?

497
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,150
Nope.

498
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,700
Bonjour. Bonjour. Parlez vous...

499
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,700
- I'm American.
- Oh, thank God.

500
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,818
Tom Morrow. I'll take you up.

501
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,200
Frank. Listen. So how
do we find them?

502
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,700
We're gonna fly over the water
and look out the window.

503
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Wha... Whoa, whoa,
whoa. That's it?

504
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,099
What about the modern technology?
Don't you have satellites, lasers,

505
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,300
- Mr Martin, just take your seat.
- Heat-seeking kind of...

506
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
- I'm Ricky.
- Yeah, great. I'm Frank.

507
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,751
Listen, money is no
object, all right?

508
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:39,752
Yeah. Just get in.

509
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,700
Try breathing very deeply.
I find that helpful.

510
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,255
If they went into the
water, it's only been

511
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:51,300
12 hours. It's a good
chance we'll find them.

512
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,400
Okay.

513
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,000
Hey, Bwana, why don't you
let me lead for a while?

514
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,900
Okay. This'll be interesting.

515
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,800
Now there. You see? I found it.

516
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,300
Come on, Quinny.

517
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,900
Oh, my God.

518
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,700
Oh, it's beautiful.

519
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,000
Quinn, this is...

520
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,899
Ooh. Oooh.

521
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,100
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on.
- Whoa.

522
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,400
- What are you doing?
- What the hell's that?

523
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,900
It's a pig. What are
you worried about?

524
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,600
He's more afraid of
us than we... Watch.

525
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,400
Ha. Go on. Go on. Go
on. Get out of here.

526
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,400
Ho-ha. Ha.

527
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,400
Come on. Come on.

528
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,200
- Whoa.
- Come on.

529
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,600
- Hey, Quinn.
- Huh? What?

530
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,600
What?

531
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,400
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but...

532
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,100
I'm having a bit of a problem.

533
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,900
What's the problem?

534
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,100
Some sort of creature has
just swum up my pants.

535
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,800
I'm guessing... I'm
guessing a snake.

536
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,800
Oh.

537
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,800
That's bad.

538
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,500
So, what do I do?

539
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,900
I mean, I could reach
down and... and grab it.

540
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,600
No. That... That could be
risky. Might be poisonous.

541
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,899
Well, right. But
on the other hand,

542
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,100
if it's poisonous
and will bite me,

543
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,100
do I want to allow it to continue
to swim around in my shorts?

544
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,389
All good questions.

545
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,600
Would you just give
me some advice?

546
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,800
Just advice, input,
anything. Give it to me.

547
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm very open at this
particular juncture, all right?

548
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,000
- Just stand still.
- Still.

549
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,000
- Stand still.
- What are you doing?

550
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,200
- Relax.
- Right.

551
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh, God.

552
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,300
- Oh, no.
- What?

553
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,200
- Not good.
- What? Wha...

554
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,599
I'm trying to concentrate here.

555
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,000
Okay. Okay.

556
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,000
Now, let's see.

557
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,000
Better not catch you smiling.

558
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,600
Ooo-ooo.

559
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,300
Thanks.

560
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,800
Well, I'm not without skills.

561
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Whoa. You going on a date?

562
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,400
- Do you like it?
- Why the fashion statement?

563
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,200
- Going hunting.
- Ooh, for what?

564
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,000
No.

565
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,700
You wouldn't.

566
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,700
They are magnificent creatures.

567
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,600
And I hear they taste
just like chicken.

568
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,600
Chicken?

569
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,399
♪ Paradise ♪

570
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,700
Hey.

571
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,400
Maybe I should have a taste.

572
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,035
You know, just in
case somebody asks me

573
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:20,400
someday, "Have you
ever had peacock?"

574
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,400
- I can say, "Yes, I have."
- You won't regret it.

575
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,400
Okay, perfect.

576
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,900
Whoo. Ah.

577
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,100
Oh.

578
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Oh, my God.

579
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,200
Wow.

580
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,300
Chicken. Okay, chicken.

581
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,000
Have you always been a pilot?

582
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,999
All my grown-up life.

583
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,999
- Like doing what?
- All kinds of flying.

584
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,100
I had my own very
successful business.

585
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,300
What happened?

586
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,900
Well,

587
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,300
I found a better way
of life, that's all.

588
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,100
Like what?

589
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,400
Came out here, got a nice little
house on a beautiful beach.

590
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,000
Got my plane.

591
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,800
Doing what I want to do.

592
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,200
Got peace and quiet.

593
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,100
Living the life every
man dreams of.

594
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,600
Well, yeah, until they're 12.

595
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,700
I'm sorry. That was out of line.

596
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,200
- No.
- I'm just...

597
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,100
I'm just cranky, you know,
from being shipwrecked.

598
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,500
Look at that sky. You don't see a
sky like that in New York City.

599
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,800
No, that's a good sky.

600
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,800
- Whoa.
- All right. Sorry.

601
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,800
I'm just a little tipsy.

602
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,500
Good night.

603
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,000
Good night.

604
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,200
Suave.

605
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,500
Really suave.

606
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,900
Oh, my God. It's a plane. Oh.

607
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,200
A plane. What do... A
flare. We need the flare.

608
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,300
Quinn?

609
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,200
Quinn? Get up.

610
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,800
There's a plane.

611
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,500
Okay.

612
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,000
Flare. Jesus. Okay.

613
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,300
- Hey, baby.
- Oh, no.

614
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,600
Oh, boy. Oh.

615
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,800
Oh, no.

616
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,300
Oh. Oh. Oh, no.

617
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,300
Oh, nuts.

618
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,800
What's...

619
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,300
What the hell did
you do? What the...

620
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,782
You... You wasted our only goddamn

621
00:45:38,783 --> 00:45:41,600
flare... to shoot a
goddamn palm tree?

622
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,700
I wouldn't have shot the goddamn
tree if you hadn't rolled into me.

623
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,900
I was trying to signal
the goddamn plane.

624
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,100
What goddamn plane?

625
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,900
That goddamn plane.

626
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,700
- That goddamn plane?
- Yeah.

627
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,115
That's a commercial
airliner. It's five

628
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:03,200
miles high going
600 miles an hour.

629
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,444
They wouldn't see a
nuclear explosion if

630
00:46:05,445 --> 00:46:07,800
they were looking for
it, much less a flare.

631
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,800
How was I supposed to know that?

632
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,198
If you hadn't drunken
yourself into a

633
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,600
coma, maybe you could
have told me that.

634
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,874
You know what you've done?
You know what you've done?

635
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:15,875
What?

636
00:46:15,876 --> 00:46:19,500
You've taken our one good chance
of being found and pissed it away.

637
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,849
Don't you dare blame
this on me. If you were

638
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,100
half a pilot, we wouldn't
be on this island.

639
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,200
I am the best goddamn pilot
you're ever gonna meet.

640
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
Ha. I've flown with you twice.
You've crashed half the time.

641
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,800
And there is nothing
wrong with my tits.

642
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,300
There's so much water.

643
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,400
Don't worry.

644
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,737
Wherever they are,
Quinny is going to

645
00:46:58,738 --> 00:47:00,800
take good care of your girlfriend.

646
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,800
What do you mean by that?

647
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,100
Come on. Let's pick
up the pace a little.

648
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,400
I wanna get to the
top before dark.

649
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Goddamn.

650
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,700
I've had just about as much
vacation as I can stand.

651
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,400
- Stop. Stop.
- Stop?

652
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,400
- Stop. Stop.
- What?

653
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,000
What?

654
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,400
We better find the beacon.

655
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,400
This way.

656
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,300
That beacon better be up there.

657
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,800
Look. The storm blew us
south-west 40 minutes.

658
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,200
A good chance this is Tamitange.

659
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,800
Ah, Tamitange. Well, that
explains everything.

660
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,300
There's a radio navigation
beacon on top of Tamitange.

661
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,709
We find it. We shut it down. They

662
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,299
come out and fix
it. We're rescued.

663
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,100
It took them two years to fix the
street light outside my apartment.

664
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,800
Wow, this is beautiful, huh?

665
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,600
So where's the beacon?

666
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,600
Huh?

667
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,100
Oh, let me see.

668
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,588
It's this one?
Tamitange, the one with

669
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:53,100
the funny-shaped
peninsula to the north.

670
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,100
Yeah.

671
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,200
Well, that... that's north, right?

672
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,500
- Right?
- Yeah.

673
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,400
There's no peninsula.

674
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,200
Who stole the peninsula?

675
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,000
No.

676
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,800
This isn't Tamitange?

677
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,400
So there is no beacon...

678
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,702
that we're gonna
turn off and they're

679
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:28,500
gonna come fix it and find us?

680
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,600
Well, we could be...

681
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,200
We could be further to the south.

682
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,300
This could be Mata Nui.

683
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,500
Mata Nui?

684
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,900
And what's on Mata Nui?

685
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,400
Us.

686
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,300
What? Wait, wait.

687
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,600
What are you doing?

688
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,900
Son of a bitch. Goddamn it.

689
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,400
Please don't do that again.

690
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,649
I just want one goddamn
thing to go right.

691
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh, God.

692
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,500
I know. Come on.

693
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,700
Ever since we've been here,
you've been so confident.

694
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,800
You have all the answers.

695
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,200
Well, I'm the captain.
That's my job.

696
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,600
It's no good for me to go waving
my arms in the air and screaming,

697
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,500
"Oh, shit. We're gonna die."

698
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,800
Doesn't evoke much
confidence, does it?

699
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,500
No, no, that does not.

700
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,300
I need you to be my
confident captain.

701
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,099
I can't tell you how difficult
this is gonna be for me...

702
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,700
if you lose it.

703
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,900
Okay.

704
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,300
Okay.

705
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,400
- I'm all right now.
- Good, good. Good.

706
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,000
Qui-Quinn. Quinn.

707
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,700
What? What?

708
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,700
What do you need? Hey. Come on.
Get out of that. What do you want?

709
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,700
I... Look, look, look.
Come here. Oh, yes.

710
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,900
It's a boat.

711
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,100
Looks like they're
putting into that cove.

712
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,600
Yeah, well, how do we signal them?

713
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,800
A flare'd be nice.

714
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:06,200
Don't start. Come
on. What do we do?

715
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,499
How do we get down there?

716
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,700
- We go, down the mountain...
- Yeah.

717
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,700
Up the mountain,
down the mountain.

718
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,968
We get to our life
raft and... hope

719
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:15,234
they'll still be there
in the morning.

720
00:53:15,236 --> 00:53:16,236
Huh.

721
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:17,636
Come on.

722
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,800
Oh, God.

723
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,400
- Come on. I'll take over.
- Oh, God. Thanks.

724
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,800
So what's the deal with you and...

725
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,700
Mm.

726
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,900
- Angelica.
- Yeah.

727
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,600
There's no deal. We're friends.

728
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,200
She works at the hotel a
couple of months a year.

729
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,900
We have some laughs,
keep it simple.

730
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,836
Well, has it always
been simple, or has

731
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:51,300
there ever been
anyone complicated?

732
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,500
That's a yes. Yes?

733
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,700
How complicated? Scale
from one to ten.

734
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,700
- Twelve.
- Twelve? God, what happened?

735
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,600
Well, tragically, she, she...

736
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,000
Died? Oh, my God, I'm so...

737
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,099
- No, she didn't die.
- I'm so... Oh.

738
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,964
Why... You gonna let me
tell the story or what?

739
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:17,965
Oh, I'm sorry.

740
00:55:17,966 --> 00:55:19,599
Sure. Tell it.

741
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,700
She...

742
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,100
fell in love with somebody else.

743
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,600
Not just somebody
else. My best friend.

744
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,200
My partner. The guy I
was in business with.

745
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,800
God. What did you do?

746
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,700
Well, I, bowed out,
gave them my blessing.

747
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,000
Are they still together?

748
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,400
No. They broke up.

749
00:55:45,501 --> 00:55:48,000
Not before I sold them
my half of the business.

750
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,900
I came out here, got my
plane, never looked back.

751
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,600
Best thing that ever
happened to me.

752
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,100
- There are two boats.
- What? Two boats?

753
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,100
Two boats. Ah.

754
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,100
Look. God, this is great, huh?

755
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,000
Hello.

756
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,200
Hello.

757
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:18,524
Whoo.

758
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:21,000
Sit down. We got to
get out of here.

759
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,000
- Why? Why?
- We got to get out of here.

760
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,611
What? "Get out of here"?
What are you talking about?

761
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:26,800
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

762
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,300
Oh, my God.

763
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,800
- Who are they?
- Pirates.

764
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,300
Pi... Pirates, as in "argh"?

765
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,100
Smugglers. Thieves.

766
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,100
They rob boats.

767
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,000
"Rob... Rob boats"?
They just killed a guy.

768
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,500
They could kill us, too,
just for being here.

769
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
- Just for seeing them.
- What?

770
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,200
- Shit. He just saw me.
- We got company.

771
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,200
- Oh.
- Out, out, out.

772
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,200
Oh, no.

773
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,800
They just lowered a boat.

774
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,600
- What kind of a boat?
- A motorboat.

775
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,800
- Shit, shit.
- Oh.

776
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,100
Whoo-hoo.

777
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,300
Let's go. Move them out.

778
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,100
Oh, God. Row faster.

779
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,100
Go, go, go.

780
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,300
I can't.

781
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,300
Yes, you can.

782
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,800
What? What?

783
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,000
- Go.
- Where? Why?

784
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,400
God. Oh.

785
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,200
Don't.

786
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,200
Let's not make this difficult.

787
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,300
That was a very
stupid thing to do.

788
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,400
Now I'm gonna have to
kill you. Say goodbye.

789
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,900
We've got gold.

790
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,300
Up.

791
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,300
- Gold?
- Gold.

792
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,300
Yeah. We've got gold. I'm
a jewellery designer.

793
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,100
I design jewellery with
gold and precious stones.

794
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,014
Precious stones I-like...

795
01:00:37,015 --> 01:00:40,000
I have... I have sold to
all the finest stores,

796
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,000
and, we've got display
cases on the boat...

797
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,400
because, we're expanding the
business in the Far East...

798
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,500
But that's my husband's
end of the business.

799
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,200
- Cause I'm in marketing. I'm...
- Whiz. You're a whiz.

800
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,000
Take us to the boat.

801
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,400
Hey. Hey.

802
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,500
Come on.

803
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,300
Oh, my God. Now what?

804
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,300
- We go on three.
- Oh.

805
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,000
- One, two...
- I can't. You go. Save yourself.

806
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,100
- I'm sorry.
- For kissing me?

807
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,900
No. For this.

808
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,400
Huh.

809
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,100
Damn. Damn.

810
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,019
You know how some
people say you... you

811
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,300
don't know what you had
until you lose it?

812
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,900
- Mm.
- It's a load of crap.

813
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,400
I knew what I had. I...

814
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,600
God, I loved her...
love her. Love her.

815
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,500
Not to insult you,
but I don't think

816
01:03:26,501 --> 01:03:29,000
men know what love is. I mean...

817
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,000
- I do.
- Yeah?

818
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:32,100
I do.

819
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:34,100
Well, guys... They tell me
they love me all the time.

820
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,700
Well, I'm sure at least
some of them mean it.

821
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,700
No, they don't.

822
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,300
- Do you think they gave up?
- I don't know.

823
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,500
We shouldn't go back to the camp.
The plane's too easy to spot.

824
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,000
I am so scared.

825
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:57,300
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm a little scared myself.

826
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,400
No. No, that does not
make me feel better.

827
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,449
I thought that's
what women wanted.

828
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:03,450
What?

829
01:05:03,451 --> 01:05:05,439
Men who weren't afraid
to cry, who were

830
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,400
in touch with their feminine side.

831
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,373
No, not when they're
being chased by

832
01:05:09,374 --> 01:05:11,400
pirates. They like
them mean and armed.

833
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,200
Whoa.

834
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,100
This is not a good
island for aeroplanes.

835
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,100
It's a Japanese World
War II float plane.

836
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,100
It's been up there for 50 years.

837
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,200
Jesus.

838
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,700
You don't think there's
any way that you could...

839
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:53,300
Nah. Nah.

840
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:57,200
This looks like a safe
place to spend the night.

841
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:02,200
I'm gonna see if there's
anything I can use up there.

842
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,200
Hi.

843
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,300
Hey.

844
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,700
This is me here.

845
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,700
Whoo. We got to meet
them at 6:00 a.m

846
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,900
They're gonna widen the search.

847
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,600
I may be too drunk to
wake up at 6:00 a.m

848
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,000
I know how...

849
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,600
Are you sure you're okay?
You're... You're fine?

850
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,600
Yeah, I'm...

851
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:42,600
I'm just going to... take a
shower and get into bed.

852
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,200
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. Yeah.

853
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:51,400
I mean, do you want
to stay here tonight?

854
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
Stay?

855
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,400
Yeah. With me?

856
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,700
I mean, you probably think I'm
being slutty or something,

857
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,000
but I'm feeling bad and
you're feeling bad...

858
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,600
and I'd really like
for you to stay.

859
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:09,600
I just don't... Yeah.
Sure. Why not?

860
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,300
- Yeah?
- No, no, I can't.

861
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,900
I mean, I'm still
clinging to hope.

862
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,300
And if I mean, if
we... You know...

863
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,700
Holy...

864
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,700
- No.
- No?

865
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:32,800
- No. I...
- Mm. Are you sure?

866
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,200
Oh, yeah.

867
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:41,200
Yeah. No, I seem to
be leaving the room.

868
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,000
Breadfruit.

869
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,000
- It's not bread.
- It's not fruit.

870
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,100
I wanna kiss you.

871
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,600
I really liked kissing you.

872
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,100
I liked kissing you.

873
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,500
But?

874
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:35,500
But if I start, I'm not
gonna be able to stop.

875
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,600
- Sounds good.
- Doesn't it?

876
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,800
I, oh... can't.

877
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,700
We should get some sleep.

878
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,300
Come here.

879
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,100
This feels good...

880
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,100
and safe.

881
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,100
It feels good and safe.

882
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,600
- Good morning.
- Wh... What are you doing?

883
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,300
- I got a plan.
- Good.

884
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,400
Anything I can do to help?

885
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,800
Yeah.

886
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,200
Yeah. Just a second.

887
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,900
What is it? What's wrong?

888
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Angelica, the helicopter
is going up in 20 minutes.

889
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,000
- If you're going, vite, huh?
- Twenty min...

890
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,700
Oh, jeez, I didn't realise it
was... Okay. Thank you, Phillippe.

891
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,000
Tell them I'm on my way, okay? Oh.

892
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,000
The helicopter's going
up in 20 minutes.

893
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,500
Oh, God, what did...
what did I do?

894
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,200
And how many times did I do it?

895
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,449
Are you okay?

896
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,600
Huh? No, no, this was
wrong. This was all wrong.

897
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,400
Excuse me. How could you say that?

898
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,900
N- No. I mean, everything
you did was very right.

899
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,500
But what I did was
wrong. This is wrong.

900
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,199
No, no.

901
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,100
It's just we are going
through a terrible ordeal.

902
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,700
It's like... when
after a funeral...

903
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,500
- Yeah?
- Everybody has sex.

904
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
- Not everybody.
- No?

905
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,000
- No.
- Oh.

906
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,200
What?

907
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,000
Nothing.

908
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,900
You know that woman I
was telling you about?

909
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,100
The heartbreaker?

910
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,700
She was my wife.

911
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,300
- Oh.
- Twelve years.

912
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,800
Do you have any kids?

913
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,200
No, we didn't have
any kids, thank God.

914
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:39,000
But I always wanted
kids. Bunches of them.

915
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:43,000
Really? There's still time.

916
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,500
Look. Come on. How old are you?

917
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,100
Well, what do...

918
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,799
How old do you think I am?

919
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,500
Let me think.

920
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,700
Guess.

921
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,700
Forty-five?

922
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,900
Forty-eight?

923
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,100
Fifty. You 50?

924
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,600
- You still look good.
- I still am good.

925
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:31,400
Let's get these apart. We got
to take them down one by one.

926
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,500
You first.

927
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,500
Careful.

928
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,800
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

929
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,900
- Okay, your turn.
- Eeew.

930
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,400
How can I eat? I'm
scum. I'm garbage.

931
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,821
This experience has
tested me and has

932
01:14:39,822 --> 01:14:41,900
revealed no character whatsoever.

933
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,400
Stop beating yourself up. You're
a guy. You can't help it.

934
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:52,900
Mr Martin, forgive me.

935
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,800
I just heard they decided
to call off the search.

936
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,100
I'm sorry.

937
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,800
But that's it? Wh...

938
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,800
Okay.

939
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,300
It's working.

940
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,700
Keep coming.

941
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,200
Push.

942
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,599
- Ready?
- All right.

943
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,700
Put her down.

944
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,300
- Oh, shit. Look.
- Oh.

945
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,600
Get out of here.

946
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,800
Too far back to the right.

947
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,100
Oh, God. Are you okay?

948
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,100
Oh.

949
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,199
Oh, you're hit.

950
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,300
It's not bad.

951
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,500
- It's not bad.
- Oh.

952
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:45,100
Come on. Come on.

953
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,500
I'm in. I'm in. Get
in the plane. Hurry.

954
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,000
Hurry.

955
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,300
Hurry, hurry up.

956
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,700
Hurry.

957
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,400
Okay. Come on. Come on.

958
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Fire.

959
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,300
Damn. Get out of my way.

960
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,700
Reload.

961
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,400
Take off.

962
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,200
Take off.

963
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,300
We're gonna hit them.

964
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,700
We're gonna hit them.

965
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,700
Give me a hand. Pull.

966
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,100
- Pull, pull.
- Pull.

967
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,900
Let's do it.

968
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,800
Hit the...

969
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,700
Come on. Come on.
Stay with me here.

970
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,200
Stay with me. You're doing great.

971
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,200
Come on.

972
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:52,200
Look, I should tell you a few
things about aeroplanes.

973
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,300
Why is that?

974
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,559
Because I may not
be conscious when

975
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,600
it comes time to land this thing.

976
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,600
Oh, shit.

977
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,600
Take the controls. I want you
to get a feel for the yoke.

978
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,500
You're serious, aren't you?

979
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,400
I got it. Okay.

980
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,400
- Okay.
- Okay, sw... Hey.

981
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,400
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Small corrections.

982
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,500
- Sorry.
- Small corrections.

983
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,400
- Small.
- Just look at the horizon.

984
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,900
When we get there,
you're gonna line up...

985
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,500
about a hundred feet
out from the beach.

986
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,400
A hundred feet out from the beach.

987
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,500
We are here today...

988
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,770
to honour two fine
people: Miss Robin

989
01:22:58,771 --> 01:23:00,600
Monroe and an old friend, Mr...

990
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,799
Father, please forgive
me, for I have sinned.

991
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,500
I've been bad, very bad.

992
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:22,800
Oh, God. Quinn?

993
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,800
Quinn, don't make
me do this alone.

994
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:29,800
Please, Quinn, don't make
me do this alone. Shit.

995
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,200
I would say a few words about
our friend, Quinn Harris.

996
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:43,900
He was the kind of man who...

997
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,800
It's Quinny. It's Quinny.

998
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,500
Look.

999
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,600
All right. Lined
up with the beach.

1000
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:11,500
Throttle to 65 knots.

1001
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,500
What the hell's a knot?

1002
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,700
It's Quinny. Look.

1003
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,800
- Oh.
- Thank... Thank you, God.

1004
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,200
Flaps. Flaps, flaps.

1005
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,900
Okay. All right.

1006
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,100
Nose slightly elevated
for landing. Here we go.

1007
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,300
And, help me, God.

1008
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,800
Oh, my God.

1009
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,000
I'm coming, sweetie.

1010
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,500
Hurry. Hurry.

1011
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,500
Oh. Quinn.

1012
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,499
Quinn. Quinn, Quinn.

1013
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,300
Oh. Hey.

1014
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,100
We did it.

1015
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:26,000
I'm coming, Robin.

1016
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,800
Sweetie, hold...

1017
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,800
- Robin. Oh, my God, you're alive.
- Hey, Frank.

1018
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,000
- Wh... You're hurt. You're hurt.
- No, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.

1019
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,162
He needs a doctor. Get
him... Get him a doctor.

1020
01:25:38,163 --> 01:25:40,000
A doctor. We need a doctor.

1021
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,600
Come on. Come on, sweetie.

1022
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,300
- Quinny, are you okay, baby?
- Can you move your leg?

1023
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,300
Be careful. Are you okay, baby?

1024
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:56,700
- Be careful.
- Steady, steady, steady.

1025
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,900
They brought the tea.

1026
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,600
- Oh, great.
- Do you want some honey, sweetie?

1027
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,700
Sure.

1028
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,748
The guy said the, hotel's offered

1029
01:26:19,749 --> 01:26:21,800
us a month's free
stay anytime we want.

1030
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:25,900
Oh. They're probably
afraid I'm gonna sue them.

1031
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,224
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

1032
01:26:30,225 --> 01:26:31,225
Oh, yeah.

1033
01:26:31,226 --> 01:26:33,500
I'm just, you know, tired.

1034
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,600
Ooh. Ah.

1035
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,400
There we go. I'm sorry.

1036
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,600
Are you okay?

1037
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,799
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep.

1038
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,200
Frank. Come here. Come here.

1039
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:52,200
Sit down.

1040
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:57,800
It was terrible.

1041
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:00,500
I mean...

1042
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,700
I think deep down, I never
expected to see you again.

1043
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,400
You know? I was... I was lost.

1044
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,500
I was...

1045
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:15,800
We're just people, you
know? You know, Robin?

1046
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:19,800
We're not perfect. I mean,
under that kind of pressure...

1047
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,899
I mean, people do
things, you know? I

1048
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,800
mean, you don't know
right and wrong.

1049
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,400
You're cra... You're
nuts. You know, you...

1050
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,000
Hi.

1051
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,800
Oh, hi.

1052
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,200
Keeping busy?

1053
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,200
Yeah.

1054
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:09,700
- How are you?
- Good. Good, thanks.

1055
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,700
This is... not so bad.
How about you... your...

1056
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,100
- It's fine.
- Good.

1057
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:22,300
What's the deal here?

1058
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,600
Deal?

1059
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,300
With us?

1060
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:35,400
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

1061
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:47,800
Was what happened on
that island anything?

1062
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:51,400
Or was it just something that
happens to two people...

1063
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,300
when they're alone on
an island together?

1064
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,900
It was something.

1065
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,200
- "Something"?
- Yeah.

1066
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,400
So...

1067
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,399
now what?

1068
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:16,200
Look, I'm pretty set
in my ways, and...

1069
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,800
you got all kinds
of possibilities.

1070
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:22,200
You deserve someone...

1071
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,200
fresher.

1072
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,600
Don't you think that's
up to me to decide?

1073
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,600
Let's be smart about this.

1074
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,000
You're not gonna move out
here and become my copilot,

1075
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:41,400
and I'm not gonna go to New York
and be your receptionist, so...

1076
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,800
Where does that leave us?

1077
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,800
I don't know. I guess
it leaves us nowhere.

1078
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:53,100
So let's not complicate things.

1079
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:57,000
Oh, I forgot you
like things simple.

1080
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,000
- Right.
- Right.

1081
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,500
Well, good luck.

1082
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,100
Good luck to you too.

1083
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:26,200
I hope everything
works out... for you.

1084
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,000
So how's that shoulder today?

1085
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,300
Need something for the pain?

1086
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,800
Yeah.

1087
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:07,300
Well, 14 more hours,
then back to reality.

1088
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,000
Frank?

1089
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,500
I don't think we
should get married.

1090
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,800
What?

1091
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:22,000
How come?

1092
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,500
Because I think it's
wrong for two people...

1093
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,100
to get married when something
is hanging over their heads.

1094
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:34,400
Oh, God, I'm sorry. Robin,
I'm sorry. I was... I was...

1095
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,422
I was distraught,
and then she took

1096
01:31:36,423 --> 01:31:38,400
off her blouse. I
was, "Oh, my God."

1097
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,900
But I walked away. I did.
I went back to our room.

1098
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,900
I tried to go to sleep, but I
thought of you. I thought...

1099
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,500
Oh, I didn't know if
you were dead or what.

1100
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:50,300
So I went back to her bungalow,
you know, just to... and she...

1101
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,700
Robin, she answered
the door with...

1102
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:56,300
On.

1103
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,300
- Who?
- Angelica.

1104
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,900
You slept with Angelica?

1105
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,700
Who slept? Are you ki...

1106
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,800
Didn't you know?

1107
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,500
How would I know?

1108
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,800
Wait a minute. You just said there
was something hanging over our...

1109
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,600
What do you... Wh...
What do you mean?

1110
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,800
Quinn and me.

1111
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,700
Aha.

1112
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,100
Oh, Frank, something happened.

1113
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,354
Something happened
that shouldn't have

1114
01:32:24,355 --> 01:32:26,400
happened if you and
I were really...

1115
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,400
In love.

1116
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:55,200
Flight number 38 to Honolulu,

1117
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,400
all ticketed passengers
should board immediately.

1118
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,500
Bon voyage, madame.

1119
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,100
Monsieur? Bon voyage.

1120
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,300
Madame?

1121
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,100
Bon voyage.

1122
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,200
Monsieur?

1123
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,300
Hey.

1124
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,800
Sorry.

1125
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:51,800
Hey.

1126
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,100
Hey-Hey.

1127
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,200
Where's the p...
plane to New York?

1128
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,200
Right there.

1129
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,900
I'm sorry. I just had
to get off the plane.

1130
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,500
I... Well, I'm sorry I
delayed the flight.

1131
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,500
Listen. I just wanted...

1132
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,400
I don't speak any French. I just
needed to get off the plane.

1133
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,400
Where are all my bags?

1134
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,800
You don't speak any? Neither one
of you speak any English at all?

1135
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
What's in my bags is illegal?

1136
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,300
W- Wait a minute. Oh, please
don't search my bags.

1137
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,700
It's just important
that I stay h...

1138
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:19,500
- You're here.
- Bonjour, Quinn.

1139
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,500
Mon ami. Merci.

1140
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:33,000
Why... Why did you
get off the plane?

1141
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,900
Wha... Why didn't you...
Why did you come here?

1142
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,100
I've decided my life
is... too simple.

1143
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,900
- It is?
- Yeah.

1144
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,900
I wanna... wanna complicate
the hell out of it.

1145
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,500
So, where are we going?

1146
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,500
Your place is in New York, right?

1147
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,600
Huh.

1148
01:36:11,601 --> 01:36:13,299
I don't think I can
wait that long.

1149
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,300
How about my place?

1150
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,400
Oh, yeah. Your little
house on the beach.

1151
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,600
More like a shack, actually.

1152
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:22,500
- A shack?
- It's, It's not much.

1153
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:25,600
Huh. You do have a bed, don't you?

1154
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:28,000
