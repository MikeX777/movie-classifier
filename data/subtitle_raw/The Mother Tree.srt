00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:25,858
What brought you back from
near-bankruptcy three years ago...

9
00:01:26,037 --> 00:01:28,232
...is your ability.

10
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:33,006
It has nothing to do with
that simple painting of mine.

11
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,168
No, Shigenobu-sensei.

12
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:39,146
That is the brushwork of
the greatest artist in Edo.

13
00:01:39,317 --> 00:01:43,720
Look how enticingly
her hair hangs.

14
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:46,683
It is a masterpiece.

15
00:01:47,558 --> 00:01:48,855
It's not that good!

16
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,463
Indeed it is! This establishment
has prospered...

17
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:56,759
...on customers
wishing to view it.

18
00:01:57,568 --> 00:02:03,006
If he is to paint for you,
have him do something colorful.

19
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:05,203
Fireworks, perhaps.

20
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,872
Fireworks on a temple
folding-screen?

21
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,911
Well, Sensei?

22
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:14,210
Perhaps a "sumi" ink painting...

23
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:17,417
...of the married dragons.

24
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,551
The progenitors of humanity...

25
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,554
Yes, Sensei, please!

26
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:39,439
I'll express what I've come
since my marriage to feel.

27
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:43,774
I very much hope
you will do that.

28
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:45,813
Excuse me.

29
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,910
Thank you for waiting.

30
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,918
The boat's ready.

31
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:58,661
Your man Shosuke insists
on poling it himself!

32
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,313
Look, Mayotaro...it's done.

33
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:21,543
This is for you.

34
00:03:23,254 --> 00:03:25,051
He's asleep!

35
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:01,183
Look.

36
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:08,725
There's Takeroku up there.

37
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,267
Takeroku? That nice young lad?

38
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:17,965
I said I'd paint something for him
and I haven't even touched a brush!

39
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,512
Land us at the bridge.

40
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,412
Yes, sir.

<i>"Cold Dumplings"</i>

42
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:34,981
Don't worry. I'll do if for you.

43
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:40,290
That would be wonderful, sir!
Thank you very much!

44
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:43,456
We'll be looking for you
to come by.

45
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,068
Thank you!

46
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:52,103
I'll look forward to it.

47
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,034
Whoops! Careful on the stones,
Missus!

48
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,181
Don't drop the baby!

49
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,856
A pretty woman!

50
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,788
Namihei! Were you here
all along?

51
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,126
I couldn't take my eyes off her!

52
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,660
As usual, eh?

53
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,994
Who was that man
you were with?

54
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,435
Hishikawa Shigenobu.

55
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,838
A famous Tosa
and ukiyoe painter.

56
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,069
I see...

57
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:33,907
What is it?

58
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:40,651
I like painting. I'd like to find
someone good to learn from.

59
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:45,962
Could you help me become
a student of his?

60
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:52,033
I couldn't do that!
Not even for a friend.

61
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:58,208
My master dismissed me because
I was too interested in painting.

62
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:01,106
Yes, but still...

63
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:03,069
Wait!

64
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:06,411
I'm sure you can do something.

65
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,749
Are you sure you can't help?

66
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,080
But...

67
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:15,055
I know it's not much.
Don't be so damn proper!

68
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,917
I see...

69
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:19,590
All right, Namihei.

70
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,932
Taking so long over this...
I must be losing my touch!

71
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:37,447
You have too much to do.

72
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:43,445
The Nanzoin Temple has asked
again when you will come.

73
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:48,615
How long has it been
since I said I'd go there?

74
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:53,156
All right, I'll go now.

75
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:57,329
Tell Shosuke
to get my things ready.

76
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:59,868
I will.

77
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:05,373
It's such a help to have
a student like Namihei here.

78
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,841
He's very nice, isn't he.

79
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:12,039
The baby always likes
Namihei to hold him.

80
00:07:12,216 --> 00:07:15,344
Did he buy you that comb?

81
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,048
Well, this is goodbye for a while.

82
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:21,818
There's my boy!

83
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,755
Be good till I get back.

84
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:28,928
Are you leaving now?

85
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,592
Yes. But don't worry.
I'll be back soon.

86
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,739
But I'll miss you...

87
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:41,674
Getting this job done
will be a load off my shoulders.

88
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,509
Take care of things.

89
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:45,838
I will.

90
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:52,519
I leave the women
of my house in your care.

91
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:57,724
Have no fear. Put your heart
into your work.

92
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:02,457
Kise, if there are any problems,
discuss them with Namihei.

93
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:06,395
Take good care of the boy.

94
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:15,073
Take care of your health,
and come home soon.

95
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:16,804
Don't worry.

96
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:18,545
Dear...

97
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:20,616
I'll be going.

98
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:53,907
Make yourself at home, Takeroku.
It's always a pleasure to see you.

99
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:56,550
No, we should go.

100
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:02,416
I feel guilty about being received
so well with your husband away.

101
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:06,525
I'm not saying this
just to be polite...

102
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:11,058
but I can't imagine leaving
such a pretty wife alone...

103
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:15,863
to go to some country temple
and paint!

104
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:19,097
Don't prattle that way!

105
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:19,933
But...

106
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,440
That's all right.

107
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:26,704
I'm very grateful
to Takeroku.

108
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,678
And why would that be?

109
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:36,984
It's because of him
we have a student like you.

110
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:40,358
You embarrass me.

111
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:44,388
Takeroku, it's getting late.
We should go.

112
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:48,866
But you've come all this way
to see that we're all right!

113
00:09:49,037 --> 00:09:51,471
With the Sensei away...

114
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,541
...it's unseemly for us
to be here too long.

115
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:55,698
Oh, no!

116
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:57,811
It's time to go.

117
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,949
What's wrong?!

118
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:15,528
I'm sorry...I sometimes
have these spasms...

119
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:16,925
Does it hurt?

120
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:21,000
Please...bring me a cup
of hot water...quickly!

121
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,501
Just lay quietly.

122
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:24,697
Hana!

123
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,257
One more thing...

124
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:52,526
Move that in here.

125
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:01,805
What are you doing?!

126
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,744
Keep quiet!

127
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:06,641
Stop that!

128
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:10,950
I'll scream if you don't stop!

129
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,518
Go ahead.

130
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,119
I wasn't sick.

131
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:23,090
I think about you all the time.
I dream about you!

132
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,892
What do you want?

133
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:29,400
I love you more than
I love life itself!

134
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:33,837
This is wrong! Let go of me!

135
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,070
You mustn't!

136
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:37,336
Kise!

137
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:39,445
No! Let go!

138
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,955
If you refuse, I'll kill you
then kill myself!

139
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:59,856
If you want me so much,
then take me

140
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:03,664
and then kill me.

141
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:07,674
I'm a married woman.

142
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:11,143
This cannot be!

143
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:23,446
Then I'll take this child with us!

144
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:26,324
Wait!

145
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:30,998
Then you accept that it's my fate
to risk my life for love of you?

146
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:32,531
This is unfair!

147
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:38,805
To force yourself on a weak woman
by using an innocent babe...

148
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:42,239
...is cowardice worse than villainy!

149
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:47,748
Call me villain or call me demon,
I will pleasure you!

150
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,242
Shigenobu!

151
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,854
Be too much in the mind
and the body pays.

152
00:13:04,632 --> 00:13:06,099
Your Reverence...

153
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:10,169
I don't know if it will help,
but have some tea.

154
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:35,762
I sent Hana on an errand.

155
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:38,532
We won't be disturbed.

156
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,296
You're nothing but a beast
in human form!

157
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:46,201
And now you're my mate!

158
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:53,314
You're an adulteress.
We're animals together.

159
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:55,878
You disgust me!

160
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,382
Ye Gods, forgive me!

161
00:13:58,553 --> 00:14:02,512
As you wish.
Now, while we have time...

162
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,318
Take your hands off me!

163
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:19,500
The Sensei's coming home?!

164
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:27,280
I thought he'd be there
for weeks!

165
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:29,548
Kise!

166
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:32,653
No!

167
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:44,464
What do you think you're doing?!

168
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:47,362
You saw us!

169
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:18,662
You!

170
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:22,468
I don't know anything!
I swear I'll say nothing...

171
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:24,662
...about the two of you!

172
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,897
"Two"?

173
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:27,598
No, I mean...

174
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:30,704
You said "two"!

175
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,278
Please!

176
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:34,244
So you know!

177
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,211
I can't leave you alive
when you know our secret!

178
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:41,252
I know nothing!

179
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:45,085
Then will you do as I tell you?

180
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,451
I'm just an old...

181
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:49,893
Will you?

182
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,122
Well?

183
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:56,793
Yes! Whatever you say!

184
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,884
Some rich food is welcome
after so long a time.

185
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:20,086
I thought fish might be welcome
after weeks of temple life.

186
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:24,027
What do you think?
I've put my heart into it.

187
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,574
You'd think they were alive.

188
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,539
All that's left is the eyes.

189
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:40,477
I want eyes that might see
right into the next world!

190
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:48,345
But perhaps, Sensei,
you're working too hard.

191
00:16:48,656 --> 00:16:51,216
I was speaking of this
to Shosuke.

192
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:55,692
Perhaps you might go
to see the fireflies at Ochiai.

193
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:57,990
Go out and wander around?

194
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:02,830
Yes. Good health requires
occasional rest.

195
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:04,829
Is that not so?

196
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:09,437
I've heard the fireflies
at Ochiai are a wonderful sight.

197
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,977
Shosuke, come with me.

198
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,581
I will.

199
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,606
I follow you, Sensei.

200
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:45,369
What?

201
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:46,774
Nothing.

202
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,522
Who are you?

203
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,797
What are you waiting for?

204
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,129
But...

205
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:12,602
Fool! Get going!

206
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:23,612
You!

207
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:24,978
Yes! Namihei!

208
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:29,451
You're an inconvenience.
So if you'll excuse me...

209
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:34,054
Have you gone mad?!

210
00:18:34,728 --> 00:18:35,558
You fool!

211
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:38,795
Why would you hate me?

212
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:40,228
Tell me why!

213
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:43,336
Silence, dead man!

214
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,399
You'll pay for this!

215
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:48,769
To hell with you!

216
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:58,309
You'll pay!

217
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,446
Though you kill me
I will not die...

218
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:07,489
while my dragons
have no eyes!

219
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:23,036
Stubborn bastard!

220
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:04,549
Mayotaro!

221
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:18,488
<i>Hello!</i>

222
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:24,166
I thought this might happen.

223
00:20:24,705 --> 00:20:27,606
You've gone and done it now!

224
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:29,765
You saw me!

225
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:32,605
I wouldn't do that!

226
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:37,940
The watch is to be told
if I don't happen to come back.

227
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:03,001
Why are you drinking
all that water?

228
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:04,905
What's happened to you?

229
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:10,113
It was horrible!

230
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:13,947
The Sensei was attacked
by thieves!

231
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:16,045
He's dead!

232
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,919
What nonsense is this?

233
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:23,893
Shigenobu came back here

234
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:27,496
and went straight to work!

235
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:31,101
It can't be!

236
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:10,040
Shosuke, what do you see?

237
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:17,875
Shosuke!

238
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:21,716
What's wrong?

239
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,255
<i>Help!</i>

240
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:29,417
Your Reverence!

241
00:22:38,205 --> 00:22:39,502
Your Reverence!

242
00:22:39,673 --> 00:22:40,799
What's the matter?

243
00:22:40,974 --> 00:22:44,000
We found the Sensei
under Ochiai Bridge!

244
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:45,075
What?

245
00:22:53,854 --> 00:22:57,790
His spirit yet wanders
among us...

246
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:08,363
"May his soul rest in peace."

247
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:16,838
I'll arrange a proper wedding.
Please say you'll marry me.

248
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:20,444
Please, Kise...

249
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:26,210
Kise! This has gone far enough!

250
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:30,787
We've lain together!
Where's the harm in it?

251
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:36,421
Soon people will stop talking,
and forget the Sensei.

252
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:38,029
Never!

253
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,657
You'll submit to me!

254
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,927
No! Don't touch me!

255
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:46,871
You'll do as I say,
even if I have to use force!

256
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,665
I loathe you!

257
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,536
Oh, you do?

258
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,201
Then I have nothing to lose!

259
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:57,207
Shut up!

260
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,954
Put that damn child to sleep!

261
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:08,622
With his father dead,
my milk has dried up.

262
00:24:10,397 --> 00:24:12,888
The poor thing!

263
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:27,831
What do you want?

264
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:33,603
Girls...

265
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:35,543
Enjoy yourselves.

266
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:41,380
You know what I want.

267
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:47,417
You scratch my back, and I
scratch yours. Need I say more?

268
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,457
How much are you going to
wring out of me?

269
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:54,225
Don't tell me you've forgotten!

270
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:57,603
I mean, if I were to...

271
00:25:57,804 --> 00:26:00,034
That's enough! Have a drink.

272
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:01,901
Really?

273
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:07,274
Good! I don't talk this way
because I like to, you know.

274
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:08,744
Let me pour you one.

275
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:17,657
Anyway, squire...
I'm a little short again.

276
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:18,984
What?

277
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,560
If it's a problem,
don't worry.

278
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:27,257
I would have asked earlier,
but you were busy...

279
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:28,432
Enough!

280
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:32,868
Don't ask me here.
Come with me to the house.

281
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,768
I'll give you something then.

282
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:38,666
Well, I'm certainly glad
to hear that!

283
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:07,436
I've made some broth
for the little boy.

284
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:09,602
Thank you.

285
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:17,248
I could never find a wet-nurse
for him this late at night.

286
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:24,280
Missus, even during the day...

287
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:27,421
We've been refused?

288
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:31,689
I've searched all over,
asked everywhere...

289
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:35,265
but because of the way
the Sensei passed on...

290
00:27:35,801 --> 00:27:40,101
...all the wet-nurses are afraid.

291
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:41,670
I see...

292
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:54,082
If it goes on like this,
he'll die...

293
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:57,583
My poor baby!

294
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:02,323
Forgive me!

295
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:58,373
<i>Rokusho Shrine</i>

296
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:44,688
<i>The Mother Tree</i>

297
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:54,365
Give him to me.

298
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:30,768
Dear!

299
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:35,805
I don't care what happens to me.

300
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:41,920
I'll raise Mayotaro
so he may take revenge.

301
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:46,022
For that...

302
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:50,124
...I will live through any shame.

303
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:54,825
Until that day, forgive my sins!

304
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,936
When that day comes
I will appear.

305
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:01,402
Only then will I be able
to paint

306
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:06,101
the eyes of the twin dragons.

307
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,544
Dear!

308
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:43,806
Spirits!

309
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:46,347
Come back!

310
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:48,850
What's going on?

311
00:31:56,495 --> 00:32:00,056
What's the Missus
doing out here now?

312
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:01,426
Kise?

313
00:32:03,235 --> 00:32:04,065
You!

314
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:08,466
Fiend!

315
00:32:10,843 --> 00:32:13,209
I can't do a thing like that!

316
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,744
Oh, stop whining!

317
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:22,045
I'll tell Kise he'll stay with
a family in your village.

318
00:32:22,221 --> 00:32:26,351
I owe the Sensei gratitude!
I can't do that to his son!

319
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:29,153
It's cold-blooded murder!

320
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:31,259
The Sensei again?

321
00:32:31,597 --> 00:32:35,795
Who helped kill that Sensei
you owe so much to?

322
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:40,733
We can both be crucified
for that!

323
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:41,964
Please!

324
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,841
I just can't do it!

325
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:46,943
Quiet!

326
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:55,213
You'll do as I say if you value
your life! Do you hear me?!

327
00:32:56,989 --> 00:32:59,958
<i>"Come to the Mother Tree."</i>

328
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:03,826
<i>"The Mother Tree."</i>

329
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:05,591
Well?

330
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,897
I'll do it.

331
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,969
But please, ask no more of me!

332
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:20,337
I can't do that.
You're tied to me for life!

333
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:34,289
You're really taking him to
the best family in the village?

334
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:37,394
Fool! Don't you trust Shosuke?

335
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:38,621
But...

336
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:42,528
Shosuke's gone to
a lot of trouble over this!

337
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,304
Why are you crying?

338
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,673
He'll be much better off
with a healthy village wet-nurse.

339
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,207
Won't he?

340
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,746
Missus, I...

341
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:07,252
Well, Shosuke...

342
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:08,524
Yes?

343
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,322
Take good care of my boy.

344
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:14,732
Have no fear, Missus.

345
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:17,695
Tell them if anything happens...

346
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:24,999
that I'll hurry right there.

347
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,312
I'll be on my way, then.

348
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:36,450
You will?

349
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:48,228
I do this from fear of him.

350
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:53,594
Please don't hate me, child.

351
00:34:54,573 --> 00:34:59,101
That Namihei is a demon!

352
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:25,327
Mayotaro!

353
00:35:47,993 --> 00:35:52,259
Namihei said to throw you
into that river...

354
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:56,095
...but I know I heard
Hana's voice.

355
00:35:57,469 --> 00:36:01,735
Pardon me, boy...
I'll leave you here.

356
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,271
Well, Shosuke? Did you do it?

357
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:46,679
Yes, I did.

358
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,351
You drowned him?

359
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:51,216
I did.

360
00:36:52,024 --> 00:36:53,821
Well done, Shosuke.

361
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:57,289
Now I take leave of you.

362
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:58,554
You what?

363
00:37:20,185 --> 00:37:21,049
Who are you?

364
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:17,899
We're leaving!

365
00:39:18,203 --> 00:39:20,728
I can't go just like that!

366
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:25,767
Do you want to see your boy
or not?! Get ready!

367
00:39:25,944 --> 00:39:27,571
My boy?

368
00:39:27,746 --> 00:39:31,648
Stop wasting time!
We're going to see him!

369
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:33,250
Really?

370
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:07,737
That's Mayotaro!

371
00:41:07,913 --> 00:41:11,041
Fool! Mayotaro's dead!

372
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:14,114
What? But you said...

373
00:41:14,853 --> 00:41:18,050
That was to get you
away from Edo with me!

374
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:20,755
You killed Mayotaro!

375
00:41:21,693 --> 00:41:23,718
It wasn't me!

376
00:41:23,995 --> 00:41:25,986
Villain! Fiend!

377
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:39,567
Mayotaro!

378
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:06,596
I'll go to hell for this child...

379
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:10,265
before I let anyone kill him!

380
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:28,710
<i>Yes, Namihei! Go mad!</i>

381
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:30,946
<i>Go mad!</i>

382
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,387
<i>Fall into hell!</i>

383
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,027
<i>Go mad!</i>

384
00:44:09,761 --> 00:44:13,629
<i>Missus...</i>

385
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:35,618
<i>You have done well, Kise.</i>

386
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:39,946
Now I arise

387
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:45,662
to paint in the dragons' eyes.

388
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:53,494
I leave Mayotaro in your care.

389
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,006
Dear!

390
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:15,787
Dear!

391
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,718
What are you doing here?

392
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:31,526
The dragons have eyes!

393
00:46:33,004 --> 00:46:36,997
His spirit is with us!

394
00:46:37,742 --> 00:46:42,645
Shigenobu will watch over him!

395
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:51,183
Take good care...

396
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:56,424
...of my boy.

397
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:00,154
Rest with Buddha!

398
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:23,386
<i>The End</i>
