and from Miami beach, Judy Brooks.

17
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,146
Will the jinx follow the ball

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,106
even in the middle of the ocean?

19
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,027

24
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,040
Meanwhile on Miami Beach the manager
of the Fountain Blue

25
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,959
and the chief of police have
put their foot down

26
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:11,794
on Sherwood Gates balls until the
murders are solved.

27
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,254
- Go on.

28
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,132
- I was hungry see,
that's all it was.

29
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,635
All I wanted was her purse, but when
I grabbed her hand bag

30
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,304
she came along with it.

31
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,305
How was I supposed to know

32
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,223
she had tied herself to
her hand bag?

33
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,768
- So you dragged the old
lady three blocks?

34
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,269
- It was her or me.

35
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,228
- I see.

36
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,606
And you're 29 and she's 89.

37
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,275
- Well she outweighed me.

38
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,610
- Yeah.

39
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,820
- She had on these rubber
toed shoes you know,

40
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,447
really slowed me down.

41
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,740
She kept dragging her feet

42
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,159
making little tread marks
in the sidewalk.

43
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,035
- Yeah.

44
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,930
- Step out please.

45
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,641
Name? - Fanny Hill.

46
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,728
- Urma Ladoosh.

47
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,398
- Pussy Galore.

48
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,399
- Tiny Tim.

49
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,153
- Peters.

50
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,196
- Peters what?

51
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,324
- Dick Peters, can't you
see I'm a man?

52
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,200
- No shit.

53
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,208
- Dave did you see the
hookers we booked?

54
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,002
Man you wouldn't believe what goes
on with those chicks.

55
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,048
And the incredible thing is,
they like it here.

56
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,299
I mean I don't like it
here and I'm a cop.

57
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,593
- Casey.

58
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:02,344
- Some of them are pretty
good looking broads.

59
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,761
- Casey listen a second.

60
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:04,720
- What?

61
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,306
- Come here.

62
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,849
Have you uh

63
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,519
noticed anything funny
about the chief?

64
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,104
I mean uh,

65
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,315
does anything seem strange
about the way he acts?

66
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,735
- Nah, he's an old dick
from way back.

67
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,737
Probably thinks we're a
couple of snotty kids.

68
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,405
- Naw.

69
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,325
Well I think the chief, is a little
bit on the gay side.

70
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,121
- You think the chief is a
little on the gay side?

71
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,498
Dave you've been in vice
too long baby.

72
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,127
No way, it's time for a
little nappy nap.

73
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,880
He's married with
grandchildren for Christ sakes.

74
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,966
- He's always staring at me Casey,
looking me up and down.

75
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,217
Jesus it's driving me nuts.

76
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,262
- When did it start?

77
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,471
- Week, maybe two weeks ago.

78
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,308
- Nah Dave, you're not getting me
in that kind of scene.

79
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,018
No way.

80
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,895
No way, now forget it.

81
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,110

82
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,113

85
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,160
Great, Trix was just great.

86
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,453
- Do me a favor Dave.

87
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,539

busy right now.

88
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,837

Okay.

96
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,529
Don't go anywhere.

97
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,993
- He likes you Dave.

98
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:50,910
- Shut up.

99
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,370
- Hey can I be your pimp?

100
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,123
- God dammit Casey what
am I going to do?

101
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,083
- Don't do anything, let
him do it all.

102
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,501
- That's not what I mean.

103
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,961

00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,300
but I'm already engaged and

106
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,427
- I don't wanna embarrass
the old guy Cas.

107
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,679
- Well just say Chief,

108
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,639
I don't wanna embarrass you,

109
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,516
but I'm not a fag so freak off.

110
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,976
- You're a great help.

111
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,852
Thanks.

112
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,442
- Good morning Collins.

113
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,652
- Morning Officer Fulton.

114
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,570
- Would you do me a favor please?

115
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,741
- Do a good turn for the lady.

116
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,451
- Yes, if you please.

117
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,411
- You uh, want me to spin?

118
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,537
- Mmhmm.

00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,589
- And for this years model, in
yellow and brown.

120
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,841
- That's very nice, very nice.

121
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,343
- Got a good tush too.

122
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,638
- Pull your pant leg up
will you Collins.

123
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,641
Your pant leg up, just
right up there.

124
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,936
Above the knee please,
above the knee.

125
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,358
Oh that's good.

126
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,735
Terrific legs, terrific legs.

127
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,655
- Let's go back in the office.

128
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,490
- You can put your pant
leg down now.

129
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,283
Very nice, very nice.

130
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,580
- Jesus.

131
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,415
What the hell is going on?

132
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,500
- I don't know, but can I watch?

133
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,254
- Oh you're a real buddy
you know that?

134
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,506
The chief and his right hand man
are giving me the eye.

135
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,383
My world.

136
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,596
The whole world is falling apart,

137
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,598
and you're making jokes.

138
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,976
- Just remember Dave,
the whole world

139
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,811
is a comedy to those who think.

140
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,939
- Oh yeah, well what's
your excuse huh?

141
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:43,856
- Collins? - Yeah?

142
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,274
- Can you come into

143
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,400
the chief's office for a
moment please?

144
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,445
- Yes sir, yes ma'am.

145
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,031
- I wanna know everything Dave.

146
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,282
Don't leave out the dirty parts,

147
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,533
I'm a grown man I can take it.

148
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,494
I even go to R rated movies.

149
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,207
- Come in.

150
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,419
Come in Dave.

151
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:07,839
Sit down.

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,386
Dave, we've got a
proposition to make.

153
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,388
- I figured you'd say that.

154
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,100
- How'd you like a nice big fat
promotion Collins?

155
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,518
- Well uh...

156
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,938
- It could make your career as a
police detective Dave.

157
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,732
- Look Chief, and Officer Fulton,

158
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,611
I'm really uh,

159
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,323
very flattered by all this,

160
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,948
but you see uh,

161
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,536
well there's my girl and uh, and uh,

162
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,247
she's, she's a little jealous,

163
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,251
very jealous in fact and uh,

164
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,212
I don't really think
she'd go for it.

165
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,507
- Well of course not Dave, and
you wouldn't tell her.

166
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,718
- This is a covert operation,
Collins, naturally.

167
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:55,553
- Naturally.

168
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,597
- Now listen to me Dave.

169
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,891
I realize this is a little strange

170
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,310
and sort of sudden and
you're a little tense.

171
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,269
" Me!

172
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,186
Tense!

173
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,856
No, not me Chief, not tense.

174
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,859
- The point is Dave, that when
you've been in a department

175
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,736
as long as I have,

176
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,155
you'll realize that sometimes
methods like this

177
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,073
have to be used.

178
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,410
Now you're not just coming through
for me, or for Fulton,

179
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,288
you're coming through for the
whole department.

180
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,499
- The whole department.

181
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,294
- It's quite an assignment Collins.

182
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,547
- It will make you or break you.

183
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,590
- Yes it will.

184
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:33,674
Yes it will.

185
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,345
- Well Collins, what do you say?

186
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,348
- I'm touched Chief,

187
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,228
touched and flattered as I
said before, in fact

188
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,730
I'm sure the two of you are a
little bit touched too.

189
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,275
But the fact is,

190
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,238
I'm gonna have to bow out Chief.

191
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,447
Over and out.

192
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,118
Take care of yourself Chief.

193
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,746
I'll always remember the two of you
with great fondness.

194
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,749
- Now sit down Collins.

195
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,418
What kind of crap are
you handing me?

196
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,545
I offer you the biggest undercover
assignment of your life

197
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,464
and you're backing out.

198
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,549
- Undercover assignment?

199
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,427
- We want you to investigate

200
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,472
the Artisan Models Ball
homicides Dave.

201
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,309
- The last three winners
of that contest

202
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,353
have been brutally murdered.

203
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,271
Now God knows what weird
perverted mentality

204
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,898
is after these poor kids
but we haven't got

205
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,777
a single lead on him or her,
or whoever it is.

206
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,404
We've got to get a man
on the inside.

207
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,698
And make him come to us.

208
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,200
It's too dangerous to assign a
woman to the case.

209
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,285
- That's a moot point Chief.

210
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,872
There are women who could handle it.

211
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,333
Attractive, intelligent,
motivated women.

212
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,918
- Alright let's not go
through that again.

213
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,711
The point is we need a
man that can pose

214
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,756
as a beauty contestant.

215
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,924
- You want me to pose as a
beauty contestant?

216
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,718
- You'd make a very
attractive young lady.

217
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,763
- With the proper
preparations of course.

218
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,764
- You have just two weeks
to turn yourself

219
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,307
into a pretty girl Dave.

220
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,643
- Two weeks?

221
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,645
- This years Artisan Model Ball
takes place in two weeks.

222
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,690
It'll be held on a luxury
liner the Emerald Seas.

223
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,108
- Two weeks Chief.

224
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,820
- Yes, we've been in contact with a
Mister Gregory Lasalle,

225
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,740
a female impersonator who runs a
charm school here in town.

226
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,826
You're to contact him immediately.

227
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,202
Now he won't know
you're a policeman.

228
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,703
He'll think you're just a

229
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,623
just a young man who
wants to learn to be

230
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,501
a female impersonator.

231
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,544
- I see.

232
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,462
- Casey will be working
right along with you.

233
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,757
On the boat he'll pose as your
escort or your boyfriend.

234
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,634
- Escort Chief.

235
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,885
He's not my type for a boyfriend.

236
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,720
- Whatever the choice is yours.

237
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,598
- I think I should go and bring
his escort in Chief,

238
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,183
don't you? - Mmhmm.

239
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,482
That is Sherwood P Gates Ill,

240
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:56,859
he's the originator and one of the

241
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,195
chief sponsors of the ball.

242
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,405
Now despite his benevolent exterior,

243
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,534
he's a notorious playboy, has
been for a long time.

244
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,496
Now it's known, that he
propositioned the three dead girls

245
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,708
and that all three
rejected his advances.

246
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,336
This is Vito Vito and his
bodyguard Paco the Paranoid,

247
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,464
known underworld figures,

248
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,468
who've built a local empire
smuggling cocaine and heroine.

249
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,845
And this is Vito's sister Rita.

250
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,972
Now Rita has been trying to enter

251
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,768
the Artisan Models Beauty Ball
Contest for three years,

252
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,771
and every year she's been rejected.

253
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,232
Now we know that Vito does not want
her to enter the contest

254
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,110
but what we don't know is why.

255
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,155
- Doesn't seem like we have very
much to go on does it?

256
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,947
- The main question is,

257
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,993
why would Gates, or Paco, or Vito

258
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,828
kill the beauty contestants?

259
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,873
- That's what you'll
have to find out.

260
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,791
Remember Paco is the one to watch.

261
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,754
He didn't earn his nickname Paco the
Paranoid for nothing.

262
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,090
He's takes exception to every
side long glance.

263
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,842
Even harmless remarks.

264
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,510
He's been known to assault people

265
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,929
who ask him for directions.

266
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:08,931
- Any questions?

267
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,474
- Yeah.

268
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,935
What do I do while he's learning
how to act like lady?

269
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,019
- You'll be bugging the
apartments of

270
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,189
Sherwood Gates and Vito Vito.

271
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,566
- But Chief
that's such a drag.

272
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,820
- I'm up for a promotion.

273
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,029
You know what that means?

274
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,239
- It means we can get married?

275
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,532
- Right.

276
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,450
Except that before I get
the promotion,

277
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,911
I have this little assignment.

278
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,705
It's just a little undercover
work that I have to do.

279
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,834
It'll take a couple of weeks and uh

280
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:40,171
during that time I won't be able to
write you or phone you

281
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,881
but I want you to know

282
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,342
you'll be in my thoughts
the whole time.

283
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:49,137
And after the assignment, when I
get the promotion,

284
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,556
well,

285
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,849
look out baby.

286
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,609
Why are ya looking at me like that?

287
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,110
- Like what?

288
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,447
- You have a kind of suspicious
look around your eyes.

289
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,991
- Oh I'm not suspicious Dave.

290
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,451
I trust you.

291
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,578
I understand about your work.

292
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,831
I know you have to go away
for weeks at a time.

293
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,417
I know you can't write or phone.

294
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,252
I know you're involved in
dangerous assignments

295
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,921
that could cost you your life.

296
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,674
I understand all that.

297
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm not suspicious.

298
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,220
There's only one thing I wanna know.

299
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:30,096
- What?

300
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,014
- Who is she?

301
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:41,941
- Lesson number one,

302
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,111
you must regard yourself
as a creation.

303
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,781
Not a freak, to be a good
female impersonator.

304
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,952
Creation begins with mist
and ends with mass,

305
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,454
the intangible given a name.

306
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,707
What will your name be Dave?

307
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,043
- How about Gertrude?

308
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,503
- How about Faith?

309
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,588
- <i>l'll</i> buy it.

310
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,923
- Faith Cummings.

311
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,426
- Not bad.

312
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,511
- Then you must think
Faith Cummings.

313
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,972
Eat Faith Cummings.

314
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,099
Breathe Faith Cummings.

315
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,684
Sleep Faith Cummings.

316
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,521
And most importantly you must
believe Faith Cummings.

317
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:21,856
Can you believe?

318
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,274
- I think so.

319
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,776
- Then you've got the Faith.

320
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,696
Alright now move with more grace.

321
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,992
Let your hips sway from
side to side.

322
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,370
That's it, watch your left hand on
your hip, that's it.

323
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,581
Now slowly turn around,
turn around slowly.

324
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,002
Oh my God Faith, you look like a
victim of an Apache Raid.

325
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,046
You don't believe faith believe.

326
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,047
- I believe, I believe.

327
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,717
- Walk don't talk.

328
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,385
That's it, that's it.

329
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,513
Now let those hips sway
very very gingerly.

330
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,181
Oh you're moving so well.

331
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,600
That's my boy.

332
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,144
That's it turn around very slowly.

333
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,978
Oh just divine, that's good, now
carry on, that's it.

334
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,067
Oh how lovely you're doing it.

335
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,529
Oh you're moving so, you're going to
be the hit of the party

336
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,865
I can just see it, I wish
it were my party.

337
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,284
You're doing it, look at that,
it's alright,

338
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,494
you're doing a beautiful job.

339
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:18,286
Just beautiful.

340
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,132
No, no ,no Faith.

341
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,302
We do not apply makeup as though
it were finger paints.

342
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,179
It's not the same thing,

343
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,058
and we don't slap it on in
great gobs and hunks.

344
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,644
We apply it gingerly.

345
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:42,645
Delicately.

346
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,524
- You know I'm beginning to think

347
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,150
I'm really not cut out for this.

348
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,361
I mean some people are just

349
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,155
innately masculine.

350
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,366
- Put the make up on Faith.

351
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,078
- I mean I think I'm just too,

352
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,121
- Butch.

353
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,081
- Jesus.

354
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,834
- Cut yourself again?

355
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,085
You're going to have so many
bandages under there,

356
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,047
it'll look like the mummy's armpit.

357
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,133
- Funny.

358
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,510
I suppose I have to shave
my chest too huh?

359
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,889
- Well why don't we just pluck it

360
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,225
and save you the aggravation?

361
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,072
- Luchio here.

362
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,198
Talk fast.

363
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,909
- Luchio Mio.

364
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,494
This is Gregory.

365
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,664
- I'm so busy, I'm working
on a masterpiece.

366
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,541
- Yes darling, me too.

367
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,545
Can you do me a favor?

368
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,839
I'm in a terrible rush.

369
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,300
Well I have a young man
in training here,

370
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,844
and we need a bosom for him.

371
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,181
Well I know the marvelous
work you're doing,

372
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,141
and I wonder,

373
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,017
what size?

374
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:47,436
What size Faith?

375
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,272
- About a 38.

376
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,357
<i>~</i> 38?

377
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,818
<i>~</i> 38?

378
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,236
Just a minute.

379
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,197
Suzy would you stand up please.

380
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,991
And turn around.

381
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:01,867
Thank you.

382
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,287
- Oh God.

383
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,872
That's so gosh.

384
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,249
Send over a 36.

385
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,753
- I'm working on 36 right now,

386
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,630
you can have them in the morning.

387
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:15,756
Alright?

388
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,509
- Oh thank you so very much.

389
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,135
Kisses to Tiny.

390
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,678
Righto.

391
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:22,554
<i>BYE bye.</i>

392
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,350
<i>38'?</i>

393
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,226
Really?

394
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,937
What do you want, some
kind of freak?

395
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,942
Alright darling, it's
visual aids time.

396
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,700
I have some pictures that I
want to show you.

397
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,327
Here that's it, spread this out.

398
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,204
Here see?

399
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,041
- What are these for?

400
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,795
- Oh these are for the most
important part of the test.

401
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,213
- I don't get it?

402
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,923
- The most important thing Faith

403
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,051
is you see the world
through female eyes.

404
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,553
You see a handsome man for instance.

405
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,180
- Oh no you don't, uh uh.

406
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,099
- It's acting Faith,
that's all it is.

407
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,269
You don't have to really be
turned on by the guy.

408
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,564
You have to allow for the
possibility to enter your head.

409
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,024
- Oh he can enter the head

410
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,192
but everywhere else is off limits.

411
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,152
- Look at these pictures.

412
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,157
Now is there a man here that
looks attractive to you?

413
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,369
Is there one that gives you
just a little tingle?

414
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,206
- He's not bad.

415
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,418
He's no good.

416
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,504
- He's attractive.

417
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,297
- He's kinda cute.

418
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,633
I mean uh...

419
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,093
- Does he give you just a
little tingle?

420
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,388
- Not me, but if I were a broad,

421
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,347
he might.

422
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,849
- Well stretch your imagination.

423
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,686
Imagine you're on a date with him.

424
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,645
Alright now come on now.

425
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,355
Now close your eyes, alright,

426
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,107
try to picture it,

427
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,400
that's it.

428
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,360
Alright now, he knocks at the door.

429
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,654
What then?

430
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,740
- I let him in and introduce him
to my mommy and daddy.

431
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,618
Oh. - What's his name?

432
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,039
- Something ordinary like,

433
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,374
Rock.

434
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,458
- Rock, of that's one of my
favorite names.

435
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,336
I adore it.

436
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,504
Go on.

437
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,589
- Uh, we get in the car.

438
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,469
Go out to dinner - Uh huh.

439
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,888
- Take in a movie. - Uh huh.

440
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,767
- Now we're alone in the car.

441
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:32,935
Uh oh. - What?

442
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,481
- I'm not the type of girl that
kisses on the first date.

443
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,024
Ouch.

444
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:39,816
- What happened.

445
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,901
- He crushed my corsage.

446
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,181
- By George she's got it.

447
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,309
- So.

448
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,435
Am I a success?

449
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,312
- You were beautiful darling.

450
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,940
But there's one ultimate question
which must be answered.

451
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:21,900
- What's that?

452
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,818
- Will you fool anyone?

453
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,404
- How do we find out?

454
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,115
- We give you the reality test.

455
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,366
- Reality test?

456
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,374
- Good evening Mister Bartender,

457
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,043
may I have a Tom Collins please?

458
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,383
- Tom's out of town but would you
care for his replacement?

459
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,884
- Oh that's good.

460
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,052
- What's your name honey?

461
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,054
- Faith Cummings.

462
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,848
- Oh well now I'll certainly try
to keep the faith.

463
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,562
- And what's your name?

464
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,648
- Rock, it's short for Rocky.

465
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,735
Oh what's the matter?

466
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,321
- Caught a rock in my throat.

467
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,197
I mean uh,

468
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,117
went down the wrong pipe.

469
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,326
- Hey you okay.

470
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,745
- Swell. - Good.

471
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,207
What do you do Faith?

472
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,625
- Oh I'm a secretary.

473
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,586
What do you do?

474
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,754
- Everything.

475
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,130
- For a living?

476
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,925
- I sell insurance for a living.

477
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,467
What I'm trying to say is

478
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:34,302
your valuables will be in good hands
with your rock baby.

479
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:35,766
Got anything you want to insure?

480
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,643
- How about my sanity?

481
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,357
- Hey you're alright Faith.

482
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,611
Hey Charlie, how about another drink
for the little lady?

483
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:51,907
You know something that is one
terrific necklace

484
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,660
I really-- - Oh no
touching now Rock.

485
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,955
We don't wanna tarnish it now do we?

486
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,416
- No we don't wanna do that do we.

487
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,710
Welp, drink up babe.

488
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,295
Here's to ya.

489
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,047
Here's looking at ya.

490
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,594
- Well, do you come here often?

491
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,638
- Only when I need the booty.

492
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,849
Only when I need the booty.

493
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,392
- What is this your night
off or something?

494
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,770
- Oh yeah you know, the wife's out
of town and everything.

495
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,647
- You're married?

496
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,107
- Of course I'm married.

497
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,483
Everybody's married.

498
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:30,153
I've got two kids, you wanna
see their picture?

499
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,571
There see, see that?

500
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,572
Not bad huh?

501
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,490
Well you ready to go?

502
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,493
- Go, go where?

503
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,454
- Well uh, there's a
terrific little motel

504
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,581
just about three blocks
down the street.

505
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,583
Here I'll show you.

506
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:44,959
I got post cards, you see that?

507
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,586
Milton Arms, not bad huh?

508
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,423
Or a nice little cubbie hole
at a hotel downtown

509
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,719
that I use for very
special occasions.

510
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,680
Or we could uh, probablyjust
go on out in the car

511
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,557
and save a couple of bucks.

512
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,767
- Not very subtle are you?

513
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,144
- Subtle?

514
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,563
Subtle for what?

515
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,064
- Well I mean,

516
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,817
a girl doesn't like to be rushed.

517
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,862
- Hey I already bought
you two drinks.

518
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,072
Now you owe me something.

519
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,535
Now come on, I wanna get back in
time for the ball game.

520
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,078
- Let go of my arm.

521
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,665
<i>- HEY-</i>

522
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,583
What do you think you're here for.

523
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,502
I said I wanna be back in time
for the ball game

524
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,754
I don't wanna play games.

525
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,425
Of course all I want is a quickie.

526
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,469
- All you want is a quickie huh?

527
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,390
Well.

528
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,602
No way to treat a lady.

529
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,524
- You okay Rocky boy?

530
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,902
Jesus you gotta watch out for these
damned women libbers.

531
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,446
- Hey nice comeback.

532
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,782
Your face looks like a blood test.

533
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,784
Take my wife please.

534
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,619
My wife went to the beauty parlor,
she got a mud pack,

535
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,329
for two days she looked nice.

536
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,705
Then the mud fell off.

537
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,547
- Don't push so hard.

538
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,465
- I'll never get it in
if I don't push hard.

539
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,509
You should have oiled it.

540
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,594
- Just shut up
and stick it in.

541
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,763
- Put some Vaseline on it first.

542
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,890
Go on. - Oh alright.

543
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,559
Like this. -All around.

544
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,395
- Is that better? - Much better.

545
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,147
Look it's almost in now.

546
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,441
- Oh it still
doesn't fit right.

547
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,401
Try to push it to the left honey.

548
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,528
Wait it's
getting scratched.

549
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:36,613
- Scratched it's getting scratched?

550
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,365
- How could it get scratched?

551
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,658
- Yeah how could it get scratched?

552
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,034
It's got a ton of Vaseline on it.

553
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,328
- Maybe I have it
in the wrong hole'?

554
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,330
- Well that's good, he's got it
in the wrong hole.

555
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,707
- Wanna put it in a
different place or something?

556
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,001
- I've never put it in
the wrong hole before.

557
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,919
- Well then just push it

558
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,673
and maybe it will go in
all the way okay?

559
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,759
On three this time, one, two, three.

560
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,555
Wow it's in, it's in.

561
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,391
- It's in, it's in?

562
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,354
- What's the matter now Sherwood?

563
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,400
- I was just wondering will I ever
be able to get it out?

564
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,735
- You gotta get it out.

565
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,652
It's no fun if you don't get it out.

566
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,029
- See it's stuck.

567
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,115
- Oh boy, well just leave it
where it is honey,

568
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,076
okay, let's just go out to dinner.

569
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,537
- They can't go out to
dinner like that.

570
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,914
- But my cuff links are in
there and my wallet.

571
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,374
- Oh no.

572
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,251
Okay here we go again.

573
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,505
- Wait, wait, it's cracking.

574
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:39,551
Look.

575
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,594
- What?

576
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:42,679
- Something.

577
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,183
Something.

578
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,601
- What's the matter?

579
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,853
What is it?

580
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,982
- That looks like a...

581
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,889
- How's about the linguine?

582
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,641
- She's great linguine Vito.

583
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,227
- She done yet? - Almost done.

584
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,480
(knocking at door.

585
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:34,773
- Yeah?

586
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,692
- One two buckle my shoe.

587
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,154
- What's this one two
buckle my shoe bit.

588
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,490
- What do you mean,
it's the password.

589
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,450
- That's right.

590
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,911
- Well, I just passed with honors.

591
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,665
I am now a full fledged
female impersonator.

592
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,458
- Well that's better than
what you used to be

593
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,461
a full fledged police impersonator.

594
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,423
- So I got our orders.

595
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,426
I'm Faith Cummings and
you're Tobey Bricknell.

596
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,221
- Tobey Bricknell, whoever heard
of a Tobey Bricknell?

597
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,599
- I thought you'd like it.

598
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:10,683
- I hate it.

599
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:11,893
You liked it.

600
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,687
You always get the good stuff.

601
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,774
- Did you get anything on
Sherwood Gates?

602
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,692
- Well, now I know he's got a gun.

603
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:20,610
- Agun.

604
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,153
What about Vito and Paco?

605
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,696
- Those guys aren't crooks.

606
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:24,948
They're cooks.

607
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,450
All they ever talk about is food.

608
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,743
Listen.

609
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,537
- Hey is the
meatballs quickie yet?

610
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:32,873
- Not yet Vito, almost.

611
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,666
- Well beat him for
another 15 minutes.

612
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,127
- Quickie meatballs?

613
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,629
- Yeah that's what I said, all they
ever talk about is food.

614
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,714
- Doesn't make sense.

615
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:46,011
- Well maybe not, but we can get
some great recipes.

616
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,931
- Are you pounding
the meatballs Paco?

617
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,766
- Yeah Vito, I'm
pounding them.

618
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,643
I'm pounding them good.

619
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,269
- Well keep pounding them.

620
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,523
Until they get nice and tender.

621
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,694
- They're getting tender, they're
getting nice and tender.

622
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,655
- You two gonna quit working
and come to dinner?

623
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,907
- In a minute huh, in a minute.

624
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,242
- You come now and eat your fill

625
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,287
'cause next week you're gonna be
cooking for yourself.

626
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,122
- What do you mean by that?

627
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,332
- I mean I'm going to enter

628
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,418
the Artisan Models beauty
Contest this year,

629
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,588
whether you like it or not.

630
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:22,964
- No you ain't.

631
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,181
- Yes I am.

632
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,434
- You're already been turned down
three years in a row.

633
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:35,685
Now what do you wanna

634
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,603
keep taking that kind of
punishment for?

635
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:39,856
- Because I wanna, that's why.

636
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,442
- No you don't wanna.

637
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,110
No fiance of mine is gonna
be no contender

638
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,070
in no beauty contest.

639
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,989
I don't want no judges or no...

640
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,409
Nobody else looking at you
in no bathing suit.

641
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,203
- So I take off the bathing suit.

642
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,415
- Take off the bathing suit?

643
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,459
I'll kill ya, I'll make ya mort and
put ya in the ground.

644
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,085
You're gonna be my wife not
some piece of meat

645
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,921
for no judges to drool on.

646
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,048
Nice girls they don't do
things like that.

647
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,842
Nice girls they stay covered from
over here to over here.

648
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,051
And nice girls you know,

649
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:12,472
they stay a virgin until
they get married.

650
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,390
You know what, my wife's gonna
do better than that,

651
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,599
'cause my wife's gonna stay a virgin

652
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,852
even after we're married.

653
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,146
She ain't going in no contest.

654
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,315
And that's final period,
you can forget it.

655
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,317
- Really, just remember Paco,

656
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,860
we ain't married yet.

657
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:26,903
- You remember--

658
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:28,029
<i>- HEY-</i>

659
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,113
H9)'-

660
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,825
Let's everybody calm down huh.

661
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,619
Look,

662
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,498
it ain't just the idea you'd be
wearing a bathing suit Rita,

663
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,793
there might be some kind of
danger in this thing too.

664
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,878
- Danger, what's this danger?

665
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,881
You insinuating I can't protect my
fiance from danger?

666
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,049
Huh Vito is that what
you're telling me,

667
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,842
I can't protect her?

668
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,553
I'll protect her from anything.

669
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,598
If a mountain starts to fall, you
know what I'm gonna do?

670
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,140
I'm gonna get underneath it,
pick it up,

671
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,935
and put it back up again, that's
what I'm gonna do.

672
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,479
Nobody threatens my fiance, nobody.

673
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,564
She's gonna go in the contest.

674
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,233
- Oh thank you Paco.

675
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,361
Oh this man, he's a man?

676
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,074
This man I worship the feet he
walks on this man.

677
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,951
Right? - Right, right.

678
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:21,583
- And you're gonna be so proud of
me Paco when I win.

679
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:22,959
- Alright fine, but you're
still ain't wearing

680
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,294
no bathing suit.

681
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,962
You're gonna be covered from
here to over there.

682
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,380
- No I ain't. - Yes you are.

683
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,297
- I ain't. - You're gonna.

684
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,549
- I ain't. - Yes you are.

685
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,177
- Please God, let them
get married soon

686
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,096
and move out.

687
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,099
- So Gates found the mic and Vito
spends all his time

688
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,268
talking about meatballs.

689
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,103
Well that's great.

690
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,563
Just great.

691
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:44,898
- There is one other thing Chief.

692
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,191
- What's that?

693
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,651
- Well Vito told Rita that
he didn't want her

694
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,361
to enter the contest
because of the danger.

695
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,279
- But we already knew that Casey.

696
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,282
- So we're right back
where we started.

697
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,200
- At least we haven't lost
any ground Chief.

698
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:56,993
- Whoopie.

699
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,457
- Chief Willinghand's office,
Fulton here.

700
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:04,334
Really?

701
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:06,669
Okay 10-4.

702
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,381
Sherwood Gates is on his way up here
and he's plenty mad.

703
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,884
- Jesus, you guys get out
of here quick.

704
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,437
- Chief Willinghand,

705
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,315
I am Sherwood P Gates Ill,

706
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,150
the P is for the pandemonium
I'm going to put

707
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,736
your police department in in
about five minutes.

708
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,322
You know why I'm here.

709
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,532
- Uh no I don't Mister Gates.

710
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,826
Unless it concerns our
investigation into the

711
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,828
artists and models murders.

712
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,997
- How very droll of you
Chief Willinghand

713
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,957
to assume the role of
public defender.

714
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,960
What argument will you
sling my way next?

715
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,253
National Defense?

716
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,006
- No one's going to sling anything
your way Mister Gates.

717
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,507
- Nothing except a hidden
microphone in my apartment.

718
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,010
- The chief of police can not
be held responsible

719
00:34:56,344 --> 00:35:00,306
for the over zealousness of his
subordinates Mister Gates.

720
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,017
- We'll just let that statement
hang there for awhile

721
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,435
Miss uh...

722
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,686
- Fulton.

723
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,690
- Fulton, until it sinks of
it's own weight.

724
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,984
- What's the purpose of this
visit Mister Gates?

725
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,612
- The point is that I do not
like being bugged.

726
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,530
And on this very point
the law is with me

727
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,032
despite the rather incredible fact

728
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,577
that you were the laws
local representative.

729
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,871
Awire tapping episode could
be pretty costly

730
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,707
to your career Chief Willinghand.

731
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:30,378
I've seen lives go up in
smoke for far less.

732
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,088
Far less.

733
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,507
- You seem to forget Mister Gates

734
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,676
that three girls have been murdered.

735
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,511
Now we don't intend to sit back

736
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,805
and let it happen a fourth time.

737
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,599
- It won't happen a fourth
time Miss uh...

738
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,225
- Fulton.

739
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,477
- Miss Fulton.

740
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,479
- And how can you be sure of that.

741
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,481
- Because the murderer has
been apprehended.

742
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,690
- What?

743
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,609
- Turned himself into
me this morning.

744
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,069
His name is Carl Fancher.

745
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,612
Came to my office and
claimed that he killed

746
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,072
all three girls.

747
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,824
- This is incredible.

748
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,159
Well where is he now?

749
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,286
- Out front, in custody
of my bodyguard.

750
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,497
They're double parked in
front of your station.

751
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,207
- This is simply outrageous.

752
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,209
Why didn't you report this
to us immediately?

753
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,378
- You're the one that's
outrageous Willinghand.

754
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,338
Imagine bugging me-

755
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,882
Now I'm warning you,

756
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,259
unless you wanna be brought up
on criminal charges

757
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,094
of illegal wire tap,

758
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,054
keep your clumsy stupid cops away

759
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,557
from the Artisan Models Ball.

760
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,017
It's a charity affair.

761
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,853
Charity Chief Willinghand.

762
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,690
The participants will not take
kindly to police harassment.

763
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,986
Now you've got your killer and
the case is closed.

764
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,907
And if you cross me,

765
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,744
you might just find your
little bugging episode

766
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,413
in three inch type on the front page
of the city's newspaper

767
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,789
you understand?

768
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,458
- Yes Mister Gates.

769
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,795
- See that you do.

770
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,047
Come along and get your suspect.

771
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,385
- I killed them.

772
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,014
I killed all three of them.

773
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,395
It's pretty good for a
guy like me huh?

774
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:17,693
I hope they didn't suffer any pain.

775
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:21,196
But we're all born to
suffer pain right?

776
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:24,700
Right?

777
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:27,328
- Right Fancher.

778
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,416
- Yeah.

779
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,586
All of us born to suffer pain.

780
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,343
- How long have you had that cough?

781
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,219
- Oh,

782
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,139
it's nothing I just,

783
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:47,724
I smoke too much.

784
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,059
Where was I?

785
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,188
Oh yes the girls I killed.

786
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,689
Well,

787
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,109
the first one I killed
was really good.

788
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,320
But the second one, the second
one was even better.

789
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,822
But not as good as the third.

790
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,575
No the third one,

791
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,454
the third one was really,
really the best one.

792
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,456
- Satisfied Chief?

793
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,212
- For the time being.

794
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,631
- Remember those headlines.

795
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,049
Goodnight.

796
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,259
And goodnight to you Misses uh...

797
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,136
- Fulton.

798
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,554
- Fulton, goodnight.

799
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:33,936
- Fulton,

800
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,315
better call Dave and Casey,

801
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,025
we'll postpone the operation.

802
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,444
- Do you think that's wise?

803
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,657
- Well there's no need to
proceed with it now.

804
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:49,202
- Yes sir.

805
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,205
- I got a surprise for you honey.

806
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,916
- What? - I didn't get
the promotion.

807
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,417
You know what that means?

808
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,752
It means I'll be right
here with you,

809
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,796
we can do everything we planned
because I'm not going away.

810
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,172
Isn't that fantastic?

811
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,383
- Why're you looking at
me like that?

812
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,218
- Like what?

813
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,305
- You got that suspicious look
around your eyes again.

814
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,432
- Dave I'm not suspicious.

815
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,101
I understand about your work.

816
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,603
I know you're involved in life
and death assignments

817
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,275
that come up one week and don't come
off the next, really.

818
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,319
I appreciate the tension.

819
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,446
The grating hours.

820
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,281
The uncertainty that
accompanies a job

821
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,284
with changes like yours.

822
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,953
But there's only one
thing I wanna know?

823
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,289
- What?

824
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,957
- How'd you screw up the promotion.

825
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,006
- So after I strangled her,

826
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,341
I dragged her off of the bed,

827
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,677
and I propped up in a chair,

828
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,764
and I lit a cigarette,

829
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,476
and I put it in her mouth.

830
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,437
I think it made her happy.

831
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,565
- Did it make you happy Fancher?

832
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,026
- I guess so.

833
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,323
- Let's go Fancher.

834
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,453
- I think it did make me happy.

835
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,377
- What do you think?

836
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,130
- It seems awfully easy doesn't it?

837
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,131
- Too easy.

838
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,050
Just doesn't smell right.

839
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,762
- Yeah he knew all the answers,
I mean things,

840
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,808
information not generally
known to the public.

841
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,979
- Yeah but he could have rehearsed
and sent in here with a

842
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:44,525
well prepared story that
fits all the details.

843
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,236
- Yeah but why, why would he do it?

844
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,446
- Look at him, listen to that cough.

845
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,408
10-1 he's a dead man in six months.

846
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,871
- It's true, but that even
makes less sense.

847
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,166
Why would he pretend to
be the killer?

848
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,418
- If he has a family somewhere

849
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,503
who's about to come into a lot of
money if he goes to prison

850
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,089
in place of the real murderer.

851
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,632
And the odds are he'll
plead insanity

852
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,135
and wind up in an
institution any way.

853
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,680
- Or at least he'll die comfortably,

854
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,975
I mean more comfortably
than he lived.

855
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,061
- You know I think we outta go ahead

856
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,438
with the operation as planned.

857
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,775
If the real murderer is
still on the loose,

858
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,362
we'll take advantage and
catch them off guard.

859
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:33,157
- I'll call Casey and
Collins in the morning.

860
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:47,922
- Hello?

861
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:51,050
Yes.

862
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,136
What time is it?

863
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:55,930
Three AM?

864
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,434
Just a minute.

865
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:02,561
Dave.

866
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,066
Dave wake up, there's someone named
Fulton on the phone.

867
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,029
- Hello?

868
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,323
Yes.

869
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:16,909
It's what?

870
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:19,245
For when?

871
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,289
Tomorrow afternoon?

872
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:24,917
It's on again.

873
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,628
Yes.

874
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,879
0K3)'-

875
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:29,796
0K3)'-

876
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:31,966
Goodnight, I mean goodbye.

877
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,682
The case is on, we leave tomorrow.

878
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,435
- Who's this Fulton person?

879
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,187
- My superior honey.

880
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,562
- Oh really.

881
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:49,025
Officer Fulton, Officer Fulton,
she's a cop.

882
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,735
- Does she work undercover to?

883
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,573
- Not under my covers,
that's your job baby.

884
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,033
- It better be.

885
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,037
- Hello.

886
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,581
Oh.

887
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,375
Yes I was asleep.

888
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,128
What can I do for you Lieutenant?

889
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,048
Okay Lieutenant.

890
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:12,923
10-4.

891
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,679
That was Lieutenant Fulton.

892
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,306
She wants us on the cruise
ship Emerald Seas,

893
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:24,060
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30.

894
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:28,522
And we're to dress in civis but
bring Keystone Kops outfits.

895
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,275
- Keystone Kops outfits?

896
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,402
- Yes, there will be 10 of us there

897
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,195
dressed as Keystone Kopss.

898
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,282
We have to protect the
beauty contest winner.

899
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,659
- Oh I'd rather go as the
ballet dancer.

900
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,787
- Oh shut up and go back to sleep.

901
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,500
- Don't you even want me
to help you pack.

902
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,545
I always helped you pack before.

903
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,588
- Honey this assignment is
really undercover

904
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,340
and very confidential.

905
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,841
- I won't tell anyone.

906
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,135
- Honey please go to work.

907
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,763
- Alright.

908
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:01,639
Good luck.

909
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,227
- See you in about a week.

910
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,439
- Come back in one piece.

911
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,108
- Honey you're going to be late.

912
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,742
- Cookie baby how are ya?

913
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:23,577
Going to work?

914
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:24,578
- Where are you going?

915
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,455
- Top secret kid, top secret.

916
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,000
Stay cool.

917
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,510
- Hi come on in.

918
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,348
- What a thing to greet
your buddy with.

919
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,850
Oh had a little rough and
tumble last night huh?

920
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,145
- I'm almost ready.

921
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,615
- You know,

922
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,158
I've been thinking.

923
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,621
This isn't going to be such a bad
assignment after all.

924
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:08,789
- How so?

925
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,500
- Well the way I figure it is,

926
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:14,253
Fancher is the killer,

927
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,673
which means you and me are
going on an assignment

928
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,592
which doesn't have any
reason for existing.

929
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,845
- Except as a safeguard huh?

930
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,513
- Yeah.

931
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,889
But just think,

932
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,685
all those beauty contestants,

933
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,353
free room and board,

934
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,397
a trip to Nassau,

935
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,066
and no killer to worry about.

936
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,859
So there we are having a ball.

937
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:40,446
You, me, Faith and Tobey.

938
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,740
Tobey and Faith correct,

939
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,743
and while Tobey's out picking up
the beauty contestants

940
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,870
you'll be in there with Faith.

941
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:49,622
- Very funny.

942
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,624
- You have to admit

943
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,376
Faith is your type.

944
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,711
- Even though she's a drag, yuk yuk.

945
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,129
- It could be some vacation.

946
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,674
The four of us out on
the Emerald Seas.

947
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,072
- Well, how do I look?

948
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,921
- Like an old hooker in
a new bottle.

949
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,340
- I thought I looked pretty good.

950
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,300
- You never did have any taste.

951
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,844
- That's for sure, look who I
chose as my escort.

952
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,890
Let's go, the ships going to
sail without us.

953
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:53,519
Thank you.

954
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,924
- Why has the prize money been upped

955
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,009
to $15,000 Mister Gates?

956
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,720
- The amount is irrelevant madam.

957
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,348
After all who could put a price tag
on the beautiful woman.

958
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,017
- Does it have anything to do
with the murders?

959
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,895
- Absolutely not.

960
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,437
- Isn't it true that you've
had a hard time

961
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:41,275
scraping up contestants this year
due to adverse publicity.

962
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:44,903
- Why don't you news persons ever
think positively eh?

963
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,571
I don't know whether
you've heard or not,

964
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,617
but the killer was apprehended and
is now in police custody.

965
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,285
- Why is it you allowed known
underworld figures

966
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,413
like Vito Vito to come on board

967
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,707
the Emerald Seas Mister Gates?

968
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,625
- Anyone who gives is allowed madam,

969
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,752
and Mister Vito has always
given generously.

970
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:02,880
- You don't mind being associated
with that kind of--

971
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,674
- I believe I have already answered
your question madam.

972
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,176
- Well look who we have here
ladies and gentlemen,

973
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,347
underworld czar Vito Vito,
with his family.

974
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,973
Miss Vito, are you going to be a
contestant this year?

975
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,309
- Yeah, I'm a contestant.

976
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:16,226
- What do you wanna know for?

977
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,352
You gonna make something of it?

978
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,269
- No of course not.

979
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,021
- Then keep your nose out of it.

980
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,731
- Calm down will ya?

981
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,610
A little hot headed, especially when
he's around my sister.

982
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,111
- They ain't gonna see her
in no bathing suit.

983
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,988
- Shut up, they will to.

984
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,197
- Cover yourself up,
what's the matter,

985
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,075
you're going crazy of something?

986
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,618
You looking at her huh?

987
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,453
You looking at her, nobody
better look at her.

988
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:35,329
- I do what I want.

989
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,878
- Hey uh, let's use a
little discretion

990
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,632
to these stories huh fellas.

991
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,300
I'm depending on ya.

992
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,184
- You're Lucy McRae aren't you?

993
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,644
- Yes that's right.

994
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,105
- You used to be in show
business didn't you?

995
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,273
- Right again.

996
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,983
- And you're black aren't you?

997
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,321
- You're Mister
Sherwood Gates fiance?

998
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,656
- That's right?

999
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:11,991
- Well how does it feel
to be engaged

1000
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,034
to one of the wealthiest
men in America?

1001
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,536
- Listen, I don't love
him for his money

1002
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,788
if that's what you're implying.

1003
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,957
- Oh what do you love him for?

1004
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,042
- I haven't yet decided.

1005
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,049
- Miss-- - No.

1006
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,510
I'm her mother I do the talking.

1007
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:32,761
- What's your daughter's name?

1008
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,055
- Oh my name is Margo and
this Jennette.

1009
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,933
Yeah she is beautiful isn't she?

1010
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:38,809
38-24-36.

1011
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,689
And there isn't a blemish on
her entire body.

1012
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,401
And there also isn't a girl on this
ship who can touch her.

1013
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,863
Oh I'm sure they're all
very nice girls.

1014
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,741
Some of them even with
mothers and fathers.

1015
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,075
Oh God bless them.

1016
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,160
But my daughter here well,

1017
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,623
she's just as wholesome as
a glass of milk.

1018
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,082
Well go on, touch.

1019
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:04,668
Go ahead.

1020
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,047
Isn't that nice.

1021
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,131
- Very nice.

1022
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,806
- I'm talking now with Flo
and Ruth Bobish.

1023
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,057
Hi Flo, Hi Ruth.

1024
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,768
- Wave Ruthie.

1025
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,311
- Oh hello.

1026
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,482
- You ladies come to the Artisan
Models Ball every year

1027
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,108
to collect for the
orphans of the world.

1028
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,986
Isn't that right?

1029
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,821
- Yes that's right Jenny.

1030
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,740
- Yes for the orphans and
here's a picture of one.

1031
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,035
- Oh gee, poor little fellow.

1032
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:41,497
He looks really hungry,
doesn't he Flo and Ruth?

1033
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,207
- That's why we're collecting.

1034
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,975
- Order me a

1035
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,103
whiskey sour I'll be
back in a minute.

1036
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,146
- Where are you going?

1037
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,106
- Gotta powder my nose.

1038
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,735
- Inn keeper.

1039
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,268
- Jesus.

1040
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,313
- What's the matter with you?

1041
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,064
- I went into the men's
room by mistake.

1042
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:50,399
- Jesus, anyone see you there?

1043
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,527
- Just Sherwood gates. - What?

1044
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,404
- It was an accident.

1045
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,322
- And what'd you do?

1046
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,199
- Well I excused myself

1047
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,409
and then I went into
the ladies room.

1048
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:02,286
- Uh yeah?

1049
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,830
One thing about you boy,

1050
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,709
you got class.

1051
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:09,793
- Excuse me.

1052
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,757
I think you dropped this in
the men's room.

1053
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:16,633
- Yes.

1054
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,427
Thank you I'm

1055
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,096
so embarrassed.

1056
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:22,556
- You needn't be.

1057
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,182
The same things happen to me.

1058
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,476
- You mean you went into the
men's room by mistake?

1059
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,102
- Who's this?

1060
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,355
- Oh that's my escort
Tobey Bricknell.

1061
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,190
I'm Faith Cummings.

1062
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,067
- You're one of the contestants?

1063
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,193
- Yes.

1064
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,863
- Lovely name.

1065
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,239
Faith Cummings.

1066
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,282
- And you're

1067
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,827
Mister Gates?

1068
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,913
- At your service.

1069
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,665
- You have a strong grip.

1070
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,208
I like that in a woman.

1071
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,751
- You outta see her backhand.

1072
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,088
- Won't you join us Mister Gates?

1073
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,880
- I'd be delighted.

1074
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,846
- Well this is my first ball,
I'm so excited.

1075
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,890
- They're very exciting occasions.

1076
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,142
- You know I remember my first ball.

1077
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:09,186
A little low on the outside.

1078
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,270
- Balls,

1079
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,106
must be old hat to someone like you.

1080
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,276
- No, I never tire of
the excitement.

1081
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,823
The color, jocularity, the high
spirits of the occasion,

1082
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,118
always given me a positive
attitude toward life.

1083
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,996
It's hard not to have a negative
attitude these days

1084
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,205
don't you think?

1085
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,208
What with all the wars

1086
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,293
and mendacious politicians,

1087
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,295
boorishness, stupidity,

1088
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,796
it tears the heart,

1089
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,842
takes away ones faith in humanity.

1090
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,177
But meeting you has

1091
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,637
restored my faith.

1092
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,098
- I'm touched.

1093
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:48,767
- I'm nauseous.

1094
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,352
- Perhaps you'd have a drink
with me my dear,

1095
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:51,561
later in my cabin.

1096
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,438
- Why Mister Gates I--

1097
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,899
- Ah don't worry, everything
will be quite proper.

1098
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,275
- Hey Gates.

1099
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,319
Vito wants to talk to
you in private.

1100
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,362
- Right now?

1101
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,614
- Yeah right now, come on.

1102
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:04,783
- Excuse me Miss Cummings.

1103
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,994
- Yes. - I'll see you
later I'm sure.

1104
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,329
- Ta ta.

1105
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,414
- That guy's unbelievable. - Who?

1106
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,708
- Gates.

1107
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,333
Didn't you see the way he
came on with the,

1108
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,294
I mean here you are, you're sitting
down with your escort,

1109
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,255
and this guy comes on
like oozing butter.

1110
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,009
- Well I can't help it if he
finds me attractive.

1111
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,094
- You didn't have to lead him on.

1112
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,305
- I think you're jealous.

1113
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,556
- How'd you like to find your head

1114
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:31,351
stuffed halfway through a porthole.

1115
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,644
- Listen, why don't you go see

1116
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,729
if you can get a bead on what's
happening with those guys?

1117
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,064
- What are you gonna do?

1118
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,273
- I'll check
things out up here.

1119
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,317
- Okay-

1120
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,317
Don't flirt with everybody okay,

1121
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,110
I mean it doesn't look good.

1122
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:41,987
- Ge lost.

1123
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,406
Bartender another drink please.

1124
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,334
- I'll have what she's having.

1125
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,753
I didn't know you were
cruising too Dave.

1126
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,379
- The name is Faith.

1127
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,218
- Yes, how careless of me.

1128
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,762
But I want you to know I'm delighted

1129
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,222
to see you here.

1130
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,184
I was beginning to think
this whole trip

1131
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,645
would be one long lonely bore.

1132
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,440
- Well I must be off.

1133
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,779
Jesus! - That was a quick trip.

1134
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,697
- Yes it was, yes it was.

1135
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,491
- Gin and tonic please.

1136
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,265
- So, it's
come to this again.

1137
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,058
- I'm sorry Mister Gates.

1138
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,353
- You shouldn't be,
it's not your fault.

1139
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,105
<i>, HEY»</i>

1140
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,232
what's this about whose
fault it is huh?

1141
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:02,776
Whose fault is that?

1142
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,319
Whose fault is this?

1143
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,946
We all profit from it right huh?

1144
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,740
- There is a moral question.

1145
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,325
- It's not humane.

1146
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,077
- Who you talking to humane.

1147
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:13,328
What's this humane crap,

1148
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,205
you're getting paid for it ain't ya?

1149
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,290
- I'm sorry to say that,

1150
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,125
yes I am.

1151
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,712
- He's sorry to say
he's getting paid.

1152
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,255
Really sorry.

1153
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,633
- He just likes to hear
himself talk.

1154
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:27,634
That's all.

1155
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,511
So Mister Gates,

1156
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,516
everything shipshape this year?

1157
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,893
- Everything's the same as
it was last year

1158
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,062
and the year before that.

1159
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,355
- Remember you are treading
on the sickness

1160
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,817
of a human being that should be
in an institution.

1161
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:45,402
<i>, HEY»</i>

1162
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,821
is that your solution to Gates,

1163
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:49,239
an institution?

1164
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,283
- No, you know it isn't.

1165
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,328
- Mister Gates,

1166
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,499
he feels kind of guilty about
this whole thing.

1167
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,542
Right Gates?

1168
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,377
- Right Vito.

1169
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,255
- Well,

1170
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,008
he should.

1171
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,510
Oh

1172
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,179
he should feel very, very guilty.

1173
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:16,599
Right Gates?

1174
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,228
- Right.

1175
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,525
- But now, he's getting something.

1176
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,737
And we're getting something.

1177
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:29,946
Fair is fair.

1178
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:34,242
Everybody gets a little something.

1179
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,411
Right Gates?

1180
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,248
- Right.

1181
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,542
- Hey you're damned right.

1182
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,713
- Looking for somebody?

1183
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,299
- Looking for somebody?

1184
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,384
Looking for somebody?

1185
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,761
Yeah I was looking for somebody.

1186
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,388
- Who? - Who?

1187
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,306
- Yeah who're you looking for.

1188
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,767
- Well I've been looking for you?

1189
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:00,352
- For me, why me?

1190
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:04,439
- I really don't know where
the cafeteria is.

1191
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,024
Good day. - Ciao.

1192
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:07,067
- Hey who's that?

1193
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,068
- I don't know.

1194
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,403
But I think he's in love with me.

1195
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,570
- In love with you!

1196
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,537
- Excuse me sir,

1197
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,415
do you know where I can find
Juan Hutee Almerta?

1198
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,333
- Yes, he is the
gentlemen with a beret

1199
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:25,752
at the end of the bar.

1200
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:26,836
- Thank you.

1201
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:05,417
- Are you Juan Hutee Almerta?

1202
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,339
- What?

1203
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,758
- Si, I mean yes I am.

1204
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,676
- So you're the guy who
paints the girls bodies

1205
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,638
for the Artisan Models Ball?

1206
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:19,597
- Yes I am.

1207
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,768
- How much would you
charge to paint mine?

1208
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,704
- Oh you look like a winner.

1209
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,334
So I will not charge you anything.

1210
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,502
But if you do win,

1211
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,587
I Will Want 25%

1212
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,507
- Okay, can you come to my
stateroom tomorrow morning

1213
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,301
so that we can look
over the designs.

1214
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:01,598
- Oh definitely, I will be there at
Ten with my paints.

1215
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,860
- Oh look.

1216
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,571
Everybody's dancing.

1217
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:21,785
Excuse me.

1218
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,204
I seem to be catching a cold.

1219
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:25,705
- Take my shawl.

1220
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,834
- Oh thank you, that's
very sweet of you.

1221
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,003
- Good evening Faith.

1222
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,339
- Oh back again so soon.

1223
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:35,632
- Care to dance?

1224
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,716
- Delighted.

1225
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,896
- Don't they make a lovely couple?

1226
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:54,609
- Yeah.

1227
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,239
Gee ya know,

1228
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,702
she looks awfully familiar to me.

1229
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,705
- Everyone looks like someone
else darling, everyone.

1230
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,375
There is not one original
face on the globe.

1231
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,970
- I know you from someplace don't I?

1232
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,389
- Yes as matter of fact you do.

1233
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:25,265
- Where?

1234
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:28,768
- Try to remember Lucy,

1235
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,647
it will certainly help all
of us if you could.

1236
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,735
- Well, well, well,

1237
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,614
how are you today Miss McRae huh?

1238
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,074
- I'm alright how are you?

1239
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,118
- Just great, we're great.

1240
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,495
We're just great, right Doc?

1241
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,956
Ain't we great huh? - Hey Paco.

1242
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,125
- We're just great ain't we Doc.

1243
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,668
- Why don't you take the doc outside

1244
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,837
and have a little talk with him huh?

1245
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:58,715
- Come on Doc, we're gonna go
for a little walk.

1246
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,967
Hey, c'mon let's go.

1247
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:01,843
Let's go.

1248
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:08,141
- Lucy, LUCY-

1249
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:10,018
- What do you want Vito?

1250
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,269
What do you want?

1251
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,272
- Just to be near you Lucy.

1252
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:18,526
You know, you don't got no idea how
important you are to me.

1253
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,486
- Oh really, how extraordinary.

1254
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,989
You mean absolutely nothing to me
Vito, just nothing.

1255
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,868
- Flattery don't get you no place.

1256
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,790
- Look Dave I think we're
on to something.

1257
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,375
- Dave?

1258
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:35,459
Casey? - Cookie

1259
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,295
What are you doing?

1260
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:38,463
Where's Dave?

1261
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:39,714
I mean where's Faith?

1262
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,508
- Your friend ran off to dance.

1263
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,677
- Excuse me. - Wait, Casey.

1264
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,221
- Oh bless you.

1265
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,694
- Well hello there.

1266
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,864
Don't we have a
conversation to finish?

1267
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,917
- Mind if I cut in?

1268
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:16,793
Thank you.

1269
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:19,671
<i>- HEY-</i>

1270
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,229
- I couldn't get it all but this
doctor's in it somehow

1271
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:37,855
and Gates is in it up to his ears,

1272
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,773
but don't ask me how or why.

1273
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:43,694
- One thing, how'd the hell
did Cookie find us?

1274
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:44,863
- I don't know.

1275
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:49,409
The whole thing's a mess.

1276
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:50,785
I should have joined the
sanitation department

1277
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,329
like my brother Melvin.

1278
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,081
He really cleaned up.

1279
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,459
- Good night.

1280
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,668
- Good night.

1281
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,713
- Where the hell have you been?

1282
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:45,840
- What do you mean where the
hell have I been.

1283
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:47,133
- Yeah where the hell have you been.

1284
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,843
The ships been through
customs an hour already.

1285
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:49,760
- I'll tell you where I've been,

1286
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:50,804
I have to refill 40 cases,

1287
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,849
that's 480 cans of that
pina colada mix.

1288
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:55,892
- Yeah well what the hell did you do

1289
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,895
to the pina colada mix after
you threw it out?

1290
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,230
- After I threw it out, I put
it in plastic bags,

1291
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,022
and I put it in the backseat
of that red Buick

1292
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:03,483
that was down there at the
end of the pier.

1293
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:04,776
- The Buick. - The red one.

1294
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,444
- The red Buick down at the
end of the dock.

1295
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:07,779
- Yeah.

1296
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:09,948
- That's the chief custom
inspector's car.

1297
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,782
- I know, I know, he
found it already.

1298
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,076
- He fuck, he what?

1299
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,160
- He found it, he probably figures

1300
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,828
he's got a load of cocaine.

1301
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,414
I saw him looking all around,
and he took off.

1302
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,790
- He took off.

1303
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,876
What happens if he takes one of
those things and tastes it?

1304
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:23,502
What then stupid?

1305
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,840
- He's gonna think he has
pineapple flavored cocaine.

1306
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:27,882
- Pineapple, you're crazy,

1307
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,759
you're really botch you know that.

1308
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:30,843
Back the truck up over there

1309
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,845
so I can get the two
porters to empty it.

1310
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,471
- Wait a minute. - Hey.

1311
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,725
I want you to go back and get four
or five more of our boys.

1312
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:40,102
Alright, I want you, I want them
to come back to the

1313
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,646
masquerade with us tonight.

1314
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,022
- Why?

1315
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,524
- Because I want them there in case
we get in any trouble.

1316
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,902
Then I want you to go to
my state room.

1317
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:49,904
S44's the number.

1318
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,197
It's up stairs. - I know
where it is, I know.

1319
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:52,782
- You know, okay? - Yeah.

1320
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,952
- You're gonna find a big yellow
box, a big yellow box.

1321
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:59,205
On the side of the box it says
Dixon Costume Company.

1322
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:00,831
- Got it, got it. - You got it?

1323
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:05,420
In side the box there's six
Keystone Kops outfits.

1324
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,670
- Keystone Kop?

1325
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:07,839
Why Keystone Kops?

1326
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,632
- Listen, don't be.

1327
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,177
Because if there's any
real cops on board,

1328
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,762
they ain't never gonna figure us

1329
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,972
for being no Keystone Kops right?

1330
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,182
- You're right. - I know.

1331
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,391
- Beautiful.

1332
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,435
- Alright see ya.

1333
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,060
- Nassau again.

1334
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,771
What a drag.

1335
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,233
- I like it, I think it's
a sweet place.

1336
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:30,069
- So long as you don't
pinch anything Flo.

1337
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:31,946
- You can count on me.

1338
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,454
- Looks like Vito and his gang
are going ashore.

1339
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:22,663
- You haven't seen the
doctor have you?

1340
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,164
- No, I haven't.

1341
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,875
- Look, keep your eye out for him,

1342
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,838
'cause I have a hunch that he
might be helpful to us.

1343
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,386
How do you feel about taking a look
in Vito's stateroom?

1344
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,345
- Let's go.

1345
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,368
- You little son of a bitch.

1346
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,132
- Hello? - Hello.

1347
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,384
This is Captain Dorma,

1348
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,887
may I speak with Chief Officer
Willinghand please?

1349
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,680
- Chief Willinghand and
Officer Fulton

1350
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:05,725
are shopping downtown Nassau.

1351
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:07,977
- Shopping, listen three passengers

1352
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,603
have been stabbed on my ship.

1353
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,355
We have an eye witness
to the last one

1354
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,483
who said a clown stabbed a girl.

1355
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,443
- Yes Captain I know.

1356
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:19,197
But there are a lot of clowns
running around the ship.

1357
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,448
And I can't arrest them all.

1358
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:29,248
- All passengers your
attention please,

1359
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:30,833
this is your cruise director,

1360
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,586
and on behalf of the captain and
the crews operator,

1361
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,880
I would like to apologize for
the inconvenience

1362
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,798
that you have suffered as a result

1363
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:40,259
of this killer being
loose on the ship.

1364
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:41,885
Now this has never happened before

1365
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,763
and it's beyond our control.

1366
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,307
Now for your safety the
captain has ordered

1367
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,268
that all of you go to your
cabins and stay there

1368
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:52,104
until this maniac has been captured.

1369
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,522
Thank you.

1370
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,716
- Well, what happened to your
little pick up Sherwood?

1371
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,302
She desert you for someone a
little younger huh?

1372
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,261
A little more limber?

1373
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,722
- Lucy stop! - No you stop it!

1374
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:27,973
- Stop what?

1375
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,266
I haven't done anything.

1376
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,559
- You're always so
innocent aren't you.

1377
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,311
You're always the innocent one.

1378
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,396
- Usually yes, at least to the
things you accuse me of.

1379
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:35,648
- Liar!

1380
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,441
- Lucy keep your voice down, please.

1381
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,818
- What about those three
girls Sherwood?

1382
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,155
Did you celebrate an innocent
stretch far enough

1383
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,989
to encompass them too?

1384
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:44,865
Tell me.

1385
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:47,326
- What's the matter?

1386
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,536
- Nothing, nothing Sherwood.

1387
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:51,038
- Can I get you something?

1388
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,456
- Yes.

1389
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:56,502
You can get me something, just peace
and quiet that's all.

1390
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:58,295
Just peace and quiet.

1391
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,469
- Dave come here.

1392
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:11,141
- What is it? - It's a receipt.

1393
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:15,354
- For 40 dozen cases of
instant pina colada mix.

1394
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:16,563
- What the hell's he want 40 cases

1395
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:19,150
of instant pina colada mix?

1396
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,776
- Maybe he's got a bad pina.

1397
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,325
- Give me Vito's stateroom please.

1398
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,334
- Hey, what's the matter with him?

1399
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,298
- Hello?

1400
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,384
Hello?

1401
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,177
- What are you doing here?

1402
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:49,096
Please get out of here before,

1403
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,180
before something happen to you.

1404
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:51,390
- Here let me help you Doc,
come here.

1405
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:52,224
- I'll be alright.

1406
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:53,725
I'll be alright.

1407
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,604
I'll be alright.

1408
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:01,984
I must get medication to

1409
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,485
Doctor Gates.

1410
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,529
- Let's take him over to our cabin.

1411
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:05,529
- Let's go.

1412
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,322
- Who's this?

1413
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:49,490
- His names Doctor Ravenna.

1414
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:50,783
Paco worked him over a little bit.

1415
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,452
Why's he got pass on my bed?

1416
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,537
- Why'd he do this to you Doc?

1417
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,039
- I say nothing.

1418
01:12:58,958 --> 01:12:59,625
Nothing.

1419
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,710
- Well well.

1420
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,211
When did you two get on board?

1421
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:04,838
- Oh we just boarded in Nassau.

1422
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,716
- We had a little bit of luck Dave.

1423
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:08,717
- Luck, it was more than just luck.

1424
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,261
It was pure investigative skill.

1425
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:13,389
- Well whatever it was
Fancher broke down

1426
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:14,724
and confessed the whole story.

1427
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,059
- Yeah Gates paid him to
confess to the murders.

1428
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,062
- Yeah and since Fancher was dying,
he went along with it.

1429
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,855
- Yeah the thing is, once he
realized he wasn't dying

1430
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:23,481
he told the truth.

1431
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,442
- You see Gates fed him
all the details,

1432
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:28,779
gave him all the facts, he gave
credence to his confession.

1433
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,072
- The question is,

1434
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,615
how did Gates know all the details.

1435
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,575
- I know, I know.

1436
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,369
'Cause Gates is the killer, right.

1437
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,371
- So then when do we arrest him?

1438
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,373
- Well it's fairly simple Dave.

1439
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:43,085
Apparently Gates is being
blackmailed by Vito,

1440
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:44,420
who knows about the murders,

1441
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,965
into smuggling aboard this ship vast
quantities of cocaine.

1442
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:52,344
Now this cocaine is wrapped in wax
paper and smuggled in,

1443
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:55,389
in cans of instant pina colada mix.

1444
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:59,393
Pina coloda is, as you know,
a delicious drink,

1445
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,895
comprised of pineapple and
coconut juices,

1446
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:06,524
which when blended produce a tangy
taste to the palette,

1447
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:10,445
none too tart, none too sweet,
but just...

1448
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,657
Well as a matter of fact, one zany
night in Puerto Rico

1449
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,409
the chief and I we...

1450
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,120
Sorry Chief.

1451
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:23,333
- Anyway the way it looks now, Gates
is our chief suspect.

1452
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,670
And Vito knows it, he's
blackmailing him.

1453
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,087
We figured if we could
get on this ship

1454
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,422
and rode it into Miami,

1455
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,132
we'd get ourselves not only a killer

1456
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,176
but a whole ring of coke smugglers.

1457
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,470
That's why we held off on
arresting Gates.

1458
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,472
- So what do we do in the meantime?

1459
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:37,723
- We proceed just as planned.

1460
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:39,850
You enter the contest
just as we decided.

1461
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,393
- Aside from averting suspicions,

1462
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,146
it will give us a great sitting
duck for the killer.

1463
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,441
- Yeah, I forgot about
that part of it.

1464
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,027
- Hey uh, what do you think of
our costumes huh?

1465
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:51,403
Arlene and I went down and,

1466
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,114
I mean Officer Fulton and I went
down and picked them out.

1467
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,615
I doubt that there'd be
many people dressed

1468
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,451
as a Keystone Kop.

1469
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,085
- Hey, how do you like
this number huh?

1470
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,506
Just like the movies I used to
see when I was a kid.

1471
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,592
With the pianos going tinkle tinkle.

1472
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:15,678
<i>HEY»</i>

1473
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,475
whatever happened to the old moving
pictures anyway huh?

1474
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,602
- I'll tell you what happened
to moving pictures.

1475
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,687
They're waiting for me that's
what happened to 'em.

1476
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,398
- They ain't waiting for you.

1477
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,482
You ain't going to no
moving pictures.

1478
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:29,775
You're going to stay home

1479
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,026
where you can cook and make babies.

1480
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,277
- You quit telling me what to do.

1481
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:33,862
- Hey you know something?

1482
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,614
You too make me sick.

1483
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,492
I'm going to the can.

1484
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,247
Hey Paco. - What?

1485
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,666
- Paco, the doc.

1486
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,793
He ain't in the toilet no more.

1487
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:49,461
- What do you mean he ain't in
the toilet no more.

1488
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,754
I gave him a shot in the head,

1489
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,547
he couldn't walk six
inches by himself.

1490
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:53,507
- You give him a shot? - Yeah.

1491
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:54,550
- You give him a shot.

1492
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:58,345
I give you a shot you moron,
he got away.

1493
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,113
- Chief, you think
Fulton will be okay

1494
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:17,448
down there with the doc?

1495
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,450
- Fulton will be okay anywhere,
Dave.

1496
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:22,453
- We'll cover the Aquarius Lounge,
okay Chief?

1497
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:25,080
- Okay I'll stay here, you guys keep
your eyes peeled huh?

1498
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,373
- Right Chief.

1499
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,106
H9)'-

1500
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,402
I thought the chief was gonna
cover the Rainbow Room.

1501
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,446
- And here's the
hilarious comedy team

1502
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,364
you've all been waiting for folks.

1503
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,616
Direct from sunny Miami Beach,

1504
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:03,369
the Laugh Gators from Comedy Box,

1505
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,412
Lou Marsh and Tony Adams.

1506
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:14,713
- Holy cow.

1507
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:15,756
- Did you get hurt?

1508
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:16,799
- Huh? - Did you get hurt?

1509
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,384
- Are they laughing? - No.

1510
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:19,592
- I got hurt, that didn't
feel too good at all.

1511
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:20,677
- Hey what did you think of
Scotty's beard.

1512
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:21,970
Isn't that beautiful. -
Yeah he looks great.

1513
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:22,554
You look like an armpit with eyes.

1514
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,057
- Hey this is a great audience.

1515
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:26,433
- Great audience, so glad we came.

1516
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:27,559
- Hey what were you
doing back there?

1517
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:28,560
- Where, back there? - Uh huh.

1518
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:29,477
- Oh did you see the pretty girls

1519
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:30,229
that are ready to come out here?

1520
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:31,647
- They're beautiful.

1521
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:32,564
- Tall blonde, I was talking to one
of the tall blondes,

1522
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:33,565
blue eyes, gorgeous, pretty.

1523
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,107
- What did she say?

1524
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:34,899
- Nope.

1525
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,321
- I'm gonna talk to the chief.

1526
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:40,656
- Hey what were you talking to
Sherwood Gates about?

1527
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:41,657
- Sherwood Gates? - Right.

1528
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:43,701
- Oh, we joined a new club.

1529
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,535
It's called the Prostitute
Club of America.

1530
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:46,996
- There's no such thing as a
prostitute club.

1531
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,580
- See you get excited right away.

1532
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:49,497
There's no such thing. -
There's no such thing--

1533
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:50,707
- What are you yelling for,

1534
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:51,916
I got the card right in my pocket.

1535
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:53,543
- That's not even legal.

1536
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:54,837
- I got the card right here,
Sherwood Gates gave it to me.

1537
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,505
He was back there, and said you
wanna join a club.

1538
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:57,714
- Prostitute Club of America.

1539
01:17:58,048 --> 01:17:58,715
- Why don't you get eyeglasses?

1540
01:17:59,049 --> 01:17:59,674
- What do I need eyeglasses for?

1541
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:01,260
- That's the Parachute Club.

1542
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,056
- Holy cow, I signed up
for 22 jumps.

1543
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:07,432
- Chief, Chief.

1544
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:13,146
I thought you were gonna keep a
look out at the bar.

1545
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,356
Listen, I have a problem.

1546
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:18,568
My girl's on board.

1547
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:22,448
Well I'm worried she might spot me
in the contest tonight.

1548
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:23,823
What do you think?

1549
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:29,371
It doesn't worry you?

1550
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,790
If you're not worried, I'm
not going to worry.

1551
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:34,209
Hey what do you think.

1552
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,461
You think I stand a chance of
winning the contest?

1553
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:42,133
Good deal Chief.

1554
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,595
You know I think we're
gonna nail Vito

1555
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:49,391
and them rotten
bastards to the wall.

1556
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,684
See you later.

1557
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:58,900
- One I gotta tell ya, one day
we get this call,

1558
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,152
says come on up to the
hotel right away,

1559
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:01,778
there's a man and a woman,
they're embraced,

1560
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:02,654
they're in the nude, they're dead,
measure them,

1561
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,322
and get them the hell outta here.

1562
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:05,908
So we went up to measure em, here
to here, here to here,

1563
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:07,701
we took this mallet to
separate them,

1564
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:09,786
boom, biggest fight you ever
saw in your life.

1565
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:10,703
- What was the fight about?

1566
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:11,621
- We were in the wrong room.

1567
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:14,708
We were in the wrong room.

1568
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,626
- There ain't no sign of
them no where's.

1569
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:18,545
- Hey Paco. - Huh?

1570
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,213
- See that broad over there.

1571
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,548
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1572
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:24,801
The senorita with the
flower in her head.

1573
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:28,513
That's the doll that's going to win
the contest tonight.

1574
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:29,639
- What are you talking about.

1575
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,684
I'm gonna win the contest.

1576
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,436
- You couldn't win a
ribbon at a dog show.

1577
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,772
So shut up before I belt ya.

1578
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,316
- What, just because some
floozy comes along,

1579
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,276
and what did she do Vito?

1580
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,570
Make promises to you, huh?

1581
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:47,532
She made promises to my big brother.

1582
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:49,033
Just to win the contest.

1583
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:50,786
I know her type.

1584
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,082
- Paco, see the senorita gets to
win the contest huh.

1585
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:59,002
'Cause then she gets to wear
the crown right.

1586
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,378
- Right, right.

1587
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,465
- Ah let her go.

1588
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:06,677
Come here.

1589
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,513
That chick is a cop.

1590
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,433
An undercover agent.

1591
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:18,855
So you tell Gates, that she's

01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:19,409
Until a jealous
competitor assaulted her.

1771
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:21,953
Beat her with a stick.

1772
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:22,912
- Sherwood.

1773
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:25,581
She has my crown.

1774
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:29,752
- She suffered brain damage,

1775
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,381
which caused these
terrible seizures.

1776
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:36,300
These awful fits of violence.

1777
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:37,551
- If you loved her so much Gates

1778
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,554
why didn't you take her to a doctor?

1779
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:40,430
- Doctor?

1780
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:42,806
- I did.

1781
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:44,183
Doctor Ravenna.

1782
01:32:45,518 --> 01:32:48,395
He told Vito Vito the whole story.

1783
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:52,734
Later he repented, became
remorseful and maudlin.

1784
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:54,861
Tried to save himself, but
it was too late.

1785
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:55,737
- Doctor.

1786
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,572
I don't understand.

1787
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:00,700
I don't know any doctor.

1788
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,577
- Vito was on my back.

1789
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,037
Blackmailing me.

1790
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,121
I was smuggling his cocaine for him,

1791
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:09,709
using my boat for his
filthy contraband.

1792
01:33:10,043 --> 01:33:12,211
What recourse did I have?

1793
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,547
Send Lucy to an institution.

1794
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:15,548
I couldn't,

1795
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:16,632
even

1796
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:17,925
do that.

1797
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:21,262
- So you let her kill
three girls instead?

1798
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,389
- She enjoys it.

1799
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:24,849
Some people play hockey-

1800
01:33:25,183 --> 01:33:25,933
Others fish.

1801
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:28,895
I admit it's not very nice.

1802
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:30,855
I wouldn't dream of doing it myself.

1803
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:32,607
But for Lucy it's relaxing.

1804
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:33,900
And necessary.

1805
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,068
Besides,

1806
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:38,737
I can afford it.

1807
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:43,451
- Tell her to take off my
crown Sherwood.

1808
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:45,328
Tell her to take it off.

1809
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:48,373
- I believe she wants you to
take off the crown.

1810
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:50,040
- Take off my crown.

1811
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:54,920
- Gates you're not going to
let this happen.

1812
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:55,797
You can't!

1813
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,258
- I'm the queen.

1814
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:00,759
I'm the only queen.

1815
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,430
- Sorry Lucy but you're not
the only queen.

1816
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:11,270
- A pervert, a pervert on my ship.

1817
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:15,566
- You tricked me Sherwood.

1818
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:16,567
I hate you.

1819
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:18,318
- No my darling.

1820
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:19,528
- You tricked me!

1821
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:20,822
- No!

1822
01:34:44,929 --> 01:34:47,306
- Sherwood my darling.

1823
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,807
- Dave, you okay?

1824
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,685
- Yeah, yeah I'm okay.

1825
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,666
- Dave's the one you've been
hearing and reading about

1826
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,584
all over town folks.

1827
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:17,128
- Not just me.

1828
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:19,464
- He's the police detective
who disguised himself

1829
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:22,341
as a beauty contestant in
order to investigate

1830
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:24,718
the artists and models murdered case

1831
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,721
and investigate he did.

1832
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:31,476
In fact he unearthed not
only the murderer

1833
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:34,645
but an entire ring of
coke smugglers.

1834
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,691
Wow, that must have been
pretty scary huh Dave.

1835
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:40,276
- No Jen, you see

1836
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:42,612
the thing is that I worked on
the inside of Faith

1837
01:35:42,946 --> 01:35:44,405
and I really didn't get to
see how it looked

1838
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,365
so I just did my job you
know what I mean.

1839
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:47,700
- No.

1840
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:49,452
- Well what I mean is that
there are some people

1841
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:51,746
that I'm sure were affected and
perhaps they had some sort

1842
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,749
of an identity crisis as a result of

1843
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:57,752
my masquerading as Faith but uh

1844
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,629
I never really personally felt

1845
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:00,797
any sort of crisis at all.

1846
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:01,797
- Can we go now?

1847
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:04,049
- Well thank you Dave and Cookie.

1848
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:08,554
Now we're going to say a few words
to Dave's partner Casey.

1849
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:10,264
What was your name sir?

1850
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:11,807
- Who wants to know?

1851
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:13,809
- My name's Kiki Donahue,

1852
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,603
and next year I'm gonna
be a contestant

1853
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,231
in the Artisan Models Beauty Ball.

1854
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:20,649
- No you ain't.

1855
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:21,859
- Yes I am.

1856
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,027
- You ain't.

1857
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,195
- Yes I am.

1858
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:25,279
- You ain't.

1859
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:29,741
Stop that, did you see him?

1860
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,160
Did any of you see him?

1861
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:33,370
I'll put you all in the ground.
