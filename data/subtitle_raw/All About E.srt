You must really work out.

Not that much.

00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,191
I could make an exception to

Right.

00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,613
Stunning as always, eh, hen?

28
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,317
OK, it's a new theme -
Arabian Nights.

29
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,120
It's gonna be a smash.
Matt's drawings are brilliant.

00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,222
Here is me as The Sheikh.

Och, not this towel-head thing
again.

32
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,729
Stick to the Spanish theme.
The punters love it.

33
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,632
Let's leave the Arabs
out of it, eh?

34
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,267
Och, come on, now, hen.

35
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,504
Have we not got a winner here
with the Spanish thing?

36
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,774
Yeah, but it's not really me,
Johnny.

37
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,077
Dinnae mess with it
till I say so, eh?

38
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,745
Now...

39
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,949
..was there anything
you wanted to tell me,

40
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,285
anything you think
ah should know?

41
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,354
You mean, the gig at Ice?

42
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,391
Well, aren't we
the popular one, then?

43
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,228
I suppose it's too much to ask
for a wee bit of loyalty.

44
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,331
Oh, come on!
Don't be like that, Johnny.

45
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,299
You know you'll always be
number one.

46
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:09,569
Aye, I know I will. And
that is why I took the liberty

47
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,272
of telling those lads at Ice
that you were nae available.

48
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,774
- You can't do that!
- Who took a risk

49
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,777
on a wee, Leb naebody
from the Gong,

50
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:23,550
turned her into the top DJ?

51
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:30,757
Now, I'm thinking, we need
a coffee and a catch-up...

52
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,762
..just you and me,
like old times.

53
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,998
- Sure, but I don't...
- And in future,

54
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,666
you ask your Uncle Johnny

55
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,302
before you go taking gigs
from other people.

56
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,104
Is that too much to ask?

57
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,705
Of course not, Johnny.

58
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,574
Now you give your Uncle Johnny
a kiss,

59
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,243
and then you two can piss off,
eh?

Hello there, John boy.

00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,685
Someone once said

108
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:58,825
I'm like an Irish version
of Robert Pattinson.

You?

Liar, liar, pants on fire.

111
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,805
I'm a bit old-fashioned.

112
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,509
Can we chat a bit more
before we meet?

113
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,717
- Elmira?
- Mrs Malouf.

114
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,554
It's me, Matt. Matthew.

115
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,088
Elmira?

116
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,424
No, she's in the shower.

- Your mother.
- What does she want?

121
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,972
What does she want
every Saturday when she calls?

122
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,607
That I don't exist.

123
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,945
You back on the chat room
again?

124
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,914
No!

125
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,184
How else
am I supposed to find a man?

126
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,588
Not by pretending you have
amazing abs, that's for sure.

127
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,223
Outrageous!
Speaking of outrageous,

128
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,092
what are we going to do
about Johnny?

129
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,628
Look, I know he gets
a little bit over the top.

130
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,798
Over the top?
Psychopathic, more like.

131
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,936
We have to leave, E.
Ice really want us.

132
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,206
They'll let us do Arabian
Nights. Whatever we want.

133
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,675
Jaki heard that Johnny
threatened to firebomb them

134
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,812
- if we play there.
- Fuck, E!

135
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,914
What is it with you and him?

136
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,184
Stop. Make it bigger.

137
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,821
Who's that blonde tart?

138
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,190
It's the barmaid from Ice.

139
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,193
Ice♪Those fucking towelheads.

140
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,330
Shite! That's E.

141
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,132
It is too.

142
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,234
Boss,
you can't think E's involved?

143
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,970
There's no way
she'd do that to me.

144
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,713
Oh. Looks like
Johnny's ears are burning.

145
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,083
Jesus, E!
It's my fecking birthday.

146
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,219
D'you think we can just last
one day without

147
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,655
talking to that psycho
scrooge uncle of yours?

148
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,858
OK, I'm all yours. It's off.

149
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,893
Let's go. I need a coffee.

150
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,164
Come on, come on.

151
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,367
Come on, come on, come on.

152
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,603
Hey, this is E.
You know what...

153
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,312
In your pigsty, please.

154
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,783
Not mine.

155
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,751
Well, it's not mine.

156
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,353
Well, it's not mine.

157
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,355
Well, it's not mine!

158
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,466
We are so in the money!

159
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,601
Where did it come from?

160
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,870
Who cares?

161
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,505
Well, how much is here?

162
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,641
Listen, E,
what happened last night?

163
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,276
Nothing.

164
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,445
Jaki and I were wasted,
so we caught a taxi.

165
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,513
Which taxi?
We have to give it back.

166
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,715
Are you crazy?

167
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,783
- I'm calling the police.
- No you're not.

168
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,785
Give it! Matt!

169
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,725
Who is it?

170
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,229
We're collecting for
the Give a Girl a Go appeal.

171
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,100
Kylie and Tanya.

173
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,940
Ah, here you go, girls.

174
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,309

Tightarse.

Here! You girls are
doing a great job.

177
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,321
Think! In a bag like this,
this much cash.

178
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,390
Do you think that a) the taxi
driver who gave you a lift

179
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,159
is just some eccentric
millionaire

180
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,827
who's driving his taxi
for kicks?

181
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,496
No. I didn't think so either.

182
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,764
Or what do you think,

183
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,133
is it actually b) some
son-of-a-gun drug dealer

184
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,502
who's a little too smashed
on his own merchandise

185
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,037
to realise he's mislaid
a small matter of, what,

186
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,706
say, half a million
in used 50s?

187
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,808
So why don't we keep it?

188
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,812
No! Because that taxi driver
is probably

189
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,381
navigating under water
as we speak,

190
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,617
and I tell you, I cannot swim!

191
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,253
Calm the fuck down.

192
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,822
No-one knows that
we have this.

193
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,294
They find the taxi driver,
they find us.

194
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,197
I want it out of the house
now. Bad karma!

195
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,000
Come on, Matt. You want
to leave Johnny, right?

196
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,946
Oh, my God!

197
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,581
Of course!

198
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,724
Fuck.

199
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,015
He didn't leave anything!

200
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,784
You've got the wrong man!

201
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,619
I didn't find anything!

202
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,224
No, wait, no!

203
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,926
Boss?

204
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,240
Why do you have to bullshit
everyone?

205
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,642
- I didn't.
- Oh, for sure.

206
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,478
The flowers were for me!

207
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,448
Yoo-hoo! Mr and Mrs Toreador.

208
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,316
Hi, girls.

209
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,051
Hi, Mitze, Kitty.

210
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,486
Matt and his machine.

211
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,222
You can always tell a man
by what he rides.

212
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,925
Hey, arse fuckers!
Old, fucking fags!

213
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,694
- What the fuck is that?
- Waste of a good Holden.

214
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:10,630
Piss off and leave us alone.

215
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,466
Suck my dick,
ya fuckin' dyke.

216
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,636
- My pleasure, darling...
- Wa-hey!

217
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,805
..if I could find
the tiny thing, I so would.

218
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,774
What did he say to me?

219
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,249
Psycho bitch! Fuck off!

220
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,720
You OK, girls?

221
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,723
Aren't you
a little Ninja Turtle?

222
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,159
Just young boys, letting off
a bit of steam, darl.

223
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,662
I'm sure I fucked
one of those boys last month.

224
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,499
I need a drink. Come on.
Bye, Matt.

225
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,134
Bye, E.

226
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,975
Fuck! Oh, my God.

227
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,386
What the fuck?

228
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,822
Do you know
how much these cost now?

229
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,024
Oh, he must have every model!

230
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,594
Come on!

231
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,464
- You didn't lock the door.
- Me♪You were last to leave.

232
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,740
Shit! Shit.

233
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,242
You said nobody knew.
We have to go to the police.

234
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:33,245
Stop screaming.
I'm trying to think.

235
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,948
I'm sure that car
is following us.

236
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,718
Ohh.

237
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,920
A mother and two kids♪Yeah.

238
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,455
We just need to find someone

239
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,123
who'll put us up
for a couple of days

240
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,125
while we work out what to do,
OK?

241
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,329
What about Leonora,
my old landlady?

242
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,999
We are not
that desperate.

243
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh!

244
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,870
Who is this girl?

245
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:01,741
She was a beachside romance.
She really loves me.

246
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,119
Well! That went well.

247
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,798
Mum!

248
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,301
Dad!

249
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,971
She said
she was a bit confused.

250
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,606
Not anymore.

251
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,344
Hey, Lou.

252
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,548
It's been over a year.

253
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,518
Wait - I've got your money.

254
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,987
- 700.

255
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,889
Plus 100 to say thanks.

256
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,427
Took you long enough. What
happened, you rob a bank?

257
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,168
Look, the thing is, Lou,
we need a place to stay,

258
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,803
just for a few days.

259
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:07,206
- I don't think that's a g...
- Habibti.

260
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,009
You know I wouldn't ask
unless it was urgent.

261
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:16,649
Nah, nah. My mum was right
about you. You're trouble, E.

262
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,754
If we're finished with those
people you've dumped, ignored

263
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:25,391
or fought with, we might have
no other alternative.

264
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,593
You said she was
a total fruit loop.

265
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,129
Well, that doesn't mean
she can't be trusted.

266
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,966
I had a feeling
you'd be coming.

267
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,634
Many happy returns.

268
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,672
Don't ask.

269
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,676
Leonora. Leonora Laventallini.

270
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,077
E. Just E.

271
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,247
Well, that's short
and to the point. Come in.

272
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,119
This is you,
the Page of Cups -

273
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,722
beautiful, artistic,
emotional...

274
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,291
..deep.

275
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,828
But reversed,
this is the immature card.

276
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,864
I could have told you that.

277
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,802
More Swords behind you.

278
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,540
Great loss or heartbreak.

279
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,877
- Her younger brother.
- Matt, don't.

280
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,180
Michael. He was only 17.
Killed - drunk driver.

281
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,315
- Terrible!
- Matt, shut up!

282
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,551
This doesn't feel like a man.

283
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,954
- This feels like a woman.
- OK.

284
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,357
We don't have time
for this psychic babble.

285
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,992
E! How can you be so rude?

286
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,527
Can we borrow your car?

287
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,671
Shite, shite!
What are we going to do, E?

288
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,240
Why don't we ask Johnny?
He knows all the heavies.

289
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,376
Stop running to feckin Johnny
all the time.

290
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,611
I'm just saying
he'd know what to do.

291
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,314
What a grand idea... Let's go
live with Uncle Johnny.

292
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,449
You got any better ideas?

293
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,121
What about Bali,
or Shanghai?

294
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,025
My one and only chance
to travel first-class...

295
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,393
How was I supposed to know

296
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,028
you need ID
for domestic travel?

297
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,397
You went to college!
I rely on you.

298
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,266
Well, you shouldn't!
I dropped out.

299
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,938
Hey, this is E.

300
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,343
- Elmira?
- Hi, Mumma. It's me.

301
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:27,179
Matt and I were thinking
of visiting you and Dad.

302
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:29,281
We... we could come now,
really.

303
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,973
Clarinet Concerto

304
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:22,434
Penny for them?

305
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,406
It'll cost you.

306
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,675
Oh, really♪How much?

307
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,480
You can't afford it.

308
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,082
Says who, Princess?

309
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,917
- Princess?!
- Yeah!

310
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:41,687
- Says me, Skippy!
- We'll see about that!

311
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,289
Move in with me.

312
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,091
What?

313
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,595
Move in with me.

314
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,398
Really?

315
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,033
Really.

316
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,040
OK.

317
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,280
Jaysus! Can we not
play something else?

318
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:11,784

he's being strangled.

Ow! What was that for?

320
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,324
Kenny G plays the sax,
not the clarinet.

00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,169
Who answered your phone.
You have visitor?

358
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:20,172
No, that's Trish.
You know, my flatmate.

359
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:23,041
I have some
very important news.

360
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,243
Your cousin Darina,

361
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,712
she christen the baby Michael
on the 30th.

362
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,248
I didn't think
she talked to you.

363
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:33,352
This time we invited. We come
to Sydney for three days.

364
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,522
The church, a big party
afterwards - everybody coming.

365
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,024
The 30th for three days.

366
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,692
Who you talking to?

367
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:45,864
You no want us to come?
I'm not staying with Darina.

368
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,201
No, Mumma,
of course you can stay.

369
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,938
Trish will be away that
weekend, won't you, Trish?

370
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,782
Mumma, I'm going to have
to call you back.

371
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,187
- Hey.
- Don't.

372
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,925
What could I do?

373
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,128
I don't know.

374
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,763
You could say no.

375
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,266
You could say,
'Let me just ask Trish.

376
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,468
She really hates it
when I take all of her stuff

377
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,404
out of our room
and puts it in the lounge

378
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,005
like she's the bloody lodger.

379
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,675
- It's not like that.
- You could even say,

380
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,845
'My beautiful lover and I have
our anniversary that weekend,

381
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,081
and it's really important.'

382
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,053
I'm really sorry.

383
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,690
You know how crazy
she makes me.

384
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,626
Yeah, I do,
but I thought just this once

385
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,895
you could think of me, of us.

386
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,198
- I do!
- So tell them.

387
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,669
You're ashamed, aren't you?

388
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,544
You're a coward, E.

389
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,513
You're a fucking coward.

390
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,758
Is my tattoo covered?

391
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,960
Uh-huh.

392
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,029
Do I look straight?

393
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,800
Now?

394
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,205
Now?

395
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,076
Now?

396
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,414
Alright, wifey,
let's go face the music.

397
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,461
You never come to see us.
You ring us three hours ago.

398
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,364
Where you been♪Your father
and I been worried sick.

399
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:02,100
Mumma, relax. We're here now.

400
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,935
Mrs Malouf...

401
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:07,372
The food is almost ruined.
Come, we eat now.

402
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,575
Red hair!
How can you do this to us?

403
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,748
Habibti, we miss you.

404
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,284
Me too, Dad.

405
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,019
You, you come with me.

406
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,426
Mr Malouf.

407
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,428
Joseph.

408
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:32,364
Sorry - Joseph.

409
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,533
How's it going,
mate?

410
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,269
Good, thanks.

411
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:41,573
You come, no warning.
We have no food in the house.

412
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,478
Why we have to have
this emergency meeting,

413
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,680
like you have
emergency wedding, huh?

414
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,049
I still can't believe you
thought I was pregnant.

415
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,852
Don't eat! Cut some onion.
We need more onion.

416
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,489
Oh, that's...

417
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,295
- I... I take this.
- Oh no!

418
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,131
No, it's alright.

419
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,766
Sit, sit.

420
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:17,309
Why you marry this fat man
with red hair?

421
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:21,847
Mum! He's not fat,
and he's not deaf.

422
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:25,183
And why you wear your hair
like this?

423
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,052
And why you choose him

424
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,721
when you could have that boy,
Khabbaz?

425
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:31,389
'Cause he's a pig,
that's why.

426
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,558
Cut the bread,
we need more bread.

427
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,963
What about your music?

428
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,265
You fail your exam.
Everybody know.

429
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,167
They say,
'Why she leave university?'

430
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,503
Your brother never do this
to us!

431
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,272
Yeah. He just stole cars
and didn't finish high school

432
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,874
but he's still Saint Michael.

433
00:31:48,974 --> 00:31:52,410
You shame us.

434
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,746
We already live with
so much shame.

435
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,089
Elmira.

436
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:08,827
You proper musician.
You can work in the orchestra,

437
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:13,732
teach music, get proper job.
Your teacher say so.

438
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,234
I tried, and it's not me,
Mumma.

439
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,805
No?

440
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:22,007
Who you, Elmira?

441
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,909
Who you are?

442
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,415
All my life I work hard
for you to go to university,

443
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,318
but you! It gets too hard,
you just throw it all away.

444
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,721
Poof! Like that! Like it's
nothing, like we nothing.

445
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,490
How can you say that?

446
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,493
Ever since you a little girl,
you like this, stubborn!

447
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,229
No respect.

448
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,998
Your father and I,
we give you everything.

449
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,168
We have you, we get married.
I don't sing anymore.

450
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,171
I never asked you to have me.

451
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,028
Umi...

452
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:24,302
You and me, we're not
too different, you know.

453
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:26,705
You reckon?

454
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:30,742
You make my stomach very bad
from what you do to us.

455
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,278
- Dr Nassar...
- What does he say?

456
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:37,215
He say my ulcer is back.
Is very bad.

457
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,151
I go back to hospital
if I not careful,

458
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,786
if I get upset.

459
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,225
Alright Umi.

460
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,694
You can have a huge party
for us.

461
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,397
Invite every single cousin
we have.

462
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,999
You play clarinet for us?

463
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,568
I haven't played
in over a year.

464
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,208
OK.

465
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,444
Just tonight,
give Matt a chance.

466
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,584
A fat chance, huh♪

467
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,725
Whew!

468
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,560
What's this called again?

469
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:25,730
- Arak.
- Ah, is the milk of the lion.

470
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,934
It's very special. It's from
my brother in Lebanon.

471
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:32,537
- It's lethal.
- It suits this kitty cat.

472
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,140
I'm just saying, what we do
in Ireland in the country

473
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,741
is sing and dance.

474
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,710
Lord of the Riverdance,
that's me.

475
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,345
I love to dance.

476
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:44,015
I used to dance all the time
in the club in Beirut.

477
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,952
I bet you cut a fine figure on
the dance floor, Mrs Malouf.

478
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,989
I better singer,
ah, a long time ago.

479
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,124
You show us this dancing.

480
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:56,962
Er... I don't think
that's such a great idea.

481
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,264
How about a song for us,
Mrs Malouf?

482
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,467
Please,
you leave this man alone.

483
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,371
Your father, he doesn't like
singing or dancing.

484
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,107
But you listen to me -
he used to like it

485
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,742
before everything change.

486
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,711
Nadine!

487
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:16,514
No, you cooked.
Let me clean up.

488
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,483
No, I do. You guest.

489
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,118
No, I insist.

490
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,253
- We do together.
- Together!

491
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,122
Together, together.

492
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:28,960
- ♪Oh, Danny boy...
- Oh, you sing!

493
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,364
Your mother never sing
anymore.

494
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,200
You upset her.

495
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,168
Since the day I was born.

496
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,276
Oh, my God.

497
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,412
Please tell me
your mother gave you those.

498
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,681
Fabulous.

499
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,061
What?
Even though we're married?

500
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,163
They don't like you that much.

501
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,182
Do you not miss it?

502
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,152
Nah. Being a DJ's much cooler.

503
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,358
Especially
when dressed by MOI!

504
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,207
Clarinet Concerto in A Minor

505
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,378
Aye,
that sounds like an OK deal,

506
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,280
but what are
your delivery times?

507
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,282
I need this lot fast.

508
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,317
OK.

509
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:07,585
We'll get to the bit

510
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,255
where I cut your toes off
fairly soon now,

511
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:13,124
so you'll maybe be wanting
to try and remember where

512
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,059
that bitch has taken ma money,
eh?

513
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,228
I swear, I don't know!

514
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,100
Check the
wee bitch's phone.

515
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,704
Elmira♪It's for you - a man.

You get my cash here by nine,

525
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,767
Matt! Get up. It's Johnny,
it's Johnny's money.

526
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,035
He knows where we are.

527
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:00,471
- We need to leave now.
- What♪Oh, my God!

528
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,407
Oh, sweet Jesus!

529
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,609
But why we have
to leave now?

530
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,312
I no like Ali.
He is a bad man.

531
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,848
He's got bad friends,
he smoke bad cigarettes.

532
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,984
- Exactly.
- He can't cook!

533
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,054
- We stay here.
- Mumma, you can't stay here.

534
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,856
Dad, please tell her.
You have to go to Ali.

535
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,892
- Tell him there's trouble.
- Enough!

536
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:23,695
We will go.

537
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,763
Dad, I'm so sorry.

538
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:29,334
Is for you, for later.

539
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,969
Let's go.

540
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,549
I knew this was too good
to be true.

541
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,351
We have to give it back, E.

542
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,587
- No, we don't.
- What?

543
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,257
He thinks he's in charge
of everything,

544
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,125
can control everyone.

545
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,394
Well, he's about to find out
he's wrong.

546
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,996
Are you crazy?

547
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,632
He had no right to cancel Ice.

548
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,267
Let him stew.

549
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,270
It's not like he can go to the
police and report it missing.

550
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,705
No, but he can kill us.

551
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,974
Not if he can't find us.

552
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,751
Do you think your parents
will be OK?

553
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,386
Yeah. Ali's a thug.

554
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:58,589
If anyone can handle Johnny,
he can.

555
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:01,326
I wish we'd given it
to the police.

556
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,361
Then Johnny really would
kill us.

557
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,963
I still don't get you and him.

558
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:08,199
OK, so you don't get it.

559
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,834
Nobody does.

560
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,755
Hey.

561
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:35,026
You know, I still don't know
why all of Row 4 have died.

562
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,894
It should be a good mix.

563
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:41,532
- I got it, Trish.
- Got what?

564
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,102
Johnny's given me top billing.

565
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,037
You're looking at
the new resident DJ

566
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,638
for Saturday nights.

567
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,274
Don't you have clarinet
quartet on Saturday nights?

568
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:52,443
No biggie.
They can find someone else.

569
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,178
I thought you said
they'd fail you

570
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:56,781
if you didn't play
in the quartet?

571
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:00,184
Maybe I don't want
to play the clarinet anymore.

572
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,553
You're joking?

573
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,222
This is my chance.

574
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,991
Johnny says that I'm the best
DJ he's seen in years.

575
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,193
I could be really big.

576
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,462
Why can't you be happy for me?

577
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:15,099
I can,
if it's what you really want.

578
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,902
- It is.
- I don't believe you.

579
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,771
Well, it's the truth.

580
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,106
I don't want
to play the clarinet anymore.

581
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:28,179
Jaysus, E! Pull in!
You're not fit to drive.

582
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,448
And I could eat a small child.

583
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,085
I need a hangover cure!

584
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,971
Well, what d'ya think?

585
00:42:55,873 --> 00:43:00,478
Don't ask me, then. Furthest
I've ever been is Bondi Beach.

586
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:06,384
Hm...and one time when I went

weekend. One word - disaster.

the caged bear sings,

590
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,908
What about taking
Arabian Nights to Melbourne?

591
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,210
Mm.

You have no idea
what it's like to be me.

596

I didn't mean it like that.

What did they want?

One was Scottish, or Irish.
Bloody rude, if you ask me.
