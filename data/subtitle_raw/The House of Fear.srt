1
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,915
The events I'm
about to relate

2
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,647
began a fortnight ago.

3
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,949
In a grim old house

4
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,183
perched high on a cliff

5
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,384
on the west coast
of Scotland.

6
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,155
This singular
structure is known as

7
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,719
Driercliff House.

8
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,129
Gathered there for dinner

9
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,895
were the seven members

10
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,028
of a most
extraordinary club

11
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,972
called the Good Comrades.

12
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,509
Into this unique gathering

13
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,909
came their melancholy
housekeeper,

14
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,674
Mrs. Monteith

15
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,772
bearing a message

16
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,511
for Ralph King,

17
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,712
a retired barrister.

18
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,419
King received it casually.

19
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,296
When they saw
the contents,

20
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,737
the Good Comrades took
the whole thing as a joke

21
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,071
but their
housekeeper was right,

22
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,874
it was no laughing matter.

23
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,471
For on the
following night...

24
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,628
Ralph King died horribly

25
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,756
but this was only
the beginning.

26
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,127
A few nights later

27
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,537
as the Good
Comrades gathered

28
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,371
to drink a final toast

29
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,105
to their departed member...

30
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,696
Mrs. Monteith entered

31
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,736
with a second envelope.

32
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:28,240
This time addressed
to Stanley Raeburn.

33
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,935
In his day

34
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,739
a distinguished actor.

35
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,218
This time you may be sure

36
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,813
there was no laughter.

37
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,292
These men were afraid

38
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:52,263
and their fear
was justified.

39
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,798
For once again the
message proved to be

40
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,862
a portent of death.

41
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,635
It was ten days

42
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,610
before Raeburn's battered
body was recovered.

43
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,373
Hum, tell Mr. Chalmers

44
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,142
what do these
envelopes contain?

45
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,546
In the first case,

46
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,346
seven orange
pips, or seeds.

47
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,817
In the second case six.

48
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,786
And the number
of orange pips

49
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,413
refer to the
surviving members,

50
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,082
a grim warning,
hey Holmes?

51
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,591
Looks like murder.

52
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,753
Not necessarily, Watson.

53
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,194
A moment ago

54
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,459
you referred to this club
as extraordinary, why?

55
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,092
All of the members
are past middle age,

56
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,534
retired and
without near kin.

57
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,037
Six months ago

58
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,471
they formed this
club here in London

59
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,132
and promptly left
for Driercliff,

60
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,473
the ancestral home of
a Mr. Bruce Alastair,

61
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,409
their eldest member.

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,345
Nothing there
remarkable about that,

63
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,713
sounds rather friendly
as a matter of fact.

64
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,217
The remarkable fact is

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,548
that all seven
of these men

66
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,554
appear to have but
one thing in common.

67
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,021
Huh, well what's that?

68
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,421
Elementary, my
dear Watson,

69
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,483
each is worth a great
deal more dead than alive.

70
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,720
That's right Mr. Holmes.

71
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,887
How did you guess?

72
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,863
My dear Mr. Chalmers,
you represent

73
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,592
the Association of
Insurance Underwriters,

74
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,191
you're worried about
the untimely deaths

75
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,860
of these two
Good Comrades.

76
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,733
Ergo these men must carry

77
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,238
rather large
insurance policies.

78
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,332
Yes, but that's not all.

79
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,877
Shortly after
forming this club

80
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,071
all these seven men
changed their policies

81
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,672
making the other members
their beneficiaries.

82
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,307
The policy's total

83
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,249
are over a hundred
thousand pounds.

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,787
Oh, it's very
enlightening.

85
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,048
You've paid the five
surviving members

86
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,783
on the policies of
King and Raeburn?

87
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,484
Oh yes, we always
pay promptly

88
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,493
but what worries
me, Mr. Holmes, is...

89
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,892
Whether these two deaths

90
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:30,758
were accidental or not.

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,320
Exactly.

92
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,558
Of course I may be wrong,

93
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,964
I have no proof

94
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,365
but it seems to me
to be just possible

95
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,733
that one of these men

96
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,294
plans to murder the
others one by one.

97
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,930
And collect on
all the policies.

98
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,497
I see the whole
thing, Holmes.

99
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,133
Bravo Watson but
why the orange pips?

100
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,507
Oh yes, the orange pips.

101
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,909
Pips Watson?

102
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,310
Bit of a puzzler,
hey Holmes?

103
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,370
Quite.

104
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,110
Most intriguing feature.

105
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,446
Any tobacco
around this place.

106
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,746
After all Mr. Holmes,

107
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,151
several lives
may be at stake.

108
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,882
The temptation of
sudden wealth could...

109
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,082
Could,

110
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,351
could possibly
turn one of these

111
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,483
seemingly harmless men

112
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,618
into a ruthless killer.

113
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,854
Exactly.

114
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,089
Are those the
Good Comrades?

115
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,289
Yes.

116
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,526
Let me see them will you?

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,966
Hello.

118
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,469
Who's this fellow
on the end?

119
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,095
That's Doctor Merrivale.

120
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,403
Doctor Simon Merrivale?

121
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,603
I believe his
Christian name is Simon.

122
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,306
Yes, definitely
Doctor Simon Merrivale.

123
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,973
I'll accept your
case, Mr. Chalmers.

124
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,038
Watson pack your things

125
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,379
were off to
Scotland tonight.

126
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,267
Scotland, home
of my ancestors.

127
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,067
A lonely land but
a peaceful one.

128
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,166
It's wonderful after
stuffy London, hey Holmes?

129
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,337
I say who is this
Doctor Merrivale?

130
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,779
Oh well, if you want
to behave like a clam,

131
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,316
you have not uttered a
word since we left London.

132
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,579
Sorry old fellow,
I was thinking.

133
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,177
Twenty years ago
Doctor Merrivale

134
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,223
was a famous surgeon
on Harley Street.

135
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,349
Can't be so very famous,
I never heard of him.

136
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,688
Oh but he was.

137
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,625
His main claim to
distinction, of course,

138
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,322
was the unnecessarily
brutal murder

139
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,489
of a young bride.

140
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,862
Really?

141
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,127
However, he testified

142
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,463
so brilliantly
on the witness box

143
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:17,969
that he was acquitted

144
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,505
after which he dropped
completely out of sight.

145
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,200
And you think that

146
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,902
he was most probably
responsible

147
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,466
for the death of these
two Good Comrades?

148
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,876
Well I don't
say that he was

149
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,504
but I do say that
he could have been.

150
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,208
Murder is an
insidious thing, Watson.

151
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,615
Once a man has dipped
his fingers in blood

152
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,916
sooner or later he'll feel
the urge to kill again.

153
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,616
Oh gracious me
very unpleasant.

154
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,805
Funeral home.

155
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,344
You suppose were too late?

156
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,936
Oh I think your

157
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,344
unnecessarily
suspicious, Watson.

158
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,939
One of the villagers hey?

159
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,381
Aye sir.

160
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,884
Mr. MacTavis
the blacksmith.

161
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,716
Now daughter, don't be
talking to strangers.

162
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,119
Wasn't her fault.

163
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,884
I asked your daughter
whose funeral it was.

164
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,585
Andy MacTavis,

165
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,923
cut down in the
flower of his manhood.

166
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,257
What a pity.

167
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,558
A young fellow huh?

168
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,223
Just seventy-two.

169
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,732
Seventy-two?

170
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,701
Flower of his manhood,
trying to be funny?

171
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,963
Come on, Watson.

172
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,937
Oh seventy-two,
flower of his manhood.

173
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,974
I've seen about
forty men...

174
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,703
Can I help you gentlemen?

175
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,438
I telegraphed for
reservations from London.

176
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,378
Name sir?

177
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,972
Sherlock Holmes
and Doctor Watson.

178
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,539
We have your
rooms ready then.

179
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,812
Thank you.

180
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,784
Sign there gentlemen.

181
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,053
Yes indeed.

182
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,788
Are you staying
long gentlemen?

183
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,557
No, not long.

184
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,599
We just came up here
to look into the...

185
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,361
we just came up here
for the shooting.

186
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,765
Shooting?

187
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,463
Yes grouse of course.

188
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,937
No grouse here sir

189
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,735
for the last forty years.

190
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,399
No grouse?

191
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,943
Cheer up Watson.

192
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,743
You'll find some other
query to occupy our time.

193
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,077
This way gentlemen.

194
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,378
Take the gun will you?

195
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,611
Take the big bag.

196
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,000
So you're back

197
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,507
earlier than usual
Doctor Merrivale.

198
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,736
Gentlemen

199
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,641
I've just made a rather
intriguing discovery.

200
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,009
The village of Inverness

201
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,513
has a
distinguished visitor.

202
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,310
Huh?

203
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,212
Really?

204
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,545
Who?

205
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,744
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

206
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,843
Who?

207
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,478
I didn't quite
catch the name.

208
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,386
Sherlock Holmes.

209
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,584
Oh.

210
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,820
Sherlock Holmes,

211
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,658
the famous detective.

212
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,893
One wonders what he could
be doing in Inverness.

213
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,332
Have you forgotten
Alastair

214
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,800
that two of our members

215
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,837
have already met
with violent deaths?

216
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,305
Yes, yes, yes
of course yes.

217
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,706
Cosgrave, must you
pace up and down

218
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,744
like a monkey in
a ruddy cage?

219
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,303
I fail to see how what
I do can concern you.

220
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,817
Simpson, Cosgrave,

221
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,614
cannot we behave
like Good Comrades.

222
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,656
Doesn't anything ever get
on your nerves Alastair?

223
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,658
Oh dear me, no.

224
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,194
I have no nerves.

225
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,823
Now tell me MacGregor,

226
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,368
the present head
of the house

227
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:38,903
is Mr. Bruce
Alastair is it not?

228
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,030
Aye.

229
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,702
Grandson of
Donald Alastair.

230
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:47,302
He was the lullish one.

231
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,579
Gunned Driercliff House
in a smugglers day.

232
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,280
Got himself blown
to bits by a gun.

233
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,049
Gracious me.

234
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:01,617
And Angus Alastair
was his son.

235
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,528
He was eaten by cannibals
in the South Seas.

236
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,463
Very unfortunate
family, hey Holmes?

237
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,730
They found Angus' bones.

238
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,771
Sent them back
to Driercliff

239
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,863
where no man ever goes

240
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,999
whole to his grave.

241
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,941
The place is haunted.

242
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,308
Haunted?

243
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,109
You mean ghosts?

244
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,174
Only a fool
believes in ghosts.

245
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,720
Spirits never
haunted Driercliff.

246
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,052
Five minutes to
closing time gentlemen.

247
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,489
Only the memory of evil.

248
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,763
You're wanted at
Driercliff House Sergeant.

249
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,302
What is it woman?

250
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,203
Murder.

251
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,707
Alastair himself is it?

252
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,140
I don't know.

253
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,508
Doctor Merrivale
didn't say.

254
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,013
Mr. Holmes would you
care to come along?

255
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,515
Yes I would, thank you.

256
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,845
Watson.

257
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,420
You mark my words,

258
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,821
Alastair has met
the brutal death

259
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,086
of these fathers.

260
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,565
Awe, good
evening Sergeant.

261
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:24,836
Oh Mr. Alastair,

262
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,002
this is Mr.
Sherlock Holmes

263
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,102
and Doctor Watson.

264
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,407
I took the liberty of...

265
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,142
Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson.

266
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,444
How do you do sir?

267
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,075
Oh this excellent,
most excellent.

268
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,414
Please come in gentlemen.

269
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,012
Please come in.

270
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,989
And welcome to
Driercliff House.

271
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,753
Now where is the corpse?

272
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,919
Follow me.

273
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,223
It's by the furnace.

274
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,422
The furnace?

275
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,159
Yes poor Davis

276
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,224
he was burnt to a crisp.

277
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,529
Burnt to a crisp.

278
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,865
I say Holmes

279
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,632
this murder seems a
bit of a fiend hey?

280
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,832
At least he's consistent.

281
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,204
Consistent?

282
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,606
Yes the deaths all follow

283
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,938
the legend of Driercliff.

284
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,103
Well as MacGregor puts it

285
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,703
no man ever goes
whole to his grave.

286
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,214
Now you will come in here
gentlemen, won't you?

287
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,408
Oh thank you.

288
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,575
That's right.

289
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,278
That's right.

290
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,513
Yes.

291
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,680
Yes.

292
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,986
These gentlemen have
come about the body.

293
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,787
Why didn't you take
them to the cellar?

294
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,760
Oh no, Doctor Merrivale,

295
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,194
you discovered it,

296
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,926
after all it's your body.

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,763
That's right.

298
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,393
I say,

299
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,960
you're
Sherlock Holmes
aren't you?

300
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,437
I am

301
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,939
and this is my friend and
colleague, Doctor Watson.

302
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:29,872
How do you do?

303
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,000
How do you do sir?

304
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,475
Yes I thought I
recognized you.

305
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,137
You know I followed
your exploits for years.

306
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,113
The detection of crime
is one of my hobbies.

307
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,740
This is a surprise
and a pleasure.

308
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,079
A pleasure I hope

309
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,482
but hardly a surprise.

310
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,282
You saw me at the
inn this afternoon.

311
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,685
Touché'.

312
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,621
This is Allen Cosgrave

313
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:46,885
and Captain Simpson.

314
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,153
How do you do?

315
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,751
This stressing
business, Mr. Homes,

316
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,194
we were all fond
of Guy Davis.

317
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,525
Davis?

318
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,293
Oh the fellow
in the furnace.

319
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,628
But if he was
burnt to a crisp

320
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,328
how'd you know
that it was Davis?

321
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,734
Well he's the
only one missing.

322
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,034
Besides we identified
him by his cuff links.

323
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,801
Why don't you see
for yourselves?

324
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,809
Come along gentlemen.

325
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:07,838
Thank you.

326
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,912
May I ask Doctor Merrivale

327
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,388
whether Mr. Davis
also received

328
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,118
the warning of the
orange pips after dinner.

329
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,955
Oh so you know
about the others?

330
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,619
You seem to be
very well informed

331
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,061
about our affairs,
Mr. Holmes.

332
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,620
As a matter of fact

333
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,064
Davis didn't have
dinner with us tonight.

334
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,794
Had he indicated his
intended absence?

335
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,598
No, no he hadn't.

336
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,332
Mrs. Monteith was
quite put out about it.

337
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,034
Pardon me, will
you gentlemen?

338
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,110
Doctor Watson,

339
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,841
what's Mr. Holmes up to?

340
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,280
I haven't the foggiest.

341
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,647
Go on.

342
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,742
You'll find out,
my dear sir,

343
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,719
in good time.

344
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,927
Isn't there something

345
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,587
you wish to tell
me Mrs. Monteith?

346
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,857
Me sir?

347
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,262
Yes.

348
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:01,731
Please give it to me.

349
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,995
The envelope addressed
to Mr. Guy Davis.

350
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,339
Thank you.

351
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,138
Five pips this time.

352
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,808
How did you know
that she had them?

353
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,613
It's obvious
my dear Watson,

354
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,449
since Mr. Davis
was not at dinner,

355
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,954
Mrs. Monteith
had no opportunity

356
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,354
to deliver the envelope.

357
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,789
Yes of course,
quite obvious.

358
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,156
Where'd you find it?

359
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,422
It was pushed under
the door like the others.

360
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,794
Thank you Mrs. Monteith,
that will be all.

361
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,696
Where are they coming
from, Mr. Holmes?

362
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,895
Who's sending
these things to us?

363
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,870
Is there anyone who might
have a grudge against you?

364
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,066
Have orange pips
any significance

365
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,438
for any of you?

366
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,635
Well?

367
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,871
I seem to remember
reading somewhere

368
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,380
that among some
obscure tribe of savages

369
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,279
orange pips
were looked upon...

370
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,841
as a symbol of death.

371
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,045
Oh really?

372
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,052
Sergeant?

373
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,985
Aye sir.

374
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,648
I think you'd better
telephone Scotland Yard.

375
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,385
We've never
had a telephone

376
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,154
at Driercliff House no.

377
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,592
They're so noisy.

378
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,061
I can make the call
from the village sir.

379
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,324
All right.

380
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,695
It's not often we
have the opportunity

381
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:08,994
at meeting such
charming people.

382
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,228
You go ahead
I'll follow you.

383
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,394
I'm afraid, Mr. Holmes,

384
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,528
if you don't go
with the sergeant

385
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,764
there's no way
to get back

386
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,897
to the village tonight.

387
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,032
Oh but Mr. Holmes,

388
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,473
there's no need for you
to stay at the inn.

389
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,737
It's such a dreary place.

390
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,903
We've plenty
of room here

391
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,241
and it's much
more cheerful.

392
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,941
I thought we came
here for privacy.

393
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,779
We wouldn't dream
of putting you out.

394
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,512
Oh but I thought
it would be

395
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,814
so nice to have such,

396
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,821
such exciting people
as our guests.

397
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,449
Yes your right.

398
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,618
I'm sure Mr. Holmes'
business in the village

399
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,491
is much more
important, Alastair.

400
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,190
Please Mr.
Holmes we insist.

401
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,357
I think Alastair's idea
is an excellent one,

402
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,162
don't you gentlemen?

403
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:44,725
You speak for
yourself, Cosgrave.

404
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,236
Come, come, come,

405
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,034
We are all friends.

406
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,507
Aren't we,

407
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,771
or are we?

408
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,904
Guy Davis was
a friend too.

409
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,675
So were King and Raeburn.

410
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,341
You've got to
stay Mr. Holmes.

411
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,714
You and Doctor Watson,

412
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,252
we can put you up.

413
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,288
Any objections
Doctor Merrivale?

414
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,016
This is a tempest
in a teapot Mr. Holmes

415
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,421
but you're
welcome of course.

416
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,983
Now if you'll all excuse
me I'm rather tired.

417
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,095
Good night.

418
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,992
What do you say Simpson?

419
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,730
Glad to have you
gentlemen of course.

420
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,999
Then you will
stay both of you?

421
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,370
Thank you Mr. Alastair

422
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,874
we should be very glad to.

423
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,273
Sergeant will you
have our things

424
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,504
sent up from the inn?

425
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,567
Right away sir.

426
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,544
This is excellent.

427
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,275
I'll tell Mrs. Monteith
to get your rooms ready.

428
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,475
Mr. Holmes,

429
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,847
I must say I
feel a lot safer

430
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,078
now that you
and Doctor Watson

431
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,313
are in the house.

432
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,752
Oh a delight to be of
any use, Mr. Cosgrave.

433
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,916
And well if you would
care to keep me informed

434
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,391
if you should
discover anything

435
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,394
I would be only too
glad to help you.

436
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,793
I'd do anything

437
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,330
to get to the bottom
of this awful mystery.

438
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,865
I'll bear that in
mind Mr. Cosgrave.

439
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,195
Thank you.

440
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,200
Good night.

441
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,133
Good night.

442
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,761
Good night.

443
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,839
Well what do you
make of it Watson?

444
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,611
Well my theory is
its Doctor Merrivale.

445
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,015
Did you take a
look at his eyes?

446
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,576
Rather frightening huh?

447
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,622
Yes but that might
be accounted for

448
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,247
by advanced myopia,

449
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,019
complicated with
a stigmatism.

450
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,720
Well who do you
think it is?

451
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,227
At the moment

452
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,854
I suspect no one

453
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,660
and everyone.

454
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:21,960
So it's your theory

455
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,126
that Doctor Merrivale
is the murderer?

456
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,191
Yes, yes Merrivale.

457
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,258
Hum.

458
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,669
What about...

459
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,536
what about
Captain Simpson?

460
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,041
Simpson?

461
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,702
I see what you mean?

462
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,109
Do you?

463
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,441
Yes.

464
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,482
There's a surly looking
chap if I ever saw one.

465
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,016
He didn't much relish

466
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,608
our being asked to
stay here either.

467
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,711
Right you are Watson.

468
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,415
Do you suspect
anyone else?

469
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,459
Well of course,
there's old Alastair.

470
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,153
And what might cause
you to suspect Alastair?

471
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,287
He's too good to be true.

472
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,579
What are you looking
for now Holmes?

473
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,083
I wish I knew Watson.

474
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,517
Someone's got a morbid
taste in literature.

475
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,285
Or a thirst for knowledge.

476
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,986
Now Holmes there's
one of them

477
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,425
that's got nothing
to do with it?

478
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,723
Who?

479
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,024
Cosgrave.

480
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,292
Why Cosgrave?

481
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,492
Well he's definitely
got the wind up.

482
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,932
Fairly begged us
to stay just now.

483
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:34,701
Yes I'd vouch for
Cosgrave all right.

484
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,400
Mrs. Monteith will
be down directly

485
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,874
to show you to your rooms.

486
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,467
I just popped in
to say good night.

487
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,603
Oh thank you.

488
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,941
I trust you'll sleep well.

489
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,504
Oh by the way
Mr. Alastair,

490
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,049
I wonder if you
could tell us

491
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,084
which one of you suggested

492
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,618
changing your
insurance policies

493
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,085
making the other
members of your club

494
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,348
the beneficiaries?

495
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,446
Awe let me see now.

496
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,888
Oh yes of course,

497
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,050
it was dear old Allen.

498
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,150
Allen?

499
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,353
Allen Cosgrave.

500
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,417
Good night.

501
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,758
Good night.

502
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,922
Cosgrave!

503
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,556
I suspected him
from the start.

504
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,328
Yes you did didn't you?

505
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,633
How about a pint
before we go to sleep?

506
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,502
Sleep?

507
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,439
I won't be able
to close my eyes

508
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,534
in this sinister house.

509
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,811
Your rooms are
ready gentlemen.

510
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,724
Where's our good
friend Doctor Watson?

511
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,160
Oh he was rather
tired last night,

512
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,595
he's still sleeping.

513
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,394
Yes, our beds are
very comfortable here.

514
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,765
Why don't you stop
that ruddy pacing?

515
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,599
Your bodyguard's here now.

516
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,129
Simpson, you mustn't
tease Cosgrave.

517
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,176
Remember how
sensitive he is.

518
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,235
You should
ignore things,

519
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,212
like Alastair.

520
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,010
Thank you.

521
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,184
Oh, Singapore?

522
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,348
Huh?

523
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,015
Oh the Cobra.

524
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,424
No,

525
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,291
you'll never
know that one

526
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,797
but this one.

527
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,833
Oh yes, yes very good

528
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,299
and definitely Singapore.

529
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,666
Right you are Mr. Holmes.

530
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,204
You know you're
tattoos all right.

531
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,968
I'm interested
in many things.

532
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,475
Good morning gentlemen.

533
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,908
I'm sorry I'm late

534
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,172
I didn't sleep very well.

535
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,543
You didn't
sleep very well?

536
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,546
You snored like a pig.

537
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,673
Rubbish!

538
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,808
Got a match Doctor Watson?

539
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,146
Yes.

540
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,345
It's a very good idea.

541
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,717
I think I'll join you.

542
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,483
Nothing like the first
pipe of the morning.

543
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,888
Can, can I try
of some of yours?

544
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,021
Sorry about that,

545
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,392
I think I'll stay clear.

546
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,431
What is that seaweed?

547
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,966
Havana isn't it?

548
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,968
Flavored with Jamaica Rum.

549
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,628
I don't imagine your
very much troubled

550
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,467
with tobacco borrowers
hey Simpson?

551
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,598
Nobody else in the place
touches the filthy stuff.

552
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,200
I don't blame them.

553
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,269
Good heavens!

554
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,837
One moment please.

555
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,042
What is it?

556
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,449
Just a needle.

557
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,785
Who put that in my chair?

558
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,324
Hum.

559
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,917
This is no
ordinary needle.

560
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,428
The stain on my
handkerchief

561
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,691
suggest a certain
sinister possibility.

562
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,164
Give me that
beaker will you?

563
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,427
Yes of course.

564
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,695
We shall see.

565
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,895
Thank you.

566
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,801
As I thought,

567
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,674
insoluble in alcohol.

568
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,213
Whatever is it?

569
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,839
Well judging by the
stain on my handkerchief

570
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,510
and the milky
precipitation in alcohol

571
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,075
I should say it
was a derivative

572
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,711
of the tropizine family.

573
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,983
Paratropizine possibly?

574
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,254
That's right
Doctor Merrivale,
a deadly poison.

575
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,261
Close shaved
Captain Simpson.

576
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,557
One drop in the
bloodstream

577
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,463
brings agonizing
almost instant death.

578
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,072
It's our custom
at this hour

579
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,268
to honor our
departed friends.

580
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,038
I hope you gentlemen
will pardon us?

581
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,739
We quite understand
Doctor Merrivale,

582
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:02,905
please proceed.

583
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,471
Thank you.

584
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,243
Good Comrades,

585
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,753
our dear friend Guy Davis

586
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,311
has gone to his reward.

587
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,051
Let those of us who remain

588
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,854
drink to our dead

589
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,985
and to that
bright tomorrow

590
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,359
when we shall join them

591
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,888
in a better,
happier world.

592
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,298
Wait a minute,

593
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,733
there's something
wrong here.

594
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,703
If you please
Captain Simpson.

595
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,573
The odor of
bitter almonds.

596
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,377
Bitter almonds, acid huh?

597
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,849
Acid?

598
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,545
there must be
some mistake.

599
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,019
Mistake hey?

600
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,454
Lucky I didn't make it
by drinking that stuff.

601
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,253
Well what have
you got to say?

602
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,657
Whichever one of you
it was tried to kill me

603
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,286
had better look out.

604
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,264
I'm a dangerous
man to fool with.

605
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,931
Hadn't we better
adjourned?

606
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,438
I mean to say that...

607
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,837
We've not yet finished

608
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,205
the toast to our dead.

609
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,607
But you think
it's quite safe?

610
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,042
Don't be absurd Alastair.

611
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,409
Take my glass.

612
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,710
I assure you it
hasn't been poisoned.

613
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,409
Thank you.

614
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,284
Thank you
Doctor Merrivale.

615
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,380
To our departed Comrades.

616
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:47,776
For me?

617
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,684
Aye Mr. Cosgrave,

618
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,314
it says so on
the envelope.

619
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,399
It's come.

620
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,497
Did you find this envelope

621
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,370
as you did the others?

622
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,374
Aye.

623
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,535
When?

624
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,771
It was pushed
under the door

625
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,142
when everyone was
in here at dinner.

626
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,441
Thank you.

627
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,777
Well there's one thing
we can be sure of,

628
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,282
none of us could
have brought it.

629
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,911
How do we know that she's
not responsible for them?

630
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,545
Mrs. Monteith?

631
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,715
It's absurd Cosgrave,
utterly absurd.

632
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,519
She has been with my
family all of her life.

633
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,423
A dubious a
recommendation

634
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,018
if you ask me.

635
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,223
Mr. Holmes when
do you expect

636
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:34,595
the man from
Scotland Yard?

637
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,826
Inspector Lestrade?

638
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,266
He should be here
early in the morning.

639
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,962
Unless he got on
the wrong train.

640
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,629
I trust your
right Mr. Holmes.

641
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,764
I trust your right.

642
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,775
Oh dear, he's
terribly upset.

643
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:48,301
Doctor Merrivale can't
you do something for him?

644
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,711
I can stay with him
in his room tonight.

645
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,271
Why that's an
excellent idea

646
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,647
and I shall just be
across the hall from him.

647
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,083
I think that's the
wisest possible cause

648
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,450
with you gentlemen
protecting each other

649
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:57,681
what harm can fall you?

650
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,155
Well then we must
hope for the best.

651
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,282
Come Merrivale.

652
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,120
Good night gentlemen.

653
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,090
Good night.

654
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,422
Good night.

655
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,926
I say Holmes, have you
gone out of your mind?

656
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,490
Cosgrave just got
the orange pips

657
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,831
and your letting Merrivale

658
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,029
sleep in the same
room with him.

659
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,093
He'll be all right.

660
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,139
All right?

661
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,400
But what's
preventing Merrivale

662
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,805
from killing him
in his sleep?

663
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,537
I hardly think he'll
stick his own neck

664
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,306
squarely in the noose.

665
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,745
Well, I see what you mean.

666
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,682
Well the field's
narrowing down, Holmes.

667
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,049
Captain Simpson
certainly cleared.

668
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,382
How?

669
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,854
Yes he's definitely
been eliminated.

670
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,050
The killer had two
tries at him today.

671
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,956
Nonsense my dear Watson.

672
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,756
No one's tried to murder
captain Simpson's.

673
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,763
Well how about the poison
needle we both saw?

674
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,129
Captain Simpson spotted
it, if you'll recall,

675
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,462
from about where you are.

676
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,162
Oh what's so
extraordinary about that?

677
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,931
Can you see the
needle there now?

678
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:47,972
No.

679
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,303
Well there is one.

680
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,364
Gracious.

681
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,467
How'd it get there?

682
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,875
I placed it there myself

683
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,708
just before we
went into supper.

684
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,077
You couldn't see it yet

685
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,706
you have
exceptional eyesight.

686
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,045
Well you'd have to
have telescopic eyes

687
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,346
to see it from over there.

688
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,545
Exactly.

689
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,350
You mean that Simpson...

690
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,822
well how about the
acid in his drink?

691
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:08,756
There wasn't any
acid in his drink.

692
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,192
Well it
definitely smelled

693
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,353
like bitter almonds.

694
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,657
It should.

695
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,495
That's exactly what it
was, bitter almonds.

696
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,196
How do you know?

697
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,931
Cause I put it in
his drink myself.

698
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,166
You did?

699
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,070
Great Scott why?

700
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,472
To observe his reaction.

701
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,975
It was quite different
from that of the morning.

702
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,238
The first was acting,

703
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,802
the second genuine terror.

704
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,279
Hence, I knew that
he undoubtedly

705
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:31,713
planted the
needle himself.

706
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,148
Well why should he?

707
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,549
Well there are several
possible explanations,

708
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:35,984
the most obvious,
of course,

709
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,351
to advert suspicion.

710
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,357
And you think Simpson's
behind all this?

711
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,858
I don't know Watson.

712
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,258
This is a most
unique case.

713
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,523
Instead of too few

714
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,757
we have too many clues

715
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,298
and too many suspects.

716
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,663
The main pattern
on the puzzle

717
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,429
seems to be forming

718
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,061
but the pieces
don't fit in.

719
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,867
Well it seems
perfectly clear to me.

720
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,133
One of these men

721
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,640
is picking off the
others one by one

722
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,074
to get all their insurance
money for himself.

723
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:01,203
Why it's obvious.

724
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,746
How do you account
the orange pips?

725
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,304
Well this man
has an accomplice

726
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,474
who brings them.

727
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,778
What for?

728
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,648
To warn his victim he's
going to be murdered?

729
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,086
No Watson, it won't
do, it won't do at all.

730
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,453
I don't like the
look of it Holmes,

731
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,957
muddy waters huh?

732
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,549
Too muddy

733
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,060
as if someone
were constantly

734
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,356
stirring them up.

735
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,829
Why should they
stir them up?

736
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,229
Confuse me.

737
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,493
There's intelligence

738
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,000
behind this
business Watson.

739
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,129
Cold, calculating,

740
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,070
ruthless intelligence.

741
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,370
Must you smoke
that filthy stuff?

742
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,070
Smells like an old sock.

743
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,543
Strong tobacco
keeps one awake.

744
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,011
You better have
a pipe full.

745
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,605
We have a long vigil
ahead of us tonight.

746
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,808
No thank you.

747
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,248
I don't need any
of that stinkweed

748
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,980
to keep me awake
in this chamber of...

749
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,619
This chamber of horrors.

750
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,592
He's still asleep
Mr. Holmes.

751
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,032
Thanks for your
watchfulness.

752
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,977
Holmes!

753
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,976
Holmes! Holmes!

754
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,555
Holmes! Holmes! Holmes!

755
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:53,917
Watson!

756
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,459
Watson are you all right?

757
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:58,962
I think so.

758
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,498
It was a close call.

759
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,828
What happened?

760
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,926
I didn't see a
thing I was asleep.

761
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,301
Someone came at me
from, from behind.

762
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,205
If you'll come this
way Inspector Lestrade.

763
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,766
Thank you very
much my good woman.

764
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,214
Well, well Mr. Holmes.

765
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,944
Doctor Watson.

766
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,384
How are you Lestrade?

767
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,943
Here, here, what's
going on here?

768
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,388
Someone just tried to
kill Doctor Watson.

769
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,890
Blimey who?

770
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,153
When we find that
out, Lestrade,

771
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,524
we can all go home.

772
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:31,619
All right, Mr. Holmes,

773
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,129
Scotland Yard will
take charge of this.

774
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,631
Have a look around the
grounds briefly will ya?

775
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,929
Yes Inspector.

776
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,265
Mr. Holmes I'm afraid
something's happened

777
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,361
to Cosgrave and Merrivale.

778
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,405
What?

779
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:42,530
The door to their
rooms are locked.

780
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,665
I can't get any answer.

781
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:44,799
What is going on here?

782
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,468
Well I do hope
they're all right.

783
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,708
Got your skeleton
key, Lestrade?

784
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,114
Yes I have.

785
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,481
One minute.

786
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,541
Here we are.

787
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,088
Watson!

788
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,819
Lestrade, give me a hand.

789
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:02,985
Yes Mr. Holmes.

790
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,119
Get him on the bed.

791
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,253
Yes.

792
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,456
What a dreadful
thing to happen.

793
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,294
Oh poor Merrivale.

794
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,890
Is he badly hurt?

795
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,799
Yes he's had a nasty
crack on the head.

796
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,734
What?

797
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,032
Take it easy Doctor.

798
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,367
Don't try to talk.

799
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,101
Mrs. Monteith get
him some cotton wool

800
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,267
and some hot water

801
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,605
as quickly as you can.

802
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,871
Tell me what happened?

803
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,435
He's in no state to be
questioned now Lestrade.

804
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,276
Who do you suspect
Mr. Holmes?

805
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,976
I don't know Lestrade

806
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,540
but it's connected

807
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,950
with the attack
on Doctor Watson.

808
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,385
It was obviously intended
to draw me downstairs.

809
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,752
Where's Cosgrave?

810
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,290
Here I'm taking over here.

811
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,757
It looks to me
that this Cosgrave,

812
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,260
or whoever he is,
is are murderer.

813
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,296
Well he didn't murder
Doctor Merrivale.

814
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,490
He's still alive.

815
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,725
Yes.

816
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,096
Yes he is isn't he?

817
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,259
Well just the same

818
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,495
I'd like to ask
this Cosgrave

819
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,628
a few questions.

820
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,137
I don't think you're going
to find Mr. Cosgrave,

821
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,673
at least not alive.

822
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,174
What's going on here?

823
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,336
I'm afraid Holmes
is right Inspector.

824
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,811
Poor Cosgrave,

825
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,973
by now he's probably
murdered like the others.

826
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,277
Murdered?

827
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,408
Oh dear.

828
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,079
What's your interest about
that rope, Mr. Holmes?

829
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,384
I was looking at
this knot Lestrade

830
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,753
it's a Bowline,

831
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,189
much favored by
sea faring men.

832
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,726
Oh sailor hey?

833
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:10,658
Simpson.

834
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:11,854
Simpson?

835
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,261
Captain Simpson.

836
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,958
But, but now, now,
now it couldn't be.

837
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,330
How do you know
it couldn't be?

838
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,869
Mr. Alastair where
is Captain Simpson?

839
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,462
He's not in his
room either.

840
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,166
I looked when I
tried to arouse

841
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,503
Cosgrave and Merrivale.

842
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,509
Has anybody seen this
Simpson this morning?

843
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,239
I saw him walking across
the garden, Inspector,

844
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,509
about fifteen minutes ago.

845
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,915
Now we're getting
somewhere.

846
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,085
Which is the way down?

847
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,716
How did I get up here?

848
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,090
Suffering cats what
is going on here?

849
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,423
Do you have any
explosives on the place?

850
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:45,826
Yes we have some dynamite

851
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,091
stored in the shed

852
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,462
behind the stone room.

853
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,795
What do you need
dynamite for?

854
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,425
Just to blow up some
cumbersome rocks.

855
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,567
Pretty badly
mangled Holmes?

856
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,972
Can't tell who it is.

857
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,976
It's Cosgrave all right.

858
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,104
Poor Allen.

859
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,775
Cosgrave's I presume?

860
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,909
Certainly looks like
the ring he wore.

861
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,420
Yes, yes for that
I am positive.

862
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,682
Look here.

863
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,087
What was he doing
with dynamite

864
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,385
at this time in
the morning?

865
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,154
That we shall never know.

866
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,195
Oh dear and it
was all my fault.

867
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,923
I never should have
let them keep it here.

868
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,397
Don't blame yourself
Mr. Alastair,

869
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,798
his body was
carried here, look.

870
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,337
Observe those
heavy footprints.

871
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,200
Yes I see the whole thing.

872
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,572
Cosgrave was
knocked unconscious,

873
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:33,940
Thrown into the shed

874
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,274
and deliberately blown up.

875
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,472
Yes.

876
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,345
This chap was carrying a
heavy burden all right.

877
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:44,481
Hello, who are you?

878
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,455
My name is Simpson,

879
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,889
Captain Simpson.

880
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,291
I'm Inspector Lestrade
from Scotland Yard.

881
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,919
What do you know
about this murder?

882
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,486
Well I was walking
on the East terrace

883
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:54,861
when I saw Cosgrave

884
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,093
enter the shed where
the dynamite's stored.

885
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,726
Do you mind
comparing your shoe

886
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,703
with one of these prints?

887
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,433
Are you accusing
me, Inspector?

888
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,769
I'll tell you in a minute.

889
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,308
Put your foot in
one of these prints.

890
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,673
Nonsense, Lestrade.

891
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,507
If only to look at the
shoes of everyone present

892
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,910
to know that
these footprints

893
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,346
are much too big
to have been made

894
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,781
by anybody here.

895
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,613
With the possible
exception of you Lestrade.

896
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,016
Look here Doctor Watson,
that ain't funny.

897
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,349
Captain Simpson,

898
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,719
how did you happen to be

899
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,121
walking on the terrace

900
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,385
at the time of explosion?

901
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,483
I couldn't sleep

902
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,686
and I was taking a
stroll before breakfast.

903
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,921
I see.

904
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,020
What do you know about
this knot Captain?

905
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,291
It's a bowline of course.

906
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:28,627
I don't suppose you
ever seen it before.

907
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,791
What the devil are
you driving at?

908
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,960
This knot is evidence
that will hang a murderer,

909
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,469
and he might not be
standing so far away

910
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,766
from the arm of the law

911
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,238
at this very moment.

912
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,604
Oh come now, Lestrade.

913
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,370
This knot proves
absolutely nothing.

914
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,275
Practically
anybody can tie one.

915
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,812
Can you?

916
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,247
Yes I think I
can, Lestrade.

917
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,716
There you are.

918
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,810
Well quite a
knotty problem huh?

919
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,378
With your
permission gentlemen,

920
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,448
Captain Simpson and I

921
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,049
will go and
make arrangements

922
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,856
for the funeral
of our friend.

923
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,124
Come Simpson.

924
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,529
I wonder which one

925
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,157
of three remaining
Good Comrades

926
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:06,761
will be the next to
receive the orange pips.

927
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,466
Orange pips?

928
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,132
Will someone
please tell me

929
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,301
what's going on here?

930
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,710
Where is that confounded
woman with the brandy?

931
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,614
Mrs. Monteith?

932
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,451
Well there you are,

933
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:28,390
it's about time too.

934
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,427
Let's get on with
the ceremony.

935
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,631
What are you going to
do about this Inspector?

936
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,330
What are you going to do?

937
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,100
Orange pips hey?

938
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,664
The police will
handle this.

939
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:18,970
We'll protect you.

940
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,908
Holmes tried to protect
Cosgrave, he's dead.

941
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,502
Scotland Yard's
in charge now

942
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,911
just you come
along with me.

943
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,347
Just a moment Simpson.

944
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,510
We've not yet drunk our
usual toast to the dead.

945
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,917
To the dickens
with the dead.

946
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,784
From now on I'm
thinking of myself.

947
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,585
Just you come along
with me Captain.

948
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,954
Say Holmes do you think?

949
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,495
Shh.

950
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,108
Oh it's you Inspector.

951
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,734
My nerves are all on edge.

952
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,642
Just wanted to make sure
you were all set Captain.

953
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,442
You're sure I'm safe here?

954
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,073
Safe as a bank of England.

955
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,947
You're protected
from every angle.

956
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,849
On the terrace is
Sergeant Bleeker,

957
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,945
out of sight but on
the job every second.

958
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,353
While in the shrubbery

959
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,789
is the local
sergeant of police

960
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,189
ready to pounce

961
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,160
if the bugger should
come that way.

962
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:11,524
That's fine Inspector.

963
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,824
While I myself

964
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,296
guard the lower hall,

965
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,799
hoping and praying the
killer should come my way.

966
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,959
Come on.

967
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:21,004
Sounds very thorough but
I don't like it very well.

968
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,937
Oh go on tuck
yourself in and relax.

969
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,669
Scotland Yard will
look after the rest.

970
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,801
Good night.

971
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,572
Good night Inspector.

972
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,662
All right put
up your hands.

973
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:58,470
Oh well Mr. Holmes.

974
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,907
Ready for your
vigil Lestrade?

975
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,502
What do you know
about my vigil?

976
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,740
My dear fellow

977
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:04,974
you hold a very
secret conference

978
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,243
with Captain Simpson

979
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,409
and then packed
him off to bed.

980
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,850
It follows like the day

981
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,943
you must be
baiting a trap.

982
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,147
Where'd you find
those boots?

983
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,314
In the cupboard.

984
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,687
I've been looking
for them all day.

985
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:14,918
Oddly enough they weren't
there an hour ago.

986
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,425
Weren't they?

987
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,791
Those shoes are big enough

988
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:18,851
for those footprints
we saw this morning.

989
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,123
Right you are Inspector

990
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,459
and observe the clay.

991
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,329
A very particular
variety of clay.

992
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,368
Ready Holmes?

993
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:25,800
Yes Watson.

994
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,996
Like to join us

995
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,163
in a little
stroll on the beach?

996
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,536
Awe no thank you.

997
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,801
You and Doctor Watson

998
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,842
go play in the sand

999
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,035
as much as you like

1000
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,099
but I'm going to
stay right here

1001
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,110
to catch the murderer.

1002
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,203
Good luck.

1003
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,214
Well if you get nervous
you know where we are.

1004
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,021
Look Watson footprints!

1005
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,687
And they're
fairly fresh too.

1006
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,060
Very fresh.

1007
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,155
Big foot all right.

1008
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,324
Got your revolver?

1009
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,367
Yes.

1010
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,367
We haven't much
time to lose,

1011
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,835
the tide's coming in fast.

1012
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,464
See it goes along here.

1013
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,768
Wait a minute.

1014
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,605
Now he stops to
light his pipe.

1015
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,043
Observe the spilled
tobacco and burnt match,

1016
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,580
now he goes on again.

1017
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:16,578
Wait a minute here we are.

1018
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,780
Hello.

1019
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,049
What is it Holmes?

1020
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,681
Another set of footprints.

1021
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,385
Bigfoots been
joined by somebody.

1022
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,655
This one's a smaller man.

1023
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,321
Now they go
along together,

1024
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,558
side by side.

1025
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:29,963
Now but slowly
I should say

1026
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,195
judging by the spacing
of the footprints.

1027
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,794
Now little foot
goes up the cliff

1028
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:39,070
and big foot
goes on alone.

1029
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,075
Hello.

1030
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,873
Something funny there.

1031
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:45,905
Footprints disappear
all together.

1032
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,508
Look out Watson!

1033
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,384
Great scott Holmes
that was meant for us.

1034
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,787
Precisely.

1035
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:58,227
Well there's nothing
more to be done here.

1036
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,819
I have a strong feeling

1037
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,888
we are needed back at
the Driercliff House.

1038
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,465
With the
possible exception

1039
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:16,172
of your own Lestrade.

1040
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,511
Blimey they're bigger.

1041
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,640
Here!

1042
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,684
Here!

1043
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,811
Who's fooling around
with this lock?

1044
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,219
Sergeant Bleeker!

1045
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,813
Bleeker!

1046
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,327
Sergeant Bleeker!

1047
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,329
Sergeant Bleeker!

1048
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,894
...well Mr. Holmes.

1049
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,061
Where's Simpson?

1050
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:40,831
He's in the...

1051
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,537
he's gone.

1052
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,772
I left him here on
this here couch.

1053
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:03,857
What happened?

1054
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,292
Someone bashed my head in.

1055
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,492
Did you see his face?

1056
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,694
Who?

1057
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,134
The murderer you
blithering idiot,

1058
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,001
the murderer and his
victim, Captain Simpson.

1059
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,097
All I saw was stars.

1060
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,368
It's your
theory, Lestrade,

1061
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,773
that someone broke
through this window

1062
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,277
and abducted
Captain Simpson?

1063
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,778
It's no theory,
it's obvious.

1064
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,973
Then how do you
account for the fact

1065
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,345
that there's no sign
of broken glass

1066
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,974
on this side
of the window?

1067
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,678
Blimey, no there isn't.

1068
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,720
Therefore, the window was
broken from the inside.

1069
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,948
Stick by us old man,

1070
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,252
we'll make a detective
out of you yet.

1071
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,263
I say what happened?

1072
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,095
Captain Simpson seems
to of disappeared.

1073
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,464
Disappeared my foot.

1074
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,695
He's run away.

1075
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,100
He really was
frightened you know?

1076
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,638
That's just what he
wanted us to think.

1077
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:50,037
No harm would have
come to him here

1078
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,438
if he'd stayed
and he knew it.

1079
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,204
I was right in the
first instance,

1080
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,211
he's our blasted
murder himself.

1081
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,246
Dear me,

1082
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,281
Captain Simpson
a murderer?

1083
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,509
Don't you worry
Mr. Alastair,

1084
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,880
we'll soon have
him in jail

1085
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,316
before he can
kill anyone else.

1086
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,014
Aye.

1087
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,683
You'll find him
like the others,

1088
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,191
a corpse.

1089
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,092
Don't you
worry gentlemen

1090
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,596
it's only just a
question of time

1091
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,132
before we catch
Captain Simpson.

1092
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,462
He couldn't have got far.

1093
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,435
My men will soon
apprehend him.

1094
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,993
You know this
rather reminds me

1095
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,402
of a very similar account

1096
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,940
when I brought
about the undoing

1097
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,033
of the notorious
Professor Moriarty.

1098
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,475
You brought it about?

1099
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,944
If it hadn't been
for Mr. Holmes.

1100
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,207
Oh well of course
with the assistance

1101
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,942
of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

1102
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,678
We found him Inspector.

1103
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,913
There you are what
did I tell you?

1104
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:37,954
Where is he?

1105
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:38,989
At the beach sir.

1106
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:39,852
Dead?

1107
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,221
Oh yes sir, quite.

1108
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,452
Dead?

1109
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:43,993
How did you know he
was dead Mr. Holmes?

1110
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,221
Elementary my
dear, Lestrade.

1111
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,263
The pieces of the puzzle

1112
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,524
are beginning to
fall into place.

1113
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,895
In what way was
the body mutilated?

1114
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:52,197
No arms, no legs
and no head sir.

1115
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,601
Observe the occurrence
of the pattern Watson?

1116
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:55,866
I see.

1117
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,271
No man goes whole
to his grave huh?

1118
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,501
Exactly.

1119
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,770
Oh dear.

1120
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,471
Poor Simpson.

1121
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,010
Well, if it was nothing
but a blooming torso

1122
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,608
how did you know you
got the right man?

1123
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:09,983
Quite simple Lestrade.

1124
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,544
Sergeant Bleeker
identified the body

1125
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,182
by the full rig ship
tattooed on the chest.

1126
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,190
That's right Mr. Holmes.

1127
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,954
Tattooed?

1128
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,221
Where did you
know that he had

1129
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,126
a blinking boat
on his epidermis?

1130
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,529
Oh uh, I mentioned it
to Sergeant Bleeker

1131
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,295
when he asked me to
describe a fugitive.

1132
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,699
That is we thought
at the time

1133
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,929
he was a fugitive.

1134
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,028
Oh.

1135
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,197
All right Bleeker

1136
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,433
you better be getting
back to the beach.

1137
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,701
Yes sir.

1138
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,370
One thing more Sergeant,

1139
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,470
you will say

1140
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,673
that the body had no arms,

1141
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,682
no head and no legs,

1142
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,014
was it a messy job?

1143
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,713
Oh no sir, very
neat I should say,

1144
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,084
clean as a whistle.

1145
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,521
Just as if it
was done by a...

1146
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,321
Of a skilled hands
of a surgeon?

1147
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,328
Yes.

1148
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,693
Yes.

1149
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,985
For Inspector Lestrade
of Scotland Yard.

1150
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,224
What?

1151
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,730
But...

1152
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,959
Excuse me Inspector.

1153
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,433
Please Watson.

1154
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,299
Thank you.

1155
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,438
So sorry old fellow.

1156
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,073
No orange pips.

1157
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,244
Here just a minute

1158
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,153
that might be
police business.

1159
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,918
Inspector Lestrade,

1160
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,254
I must see you at once

1161
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,793
about the
Driercliff mystery.

1162
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,419
Please come to my
shop in the village

1163
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:00,929
as soon as possible.

1164
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,056
Alex MacGregor.

1165
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,724
MacGregor, the
tobacconist.

1166
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:04,893
Where is his shop?

1167
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,094
Next to the inn.

1168
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,467
Well I better be off.

1169
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,869
Mind if I come
along with you?

1170
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,031
All right Mr. Holmes,

1171
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,631
if you think you
can be any help.

1172
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,108
I think I'll come
along too Holmes.

1173
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,405
No Watson you stay here.

1174
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,570
These are the
last two members

1175
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,670
of the Good Comrades,

1176
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,612
their safety
depends on you.

1177
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,150
You can rely on me Holmes.

1178
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,482
Pass the wine
along would you.

1179
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,692
Excuse me please.

1180
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,317
Excuse me.

1181
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,486
I was afraid of this.

1182
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,529
Were too late.

1183
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,833
Dead?

1184
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,030
Aye sir.

1185
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,300
Shot through the temple.

1186
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:45,603
How did you know we'd
be too late Mr. Holmes?

1187
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,075
Because we were
not the first

1188
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,236
to read MacGregor's
message.

1189
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,210
What?

1190
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,507
Look here Lestrade.

1191
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,344
This envelope has been
steamed open and resealed.

1192
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,544
Blimey so it is.

1193
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,746
Poor chap, he must
have known too much.

1194
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,846
Has the coroner
been here Sergeant?

1195
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,686
He's on his way sir.

1196
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,623
All right.

1197
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,390
You won't find them.

1198
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,556
What do you mean?

1199
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:09,690
Orange pips.

1200
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,859
Why not?

1201
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,367
Ain't this the work of
the Driercliff murderer?

1202
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,835
Obviously but this isn't
part of the same pattern

1203
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,337
as the others.

1204
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,702
They followed a
preordained plan,

1205
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,105
where as this murder

1206
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,506
was actuated by
some necessity

1207
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:20,804
and could not have
been anticipated.

1208
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,505
Come again Mr.
Holmes in English.

1209
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,206
I mean that I'm beginning
to see daylight.

1210
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,010
Well frankly I ain't.

1211
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,812
I like good, solid clues

1212
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,512
and people I can question.

1213
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,248
Did anybody hear
the shot Sergeant?

1214
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,257
I did.

1215
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,656
Do you know anything

1216
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,024
about the note
your father sent

1217
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,323
to Inspector Lestrade?

1218
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,761
Why no sir.

1219
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,129
Did he leave the
house at all tonight?

1220
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,565
Aye sir.

1221
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,195
He went to change
his lobster ports

1222
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,240
down in the caldron
at Driercliff.

1223
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,707
He didn't return
until after dark.

1224
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,368
Here let me question her.

1225
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,605
Did anyone call on your
father this evening

1226
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,773
after he got home?

1227
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,908
No one that I saw sir.

1228
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,077
Well tell me just
what happened.

1229
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,485
I was in the kitchen

1230
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,491
when I heard the shot.

1231
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,151
I ran in

1232
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,559
and found my father...

1233
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,187
I'm sorry my dear.

1234
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,232
We won't bother
you any further.

1235
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,291
Thank you sir.

1236
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,405
This case gets more
confusing every minute.

1237
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,633
We don't know a
thing more now

1238
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,902
than we did before.

1239
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,409
On the contrary,
my dear Lestrade.

1240
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,944
MacGregor saw something
at Driercliff tonight

1241
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,673
and that something
caused his death.

1242
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:31,975
That's right.

1243
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,676
We'd better get
back to that house
as fast as we can.

1244
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,551
I'll be glad to get
back to Baker Street.

1245
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,011
Someone's going
to get murdered

1246
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,845
if were not careful.

1247
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,228
Merrivale?

1248
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,169
You there?

1249
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,869
Empty.

1250
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:39,877
That's very funny.

1251
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,715
Can't have gone out
on a night like this.

1252
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:57,024
Alastair?

1253
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,125
Mr. Alastair?

1254
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,939
Gone.

1255
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:14,415
Mr. Alastair?

1256
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,264
Mr. Alastair?

1257
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,867
Open.

1258
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,666
Funny.

1259
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,065
Both missing.

1260
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,829
Very fishy.

1261
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,934
Broken mirror.

1262
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,740
That's done it.

1263
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,303
Seven years bad luck.

1264
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,642
What's that?

1265
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,779
Mrs. Monteith!

1266
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,757
Mrs. Monteith!

1267
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,488
Where is that woman?

1268
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,768
Nothing like
being prepared...

1269
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,901
who is it out there?

1270
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,713
Locked!

1271
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,051
Mrs. Monteith!

1272
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,852
Mrs. Monteith!

1273
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,510
They left the door open.

1274
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,104
The door I closed.

1275
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,412
Someone moved that chair.

1276
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,567
Sand still or I'll shoot!

1277
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:56,011
You're moving,
I warned you.

1278
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:01,548
Done for you all right.

1279
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,748
Stand still.

1280
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:06,982
Sorry.

1281
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,581
All in the line of duty.

1282
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,092
Who's that?

1283
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,100
Watson what on
earth are you up to?

1284
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,760
Holmes, thank
heavens you arrived,

1285
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,098
you're just in time.

1286
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,502
They're all
around the house.

1287
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,800
They've got me
completely surrounded.

1288
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,102
They?

1289
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,302
There they are.

1290
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,038
Great Scott!

1291
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,602
I'm so ashamed.

1292
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,113
Got the wind up
over nothing.

1293
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,513
Oh yes, I forgot,
there was something.

1294
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,845
Alastair and Merrivale
are both missing.

1295
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:36,078
What?

1296
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,518
Oh no not dead.

1297
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:38,747
Well they're not
in there rooms.

1298
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,414
You come along with
me and I'll show you.

1299
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,272
Anything wrong gentlemen?

1300
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,368
Have you left this here
room since you retired?

1301
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,605
Certainly not.

1302
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,079
I've been reading.

1303
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,740
What?

1304
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,647
What's the trouble?

1305
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,049
There's no trouble at all.

1306
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,678
Please forgive us.

1307
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,861
Well now we'll try
Alastair's room.

1308
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,898
Right you are.

1309
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,762
Better try knocking
this time, Watson.

1310
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,064
Come in.

1311
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,773
What is it?

1312
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:40,509
Have you been out of
room Mr. Alastair?

1313
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,677
Yes for just a few minutes

1314
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,515
I went down to the kitchen

1315
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,749
and I had such a
nice glass of milk.

1316
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,347
Milk?

1317
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,588
Yes, it was
most refreshing.

1318
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:52,889
Glass of milk.

1319
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,430
Don't disturb him.

1320
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:58,995
glass of milk?

1321
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,058
He's lying Holmes.

1322
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:02,161
Probably just one of
your emanations Doctor...

1323
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,104
Rubbish and the word is
called hallucinations.

1324
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,471
Whatever they are

1325
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,908
they had you
surrounded downstairs.

1326
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,412
It's all right
Mrs. Monteith.

1327
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,514
I heard noises upstairs.

1328
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:24,617
I thought the murderer
must be a prowl again.

1329
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:26,286
What are doing
with that cleaver?

1330
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:28,490
You have nothing
to fear now.

1331
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,998
Well I'll be
getting back to bed.

1332
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,366
Not a bad idea.

1333
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,132
I've had enough of
this for one day.

1334
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:40,006
Oh uh, Mrs.
Monteith, please.

1335
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,139
The note you gave
Inspector Lestrade,

1336
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,737
was it pushed under
the door like the rest?

1337
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:45,610
Aye.

1338
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,115
Was there anything

1339
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,650
different about
it this time?

1340
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,514
Think Mrs. Monteith.

1341
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,883
Well...

1342
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,285
Yes?

1343
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,016
Just before I found
the note under the door

1344
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,352
I happened to look

1345
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,323
through the
kitchen window

1346
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,985
and I saw a man running
away from the house,

1347
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,120
as if Satan himself
were after him.

1348
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,356
Did you recognize him?

1349
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,455
No.

1350
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:03,726
He was too far away

1351
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,563
but he was dressed
like a fisherman.

1352
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,125
Hadn't we better
go down the village

1353
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,534
and find him
at once Holmes?

1354
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:09,902
You'd only be
wasting your time.

1355
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,201
Why?

1356
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,400
Because all the fisherman

1357
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,737
have gone off
with the fleet

1358
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,572
and they won't be back

1359
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,770
until tomorrow night.

1360
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:22,813
It's after nine now.

1361
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,114
Are you quite sure

1362
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,654
that the fisherman
are coming here?

1363
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,950
Aye sir, they always do.

1364
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,149
A long stretch
on the water

1365
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,691
gives them an
awful thirst.

1366
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:30,987
Why the boats must be in.

1367
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,551
Here they come now sir.

1368
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,967
Gentlemen!

1369
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,008
Gentlemen!

1370
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,374
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

1371
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:49,912
Last night MacGregor
sent one of you

1372
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:51,537
with a note to
Driercliff House.

1373
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:55,175
Who was it?

1374
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:56,479
Speak up please,

1375
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,544
it's vitally important.

1376
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:09,856
If I did take a note
for old Alex what of it?

1377
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,401
Perhaps you can help me
to find his murderer.

1378
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:13,902
Where did he
give you this?

1379
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,369
Down at the cove.

1380
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,167
He was waiting there when
we came in from the net.

1381
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,764
What did he say when
he gave it to you?

1382
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,070
Well he just asked me

1383
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,303
if I'd take it
to Driercliff

1384
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,572
for a half a pound

1385
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,112
and I wouldn't have
done it for a penny less.

1386
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,977
Cause of the sinister
legend of the place, hey?

1387
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,914
What else did
MacGregor say to you?

1388
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:31,010
Well he asked me if
I believed in ghosts

1389
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,884
and I said certainly not.

1390
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,947
And he said no more do I

1391
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,355
and he gave me the note

1392
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,654
and the half pound.

1393
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:38,819
Thank you my friend,

1394
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,021
you've been very helpful.

1395
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,120
A round of drinks
for these gentlemen

1396
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,357
with my compliments.

1397
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,524
Thank you.

1398
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,658
Watson.

1399
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,894
Helpful?

1400
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,129
I can't see
anything very helpful

1401
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,898
about that conversation.

1402
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:50,667
All he did was
talk about ghosts.

1403
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,105
And what do ghosts
suggest to you Watson?

1404
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,642
I don't know, graveyards?

1405
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,904
Exactly.

1406
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,809
Alec MacGregor
was buried today.

1407
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,551
I say old fellow

1408
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:09,956
what about
giving me a hand?

1409
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,391
You're doing
splendidly Watson.

1410
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,595
I say Holmes,

1411
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,163
I never did trust

1412
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,868
any of those people
from the start.

1413
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,001
Who

1414
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,408
Who?

1415
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,276
The so-called Good
Comrades and that woman.

1416
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,406
Who

1417
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,474
Mrs. Monteith naturally

1418
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,646
who do you think I meant?

1419
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,121
Old fellow where are you?

1420
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:42,624
Who

1421
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,092
You Holmes of course.

1422
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,719
Who

1423
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,991
Oh.

1424
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,589
Having a nice
little chat Watson?

1425
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,100
Oh there you are.

1426
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,499
Stupid bird up there.

1427
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,003
Silly bird

1428
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,266
hanging about a
graveyard all night.

1429
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,433
Nothing else to do.

1430
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,967
Interrupting a
fellow's conversation.

1431
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,536
Got it Holmes.

1432
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:07,378
Help me now.

1433
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,509
I don't like this Holmes.

1434
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,429
Amazing Holmes.

1435
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:25,229
As I thought, empty.

1436
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,235
Some body snatchers
got here a head of us.

1437
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,861
MacGregor's corpse
has been removed.

1438
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:29,905
What?

1439
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,066
Hurry Watson.

1440
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,699
Come along fellow,

1441
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,300
we haven't a
moment to lose.

1442
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,470
What's up Holmes?

1443
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:37,672
Unless I'm
greatly mistaken

1444
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,214
there's about to
be another murder.

1445
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,749
Who

1446
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,910
You, you wall-eyed idiot

1447
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,044
if you don't shut up.

1448
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,520
Who, Who

1449
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,419
You know what to do?

1450
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,552
Yes sir.

1451
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,891
Get going and hurry.

1452
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,225
I'm afraid were
too late Watson.

1453
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,304
Where's the body Lestrade?

1454
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,430
Which one is it?

1455
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,473
Doctor Merrivale.

1456
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,803
I found him at the
bottom of the cliff.

1457
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,899
Crushed to a jelly
by a huge rock.

1458
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:08,034
Good heavens.

1459
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,942
I identified by the suit
of clothes he was wearing

1460
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,207
and his watch.

1461
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,509
So Alastair must
be the murderer?

1462
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,243
You're right to the
stop of the class,

1463
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,477
Doctor Watson.

1464
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,644
He killed them all
one after another

1465
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,811
for the insurance money.

1466
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,013
I thought so.

1467
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,055
Obvious from the start.

1468
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,420
What have you done with
your prisoner Inspector?

1469
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,686
Oh he's safe enough.

1470
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,421
Safe enough?

1471
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,860
Yes he's in the library.

1472
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,261
Perhaps I better go
and keep an eye on him.

1473
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,491
Oh you'll be all
right Doctor.

1474
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,090
He's handcuffed.

1475
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,805
All pacing up and down.

1476
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,807
Just doing a bit of
measuring Lestrade.

1477
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,672
Why don't upset
yourself Mr. Holmes,

1478
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,438
you can't expect to
solve every case.

1479
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,143
Awe, there you are.

1480
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,308
I suspected you
from the start.

1481
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:49,681
Said to Holmes

1482
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,117
that old front is
too good to be true.

1483
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:52,586
But I didn't kill anybody.

1484
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:53,883
Really I didn't.

1485
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,016
It's quite natural for
you to deny your guilt.

1486
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,252
Criminal instinct.

1487
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,555
What?

1488
00:59:58,628 --> 00:59:59,686
Nothing.

1489
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,059
Got any tobacco on you?

1490
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,290
No.

1491
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:03,957
I don't smoke but
there's Simpson's there.

1492
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,967
He won't need it anymore.

1493
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,502
Poor Simpson.

1494
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,333
Well if Holmes can
smoke the beastly stuff

1495
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,464
I suppose I can.

1496
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,210
That's funny.

1497
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,111
This may be important.

1498
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,786
I must tell
Holmes at once.

1499
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:28,855
Dear me.

1500
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:34,355
Twenty-eight feet,

1501
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,795
it checks exactly.

1502
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,059
Whatever that may mean.

1503
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,259
It means that the final
piece of the puzzle

1504
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:39,460
is falling into place.

1505
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,627
Oh you can have
your puzzle

1506
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:41,727
I've got the murderer.

1507
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,032
Holmes?

1508
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:44,539
Come on Lestrade.

1509
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,738
Where's Doctor Watson?

1510
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,748
Oh he went through
that very door

1511
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,579
only a few moments
ago looking for you.

1512
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,085
We heard a scream did you?

1513
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,484
Oh dear me no.

1514
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,816
That's strange.

1515
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,049
We didn't see him

1516
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,352
as we came through
the dining room.

1517
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:03,722
Did he say anything
before he left?

1518
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:04,987
Yes.

1519
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,120
He wasn't very
kind to me at first.

1520
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,255
He was standing just
where your standing

1521
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,560
Mr. Holmes.

1522
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,567
He asked me if
had any tobacco

1523
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,728
but as you know
I don't smoke.

1524
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,431
And I suggested
that he might take

1525
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,996
some of Captain Simpson's.

1526
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,405
Well he pulled
out his pipe

1527
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,033
and he was just
about to fill it

1528
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,372
when he said,

1529
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,913
Oh this may be important.

1530
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,643
I must see Holmes at once.

1531
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:30,413
Thank you, Mr. Alastair.

1532
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,881
And don't you move.

1533
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:40,656
This wall measures
twenty-eight feet outside

1534
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,425
and inside it's obviously
several feet less.

1535
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:43,829
Oh what are you
looking for?

1536
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,060
Entrance to a passage.

1537
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,192
What passage?

1538
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,702
It could only be in
that outside wall.

1539
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,738
Oh we could knock the wall
down for you Mr. Holmes.

1540
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,068
What you don't
realize, Lestrade,

1541
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,402
is they're desperate.

1542
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:53,737
They'd stop at nothing

1543
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:54,777
and they've got
Doctor Watson.

1544
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,004
They, who's they?

1545
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,273
Get those
candles will you?

1546
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,541
All right.

1547
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,416
What are you doing here?

1548
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,511
I don't like to be alone.

1549
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:12,991
Got it.

1550
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:13,994
Good gracious.

1551
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:15,690
That was for the
entrance to the stairs

1552
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,562
leading to the old
smuggler's cave

1553
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:18,998
down below.

1554
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,933
I forgot it was there.

1555
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:22,834
Give me the light.

1556
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,068
Oh dear.

1557
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,821
Blimey!

1558
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,491
Quiet they'll hear us.

1559
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,296
Who's they?

1560
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,180
See for yourself Lestrade.

1561
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,583
Lord (unintelligible)

1562
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,491
Well strike me down.

1563
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,331
All right
everybody, hands up,

1564
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,837
you're under arrest.

1565
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,066
But who's in there?

1566
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,107
The Good Comrades.

1567
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:33,267
Oh no, no.

1568
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,366
They're dead.

1569
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,705
Are they?

1570
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,541
Come on now into
the line all of you.

1571
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,909
I thought you
were all dead.

1572
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,544
That's what they
wanted us to think.

1573
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,248
Watson!

1574
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,483
Raeburn,

1575
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:49,525
King,

1576
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:50,650
Davies,

1577
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:51,715
Cosgrave,

1578
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:52,852
Merrivale,

1579
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,089
Simpson,

1580
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:58,361
how dreadful of you.

1581
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,958
Thank heaven
your safe Watson.

1582
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,367
Well thank heavens
you came Holmes.

1583
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:02,631
In another minute

1584
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:03,933
they would have
thrown me in the sea

1585
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,166
and got away on a boat

1586
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,435
chartered by Simpson.

1587
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,636
It's out there
now off shore.

1588
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:19,954
Congratulations Lestrade.

1589
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,250
You bagged the lot.

1590
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,586
That's all right
Mr. Holmes.

1591
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,148
And may I congratulate
you gentlemen

1592
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,058
on a very ingenious plan.

1593
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,220
I must confess

1594
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,695
if you wouldn't have
over embellished

1595
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,231
into the business
of the orange pips

1596
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,527
this sinister
significance

1597
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,932
of the happenings
of Driercliff House

1598
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,435
might have escaped my
attention all together.

1599
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,663
Your quite eloquent
Mr. Holmes.

1600
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:37,035
And if Captain Simpson

1601
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:38,801
hadn't removed his
tobacco from the library

1602
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,740
you might still have
perfected your escape.

1603
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,141
Incidentally, Lestrade,

1604
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,337
I think you'll find

1605
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:44,606
that each of
these gentlemen

1606
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,704
has his share of
the insurance money

1607
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,375
probably in a
well-stuffed money belt.

1608
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,282
You fool Simpson.

1609
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,184
I told you somebody would
notice that tobacco jar.

1610
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,517
A fool am I?

1611
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,147
Who asked this detective
to come stay at the house?

1612
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,316
He did.

1613
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,791
I had to the way you and
Merrivale were acting.

1614
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,191
Shut up Cosgrave.

1615
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,286
Don't tell me to shut up.

1616
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,557
You and your orange pips.

1617
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,825
You said they would
divert suspicion

1618
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:03,923
but did they?

1619
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,967
No.

1620
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,399
You and your orange
pips fixed us.

1621
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:07,902
All right, all right,

1622
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,096
get back into
line all of you.

1623
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:10,138
Now come on.

1624
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:11,298
You get back into
line all of you.

1625
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:13,001
Now then, hand
over that money.

1626
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,368
Here, here, here

1627
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,639
no more tricks like that.

1628
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:18,907
If it hadn't been

1629
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,278
for the sharp eyes
of Mr. Holmes here

1630
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,509
you might of...

1631
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,882
you might of shot someone.

1632
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,012
And I thought you
were my friends.

1633
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,715
Such good friends.

1634
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,382
How could you?

1635
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,187
Never mind my good men,

1636
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,693
you'll soon be
in the dump

1637
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,854
with the rest of them.

1638
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,158
No, Lestrade,

1639
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,493
Mr. Alastair's
completely innocent.

1640
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:39,363
They selected him
as their dupe.

1641
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,130
Oh.

1642
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:44,036
It's all clear to me,
Holmes, except one thing,

1643
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,835
why did they
kill MacGregor?

1644
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,967
Because MacGregor didn't
believe in ghosts.

1645
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,376
One night on the beach

1646
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:52,471
he saw a man he
thought was dead,

1647
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,880
probably our friend
big foot there

1648
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,418
and was rash enough

1649
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,350
to write Lestrade
a note about it.

1650
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,480
That note was his
death warrant.

1651
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,581
Very pretty
theorizing Mr. Holmes

1652
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,023
but you can't
prove a thing.

1653
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,492
That remains to be seen.

1654
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,552
Lestrade will
you pick up

1655
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,120
Captain Simpson's
revolver

1656
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:12,690
and have a look at it?

1657
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:14,258
One bullet fired?

1658
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,702
That's right Mr. Holmes.

1659
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,261
I have no doubt that the
ballistics will prove

1660
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,808
that the missing bullet
killed Alex MacGregor.

1661
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,274
It's good enough for me.

1662
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:22,538
If what you say is
true Mr. Holmes

1663
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:24,203
there ain't a jury
in the country that
won't convict them.

1664
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:32,082
And so just retribution
has been visited

1665
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,416
upon the six members

1666
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,683
of the Good Comrades,

1667
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:36,019
whose nefarious plan

1668
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,354
was unmasked in
the nick of time.

1669
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,893
By the brilliant
detective work

1670
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,394
of Inspector Lestrade

1671
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,431
of Scotland Yard.

1672
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,090
Of all the balderdash,

1673
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,793
Lestrade hasn't got
the faintest idea

1674
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,165
what it was all about.

1675
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,669
I don't know Watson.

1676
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,467
After all we know
who is responsible

1677
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:51,801
for solving the mystery

1678
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,239
of the Good Comrades.

1679
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,469
That's right.

1680
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,807
If it hadn't been
for Mr. Holmes

1681
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,575
that headline might
have been about me.

1682
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:01,275
Mr. Holmes one
thing puzzles me.

1683
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,408
What?

1684
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,214
How did they manage
those fake murders?

1685
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,584
Oh elementary my dear
Charles, elementary.

1686
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:07,986
I can explain all that.

1687
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:09,354
Whenever there
was a funeral

1688
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,484
of some old chap in
the neighborhood

1689
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,788
they dug up the body

1690
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,056
and dressed it
in the clothes

1691
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,358
of all their members,

1692
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,591
then they staged
a fake death

1693
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:17,825
and mutilated the body

1694
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,094
beyond all
recognition.

1695
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:20,362
In the meantime,

1696
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,562
the so-called corpse

1697
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:22,865
disappeared quietly
into the smuggler's room

1698
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,633
underneath
Driercliff House.

1699
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,969
I think...

1700
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,169
I think that about
sums the whole thing.

1701
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,404
Tell me Doctor Watson,

1702
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,139
in the simulated death
of Captain Simpson

1703
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,578
how do you account

1704
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,344
for the tattooing
on the torso?

1705
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:39,081
Tattooing on the torso...

1706
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,090
well I...

1707
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:46,026
Go on Watson, tell him.

1708
01:07:46,095 --> 01:07:50,998
Well the tattoo...

1709
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,264
well the tattooing
on the torso...

1710
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,735
sorry Holmes.

1711
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,136
Captain Simpson
was an expert

1712
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,400
with a tattoo needle.

1713
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,964
He merely duplicated
the poor rigged ship

1714
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,566
on the chest
of the corpse.

1715
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,942
I also observed that
the design on the torso

1716
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,571
had been done
within the previous

1717
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:06,876
twenty-four hours.

1718
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,246
Dear me.

1719
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,614
What a gruesome idea.

1720
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,016
Out of gratitude of
what you've done

1721
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,418
the companies
that I represent

1722
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:13,819
wish you to accept
this check.

1723
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:15,083
No Mr. Chalmers,

1724
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,419
I think Mr.
Alastair here

1725
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,857
is much more deserving

1726
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,121
of a reward than I am.

1727
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,095
Dear me they took
me in completely.

1728
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,721
I didn't help you
solve the case.

1729
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,993
No but you did
much more than that.

1730
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,295
It was your timely warning

1731
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,562
when you drew
our attention

1732
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:29,228
to the empty tobacco jar

1733
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:30,602
and saved the life

1734
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,004
of my dear friend
and colleague,

1735
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:34,872
Doctor John H. Watson.

1736
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,434
That's very nice
of you old man.

1737
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:38,139
And by enabling us
to continue our long

1738
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,444
and happy
association together.
