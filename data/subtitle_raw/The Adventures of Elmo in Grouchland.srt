1
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,216
Hi there, everybody.
Welcome to the movie.

2
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,385
Hey, we're so glad you came.

3
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,321
Ernie, Ernie, listen.
I'm going to take a shower.

4
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,157
Have you seen my
antibacterial soap?

5
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,391
No, Bert, I haven't.

6
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,226
Oh, now where...

7
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,496
Now this movie you're about
to see is all about Elmo.

8
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:37,131
Who are you talking to?

9
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,732
The audience, Bert.
They're right there.

10
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,706
Wow, look at all those people.

11
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,741
Hey, nice cardigan.

12
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,647
Now in this movie, Elmo
is going to ask for your help.

13
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,150
He wants you to talk
and play along.

14
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,885
- How do we start?
- It's easy.

15
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,753
Just count backwards from 10.

16
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,357
See Bert, that's how you
start a movie, Bert.

17
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,193
Can you all help us count
backwards from 10?

18
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:07,761
- Yeah.
- Ready? Yell real loud.

19
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,764
Ten, nine, eight,

20
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,168
seven, six, five, four,

21
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,870
three, two, one!

22
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,908
Heya Bert, don't you think
you ought to put
some clothes on now?

23
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,877
Ahhh!

24
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,847
Enjoy the movie, everybody.

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,590
Wake up!

26
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:10,958
Ahhh!

27
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,228
Elmo's up, Elmo's up! Elmo up!

28
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,403
Wow. Hello, everybody.

29
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,605
It's so nice to see you.

30
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:30,444
Hey, since you're here, Elmo
wants to show you something.

31
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:34,748
It's Elmo's favorite thing
in the whole world, yeah.

32
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,418
Elmo's blanket!

33
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,820
Come on over
and meet everybody, Blanket.

34
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,592
Blanket? Blanket?

35
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,260
Blanket, where are you?

36
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:49,897
Elmo wants to show
you somebody.

37
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,666
Are you under here, Blanket?
Blanket?

38
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,870
Blanket, where are you?

39
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,873
Blanket? Blanket?

40
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,843
Oh hey there, nice people.
Have you seen Elmo's blanket?

41
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,478
Yes.

42
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,714
Where? Over there?

43
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,717
No.

44
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,854
No? Where is Blanket?
Blanket?

45
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,656
Blanket?

46
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,526
Is it over here?

47
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,627
Yes.

48
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,364
Really? Oh, there you are.

49
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,768
Thanks everybody for helping.

50
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,004
Blanket. Hey, you come
down from there.

51
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:48,789
Blanket. Oh, Blanket,
Elmo's so glad he found you.

52
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,991
Elmo doesn't know what he'd do
without his best friend.

53
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,629
Stop, that tickles!

54
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,567
* Blanket, do do do

55
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:07,074
* Who's Elmo's best friend
always by his side? *

56
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,745
* That's you, Blanket, yeah

57
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,883
* Elmo's best friend,
Elmo finds you when you...

58
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,085
* hide

59
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:24,425
* Elmo's blanket, a carpet,
the magic kind

60
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:28,929
* Elmo never would
ever leave you behind

61
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:34,635
* Elmo's best friend,
let's go for a ride

62
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,103
* Whee

63
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:49,750
* Who's Elmo's best friend?
Who helps Elmo try?

64
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,652
* You, Blanket

65
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:58,959
* Elmo's best friend
won't let Elmo cry *

66
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:06,166
* Together forever
in rain or sun

67
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,638
* We do things like two
but we're really one

68
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:15,609
* Elmo's best friend...
Uh oh, time to wash you *

69
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:22,783
Sir, sir, sir?

70
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,984
There's something wrong
with this.

71
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:26,920
Listen.

72
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,429
It's working!

73
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,174
Hey, you hear that?
Let's groove.

74
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,015
Haha!

75
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,197
Blanket, you're wet.

76
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,135
Time to dry.

77
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:47,668
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

78
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:52,072
* We never would ever
leave you behind

79
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:56,844
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

80
00:07:56,877 --> 00:08:00,514
* We never would ever
leave you behind *

81
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,883
Whoa!

82
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,091
Thank you, Blanket.

83
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,163
Hey, let's go home.

84
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,102
Hi, Zoe.

85
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,273
Zoe?

86
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,645
What's wrong?

87
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,015
I really, really wanted
to go to the zoo today,

88
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,652
but my daddy had to work,
so he couldn't take me.

89
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,120
Oh.

90
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,891
Elmo has an idea.

91
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:48,028
Since Zoe can't go to the zoo,
Elmo will bring
the zoo to Zoe.

92
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,897
Huh?

93
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,964
Watch, watch, watch.

94
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,705
What are you, a lion?

95
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,607
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Watch this!

96
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,577
Oh, that's a monkey!

97
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,216
I know, I know, I know.
It's a pig!

98
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,719
No, Elmo has something
in his nose.

99
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:12,886
Oh. Hahaha.

100
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:19,627
That's funny. Thanks, Elmo.

101
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,829
You always make me feel better.

102
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,930
You're welcome, Zoe.

103
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,336
Wow. Oh, what a great blanket.

104
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,074
Yeah, it's very special
to Elmo, Zoe.

105
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,743
That's why Elmo's going
to take it home.

106
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,310
- Soft.
- Oh, Zoe,

107
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,147
Elmo has a nice washcloth
at home you could hold.

108
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,349
Well, don't worry, Elmo.
I'll be careful.

109
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,819
But Zoe, Elmo wants
his blanket back now.

110
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,287
Well, in a minute, Elmo.

111
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,823
No, not in a minute,
Zoe, now, now.

112
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,792
Elmo wants his blanket
back now.

113
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,827
-Wait.
-Elmo wants his blanket
back now.

114
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,663
It's mine, mine, mine!

115
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,104
Zoe, look what you did.

116
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,374
I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

117
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,143
Zoe's not Elmo's
friend anymore.

118
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,412
What? I'm not your friend?

119
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,981
I can't stop!

120
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,756
Stop Telly, that's Elmo's
blanket!

121
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,691
Elmo?

122
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,326
This is so delicate.

123
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,063
Coming through!

124
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,799
Blanket!

125
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,834
Sorry, Ruthie. Blanket!

126
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,036
Cookie...

127
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,839
Look out!

128
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,373
Blanket!

129
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,979
- Oh waiter?
- One second, sir.

130
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,347
Oh.

131
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,183
Elmo wants his blanket back!

132
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,052
- I can't stop!
- Telly!

133
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,324
- Hi, Telly.
- Hello.

134
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:04,965
Blanket!

135
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,101
Yes, sir?

136
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,805
Oh no, not you again.
Well listen, I'd like...

137
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,475
Blanket! Blanket!

138
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,780
This looks like a job
for Super Grover.

139
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,989
But what about breakfast?

140
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,925
No thank you, sir. I cannot
fly on a full stomach.

141
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,035
Oh.

142
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,781
Huh? But...

143
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:54,481
Blanket!

144
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:57,785
Huh?

145
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,486
Look out!

146
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,761
Could somebody please get up?

147
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:12,299
My little super body cannot
take this much weight.

148
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,466
Sorry, Super Grover.

149
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,303
They crashed.

150
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,272
They couldn't stop.

151
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,775
Everybody's okay.
But where's Elmo's blanket?

152
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,310
Oh, I saw it.

153
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,213
It fell out of the sky,
and Oscar sneezed in it,

154
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,215
and he dropped it in his can.

155
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,451
Oh, it fell out of the sky,
Oscar sneezed in it,

156
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,787
and then Oscar threw it
in his can.

157
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,755
Elmo sees. But...

158
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,259
Elmo?

159
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,493
Elmo?

160
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,164
Elmo, are you okay?

161
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,432
How many fingers
am I holding up?

162
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,800
Huh?

163
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,202
That's two, two fingers,

164
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,171
ah ah ah ah ah ah.

165
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,141
Excuse Elmo, make way.

166
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:04,151
Oscar, please
bring back Elmo's blanket.

167
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,922
Oscar, Elmo really needs
his blanket back.

168
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,223
Oh Elmo, it's okay.

169
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,591
Oscar, bring Elmo's
blanket back!

170
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,593
Elmo needs his blanket
back now!

171
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,862
Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar!

172
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:19,066
Okay, okay, okay.
Elmo, take it easy,
take it easy, calm down.

173
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,234
It's okay. I don't think
Oscar's home right now.

174
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:25,072
Not home? But Gina,
Elmo needs his blanket back.

175
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,207
I guess you'll just have
to wait for Oscar to get back.

176
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,342
Elmo?

177
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,178
Elmo doesn't want
to talk to you, Zoe.

178
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,546
All Elmo wants is his
blanket back.

179
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,483
I didn't mean to...

180
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:40,253
Don't worry, Zoe. Elmo's just
a little upset right now.

181
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:43,590
But Bob, I didn't mean to rip
his blanket.

182
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,359
And then Telly came
and you saw...

183
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,428
Everybody, break it up.
Nothing to see here.

184
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,363
Move along, just
a little monster trying to get

185
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,132
his blanket back, thank you.

186
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:04,311
Elmo can wait. Oscar will
probably be
back at any second.

187
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,613
Any second now.

188
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,615
Waiting...

189
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,551
Elmo's waiting.

190
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,588
Elmo can't wait anymore.

191
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,033
Wow, Elmo didn't know
Oscar's place was this big.

192
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,436
Blanket, there you are.

193
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:33,440
Oh, Elmo's so glad to see you.
Elmo missed you.

194
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,075
Come on, let's go home.

195
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,512
Ahhh!

196
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,613
Blanket!

197
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,916
Hey, Elmo.

198
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,954
Haha. Have a nice trip.

199
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,523
Blanket! Wow.

200
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,061
Wait, wait, stop the film,
stop the film.

201
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,362
Ernie, Ernie!

202
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,429
What's the matter, Bert?

203
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,998
What's happened to Elmo?

204
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,232
Oh, don't worry, Bert.

205
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,969
That's just the way
to get to Grouchland.

206
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,370
- Oh.
- Roll film.

207
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,072
Neighbor, duck.

208
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,573
Ahhh!

209
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,310
Whoa. Blanket, where are you?

210
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,644
Blanket!

211
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,186
Very colorful.

212
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,156
Ahhh!

213
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,695
Wow, that was a fun ride.

214
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,465
Gee, look at this place.
Where's Elmo's blanket?

215
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:36,169
And where is Elmo?

216
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,438
Elmo doesn't think he's on
Sesame Street anymore.

217
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,442
Hey, mate,
you're in Grouchland.

218
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,512
Just happens to be
the greatest place on earth.

219
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:51,518
A place where you can
kick off your shoes
and smell your stinky socks.

220
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,587
Oh no, I think I feel
a song coming on.

221
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,894
Wow, this is great.

222
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,300
Watch your toes,
musical number coming through.

223
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,548
* Hear the steady beat
of sweaty feet

224
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:24,117
* On the greasy streets
of Grouchland

225
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,186
* Smell the stinkweed gag,
the waving wheat

226
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,720
* What a perfect day

227
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,133
* Bring in the noise,
bring in the junk

228
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,402
* Step on a crack,
step in the gunk *

229
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,604
Home of the world's worst
traffic jam!

230
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,374
* Welcome To Grouchland,
now scram

231
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,442
* If there's gum and goo
beneath your shoe

232
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,578
* You can bet
you stepped in Grouchland

233
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,780
* It's against the law
to use shampoo

234
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,715
* So we wash with cheese

235
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,297
You like me,
you really like me!

236
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,399
Now get out of here.
Get my good side.

237
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,701
Oh, that's right, I don't
have a good side.

238
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,137
* If you're growing old
and love the cold

239
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,506
* Spend your golden
years in Grouchland

240
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,674
* Where the streets are paved
in solid mold

241
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,310
* And the stinkbugs sing

242
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,255
* Bring in the noise,
bring in the junk

243
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,457
* Step on a crack,
step in the gunk *

244
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,293
Our motto? I Grouch,
therefore I am!

245
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:44,597
* Welcome to Grouchland

246
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:49,602
* Welcome to Grouchland

247
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:54,407
* Welcome to Grouchland

248
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:58,178
* Welcome to Grouchland

249
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,346
* Now scram

250
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,551
Wow, Grouchland sounds
like fun.

251
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,154
What?

252
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,390
Fun? You obviously don't
appreciate Grouch culture.

253
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,193
Let's sing him
some greeting cards.

254
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,527
Air mail!

255
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:15,862
Have a rotten birthday!

256
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,297
Happy grouchness.

257
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,198
Yeah, get sick soon!

258
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,234
Happy sour 16.

259
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,136
Elmo doesn't know
how to read yet.

260
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,405
Oh, isn't that...

261
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:36,783
What's happening?

262
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,827
Oh no, it's Huxley again.
He'll take anything.

263
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,541
- What's going on?
- I'll take that.

264
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,245
Hey, you're taking
his greeting card.

265
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,746
Mmm, I'll take that.

266
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,583
Hey!

267
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,652
* Soggy Sandy was so wet

268
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,854
* That's why they
call her Soggy

269
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,957
* Watch her do her soggy dance
and after you'll get wet *

270
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,493
Hey little girl,
is that your new
Soggy Pants Sandy doll?

271
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:21,661
Yeah.

272
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,564
You're wrong.
Guess whose doll it is now?

273
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,667
Oh no!

274
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,868
He can't do that.
That's not nice!

275
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,170
Ahhh!

276
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,474
Put me down, you rotten Huxley.

277
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,409
Wow.

278
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,445
Ahhh!

279
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,280
Stop!

280
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,317
Oh, I bet that hurt.
Oh yeah.

281
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,952
Are you okay?

282
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,754
Did someone say stop?

283
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,684
All right, who said that?

284
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,953
Which one of you dares
to question my evil ways?

285
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:22,655
He did.

286
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,360
Elmo said it.

287
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,961
Hey boss,
he's the one who said it.

288
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,764
I heard him.
It's the cute little red guy.

289
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,466
He's the one questioning
your evil ways.

290
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,302
I know that, Bug.

291
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:38,405
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

292
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,341
He also says,
"It is not nice to take things

293
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,842
that do not belong to me."

294
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,678
Isn't that just precious?

295
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,614
Haha. Yeah.

296
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,449
Let me tell you
about something.

297
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,552
It all belongs to me.
If I touch it, I own it.

298
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,586
Bug!

299
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,791
You see this tennis racket?
I own it.

300
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,896
This hammer? I own it.

301
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,933
This velvet painting of Elvis?

302
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:11,504
I didn't really want it,
but I own it.

303
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:14,441
And this.

304
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,376
Elmo's blanket!

305
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,980
You're wrong. You see,
I didn't borrow this blanket.

306
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,416
I didn't rent this blanket.

307
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,718
I didn't even take out a
36-month lease
on this blanket.

308
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,957
I own it.

309
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,394
I think it's made
of all-natural fibers,
maybe 100% cotton.

310
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,595
Very lovely.

311
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,768
Bug, you really know
how to ruin a villainous
moment, don't you?

312
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:47,540
Now get in the cartoonishly
evil vehicle and drive.

313
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:48,174
Sir, yes sir!

314
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,679
No, wait, Blanket, Blanket!

315
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,981
You know, I would really love
to stay and chat,

316
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,551
but I have to get home
to take a nap with my
brand new wooby.

317
00:21:58,585 --> 00:21:59,586
Woo!

318
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,957
Say, "Bye-bye, wooby."
Bye-bye.

319
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,395
It's a blanket!

320
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,596
- Wooby!
- Blanket!

321
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:10,697
- Wooby!
- Blanket!

322
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,798
- Wooby!
- Blanket!

323
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,965
Mine!

324
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,969
Blanket!

325
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,107
Wait!

326
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,445
Stop the movie, stop the movie!

327
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,746
What's the matter, Bert?

328
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,748
Ernie, did you see
what Huxley did?

329
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,651
- Yeah.
- He took Elmo's blanket.

330
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,920
Hold on, I can't look.

331
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,123
But don't worry, Bert.
It'll be okay,
right everybody?

332
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:40,493
Because we know Elmo won't
give up until he gets
his blanket back.

333
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,729
Roll film.
Let's watch, Bert.

334
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:45,998
Okay, Ernie,
but I can't see anything.

335
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,469
Bert, you still have your
hands over your eyes, Bert.

336
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:51,638
Oh. I knew that.

337
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:53,573
Sure you did, Bert. Come on.

338
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,843
Please, someone help Elmo,
please? Excuse Elmo...

339
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,683
Sir, can you please help Elmo
get his blanket back?

340
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,618
I'd love too,
but I don't speak English.

341
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,658
Can someone please help Elmo?

342
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:14,961
Excuse Elmo, that mean old
Huxley took Elmo's blanket.

343
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,030
That makes me feel
so bad inside.

344
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,732
Oh wait, I think
that's just gas.

345
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,168
No, please.

346
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,607
Now what is Elmo going to...

347
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,645
Hey, you're the girl
with that doll.

348
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:35,615
Shh, my name's Grizzy.

349
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:38,851
How come all the Grouches just
let that mean old Huxley guy

350
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,520
take everything?

351
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,221
Well, because the only way to
stop Huxley

352
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,023
is all the Grouches
would have to work together,

353
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,693
and Grouches hate that.

354
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,861
But Elmo has to get
his blanket back.

355
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,531
Shh, shh, okay, okay.

356
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,700
Look, maybe I can help you.
Follow me.

357
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:54,801
Okay.

358
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:59,839
Elmo? Elmo? Elmo? Elmo?

359
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,910
Sorry, Cookie.

360
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,847
Me having a bad cookie day.

361
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,016
Oh, me head!

362
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,985
Hey, everyone, hey!

363
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,922
What's going on?

364
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,924
Oscar said that Elmo is gone.

365
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,226
He probably went down into
Oscar's can for his blanket,

366
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,862
but instead of getting
the blanket, he got
sucked away

367
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,799
into some far-off and grouchy
place and he's
never going to...

368
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,234
Telly, easy Telly.

369
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,970
Oscar probably just meant that
Elmo went home, that's all.

370
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,005
No, actually
the worrywart's right.

371
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:33,940
What?

372
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,908
Say what?

373
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,610
Yep, Elmo got sucked down
through a door in my can

374
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,211
to Grouchland, USA.

375
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,047
Grouchland, USA?

376
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,082
- Where's that?
- This is terrible.

377
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,886
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

378
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,020
Here's what we're
going to do, Telly.

379
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,690
We're going to go down to
Grouchland, whatever that is,

380
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,858
and get Elmo back.

381
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,259
Yeah!

382
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:58,030
Well, all right,
but be careful.

383
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,099
I just had the rugs dirtied.

384
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:09,642
Oh joy, fruity goodness.

385
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:18,818
Come on, come on, Elmo.

386
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,587
Oh!

387
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,888
Come on, hustle, hustle.

388
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,122
- Are we there yet?
- Almost.

389
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,157
Hold your horses, kid.
Gee.

390
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,661
Well Elmo, there it is.

391
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,230
Greedy Huxley's house on
the top of Mount Pickanose.

392
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,634
That's where your blanket is,
all the way over there,

393
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,936
far, far away.

394
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:40,039
Well, Elmo has to get it back
by tonight.

395
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,542
Maybe you're not hearing me.
It's far, far away.

396
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,078
Oh, well that's okay, Grizzy.

397
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,014
Elmo's done harder stuff
than this before.

398
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,582
Like what?

399
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:51,250
Elmo learned to tie
his own shoes.

400
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:54,286
What are you, crazy?

401
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,759
If you go there, you might
never make it back home again.

402
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,193
Oh well, I think
I've helped enough.

403
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,795
Good luck to you, kid.

404
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,297
But Grizzy...

405
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,700
Elmo's going to make it,
you'll see.

406
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,036
Elmo's going to get to that
Huxley's house

407
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,038
and get his blanket back.

408
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:21,347
Is Elmo kidding?
Grizzy is right.

409
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,915
Elmo will never get there.

410
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,154
I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

411
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,889
Okay, here we go, Telly.

412
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,358
One, two, three, push.

413
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,227
Thank you.

414
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:37,730
We're coming, Elmo.

415
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:46,138
That place is so far, far away.

416
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,644
You'll never get there, huh?

417
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:54,113
Who's talking to Elmo?

418
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,782
Oh, just a little green plant.

419
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,285
Me! Hahaha.

420
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,089
How come nobody ever
thinks their shrubbery got

421
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,857
something to say, huh?

422
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:08,828
But I do because I know
exactly how you feel.

423
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,663
- You do?
- I do.

424
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:12,131
You feel like you're stuck.

425
00:27:12,164 --> 00:27:13,666
Yeah.

426
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,403
Well, at least you've got
your legs. Am I right?

427
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,337
- Yeah.
- Well then,

428
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,440
all you've got to do
is take the first step.

429
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,709
Now lend me your ear.

430
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:27,113
* Elmo, get your chin up
Things could be worse

431
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:31,150
* You could have your feet
stuck down in the earth

432
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,821
* I don't see no roots growing
from your toes

433
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:38,057
* Just two furry little feet
And they're revving, revving

434
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,360
* Revving to go

435
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:46,766
* And soon you will see how
brave your heart can be

436
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,169
* Look on up to the sky

437
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:57,243
* Take that first step
and kiss your fears goodbye *

438
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:00,880
Now get up there, my little
red muppet,
and take that step.

439
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,715
That's it. Now look at that,
look at that.

440
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,450
I knew he could do it. Yeah!

441
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:09,688
Wow.

442
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,161
* Destiny is calling,
so listen up, please

443
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:19,732
* You can feel the rhythm down
deep in your knees

444
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:23,302
* One foot, then the other,
your journey has begun

445
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:27,273
* Elmo, believe it, you're
ready, ready, ready to run

446
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,375
* Take that first step

447
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:34,847
* Soon you will see
how brave your heart can be

448
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:38,217
* Look on up to the sky

449
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:44,056
* Take that first step
and kiss your fears goodbye *

450
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,359
Look at that. There he goes.

451
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,197
Hey, I knew he could
do it, yeah!

452
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,467
Look at him go.

453
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,970
That's it, that's it,
just keep on going.

454
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,138
Take another step.

455
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,340
* Take the first step

456
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:07,079
* Soon you will see just how
brave your heart can be

457
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:13,252
* Look on up to the sky
Take that first step

458
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,455
* Elmo, we believe in you
Take the first step *

459
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:19,525
You better watch out,
Mr. Huxley.

460
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,127
Elmo's coming
to get his blanket.

461
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:28,467
Oh, that's rich.

462
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:34,006
He's little and he's coming
to get his blanket.

463
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,342
Excuse me, boss.
Didn't you hear
the little guy?

464
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:41,380
He's taking his first step.
Shouldn't we do something?

465
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:45,852
Well, normally I wouldn't,
but I am feeling a bit
saucy today, huh?

466
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,788
A little parmesan.

467
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,094
Perhaps I should toy
with the little red monster.

468
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:55,794
But how?

469
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,464
No, let me think, let me think.

470
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,069
Wow, his eyebrows are huge.

471
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,072
Those aren't eyebrows.
That's my aunt and uncle.

472
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,239
Maybe if I look at it this way.

473
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,544
I know. I think it's time for
Elmo to take a little trip

474
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,213
to the tunnel, if you know
what I mean.

475
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:15,848
Yeah?

476
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:18,851
What'd you say, boss?

477
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,953
Bug, what are you doing?

478
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:22,989
Just having a little snack.

479
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,357
Hard to do your evil bidding
on an empty stomach.

480
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,526
Oh, sure. Listen, Bug.
Listen good.

481
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,561
Are you listening?

482
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,097
Get back to work!

483
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,435
That was a wild ride.

484
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:40,406
Wow, so this is
Grouchland, huh?

485
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,408
Yeah, land of 1,000 stenches.

486
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,944
Yeah, and I think I can smell
a number of them right now.

487
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,279
Look who it is.

488
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,148
- It's Oscar.
- Oscar?

489
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,383
You look like a million yucks.

490
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:52,885
- Yeah, go away.
- Get out.

491
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:56,355
Take your friends with you.

492
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,590
Who says you can't
go home again?

493
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,426
Oscar, maybe you can get
your friends to tell us

494
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:01,928
where Elmo is.

495
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,263
In a minute.

496
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,498
First, I have to look at
the old neighborhood here.

497
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,336
Hey, I wonder where
that old septic tank is.

498
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:12,571
Oscar, we've got to
find Elmo first.

499
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,106
Elmo? Elmo?

500
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,177
Have you seen Elmo?

501
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,913
Stop bothering us. First,
the little red guy, now you.

502
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,155
Oh look, there's
a police officer.

503
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:32,925
Yeah, let's ask him for help.

504
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:37,463
It's against the law to
ask for help in Grouchland.

505
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,631
You have the right to scream
your head off.

506
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,134
Should you give up the
right to scream your head off,

507
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:45,671
someone who screams their head
off will be provided for you.

508
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,943
Me innocent!
Hello, me needs cookie!

509
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,456
Okay, Sydney, Little Ricky,
Howard.

510
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,125
- Present.
- Listen.

511
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:08,394
I'm going to get the
trap door ready.

512
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,197
You turn the arrow on the sign
so it points in the tunnel.

513
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,431
- Got it.
- Ready?

514
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:13,699
Break!

515
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,337
Howard? Howard? Howard!

516
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,371
Coming.

517
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,744
Oh, man. Oh, ow, ow.

518
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,646
Your tushie bone
is crushing my skull.

519
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,417
Here he comes. Everybody hide!

520
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:42,028
Oh, hmm.

521
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,367
Oh well, this must be the way.

522
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,770
Is he in yet?

523
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,339
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,142
Wow, a tunnel, cool!

525
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,711
Whoa, it sure is dark in here.

526
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:01,713
A little help.

527
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,754
Dark and dirty and dusty.

528
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:13,057
The boss is going to be
so proud of us.

529
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,430
Are you guys still here?
Elmo can't see you.

530
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:21,067
If you're still here,
yell Elmo.

531
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,135
Elmo!

532
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,271
What?
Are you saying something?

533
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:28,440
Elmo still can't hear you.
Please yell louder.

534
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:29,575
Elmo!

535
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,811
Elmo heard you that time.

536
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,314
Hey, Elmo's glad
you're still here.

537
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,648
Elmo needs some lights.

538
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:43,755
Wow, fireflies.

539
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,658
Hello, fireflies.

540
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,229
Oh fireflies,
can you help Elmo?

541
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,402
Can you help Elmo
get out of here?

542
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:01,740
Wow, thank you, fireflies.

543
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,378
Oh, nice hat.

544
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,384
Whee, this is fun.

545
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:14,253
Whee!

546
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:29,768
Uh oh.

547
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,547
Oh yay! Thank you, fireflies.

548
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:46,418
Don't worry, Blanket.
Elmo will be there soon.

549
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:50,756
Impossible. He's still coming?

550
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,229
I'm walking.

551
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,431
The boss is walking,
the boss is walking.

552
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,901
Ow, hot rocks, thorny rocks.
Should've worn shoes.

553
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,236
The boss is walking.

554
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,870
Ahhh!

555
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,478
Baloney sandwich again?

556
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,549
Get back to work!

557
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:39,571
Why is that little red furball
so determined

558
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,273
to get this blanket?

559
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:44,476
Maybe because it's so
devastatingly cuddly.

560
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,715
What do you think you're doing?

561
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,950
Just hugging Elmo's blanket.

562
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,785
Whose blanket?

563
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:56,488
I mean your blanket.

564
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:59,791
Hahaha. That's right,
my blanket.

565
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,693
And I'm the only one
who can hold it.

566
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:10,936
Oh, hey tissue, maybe you
can be my blanket.

567
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,507
What do you think you're doing?

568
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,676
Just... Just holding
this tissue, boss.

569
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:18,577
Whose tissue?

570
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,247
Your tissue, boss.

571
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,515
That's right. Mine.
Come here, Bug.

572
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,618
It belongs to me.

573
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:30,289
* The issue at hand
is the tissue at hand

574
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:35,727
* And I wish you would hand,
or I'll squish you at hand

575
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,729
* The tissue at hand
to the man who can prove

576
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:44,503
* He can be the most
deserving he

577
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,473
* That's me, me, me, me, me

578
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,409
* Me, me, me, me, me

579
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:56,548
* Me, me, me, me, me,
me, me, me, me *

580
00:36:56,582 --> 00:36:57,849
Thank you, Bug.

581
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,619
Oh, I want that.

582
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:01,887
Bug, give me that lollipop.

583
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,423
That's mine.

584
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,926
* Look at all I got,
this lamp, this yacht

585
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,796
* But what makes having fun
is knowing you have none *

586
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:15,000
Come on, Bug.

587
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:18,504
* Some may call it greed
It's not, it's need

588
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:22,374
* A need I love to feed,
the need to have a lot

589
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:25,677
* I give my all
to all I see, see?

590
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,946
* And all I see I give to me

591
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,781
Take it, boss.

592
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:33,319
* I see it, take it,
then I make it mine

593
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:36,855
* My little stamper adds
a pinch of perfection

594
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:39,691
* On every middle
is my little sign

595
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:43,962
* I ache to make it mine

596
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,432
* He sees it, takes it,
then he makes it mine *

597
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,733
I truly care.

598
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,001
* His little stamper adds
a pinch of perfection *

599
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,770
I give and give.

600
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,905
* On every middle is his
little sign

601
00:37:53,939 --> 00:38:00,879
* He aches, he aches
to make it mine *

602
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:05,951
Oh, my favorite teddy bear.
My yo-yo. I love my yo-yo.

603
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,953
* Something old, something new

604
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,755
* Something borrowed,
something blue

605
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,657
* Things that once
belonged to you

606
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,759
* Like this plastic telephone

607
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,527
* I love this highway
traffic cone

608
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:17,329
* This wedding cake
for Joan and Jake

609
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:18,897
* this rake,
this giant rubber snake

610
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,333
* This Chippendale,
don't let it break *

611
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:24,736
Oops, it's true, love is a
many-splintered thing.

612
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,573
* He sees it,
takes it, then he
makes it mine *

613
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,408
You better believe it.

614
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:30,876
* Oh, what an honor
to be in his collection *

615
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,110
It's such an honor.

616
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,780
* It's like a number
that you can't define *

617
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,881
An offer you can't refuse.

618
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:40,786
* He aches, he aches
to make it mine

619
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:45,591
* You say you love
your old Atari

620
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:47,859
* I love it more
He loves it more

621
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:51,597
* You say you love
your new Ferrari *

622
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,432
Mine!

623
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:54,933
* I love it more
He loves it more

624
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,438
* Look at me, I'm on safari

625
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:03,442
* Things I want, my only quarry

626
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:08,346
* I love what is yours
far more than you

627
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:13,852
* And if love means never
having to say you're sorry

628
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,854
* Well, I never do

629
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,723
The lights, somebody turn off
the lights!

630
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:22,894
* I see it, take it,
then I make it mine

631
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:26,865
* I snap a valentine,
a sign of affection

632
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:29,435
* Four little letters
make a word so fine

633
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:33,805
* I ache to make it...

634
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,476
* I see it, take it,
then I make it mine

635
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,679
* I give a stamp that says
goodbye to neglection

636
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,982
* I've got an offer
that you can't decline

637
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:46,084
* When it broke,
disappeared, they're not lost,
they're all here

638
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,519
* The things you cannot find
because they've been
left behind

639
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:50,155
* Got them locked up in a box
with a million missing socks

640
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:58,188
* Everything I've got here
I long to make it mine *

641
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,039
Here's your drink, boss.

642
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,775
Oh, thank you.

643
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,647
So did you think of a plan
to stop that Elmo pest yet?

644
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:18,684
Not yet, boss. I was too busy
listening to you sing.

645
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,118
You've got a lovely
singing voice.

646
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,453
Oh yes.

647
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,122
Why, thank you.

648
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,892
I always fancied myself
a singer.

649
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,761
I almost performed in
the bus and truck tour
of West Side Story.

650
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,730
They said I wasn't
right for Maria.
What do they know?

651
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,533
- I feel pretty.
- Oh, very pretty.

652
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,902
Very pretty.
You should take a weed whacker
to those eyebrows.

653
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,570
What'd I say?

654
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:42,474
Anyway, I digress.
Right now, I need you
to take care

655
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:44,042
of my new arch-enemy, Elmo.

656
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,078
- Elmo.
- Elmo?

657
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:51,617
Maybe you should arrange
a little introduction for him

658
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,720
to the Queen of Trash.

659
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,188
Queen of Trash?

660
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,525
But nobody ever
escapes her dump.

661
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,760
Stop the movie,
stop the movie.
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie!

662
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,529
- What's the matter now, Bert?
- It's just not good.

663
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:05,997
Huxley's being mean to Elmo.
It's just not fair.

664
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,700
Why would anybody be
so mean to our little Elmo?

665
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:12,971
Well, gee Bert, maybe
Huxley just hasn't learned
how to share yet.

666
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,106
Well Ernie, do you think
he ever will?

667
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,810
Maybe, Bert. I sure hope
that he does, don't you?

668
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,879
Now come on,
Bert. Let's go find out what
happens to Elmo.

669
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,080
Okay, good, great.

670
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,584
Ernie? Problem.

671
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:27,085
This way, Bert.

672
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:32,490
Oh boy.

673
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,801
Elmo didn't know it
would take this long
to get his blanket back.

674
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,636
Oh!

675
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:53,211
Excuse Elmo.
Excuse Elmo!

676
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:56,682
Sorry, Mac, this whole area is
closed for construction.

677
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:57,783
- Huh?
- Yeah.

678
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,685
Bring it in, boys.

679
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,086
Slow, slow, slow.

680
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,287
What's going on?

681
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,089
Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.

682
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,123
Stop.

683
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,294
Nice work, Charlie!

684
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,796
Thank you.

685
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,031
You see, we're putting in
a new Tarbucks

686
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:15,000
because there
just ain't enough
of those places around

687
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,902
when you want a nice latte.

688
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:20,005
But Elmo has to go that way to
get to Huxley's house.

689
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:24,643
Hey, look, you're making me
fall behind in my work here.

690
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:27,045
But you look like a good kid,
so I'll tell you
which way to go.

691
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:30,348
- Follow me.
- Okay.

692
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,719
In order to get to Huxley's,
you've got to
go down the path,

693
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,621
through the dump over there.

694
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:39,124
Really? Thank you very much
for your help.

695
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,191
You're very nice.

696
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:45,130
Nice? You think I'm nice?

697
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,765
Yeah, very nice. Thank you.

698
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,300
You're welcome.

699
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:52,804
He hugged me.

700
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:03,081
Ice cream, anchovy swirls
right here, ice cream.

701
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,983
- I'll take one.
- Okay.

702
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,685
Hey, where's my topping?

703
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,253
Oh, right.

704
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,190
That's disgusting.

705
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,025
And delicious.

706
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:16,762
No problem. Have a rotten day.

707
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:20,899
Ice cream, anchovy swirl
ice cream.

708
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:26,204
Oh, ice cream. Anchovy swirl?

709
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,774
How I long for a lick.

710
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:31,142
Oh, Oscar, get over it.

711
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,711
We've got to think about Elmo.

712
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,179
Cookie.

713
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,747
This is hopeless.

714
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,183
Maybe this'll cheer you up.

715
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:39,651
* A, B, C, D...

716
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,419
No, let me out of here.
It's torture!

717
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,121
Let us out, please.

718
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,123
That's it, that's it.
I can't take it anymore.

719
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,959
I demand justice.
I want a lawyer.

720
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:50,228
Call the media.
Start a defense...

721
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:53,264
Calm down, Telly.
Let me get you some water.

722
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,801
Hey, can we get
some water in here?

723
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,405
Thanks.

724
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:02,007
I didn't get any.

725
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:07,245
Thank you.

726
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:21,092
Whoa, this shortcut
is very long.

727
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,395
Very smoky.

728
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:30,702
Ahhh!

729
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:34,172
Halt! You are trespassing
on soiled ground.

730
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:36,341
Yeah.

731
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:37,976
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Elmo has to get
to Huxley's house.

732
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,879
Oh, no way, Bucko.
You're going to see our queen.

733
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:41,947
Queen?

734
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,315
Oh yeah, and this is
her kingdom.

735
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,251
Oh, kingdom.

736
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,887
Kingdom? This looks like junk.

737
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,422
You said the "J" word.

738
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,225
You'll find out
the difference between

739
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:55,326
what's junk
and what's beautiful.

740
00:44:57,929 --> 00:44:59,731
What's that?

741
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:06,838
What's going on?

742
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:11,309
Who is that?

743
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:22,988
* Listen up because this
is all I have to say

744
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,757
* This could be the thing
to get you on your way

745
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:32,931
* Just imagine what is old
is new again

746
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:36,301
* Maybe then you'll understand

747
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:41,172
* I dare you, take
a look around and tell me
that you don't see

748
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:46,077
* Just a worthless pile
of garbage and debris

749
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:51,282
* I see a kingdom,
shining bright

750
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:57,555
* I can see the colors
coming through, yeah

751
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:02,961
* You'll find the beauty if
you look at something right

752
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:06,297
* It's all about your point
of view

753
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:11,236
* In life, it's all about
your point of view *

754
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,972
Yeah, you go, girl!

755
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,378
* Everywhere you look
a story can be told

756
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:23,982
* And the tales they tell are
worth their weight in gold *

757
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:29,287
Hey, hey, that's very
inappropriate! Settle down.

758
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,322
Sorry.

759
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:34,159
* Rotting castaways,
and broken bits of glass

760
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:39,030
* I dare you, take a look
around and tell me that
you don't see *

761
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:40,932
Watch this part.
This is good.

762
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:44,069
* Just a worthless pile
of garbage and debris

763
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:50,608
* Because I see a kingdom
shining bright

764
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:55,346
* And if you try,
then you can see it too, yeah

765
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,585
* You'll see the beauty if you
look at something right

766
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:04,355
* It's all about your
point of view

767
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:07,959
* In ife, it's all about
your point of view *

768
00:47:07,993 --> 00:47:10,428
It's our turn.
Come on.

769
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:12,864
Okay, let's go.

770
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:27,012
* I see a kingdom
shining bright

771
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:31,116
* I can see the colors
coming through

772
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:38,223
* You'll find
the beauty if you
look at something right

773
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:41,592
* It's all about your
point of view

774
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:46,898
* In life, it's all about
your point of view

775
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:54,932
* Your point of view,
your point of view *

776
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,242
Where do you think
you're going? Stay right here.

777
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,081
So who is this
who trashed my dump?

778
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:05,984
This is him, your majesty.
He's a trespasser.

779
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,452
Yeah.

780
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,520
No, no. Elmo's not
a trespasser, Miss Queen.

781
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,489
Silence, trespasser.

782
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:14,592
He says he's on his way
to Huxley's.

783
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,928
Huxley's, eh?

784
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:20,065
Yeah, and maybe,
maybe he's a Huxley spy.

785
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:26,237
Elmo's not a spy. Elmo just
wants to get his blanket back

786
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,606
from Huxley because it's mine.

787
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,042
Well, you certainly sound
like Huxley.

788
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:33,911
No, Elmo doesn't.
Elmo's not like Huxley.

789
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:38,649
No, no, it's Elmo's blanket.

790
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,386
It's mine, mine, mine, mine.

791
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:47,492
He says he's not like Huxley.

792
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,227
Make him prove it,
your highness.

793
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,362
Yeah, prove it.

794
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:52,697
- Yeah, prove it.
- Well, I think it's time

795
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,332
for the ultimate challenge.

796
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,201
Oh, goody, goody!

797
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,003
What's the ultimate challenge?

798
00:48:58,036 --> 00:49:00,038
You have to give me something.

799
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:02,373
You see, Huxley could
never give anyone anything.

800
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,542
That's true.

801
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:07,512
Now if you're able to give,
then you pass
the ultimate challenge

802
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,314
and are free to go.

803
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,516
What does Elmo have to give?

804
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:14,252
Well, you have to give
her royal majesty,

805
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:18,656
and that would be me,
100 raspberries.

806
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:21,392
Ooh, the ultimate challenge.

807
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,961
Elmo doesn't have any fruit.

808
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:33,204
No, no, no. It's not fruit,
dear Elmo.

809
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:34,639
Like this, watch.

810
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,750
Oh, that sends shivers
down my spine.

811
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:51,322
Well, Elmo can do that.
Elmo knows how to make
that sound.

812
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:55,360
Good. Now I want you
to give me 100 raspberries

813
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:57,395
in 30 seconds.

814
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:01,732
Now let me go get
my raspberry counter.

815
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:04,435
- I'll get it, I'll get it.
- No, my turn. I want to get it.

816
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,278
30 seconds to do 100?

817
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,680
Well, that's why it's called
the ultimate challenge.

818
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,282
Ready, set, go.

819
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:20,451
- Oh no.
- Hurry, you're wasting time.

820
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:22,487
How can Elmo do this?
How can Elmo do this?

821
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,689
Oh wait, wait, wait.

822
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,358
Can you please help Elmo
do raspberries like this?

823
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,797
He's getting help.
Is that legal?

824
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,799
Come on. You can do it.
You're doing great.

825
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:38,169
He's never going to do it.

826
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:40,438
No way. Never been done.

827
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,474
We're doing it.

828
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:45,676
Oh, he's doing it.

829
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,212
Good, keep going.

830
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:48,579
You better move it,
you better move it.

831
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,082
90!

832
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,817
Oh, I love raspberries.

833
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:56,687
Wow!

834
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,489
We did it! Thank you.

835
00:51:01,426 --> 00:51:03,694
Well, you did it.

836
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,796
- Yeah.
- Well, no one has ever

837
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,599
passed the ultimate challenge
before, and you did it.

838
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:11,068
-Well...
-He did it, he did it,
he did it.

839
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:15,473
Since I'm queen of my
word, you're free to go

840
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:18,143
and pursue the blanket
or bedcovering of your choice.

841
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,645
Thank you, Miss Queen.

842
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:23,214
And Elmo's sorry for calling
your dump junk.

843
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:24,615
It's very pretty.

844
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,751
Thank you.

845
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:30,555
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, Elmo.

846
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,691
- Goodbye, Elmo.
- I'm going to miss him.

847
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:36,727
Bye-bye.

848
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,797
* It's all about your
point of view

849
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:44,202
* In life, it's all about
your point of view *

850
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:47,438
Go, team, go.
Go, team, go. Go, team, go.

851
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:48,839
Excuse me, boss.

852
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:52,410
Don't you want to play?
This usually takes two.

853
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:54,745
Eh, why should I play when you
can do it for me?

854
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,914
Besides, I think I'm winning.

855
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,349
- Huh?
- Yay!

856
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,555
I told you.
This time I'm keeping it!

857
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:09,260
Hey, Bug.
That was the last ball.

858
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,628
Hey, let's try boxing.

859
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:11,662
Oh no.

860
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,636
Aha!

861
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:22,373
Come on, let me see you
do your stuff, Bug.

862
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:23,841
Come on, give me a
right, come on!

863
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,917
Oh, that little red bathmat.

864
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:38,789
Bug, Bug, Bug!

865
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,358
Stop playing games.
Come look at this.

866
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:44,929
Huh? Wow.
Would you look at that?

867
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:47,265
Boy, that Elmo's
something, huh?

868
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:51,336
What guts, what spunk,
what chutzpah.

869
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:54,972
Bug? You are really beginning
to bug me.

870
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,341
Probably because I'm a bug.

871
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:00,945
What is it with this blanket?

872
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,853
That's it. It's time
to take care

873
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:10,755
of that little red fuzz wad
once and for all.

874
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:17,762
Oh no. No, no, no.

875
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:23,834
Out of my way. It is time
to release the secret weapon.

876
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,836
No, boss, anything but that.

877
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,772
You can't do it
to the little guy.

878
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,640
Oh really?
Well, I've had enough toying

879
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,309
with that little red lintball.
Just watch.

880
00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:43,354
Hello, Tiny.
Come on, rise and shine.

881
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:47,525
We have work to do.
Yes, we do.

882
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,994
Elmo, you'll make it.
Just be strong, little guy.

883
00:53:56,301 --> 00:53:58,803
* I see a kingdom...

884
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,281
What's that?

885
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,587
It's getting closer.

886
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:17,955
Chicken!

887
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,794
Elmo's not afraid
of a little chicken.

888
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:25,963
Why should Elmo be afraid
of a little chicken?

889
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:32,970
That's why.

890
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:35,673
Yikes!

891
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:40,811
Hey, you dinner, stop running
away from me.

892
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:42,880
I'm trying to eat you.

893
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,349
Leave Elmo alone.

894
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,654
Elmo doesn't want to be eaten.

895
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:55,726
Will you stop jumping around
so much? You're going
to make me gassy.

896
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,662
Leave Elmo alone!

897
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:04,702
You see what I mean?
Now stand still
like a piece of corn.

898
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:09,039
Hey, this is not
how eating works.

899
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:14,712
You stay still
and then I sneak
up on you and then I eat you.

900
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:18,516
So come on, I'm ready for
a nice, juicy worm like you.

901
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:22,453
No! Wait, wait,
Elmo's not a worm.

902
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:26,624
Excuse me, I'm not stupid.

903
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,859
- Elmo knows you're not stupid.
- Good.

904
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:30,995
But worms aren't red, are they?

905
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:34,765
Oh, well sometimes...
Well, no.

906
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,967
- Well, couldn't they be?
- No, no, no.

907
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,936
Worms aren't fuzzy.

908
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,839
Well yes, but if...

909
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,509
Will you just be quiet
so I can eat you?

910
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:47,912
Wait! Worms can't do this.

911
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:51,549
* Elmo's a little teapot
short and stout

912
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:54,685
* Here is his handle,
here is his spout

913
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,522
* When you tip me over...

914
00:55:57,555 --> 00:56:01,526
Hey, wait a minute,
you're not a worm.

915
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,628
That's what Elmo was trying
to tell you.

916
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:06,063
You're a teapot.
I can't have tea.

917
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,932
I haven't had my din-din yet.

918
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:11,502
Ahhh!

919
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,838
Well, not quite
what I had in mind,
but effective nonetheless.

920
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:31,155
This is not fun.

921
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,434
Ow!

922
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,443
Oh no.

923
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,614
Are you guys
still here with Elmo?

924
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:57,882
Yeah.

925
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:02,520
Oh, good. Elmo feels a lot
better with you here,

926
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:04,555
but Elmo still misses
his blanket.

927
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,660
Wait, wait, wait,
stop the movie again.

928
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,195
- Ernie, Ernie!
- What now, Bert?

929
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,564
Well, Ernie, this is terrible.

930
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:16,166
Elmo didn't get
his blanket back.
How can it end this way?

931
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,902
- It's so sad.
- Oh, no, no.

932
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,670
Bert, Bert, Bert,
no, Bert, listen.

933
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:21,238
- Don't Bert me.
- No, it's okay, Bert.

934
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,008
The movie's not over yet.

935
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,744
Oh, you mean good things
could still happen?

936
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:27,912
Of course they can, Bert.
In fact,

937
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,880
I'm sure good things
will happen

938
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:33,484
because who'd want
to see a movie with
a sad ending, Bert?

939
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:36,120
- Titanic.
- What?

940
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:38,122
- Titanic had a sad ending.
- No, Bert.

941
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,525
Roll the film.
Come on, Bert. Come on.

942
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,627
- Gone With The Wind.
- No, Bert, No.

943
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,660
- Doctor Zhivago.
- Shh, quiet, Bert.

944
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,638
Chocolate covered fish cakes.

945
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,908
Hey you, Tangerine.

946
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:01,912
Maria? There's a Grouch.

947
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:05,115
No, no, no, wait.
I really want to help.

948
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,183
Well, who are you?

949
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,555
All right, all right,
all right.

950
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,189
I'm Elmo's friend, Grizzy.

951
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,724
Now wait, shh!

952
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,529
Don't let it get around
that I'm helping Elmo.

953
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:19,997
So where is he?

954
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,199
He went to Huxley's.

955
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:26,571
What, Huxley? First this guy
ruined my
beautiful Grouchland,

956
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,238
and now he's messing with my...

957
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:35,012
Oscar, were you going
to say friend?

958
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,882
No, I was going to say
french-fried fish heads.

959
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:40,751
Right, sure.

960
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:43,721
All right, so the little
stinkball is my friend.

961
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,090
I've got to go do something
about this.

962
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:53,698
Hey, listen up, you
Grouch-potatoes.

963
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:55,600
Come on over here.
Listen to me.

964
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:56,734
Why should we listen to you?

965
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,235
You're going to get
my ugly rash.

966
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,605
Go soak your head.

967
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:03,708
You call yourselves Grouches.

968
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:06,076
Look at you.

969
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,345
This Huxley character's
taken everything that makes

970
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,247
Grouchland so disgusting,

971
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,683
and you're not doing
anything about it.

972
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:15,285
We've got to fight
for our trash,

973
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:17,855
stand up for our slop

974
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:22,960
because when they take our goo,

975
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:24,294
we've got to do.

976
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,196
Yeah, that's right.
We've got to do.

977
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,666
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

978
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,635
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

979
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:33,003
I love goo.

980
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:35,606
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

981
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,908
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

982
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,944
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

983
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:42,012
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

984
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,981
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

985
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:45,983
When they take our goo,
we've got to do.

986
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:06,203
Hey you, get up.
You're in my spot.

987
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,905
Get out of my spot now.

988
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,974
Huh? Elmo's sorry.

989
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:14,879
Oh hey, don't cry.
I can get a new spot.

990
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:17,848
Elmo's not sad about that.

991
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:19,917
Oh. Well, what then, huh?

992
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,920
Come on, my friend,
tell me what's wrong.

993
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,022
Elmo didn't get
his blanket back.

994
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:28,425
Elmo can't do anything.
Elmo's just a little monster.

995
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,128
Little? Hey, look at me, huh?

996
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,430
I'm just a little, tiny
caterpillar, right?

997
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,132
- Yeah.
- Wrong.

998
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:38,302
One day, I'm going to be
a butterfly.

999
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:40,104
- You are?
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1000
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:43,040
I'm going to change
into a beautiful butterfly.

1001
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,375
Yeah, I will because
I have what it takes

1002
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:48,378
right here, inside.

1003
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:51,682
You know what, kid? So do you.

1004
01:00:51,716 --> 01:00:53,784
You proved it by
getting this far.

1005
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,853
Just look inside.

1006
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:04,461
Yeah, you're right. Inside.
Elmo can do it.

1007
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,363
Elmo can get to Huxley's house.

1008
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,665
Yeah, I knew you could, kid.

1009
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,069
Thank you, Mr. Caterpillar,
thank you.

1010
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:14,739
Don't worry Blanket,
Elmo's coming!

1011
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,079
Go ahead, eat it.
Don't you
think he'd mind?

1012
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:25,482
-Eh, he wouldn't mind.
-Hey, that bacon's
for the boss.

1013
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,352
And besides, Howard,
your cholesterol level's
way too high.

1014
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,224
Hey.

1015
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:35,459
- Morning, boss.
- Morning, Bug.

1016
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:37,394
I made you some poached eggs,

1017
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,363
I pressed your favorite
pair of slacks,

1018
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:41,732
the ones that make you
look thin and villainous,

1019
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:43,768
and I brewed you some coffee.

1020
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:45,202
Anything about me in the paper?

1021
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,037
Check page six.

1022
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:48,839
What's it say?
You know I can't read.

1023
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:50,741
It says you're a greedy,
no-good...

1024
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:54,344
I mean, a lovely man.
Hahaha.

1025
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:55,445
Thank you, Bug.

1026
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:01,051
It's a wonderful day.

1027
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:04,388
My sun is shining,
my birds are chirping,

1028
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,757
and my humongous chicken
has defeated Elmo.

1029
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:08,959
No!

1030
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:13,430
Yes! And the wooby is mine
for keepsies.

1031
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,166
The wooby is mine for
keepsies, the wooby is
mine for keepsies,

1032
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,202
the wooby is
mine for keepsies,
for keepsies, for keepsies.

1033
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,770
Give me those.
The wooby is mine
for keepsies.

1034
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:21,005
The wooby is mine for keepsies.

1035
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:23,073
Poor little Elmo.

1036
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:25,342
Somebody can't see what's
so special about this
stupid blanket.

1037
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:27,277
Why didn't he just get
a different one?

1038
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:29,479
Maybe he loved that blanket.

1039
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:31,148
Aw, maybe he loved
that blanket. Maybe he loved
that blanket.

1040
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,317
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1041
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,751
Blanket!

1042
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:39,456
Elmo wants his blanket
back now!

1043
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,960
The little piece
of macrame lives.

1044
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,833
Blanket!

1045
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,236
Pesties, pesties!

1046
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,337
Don't let him escape with my
wooby!

1047
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:56,440
Dirty rascal!
We'll get him, boss.

1048
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:01,245
Um, boss?

1049
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,559
Oh boy. What are you doing?

1050
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:18,228
Too high, too high, too high.

1051
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,203
Hey, you let Elmo
and his blanket go!

1052
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:29,840
I don't think so. You
and your blanket
are both mine now.

1053
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:37,614
- No! No!
- Yes!

1054
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,816
- No! No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

1055
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,387
Stop right there,
you mean old Huxley.

1056
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,455
Zoe?

1057
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:49,293
Yeah, come on.
Elmo, are you okay?

1058
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:52,029
Ah, you do have friends, huh?

1059
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:54,098
And don't they look sweet.

1060
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:56,500
I bet you all just have
a grand old time together,

1061
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:59,937
just saying the alphabet
and counting all day long.

1062
01:04:01,238 --> 01:04:02,539
- Yeah.
- Hahahaha.

1063
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:05,842
It's over, Huxley.

1064
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,279
Get him.

1065
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:10,447
Huxley don't pay me
enough for this.

1066
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,281
What do you mean pay?

1067
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:13,984
I want my mommy!

1068
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:21,158
Grouches cooperating?

1069
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,160
How are you going to get out
of this one, Huxley?

1070
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:26,163
- I've got a plan.
- Oh yeah? What?

1071
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,231
I don't know, I haven't
figured it out yet.

1072
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:32,002
Not real villainous, is it?

1073
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:35,672
They may save you,
you annoying red monster,

1074
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,141
but they can't save your wooby!

1075
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:39,043
No, no, no!
That's not a wooby!

1076
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:40,911
That's Elmo's blanket!

1077
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:52,222
Be careful!

1078
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:57,027
That's it.

1079
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:10,440
Wait, wait,
wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait!

1080
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,109
Where's Elmo's blanket?

1081
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:22,619
No, Blanket!

1082
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:27,424
Haha, that's my Bug.
Give me back my wooby!

1083
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,693
No, boss. You're nothing
but a basket case.

1084
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:30,961
What?

1085
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:32,997
This blanket belongs to Elmo.

1086
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:37,601
Blanket.

1087
01:05:41,705 --> 01:05:43,307
Thank you, Bug.

1088
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,441
You're welcome, Elmo.

1089
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:51,315
How could you do this to me?
I thought we were friends.

1090
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:54,218
No, you're a greedy,
selfish villain,

1091
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:57,454
and nobody likes to be
friends with a greedy,
selfish villain.

1092
01:05:57,487 --> 01:06:00,124
Come on, Bug. Be a bug, huh?
I mean, just be a bug
just for a second.

1093
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:01,191
Give me another chance.

1094
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:03,193
Let me give everything back.

1095
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:05,562
I'll give back all the yo-yo's
and all the rollerblades

1096
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,131
and all those bicycles
and all the kids' toys,

1097
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:08,398
all the dolls, everything.
I'll give it all back.

1098
01:06:08,432 --> 01:06:09,766
- No.
- Bug, Bug,

1099
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,002
I'll give back every
single teddy bear.

1100
01:06:12,036 --> 01:06:13,603
I'll give back the sun
and the moon

1101
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,272
and the earth and the stars.

1102
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,108
Less talking, more giving.

1103
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:20,010
You're tired. You're not
in your right frame of mind.

1104
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:22,046
This isn't when you make
an important decision, Bug.

1105
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,113
Bug, Bug, listen to me...

1106
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:26,083
Oh, Blanket.

1107
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,624
Oh, thanks for helping,
everybody.

1108
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:37,694
Elmo sure is
lucky to have friends
like you.

1109
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,729
We're really proud
of you, Elmo.

1110
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,298
Yeah, way to go, Elmo.

1111
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,467
You're one brave
little monster.

1112
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,768
Oh, thanks, Big Bird.

1113
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:47,204
Let's hear it for Elmo!

1114
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,576
Let's go back to Sesame Street.

1115
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,344
I know a shortcut.
Ready, guys?

1116
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:58,715
Let's go, Blanket! Yay!

1117
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:24,608
Zoe, Elmo's sorry
for hurting your feelings.

1118
01:07:27,444 --> 01:07:30,447
Can we still be friends?

1119
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,319
Well... Yeah.
Friends forever.

1120
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:36,753
Yeah.

1121
01:07:41,525 --> 01:07:44,728
Wow, I can hold it?

1122
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:46,763
Sure. What could happen?

1123
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:52,669
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

1124
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:57,341
* We never would ever
leave you behind

1125
01:07:57,374 --> 01:08:01,745
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

1126
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:05,649
* We never would ever
leave you behind *

1127
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:10,654
Elmo just wanted to say
thanks for helping.

1128
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:13,390
Elmo couldn't have
done it without you.

1129
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:16,326
Elmo love you.
Bye-bye.

1130
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:20,430
* Together forever,
the world seems fine

1131
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:24,201
* We never would ever
leave you behind *

1132
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:25,869
See, Bert?
Just like I told you,

1133
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:27,171
Elmo got his blanket back.

1134
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:28,672
Yeah, a happy ending.

1135
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:30,807
Yep, and thank you all
for helping.

1136
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,643
Oh yeah, yeah.
You deserve a big
round of applause.

1137
01:08:33,677 --> 01:08:36,613
Oh yeah, everybody clap for
yourselves. Come on, come on.

1138
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:39,516
Okay Bert, time to go home.

1139
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:41,285
Yeah, I knew everything was
going to be okay.

1140
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,220
-Sure you did.
-I knew Elmo would get his
blanket back.

1141
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:44,788
-Yeah, right.
-I knew there'd be
a happy ending.

1142
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,456
- Of course, Bert.
- See ya!

1143
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,426
Oh, look, look,
look, look!
Ernie, credits!

1144
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,761
Oh, I want to see
who did the catering.

1145
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,530
Yeah, that was really
good toast.

1146
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,432
You know, they cut off
the crusts and everything.

1147
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,634
Bert?
Time to feed your pigeons.

1148
01:08:57,667 --> 01:08:59,636
Oh, thank you. Bernice?

1149
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:00,537
Bye-bye.
