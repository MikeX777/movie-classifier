1
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:12,924
It is cherry blossom time

2
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:17,796
In Katsushika town

3
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:23,168
It is 20 years ago. My old man and I had a big fiight

4
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:30,909
He knocked my head all bloody so I left home

5
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:35,547
I swore I'd never return again

6
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:41,519
But cherry blossoms reminded me ofhome

7
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,023
And the time we kids played at parks

8
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:48,726
River banks, and the temple

9
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:53,026
My parents and brother died

10
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,800
Only my sister's left. I heard

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,205
Still I didn't feel like returning, so I keep my silence

12
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:09,347
But now I'm looking at my birthplace

13
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:14,118
I feel something warm welling up in me

14
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:16,586
Yes, I was born in Shibamata at Katsushika,
in Tokyo

15
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:21,748
Tora-San Our lovable tramp

16
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:31,603
I was born and bred in Katsushika

17
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:35,373
The surname's Kuruma, my given name's Torajiro!

18
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:39,173
People call me Hippie Tora

19
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:51,823
I know you can't marry because ofme

20
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:58,663
So a worthy brother I wanted to be

21
00:02:58,663 --> 00:03:15,213
I tried my best but I could cry

22
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:26,351
The sun sets --- Iuck has passed me by

23
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:30,512
Let's change

24
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,485
Let me

25
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:40,898
Old folks, keep time tothe music!

26
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:44,197
This is Shibatama Daikyoji!

27
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:25,943
Who's he?

28
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,774
Never saw him before

29
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:32,773
Who is he? A local man?

30
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,814
Splendid

31
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:57,775
Holy Priest

32
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,777
Holy Priest?

33
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,646
How doyou do

34
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:03,214
It's me, Tora!

35
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:09,676
You don't remember me? Heizo's son, Torajiro!

36
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:19,097
You hollered at me when I went into...

37
00:06:19,097 --> 00:06:23,693
youryard to catch dragonflies!

38
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:27,068
Yes, I rememberyou

39
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:30,502
You really do?

40
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:33,608
Thank you!

41
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:37,647
Tora!

42
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:43,855
You're Tora?

43
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:44,989
Aunt!

44
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:48,025
Still alive?

45
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,357
Uncle! How's uncle?

46
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:52,597
Alive and well!

47
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:54,799
I see!

48
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,630
Aunt!

49
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:10,113
Uncle. Aunt. I'm back again

50
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,821
Please don't bow

51
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:20,313
I can't greet you ifyou do

52
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:28,866
Figuring it out, I've been away 20 years

53
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:34,906
I'm sure my late parents and brother
were indebted toyou

54
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:36,941
No, no, it's no so!

55
00:07:36,941 --> 00:07:44,715
Ayoung brother, it's fresh ofme to
greet you loudly!

56
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:50,888
So I'll just thank you and beg your pardon
for staying away until now

57
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,584
Well, well, thanks

58
00:07:54,625 --> 00:08:01,632
Moreover, as to my stupid sister's growing up...

59
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:09,334
It is all due toyour guidance and I don't know
how tothank you

60
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:17,676
Uncle and Aunt, I thank you from
the bottom ofmy heart

61
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:28,459
Neighbors all, I've been away a long time

62
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:34,329
Please remember me and be good for me

63
00:08:38,536 --> 00:08:42,139
Enough offormal greetings

64
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:47,338
Uncle, please relax. You, too, Aunt.

65
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:56,587
You've come home a fiine man

66
00:08:56,587 --> 00:09:01,826
You parents would be so proud...

67
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,561
Anyway...

68
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,796
Nothing much but a drink?

69
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:10,392
Excuse me, neighbors. Please come in

70
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,140
Bythe way, not yet?

71
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,377
What? Sakura? Overtime work

72
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:22,713
Working overtime?

73
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:25,716
Working at a neighborhood textile mill?

74
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:29,220
Ofcourse not. She is a key puncher

75
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,257
Key Pun...? I see

76
00:09:33,257 --> 00:09:38,062
Handles the electronic computer at
the Oriental Electric Appliances Co

77
00:09:38,062 --> 00:09:41,699
Electronics? She's pretty great

78
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:44,235
It's an age ofelectronics

79
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,999
Oh, yes, I forgot!

80
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:52,731
This isn't much ofa present but...

81
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,314
Put it on, Aunt

82
00:09:56,314 --> 00:10:00,918
An electron health band

83
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:05,756
Electrons chase out all the poison
and rebuild the body

84
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,458
Expensive?

85
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,686
It's okay

86
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:10,161
Not gold?

87
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:14,165
Joking? It'd cost more than $D200,000 then

88
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,834
But it's not an imitation

89
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,170
Try it and you'll see

90
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,839
Tiny humps, see? Electrons

91
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,543
Enterthe bodyfrom yourwrist

92
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:27,745
It quickens blood circulation

93
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:31,048
Doesn't your bodyfeel lighter?

94
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:36,787
Good for high blood pressure, neuralgia

95
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:40,024
And forwoman's ills

96
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:44,154
Neighbors, come in and take a look

97
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,526
Back, Sakura?

98
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,326
I'm home

99
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,438
Sakura!

100
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:07,684
Are you really Sakura?

101
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:13,018
It's me. Don't you remember myface?

102
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:16,550
Sakura!

103
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,163
Who is he?

104
00:11:19,163 --> 00:11:20,965
Don't you know?

105
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:23,365
Look close

106
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:27,405
Never mind. Nowonder

107
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:31,136
I up and left when you were only 5 or 6

108
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:38,542
Children grow up even without a family.
Awfully big now

109
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:45,089
My...brother?

110
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:48,759
Yes! Your brother!

111
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,228
You're alive?

112
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:52,997
Brother!

113
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:55,056
Sakura!

114
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,425
Have a hard time?

115
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:11,139
Good girl!

116
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:14,885
Going outside

117
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:15,986
Toilet's over here

118
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,317
Never mind

119
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:21,581
Isn't it nice?

120
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:38,634
Do not cry, my sister, do not cry

121
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:49,052
Forwe left our old home, you and I

122
00:12:50,688 --> 00:13:02,065
ifyou cry, I'll never know why...

123
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,174
Sakura!

124
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,574
Come here

125
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,526
What is it?

126
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:29,925
Listen

127
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:38,402
I'll go alone

128
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,737
I should say not! You can't!

129
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:44,640
Theirwhole family's coming

130
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,178
I can't help it

131
00:13:47,178 --> 00:13:50,614
We can't postpone it for his hangover

132
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:55,449
It'll ruin the marriage-meeting ifyou go alone!

133
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,623
I don't mind. My Chief's idea

134
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:04,128
Don't saythat! Have you had a better offer?

135
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:06,289
What'll I dothen?

136
00:14:06,397 --> 00:14:08,766
Do? What a mess!

137
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,901
He's a fool!

138
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:13,301
I reminded him last night!

139
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:16,862
Aunt, what's up?

140
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:22,413
Today's Sakura's marriage-meeting

141
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:26,350
Well...lt is?

142
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,453
And whowants to marry her?

143
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,223
Her company's...

144
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:36,293
You be still! You worthless drunk!

145
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,796
Don't shout. My head aches

146
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:39,830
What?

147
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,268
Now, now, don't fiight. What's up?

148
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,971
It's a wonderful offer!

149
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:50,975
Oriental's subcontractor likes hervery much

150
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:54,934
He wants herfor his son's wife

151
00:14:55,246 --> 00:15:01,418
Your uncle was to gowith hertoday,
but he drank too much

152
00:15:01,418 --> 00:15:04,321
She says she'll go alone

153
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,025
I'm not interested anyway

154
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,894
You mean marriage-meetings are old hat?

155
00:15:10,894 --> 00:15:15,854
Is that what you think?

156
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,535
Isn't it a mistake?

157
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:22,773
Yes, we told herthat too

158
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:26,510
Tora, will you go in my place?

159
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,945
Me?

160
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:32,082
Yes, it'd be a great help

161
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:35,286
Frankly, it's at a hotel

162
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:38,155
I don't want to shame Sakura

163
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,824
I'm not used tofiine hotels

164
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:45,818
Tora'd bejust right. Her brother

165
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,199
Aren't you busy?

166
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:56,632
No, I wasjust brushing myteeth

167
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,152
Hotel's English, but don't let it surprise you

168
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:13,357
Inn for lovers are called hotels now

169
00:16:13,357 --> 00:16:15,459
Don't be scared!

170
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:17,261
That

171
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:19,821
The hotel

172
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,302
What is it?

173
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:08,779
You must be happyyour brother's back

174
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,749
Away 20 years?

175
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:15,719
Yourwork now?

176
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:18,822
What? Me?

177
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,813
I'm a salesman

178
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:23,460
What doyou sell?

179
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,797
Well...books mostly

180
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,732
Publications?

181
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:34,304
Well, yes. Law and statistics too

182
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,540
Well, well

183
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,877
English, hypnotism, moxibustion

184
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:42,780
dreamreading, mental tests also

185
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,617
Nursing, taking out stains, suicide tales

186
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:49,887
whodunits, and soforth

187
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,947
Nothing to it. It's stupid work

188
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,594
A drink to get acquainted

189
00:17:57,594 --> 00:18:00,062
Please drink

190
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,705
In March each year, there's a personnel reshuffle

191
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:13,472
All the Chiefs want Sakura then

192
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,237
Chief. Personnel calls it the Stove League

193
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:23,218
Orders come out during cherry blossom time

194
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,885
I'm sorry

195
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:37,000
Sakura (cherry) is an unusual name.
Yourfather named you?

196
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,305
Yes, but written in Chinese letter

197
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,273
Yes, that's so

198
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:46,174
Like Cherry in Cherry Blossoms?

199
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:51,715
People think her surname's her name too

200
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:54,151
Kuruma Sakura's funny, they say

201
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:56,085
I see!

202
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:01,124
Sakura's funnywritten in Japanese

203
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:07,586
Pulled apart, it can mean,
I'm worried about the girl upstairs.

204
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:09,898
That's good

205
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:11,502
Good, isn't it?

206
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:14,438
Chinese letters are fun

207
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:18,141
Corpse and Water become urine

208
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:21,912
Corpse and Rice become dung.

209
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:26,884
The funniest is Corpse and two Hee. Hee

210
00:19:26,884 --> 00:19:31,555
I guess fart sounds like that to some people

211
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:33,957
Say, you!

212
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:36,660
Beer?

213
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,127
No, thanks

214
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,198
I see. Fine as a cat with furfull ofashes

215
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:43,100
Laughing. It's funny?

216
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,834
There's more. The cat fell in the horse manure.
Not very elegant?

217
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,186
Sake!

218
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,864
Strange, isn't it, for a pretty girl...

219
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:17,401
to have a brotherwith a beat-up face?

220
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,102
Isn't it, Pal?

221
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:20,604
No, it's...

222
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:22,172
No, it isn't

223
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:27,444
Nowonder. She's my half-sister

224
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:29,813
You're tight

225
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,338
Tell us some othertime

226
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:37,187
No, I can't. Poor girl. I have to clear it up

227
00:20:37,187 --> 00:20:41,024
My old man was a woman chaser

228
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:44,194
My old lady's a geisha

229
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:50,300
My old man told me he sired me
when he was dead drunk

230
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,325
Not through

231
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:56,306
When my old man beat me up, he'd say...

232
00:20:56,306 --> 00:21:01,005
I begot you when I was dead drunk,
soyou're a fool.

233
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:05,441
It used to make me so mad!

234
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,919
He fathered me when he was drunk

235
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,087
Brother

236
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:13,023
Should've been serious!

237
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,888
Excuse me

238
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:18,428
Where to, Mother?

239
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,330
Toilet? Please. Please

240
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,500
Can't put offgoing there

241
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,901
Me too. I'll gotoo

242
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,070
Don't worry! Be right back!

243
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,606
I'm quick at it

244
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:34,444
Being fast is sort ofan art too.

245
00:21:34,444 --> 00:21:38,749
Wish I could show you how fast I am

246
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:40,417
I'm going

247
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:43,787
Mother! Which way?

248
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:47,314
Listen, where's the toilet?

249
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:08,172
We're back!

250
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:17,254
Don't worry! I went alone with her!

251
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:21,691
So it was a great success! Through

252
00:22:25,962 --> 00:22:29,227
Is it true? A success?

253
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:33,934
I wonder. Afailure?

254
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:43,580
Don't you cry, sister ofmine...

255
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,883
Who's wetting myfence?

256
00:22:46,883 --> 00:22:50,053
You octopus!

257
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:55,325
What about you? Noisyfrom morning till night!

258
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:59,463
Don't you know there's a girl here?

259
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:03,934
Come here a minute!

260
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:09,239
Crazyworking all daylong!

261
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:12,576
Goto bed when the sun sinks!

262
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:14,976
You lousy man!

263
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:23,353
I was born and bred in Shibamata,
Katsushika, Tokyo

264
00:23:23,353 --> 00:23:28,258
I'm Torajiro Kuruma, but called Hippie Tora!

265
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:34,219
Like you, Tokyo ofthe neon lights
andjazz is my abode now

266
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:38,201
Fate threw us together 'V

267
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:45,275
I'm working like everything for my only sister

268
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:50,380
Whether I travel west or east

269
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,016
I'm always indebted tothe local folks

270
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:57,316
Please rememberyours trulythe Ugly Japanese,
and help me!

271
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:13,962
Tea

272
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,903
Excuse me

273
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:21,778
I'm sorry about yesterday

274
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:23,803
No, no. Sit down

275
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:28,948
Hard getting him home?

276
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:37,818
Mr. Kamakura was here.
He asked to be remembertoyou

277
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:45,035
So I'll give you the answerfiirst

278
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:48,505
I know. He came to refuse?

279
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,741
Yes. I'm sorry

280
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:54,477
It's all right. I knew it.

281
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:55,876
I see

282
00:24:57,881 --> 00:24:59,282
I'm sorry

283
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:00,681
It's all right

284
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,233
Magazines, folks

285
00:25:16,233 --> 00:25:18,997
Dirt cheap. A big bargain

286
00:25:19,202 --> 00:25:22,572
All sorts ofmagazine

287
00:25:22,572 --> 00:25:25,976
All cheap

288
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:29,646
Lousy sales pitch!

289
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:33,350
Can't you do better? Dummy!

290
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,820
Pal? Pal Tora?

291
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,954
I searched foryou!

292
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:44,086
You're trash! I said go home and help yourfolks!

293
00:25:44,661 --> 00:25:48,231
I'm desperate! Take your pick!

294
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:56,806
So desperate I'd bite into a sun-ripened eggplant!

295
00:25:56,806 --> 00:26:00,210
But can't with store-bought teeth!

296
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,748
Girls, made up pretty,

297
00:26:04,748 --> 00:26:09,019
Would pay 500 or 600 yen at department stores!

298
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:14,391
Know why it's cheap?

299
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:20,697
A bookstore couldn't paytax 'V a sacrifiice sale!

300
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:25,368
$D400! $D300! $D200! $D100! How about it?

301
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:33,104
You still won't buy? All right then!

302
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:42,585
I'm back! ls my sister in?

303
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:45,555
There you are!

304
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:48,425
Don't hold back! Come in!

305
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:53,089
I'll introduce toyou to sis. Hurry up!

306
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,032
Pretty?

307
00:26:56,032 --> 00:27:03,200
She's working in an offiice. She's way above you.

308
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:07,944
Noboru's like a brother

309
00:27:07,944 --> 00:27:14,484
He's a fool that you can see,
but the poor devil has nofamily

310
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:22,016
We're going towork together, so look after him

311
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:29,994
Why are you looking so sunk? What's up?

312
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:36,039
How can you act so unconcerned? Apologize!

313
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,241
What's bugging you?

314
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:42,940
Sakura's marriage! She was turned down!

315
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:48,406
She was? She was turned down?

316
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:54,290
Isn't she plain lucky?

317
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,393
That immature slob!

318
00:27:56,393 --> 00:27:59,462
She'll have a string ofsuitors

319
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:02,022
A hard time refusing them!

320
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,968
I see. That's whyyou were drinking?

321
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:08,204
Like a desperate egg-plant

322
00:28:08,204 --> 00:28:10,373
Dark and good to eat

323
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:13,777
But can't with store teeth!

324
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,311
Stop it, fools!

325
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:16,713
Let me talk!

326
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:22,379
Tora, she was turned down because ofyou!

327
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:26,949
She can't expect a better offer!

328
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,195
Frankly, Sakura's an orphan and has no dowry.

329
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:35,899
When it came to marriage,

330
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:38,668
it's been harderthan we'd care to say!

331
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:41,501
Speak right up then!

332
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:45,809
She can't marry because ofme?

333
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,345
Stop it. I'm resigned to it

334
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:52,282
Yes, that's important

335
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:57,921
And you asked me to goto
the marriage-meeting. Griping hag

336
00:28:57,921 --> 00:29:00,790
What's that? Hag?

337
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,425
Mad, old fossil?

338
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:04,327
How can you?

339
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,530
You're indebted to him! Apologize!

340
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,268
Apologize? Only a kid sister- don't be fresh!

341
00:29:12,268 --> 00:29:15,004
You are! Acting the big brother!

342
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:19,634
Don't you know how you've made me worry?

343
00:29:20,577 --> 00:29:23,910
How dare you slap her?

344
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:34,584
Don't be rough!

345
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:54,609
What're you? Afactory hand?

346
00:29:55,678 --> 00:30:03,414
Go ahead, Hiroshi! You've my permission!
Give it to him good!

347
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:09,792
Sure, go ahead! What have I done anyway?

348
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:13,125
Try and hit me!

349
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:16,128
Stop

350
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:21,204
How about it? Did it hurt? I didn't hit you!

351
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:25,008
It was your dead father's fiist!

352
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:32,915
A laugh! His hurt more!

353
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:42,025
When you left, your pa was worried sick!

354
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:46,629
When I saw you again,

355
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:50,967
I thought he'd be so happy ifhe could see you!

356
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:53,570
But I'm glad he's dead!

357
00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:01,010
I bet he'd think sotoo ifhe saw you like this!

358
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,104
He's thinking so underthe sod!

359
00:31:05,148 --> 00:31:07,784
Sakura, my medicine

360
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,786
What is it?

361
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,721
Pull yourselftogether!

362
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,739
Don't stare!

363
00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:57,700
Is Uncle all right?

364
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,895
Yes, he is

365
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,262
Let me!

366
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:37,774
Sakura!

367
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:39,742
It's late!

368
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:50,814
Hurry! You'll be late forwork!

369
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:53,480
My brother left!

370
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:03,900
Sis. I'm sorry about last night.

371
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:12,742
I'm going away but I'll always be
praying your happiness.

372
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:16,075
Take care of Noboru for me. Goodbye.

373
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:20,582
Yourfoolish brother, Torajiro.

374
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,088
There he is!

375
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:31,789
Brother!

376
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:38,468
Pal! Wait for me!

377
00:33:38,468 --> 00:33:40,800
Don't mind! Go on!

378
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:47,176
Pal! Have a heart! Don't leave me behind!

379
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:50,168
Brother! Don't go!

380
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:56,380
Boatman! Come back!

381
00:33:57,653 --> 00:34:02,024
Don't go back even ifthey call you

382
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:05,928
You wouldn't know but mine's a hard world

383
00:34:05,928 --> 00:34:08,123
Brother!

384
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:17,470
Why are you going away?

385
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:33,916
ONE MONTH LATER

386
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,733
Special letter

387
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,169
Special delivery? Whofrom?

388
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:50,273
From Fuyuko Tsubouchi in Nara.

389
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:51,541
The priest's daughter

390
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:53,609
Miss Tsubouchi?

391
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:55,304
You read it.

392
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:01,584
Are you all well?

393
00:35:01,584 --> 00:35:04,787
I have been in Nara almost 3 months.

394
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:11,694
I am well now and Father has come for me,
so I am coming home.

395
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:17,733
Today, while I was showing father around,

396
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:20,133
we ran into a rate man.

397
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:23,995
It seems sofunny remembering it.

398
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,534
Not tired?

399
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:52,762
No

400
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:57,773
It's very noisy around here

401
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:09,986
Hey, Tora-san!

402
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:11,112
Yes

403
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,960
Beautiful, fiine, fiine

404
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,231
Even beauty has its drawbacks

405
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,735
Beautiful but I'm all fagged out

406
00:36:25,735 --> 00:36:29,672
No decent meals

407
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:32,708
But you folks eat steaks

408
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:37,008
Right, Master?

409
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,850
The good priest!

410
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,820
Well, well, how doyou do

411
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,880
Thank you forthat time

412
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:51,494
Here to see how people live?

413
00:36:51,494 --> 00:36:55,898
Why're you here? Your relatives are worried

414
00:36:55,898 --> 00:37:01,037
I was selling things in Kyoto

415
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:07,272
I got hold with them - Take them here and there

416
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:14,750
You do get around. She's beautiful. I'll leave now

417
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,083
Fool! My daughter!

418
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:24,616
Forget? You nicknamed her Popeye
and teased her

419
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:28,197
Popeye!

420
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:33,769
You remember him?

421
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:40,038
Yes. You're Tora? You haven't changed at all

422
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:54,984
He left the foreigners and
stayed with us all day long

423
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:08,165
Here I go. Please smile

424
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:14,610
Please smile, sir

425
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,179
I've none ofyou smiling

426
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:21,450
Yes, a pokerface. Smile

427
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,819
Be still! I'll smile! Hurry!

428
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:25,388
Really?

429
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,356
Smile. Smile now

430
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,686
Butter

431
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,428
What's that?

432
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:37,366
Anyway, hurry!

433
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:38,958
Butter!

434
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:42,838
What's the matter?

435
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:46,330
It's cheese. You mean cheese?

436
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,344
What about cheese?

437
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:49,834
Never mind! Hurry!

438
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:53,983
Yes, yes, here I go smile, please.

439
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,917
Butter

440
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:19,575
Ifyou'll excuse me...

441
00:39:19,575 --> 00:39:24,613
Tora, not returning to Shibamata

442
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:27,416
So, please excuse me

443
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:33,255
Why? Wouldn't Sakura want you to?

444
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:38,160
She can't even marrywith a brother like me

445
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,864
He knows about it

446
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:47,666
I won't insist, but live decently

447
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:55,311
You'll be laughed at wearing those

448
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:58,872
Thank you foryour kindness

449
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:05,154
Please be good to Sakura

450
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:10,259
Not going home? It's a shame

451
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:14,855
Ifyou'll excuse me...

452
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,639
Tora

453
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:30,346
Leaving at 9 tomorrow.
Call me ifyou change you mind

454
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:32,837
Yes

455
00:40:34,116 --> 00:40:36,744
Thank you

456
00:40:39,288 --> 00:40:44,760
Sowe parted from Tora.
We goto Kishu tomorrow

457
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,891
We may be home before this card reaches you.

458
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:55,067
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

459
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:58,808
What's he doing in Nara?

460
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:02,411
Selling kimono goods?

461
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:04,780
Imitation silk, I'll bet

462
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,184
He's a fool, a real fool

463
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:10,653
He should help out here

464
00:41:10,653 --> 00:41:12,354
Shouldn't he?

465
00:41:12,354 --> 00:41:17,626
Maybe he can't live a decent live

466
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,094
He must know it

467
00:41:22,198 --> 00:41:24,928
Excuse me

468
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:31,236
200 yen's worth ofsweets, please

469
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:41,584
200 yen's worth ofsweets, please

470
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:44,075
You will? Thanks

471
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,992
Go out the back way. It's nearer

472
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:51,983
I see. Thanks

473
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:11,313
Humming. She likes him too?

474
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:16,452
Yes. Leave them alone. It maywork out

475
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:18,721
Leave them alone?

476
00:42:18,721 --> 00:42:22,088
Tora would ruin it

477
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:29,298
Miss!

478
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:32,234
I'm back. How doyou do

479
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:34,370
Welcome back

480
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,039
You seem verywell

481
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:41,477
We were talking about you. Please

482
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:43,312
Received your card today

483
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:48,384
I see. You're both well?

484
00:42:48,384 --> 00:42:49,818
Yes, thank you. The good priest?

485
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,888
He's tired. He sent his regards

486
00:42:52,888 --> 00:42:55,791
I see. Thank you

487
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:58,351
Say, tea

488
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:01,397
You must be tired

489
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:04,733
You saw Tora overthere?

490
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:07,036
Yes, accidentally

491
00:43:07,036 --> 00:43:08,470
I see

492
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:13,342
He up and left a month ago.
We've noword from him since

493
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:19,882
We've been worried about him. Is the fool well?

494
00:43:19,882 --> 00:43:25,788
Miss, I saw the good priest and
the luggage safely home

495
00:43:25,788 --> 00:43:28,223
He's pretty old

496
00:43:28,223 --> 00:43:32,795
His hips hurt, his knees knock - a bother

497
00:43:32,795 --> 00:43:36,865
Hi, Uncle and Aunt. You're well? I see. Good.

498
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:40,235
Miss told you? So I'll stay a few day

499
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,601
It's burning

500
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:50,145
I missed this place. It hasn't changed a bit

501
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:55,250
Just an old dump.
See the people here are creaking too

502
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,552
Sakura home?

503
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:59,355
I'd like to see her. At work?

504
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:00,923
She's home...

505
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:02,224
She is?

506
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,452
Sakura!

507
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:13,228
Brother!

508
00:44:13,502 --> 00:44:14,867
Sakura

509
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:20,209
What happened? Back so suddenly!

510
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:22,845
See Fuyuko? And then?

511
00:44:22,845 --> 00:44:26,749
Worried about you, so I tagged along

512
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:29,151
After her? I see

513
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:30,419
Fuyuko...?

514
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,353
She's here

515
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:32,843
Shop?

516
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,392
Back? It's nice!

517
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:40,089
Sakura was worried

518
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,665
Sakura?

519
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:45,667
Acting familiar!

520
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:48,504
Don't come into other people's yard!

521
00:44:48,504 --> 00:44:53,208
Don't think you can hook Sakura!

522
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,944
A college graduate for her!

523
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,348
She's too good forfactory hands!

524
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:03,944
Ifyou know, get lost! She's not married yet

525
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,861
Don't gape

526
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:15,125
Tora!

527
00:45:15,631 --> 00:45:17,366
I'm leaving

528
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:19,357
You are?

529
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:24,833
Pal!

530
00:45:27,009 --> 00:45:29,375
You still alive?

531
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:33,205
Miss! A present!

532
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,717
He's a fool, really a fool

533
00:45:39,888 --> 00:45:43,221
Hi. Gain a lot!

534
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:46,791
What's up? Still a fool?

535
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:53,231
That scum! Only a gangster!

536
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:20,629
Big trouble!

537
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:23,866
My men went to Edogawa
Rivertofiight Tora! What'll we do?

538
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:27,803
Tell the police? A goryfiight?

539
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:30,772
Think so? It's terrible!

540
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:38,612
Say, stop fiighting! Don't fiight!

541
00:46:44,753 --> 00:46:50,893
Hey, acting like a pup caught bythe pound man!

542
00:46:50,893 --> 00:46:54,963
Tora and your man's talking it out!

543
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:56,198
Is Hiroshi safe?

544
00:46:56,198 --> 00:46:58,033
Simmer down!

545
00:46:58,033 --> 00:46:59,768
Is he safe?

546
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:03,939
Hiroshi's okay. He can handle
a couple ofmen like him!

547
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:06,703
Any complaints?

548
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:09,945
Sakura's husband must be a university man?

549
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:13,215
Sure! Griping? Fight it out then?

550
00:47:13,215 --> 00:47:18,585
Tell me. Are you a university graduate?

551
00:47:18,987 --> 00:47:24,393
For instance, you love someone

552
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:28,096
What would you do ifher brother said that toyou?

553
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:33,902
What? I love someone and her brother...?

554
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:36,905
Fool! Got none! Don'tjoke!

555
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:40,409
But ifyou did, you'd feel like I do

556
00:47:40,409 --> 00:47:42,044
Stopjoking!

557
00:47:42,044 --> 00:47:45,214
Not me! Don't insult me!

558
00:47:45,214 --> 00:47:46,281
Why?

559
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,518
Why? You're dumb

560
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:52,387
We're not the same

561
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:58,451
If I eat a potato, would it make you fart?

562
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:05,234
See? Just horse sense is no help!

563
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:07,361
Speak up!

564
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:11,306
Brother. A question

565
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:14,241
Ever been in love?

566
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,780
How about it? Not even once?

567
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:25,709
Ifyou're a man, you must've loved
someone deeply once. Have you?

568
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:35,862
What, you bum? You're in love with Sakura,
aren't you?

569
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:41,470
Talking about love and a whole lot ofnonsense!

570
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:45,741
In a word, you want to marry her?

571
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:47,909
I wouldn't go sofar...

572
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:49,706
Not in love?

573
00:48:50,045 --> 00:48:52,414
Yes, I love her

574
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:56,285
What then? Make yourselfclear!

575
00:48:56,285 --> 00:49:00,622
So as I said, I've nofamily and
I'm not a university graduate...

576
00:49:00,622 --> 00:49:03,458
See here, you. Can't you marry ifyou're not?

577
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:10,565
I see. That's your rule?

578
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:13,101
So brother, l...!

579
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:16,705
Don't call me Brother so easy like!

580
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:22,177
Okay, then, go ahead

581
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:26,982
It's a democracy. Dating, kissing,
petting - give herthe works

582
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:28,417
Yes

583
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:33,655
Yes? Can you hook a girl with you face?

584
00:49:33,655 --> 00:49:38,627
Sakura's got a strong mind. You're confiident?

585
00:49:38,627 --> 00:49:40,228
No

586
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:45,000
No? Awful ifshe turns you down

587
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,036
You make me cry! I'll give you some pointers

588
00:49:48,036 --> 00:49:49,504
Please, Brother

589
00:49:49,504 --> 00:49:53,804
Too soon to call me that!

590
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:57,612
In short, the eyes catch girls

591
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:03,385
I don't mean to stare like this.
They'd think you're crazy

592
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:07,956
Sojust a quick glance

593
00:50:07,956 --> 00:50:09,891
Like this

594
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:14,162
I'll pierce her like Cupid's arrow

595
00:50:14,162 --> 00:50:18,433
So she looks at you

596
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:21,636
Quick, you look down

597
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:23,405
She'll look surprised

598
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:28,310
Meet her eyes then, don't let them go

599
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:34,182
Gaze at herwistfully, longingly,
asking herto pamperyou

600
00:50:34,182 --> 00:50:36,551
I'll mesmerize her

601
00:50:36,551 --> 00:50:40,288
So give a last push --- talk with your eyes

602
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,057
with my eyes

603
00:50:42,057 --> 00:50:45,993
Sure, theytalk. Watch me

604
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,836
Theytalked?

605
00:50:54,836 --> 00:50:56,571
About what?

606
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:58,869
What? Oat! They said, I love you!

607
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:16,447
What is it? Dust in your eyes?

608
00:51:18,293 --> 00:51:22,024
No. Dusty here now, isn't it?

609
00:51:23,198 --> 00:51:26,531
Not here

610
00:51:29,538 --> 00:51:36,410
It's caught. I'll turn it around

611
00:51:36,778 --> 00:51:37,870
Tora!

612
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,413
Don't move, Miss!

613
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:12,848
Brother

614
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:14,683
What is it?

615
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:17,219
Came for a look see

616
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:21,523
A big company. How many employees?

617
00:52:21,523 --> 00:52:24,754
About 1200 here

618
00:52:25,327 --> 00:52:28,396
Men all university grads?

619
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,432
Most ofthem

620
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:32,734
Great

621
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:34,970
Why'd you come here?

622
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:37,439
I just dropped in

623
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:39,908
I'd better run along

624
00:52:39,908 --> 00:52:42,010
Leaving?

625
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:47,949
That reminds me. What doyou think about that?

626
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:49,818
That?

627
00:52:49,818 --> 00:52:52,854
You know. Hiroshi next door

628
00:52:52,854 --> 00:52:54,456
What about him?

629
00:52:54,456 --> 00:52:57,726
Nothing. Just asking

630
00:52:57,726 --> 00:52:59,694
Impossible?

631
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:01,963
What doyou mean?

632
00:53:01,963 --> 00:53:03,692
Nothing. Nothing at all

633
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:10,138
Are the toilets here foreign ones?

634
00:53:10,138 --> 00:53:11,406
Yes. Why?

635
00:53:11,406 --> 00:53:12,641
Nothing

636
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:15,210
My regards tothe president

637
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,939
Sorryto botheryou

638
00:53:26,087 --> 00:53:29,824
Working overtime, men?

639
00:53:29,824 --> 00:53:33,954
Fine, fiine. Work beats poverty any day

640
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:37,933
How was it?

641
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:39,968
Nothing doing.

642
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:43,638
Give up. No hope

643
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,607
Did you ask her?

644
00:53:45,607 --> 00:53:52,672
Sure thing. You're notalker so I put it to her good

645
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:57,052
That I want to marry her?

646
00:53:57,052 --> 00:54:00,488
Sure, but there's no chance

647
00:54:03,992 --> 00:54:06,051
I see

648
00:54:06,528 --> 00:54:10,794
Cheer up. Let's gofor a drink

649
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:12,601
Torajiro

650
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:18,403
Here we go. Getting formal on me. What is it?

651
00:54:18,573 --> 00:54:22,839
Have you ever been in love?

652
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:31,620
I know. I know how you feel

653
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,456
Go ahead, cry. Have a good cry

654
00:54:34,456 --> 00:54:38,326
Say, don't stand around! It's nofree show!

655
00:54:38,326 --> 00:54:40,695
Get towork, lazy pigs!

656
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:43,926
Noworkmen's spirit?

657
00:54:56,044 --> 00:54:58,478
What's the matter?

658
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:10,225
I can see yourwindow from my room

659
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:15,096
When I wake up I watch you

660
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:21,803
You open the curtains,
yawn and put awaythe bedding

661
00:55:21,803 --> 00:55:25,607
On Sundays, you sing

662
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:31,179
On winter nights, you read and cry

663
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:33,114
During my 3 years in the factory

664
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:39,721
I enjoyed seeing you every morning!

665
00:55:39,721 --> 00:55:46,752
It was the onlything I looked forward to!

666
00:55:50,165 --> 00:55:55,737
I'm leaving but please become happy!

667
00:55:55,737 --> 00:55:57,227
Goodbye

668
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:09,746
What's going on? What did he come here to say?

669
00:56:09,984 --> 00:56:12,620
Brother, what happen inside the factory?

670
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,591
Nothing,...what did he say?

671
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:18,226
He said he will leave here!

672
00:56:18,226 --> 00:56:19,060
What?

673
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,628
Brother, wait a minute!

674
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:25,200
Tora, what have you did to him?

675
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,402
What's the matter, yourface is so red?

676
00:56:27,402 --> 00:56:30,438
Nojokes anymore, he wanted to resign!

677
00:56:30,438 --> 00:56:31,406
What?

678
00:56:31,406 --> 00:56:35,110
Without him, the factorywill be fiinish

679
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:37,579
That's a good thing?

680
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:41,116
He needn't slave in a dirty place

681
00:56:41,116 --> 00:56:43,618
Tell him I praised him.

682
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:44,552
What?

683
00:56:44,552 --> 00:56:46,788
Brother!

684
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:50,658
Tell me what you said and did.

685
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:55,597
Nothing much. I said to give you up

686
00:56:55,597 --> 00:56:58,433
Can't be helped?

687
00:56:58,433 --> 00:57:03,304
Then coming to my offiice...?

688
00:57:03,304 --> 00:57:07,509
Yes. You behaved coldly

689
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:10,411
I didn't!

690
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:12,013
Boss! Hiroshi really left!

691
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:13,181
Is it true?

692
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,547
Leave him be!

693
00:57:16,484 --> 00:57:20,181
Fool! You big fool!

694
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:41,406
Hiroshi!

695
00:58:28,256 --> 00:58:32,460
I was thinking ofSakura's happiness!

696
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,195
Don't meddle!

697
00:58:34,195 --> 00:58:36,264
What? Me meddle?

698
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:40,501
Yes! lfyou hadn't, it would've turned out well!

699
00:58:40,501 --> 00:58:42,670
Fool! It's a laugh!

700
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:45,773
What lout can't even hold hands!

701
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,709
Hiroshi a lout?

702
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:50,979
He's my chiefengineer!

703
00:58:50,979 --> 00:58:54,816
We mayfold up without him!

704
00:58:54,816 --> 00:58:57,385
Good. More sunshine!

705
00:58:57,385 --> 00:58:59,053
Repeat that!

706
00:58:59,053 --> 00:59:04,659
Didn't get me? More sunshine then!

707
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:09,230
You don't know how hard it is
for small enterprises!

708
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:09,998
Pal!

709
00:59:09,998 --> 00:59:11,022
Shut up!

710
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:13,701
Get out!

711
00:59:13,701 --> 00:59:17,405
Yes, that's best!

712
00:59:17,405 --> 00:59:23,177
It wouldn't have happened ifyou
hadn't come back!

713
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:26,314
That does it!

714
00:59:26,314 --> 00:59:29,450
Kicking me out?

715
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:33,755
It's the end ifyou say it!

716
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:37,859
Okay. I'm the odd man here!
I'll never come back!

717
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:39,360
Shut up!

718
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,195
Tothink you'd say it!

719
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:43,663
I'm back

720
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:05,679
Brother. I'm going to marry Hiroshi

721
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:08,756
We're engaged

722
01:00:08,756 --> 01:00:10,725
Boss! Hiroshi's back!

723
01:00:10,725 --> 01:00:12,894
Really?

724
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:16,352
You don't mind? Doyou, Brother?

725
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:32,375
Thanks

726
01:00:58,873 --> 01:01:02,410
Where were you? They're waiting!

727
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:06,147
I know! I know!

728
01:01:06,147 --> 01:01:08,581
I clean forgot my note was due today!

729
01:01:10,618 --> 01:01:15,323
The go-between?

730
01:01:15,323 --> 01:01:18,059
I'm here!

731
01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:21,129
Octopus! Where were you hiding?

732
01:01:21,129 --> 01:01:28,069
Making people worry! Ruining the wedding?

733
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:30,872
It's beginning!

734
01:01:30,872 --> 01:01:33,207
Why're you here? Go away!

735
01:01:33,207 --> 01:01:34,275
First...!

736
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:35,343
What is it?

737
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:39,147
Please introduce both families

738
01:01:39,147 --> 01:01:42,617
Wait. Both families?

739
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:47,588
A mistake? His old man's farming in Hokkaido

740
01:01:47,588 --> 01:01:51,292
After a fiight, he cut offhis ties with him

741
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:54,962
So he wouldn't come

742
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:57,532
A mistake. Let's go

743
01:01:57,532 --> 01:02:00,101
Tora, see him and then...

744
01:02:00,101 --> 01:02:03,264
Say, girl. No, no, a mistake

745
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:21,051
I'm sorry, Mister

746
01:02:22,924 --> 01:02:25,586
Father

747
01:02:30,531 --> 01:02:33,167
I'm his father

748
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,601
I'm his mother

749
01:02:37,705 --> 01:02:41,542
Suwa...Honorary Professor

750
01:02:41,542 --> 01:02:45,646
How doyou read his name?

751
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:48,809
I don't know

752
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:16,978
He didn't want to come

753
01:03:16,978 --> 01:03:20,114
Afiine professor!

754
01:03:20,114 --> 01:03:22,216
A phony?

755
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:24,980
Ready?

756
01:03:30,191 --> 01:03:34,662
I'll take you. Please smile

757
01:03:34,662 --> 01:03:36,323
Butter!

758
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:44,138
I was bad awhile and was expelled from school

759
01:03:44,138 --> 01:03:50,211
He cut me offthen! want no part ofhim!

760
01:03:50,211 --> 01:03:53,047
But he came from Hokkaido?

761
01:03:53,047 --> 01:03:55,379
Just for appearance's sake!

762
01:03:55,516 --> 01:03:57,285
But...

763
01:03:57,285 --> 01:03:58,452
Brother?

764
01:03:58,452 --> 01:04:00,750
Starting pretty soon

765
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:04,258
I understand

766
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:08,696
I knew he lacked manners

767
01:04:08,696 --> 01:04:13,998
Don't worry. Leave it to me. I'll handle it

768
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:24,872
Please applaud!

769
01:04:33,054 --> 01:04:36,691
The groom, Hiroshi...Suwa

770
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:47,301
He was born in lshikari County...the 3rd son...

771
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:51,294
I'm sorry I'm such a poor go-between

772
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:53,698
Stupid octopus!

773
01:05:04,352 --> 01:05:08,756
Hiroshi and Sakura quarreled

774
01:05:08,756 --> 01:05:13,828
Sorry! A mistake

775
01:05:13,828 --> 01:05:18,833
I mean theyfell in love after he had
a big fiight with her brother

776
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:22,036
It started when her brother said

777
01:05:22,036 --> 01:05:28,042
nofactory hand could marry his sister

778
01:05:28,042 --> 01:05:31,910
I didn't!

779
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:51,265
Unlike Torajiro, Sakura was a gentle
and warm-hearted child

780
01:05:51,265 --> 01:05:59,373
She'd go out and crywith him
when he cried, scolded by his father

781
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:02,276
She was like that

782
01:06:02,276 --> 01:06:07,145
On the other hand, Torajiro...

783
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:12,382
You're too slow

784
01:06:53,894 --> 01:06:58,966
That face --- Iaughing at a poor man's wedding!

785
01:06:58,966 --> 01:07:06,240
Ifhe speaks, he'd insult us! Don't let him!

786
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,744
We have to. The groom's father

787
01:07:09,744 --> 01:07:12,113
No, let me talk!

788
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:15,716
I'll tell him what's what!

789
01:07:15,716 --> 01:07:17,752
You against it?

790
01:07:17,752 --> 01:07:21,155
No, no. After his father

791
01:07:21,155 --> 01:07:23,524
I'm last?

792
01:07:23,524 --> 01:07:26,550
Okay, fiine. Forget and I'll bust your head!

793
01:07:29,196 --> 01:07:39,840
It was a very nice wedding

794
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:45,813
And now, a word from
the parents ofthe newlyweds

795
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:52,082
First, Hiroshi's father, Mr. 'K lchiro Suwa

796
01:08:37,298 --> 01:08:43,370
Ordinarily, as the father ofthe groom

797
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:49,343
I should thank you all

798
01:08:49,343 --> 01:08:55,714
But we do not have the right to do so

799
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:05,826
But even parents like us feel like all parents

800
01:09:05,826 --> 01:09:10,831
In all frankness, I saw my son for
the fiirst time in 8 years

801
01:09:10,831 --> 01:09:20,729
Watching him surrounded byyourfriendship

802
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:30,384
and Sakura's gentle love...

803
01:09:30,384 --> 01:09:34,722
I can hardly bearthe shame I feel

804
01:09:34,722 --> 01:09:39,216
What did I dofor my son as a parent?

805
01:09:41,028 --> 01:09:55,967
My guilty conscience tells me
what an inadequate father I was

806
01:09:56,944 --> 01:10:14,488
I know mywife who is beside me
is thinking the same thing

807
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:26,098
These 8 years were a long, long winterto us.

808
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:34,376
But due toyou, spring is coming to us at last

809
01:10:37,618 --> 01:10:43,488
I thank you, everyone

810
01:10:47,294 --> 01:10:50,229
Sakura

811
01:10:50,531 --> 01:10:54,934
Please take care of Hiroshi

812
01:10:55,235 --> 01:11:08,376
Sakura's brother. Please keep an eye
on both ofthem

813
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:14,021
Wait!

814
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:17,391
Father!

815
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:19,985
Mother!

816
01:11:21,295 --> 01:11:25,032
Thank you!

817
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:30,493
I know Hiroshi is very happy!

818
01:11:31,338 --> 01:11:33,533
Thank you!

819
01:11:34,642 --> 01:11:36,701
Sakura!

820
01:11:40,114 --> 01:11:46,053
Sakura, isn't it nice?

821
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:05,963
Thank you! Thank you!

822
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:32,533
I'm back!

823
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,635
Took the sweets tothe temple

824
01:12:34,635 --> 01:12:37,237
Thanks. Was Miss in?

825
01:12:37,237 --> 01:12:41,475
Yes. She said you must be lonelywithout Sakura

826
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:43,110
She's gentle

827
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,778
Pal?

828
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:47,440
He's around?

829
01:12:49,049 --> 01:12:53,454
Pal, Miss said you must be lonelytoo.

830
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:57,991
Joking? Feels nice without that tomboy!

831
01:12:57,991 --> 01:12:59,727
That so?

832
01:12:59,727 --> 01:13:03,390
She said to come over

833
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:26,920
Going out, Uncle

834
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,979
Sure

835
01:13:29,256 --> 01:13:34,228
Not much ofan errand.
Having mywatch repaired

836
01:13:34,228 --> 01:13:37,220
I see. Gothen

837
01:13:37,598 --> 01:13:43,637
Oh, yes, the temple wants their bath fiixed,
so I'll go over

838
01:13:43,637 --> 01:13:45,332
Yes, gothere

839
01:13:46,507 --> 01:13:48,609
Thanks

840
01:13:48,609 --> 01:13:53,013
Why'd you say, Thanks for?

841
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:54,848
Why?

842
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:58,085
Trying to needle me?

843
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:02,456
No. I'm sorry if I upset you. I didn't mean to

844
01:14:02,456 --> 01:14:04,691
Just soyou know

845
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:06,293
Goodbye

846
01:14:06,293 --> 01:14:08,362
Take yourtime

847
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:11,632
Take mytime?

848
01:14:11,632 --> 01:14:16,336
I said I'd be right back!

849
01:14:16,336 --> 01:14:18,605
I've notime to loaf! What doyou mean?

850
01:14:18,605 --> 01:14:20,274
I'm sorry

851
01:14:20,274 --> 01:14:22,943
Now, now, he meant no harm

852
01:14:22,943 --> 01:14:25,279
Noboru apologized

853
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:27,414
Just so he knows

854
01:14:27,414 --> 01:14:28,849
I'm going

855
01:14:28,849 --> 01:14:30,111
Yes, do

856
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:45,799
When she was at home,
I thought Sakura noisy and bossy

857
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:51,872
But the house seems deserted now
that she's gone

858
01:14:51,872 --> 01:14:57,377
I know. Especially since she's your only kin

859
01:14:57,377 --> 01:14:59,746
That's right

860
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,882
You're thinner?

861
01:15:01,882 --> 01:15:06,920
Yes, about 8 pounds

862
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,390
You're pale too

863
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,392
No appetite

864
01:15:12,392 --> 01:15:16,886
That's bad! You'll become sick!

865
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:19,766
All right?

866
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:22,633
I expect so

867
01:15:23,337 --> 01:15:24,972
Who's he?

868
01:15:24,972 --> 01:15:31,545
Listen...let's go and chase awaythe blues

869
01:15:31,545 --> 01:15:34,948
I feel depressed too

870
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:37,712
Let's go

871
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:52,296
Quick! Quick

872
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:54,794
Well done

873
01:15:58,438 --> 01:16:01,742
I'll treat you. I won $D2000

874
01:16:01,742 --> 01:16:03,210
This dump?

875
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:06,304
Never mind

876
01:16:10,484 --> 01:16:15,478
Eat it while it's hot. It's good

877
01:16:19,626 --> 01:16:22,629
Good?

878
01:16:22,629 --> 01:16:24,865
It's good

879
01:16:24,865 --> 01:16:28,201
Sure. Cat's inside

880
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:29,403
No, it isn't!

881
01:16:29,403 --> 01:16:34,739
Fooling her again! Saw you strangle one!
Can't fool me, I know!

882
01:16:58,832 --> 01:17:00,901
Why can't I sing?

883
01:17:00,901 --> 01:17:06,271
Whistling was a childhood friend.
Whistling whenever I chose

884
01:17:08,008 --> 01:17:11,307
Everybody's asleep

885
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:18,552
Shall we goto sleep too?

886
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:20,220
Yes

887
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:24,054
Tora, goodbye

888
01:17:25,559 --> 01:17:27,394
This

889
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:29,089
Thanks

890
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:33,666
Good night

891
01:17:44,144 --> 01:17:46,546
Goodbye!

892
01:17:46,546 --> 01:17:54,421
I could killer her, loving her so

893
01:17:54,421 --> 01:18:01,350
But I nevertouch her, you know

894
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:17,778
Laugh at me a sentimental fool

895
01:18:17,778 --> 01:18:30,123
I'm nowolf, I play it cool

896
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:43,161
It's the rule that I live by...

897
01:19:00,387 --> 01:19:02,252
I'm home

898
01:19:05,859 --> 01:19:10,728
What the... The stair's over here

899
01:19:21,308 --> 01:19:25,369
He's a really a fool

900
01:19:30,484 --> 01:19:34,254
Hot every day, isn't it?

901
01:19:34,254 --> 01:19:37,057
Excuse me. Going fiishing with Miss

902
01:19:37,057 --> 01:19:40,227
Fool! Where are your eyes?

903
01:19:40,227 --> 01:19:41,956
Watch out, dim it!

904
01:19:59,146 --> 01:20:01,648
A guest?

905
01:20:01,648 --> 01:20:07,487
I'm sorry. I promised to gotoday?

906
01:20:07,487 --> 01:20:11,024
It's all right. Please, please

907
01:20:11,024 --> 01:20:15,290
I'm sorry!

908
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:22,502
Going home?

909
01:20:22,502 --> 01:20:25,772
A relative?

910
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:30,937
Yes, he's going to become one

911
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:36,449
Fuyuko's future husband

912
01:20:36,449 --> 01:20:41,755
Had a hard time, but I found a good man

913
01:20:41,755 --> 01:20:44,622
Don't tell anyone yet

914
01:20:54,935 --> 01:21:05,641
I could kill her, loving her so...

915
01:21:20,727 --> 01:21:25,198
Miss, laugh at me

916
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:31,000
I could die, loving you so...

917
01:21:37,644 --> 01:21:41,548
Thank you

918
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:44,084
This one?

919
01:21:44,084 --> 01:21:46,886
You may break it?

920
01:21:46,886 --> 01:21:49,377
Oh sorry!

921
01:22:19,953 --> 01:22:21,154
You're back?

922
01:22:21,154 --> 01:22:22,555
Sakura, when'd you get back?

923
01:22:22,555 --> 01:22:24,491
Late yesterday

924
01:22:24,491 --> 01:22:26,893
I see. A nice honeymoon?

925
01:22:26,893 --> 01:22:29,529
Yes. Thank you for everything

926
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:32,499
No at all. Fine, fiine!

927
01:22:32,499 --> 01:22:35,669
Is Tora back, Noboru?

928
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:40,333
At the temple. He promised Miss

929
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:43,109
It's awful. Sakura!

930
01:22:43,109 --> 01:22:48,240
I saw Miss Fuyuko's groom at the temple

931
01:22:48,415 --> 01:22:50,317
She has one?

932
01:22:50,317 --> 01:22:53,386
University professor. Afiine man

933
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:54,421
So?

934
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:57,891
Tora ran intothem

935
01:22:57,891 --> 01:22:58,825
Oh, no!

936
01:22:58,825 --> 01:23:00,994
Gen told me.

937
01:23:00,994 --> 01:23:02,262
Where is he?

938
01:23:02,262 --> 01:23:07,100
He left, his face pale as a ghost

939
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,102
He won't drown himself?.

940
01:23:09,102 --> 01:23:10,337
Hardly

941
01:23:10,337 --> 01:23:12,405
He will rave tonight. I beg out

942
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:16,239
Awful! Awful!

943
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:22,415
Does he love her so much?

944
01:23:22,415 --> 01:23:24,383
Does he? I'll say. Doesn't he?

945
01:23:26,353 --> 01:23:29,456
Everybody knows he went there
every day afteryourwedding

946
01:23:29,456 --> 01:23:32,425
There's gossip?

947
01:23:32,425 --> 01:23:34,160
Only he didn't knew

948
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:40,734
Miss is so gentle, she didn't mind, I guess

949
01:23:40,734 --> 01:23:43,903
But he was a nuisance

950
01:23:43,903 --> 01:23:46,740
Miss should have told him off!

951
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:49,402
She's to blame too

952
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:55,648
No! It was Tora's mistake tofall in love with her

953
01:23:55,648 --> 01:23:57,384
That's so

954
01:23:57,384 --> 01:23:59,486
He fault, so he can't complain

955
01:23:59,486 --> 01:24:03,855
But it's troublesome

956
01:24:04,023 --> 01:24:09,893
Sakura, get me my pillow. I feel sort oftired

957
01:24:11,798 --> 01:24:16,403
Poor man. I wonderwhat he's doing

958
01:24:16,403 --> 01:24:20,669
What's he doing? He's really a fool

959
01:24:20,974 --> 01:24:23,977
Don't saythat. He's my brother

960
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:27,003
But he's a fool.

961
01:24:34,387 --> 01:24:38,551
You were back?

962
01:24:41,127 --> 01:24:43,118
Yes

963
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,699
What were you doing?

964
01:24:46,699 --> 01:24:48,935
I don't know

965
01:24:48,935 --> 01:24:51,337
Here all along?

966
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:53,897
I heard

967
01:24:55,408 --> 01:24:57,638
Don't laugh!

968
01:25:06,786 --> 01:25:08,686
Boss! Phone!

969
01:25:13,493 --> 01:25:15,586
Say! Phone call!

970
01:25:16,896 --> 01:25:21,162
We got back last night. Thanks a lot

971
01:25:21,468 --> 01:25:25,772
I see. That's fiine. Fine

972
01:25:25,772 --> 01:25:27,535
What's up?

973
01:25:29,242 --> 01:25:30,643
Nothing

974
01:25:30,643 --> 01:25:34,739
What would there be?

975
01:25:45,158 --> 01:25:47,285
Pal

976
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:59,105
I'm in pain

977
01:25:59,105 --> 01:26:01,808
Medicine for my heart

978
01:26:01,808 --> 01:26:04,675
What happened?

979
01:26:18,358 --> 01:26:21,027
Where to?

980
01:26:21,027 --> 01:26:22,929
Atrip

981
01:26:22,929 --> 01:26:24,831
I meant to, anyway

982
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:28,701
Brother, I don't know what to say

983
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:31,761
Never mind

984
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,943
You're really mad?

985
01:26:36,943 --> 01:26:40,743
Forgot it. It's one ofthose things

986
01:26:42,215 --> 01:26:46,379
A lie. you're really angry

987
01:26:52,292 --> 01:26:57,163
You've no place to go!

988
01:26:57,163 --> 01:26:59,996
You're a fool!

989
01:27:02,168 --> 01:27:06,306
Listen, Tora! Really going away?

990
01:27:06,306 --> 01:27:08,035
Pal!

991
01:27:29,128 --> 01:27:31,464
Hachinoe?

992
01:27:31,464 --> 01:27:35,525
Your home's there?

993
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:40,974
So go home. Be a good son

994
01:27:40,974 --> 01:27:44,000
But Pal!

995
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:53,286
Get this, kid. It's about time you
thought ofyour age

996
01:27:53,286 --> 01:27:59,025
Can't even sell stuffand tagging along

997
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:03,896
Everthink how you'll end up?

998
01:28:03,896 --> 01:28:09,969
What'll you do? End up like me?

999
01:28:09,969 --> 01:28:12,772
Yes, I want to be like you

1000
01:28:12,772 --> 01:28:15,842
Fool!

1001
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:20,913
Become a fool like me? You that big a fool?

1002
01:28:20,913 --> 01:28:24,217
Pal! Take me along with you!

1003
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:28,688
Fool! Don't act like a spoiled brat!

1004
01:28:28,688 --> 01:28:36,029
Want the truth? I'm sick and
tired ofyour sugaryface!

1005
01:28:36,029 --> 01:28:38,623
Get lost!

1006
01:28:39,465 --> 01:28:40,566
Get lost, I said!

1007
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:46,004
I will! That suit you?

1008
01:28:58,117 --> 01:29:02,019
What're you gaping at? It's no show!

1009
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:39,624
ONE YEAR LATER

1010
01:29:41,227 --> 01:29:46,032
The baby's smiling. It's smiling at me

1011
01:29:46,032 --> 01:29:50,236
Good baby. Good baby

1012
01:29:50,236 --> 01:29:53,906
Who does he take after?

1013
01:29:53,906 --> 01:29:55,341
Again?

1014
01:29:55,341 --> 01:29:56,943
Never mind!

1015
01:29:56,943 --> 01:29:59,312
How about it?

1016
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:02,315
Well...not exactly like Sakura...

1017
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:05,251
Not like Hiroshi either

1018
01:30:05,251 --> 01:30:07,487
But like someone?

1019
01:30:07,487 --> 01:30:09,155
Stop it, Aunt!

1020
01:30:09,155 --> 01:30:10,757
Whothen?

1021
01:30:10,757 --> 01:30:13,624
It's Tora

1022
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,028
Yes, you're right

1023
01:30:16,028 --> 01:30:19,198
Oh, no!

1024
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:21,868
A card foryour daughter

1025
01:30:21,868 --> 01:30:25,065
I'll send it on to her. Leave it

1026
01:30:26,305 --> 01:30:28,074
Is she well?

1027
01:30:28,074 --> 01:30:33,637
Yes, getting along fiine.
She's plumper, she says

1028
01:30:34,881 --> 01:30:41,343
Now, now, don't cry, Tora. Don't cry!

1029
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:48,795
Dear Mrs. Tsubouchi:
I haven't written toyou a long time.

1030
01:30:48,795 --> 01:30:54,367
It's over a year since I left home.

1031
01:30:54,367 --> 01:31:01,007
Time does fly. I heard my sister has a child
and I am very happy.

1032
01:31:01,007 --> 01:31:08,481
A stupid sister but my only kin,
so pleased be good to her.

1033
01:31:08,481 --> 01:31:13,486
When I think back,
I'm ashamed ofmanythings.

1034
01:31:13,486 --> 01:31:19,492
So I spend my days with Noboru regretting
what I did.

1035
01:31:19,492 --> 01:31:25,055
I beg you toforget them toofrom
the bottom ofmy heart.

1036
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:29,769
Girls, made up pretty,

1037
01:31:29,769 --> 01:31:33,039
A bookstore couldn't paytax 'V a sacrifiice sale!

1038
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:37,109
$D400! $D300! $D200! $D100! How about it?

1039
01:31:37,109 --> 01:31:44,880
You still won't buy? All right then!

1040
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:48,717
I'm desperate! Take your pick!

1041
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:55,194
So desperate I'd bite into
a sun-ripened eggplant!

1042
01:31:55,194 --> 01:31:59,324
But can't with store-bought teeth!
