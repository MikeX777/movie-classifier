1
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:35,602
A violent act, yes.

2
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,500
Act of vengeance, as well.

3
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,710
Act of justice.

4
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:46,002
He was taught to fire quickly
upon any enemy out in the open.

5
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:49,317
He simply did what he had
done thousands of times.

6
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:53,675
Pierre Rouvier was not
the one who fired. No.

7
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:57,669
It was soldier Rouvier,
officer in the paratroopers,

8
00:01:58,213 --> 00:02:01,857
comrade to those who shouted
to the world, "I shall not die in vain."

9
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:05,939
Soldier Pierre Rouvier has earned
the right to our pride

10
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:07,958
and to our affection.

11
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:12,307
And if it is not possible for you
to express our eternal gratitude

12
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,848
to those who shed their blood
so that France might live,

13
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:18,533
may you at least have the solace

14
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:22,908
of easing the burden of one of
their bravest comrades, who was

15
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:26,533
miraculously spared
from the terrifying furnace.

16
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:42,561
I knew right off that
I had them in the palm of my hands.

17
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:46,592
They all but had their handkerchiefs out.
Like at the theater.

18
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:51,153
And it was almost improvised. I didn't
even look at my notes, did you notice?

19
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:53,436
May I ask you a question?

20
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:55,191
Please.

21
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,275
- Haven't you said enough nonsense?
- What?

22
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:00,626
I did kill my wife.

23
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,941
Of course.
Everyone knows that.

24
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,176
I, Pierre Rouvier,
killed my wife, Hélène Rouvier.

25
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:10,780
When she showed up naked, I saw her, not
an enemy soldier. I wanted to shoot <i>her</i>.

26
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:14,795
The paratrooper didn't shoot her.
The cuckold did. See the distinction?

27
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:17,232
That defense would have
never gotten you off.

28
00:03:17,468 --> 00:03:19,357
So what? Did I ask to get off?

29
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:20,521
Goodbye.

30
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:23,729
What did you do? Before...

31
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,893
Law student.
Why?

32
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,302
No reason.

33
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,317
What will you be doing now?

34
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,481
Getting the hell out of here.

35
00:03:56,655 --> 00:04:00,459
THE LOVERS OF THE TEJO

36
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:41,135
<i>Translated for KG by</i> rentboy.

37
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,884
Shot on location in Portugal,
all thanks to the Portuguese authorities.

38
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:11,087
- What's he saying? I couldn't follow.
- He doesn't like folks who travel a lot.

39
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,964
What about Vasco de Gama?

40
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,816
- He still says no? - He says you've
already been in Portugal for too long.

41
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:30,843
I'm not traveling enough now?
They're all the same.

42
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:32,970
Ask him for another 3 months.

43
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,645
Tell him I'm getting out as soon
as a cargo ship comes in.

44
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:24,626
You idiot! Will you get
your cart out the way?

45
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,382
Hell with you.

46
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,653
30 escudos, please.

47
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:04,668
I'm sorry, but I have
no Portuguese money.

48
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:07,298
Wait.

49
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,051
This is much too much.

50
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,662
£ 5, that's...
I don't know, that's...

51
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:15,732
400 escudos. 30 for the ride,
and the rest for the Parisian accent.

52
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,364
Mme Kathleen Dinver.

53
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:34,332
Your suite is ready, Lady Dinver.
Would you please come with me?

54
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,071
Postcard, sir?

55
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:04,316
Hello, Mosquito.

56
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:06,207
Grab a seat.

57
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,492
Well? Are you thirsty?

58
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:11,893
Yeah.

59
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:17,229
- Order up.
- What are you drinking?

60
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,809
- Me too.
- No way.

61
00:11:20,044 --> 00:11:21,752
Grow a mustache first.

62
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,353
That's right.
All of them.

63
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:33,742
How's the postcard business?

64
00:11:33,965 --> 00:11:35,561
Tougher and tougher.

65
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:37,780
Take a look.

66
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,020
They're making their own.

67
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,487
So I sell them stuff
to make cards with.

68
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,952
For a bit more,
I act as their guide.

69
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:49,960
- You have a head for business.
- From my dad, they say.

70
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,840
He was from Marseille. They say
there's nothing better. Is it true?

71
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:57,260
It's true.
Nothing better in Marseille in any case.

72
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,606
Is it true what Manuel says?

73
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:10,768
That a lady paid you £ 5?

74
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,412
Here. Look.

75
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,918
They're in your pocket
like a hanky? Fold them.

76
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:17,657
So many escudos...

77
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,866
It's a lot for you and me,
but maybe not for her.

78
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,330
- The little lady is touched in the head.
- Why?

79
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,811
Maybe it was a good deed by a stranger

80
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,971
hoping for luck in a new land.

81
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,817
And she chose me as a good luck charm?
Poor judgment.

82
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:38,292
- She came from far away?
- From London, I think.

83
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:40,550
She had lots of tags on her bags.

84
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,202
That got to me.

85
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:45,874
Every time I see a tag on a suitcase,
I feel like taking off.

86
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,890
- To go where?
- Dunno. Some other place.

87
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:50,876
Why? Don't you like it here?

88
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,433
I like it fine, Maria.
But I can't help it, my legs are asleep.

89
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:58,423
- I want to travel too.
- Naturally. With a father like yours...

90
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,311
Another one who couldn't sit still.

91
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,202
What a man, that one.

92
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,966
Yeah, right.
He gives you a kid and he runs off.

93
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:08,967
Yes, what a man.

94
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,809
And to top it all,
you admire him.

95
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:13,909
Poor Maria...

96
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,077
Why?

97
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:17,493
He was good to me.

98
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:21,098
He gave me his house for Manuel.
He also gave me happiness.

99
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,708
Otherwise, he was free.
We weren't married.

100
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:24,877
So what?

101
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:26,487
Pierre.

102
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,512
Don't ask providence for too much.

103
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm not asking for anything.

104
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,800
I just want to be left in peace.
I'll take it from there.

105
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,802
But swine can be tamed.

106
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,841
If I was in your place,
I'd have snuffed out your sailor.

107
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,847
Are you talking about my father?

108
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:45,114
Don't play with that, you fool.

109
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,728
You're a good kid, Mosquito.

110
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:53,962
From time to time, stuff comes back
into my head, and I lose my marbles.

111
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:56,529
Peace?

112
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,435
Yes.
Because you're my friend.

113
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,689
And because you're always sad.

114
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,367
- This and this.
- That's ham twice.

115
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,512
Well, give me something else,
whatever you want.

116
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:56,726
She's French, you know.
A compatriot of yours.

117
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:02,296
Poor Lord Dinver. Thinking about it
always spoils my appetite.

118
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,518
I feel even sorrier for her.

119
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:06,817
- Oh? Why?
- I don't know.

120
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:10,481
I think your friend Miguel is
susceptible to young widows.

121
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,890
How interesting.
Did you hear, Sir Oliver?

122
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,808
Note that I too feel
very sorry for her.

123
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:23,299
Well... as sorry as one can be for
a girl her age who's left with

124
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,671
an income of 30 or 40 thousand pounds.

125
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:27,119
That much?

126
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,177
Apparently, she fainted twice
during the funeral.

127
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,100
Well done, I say.

128
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:04,164
Excuse me, Madam.
I speak French, you know?

129
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,595
No, I'm not a beggar.
I'm working.

130
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:09,600
In that case.

131
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,000
- What do you do?
- I'm a guide. Don't you need one?

132
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
- To go to sleep?
- It's not late.

133
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,980
You're already sleepy?

134
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,193
Lisbon by night?

135
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:22,920
Well?

136
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,706
What extraordinary sights
do you suggest?

137
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:27,680
Fado?

138
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:29,487
Do you like fados?

139
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,526
Fados it is.

140
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:19,292
- What did he say?
- We're completely full.

141
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:22,521
If you don't mind waiting,
the first free table is yours.

142
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:25,581
No, it's all right.
I'll come back another day.

143
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:28,130
The lady is with the gentleman.

144
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:30,900
Over there.
He's waiting for her.

145
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:38,345
- Pierre!
- Mosquito.

146
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:40,920
What are you doing here?
You should be in bed.

147
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,810
I'm working as a guide.

148
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,881
That lady with the £ 5?
I'm showing her Lisbon.

149
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,938
I see.  Don't you think she's managed
to find change since this afternoon?

150
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:51,241
You never know.

151
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:54,329
The doorman wouldn't let her in
because it's full.

152
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,181
So I said she was with you.

153
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,389
Are you nuts?
What nerve.

154
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,920
I said I wanted to be alone.
Alone.

155
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,795
You'd stop a poor kid
from making a living?

156
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,847
OK, she can come.

157
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:11,378
But you carry the conversation.
I'm warning you, I'm not talking.

158
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:12,540
Agreed.

159
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:16,573
- Do you like it?
- Very much.

160
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,609
I'm sorry I don't understand Portuguese.
It must be beautiful.

161
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,344
It's the wife of
a fisherman who died at sea.

162
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:26,770
She goes down to the beach every night
and talks to him as if he were alive.

163
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,421
She tells him...

164
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,160
She tells him... love things.

165
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:36,312
I woke up this morning
trembling next to you

166
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:40,112
Afraid that I was
less beautiful than yesterday.

167
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,343
But your eyes told me no.

168
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:45,144
When you opened the door

169
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,326
The sun was gliding
along the sea

170
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:52,053
And your black boat
was dancing in the light.

171
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,863
Standing on the rocks,
I saw you hoist sail

172
00:21:56,721 --> 00:22:00,126
And turn towards the open sea,
while waving happily.

173
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:05,635
The women praying
at night along the shore

174
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,359
Say that you never returned.

175
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:10,946
Madwomen, my love

176
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:12,895
Madwomen.

177
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:15,467
You never left.

178
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:19,825
You're everywhere
around me as always

179
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:26,991
In the wind throwing sand
against the windowpanes

180
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:30,572
In the water singing on the fire

181
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,145
In the empty chair staring at me

182
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,925
In the dark of the hearth

183
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,140
In the warmth of the bed

184
00:22:42,198 --> 00:22:44,218
In the crook of my shoulder

185
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:48,750
You are there always

186
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:51,922
Always

187
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:54,922
Always...

188
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:05,335
Thank you.

189
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:08,246
Not at all.
That came included for the £ 5.

190
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:10,606
A princely tip.

191
00:24:11,772 --> 00:24:15,528
It's not every day one gets to carry
the suitcases of a high end tourist.

192
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,642
Isn't that so, Lady Dinver?

193
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,913
My maiden name is Catherine Clairand.
And my mother was a seamstress.

194
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:23,592
Forgive me.

195
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,777
Do you like Lisbon?

196
00:24:27,937 --> 00:24:29,458
I don't know yet.

197
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,480
Countries are a bit like faces.

198
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,631
They all look different.
Yet they're all alike.

199
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,504
I recognize them by smell.

200
00:24:37,664 --> 00:24:41,943
Take Lisbon, for example. It smells of
algae, rock candy and grilled sardines.

201
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:45,054
Kathleen sweetheart!

202
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:47,450
Not again.

203
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:52,277
You here? What a surprise!

204
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:56,142
They wouldn't let us in
because it's full, but I said that I...

205
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,045
I love these little Portuguese cellars.
They're so louche, don't you think?

206
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:10,365
I had decided to turn in early,
but Miguel insisted on going out.

207
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:12,926
You can only breathe here at night.

208
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:17,164
How do they manage to have a sun
like that in such a tiny country?

209
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:21,178
- You know, it's barely been...
- Yes, of course, you just got here.

210
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:24,819
And as they say in Paris,
you still can't see straight.

211
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:28,995
But you'll see. There are lots of
amusing things to see.

212
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:32,752
- On Augusta Street, for example...
- The taxi you called is here, Madam.

213
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:34,892
- Oh, how sweet.
- Ah, yes...

214
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:36,720
Thanks, I'll be right out.

215
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,185
- Would you excuse me?
- But Kathy darling...

216
00:25:39,345 --> 00:25:40,905
Allow me to take you back.

217
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:43,867
You're very kind
but I don't want to be a bother.

218
00:25:44,027 --> 00:25:46,105
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

219
00:26:03,721 --> 00:26:06,532
I realized they were
bothering you, so...

220
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:11,188
- Are you going back to the hotel now?
- Not much choice.

221
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:14,998
The Avis is the fanciest hotel in town.
Why? Don't you like it?

222
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,510
I do, but I came here to be alone.

223
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,476
- Obviously, that...
- Tell me.

224
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:23,714
Can you think of where I might find a
room or small flat in a quiet neighborhood

225
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,822
far from the high end tourists?

226
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:30,090
- No. In any case, you'd soon tire of it.
- Why? You can show the lady Lisbon.

227
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,886
- You can tell her your stories.
- Stay out of this.

228
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:35,437
He has great stories
of what happened to him...

229
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:37,059
Will you shut up?

230
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:45,415
Don't worry about the flat.
I'll talk to mom.

231
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:19,114
You can come up, Mosquito.

232
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:28,950
Yes?

233
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,268
Good morning, Sr. guide.

234
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:37,768
- Where are we going this morning?
- Augusta Street. Full of fancy shops.

235
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,036
You're starting to know women.

236
00:28:41,082 --> 00:28:44,397
Are you happy going out with me?
I'm not too little for you?

237
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,965
You're a darling kid
and my favorite guide.

238
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,430
And I love visiting Lisbon with you.

239
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:53,320
Do you like Lisbon?

240
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,733
- A lot. Especially when you explain it.
- Of course, it's not Paris or London.

241
00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:00,729
- How do you know?
- Pierre told me.

242
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:04,257
Finally, M. Rouvier. You hadn't
mentioned him since you got here.

243
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:05,792
I was getting worried.

244
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,972
- It bothers you that I talk about him?
- Why would it?

245
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:11,236
We have to talk about something.

246
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:54,271
What is it?

247
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,993
- Triumphal return of the errant armchair.
- Just a minute.

248
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:09,209
- Where do I put it?
- Anywhere.

249
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,661
- Well? Is it holding together now?
- It's holding.

250
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:23,024
It could take a polar bear, and you're
barely larger than a sparrow. Relax.

251
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
How are you?

252
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,077
Brilliant.

253
00:30:29,614 --> 00:30:31,704
OK, well...
I have to go...

254
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,460
See you around.

255
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:36,900
- Wait. What do I owe you for the repair?
- Nothing.

256
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:41,226
I added things up, and with my
lavish income, I still owe you £ 3.

257
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:42,380
Such recall.

258
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:45,441
It looks like I'd better not insist.

259
00:30:47,437 --> 00:30:48,560
Thanks anyway.

260
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,040
Between neighbors...

261
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:53,037
Well, see you around.

262
00:30:53,197 --> 00:30:54,040
Goodbye.

263
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,480
If one day you need anything...

264
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,560
- I go to the window, and I call out.
- That's it.

265
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:10,166
Well, goodbye.

266
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:11,523
Goodbye.

267
00:31:24,544 --> 00:31:25,920
Do you know Nazaré?

268
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:27,996
No, who is it?

269
00:31:28,446 --> 00:31:29,880
It's a fishing village

270
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,823
on the coast of Estremadura.

271
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:36,155
You could say, it's the capital of
sardines. You practically walk on them.

272
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:38,956
At night, the guys pull up nets
like silver carpets.

273
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:41,900
So we're planning to take...
a trip there tomorrow

274
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,399
with a whole gang. Porfirio,
Amália... Porfirio's a friend.

275
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,958
Would you like to come?

276
00:31:47,118 --> 00:31:50,349
You're kind, M. Rouvier, but you know,
group outings and I...

277
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:54,861
I don't know your friends. And I'm a
loner, not at all the group ticket type.

278
00:31:56,642 --> 00:31:58,344
I understand of course.

279
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,028
OK, goodbye.

280
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:01,625
Thanks.

281
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:09,210
What if just the two of us went out?

282
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,834
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are now on the Tejo.

283
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,785
near the river mouth.

284
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:34,183
Lisbon lies along the Tejo...

285
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:41,858
- What did she say?
- She's English. She has a grave concern:

286
00:32:42,018 --> 00:32:44,181
will she find a decent cup of tea?

287
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:48,408
You can't have everything in life:
the Tejo plus a good cup of tea.

288
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,501
Given that you hate crowds,
you must feel right at home.

289
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:54,562
I love crowds, M. Rouvier.

290
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,720
They're blind and deaf.

291
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,587
What could be better?

292
00:33:03,144 --> 00:33:05,813
It's beautiful.
Do you like the Tejo?

293
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:08,979
I like all rivers.
Because they go to the sea.

294
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:13,577
When I'm feeling down,
I stroll along the docks.

295
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:17,189
I smoke a cigarette, and I watch
the water go by. 5 minutes later,

296
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:18,656
I'm in China.

297
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:21,157
You like to travel that much?

298
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:23,634
I like leaving most of all.

299
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:44,664
This reminds me of the <i>bateaux mouches</i>
going down the Seine, minus the guide.

300
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:47,171
- Have you ever been on one?
- Never.

301
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:51,646
Each time one went by, I'd tell myself,
"You'll have to decide someday soon."

302
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:54,363
But they enticed me
far less than the canal boats.

303
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:56,873
How I wanted to ride on a canal boat...

304
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,597
I spent my childhood
watching them go by...

305
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:03,211
I'm sure your father would have paid
for a ride if you had asked him nicely.

306
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:06,077
My father died when I was 5, M. Rouvier.

307
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,611
In any case, he only made
2300 francs a month.

308
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,472
As for my mother,
she was a seamstress.

309
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:15,378
- I told you that the other night.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

310
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:19,409
- I'm spoiling everything. I'm so clumsy.
- You're not spoiling anything.

311
00:34:19,569 --> 00:34:21,496
What about yours?
What did he do?

312
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:23,661
My father was a cabinetmaker.

313
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,967
- We lived on Île Saint-Louis...
- And we, Place St. Michel.

314
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:29,900
- No! So we were neighbors?
- Already.

315
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,782
- I saw the back of Notre-Dame...
- I, the front.

316
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:35,942
And we had to come
to Portugal to notice that.

317
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:03,564
Lady Dinver.

318
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,793
What a happy surprise!
Truly.

319
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,000
Allow me to present my respects.

320
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:11,489
Hello.

321
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:15,362
So you had the idea to
come visit dear old Portugal.

322
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,656
I did too, as you can see.

323
00:35:18,102 --> 00:35:21,174
I must say that
I find you looking much better

324
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:24,723
than the last time
we met in Cornwall, during...

325
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:26,160
I wasn't well.

326
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:30,935
It must also be said that English
weather is much less pleasant,

327
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,360
always full of fog

328
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:35,685
and of ghosts.

329
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:39,160
I apologize for keeping you in
that climate for a while.

330
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:41,886
- Please, forget about it.
- Bravo.

331
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:44,810
I'm happy to see
you don't hold a grudge

332
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,298
for that sad and tragic...

333
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:50,302
- How do you say in French...?
- Oh, I didn't introduce you.

334
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:54,177
- Pierre Rouvier, M. Lewis.
- Very pleased to meet you, M. Rouvier.

335
00:35:54,337 --> 00:35:57,285
I apologize for chattering away like...

336
00:35:57,445 --> 00:35:59,265
an old magpie.
Is that the word?

337
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,959
I'm delaying you.
My respects, Madam.

338
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:04,975
- See you soon.
- Do you plan to stay in Lisbon long?

339
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:07,332
Who knows? Maybe, maybe not.

340
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,991
I'm so stubborn.

341
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:10,654
Goodbye.

342
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,114
A friend of yours?

343
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:29,960
Here we are in front of ancient Nazaré

344
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,011
known for her brocade, her Atlantic ocean
front and her famous schools of sardines

345
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:36,560
brought in at night
by old tired fishermen.

346
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,654
She's also known for her joys,
her customs, her tragedies

347
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:43,860
which make her a destination for
poets, musicians and writers.

348
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:45,900
Follow the guide!

349
00:37:39,275 --> 00:37:41,140
Pierre, what are these women doing?

350
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,486
Praying until the last sail has come in.

351
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:45,804
- The coast is dangerous?
- Terribly.

352
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:50,136
There are no families in Nazaré not
missing a father, brother, or husband.

353
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:52,667
That may be why
girls wear black from birth.

354
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:55,832
- Why do they caress the sand?
- To calm the sea.

355
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,511
Are these your friends?

356
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:19,879
- You don't mind? They're very nice.
- Of course, since they're your friends.

357
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:30,417
I'm a little tired.

358
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,200
I've never known
how to walk on the sand.

359
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:42,300
The trick is not to walk
on it, but in it.

360
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,776
Dig in your feet
as far as they'll go.

361
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:49,836
- In the end, it's less draining.
- You know a lot of things.

362
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:52,504
That one, I learned at Bir Hakeim.

363
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:57,160
This is nice.
I could stay here my whole life.

364
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,436
Not you?

365
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:02,978
Yes and no. Boats in the sand
always get me down.

366
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,104
I only like things that move.

367
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:09,020
Nothing ever ties you down
anywhere, right?

368
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,786
Nothing and no one?

369
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:14,736
And no one has ever tried?

370
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:19,170
That would be going to
a lot of trouble for not much.

371
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:22,230
How can you know that?
Have you been married?

372
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,023
Once and for all.

373
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:28,532
You too, right?

374
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:32,410
You can still see the ring mark
on your finger.

375
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,771
- Are you divorced?
- Widowed.

376
00:41:35,112 --> 00:41:37,599
Must be recent.
The mark is still fresh.

377
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:38,765
A year.

378
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:43,056
- You took off your ring to...
- To avoid pity and questions.

379
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:47,292
Excuse me.

380
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:54,846
Are you angry?

381
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:58,220
No, I'm mad at myself.

382
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:02,146
It's odd, I have
this extraordinary feeling...

383
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:04,500
Can you tell me what it is?

384
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:07,960
You see, Pierre,
we've had at least

385
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:11,330
ten chances to say nasty
things to each other.

386
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:14,611
Well, each time invariably, something...

387
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,420
very strong has kept us together.

388
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:19,603
Perhaps it's misfortune.

389
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:26,660
The unlucky recognize
each other on sight.

390
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,679
No need to wear to sign.

391
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:29,847
Perhaps.

392
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:33,139
It started the first time
we looked at each other,

393
00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:37,033
when I saw you again sitting
alone at that table at Amália's,

394
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:40,371
and then every time
Mosquito would speak of you.

395
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:47,522
Out of all the street noises,
only one wakes me up every time,

396
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:52,151
the sound of your taxi
when you come home at night.

397
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:54,605
The purr of the engine,

398
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,040
the little screech the brake makes,

399
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,403
two squeaks,

400
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,927
the door opening and closing

401
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:03,980
then your steps
on the cobblestones.

402
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,863
And I pass by your house, thinking
you're behind that lit window, and I...

403
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,260
No, Pierre.

404
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:36,567
- Sorry, I should have understood sooner.
- Understood what?

405
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:40,728
Just that deserted beaches, moonlight,
melancholy ladies aren't reason enough

406
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:42,347
to behave like a kid.

407
00:43:42,507 --> 00:43:45,782
A pretty girl lets herself be kissed,
well, she was probably bored.

408
00:43:45,942 --> 00:43:49,547
She wanted to be alone with you,
probably for this melodrama.

409
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,451
Poor fool.

410
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:55,615
Out of all the words you've just said,
only two are true: the last two.

411
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:53,620
- You're coming to dinner tonight, swear?
- Swear.

412
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:57,875
Here.

413
00:45:58,274 --> 00:46:00,282
Take the key.
It's simpler.

414
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:03,748
- Do you insist?
- Yes, I have another.

415
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:08,726
- I don't like keys.
- Why? Have they done something to you?

416
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:09,830
Perhaps.

417
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,854
Silly.

418
00:46:11,014 --> 00:46:14,519
Don't come too late tonight.
I'll be counting the minutes.

419
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:49,307
If you're hell bent on draining
the cellar, you might as well say so.

420
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,949
Leave me the hell alone!

421
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:05,359
I understand getting drunk at night. But
in broad daylight like this, it's vulgar.

422
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,136
Come on, take it easy, Parisian.

423
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,684
Bagaceira doesn't come out of faucets.

424
00:47:21,844 --> 00:47:24,429
In 10 minutes, you'll
be drunk as a skunk.

425
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:25,920
That's why I'm here.

426
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,519
Well, in that case...

427
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,920
Oh, before you fall over,
we need to talk.

428
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,810
- Do you still want to leave?
- What's it to you?

429
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:37,080
It's just that your cargo ship arrives
in 15 days and leaves the next day.

430
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,800
So I'd like to know:
you want to leave or not?

431
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,129
I want to drink.

432
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:46,928
- That's her key?
- Yeah.

433
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:49,253
She gave it to me?

434
00:47:50,272 --> 00:47:51,875
Like the other one.

435
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:55,368
I don't like keys.

436
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,220
Why don't you like keys?

437
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:00,660
Because they open doors.

438
00:48:01,658 --> 00:48:03,784
There are things behind doors...

439
00:48:05,827 --> 00:48:08,786
You open the door and
it hits you right in the face.

440
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:11,827
Then 5 minutes later,
you're a bastard.

441
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,919
You were a good man on one side of the
door. You're a bastard on the other side.

442
00:48:18,387 --> 00:48:19,631
A bastard!

443
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:07,584
Forgive me.

444
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,619
You're really too kind.

445
00:52:10,253 --> 00:52:12,700
Don't you want
to look under the bed.

446
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:16,278
Kathleen, try to understand.

447
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:20,924
Please try to understand me.

448
00:52:22,075 --> 00:52:23,883
I wasn't going to come.

449
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:28,625
- I swore to myself I wouldn't come.
- You swore the opposite to me.

450
00:52:29,532 --> 00:52:32,751
Don't look at me this way. It's...
horrible. It's as if you hate me.

451
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:34,419
I'm measuring you.

452
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,328
Unfortunately, it's a precaution
one always takes too late.

453
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,716
I know what you're going to say.

454
00:52:40,951 --> 00:52:43,368
It's true, I promised
to come for dinner.

455
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:47,041
It's also true I was very happy
at the thought of seeing you again.

456
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:50,393
But I don't know... I started
to think about a bunch of things.

457
00:52:50,553 --> 00:52:53,659
- I told myself...
- You talk to yourself too much.

458
00:52:55,778 --> 00:52:58,678
I don't want it to start again,
you understand?

459
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:01,894
... to start again
like with the other one.

460
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,459
What other one?

461
00:53:05,802 --> 00:53:07,320
The woman I killed.

462
00:53:09,908 --> 00:53:11,014
My wife.

463
00:53:13,845 --> 00:53:15,873
Yes, Kathleen, I'm a murderer.

464
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:19,445
Not a murderer on the run,
don't worry.

465
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,246
Apparently there are distinctions
in killing. There is...

466
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:28,405
the black crime of contract killers,
the red crime of the insane,

467
00:53:28,565 --> 00:53:31,072
the white crime of countries at war...

468
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:35,044
Well, I'm more in the category
of candy pink killers.

469
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:38,020
You see the type?

470
00:53:39,137 --> 00:53:40,946
Acquitted unanimously.

471
00:53:49,966 --> 00:53:51,751
It was a crime of passion?

472
00:53:52,913 --> 00:53:53,914
Yeah...

473
00:53:56,212 --> 00:53:58,032
She was cheating on you?

474
00:53:58,889 --> 00:53:59,896
Yeah.

475
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:04,474
You loved her?

476
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,325
I thought I did.

477
00:54:09,464 --> 00:54:11,295
I always thought I did.

478
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:15,609
But now I know
I killed her for nothing...

479
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:19,518
since you're the one I love.

480
00:54:28,048 --> 00:54:29,468
You told yourself...

481
00:54:29,628 --> 00:54:33,144
She'll be like the other one.
She has to be like the other one.

482
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:36,515
- And everything will start again.
- Yes, that's it.

483
00:54:36,675 --> 00:54:38,477
Nothing ever starts again.

484
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:41,166
There aren't...

485
00:54:41,389 --> 00:54:42,798
two drops of water,

486
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:44,571
There are no two women

487
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:46,133
no two men

488
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,568
no two loves
that are alike.

489
00:54:49,508 --> 00:54:51,516
I might hurt you too, but...

490
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:53,948
not that way.

491
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:56,283
You love me?

492
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,942
Go ask the beach in Nazaré.

493
00:54:59,224 --> 00:55:01,231
I want to know if you love me.

494
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:03,747
And I don't want to know.

495
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,777
I can tell you that...

496
00:55:05,937 --> 00:55:08,937
when you're not there,
I'm like an empty house.

497
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:12,355
And when you come back,
even breaking down doors...

498
00:55:12,515 --> 00:55:15,973
it's as if the sun were
shining in my face again.

499
00:55:16,325 --> 00:55:18,227
No, don't say anything.

500
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,822
Be quiet.

501
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,353
Leave it, don't answer.

502
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:35,772
- Who can it be?
- Who gives a damn?

503
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:39,062
No one knows my number in Lisbon,
except for you and Maria.

504
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:42,727
And Maria doesn't have a phone.
It might be a wrong number.

505
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:46,464
Who's calling?

506
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:51,934
They must have hung up.

507
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:54,903
No, there's someone there,
I'm sure of it.

508
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:57,451
Who's there?

509
00:56:22,757 --> 00:56:24,519
This time, he hung up.

510
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:28,969
Do you know who it was?

511
00:56:29,629 --> 00:56:30,674
That...

512
00:56:31,237 --> 00:56:32,541
that's Lewis.

513
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,717
He's your lover?

514
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:41,432
- My poor Pierre...
- Is he your lover?

515
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,003
He was?

516
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:46,269
Then who is he?

517
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:50,429
He's a chief inspector at Scotland Yard.

518
00:56:51,556 --> 00:56:52,589
A cop?

519
00:56:53,106 --> 00:56:55,114
What does he want with you?

520
00:57:02,162 --> 00:57:04,192
My husband died in a car accident.

521
00:57:04,352 --> 00:57:05,600
That's his business?

522
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:08,400
An accident is an accident,
even in England.

523
00:57:09,938 --> 00:57:12,367
The coroner ruled accidental death,

524
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:15,420
but Lewis has never wanted
to believe that version.

525
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,880
More precisely, he has been paid
not to believe that version.

526
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:22,080
- By whom?
- By the Dinvers, my husband's family.

527
00:57:23,287 --> 00:57:24,906
They've always hated me.

528
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,001
To them, I was the intruder,

529
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:29,938
the kid from Paris,
who became Lady Dinver.

530
00:57:30,524 --> 00:57:32,754
And now, I've become the heiress.

531
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:35,164
It's a real blow, you understand?

532
00:57:35,324 --> 00:57:38,829
Fortunately, I was 30 Kms away
when the accident happened.

533
00:57:39,286 --> 00:57:41,024
Bill was driving alone.

534
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:43,490
Bill was your husband?

535
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:46,680
You called him Bill?

536
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,800
Everyone called him Bill.

537
00:57:50,128 --> 00:57:53,040
But that Lewis, what is he hoping for,
following you around?

538
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,212
What is he waiting for?

539
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:57,220
He's waiting.

540
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:01,127
You've never seen a cat
watching a bird in a tree?

541
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:05,742
The bird hasn't done anything,
but the cat still waits.

542
00:58:08,548 --> 00:58:10,802
But your husband, your Bill...

543
00:58:12,426 --> 00:58:13,929
was he like them?

544
00:58:16,312 --> 00:58:19,130
Don't you want to talk
about something else?

545
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:33,540
Well, M. Lewis,

546
00:59:34,573 --> 00:59:36,275
what exactly do you want?

547
00:59:36,435 --> 00:59:39,608
I'm thrilled that you
remembered my name, M. Rouvier.

548
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,692
I want to go to King George's Bar,
quite simply.

549
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:46,761
Listen to me, Lewis.

550
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:49,927
I'm not as much of an idiot
as you seem to think.

551
00:59:50,444 --> 00:59:52,745
You didn't choose my taxi by chance.

552
00:59:53,124 --> 00:59:56,199
I was 10th in line, and
you came straight to me. Why?

553
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,796
Because you have an
enormously likable face.

554
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,080
I'm glad to hear it.

555
01:00:02,754 --> 01:00:04,925
So, did you have
something to tell me?

556
01:00:05,085 --> 01:00:07,794
I'd like nothing more than to please you.

557
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:10,718
What's your pleasure?

558
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,467
Would you like us
to talk about Lady Dinver?

559
01:00:13,627 --> 01:00:15,793
Yes, but I'll do the talking.

560
01:00:16,436 --> 01:00:17,840
Leave her alone, clear?

561
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,925
Clear.

562
01:00:19,608 --> 01:00:22,156
You don't like knowing, that's all.

563
01:00:23,283 --> 01:00:24,283
Too bad.

564
01:00:25,165 --> 01:00:29,400
You're foolishly depriving yourself of
one of life's great pleasures:

565
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,878
the discovery of a human being.

566
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,760
Pack up your literature textbook.
I'm not buying.

567
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:38,015
"Where are you, certainty?"
Othello cried.

568
01:00:39,142 --> 01:00:41,150
But you are not Othello.

569
01:00:42,265 --> 01:00:43,866
No, I'm a taxi driver.

570
01:00:44,026 --> 01:00:45,540
And I say to you...

571
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,575
Emotions aside,
how much do I owe you?

572
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:54,700
7 escudos.

573
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:57,307
You want a receipt
for the Dinver family?

574
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:58,474
Oh, boy...

575
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:01,003
She's told you a lot about me.

576
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,834
No receipt, thanks.

577
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:05,500
I negotiated a fixed price.
See you soon.

578
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:14,092
You can keep your tip.

579
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,240
I never accept any from cops.

580
01:01:51,372 --> 01:01:52,440
Excuse me.

581
01:01:54,871 --> 01:01:56,879
You forgot this on the seat.

582
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,876
I never forget anything, M. Rouvier.

583
01:02:01,024 --> 01:02:03,753
I thought you'd want to see me again.

584
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:05,277
So...

585
01:02:06,009 --> 01:02:08,334
I gave you... a pretext.

586
01:02:09,144 --> 01:02:11,520
- Subtle, no?
- You want applause?

587
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,887
You came.
That's the important thing.

588
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:16,568
Go on, take a seat.

589
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,716
Another 2 scotch.

590
01:02:19,876 --> 01:02:23,119
I came back, but not to listen
to your drivel about Kathleen.

591
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:26,107
I came back to dot the i's
and cross the t's.

592
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:28,361
See what I mean?

593
01:02:28,521 --> 01:02:30,041
Yes, very funny.

594
01:02:30,522 --> 01:02:33,223
I wouldn't want you
to take me for a fool.

595
01:02:33,602 --> 01:02:36,901
I might as well warn you
Kathleen told me everything.

596
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,709
I know.

597
01:02:38,979 --> 01:02:40,987
You know what she told you.

598
01:02:41,574 --> 01:02:42,580
I do too.

599
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:44,531
You too what?

600
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,161
I too know what she told you.

601
01:02:48,288 --> 01:02:49,791
I have a good idea.

602
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:51,966
First, the marriage.

603
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,805
The lord marries
the perfume salesgirl.

604
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:56,839
Very sweet.

605
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,238
Then, England.

606
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,901
The lord's family takes to
hating this second-hand Lady.

607
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:04,453
Very sad.

608
01:03:05,296 --> 01:03:06,940
Then the car accident.

609
01:03:07,365 --> 01:03:09,972
The Lady is widowed,
and she inherits.

610
01:03:10,676 --> 01:03:14,077
So the Dinver family sics
on her heels a Yard policeman.

611
01:03:14,563 --> 01:03:15,620
Very nasty.

612
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:18,900
Correct, M. Rouvier?

613
01:03:19,464 --> 01:03:20,356
Correct,

614
01:03:20,556 --> 01:03:21,566
copper.

615
01:03:22,481 --> 01:03:25,753
But do you know she was 30 Kms away
when the accident happened?

616
01:03:25,913 --> 01:03:27,216
- 35.
- Well?

617
01:03:27,521 --> 01:03:29,517
Well, it's true, M. Rouvier.

618
01:03:29,677 --> 01:03:32,173
So why the hell are you here
poisoning her life?

619
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,710
- Because of the holes?
- The holes?

620
01:03:35,074 --> 01:03:36,680
I don't like holes.

621
01:03:37,203 --> 01:03:39,211
Everything she said is true.

622
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:42,604
But there is also
what she hasn't said

623
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:45,058
and which is equally true.

624
01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:48,876
If by any chance
that little problem interests you,

625
01:03:49,036 --> 01:03:51,267
I am at your complete disposal.

626
01:03:54,616 --> 01:03:56,389
You're a bastard, Lewis.

627
01:03:57,974 --> 01:04:01,789
M. Rouvier, a cop is
always a career bastard.

628
01:04:05,002 --> 01:04:06,762
You won't have her, Lewis.

629
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:08,923
Get this through your head.

630
01:04:09,757 --> 01:04:14,619
- Because I will do everything it takes.
- In fact, you're the only one who can.

631
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,930
I think our conversation is
taking a regrettable turn.

632
01:04:36,963 --> 01:04:39,128
Compared to you,
I'm 10 thousand years old.

633
01:04:39,288 --> 01:04:41,888
You barely look them.
At worst 5, or 6.

634
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,448
It's because I'm happy.

635
01:04:47,488 --> 01:04:50,968
Now, I'll ask you a crucial question
that will decide my whole future.

636
01:04:51,128 --> 01:04:53,457
How do you say <i>lemonade</i> in Portuguese?

637
01:04:53,617 --> 01:04:56,246
- Pirolito. Why? You want some?
- A tankerful.

638
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:58,507
Don't move, I'll be right back.

639
01:05:07,444 --> 01:05:09,771
What's happened to you all this time?

640
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:12,814
You vanished from the hotel
with no warning. Horrible.

641
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:15,676
- Yes, I...
- Miguel thought you had left Lisbon.

642
01:05:15,836 --> 01:05:19,211
But I was sure of the opposite.
I have antennae, I do.

643
01:05:19,371 --> 01:05:20,871
Am I not right?

644
01:05:21,177 --> 01:05:25,297
We barely had the pleasure of
meeting you before you vanished like...

645
01:05:25,457 --> 01:05:27,620
like the sun behind a cloud.

646
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,220
Miguel, how terribly poetic of you.

647
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:39,411
Allow me to introduce
Mrs. Maisie Dixon from London,

648
01:05:39,571 --> 01:05:43,310
- Sr. Miguel Acevera - How do you do?
- Pierre Rouvier, my cloud.

649
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:46,938
I'll explain later. I'm thirsty now.

650
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:50,814
- Would you like to take advantage?
- No, thanks. - You?

651
01:05:50,974 --> 01:05:52,012
It's good.

652
01:05:52,172 --> 01:05:54,862
- Excuse me. - What if he's thirsty?
- He's not thirsty.

653
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:57,762
In any case, we must leave right away.
Goodbye, dear.

654
01:05:57,922 --> 01:05:59,759
And have fun, children.

655
01:06:00,112 --> 01:06:02,266
Women are impossible to understand.

656
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:05,894
What's the matter?

657
01:06:07,023 --> 01:06:10,497
I don't understand English very well,
but I think she's right.

658
01:06:10,657 --> 01:06:13,808
- She's a nutter.
- She's still right. I'm not a gentleman.

659
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:17,331
Not as she means it, but I think
you're great as you are.

660
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:18,821
Are you sure?

661
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:42,454
Are you sleeping?

662
01:06:44,074 --> 01:06:46,082
I'm too hot, and too thirsty.

663
01:06:53,306 --> 01:06:56,106
Would you like me
to get you some cold water.

664
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,439
Wait.

665
01:07:05,731 --> 01:07:07,938
I've never seen heat like this.

666
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,539
In Paris at least, I had the option of
walking along the docks until 1am.

667
01:07:14,173 --> 01:07:17,448
If you could only see me
crawl into work the next day.

668
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,629
Is it hard to sell perfume?

669
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:22,225
How do you know I sold perfume?

670
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,588
Because you told me, obviously.

671
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:26,750
I don't remember telling you.

672
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,072
- Did you work far from home?
- Champs-Elysées.

673
01:07:36,315 --> 01:07:37,888
Fancy neighborhood.

674
01:07:38,314 --> 01:07:41,020
You must have seen
plenty of high society.

675
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:43,985
Apparently, that's how you met him.

676
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,021
- Who?
- Lord Dinver.

677
01:07:47,513 --> 01:07:49,016
The famous Bill.

678
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:54,320
What, no answer?

679
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,921
I don't like folks
going through my drawers.

680
01:07:57,081 --> 01:07:59,565
Or folks laying traps
while acting innocent.

681
01:07:59,725 --> 01:08:03,195
What happened before you
doesn't concern you. None of it.

682
01:08:03,431 --> 01:08:04,785
Is that a demand?

683
01:08:04,945 --> 01:08:07,262
Please don't bare your fangs.

684
01:08:07,422 --> 01:08:10,491
From the sands of Nazaré
through this glass of water,

685
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,922
every minute of my life
belongs to you,

686
01:08:13,082 --> 01:08:15,764
but not the ones before.
Those are mine.

687
01:08:19,577 --> 01:08:20,586
Yeah...

688
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:24,301
You must be loved blindly, of course.

689
01:08:24,461 --> 01:08:27,766
If you wish. And you must
take me as I am or leave me.

690
01:08:27,926 --> 01:08:30,717
I know nothing of your life.
I've told you all about mine.

691
01:08:30,877 --> 01:08:34,684
I didn't ask you anything.
I would have never asked you anything.

692
01:08:41,477 --> 01:08:42,581
Kiss me.

693
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:53,851
Over here, M. Rouvier.

694
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:56,869
Please take a seat.

695
01:09:59,593 --> 01:10:02,188
Above all, relax.

696
01:10:03,304 --> 01:10:04,807
Breathe deeply.

697
01:10:05,511 --> 01:10:08,529
You have to get your lungs
quickly accustomed to the steam

698
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,229
if you want to avoid feeling nauseated.

699
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:13,049
I already am.

700
01:10:15,995 --> 01:10:18,003
Is something bothering you?

701
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:20,339
You.

702
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:24,495
The worst thing in life
is to need people like you.

703
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,665
But you don't need me.

704
01:10:28,864 --> 01:10:32,469
I imagine Lady Dinver has already
given you a lot of herself.

705
01:10:33,561 --> 01:10:36,168
Why don't you try
to be happy with that?

706
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:40,097
That way lies happiness perhaps.

707
01:10:43,446 --> 01:10:45,982
Officially, I come off like a brute.

708
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:50,104
Officially, Lady Dinver
is entitled to every compassion.

709
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:54,849
When you suddenly lose
such an extraordinary husband...

710
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:58,571
What was so extraordinary about the guy?
Did he have wings?

711
01:10:59,184 --> 01:11:01,192
Let's just say he rated...

712
01:11:01,873 --> 01:11:03,881
far above the average man.

713
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:06,837
Far above you...

714
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:08,997
and me, for example.

715
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:11,733
Thanks, I feel less alone.

716
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:14,590
First, he was handsome.

717
01:11:15,435 --> 01:11:19,028
You're not ugly, M. Rouvier,
but Lord Dinver was handsome.

718
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,918
See the distinction?

719
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:24,530
He was also rich, generous...

720
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:26,866
kindhearted, cultivated...

721
01:11:27,207 --> 01:11:29,520
- witty...
- All right, enough.

722
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:33,571
She must have loved him very much.

723
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:36,141
Put yourself in her shoes.

724
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:40,003
So why do you insist on suspecting her?
That makes no sense.

725
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:44,149
- Do people kill those they love?
- Allow me to turn the question around.

726
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:48,240
Do people kill those they love,
M. Rouvier?

727
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:54,266
- You know about that, too?
- Yet I'm the least curious man on earth.

728
01:11:55,584 --> 01:11:58,555
For 23 years, I've lived
in the same building

729
01:11:59,025 --> 01:12:02,712
and I'd be at a loss to tell you
the names of my neighbors.

730
01:12:15,263 --> 01:12:17,717
Lady Dinver's exemplary grief

731
01:12:18,645 --> 01:12:20,653
was admired by all London.

732
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,620
No one had ever seen
such beautiful eyes shed so many tears.

733
01:12:27,434 --> 01:12:29,898
You'll understand
under these circumstances

734
01:12:30,058 --> 01:12:34,519
how I might be surprised that such
great pain could vanish so quickly

735
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:36,239
in your arms.

736
01:12:38,226 --> 01:12:41,502
Your anesthetic powers
are quite remarkable.

737
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:45,660
Kathleen is 24, a widow for a year.
Isn't that enough for you?

738
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,338
Bill Dinver died... barely...

739
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:50,933
11 weeks ago, my friend.

740
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:52,950
74 days, exactly.

741
01:12:54,388 --> 01:12:55,796
2 and a half months.

742
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:57,359
You're lying.

743
01:12:57,655 --> 01:13:01,780
Would you like to check the newspapers?
I have them here.

744
01:13:04,136 --> 01:13:06,144
So... you were lied to.

745
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,454
There's one major
question mark for you.

746
01:13:13,297 --> 01:13:14,401
Isn't it?

747
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:18,120
I can offer you three answers.

748
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:22,541
Either Lady Dinver pretended
to love her husband,

749
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:26,155
or you're the one
she's pretending to love,

750
01:13:26,977 --> 01:13:29,630
or she pretended to love both.

751
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,556
- Why?
- Why not?

752
01:13:32,335 --> 01:13:34,754
She needed Bill Dinver to be rich.

753
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,938
Then she needed you...

754
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:40,272
let's say, to be... less alone.

755
01:13:40,812 --> 01:13:43,534
- Even if true, that's my business.
- Sorry, but

756
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:47,563
I'm paid -- rather badly by the way --
to clear up mysteries.

757
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:50,783
And Bill Dinver's death is one.

758
01:13:51,738 --> 01:13:55,510
There had to be an inquest. Kathleen's
innocence must have been proven, no?

759
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:59,959
It was not possible to prove her guilt.
There's a distinction.

760
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:04,312
Come on, the guy died in a car accident.
That's happened before, no?

761
01:14:04,737 --> 01:14:08,140
What would you think of a woman
who lets you get in a car

762
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,616
knowing perfectly well that you have
every chance of getting into a crash?

763
01:14:13,497 --> 01:14:14,520
Prove it.

764
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,069
I have no proof, and I never will.

765
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,120
So why the hell are you still here?

766
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:26,060
A good bridge player never throws out
his cards before playing them all.

767
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,320
I still have one left...

768
01:14:29,115 --> 01:14:30,571
a very small one.

769
01:14:31,405 --> 01:14:32,437
Which one?

770
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:35,550
If I told you,
where would the surprise be?

771
01:14:40,233 --> 01:14:42,041
Don't go out like that.

772
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:44,671
You'll catch cold, M. Rouvier.

773
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,858
Well, well, Parisian,

774
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,981
your cargo ship finally came in

775
01:15:24,141 --> 01:15:26,741
with a captain made to order for you.

776
01:15:27,692 --> 01:15:30,581
And he's from your country.
Everything OK?

777
01:15:32,614 --> 01:15:33,894
By the way...

778
01:15:34,094 --> 01:15:37,088
She's fueling up today.
And tomorrow at dawn...

779
01:15:44,363 --> 01:15:46,571
- And what's this?
- Show me.

780
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:51,980
That's the small hotel where I lived.
I shared a room with a girlfriend.

781
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,400
Here she is.

782
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,950
Not as pretty as you.

783
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:58,750
- You say that about every woman you see.
- Because it's true.

784
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:01,386
- And that?
- That is a church

785
01:16:01,546 --> 01:16:03,800
in Paris.
St. Germain-of-the-Prairies.

786
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,400
- I don't see any cows.
- Cows?

787
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,360
There are cows in prairies, no?

788
01:16:08,745 --> 01:16:11,326
Not there.
There are no prairies either.

789
01:16:11,486 --> 01:16:13,671
So those people with
beards and long hair

790
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:15,320
aren't keeping cows?

791
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:17,922
No, they live in the neighborhood.

792
01:16:18,082 --> 01:16:21,684
There are painters, sculptors,
writers, philosophers...

793
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:23,180
Like these?

794
01:16:25,908 --> 01:16:27,141
Here's Pierre.

795
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:30,792
- Hello, Pierre.
- Hello.

796
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:33,527
- What's the matter?
- Nothing at all.

797
01:16:33,687 --> 01:16:35,814
Something is.
I'm starting to know you.

798
01:16:35,974 --> 01:16:36,978
Oh yeah?

799
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:39,985
We're starting to know each other then.
That's it.

800
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:42,813
- Did you see the photos?
- He's not interested.

801
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:44,379
Sure, why not.

802
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:47,519
It's good sometime
to go down memory lane.

803
01:16:49,154 --> 01:16:50,760
First class establishment

804
01:16:51,082 --> 01:16:55,788
and the famous stools on which the future
Lady Dinver will meet her prince charming.

805
01:16:57,188 --> 01:16:59,314
What does a prince charming do?

806
01:16:59,513 --> 01:17:02,073
He changes the fate of shepherdesses.

807
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:06,851
He looks like a god, with pockets full
of money, and holes in those pockets.

808
01:17:07,011 --> 01:17:10,617
And the shepherdess only has to
stoop to fill hers up, you understand?

809
01:17:10,777 --> 01:17:13,980
- You will soon enough, no hurry.
- Pierre, what's the matter?

810
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:18,200
- I'm kidding. I have the right, no?
- As long as you're funny.

811
01:17:18,772 --> 01:17:21,520
He was funnier than I am?
A thousand apologies.

812
01:17:22,116 --> 01:17:24,159
It's the prince's castle.

813
01:17:25,603 --> 01:17:30,020
And the noble family lined up before the
front steps... welcomes the shepherdess.

814
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,252
Historic moment.

815
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,263
Some long faces, but
they still welcome her.

816
01:17:35,423 --> 01:17:39,761
Prince charming isn't there, though.
He's probably the one taking the picture.

817
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,929
Poor prince.

818
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:45,566
- Why? Did something happen to him?
- Kinda.

819
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:48,330
- Did he fall from his horse?
- That's it.

820
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,260
He fell from his 30 horsepower V8.

821
01:17:51,897 --> 01:17:53,575
Leave us alone, my dear.

822
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:56,194
- I have to go already?
- Do it for me.

823
01:17:56,354 --> 01:17:58,590
- Can I come back?
- Of course.

824
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,280
You can continue now.

825
01:18:08,573 --> 01:18:10,310
- I'm done.
- Come on now.

826
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,882
Tell me at least where you met him.

827
01:18:13,249 --> 01:18:15,209
- Who?
- Your friend Lewis.

828
01:18:15,369 --> 01:18:18,555
You're just itching to see
that cop undressed in front of you.

829
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:22,613
Scotland Yard strip-tease in the
presence of M. Rouvier the connoisseur.

830
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:25,890
I hope he gave you
the Dinver money's worth.

831
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,543
I wanted to know.

832
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:31,400
- I absolutely had to know.
- So you know now?

833
01:18:33,103 --> 01:18:34,561
I know you lied to me.

834
01:18:34,721 --> 01:18:36,453
- Lewis or I?
- You.

835
01:18:37,721 --> 01:18:39,400
About your husband.

836
01:18:41,798 --> 01:18:44,600
How could I have lied to you?
I've never spoken of him.

837
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,971
Sometimes being quiet
is the ugliest kind of lie.

838
01:18:48,772 --> 01:18:51,379
I'm paid and I've paid to know that.

839
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:54,933
The kind of woman you are, the kind
of woman you were for Lord Dinver...

840
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:56,201
His wife.

841
01:18:59,383 --> 01:19:01,835
- You loved him, eh?
- I was his wife.

842
01:19:01,995 --> 01:19:04,580
I don't ask you
what you did with yours.

843
01:19:04,802 --> 01:19:06,070
Is that all?

844
01:19:06,924 --> 01:19:09,641
Let's talk about your
so-called year of mourning,

845
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:12,329
Your husband died barely
2 and a half months ago.

846
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:15,896
- Why did you tell me a year?
- I judged it more proper.

847
01:19:16,517 --> 01:19:19,100
Deep down, you're so petit bourgeois.

848
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:22,457
Do you want to read the transcript
of the coroner's report?

849
01:19:22,617 --> 01:19:24,783
- I have a copy.
- I don't want that!

850
01:19:24,943 --> 01:19:28,845
- If it's necessary to divulge one's police
record to become your mistress - Stop it.

851
01:19:29,005 --> 01:19:30,820
Then what? What is it you want?

852
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:33,965
To be the pawn of a crooked cop
whose only hope is to break us up?

853
01:19:34,125 --> 01:19:37,969
To spoil my happiness, to hurt me,
to make things impossible between us?

854
01:19:38,129 --> 01:19:41,058
- I'm miserable, Kathleen.
- By your down doing.

855
01:19:43,174 --> 01:19:44,600
Please forgive me.

856
01:19:45,044 --> 01:19:49,024
You mustn't ask too often, Pierre.
I'm not that generous. Be careful.

857
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,768
- Your wife always... -

858
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:23,522
I don't like your eyes.

859
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:25,612
What is it now?

860
01:20:26,293 --> 01:20:27,300
Say it.

861
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,603
Go on, say it.

862
01:20:28,763 --> 01:20:32,312
How often did you kiss him like that before
he realized you were laughing at him?

863
01:20:33,754 --> 01:20:34,755
Go.

864
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:36,445
Go.

865
01:20:38,894 --> 01:20:40,104
I'm going.

866
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,975
But further than you think. A cargo ship
leaves tomorrow. I'll be on it.

867
01:20:44,135 --> 01:20:45,852
I'm done with your lies

868
01:20:46,012 --> 01:20:48,212
and your silences
that are also lies.

869
01:20:48,372 --> 01:20:50,875
I leave you all alone
with your past.

870
01:20:52,255 --> 01:20:54,756
Here. Just give it to the next one.

871
01:21:11,456 --> 01:21:12,459
I am.

872
01:21:14,897 --> 01:21:16,904
I don't understand Portuguese.

873
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:21,534
You must come to the precinct...
today...

874
01:21:22,109 --> 01:21:23,811
with your passport.

875
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:52,064
What happened?

876
01:21:52,651 --> 01:21:55,023
What happened?
My cargo ship is here.

877
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:58,091
I've been waiting for it for 2 months.

878
01:21:58,251 --> 01:21:59,721
I didn't talk about it?

879
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:04,090
You stopped talking about it weeks ago.
I thought you had changed your mind.

880
01:22:04,701 --> 01:22:06,203
Is it because of her?

881
01:22:06,363 --> 01:22:08,924
Her? Who's that?
I don't know a "her."

882
01:22:09,084 --> 01:22:12,606
You're going to hurt her an awful lot.
She had only you.

883
01:22:13,235 --> 01:22:15,313
You're right, she really had me.

884
01:22:15,971 --> 01:22:19,173
But don't worry.
I'm neither the first nor the last.

885
01:22:20,538 --> 01:22:22,029
She'll have others.

886
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:24,255
She's too good a kisser.

887
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,198
Is it true you're leaving?

888
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:47,346
Tell me.

889
01:22:47,506 --> 01:22:50,560
Well, yeah.
You knew I'd be leaving sooner or later.

890
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,505
It's a good thing I was here.

891
01:22:52,665 --> 01:22:55,890
I was planning to come say goodbye
tonight before I left. Word of honor.

892
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,556
Are you going far?

893
01:22:59,669 --> 01:23:01,853
You'll never come back to Lisbon?

894
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:05,153
I might someday,
but not for a long time.

895
01:23:06,268 --> 01:23:09,068
You're not crying, are you?
Listen, Mosquito.

896
01:23:09,228 --> 01:23:11,007
The two of us are friends.

897
01:23:11,335 --> 01:23:12,474
We're men.

898
01:23:14,626 --> 01:23:16,631
Well, men must never cry.

899
01:23:17,268 --> 01:23:19,180
Wet handkerchiefs are for girls.

900
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:20,836
I'm not crying.

901
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,140
Let's see.

902
01:23:22,584 --> 01:23:24,800
Shake my hand, and say goodbye.

903
01:23:26,056 --> 01:23:28,585
- Goodbye, Pierre.
- You can do better.

904
01:23:28,745 --> 01:23:30,140
Goodbye, Parisian.

905
01:23:30,612 --> 01:23:32,212
Well now you're a man.

906
01:23:33,656 --> 01:23:35,171
Goodbye, Mosquito.

907
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:25,360
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,
Lady Dinver.

908
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,400
But resident aliens are required to
sign a change of address form.

909
01:24:29,764 --> 01:24:32,642
You neglected to do so
when you left the hotel Avis.

910
01:24:32,802 --> 01:24:33,816
Sit down.

911
01:24:33,976 --> 01:24:36,772
- I didn't know.
- Oh, it's not very important.

912
01:24:36,932 --> 01:24:38,699
It's just a formality.

913
01:24:39,348 --> 01:24:42,248
If you would let me
have your passport...

914
01:24:43,586 --> 01:24:45,822
It will be ready in 2 days, on Monday.

915
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:49,188
No need to come here again.
I'll have it delivered.

916
01:24:49,686 --> 01:24:51,714
- Monday?
- Yes, Monday.

917
01:24:52,178 --> 01:24:54,515
You need 2 days to stamp a passport?

918
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,080
It's just...

919
01:24:56,358 --> 01:24:58,760
the person who handles
changes of address

920
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,585
is not here right now.

921
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,000
Do you mean Mr. Lewis?

922
01:25:06,605 --> 01:25:08,413
I don't understand. I...

923
01:25:08,816 --> 01:25:10,119
We don't know...

924
01:25:10,389 --> 01:25:12,983
any inspector here
by the name of Lewis.

925
01:25:13,143 --> 01:25:16,059
- I... I assure you...
- How do you know he's an inspector?

926
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:18,644
- I said, Mr. Lewis.
- I don't think I...

927
01:25:18,804 --> 01:25:21,484
Since you're taking orders
from Scotland Yard

928
01:25:21,644 --> 01:25:25,651
you'll allow me to seek counsel at
the British consulate in Lisbon.

929
01:25:26,152 --> 01:25:30,262
We'll see if you're allowed to
deprive me of my passport for 48 hours.

930
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,322
What do you think, Inspector Lewis?

931
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:39,013
I think you're a remarkably
intelligent woman.

932
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,721
You're completely right.

933
01:25:44,856 --> 01:25:48,884
More precisely, you'll be completely
right starting Monday morning.

934
01:25:49,705 --> 01:25:52,218
Until then, the consulate is closed.

935
01:25:53,054 --> 01:25:57,058
As soon as it opens, I'll simply
need to return your passport,

936
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:01,844
to offer you my apologies for
the unfortunate misunderstanding,

937
01:26:02,004 --> 01:26:04,456
and to withstand, respectfully,

938
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,177
a dressing down from the consul.

939
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:10,587
You're beginning
to play with trick cards.

940
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,016
- It's a bad sign.
- I hope so for your sake.

941
01:26:22,573 --> 01:26:23,583
Well...

942
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:28,151
She's doing rather well for
someone who's supposed to be depressed.

943
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:32,580
At Monte Cassino during the war,
I saw a sergeant take a bullet

944
01:26:33,155 --> 01:26:34,858
right in the heart,

945
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:39,076
and continue to run for another
100 meters before falling down.

946
01:26:40,532 --> 01:26:43,632
Lady Dinver has her
bullet in the heart, my friend.

947
01:26:45,244 --> 01:26:48,203
I hope she falls down before Monday.
Otherwise...

948
01:26:48,825 --> 01:26:50,034
I think so.

949
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:53,156
Her last hope was
to leave Lisbon

950
01:26:53,926 --> 01:26:56,027
tomorrow, with her lover.

951
01:26:57,589 --> 01:27:00,102
That too is gone.

952
01:28:43,404 --> 01:28:45,309
He's good, don't you think?

953
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,973
He's amazing.

954
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:50,264
And he looks so miserable.

955
01:28:51,235 --> 01:28:52,621
He is miserable.

956
01:28:53,269 --> 01:28:55,899
That's probably why
he's playing so well.

957
01:28:56,533 --> 01:28:59,340
You have to be miserable
to understand that.

958
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:06,555
This cellar is his death.

959
01:29:07,787 --> 01:29:10,746
Yes. Only, he'll never have
the courage to leave.

960
01:29:11,369 --> 01:29:13,576
Because this cellar is his life.

961
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,211
When do you leave?

962
01:29:19,031 --> 01:29:20,499
In a few hours.

963
01:29:22,272 --> 01:29:24,503
It's better that way, believe me.

964
01:29:25,182 --> 01:29:27,400
I didn't come to hold you back.

965
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:32,500
I simply came to bring you what you were
looking for so desperately in me:

966
01:29:33,298 --> 01:29:34,554
the truth.

967
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,159
It will be my farewell gift.

968
01:29:41,302 --> 01:29:43,310
I killed Bill Dinver.

969
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:49,383
I married him to get rich, and I killed
him not to become poor again.

970
01:29:52,295 --> 01:29:55,906
It's not difficult to pretend
to love someone who loves you.

971
01:29:56,883 --> 01:29:59,560
You can cheat at love.
At pleasure too.

972
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,165
I cheated, Pierre...

973
01:30:04,197 --> 01:30:05,806
as much as I could,

974
01:30:06,287 --> 01:30:08,190
for as long as I could.

975
01:30:10,235 --> 01:30:13,241
And one day, he finally understood.
Like I did.

976
01:30:13,934 --> 01:30:16,341
- You'll never understand.
- I do.

977
01:30:16,992 --> 01:30:21,399
You got fed up lying, so one day you threw
it all in his face, like you're doing now.

978
01:30:21,854 --> 01:30:22,804
Yeah.

979
01:30:22,964 --> 01:30:24,754
A moment of faintness.

980
01:30:25,491 --> 01:30:27,182
At least one, Pierre.

981
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,553
My faintness is you.

982
01:30:34,664 --> 01:30:36,460
Did he agree to a divorce?

983
01:30:36,676 --> 01:30:37,682
Yes...

984
01:30:37,842 --> 01:30:41,778
as long as I agreed to void the
deed he had signed to make me rich.

985
01:30:43,765 --> 01:30:46,520
Poor Lady.
Goodbye, pounds sterling.

986
01:30:55,024 --> 01:30:57,920
He wanted to send me back
to my single cups of coffee,

987
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,565
to my bar stools,

988
01:31:00,566 --> 01:31:02,351
to my one night stands,

989
01:31:03,126 --> 01:31:04,622
to my poverty.

990
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:06,993
I got scared.

991
01:31:07,153 --> 01:31:09,164
I begged him on my knees.

992
01:31:09,796 --> 01:31:12,226
He slapped me, and he left.

993
01:31:13,736 --> 01:31:15,516
I knew where he was going.

994
01:31:15,676 --> 01:31:17,941
He had just phoned his solicitor.

995
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:21,001
I ran to the window.

996
01:31:21,798 --> 01:31:23,795
I saw him get in the car.

997
01:31:24,587 --> 01:31:27,135
I knew he would drive
like a madman.

998
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,379
I also knew that
at the slightest bump

999
01:31:30,766 --> 01:31:32,440
the axle could break,

1000
01:31:33,032 --> 01:31:34,512
had to break.

1001
01:31:35,498 --> 01:31:38,034
I had done what was needed for that.

1002
01:31:42,805 --> 01:31:45,687
You still don't have
anything to fear from Lewis.

1003
01:31:45,847 --> 01:31:49,729
He'll never be able to prove you saw
your husband get in the car. So?

1004
01:31:49,889 --> 01:31:51,398
I can tell him.

1005
01:31:52,093 --> 01:31:53,806
I am going to tell him.

1006
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:58,467
Are you mad? Even with the best lawyer in
the world, you know what you're looking at?

1007
01:31:58,742 --> 01:32:00,944
That's what he's been waiting for.

1008
01:32:02,938 --> 01:32:04,804
He's toying with my nerves.

1009
01:32:05,025 --> 01:32:07,132
He's looking for my weak point.

1010
01:32:07,919 --> 01:32:10,120
And my weak point is you, Pierre.

1011
01:32:12,010 --> 01:32:13,213
Now, go.

1012
01:32:13,795 --> 01:32:16,319
Because, in one minute, when I look up,

1013
01:32:16,953 --> 01:32:18,953
I know I'll start sobbing

1014
01:32:20,490 --> 01:32:23,496
because I love you
like you can't even imagine.

1015
01:32:34,598 --> 01:32:37,099
I will watch over you
my whole life

1016
01:32:37,463 --> 01:32:39,970
simply because of
what you just said.

1017
01:32:40,959 --> 01:32:44,716
- You're going to leave me, come.
- It's impossible! - Come on!

1018
01:32:55,896 --> 01:32:58,137
Porfirio, is my taxi downstairs?

1019
01:32:58,297 --> 01:33:00,487
Easy, I just sold you taxi!

1020
01:33:00,647 --> 01:33:03,022
Forget it.
Take Kathleen to the cargo ship.

1021
01:33:03,182 --> 01:33:07,382
I'll go pack some bags at your place,
then I'll join you. Give me the key.

1022
01:33:08,662 --> 01:33:11,558
But, Pierre...!
I can't go. I don't have my passport.

1023
01:33:11,718 --> 01:33:13,677
Don't worry, Mme Dinver.

1024
01:33:13,837 --> 01:33:16,842
The best passports are
made by the Bank of England.

1025
01:33:17,002 --> 01:33:18,220
Come along.

1026
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,750
Come in.

1027
01:33:37,686 --> 01:33:38,895
Hello, copper.

1028
01:33:45,531 --> 01:33:49,840
Oh, if you're looking for an apartment,
this one will be available in 5 minutes.

1029
01:33:50,427 --> 01:33:53,940
Mme Kathleen Dinver is leaving...
no forwarding address.

1030
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,147
- With you?
- With me, yes.

1031
01:33:56,382 --> 01:33:58,677
- Tough break, huh?
- Tough break.

1032
01:33:58,924 --> 01:34:02,658
I knew you'd get the truth
out of her one of these days, but...

1033
01:34:03,765 --> 01:34:07,957
But I thought the truth would be
enough to tear you away from her.

1034
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,763
Poor Lewis.

1035
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,946
You were hoping to find here
a woman alone,

1036
01:34:16,237 --> 01:34:18,691
desperate,
at the end of her nerves.

1037
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:22,390
So you tiptoed quietly into the room,

1038
01:34:23,376 --> 01:34:26,369
ready to finally pick the fruit
of a patient labor:

1039
01:34:26,529 --> 01:34:28,581
Kathleen Dinver's confession.

1040
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:33,006
But what do you find instead?
A common taxi driver.

1041
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:35,843
So wham!
your whole scaffolding collapses.

1042
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:39,360
Is that it?

1043
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,172
You understood everything perfectly.

1044
01:34:43,988 --> 01:34:48,214
Now you understand why the rich Kathleen
Dinver was hanging on desperately

1045
01:34:48,374 --> 01:34:50,376
to the common taxi driver.

1046
01:34:50,669 --> 01:34:54,772
A common taxi driver who is ultimately
richer and stronger than she is

1047
01:34:55,726 --> 01:34:59,707
since he's able to bring down
the great scaffolding as you say.

1048
01:35:16,078 --> 01:35:17,604
She told you...

1049
01:35:18,426 --> 01:35:20,634
that she killed Lord Dinver?

1050
01:35:22,066 --> 01:35:23,088
Yeah.

1051
01:35:23,618 --> 01:35:25,086
You lucky stiff.

1052
01:35:25,779 --> 01:35:29,806
It must be awful to hear that
with absolutely no witness around.

1053
01:35:30,193 --> 01:35:32,413
- Right, Lewis?
- It's awful.

1054
01:35:35,163 --> 01:35:37,171
Yes, Lewis, she killed him.

1055
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:40,047
She killed him,
and I don't give a damn.

1056
01:35:40,207 --> 01:35:42,208
Because I've killed too.

1057
01:35:42,869 --> 01:35:44,642
A crime on each side.

1058
01:35:45,124 --> 01:35:48,235
In fact, that's probably
what brought us together.

1059
01:35:49,092 --> 01:35:52,509
- You don't believe in fate?
- I'm a cop, M. Rouvier.

1060
01:35:53,059 --> 01:35:55,313
I only believe in fingerprints.

1061
01:35:56,311 --> 01:35:58,319
I still think you're wrong.

1062
01:35:58,683 --> 01:35:59,986
About what?

1063
01:36:00,717 --> 01:36:02,537
You killed out of love.

1064
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:05,754
And Lady Dinver killed
out of self-interest.

1065
01:36:06,197 --> 01:36:09,156
Your two murders
don't bring you together.

1066
01:36:09,316 --> 01:36:10,705
They separate you.

1067
01:36:10,865 --> 01:36:12,736
You don't know
a thing about it.

1068
01:36:12,896 --> 01:36:15,789
Memories are memories.
And ours are the same.

1069
01:36:15,949 --> 01:36:19,826
We'll talk again once you've
killed someone outside the line of duty.

1070
01:36:19,986 --> 01:36:23,480
You don't get it?
Leave me your address. We'll write.

1071
01:36:27,221 --> 01:36:29,476
Don't you want me to come with you?

1072
01:36:29,722 --> 01:36:32,601
Don't be ridiculous.
You've nothing more to hope for.

1073
01:36:32,761 --> 01:36:35,021
I have only one hope, M. Rouvier:

1074
01:36:35,255 --> 01:36:38,202
that we're not parting
as complete enemies.

1075
01:36:38,684 --> 01:36:41,481
- Sentimental, eh?
- In my spare time.

1076
01:36:42,188 --> 01:36:45,088
And I feel like
I've just lost a lot of it.

1077
01:36:45,916 --> 01:36:48,922
Very well, officer.
It'll make for a nice memory.

1078
01:37:35,895 --> 01:37:37,351
Well here we are.

1079
01:37:38,249 --> 01:37:41,208
All I can do is to wish a good trip,

1080
01:37:42,018 --> 01:37:45,928
and that the land of Brazil may be
auspicious to you, M. Rouvier.

1081
01:37:47,305 --> 01:37:49,548
How could it be otherwise?

1082
01:37:50,416 --> 01:37:52,824
Since you are loved passionately.

1083
01:37:54,106 --> 01:37:56,101
Passionately, right, M. Rouvier?

1084
01:37:56,261 --> 01:37:58,038
- Passionately.
- Sure.

1085
01:37:58,198 --> 01:38:00,717
If she told you,
it must be true.

1086
01:38:01,597 --> 01:38:03,405
Listen closely, Lewis.

1087
01:38:04,086 --> 01:38:07,245
I can tell you now.
You came this close to winning.

1088
01:38:07,553 --> 01:38:09,337
Kathleen and I were over.

1089
01:38:09,537 --> 01:38:13,900
We broke up. I was leaving alone.
You know what she was about to do?

1090
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:15,546
Let me guess.

1091
01:38:16,854 --> 01:38:19,883
She was going to run
to dear old inspector Lewis

1092
01:38:20,259 --> 01:38:22,854
and throw herself in his arms, crying...

1093
01:38:23,276 --> 01:38:25,284
"The man I love is gone.

1094
01:38:25,816 --> 01:38:28,703
"Nothing matters anymore.
Throw me in prison.

1095
01:38:28,863 --> 01:38:31,170
"I confess to killing Lord Dinver."

1096
01:38:32,171 --> 01:38:33,698
More precisely,

1097
01:38:34,073 --> 01:38:37,056
that's what she <i>told</i> you
she was going to do.

1098
01:38:37,373 --> 01:38:39,157
And you believed her.

1099
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:43,399
Which of course saved her
the trouble of actually doing it.

1100
01:38:44,421 --> 01:38:46,769
Just as she expected.

1101
01:38:48,087 --> 01:38:51,420
- I should have killed you the first day.
- Take comfort.

1102
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:54,902
That wouldn't have changed
a thing in this business.

1103
01:38:55,674 --> 01:38:57,223
Sooner or later,

1104
01:38:57,383 --> 01:39:00,899
you would have asked yourself
some basic questions.

1105
01:39:02,922 --> 01:39:06,021
Why did she give herself to me
on the very day

1106
01:39:07,020 --> 01:39:10,084
she first ran into Lewis in Lisbon?

1107
01:39:11,572 --> 01:39:15,975
Why did she tell me the truth only
when there was nothing else left to do?

1108
01:39:17,364 --> 01:39:20,182
Why wouldn't she be... hustling me...

1109
01:39:20,734 --> 01:39:22,671
Is that how you say it?

1110
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:28,033
Why wouldn't she be hustling me
the same way she hustled the other one?

1111
01:39:29,516 --> 01:39:32,146
She needed me to protect herself

1112
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:35,604
the same way she needed
the other one to get rich?

1113
01:39:36,144 --> 01:39:40,211
Why wouldn't she have lied to me
since she already lied to the other one?

1114
01:39:40,371 --> 01:39:41,600
Why, why, why...

1115
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,054
Will you shut up?

1116
01:39:43,214 --> 01:39:44,916
I'm done, M. Rouvier.

1117
01:39:45,468 --> 01:39:46,771
Bon voyage.

1118
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:51,960
M. Rouvier...

1119
01:39:54,328 --> 01:39:58,226
Allow me to give you a little present.
Lady Dinver's passport.

1120
01:39:59,426 --> 01:40:01,960
Which should raise one final question:

1121
01:40:02,902 --> 01:40:06,225
Why did she confess everything to you
on the very day

1122
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:08,996
I deprived her of her passport?

1123
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:13,713
M. Rouvier...

1124
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,261
Your suitcase.

1125
01:40:48,996 --> 01:40:50,746
Pierre, I was so afraid.

1126
01:40:53,552 --> 01:40:54,996
Afraid of what?

1127
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,795
I don't know.

1128
01:40:56,955 --> 01:40:59,884
You're afraid of everything
when you're happy.

1129
01:41:00,044 --> 01:41:02,819
Don't worry.
In one hour, the sun will be up,

1130
01:41:03,653 --> 01:41:06,494
We'll be at sea,
and everything will be over.

1131
01:41:07,069 --> 01:41:08,878
Everything will begin.

1132
01:41:12,204 --> 01:41:13,214
Yeah.

1133
01:41:16,842 --> 01:41:19,743
- What did he say to you this time?
- Who?

1134
01:41:20,553 --> 01:41:21,563
Lewis.

1135
01:41:22,725 --> 01:41:24,333
You're spying on me now?

1136
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:27,468
I was waiting.
I saw you arrive with him, that's all.

1137
01:41:27,628 --> 01:41:31,674
I almost ran out to the bridge,
calling to you for help like a madwoman.

1138
01:41:31,834 --> 01:41:32,849
Here.

1139
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,233
Look at my hand.

1140
01:41:35,786 --> 01:41:38,957
I bit myself to the quick
to stop from crying out.

1141
01:41:41,047 --> 01:41:42,749
What did he want?

1142
01:41:44,887 --> 01:41:46,073
Guess.

1143
01:41:47,553 --> 01:41:50,230
No, you're right.
You'd never be able to.

1144
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:52,272
Well...

1145
01:41:52,432 --> 01:41:54,786
M. Lewis slipped us his blessing.

1146
01:41:57,571 --> 01:41:59,849
He said, "Be happy, M. Rouvier."

1147
01:42:01,528 --> 01:42:04,228
He even gave me
a little present for you.

1148
01:42:05,355 --> 01:42:06,764
Your passport.

1149
01:42:08,311 --> 01:42:11,118
That way, you don't need
anyone to get away.

1150
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:14,241
You left so quickly earlier
that I didn't...

1151
01:42:14,484 --> 01:42:16,388
Listen, Kathleen, I beg you...

1152
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:18,808
Let's talk about something else.

1153
01:42:20,559 --> 01:42:22,414
What would be the point?

1154
01:42:23,025 --> 01:42:25,056
That's all you think about.

1155
01:42:27,733 --> 01:42:30,175
You'll think about it your whole life

1156
01:42:30,847 --> 01:42:32,127
and mine.

1157
01:42:34,163 --> 01:42:36,788
We're leaving together.
It's all that matters.

1158
01:42:36,948 --> 01:42:38,949
Leaving. What does it mean?

1159
01:42:39,772 --> 01:42:42,273
What matters is what you bring along.

1160
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:46,529
We're bringing along Lewis
on top of everything else.

1161
01:42:49,751 --> 01:42:52,054
Things will get better in time.

1162
01:42:53,321 --> 01:42:55,059
We'll get used to it.

1163
01:42:55,472 --> 01:42:56,482
Yeah...

1164
01:42:57,539 --> 01:42:59,676
I'll get used to my loneliness

1165
01:43:00,028 --> 01:43:01,531
and you to yours.

1166
01:43:02,458 --> 01:43:06,063
And our respective sorrows
will eventually get along, right?

1167
01:43:08,287 --> 01:43:09,297
Yeah.

1168
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:13,597
Maybe we've lost
the right to be difficult.

1169
01:43:14,337 --> 01:43:15,488
I haven't.

1170
01:43:15,969 --> 01:43:17,777
That's all I have left.

1171
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:22,195
Oh, I left out the best part.

1172
01:43:22,478 --> 01:43:24,562
You know the last thing
he told me?

1173
01:43:24,722 --> 01:43:29,231
That you risked nothing threatening to turn
yourself in, since you knew I'd stop you.

1174
01:43:30,792 --> 01:43:32,398
You believed him?

1175
01:43:33,598 --> 01:43:34,599
No.

1176
01:43:37,424 --> 01:43:39,928
You want to come watch us leave dock?

1177
01:43:40,486 --> 01:43:41,689
Pierre...

1178
01:43:42,423 --> 01:43:43,726
I love you.

1179
01:43:44,924 --> 01:43:49,324
This is the second time I tell you.
I think this time you'll believe me.
