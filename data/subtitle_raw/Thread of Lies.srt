It'll wrinkle after an hour anyway

But it's nice to wear
a neatly pressed shirt

8
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,381
Give me three minutes

This is just fine

10
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,784
There's no soup?

Don't complain
or we'll switch to cereal

22
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,319
Can you buy me an MP3 player?

24
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:42,913

has one and I don't

25
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,374

26
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:49,086

so, you must have one too?

27
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,463

29
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,510

32
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,268

74
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,163

It's not gonna make us homeless

75
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,791
Can you ask her
which model she wants?

76
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,796
There was something about her tone

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,466

Hello!
We're moving into 103

101
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:22,271
No room for privacy

102
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:27,401
Doesn't it smell like
old public toilet in here?

103
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,279
Didn't you check the apartment
when you signed the contract?

104
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,824
I signed when I heard
it was Chowon Apartment

105
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,371
Where do I sleep?

106
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,415
We can sleep here together

107
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:42,916
I don't think so

108
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,460
Then, you take the living room

109
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,140
We'll have to get rid of your desk
There's no room

110
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,100
You don't want me to study?

111
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:08,317
I'll get a small foldable table

112
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,485
I'll just use Cheon-ji's

113
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,157
It's okay

114
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,534
Alright

115
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,662
I'll put this in the balcony

116
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,206
Let's clean it up first

117
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,759

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,137

119
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,857

- What?

121
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,528

122
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,950
- What is it, mom?
- Rats

123
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,244
- Oh, no... catch them
- You do it

124
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,829

128
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,426
No, I'm studying for
the civil service exams

129
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,767
That is one precise middle parting

130
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,020
I appreciate the beauty of balance

131
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,314

132
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,400
So, you're a man?

133
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,568

134
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:35,862
Rats...

135
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,490
Yeah, it's a big problem
in this building

136
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,952
They're swarming in the box
in the balcony

137
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,373
Can I call 911 for this?

138
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,961
Why don't you let me handle this?

139
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,887
There is a dust pan
in the balcony

140
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,558
Which box is it?

141
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:08,562
The moldy one
in the furnace closet

142
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,234
I'll close this first
in case they try to escape

143
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,032
He's kind of dependable

144
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,681
What's wrong?

145
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,606
It's too big... I'm sorry

146
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,108
Gives me the creeps

147
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,110
So much for his big words

148
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,865
Next time I see him,
I'll give him pigtails

149
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,409
He almost broke that door

150
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,495
Dependable?

151
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,622
Did I say that?

152
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,415
Shall we call the security?

153
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:14,044
He won't lift a finger for free

154
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,633
I couldn't find the big one

155
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,635
- Argh
- Hey!

156
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,387
You can't just catch the small one

157
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,139
We'll see if it comes back

158
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,561
I gave you 10 dollars
for that tiny little one?

159
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,148
So, there might still be
a rat in there?

160
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,193
Shall I get some bug spray?

161
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,070
Like that's gonna kill a rat

162
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,990
It'll kill the ticks
on rat's skin

163
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,118
I have a feeling that
I'll run away soon

164
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,539
I have a feeling I'll be
taking more shifts at work

165
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,835
- Let me help you with other things
- No, thank you

166
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:58,046
That one
We need to throw that out

167
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,467
You can't let a stranger
in our house

168
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,344
There's nothing for him to take

169
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,515
What's your name?

170
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,642

171
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,227
Lee Man-ji

172
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,231
It's an easy name to make fun of

173
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,528
I'm Chu Sang-bak

174
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,325
Chusang Park or Chu Sangbak?

175
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,120
It's Chu Sang-bak

176
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,208
No charge for the glass
The board is three dollars

177
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,378
The dresser, also three dollars
So, six dollars in total

178
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,007
The board and the dresser are a set
You can't charge them separately

179
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:46,636
It's the size that matters
Even as a set, it's six dollars

180
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,138
Hey

181
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,224
You charged me five dollars
for a dresser similar to this one

182
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,853
You see?
I don't decide this as I want

183
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,730
There are guidelines to follow

184
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,025
Five dollars

185
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,110
Oh, come on

186
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,030
Isn't that Cheon-ji's friend?

187
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,991
It's Hwa-yeon
Bosingak owner's daughter

188
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,915
So, that's that

189
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,336
I'm hungry
Let's get something to eat, Man-ji

190
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,967
Can we have a word?

191
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,135
What about?

192
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:31,139
You can't charge people differently
as you please

193
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,434
The economy isn't
what it used to me

194
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,852
It was two weeks ago

195
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,730
Okay

196
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,485
Then, let's just settle for this

197
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,865
I'm only doing this because
you're like a son to me

198
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,828
Hello

199
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,793
We just moved here. I guess
we'll be seeing each other around

200
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,212
Right...

201
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,756
I'm back

202
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,468
We'll have two black bean noodles
with a sweet and sour pork

203
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,595
- Two black noodles and one pork
- We can't eat all that

204
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,305
We're not three people

205
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,227
Of course, we can
We're gonna need that much energy

206
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,147
- Can we cancel the pork?
- No, we'll have it

207
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,906
You gotta eat black bean noodles
when you move

208
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:34,869
I'm sick of moving
How come you never bought a house?

209
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,708
By the time I save some money
the house price soars out of reach

210
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,670
and you want to go to cram schools
to get good grades

211
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,005
What choice do I have?

212
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,506
Alright, I take it back

213
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,428
New to the neighborhood?
We also deliver

214
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,014
We'll pop around
We live next door

215
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,810
How kind of you!
Enjoy your noodles

216
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,526
Study hard for mom, okay?

217
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,279
They say 'unlucky in marriage,
poor luck with children too'

218
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,864
Prove them wrong

219
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,867
With what luck
could I possibly achieve that?

220
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,037
You talk back constantly

221
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:24,252
It's good. We are the ones
that talk... I like that

222
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,507
Mom, stop being so dramatic
You're making me uncomfortable

223
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,217
Let's just stay the way
we used to be

224
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,928
My daughter's nagging
gives me energy. It's good

225
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:57,702
Let's get this straight, moron
I didn't end it because you're a bum

226
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:05,960
Don't make the unemployment
problem your excuse

227
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,047
You just hate working

228
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,758
Don't wait for my call, you damn...

229
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:21,184
Bastard... Why would I
tell you about moving?

230
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,145
What?

231
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,023
No, don't wait for me there

232
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,575
Stop being pathetic
You've got kids to look after

233
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,287
What?

234
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,333
Cheon-ji's mom?

235
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,922
Don't you dare mention
my daughter's name

236
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,607
Good night

237
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,985
Night

238
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:23,538
Why did she do it?

239
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,624
Do you know anything about it?

240
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,855
What are you doing?

241
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,109
I had borrowed it from Cheon-ji

242
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,321
When?

243
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,239
Three months ago maybe

244
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,490
Three months?

245
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,034
She never asked for it back

246
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,912
So, you didn't bother returning it?

247
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,497
I thought she'd come get it
if she needed it back

248
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,084
So, she has to come to you
to kindly ask for it back

249
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,170
It was only a gym uniform

250
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,881
Of course
What about Cheon-ji

251
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,508
who would've been terrified
what you might do if she say no?

252
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,636
Why the fuck did
she have to kill herself?

253
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,553
What?

254
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,431
What did you say?

255
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,730
Hwa-yeon gave it to me
saying it would fit me

256
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,858
Are you friends with Hwa-yeon?

257
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,236
We got close after she invited me
to her birthday party

258
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,155
- What about Cheon-ji?
- She's not my style

259
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,202
She was best friends with Hwa-yeon

260
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,038
But I only know Hwa-yeon
not Cheon-ji

261
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,017
I'm Cheon-ji's sister

262
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,231
The scent is so thick

263
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,774
Hi

264
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,407
Can we have a word after school?

265
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,492
Cheonji

266
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,329
Hey

267
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,249
Are you her sister?

268
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,333
Yeah

269
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,795
Hi!
I'm Cheon-ji's friend, Hwa-yeon

270
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,297
Hwa-yeon

271
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:42,635
It's so great to finally meet you
Why don't you buy me a pork cutlet?

272
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,138
You don't have to

273
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,519
You two are so different

274
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,565
They say opposites attract

275
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,945
I don't have enough
for pork cutlet but...

276
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,949
Can we get two rice cakes
in chili sauce?

277
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,327
Thank you

278
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,122
Excuse me for a moment?

279
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,004
I'm going

280
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,215
I'm on my way

281
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,468
- Here's your rice cake
- Thank you

282
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,510
Hwa-yeon

283
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,928
What are you doing?

284
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,056
I met Cheon-ji's sister

285
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,684
I asked her to get pork cutlet
but she's buying me rice cake instead

286
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,732
So, what do you think?

287
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,655
She's cute

288
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,872
I felt bad about not buying you
that pork cutlet

289
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,753
Thank you

290
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:05,218
I heard you and Cheon-ji were best friends
You must be upset

291
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:09,889
I've known her since elementary school
but we weren't best friends

292
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:15,478
I don't know what the girls
said about the day she died

293
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,566
but Cheon-ji seemed quite upset
during the presentation

294
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:25,154
What are the evils of prejudice?

295
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:29,409
Especially when it is
maliciously disseminated

296
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,370
Let's look at some common ways
in which prejudice can be fostered

297
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:37,041
One, slander disguised
as a compliment

298
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,837
People react more sensitively
to smaller points than the basis

299
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,130
Example:

300
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,883
'She always gets good grades
but she's actually quite dumb'

301
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:50,555
Basis, good grades,
point, dumb

302
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:56,060
Your cruel words can kill

303
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:02,108
Are you a murderer in the making?

304
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:07,989
Thank you

305
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:16,205
What an interesting presentation!

306
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:20,501
But 'a murdererin the making'?
Don't you think you took too far?

307
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,296
Should I have said
a 'confirmed murderer' instead?

308
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,135
I'm sorry, Cheon-ji
I'm really sorry, okay?

309
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,428
Let me go

310
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,809
Cheon-ji, I'm sorry

311
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,729
Why do you always apologize to her?

312
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,314
What's the matter with her?

313
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,024
It's not like you ever
did anything to her

314
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:45,067
- What a self-absorbed bitch!
- Totally

315
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:50,865
She was going through something
terrible and I never knew it

316
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,911
So, I told myself that
I'll be a better friend for her

317
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,623
I only asked you if you were upset
and that's a pretty long answer

318
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,753
I thought you might want to know

319
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,841
Does everyone have MP3 players?

320
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:14,347
Probably, although I can't
be bother to carry mine around

321
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,640
Why?

322
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,809
Cheon-ji was asking for
an MP3 player before she died

323
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,978
I wondered if you knew
anything about it

324
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:31,197
We were going to exchange gifts
for our birthdays

325
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,367
Was it your birthday?

326
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,328
Among close friends,

327
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,456
we pick out the presents
and give each other before the birthdays

328
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,750
An early present...

329
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,545
an MP3 player
that you rarely use, no less?

330
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:47,964
That doesn't seem right

331
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,467
There are cheap ones, too
For 20 dollars or less

332
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:57,223
Stupid girl... troubled over an MP3
when there are cheaper ones, too

333
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:01,102
Why aren't you eating?

334
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,728
I am

335
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,901
Are you close with Soo-gyeong?

336
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:14,824
She's a delinquent
She's a friend of a friend's

337
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:21,414
but she seemed close with Cheon-ji
They lend each other gym uniforms

338
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:27,253
They used to lend each other
gym uniforms?

339
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,213
Well, yeah...

340
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,977
I didn't know you moved
to my neighborhood

341
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:47,732
I saw you yesterday
I thought you saw me, too

342
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,735
I would've said hi
if I did

343
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,741
These apartments are so old,
aren't they?

344
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,286
I lived here all my life
I'm so sick of this place

345
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,374
but my parents won't go anywhere
unless the restaurant shuts down

346
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,670
Well, our black bean noodle
is quite famous in this area

347
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,297
You

348
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,968
You can't stand the silence,
can you?

349
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,889
It makes you nervous

350
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,017
So, this is what she meant

351
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:29,815
I just didn't want to be rude
since you treated me

352
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,776
Cheon-ji said that you were cool

353
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,486
You really are

354
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:38,324
I think she once said that
it's hard to talk to you

355
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,243
Then again, I'm not sure

356
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:50,670
There's nothing cool about
being cool-headed about your sister's death

357
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:56,759
But I guess it's okay
to talk about it now

358
00:27:58,094 --> 00:27:59,970
I think I'll look for
her suicide note

359
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,723
I thought she didn't leave
any note

360
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,768
Why wouldn't she?
I just haven't looked yet

361
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,854
Maybe I'll start soon

362
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,899
or not

363
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,615
<i>Declaration of Friendship</i>

364
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:20,700
Cheonji

365
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,664
Are you still mad at me?

366
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,000
I already told everyone
that it was a joke

367
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,879
Didn't I correct myself about

368
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,840
Cheon-ji being bullied
in elementary school?

369
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,220
Are you still mad about that?

370
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:45,891
No, I never heard that
It's not about that

371
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,310
Alright!
I'm sorry anyway, okay?

372
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,311
Come here

373
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,858
Let's sign a
Declaration of Friendship

374
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,235
Sign here

375
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,412
This certified that Lee Cheon-ji
and Kim Hwa-yeon are best friends

376
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,794
Hey, that MP3 player you're
getting me for my birthday

377
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:17,339
Give it to me to commemorate
becoming best friends

378
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,593
I'll give you the digital camera

379
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,740
Mi-ran, tell me what your sister
told you about Cheon-ji

380
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,825
About Cheon-ji and Hwa-yeon

381
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,956
Come and have a taste

382
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,959
It's specially cooked in
low temperature for extra flavor

383
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:54,960
It's really good

384
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,005
There's no additives
or preservatives...

385
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:05,471
Noodle, quickly

386
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,472
With sauce?

387
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,724
- No, in soup
- Coming right up

388
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,809
Give me a large one

389
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,310
- A large one
- Double portion

390
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,607
The noodle's cooked just right

391
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,540
What's the matter, 'Tofu'?

392
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:40,005
I just buried my baby

393
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,976
and I'm sitting here stuffing
myself with an extra large noodle

394
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,645
trying to live

395
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,527
She's watching you from above
Go on, eat

396
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,380
This is Cheon-ji's stuff

397
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:25,593
You live in the same building
as her family?

398
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,845
Her sister asked you to
bring this over for her

399
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:29,972
Okay

400
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,498
It's true that we were best friends
but she made me feel suffocating

401
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:01,295
She would nitpick over
every little thing

402
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,006
Put the box in there

403
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,427
I was the only friend she had

404
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,804
Wasn't it because of you
that she only had you?

405
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,934
Look, I just felt bad about denying
she was my best friend, that's all

406
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:19,188
Don't try to provoke me
You won't get anywhere

407
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,357
Thanks for bringing it over

408
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,613
- Your youngest got over cold?
- Yes

409
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:31,283
Hey, I know these are
promotional give aways

410
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,747
- Thanks
- Sure

411
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,001
What's he doing here?

412
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,003
He's enjoying the free buffet

413
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,005
I think he came to see you

414
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:48,467
That pathetic asshole

415
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,054
If I saved up every penny
I spent on him...

416
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,807
Who can I blame, but myself?

417
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,935
Hello

418
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,355
Oh, sorry

419
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,941
Your hair...

420
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,111
Can I get three blocks of tofu?

421
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,947
Are you throwing a party?

422
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,365
I'm making dumplings

423
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:12,825
And, you need three blocks?

424
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,620
I make a fridge load at a time
and have them for meals

425
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,372
If you're making dumplings

426
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:22,001
get the cheaper ones over there
These are pricy

427
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,714
Oh... thank you

428
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,686
Do you know him?

429
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,021
He lives next door

430
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:45,858
A man who makes
his own dumplings

431
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,569
Do you know what shampoo he uses?

432
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,113
How would I know that?

433
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,990
He has a beautiful silky hair

434
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:56,910
Can you ask him for me?

435
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,457
Should I get a transplant?

436
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,086
Dear me... I'm sorry

437
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,840
Can we have a word?

438
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,760
Piss off
before I call the security

439
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,053
You want me to?

440
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:20,851
I just want to talk
Or I'll come everyday

441
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,728
It'll only be a second

442
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:27,733
I'm sorry for everything
Let's start over

443
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:31,528
You've done nothing wrong
I just don't like you anymore

444
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,405
No, come on
Forgive me

445
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,741
- Let me go
- I won't

446
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:36,909
For crying out loud!

447
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,286
Jeez...

448
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,458
I miss you so much
that I can't do anything

449
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:45,918
Get off of me

450
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:48,587
What the heck?

451
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,593
Have you lost your mind?

452
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,346
Leave her alone

453
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,768
What the hell?

454
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,437
You crazy bastard...

455
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,773
You crazy bitch!

456
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,484
What's your problem, bitch?

457
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,152
Stop it

458
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,654
Bitch

459
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:14,988
Here

460
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,241
Come on

461
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,995
Over here

462
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:24,498
Don't ignore my calls, okay?

463
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,008
I was about to strike back

464
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:38,262
You were letting him
beat you down all he wants

465
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,724
I used to be bullied back
in high school

466
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,351
so, I learned boxing

467
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:49,314
If you cover your face and torso,
it really doesn't hurt

468
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,817
Are you sure you're okay?

469
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,734
Absolutely

470
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,865
Can I touch your hair
for a second?

471
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,539
No? Oh, thank you

472
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:16,049
That's her

473
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,387
That girl in Class III
died because of her

474
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,735
<i>Switching seats</i>

475
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,919
I can't believe we're doing this
in middle school

476
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,089
You said Cheon-ji's father
killed himself

477
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,633
When did say that?

478
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,218
At your birthday party

479
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,929
Did I?

480
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,389
My sister is friends with Man-ji

481
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,018
She asked me about
you and Cheon-ji

482
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,940
She hit the ceiling when
I told her about the father's suicide

483
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,234
She said he was
killed in an accident

484
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,321
I don't remember saying that...

485
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,449
But it's true
You said that

486
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,952
You said that Cheon-ji is
somber because of that

487
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,746
Fine!
Tell Man-ji everything

488
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:33,126
I see so much of her everyday
that I'm growing fond of her

489
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,136
You moved to my school
in fifth grade

490
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,347
I always wanted
to be friends with you

491
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,851
Picking out your next target?

492
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,938
That hurts

493
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:58,694
I heard that your specialty
was the new girls

494
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,990
They warned me to be careful
or I'll end up like Cheon-ji

495
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:08,495
What nonsense!
Cheon-ji and I were best friends

496
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,956
Do friends do exactly
as they're told?

497
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,000
I asked her favors and
she did them for me

498
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,295
You call them favors?
They were orders and coercion

499
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,132
I'm the only one that
actually hung out with her

500
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:24,094
Did any of you even look at her?

501
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:36,982
How convenient for you is it
that she never fought back?

502
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,651
How could you be so relentless
about bullying her?

503
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,611
I would've killed myself, too

504
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:48,035
Wow, you're playing a hero?

505
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,496
Whether you like it or not,
I was her only friend

506
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,541
Alright,
so I didn't hang out with her

507
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,419
but at least,
I didn't manipulate her

508
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,379
Do you have a conscience?

509
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,007
To tell you the truth,
Cheon-ji was hard to get close to

510
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:06,261
but do you know
what your nickname is?

511
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:10,140
'Free wallet'

512
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,435
You always buy things for us
and pay for karaoke

513
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,188
Popcorn's always on you
when we go to the movies

514
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:26,239
You didn't say a word
when she was around

515
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,826
Now I'm the only bitch?

516
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:36,917
I'm gonna tell Man-ji that
Cheon-ji was an outcast

517
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,171
I have the conversation history
of our group chat room as proof

518
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:45,884
You're all accomplices

519
00:39:58,397 --> 00:39:59,815
That's mine

520
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:03,985
Get out of here

521
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,409
- Cheon-ji is coming, too?
- Yeah

522
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,411
Why do you care about her?

523
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,831
I feel sorry for her

524
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,959
Her father died when she was little
Suicide, you know?

525
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,502
Really?

526
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,922
That's why she is so somber

527
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,801
I think I heard
that somewhere, too

528
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,636
Let's refer to her as
'my sister'

529
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,763
We don't want to upset
her father's ghost

530
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:32,973
Okay

531
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:37,769
My mom doesn't like Cheon...
I mean 'my sister' either

532
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,021
She's smart and pretty

533
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,773
but her family
must be quite gloomy

534
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,650
Let's all be nice to
'my sister,' okay?

535
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,778
We don't pick on people for no reason
I hate that

536
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,029
You're right

537
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,453
There you are
Take a seat

538
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,711
You're late

539
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,464
Wasn't it three o'clock?

540
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:10,635
I must have written '3'
instead of '2' by mistake

541
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:12,721
Sorry

542
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,140
'My sister' must be upset

543
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,267
<i>Didn't she come at three last year, too?</i>
- 'My sister' showed up late 
- No more talks  about 'my sister,' okay?

544
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,478
- 'My sister' showed up late
- No more talks about 'my sister,' okay?

545
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,189
We're just talking about
our sisters

546
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,192
You have a sister, too
What's she like?

547
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:29,070
She's cool

548
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,656
<i>Order a black bean noodles for her</i>

549
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,618
Mom, can we get
a black bean noodles?

550
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,122
Where's my present?

551
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,875
What did say you wanted?

552
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,752
MP3 player

553
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,255
I'm sorry I forgot

554
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:53,637
I'm kidding!
Who cares about presents?

555
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,641
I was gonna get your present

556
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:01,102
but this is just
an early birthday party, right?

557
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:03,188
I'll give it to you
on your real birthday

558
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,731
Thanks

559
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,815
Here

560
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:08,777
Thank you, Mrs. Kim

561
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:12,739
We're all going to karaoke
after this. Are you coming?

562
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:15,867
I have to study

563
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,036
You have to study

564
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:23,583
I did invite you, okay?
You can't say I left you out later

565
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,723
<i>Look at her gobbling up
that noodle</i>

566
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,221
How is Man-ji?

567
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,182
What about her?

568
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,686
It was Hwa-yeon

569
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,188
Did something happen between
you and Hwa-yeon?

570
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,441
She picked on Cheon-ji
all the time

571
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,943
You didn't like Cheon-ji
very much either

572
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:35,905
She pretended not to know
that she was being bullied

573
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,407
I hated that more

574
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,535
Don't say that about her

575
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,124
Be honest. You didn't want to be
friends with Cheon-ji but then, she died

576
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,086
You feel guilty. So, you're
blaming Hwa-yeon for everything

577
00:43:52,088 --> 00:43:54,299
Did you bully her, too?

578
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:56,968
I was one of the nicer ones

579
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:01,348
Everyone in your class
just ignored her

580
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,141
And you were one of them

581
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,853
Only the wrong people
end up dying!

582
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,689
People like dad live

583
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,026
while mom had to die

584
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,835
The smell's killing me
Bring me my ramen

585
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:40,178
The fucking loser
can't kick the ball

586
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,265
It's right in front of you, idiot

587
00:44:52,691 --> 00:44:55,527
Stop smacking your mouth
You're disgusting

588
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:56,903
I can hear you, bitch

589
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,704
Mi-ra needs to go to cram school

590
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,164
They don't have teachers
in middle school?

591
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,084
Did you get the certificate?

592
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:12,669
It's my goddamn business

593
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,380
It's me

594
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,259
Of course, I'm in

595
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:22,887
The dumb ass loses every time
and still wants in?

596
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,728
Sorry I yelled at you

597
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,063
It's okay

598
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,357
I'm going
Thanks for the ramen

599
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:57,213
Pick up the damn phone, woman
You wanna kill yourself, too?

600
00:45:57,255 --> 00:46:01,217
I know that woman

601
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:02,761
What?

602
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,305
The woman that dad is seeing

603
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:09,058
- Shall I pay a visit to your school?
- It's okay, uncle

604
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,562
Don't tell mom, though

605
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,982
I swear if it happens again...

606
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,070
This is good

607
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,781
What a handsome boy!

608
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,200
Thank you

609
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,745
These bullies pick on him
during lunch hours

610
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:30,830
and the ten-minute breaks

611
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:37,462
And the school's solution is
to install more surveillance cameras

612
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:41,883
Have some fried tofu

613
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,301
Thank you

614
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:45,136
How polite you are!

615
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,975
Here's some pocket money for you

616
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,477
50 dollars?
That's too much

617
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,395
It's okay
You can take it

618
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:59,609
Can I ask you a favor instead?

619
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:06,449
Tell your mom about it

620
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,662
Or I'll tell to her

621
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:24,217
Are you going to
cram school tonight?

622
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,343
No

623
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:29,347
Come round my place for dinner
Your eyes have sunken

624
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:33,601
We're both busy with housework
Let's not bother with dinner invitations

625
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,019
I'll pretend I had it

626
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:38,189
We need to talk
It's about our parents

627
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,402
Supper's ready
Come on, Mi-ra

628
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,533
I can deal with no eggs
inglass noodles

629
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,159
but no fish cake in spicy rice cakes
is just unacceptable

630
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,703
It's good... try it

631
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,247
I only eat fish cakes
inspicy rice cakes

632
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,416
It's good

633
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:01,796
Never been treated as a guest before
This feels great

634
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,799
Now talk to me

635
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:13,850
Isn't your mom seeing someone?

636
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:17,604
She did
He turns out to be a jerk

637
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:20,481
I think she ended it

638
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:24,235
That jerk was my dad

639
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:28,072
I wasn't really curious
but it was your dad, huh?

640
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,198
You're not surprised?

641
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:32,118
You gave all the hints

642
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:38,875
My mom never knew about your mom
He told her that he was widowed

643
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,960
So, don't hate her so much

644
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,172
Bastard...

645
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,261
Why are you looking at me
like that?

646
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:54,182
You're so different from Cheon-ji

647
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,935
How?

648
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,437
Just... a lot

649
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,319
Didn't Cheon-ji say anything
about me?

650
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:08,988
I didn't know she had a sister

651
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,366
And I didn't know you were
friends with my sister

652
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:15,119
It's worse that hearing
she said shit about me

653
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,831
Did she know
about our mom and dad?

654
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,294
Hey! You alright?

655
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:26,214
Cheon-ji doesn't know about my dad

656
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,467
was too ashamed
to tell her about him

657
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:31,344
You okay?

658
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,097
I wasted good food

659
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:35,807
It's okay
There's plenty

660
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,481
I'm sorry
in the middle of eating

661
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:49,487
and it tastes really good
without the fish cakes...

662
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,282
but I gotta go

663
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:57,120
- Let me see you out
- No, it's okay

664
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:07,839
There's this girl in my class
who gets bullied

665
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:10,842
I don't understand why

666
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:14,679
There's always a reason

667
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:22,562
You're so prickly and yet,
you have so many friends

668
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,605
I don't have many friends

669
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,030
Don't you have a friend
who talks behind your back?

670
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:35,867
Don't be friends with
someone like that

671
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:43,541
What if she is
the only friend you've got?

672
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,502
Then, just stick to yourself

673
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,676
Who would I hang out with then?

674
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,692
Mom,

675
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:15,031
I think I was a terrible sister

676
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:20,078
I was a terrible mom

677
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:28,252
She reached out to me
loud and clear

678
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,089
But I just...

679
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,427
Listen

680
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:40,765
This is not
what Cheon-ji wants

681
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:50,525
But I have to know
what tormented her

682
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:55,780
I can't move on
without the answer

683
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,463
Lift your feet

684
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,051
You're not going to school?

685
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:22,056
Can I skip school?
I have a stomachache

686
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,308
Don't be silly
Come on

687
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:31,357
I forgot it was my friend's birthday
Can I get 20 dollars?

688
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:34,318
<i>Oh, sure...</i>

689
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:38,114
You forgot!
So, here's your money

690
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:42,326
I wish I was my daughter, too

691
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:46,497
I give you money for friends' birthdays
and because you have to go somewhere

692
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,166
It's just 20 dollars

693
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:53,045
We need to talk about that girl
What's her name...

694
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,674
I heard she died

695
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:02,013
I had a phone call
from your cram school

696
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:06,851
They said they can't keep you
because you were bullying people

697
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,688
Cram schools are business, too

698
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,150
When they ask
a paying customer to leave,

699
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,693
it must be for a serious reason

700
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,862
How come you're always
on others' side?

701
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,407
Aren't I your daughter?

702
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,618
I'm on the side of
whoever is right

703
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:27,538
How can I take the side of a daughter
who burns a hole in someone's heart?

704
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,376
Hey

705
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:34,879
Ungrateful brat

706
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:38,883
<i>5:30pm, Queen's Karaoke
I'm treating</i>

707
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:51,479
Shall we get this one together?

708
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,855
Yeah, for the two of us

709
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,531
<i>For the first three to arrive!</i>

710
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:39,235
What are you doing here?

711
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,780
I was asked to sit in
for a few hours... hi!

712
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:48,327
Can you hang out with me?

713
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:52,415
Doing what?

714
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,876
Just talk

715
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,590
I don't see you
with Cheon-ji these days

716
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,927
She died...
she killed herself

717
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,012
What?

718
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:11,642
How do you know her?

719
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,645
So, it was true

720
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,817
She's dead

721
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:22,862
Cheon-ji...

722
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:27,158
I'm asking you
How do you know her name?

723
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:36,292
I used to run into her
from time to time at the library

724
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:41,672
She liked to talk
So, we talked about stuff

725
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:43,674
or grabbed a bite to eat

726
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:46,761
She hated to talk

727
00:55:53,351 --> 00:55:56,103
I guess she
was different around you

728
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,190
She said her sister's name
was Man-ji

729
00:56:00,191 --> 00:56:03,027
And the girl who moved next door
is called Man-ji

730
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:09,700
They seemed very different
yet, looked so much alike

731
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,579
So, I wondered where Cheon-ji was

732
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,083
Why did she do it?

733
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,293
When was the last time
you saw her?

734
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,632
At the library. She was preparing
for her presentation assignment

735
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:32,723
I forgot something
I gotta go

736
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,562
<i>I wish there was a air freshener
for the mind</i>

737
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:40,606
<i>Cheer up, Lee Cheon-ji!</i>

738
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:50,032
- Hello?
- <i>It's Hwa-yeon</i>

739
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:53,911
<i>There a guy next door
with a long hair? Be careful</i>

740
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,664
He used to know Cheon-ji

741
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,207
So what?

742
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:02,545
<i>I saw her with him when
she came by my house</i>

743
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:07,591
I just said hello and
didn't think much of it

744
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,345
but apparently, they used to
meet secretly at the library

745
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,223
Is that another one of your plots?

746
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,142
<i>If that's how you want to see it</i>

747
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,769
I'm just telling you
what happened

748
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,981
Why are you telling me this now?

749
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,774
<i>I saw him today</i>

750
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:27,069
and he said 'Man-ji and
Cheon-ji are sister, right?'

751
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:31,073
<i>I thought he was just a freak
but there's something about him</i>

752
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:34,535
<i>And I wasn't gonna say this but...</i>

753
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:39,999
They met the day before
Cheon-ji killed herself

754
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:44,670
<i>May be she had a secret
that she couldn't tell anyone</i>

755
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:53,846
Hello?

756
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:59,435
Chu Sangbak

757
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:11,906
Mom, do you think...

758
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:13,866
What?

759
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:18,829
We don't know if something
horrible happened to Cheon-ji

760
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,958
like assault...

761
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:27,296
Are you talking about
sexual crime?

762
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,175
It didn't happen

763
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:34,637
How can you be sure?
What if she couldn't tell us?

764
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:37,181
What if she was pregnant?

765
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,725
She didn't even have period

766
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:44,396
Oh... you're right but what if...

767
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,024
What kind of supposition is that?

768
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,528
Did you hear something?

769
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:53,364
No, I just wondered

770
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:58,035
If there was a man, I would know
Mothers know

771
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,079
It didn't happen to her
Not to Cheon-ji

772
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,207
What if something like that
happened to me...

773
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,834
What's wrong with
your goddamn 'what if's'?

774
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,380
If anything like that happened,

775
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:13,342
I would

776
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:19,390
shred that bastard to pieces

777
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,195
Loan record?

778
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:38,158
I'm doing this for my sister and
want to make sure there's no overlap

779
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,910
I see...
Please give me that

780
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:49,461
<i>Depression can be treated
Psychology of depression...</i>

781
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,463
<i>Sick child
Overcoming depression...</i>

782
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,518
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?

783
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:07,563
Hi, Man-ji

784
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,941
Did I scare you?
Did you do something wrong?

785
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:14,028
I was thinking about something

786
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,618
So, you knew Cheon-ji?

787
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,498
I heard... I'm sorry

788
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,967
Why are you looking at me
like that?

789
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,095
You think my hair's funny, too?

790
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:44,683
Are you crazy?

791
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:45,726
I just uh...

792
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,357
Cheon-ji used to nag at me
to cut my hair

793
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,108
but I never showed her this

794
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,362
You can take a look for her

795
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:58,572
What happened?

796
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:05,537
There was a fire when I was little
Goes all the way down the back

797
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:10,959
My nickname was a monster

798
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,673
I left school and
started growing my hair

799
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,300
I'm sorry

800
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:30,688
So, you used to hang out with her
What did you talk about?

801
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,025
She hated studying

802
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,944
She loved studying

803
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,072
No, she hated it

804
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:43,325
Why do you work so hard
if you hate studying?

805
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:47,621
People don't believe you
unless you have good grades

806
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:52,209
Otherwise, your words just
get disintegrated in the air

807
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:55,379
Maybe I talked too much

808
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:59,633
No, please
Anything else?

809
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,386
What are you reading?

810
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,012
Hi

811
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,560
Overcoming depression?

812
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:17,735
There's this girl in my class
I'll give her the list of symptoms

813
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:21,530
If she acts opposite to the list,
no one will suspect her

814
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,116
Why would she do that?

815
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:32,332
Her friends will leave her
if they find out she's depressed

816
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:35,753
She hid her depression...
for some lousy friends?

817
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,925
People who have friends naturally
don't understand

818
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:49,600
At her age, friends make up
half of their entire world

819
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:55,230
How close were you
with my sister?

820
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:58,317
How can you know the things
that even a family didn't know?

821
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:05,115
Sometimes, you speak
your heart out to strangers

822
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:10,537
Stranger don't dwell
on your secrets

823
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:14,958
I was that stranger to her

824
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,923
Where was I all that time...?

825
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:25,844
Don't be hard on yourself
Families aren't supposed to know

826
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,268
Not knowing everything
helps you stick together for life

827
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:40,359
What kind of will is no will?

828
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:45,322
Is it 'don't ask'?

829
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:48,283
Or 'please hear me out...'

830
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,956
It kills me
because I don't know

831
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:01,713
Didn't I make the perfect
eggs this morning?

832
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,508
I hated uncooked yolk

833
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,219
- Just have it, will you?
- I said no

834
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:11,890
God... where did you get
that coldness from?

835
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:20,315
Cheon-ji was always lovely
She always knew how I felt

836
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:25,153
Why didn't you be nice to her
while she was around?

837
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:27,614
What?

838
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:32,578
We didn't pay attention
when she was struggling

839
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:41,044
They say you bury your child
in your heart

840
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:44,631
but I think you just
put it all behind you

841
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,343
What could I do?

842
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:54,892
You can pour cement and
smelting iron over it

843
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:58,645
You still can't put it
behind you

844
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,982
You can never bury them
because you feel sorry

845
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,692
and because you can't forget

846
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,071
Don't eat the damn eggs

847
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:17,998
How can I help you?

848
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:20,500
- How can I help you?
- How can I help you?

849
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,085
Yes, ma'am... sir

850
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:24,296
- Yes, ma'am... sir
- Yes, ma'am... sir

851
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:26,590
Enjoy Shopping with us

852
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:29,217
- Enjoy shopping with us
- Enjoy shopping with us

853
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,928
Smile, everyone

854
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,013
- Smile
- Smile

855
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,898
Ma'am, have a taste of fresh tofu

856
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,032
What are you doing here?

857
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:54,826
I was just passing

858
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,913
Why were passing here?

859
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,873
Why not?

860
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:06,672
Hey, 'Dumpling'! Boil some
dumplings for my daughter?

861
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:11,093
I just put everything away
Can't you just fry some tofu?

862
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,429
I want dumplings
Just do it

863
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,306
Oh, come on

864
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:20,769
How do I look?

865
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,022
Pretty

866
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,150
It's little too big

867
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,404
Man-ji said I have to wear it
until I graduate

868
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:32,322
What if you don't grow big?

869
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,366
I hope I will

870
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:43,875
Shall we call Man-ji and
get dinner together? Sushi?

871
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,798
- <i>What?</i>
- Where <i>are you?</i>

872
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,174
<i>I'm busy. Gotta go</i>

873
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:57,014
I would've frozen to death
if it wasn't for you

874
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:01,143
How pretty you are!
I heard you're top of the class

875
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:03,103
Your mom can't stop
bragging about you

876
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:05,856
- Here you go, princess
- Thank you

877
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:09,401
Your mom's in a good mood
You can tell her anything you want

878
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:14,573
I want her to stop being lonely

879
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:21,955
Maybe I should start dating again

880
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,999
I'm totally supportive of that

881
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,336
Aren't you the sweetest

882
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:32,090
Come on, there's gotta
be something you want?

883
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,051
What I want?

884
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:41,349
A chair for her

885
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:51,485
Let's get some tampons
I know you've been stealing from me

886
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,403
That's fine
Just come home early

887
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:57,741
I'll stay up

888
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,831
Man-ji...

889
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:07,959
you touch my heart
when I didn't expect

890
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:18,303
I don't know
It happens outside my door

891
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:22,474
Only our plates are stolen

892
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:26,728
Are you accusing me?

893
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:30,065
I ordered from you
because we're neighbors

894
01:08:30,065 --> 01:08:33,944
It's just that... for some reason,
our plates have been going missing

895
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:36,780
We get tons of complaints
about our food, too

896
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:39,199
What would I do with
your delivery plates?

897
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,536
They make great flowerpot holders

898
01:08:42,536 --> 01:08:44,287
I don't keep any plant
in my apartment

899
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:45,914
I'm sorry

900
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:48,959
I'm worried about customers
dropping out by the dozens

901
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,253
Who's stealing the delivery plates?

902
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:53,797
That's the least of our concern

903
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:58,552
There is a rumor that we use
rotten ingredients

904
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,470
Who's been saying such things?

905
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,389
I think I might know

906
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:09,521
I love eating dumplings
and feeding them to others

907
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,150
Oh dear

908
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,658
- Really?
- Why won't people buy more dumplings?

909
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,076
It's really good

910
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,537
It makes a perfect
healthy snack for everyone

911
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:43,221
Mom, I don't feel well

912
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:44,431
Where?

913
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:50,145
My stomach hurts
Can I skip school today?

914
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,024
You have to go to school anyway

915
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:57,694
If it gets really bad,
go to the nurse's office

916
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,157
How come you always
lose your gym uniforms?

917
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,076
Yes, speaking

918
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,539
<i>I don't know if this is appropriate
but there's a girl called Hwa-yeon</i>

919
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:12,167
<i>who seems to pick on Cheon-ji</i>

920
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,252
<i>Maybe it's best to pull them apart</i>

921
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,503
I see

922
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:19,216
Let the kids sort it out
between themselves

923
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:25,513
You should raise your child
to be clever, not cunning

924
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,557
What?

925
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:31,811
It's your fault that
you raised yours meek

926
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,523
Please leave, I'm busy

927
01:10:39,361 --> 01:10:42,572
Shall we order black bean noodles
for dinner?

928
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:48,870
I hate black bean noodles
more than anything in the world

929
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:54,292
Okay...
let's boil some ramen then

930
01:10:54,668 --> 01:11:00,298
I'll die because of
black bean noodles

931
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:19,859
Mom

932
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,113
What's wrong?

933
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:29,160
Mom?

934
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,958
God, you're boiling!
Wait for me, okay?

935
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,550
Hello?

936
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,929
Hello, is anyone there?

937
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:55,812
Are you alright?

938
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,898
I'm okay

939
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,152
You sure?

940
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:03,320
Yeah

941
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,615
What are you doing here?

942
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:11,244
Why couldn't you
find this yourself?

943
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:15,749
Look in there

944
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,083
What?

945
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,546
There is a note
that Cheon-ji left

946
01:12:34,476 --> 01:12:37,062
<i>My dearest sister
who I've always envied</i>

947
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:40,940
<i>Don't forget me even if
I go to a faraway place</i>

948
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,193
<i>I love you, sis</i>

949
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:47,405
<i>Second of five sealed yarns</i>

950
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:51,701
Why didn't you tell me?

951
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:54,037
I'm telling you now

952
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,876
It's the second one of five

953
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,796
It means there are more

954
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,302
Because I didn't have this...

955
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:22,190
Thank you, Cheon-ji

956
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:25,193
Cheonji

957
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,913
Can I get a black bean noodle?

958
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,833
One black noodle for here

959
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,839
It's pretty quiet
Maybe because it's a weekday

960
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:50,343
With this economy,
it's no different in the weekend

961
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:56,933
I just moved and I didn't
come around to say hello properly

962
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,199
Have a drink?

963
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:15,410
Why not

964
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:26,504
I heard about what happened

965
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:31,801
I sit here all day but
news carries itself here

966
01:14:36,139 --> 01:14:38,057
You must be devastated

967
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:43,646
but maybe it wasn't her fate
to have a long life

968
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:48,860
I think her destined life
was average

969
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:52,947
until someone shortened it for her

970
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,041
I came to give you this

971
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:10,173
My daughter wanted to
give this to Hwa-yeon

972
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:16,971
It would've been nice
if she could give it herself

973
01:15:18,348 --> 01:15:20,600
I hope your daughter likes it

974
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:26,105
The noodle's on the house

975
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,858
- No, thank you
- Cheon-ji's mom...

976
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,319
Don't!
If you're going to apologize

977
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,158
An apology in words

978
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,915
is acceptable only
when you can forgive

979
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:46,459
If you get an apology
you can't accept

980
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:53,132
it'll only stab you in the heart

981
01:15:54,509 --> 01:16:00,557
Especially when I have
no intention of hearing

982
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:07,564
It's just a convenient excuse
for you to hide behind

983
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:11,234
'I apologized but
she didn't accept it'

984
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,406
That's what you're gonna say

985
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:33,381
I'm sorry but I can't
pass this to my daughter

986
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:13,171
Now you know
why I moved here

987
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:19,510
I want you to look at my face
for the rest of your lives

988
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,703
Chinese restaurant

989
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:50,500
Oh, hello... sorry?

990
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:59,050
Hwa-yeon fell ill
So, she's taking a rest at home

991
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:02,053
I'll send her as soon
ass he feels betters

992
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:10,353
Please understand
if she acts strangely

993
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:15,525
The dead girl's mother
moved here on purpose

994
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,278
Of course, she can't have

995
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:22,907
Okay... thank you

996
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:27,120
Was that her teacher?
She skipped school?

997
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:31,999
How can you be so uninterested?

998
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:35,461
She's so full of silly thoughts
in her head

999
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,046
I'm gonna teach her a lesson

1000
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,341
Will you just shut up?

1001
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:47,640
Oh, God!

1002
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:08,286
<i>You used to knit</i>

1003
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,246
This is for you

1004
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:15,418
How are you feeling?

1005
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,336
Better

1006
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,180
Shall we start?

1007
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,600
It's still break time

1008
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,519
Alright...
I'll just leave the books here

1009
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:36,230
I wanted to spend more
time with you, that's all

1010
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:38,858
Miss Lee

1011
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:39,942
Yes'?

1012
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:44,906
I'm not feeling well
Can I sit in the front?

1013
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,117
Who wants to switch seats
for Hwa-yeon?

1014
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:50,244
I will

1015
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:54,081
Okay, I'll see you
when the break is over

1016
01:19:57,627 --> 01:20:00,671
Thanks...
This is for you

1017
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:11,933
What are you making?

1018
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,976
A sitting mat

1019
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:15,478
Will you make one for me?

1020
01:20:15,853 --> 01:20:17,230
Are you crazy?

1021
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,989
- Where are you going?
- She's upset because of you

1022
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,616
What did I do?

1023
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:33,412
Oh, forget it

1024
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:38,167
Did we have homework
for this class?

1025
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:42,046
Why come all the way here
to ask that?

1026
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,678
Wanna go to the restroom with me?

1027
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:52,515
No, Mi-so had to move
because of you

1028
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,101
I'm sorry but
I couldn't see the board

1029
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:58,020
It's always the dumb ones
that complain about the board

1030
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:10,032
I can't take it anymore
I should go home

1031
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:26,048
- Talk to her for me?
- Yes, miss

1032
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,925
Okay

1033
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:37,894
That's my yarn, miss

1034
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:42,231
Don't knit during the class

1035
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:46,986
I wasn't
I just had it out on the desk

1036
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:48,738
Is it a scarf?

1037
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:52,575
Just a wide plane

1038
01:21:52,742 --> 01:21:54,285
Alright, you can go now

1039
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:14,263
So, you're just knitting
a square shape?

1040
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,101
Did Miss Lee ask you
to talk to me?

1041
01:22:19,143 --> 01:22:22,063
No... to Miso

1042
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,066
I guess it's something
the teachers can see

1043
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:29,946
But I don't want to
She'll just snap at me

1044
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:38,204
So, your this class'
Miss Congeniality?

1045
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:41,624
Only because I'm average
in every aspect

1046
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:45,628
Not pretty, not bright,
not rich...

1047
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:50,716
I liked your answer
'Just a square'?

1048
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,767
I keep knitting a wide plane
until I feel it's enough

1049
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:01,644
Then I undo it

1050
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:04,647
Is this wide enough

1051
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,733
More or less

1052
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,820
Then, let's undo it
Can I?

1053
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,052
What's this place?

1054
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:19,138
Just where the red wool led us

1055
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:23,517
You didn't know you had a smile

1056
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,479
I smile a lot

1057
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:28,481
Alright

1058
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:44,080
I love this place
Can I come everyday?

1059
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:47,249
Of course

1060
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:57,426
Like this?

1061
01:24:57,843 --> 01:24:58,761
Like this

1062
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:21,784
I'm telling the truth
This time, she's really dead

1063
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,953
Go to hell

1064
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:28,457
No, you just had your punishment
now that your wife's gone

1065
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:31,627
That's what I keep telling you
She's really dead

1066
01:25:31,752 --> 01:25:34,463
You're a lot bigger jerk
than I thought

1067
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,298
Get out of my sight

1068
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:39,802
Hey

1069
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,512
I'm serious...

1070
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:47,059
You tormented mom
until the day she died

1071
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:49,270
because of someone like this?

1072
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:50,813
Watch it

1073
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:58,571
This is what I deserve
for dating a jerk?

1074
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:05,161
I'll let this one pass because
I sympathize with how you feel

1075
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:09,540
Hey!

1076
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,501
How dare you?

1077
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:18,174
Don't be rude
She'll be your step mom

1078
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:20,342
Wait! Cheon-ji's mom!

1079
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:27,349
Cheon-ji's... mom?

1080
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:45,367
Did you say that your mom
worked in GS Mart?

1081
01:26:45,993 --> 01:26:48,913
Yeah... why?

1082
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:50,956
Nothing

1083
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:58,547
I don't feel well from
all the potato chips

1084
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:06,889
I think you're mom
is dating someone

1085
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:12,811
I'm supportive

1086
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:19,193
Yeah, life must rosy for her
when the daughter's like this

1087
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:22,446
What do you mean by that?

1088
01:27:22,529 --> 01:27:26,367
Stop pretending you don't know

1089
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:30,037
What are talking about?

1090
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:32,873
Why ask me when
you know damn well?

1091
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:37,294
By the way, it was
Miss Lee's favor

1092
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:42,841
to talk to you, the biggest
pathetic outcast of this class

1093
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:48,430
But I'm tired of it

1094
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:04,697
Is this the library?
I was wondering

1095
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:07,199
if you had a ball of red yarn
in lost and found

1096
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,660
I'll hold

1097
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:11,662
Were you out?

1098
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:14,039
It's heavy
Give me a hand

1099
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:17,126
You don't?

1100
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:19,128
I see... thank you

1101
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,171
Cheon-ji's mom

1102
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:25,801
Get out of here
before I call the police

1103
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:26,844
Who is he?

1104
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:28,053
Go inside

1105
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,805
You must be Man-ji

1106
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,140
What's going on?

1107
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,309
- He's nobody. Go inside
- Hi. I'm the...

1108
01:28:33,309 --> 01:28:35,644
I'm your mom's...

1109
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:37,396
Your mom's what?

1110
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:40,107
You obviously haven't seen
my temper yet

1111
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:42,109
Stop talking to me like that

1112
01:28:42,109 --> 01:28:43,944
Or what?
You'll hit me?

1113
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:47,489
You wanna serve time
for beating your wife, too?

1114
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:51,243
Don't try my temper

1115
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,332
Who the hell are you?

1116
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:58,000
I see you a lot, bitch...

1117
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,377
What are you a man
or a woman?

1118
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:02,004
A man

1119
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:06,175
Walk away
It's not your business

1120
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:09,386
Bring it on

1121
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:10,679
Don't

1122
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,097
Show me what you got

1123
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:14,016
What's wrong with you?

1124
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:21,857
Whoa!

1125
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:29,114
He's down
Hit him some more

1126
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:30,491
Mom!

1127
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,119
I'm sorry...
Are you okay?

1128
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:35,371
You bastard!

1129
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:37,748
Please, stop

1130
01:29:37,748 --> 01:29:38,999
Mi-ran's father!

1131
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:40,417
What?

1132
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:46,799
Think about Mi-ran and Mi-ra
if you have the energy for this

1133
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:49,843
How do you know
Mi-ran and Mi-ra?

1134
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:52,721
Mi-ran's my best friend
and Mi-ra was Cheon-ji's

1135
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:56,308
And I hate the idea of you
becoming my stepdad

1136
01:29:57,351 --> 01:30:03,690
She sure can speak her mind

1137
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:05,859
Man...

1138
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:13,200
I'm bleeding

1139
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:19,373
Your dad just stirred up trouble
in my house

1140
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:25,963
It's not like that
It's over between them

1141
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:28,924
Maybe that's a good idea

1142
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:32,344
Pack your bag and
get out of there fast

1143
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:34,888
Tell them to come here

1144
01:30:36,265 --> 01:30:38,350
bring their schoolbags
and uniforms

1145
01:30:41,979 --> 01:30:47,317
They say shit happens in life
What you saw what that shit

1146
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:50,946
Are you okay?

1147
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:54,950
As you can see, I'm fine

1148
01:30:55,159 --> 01:30:57,578
How did you end up seeing
someone like that?

1149
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,621
You must have pretty low standards

1150
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,549
Just kidding

1151
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:21,059
This coffee's really good
Is it Maxim?

1152
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,772
Shall I give you a trim?
Maybe like this?

1153
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:26,857
What's the matter?

1154
01:31:26,857 --> 01:31:28,400
Time for shampoo

1155
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,002
Here

1156
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:50,172
Thank you

1157
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,716
You haven't had a proper
homemade meal in a while

1158
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:57,179
It's not much but
it'll taste alright

1159
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,813
Does your dad
come home often?

1160
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:10,859
He doesn't seem like
the type to care

1161
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:15,531
You used to come to
the store I work in

1162
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:19,243
I could tell you're used
to grocery shopping

1163
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:21,870
You know, I faltered briefly

1164
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:24,706
thinking about you girls

1165
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,751
Shall I bite the bullet
for the sake of the girls?

1166
01:32:30,254 --> 01:32:34,049
But after Cheon-ji passed,
I realized how silly I was

1167
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:36,218
I couldn't even
look after my child

1168
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:43,892
They say all the wrong doings of the parents
are passed down to their children

1169
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:49,231
I don't know how he treats you

1170
01:32:49,273 --> 01:32:52,985
but he shouldn't have done that
to me or to your mother

1171
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:57,239
He doesn't know
what he's doing wrong

1172
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:00,826
We're doing fine on our own

1173
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:04,621
I know, I can see that now

1174
01:33:05,414 --> 01:33:07,791
Your mother did a good job
raising you

1175
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:10,252
Come on, eat up

1176
01:33:17,426 --> 01:33:21,054
Mi-ra, don't take the trouble
to go to other grocery store

1177
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:23,599
Ours is the best in this area

1178
01:33:24,433 --> 01:33:28,770
You can't avoid or block out
someone forever by trying

1179
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:32,065
And there is no need to
forgive or love everyone

1180
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:36,778
Just let yourself feel
what you feel

1181
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:43,368
What's wrong, sweetie?

1182
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:54,421
You seem like a lot better person
than I thought, but my dad...

1183
01:33:57,591 --> 01:34:02,346
She must be over whelmed
by a proper home cooking

1184
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:06,975
Eat up
Clean out your plate

1185
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:12,105
Mom

1186
01:34:12,481 --> 01:34:15,525
Didn't you say you look
at the face in a man?

1187
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,693
Yeah

1188
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:22,032
My dad's not exactly...

1189
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:31,708
You guys don't know
That's the look that ruled the 80's

1190
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,222
What's this?

1191
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:52,104
Hwa-yeon, that crazy bitch

1192
01:34:53,522 --> 01:34:54,856
Did Hwa-yeon give it to you?

1193
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:56,108
Yeah

1194
01:34:56,692 --> 01:34:57,943
Can I have it?

1195
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:02,531
Whatever!
This is so annoying

1196
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,619
Hey, what brings you here?

1197
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:11,206
Do you have the ball of yarn
that I gave you earlier?

1198
01:35:11,373 --> 01:35:14,334
It's probably still in my locker
Why?

1199
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:18,130
This note was in the yarn ball
that Cheon-ji gave Hwa-yeon

1200
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:23,969
You really can't be separated

1201
01:35:28,056 --> 01:35:29,391
Where did you get this?

1202
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:32,811
It was in the yarn ball
that Cheon-ji gave Hwa-yeon

1203
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:35,605
Do you know about this?

1204
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:41,069
Why do you have it, not Hwa-yeon?
Where is she?

1205
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:43,113
She hasn't been
coming to school much

1206
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:46,450
So, the yarn ball you gave me...
Cheon-ji gave it to you?

1207
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:58,879
'A murderer in the making'
That's a warning, isn't it?

1208
01:36:00,297 --> 01:36:02,758
Hwa-yeon won't lift an eyebrow

1209
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:06,595
Wasn't it fun for all of you?

1210
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:11,433
Are you coming, too?

1211
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,809
Yeah

1212
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:15,270
Is there nothing
you want to ask me?

1213
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:23,862
If I asked you why you bully me,
you'll say you've never done that

1214
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:27,491
Did you bother to ask?

1215
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:31,578
For years, she wrote three o'clock
on your invitation,

1216
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:33,705
but you always show up at three

1217
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:38,126
You play along when you know
that 'my sister' is you

1218
01:36:38,794 --> 01:36:42,964
You just pretended not to know
That's what scares me

1219
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:48,094
You and Hwa-yeon both think
that you can only keep friends

1220
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:51,890
by picking on someone

1221
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:56,478
Do it all you want

1222
01:36:57,562 --> 01:36:59,648
I won't wince

1223
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:05,278
I'm different from Hwa-yeon
I have reasons

1224
01:37:06,363 --> 01:37:10,742
But Hwa-yeon, she won't realize
until someone ends up dead

1225
01:37:16,665 --> 01:37:20,669
Why do you always carry
that color of yarn?

1226
01:37:26,258 --> 01:37:27,676
You...

1227
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:39,020
What is it that you want to see?

1228
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:49,698
No. Mi-ra should read it

1229
01:37:50,282 --> 01:37:52,450
It was meant for her

1230
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:10,594
I'll just read it later

1231
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:15,724
I didn't know
I really didn't know

1232
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:17,100
Open it

1233
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:27,068
<i>Couldn't you keep some of the thing
you said to yourself?</i>

1234
01:38:27,485 --> 01:38:30,030
<i>Sometimes the words
from your mouth</i>

1235
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:32,741
<i>cut deep into my heart</i>

1236
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:35,160
<i>but I'll forgive you</i>

1237
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:38,455
<i>because I remember
the first time I saw you smile</i>

1238
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:46,421
What did you do to her?

1239
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:53,511
Why'd you hit me?
I've been good to her all along

1240
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:57,682
while everyone pretended
as if she didn't exist

1241
01:38:57,766 --> 01:39:02,062
But after I saw dad with her mom

1242
01:39:02,437 --> 01:39:04,606
I couldn't forgive her

1243
01:39:05,649 --> 01:39:10,028
Who does she think she is
to forgive me?

1244
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:11,446
Are you crazy?

1245
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:13,990
- Why drag dad into this?
- Shut up!

1246
01:39:18,787 --> 01:39:21,790
Did you play her?

1247
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:25,627
It's not like that...

1248
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:28,797
I'm sorry

1249
01:39:28,922 --> 01:39:30,799
Did you play her like a goddamn toy?

1250
01:39:30,799 --> 01:39:32,425
Stop it, Man-ji

1251
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:36,721
Mi-ra was one of few
who were nice to her

1252
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:40,558
Then, she got mad after
seeing our parent together

1253
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:44,688
It was one fight
How can anyone...

1254
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:47,816
die over it?

1255
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,320
I'm sorry...

1256
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:57,492
I know how you feel

1257
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:01,246
but if you have something
to say to my sister

1258
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:04,124
talk to me
Don't yell at her

1259
01:40:07,002 --> 01:40:08,336
Let's go, Mi-ra

1260
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:24,352
You're so good, I hate you

1261
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:31,443
She's not going to college?

1262
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:37,532
She gave up college and
wanted to move to a vocational class

1263
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:46,207
but after what happened to her sister,
she changed her mind

1264
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,334
She says she wants to
go to a good college

1265
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:55,842
With her grades, she can apply
to any college of her choice

1266
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:56,885
I see

1267
01:40:57,052 --> 01:40:59,804
If you look here...

1268
01:41:41,930 --> 01:41:43,098
AAC

1269
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,642
AAB

1270
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,107
How beautiful you are

1271
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:58,113
Please don't die early

1272
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:35,984
You know the Chinese restaurant
outside Chowon Apartments

1273
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,403
They got busted for using
out of date flour

1274
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:41,990
I had food poisoning
from eating there earlier

1275
01:42:43,491 --> 01:42:46,786
Bosingak!
The one right outside the building

1276
01:43:11,269 --> 01:43:12,896
You came far

1277
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:15,273
What have you got there?

1278
01:43:16,649 --> 01:43:18,026
It's ours

1279
01:43:18,193 --> 01:43:19,527
Yours?

1280
01:43:22,363 --> 01:43:24,365
Never mind
It's from my parent's restaurant

1281
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:27,118
Yes. So, these are
from your restaurant

1282
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:30,747
Harassing your parent won't
helps you release your anger

1283
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:35,335
You can only live
by torturing someone?

1284
01:43:35,335 --> 01:43:39,255
This is the only way we'll move
After the restaurant shuts down

1285
01:43:41,216 --> 01:43:43,176
Why are you doing this to me?

1286
01:43:44,928 --> 01:43:46,262
Why?

1287
01:43:48,223 --> 01:43:52,060
Why? Everyone else except you
will know why, bitch!

1288
01:43:53,186 --> 01:43:54,938
Why did you do it to Cheon-ji?

1289
01:43:55,188 --> 01:43:57,565
Why did you all do it to her?

1290
01:43:59,609 --> 01:44:04,572
You can kill yourself over nothing
She was a freak all along

1291
01:44:05,907 --> 01:44:09,577
Everyone says that about her
Where could she go?

1292
01:44:09,661 --> 01:44:12,914
How is she supposed to say
how much she suffered

1293
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:17,627
how broken and torn she was

1294
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:22,966
I hate going to school

1295
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:27,595
I hate it so much
that I'm gonna go crazy

1296
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:30,640
And Cheon-ji's not there anymore

1297
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:36,896
No one believe me
when I say this

1298
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:40,024
No one!

1299
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:44,279
But I miss her, too

1300
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,658
I really miss her

1301
01:44:53,246 --> 01:44:54,664
You, crazy bitch

1302
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:16,144
Let's go

1303
01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:19,480
Man-ji

1304
01:45:19,605 --> 01:45:22,817
Come on. It's dangerous
to be by yourself here

1305
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:30,700
I'm so sorry
Forgive me

1306
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:40,877
Cheon-ji left this for you

1307
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:59,228
<i>I'll forgive you before I go</i>

1308
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:04,192
<i>Because you'll still be here
after I'm gone</i>

1309
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:09,280
<i>I wish you won't do it again</i>

1310
01:46:10,365 --> 01:46:14,160
<i>I wish you won't suffer no more</i>

1311
01:46:16,996 --> 01:46:19,499
Don't manipulate people
from now

1312
01:46:20,083 --> 01:46:23,169
No matter what glittery things
you have in your hands

1313
01:46:23,544 --> 01:46:27,340
It's nothing to those who
doesn't care about them

1314
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:30,718
And I will make sure

1315
01:46:31,386 --> 01:46:35,181
that you don't wear out
and follow my sister's path

1316
01:46:36,808 --> 01:46:38,810
Not because I like you

1317
01:46:38,893 --> 01:46:44,273
but because I can't let my sister
take blames even after she died

1318
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:48,694
I start now

1319
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:51,656
until I find her
last ball of yarn

1320
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:56,077
Let's go home

1321
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:58,139
<i>I'm sorry for leaving early</i>

1322
01:47:58,973 --> 01:48:01,476
<i>I'll eat well wherever I go</i>

1323
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:08,649
<i>So, promise me that
you'll be strong</i>

1324
01:48:09,692 --> 01:48:13,070
<i>or I'll be very sad</i>

1325
01:48:14,906 --> 01:48:17,658
<i>I love you, mom</i>

1326
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:29,545
I love you, too, Cheon-ji

1327
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:50,394
Were you waiting for me?

1328
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:58,653
I'm so tired
Give me a piggyback ride?

1329
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,988
You will?

1330
01:51:02,448 --> 01:51:05,201
Oh, I am so happy!
You come to me

1331
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:13,250
You cold-hearted brat
Wait! Stop

1332
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:16,879
Only because you're
embarrassing me

1333
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:21,217
Don't push it, mom

1334
01:51:32,103 --> 01:51:33,270
Come on

1335
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:36,774
It's awkward

1336
01:51:37,024 --> 01:51:38,192
As you like

1337
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:46,784
Mom

1338
01:51:47,535 --> 01:51:49,370
Cheon-ji was in my dream

1339
01:51:51,372 --> 01:51:52,790
Was she smiling?

1340
01:51:53,332 --> 01:51:58,796
The widest smile...
We gave her a big hug

1341
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:04,260
She must be doing well

1342
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:45,676
<i>My dear little sister,</i>

1343
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:50,264
<i>you've always been
the sweetest sister</i>

1344
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:56,270
<i>I won't forget you
no matter how far away you are</i>

1345
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:01,150
<i>I love you, sis</i>

1346
01:53:38,062 --> 01:53:39,814
<i>I hope you're well and happy</i>

1347
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:43,692
<i>It was nothing after a while,
isn't it?</i>

1348
01:53:45,486 --> 01:53:48,948
<i>Thank you for pulling through it</i>
