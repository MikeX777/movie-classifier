1
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,358
- What's up?

2
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:39,191
Babe?

3
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,941
What's that?

4
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,262
What is that doing here?

5
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:43,473
What is this?

6
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:44,533
What the?

7
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:47,497
- Yeah this whole fiasco
started about five,

8
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:51,488
six years ago when my wife
passed away, Jessie's mom.

9
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:54,397
He was never the same after that.

10
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:56,405
He just stopped going to school.

11
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:58,971
He just disappeared for days on end.

12
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,097
I had no idea where he
was; when he'd come back,

13
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:05,654
he'd have no answers for me,
just like talking to a wall.

14
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:09,100
He even sold my dead wife's jewelry.

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,267
I mean how low can you go?

16
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:15,238
A disgrace, how can you do that?

17
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:18,162
I mean she just died;
you sold all the jewelry.

18
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,218
- I wanna know what is that doing here.

19
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:22,292
I don't know.

20
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,386
Sit down!

21
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:27,990
He's killing what's left of my family.

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,691
My biggest fear is that
I'm gonna lose Jessie,

23
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,226
lose another loved one.

24
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:37,476
I mean first my wife, and now I see him

25
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,364
going,

26
00:01:40,364 --> 00:01:41,966
going away,

27
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:42,883
even dying.

28
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:55,891
Nothing else to say.

29
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:56,724
I don't know what else to say.

30
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:58,107
I don't know what to do.

31
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:25,494
Fuck you, I'm an
Egyptian Christian, asshole.

32
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,222
- Hey, Sweetie Puss.

33
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,686
What a fucking mess, huh?

34
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,500
You know, it really wouldn't
hurt you to clean up

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,445
every once in a while.

36
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:57,445
- Sup, Fish?

37
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:00,486
- Dang, Sweetie Puss.

38
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:04,247
How ya doin', Sweetie Puss?

39
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:05,797
- You had a good time with the boys?

40
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:06,630
- Uh-Huh.

41
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,744
You know, Sweetie Puss, I was thinking.

42
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,774
How 'bout we fuck?

43
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,987
- Fuck Fish, you really know how

44
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,237
to make girls' juices flow.

45
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,811
- Don't tell me you got another migraine.

46
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,889
- I have one every day
as you already know.

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,133
- A couple of months, it's gotten worse.

48
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:50,726
He started getting--

49
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:52,204
- Come on, Sweetie Puss.

50
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:55,333
Come on, you gotta give me
a little blowjob, alright?

51
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,712
Come on, just a little sucky sucky, huh?

52
00:03:57,712 --> 00:03:59,105
You know what I'm saying?

53
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:08,559
- Okay, but you gotta close your eyes.

54
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,392
- Alright.

55
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:23,485
- That bitch, I swear to to fuck.

56
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,606
- I'm flabbergasted.

57
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:29,766
You're a lunatic,
Athena, but a lovely one.

58
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:34,706
- I just don't understand
why this dick has no empathy.

59
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:36,610
He's such a selfish bastard.

60
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,231
- I agree completely, Honey, but true love

61
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,304
should carry every
burden in a relationship.

62
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:44,145
- Fuck true love; I'm not
sure that even exists.

63
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,367
- Love should be overarching.

64
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,187
At least, that's how I imagine it

65
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:50,414
if I ever find Mr Perfect.

66
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:52,708
- Oh, you will babe; you will.

67
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,989
You're the most awesome and
beautiful girl in the world.

68
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:59,545
The only problem is this
world is filled with assholes.

69
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:03,363
They don't appreciate girls like you.

70
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,174
Check.

71
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:14,444
- You're welcome.

72
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,839
- You know, I might stay a little longer.

73
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,168
Can I have a latte?

74
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:22,001
- Sure.

75
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:30,367
- One of the difficult ones?

76
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,710
- One?

77
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,877
I forgot when I last time
enjoyed this fucking job.

78
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:39,706
- Hey, coming to get your coffee?

79
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:40,776
- Ladies.

80
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:41,609
- Helen Darling, how are you?

81
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,106
- Good, thanks.

82
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,261
- So what's up?

83
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:45,094
- Not much, and you?

84
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:48,940
- Life is marvelous and
Jacob is a treasure.

85
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,773
- I see.

86
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,201
- It's not even worth talking about.

87
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,748
It's always the same issue.

88
00:06:52,748 --> 00:06:53,581
- I'm sorry to hear that.

89
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,664
So how's Mom?

90
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:58,021
- There's something called visiting, girl.

91
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,824
Have you heard of
telephone to get in touch

92
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:02,216
with people you know?

93
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:03,426
- I know and I feel bad about it, I do,

94
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:05,053
but I'm in the middle of final exams

95
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:06,889
and I have no time for anything.

96
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,182
- Hey, Mom is not just anything.

97
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:12,922
- Damn Athena, you know
exactly how I meant it.

98
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,255
- Here go, Baby.

99
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,715
- Thanks, I gotta go.

100
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:18,521
I promise I'll try to visit her.

101
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:25,869
- Yeah, adieu yourself in the ass.

102
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:36,940
- So yeah man, it must have
been like eight months ago.

103
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,792
- Yeah, fuck that; I can
never go that long without it.

104
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,010
- Yeah bro, and bitch is a lazy ass too.

105
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,891
You should see the mess in our crib, bro.

106
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:46,595
- Have you ever thought about
cleaning up after yourself?

107
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:49,979
- What do you think I'm
doing every second week?

108
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,561
But it only takes her a day and we're back

109
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:54,289
into motherfucking Hoarder's Paradise

110
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,922
all because of those fucking
migraines and other excuses.

111
00:07:58,922 --> 00:08:00,013
I don't wanna talk about that.

112
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,459
- You know, migraines
have become an epidemic

113
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,481
in the last 20 years and
the causes are really

114
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:04,604
hard to diagnose.

115
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:05,657
You should take that seriously

116
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:06,794
and take her to a neurologist.

117
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:09,433
- She's been to every specialist, alright,

118
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,842
not to mention taken
every pill on this planet,

119
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:15,462
every scan, CAT Scan, MRI
Scans, you know about that shit.

120
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,197
Dude, asshole scans!

121
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:20,893
Nothing works, that's why I'm starting

122
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:23,051
to think it's all fucking bullshit.

123
00:08:23,051 --> 00:08:25,399
- Maybe she should try
some alternative medicine,

124
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,470
acupuncture, something like that.

125
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,303
- Fuck it, I don't want
to talk about it, man.

126
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:37,869
But guys, guys, what I
always wanted to know

127
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:40,951
is Carl, when you have a spontaneous fuck

128
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:42,901
with a nice chap right, how do you know

129
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:44,197
the mangina's shit-free?

130
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:46,849
No, not again; fuck bro!

131
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,549
- Every time we get together,

132
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,816
he starts with assholes and shit.

133
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:52,667
- He has a real deep anal fixation, right?

134
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,291
- No no, but seriously, like what happens?

135
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:59,458
You guys are horny as fuck and
14 year old rapists, right?

136
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,003
And then what?

137
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:02,836
Oh no wait.

138
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,915
No, wait, wait, stop!

139
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:09,881
I gotta clean my asshole with an enema.

140
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,823
- Here we go, I can see
- wonderful image.

141
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:14,673
- 14 year old rapist, really?

142
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:15,506
Why?

143
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,523
- No, but seriously guys.

144
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:21,973
Oh no, wait, I know what happens.

145
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:25,972
Do you take like a laxative
a couple of hours before?

146
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:27,654
Oh no wait, you do some
drill testing, right?

147
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:28,896
You do some drill testing.

148
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:30,070
- Be serious and stop.

149
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,686
I'm totally beginning to think
you're a homophobe, alright?

150
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:34,912
- Of course, yeah, and
that's why me and Carl

151
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:38,026
have been friends forever and
we run a shop together, right.

152
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,998
Oh and by the way, you've never told me

153
00:09:39,998 --> 00:09:41,544
if you're a top or bottom.

154
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:43,430
- And you will never find out.

155
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,808
- They should make a pill
for your homophobia, bro.

156
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,475
- Speaking of pills,

157
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:49,840
alright I just read the
latest placebo research.

158
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,488
It's actually pretty interesting.

159
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,105
- Yeah, yeah, nice way
to change the topic.

160
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:58,508
- Anyway, so listen, people
with chronic back pain, alright,

161
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:00,684
were giving a placebo pill and
if they trust their doctor,

162
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,442
the back pain was cured,
no pain whatsoever.

163
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,838
- You mean just like a sugar pill?

164
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,277
It's like a

165
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:08,874
- But they knew it was a placebo?

166
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,588
- No no no, it worked either way.

167
00:10:13,377 --> 00:10:14,210
- Wonderful.

168
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,043
Alright fellas, good seeing you guys.

169
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:16,215
Have a good night.

170
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,747
Carl, see you tomorrow, alright?

171
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:18,580
- Alright.

172
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,339
Take care, man.

173
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,589
- See ya at the shop, Carl.

174
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:26,857
- Anyway, Jacob I gotta go.

175
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:30,889
- No no, wait Max, I got
something to tell you.

176
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:33,049
Alright, I have a brilliant idea.

177
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,216
- Yeah, right.

178
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:37,892
- Yeah and fuck you too, okay.

179
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:42,059
- You know, I was thinking,
what if we told Athena

180
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,653
that you have this new drug for migraines.

181
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:46,988
- Say what?

182
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:49,613
- Placebo, bro, alright.

183
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:51,861
We'll tell her it's this
new experimental drug,

184
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,780
not FDA approved, yada yada yada.

185
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,079
- This sounds really not like--

186
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,992
- Wait, wait, and here comes the kicker:

187
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,409
You're gonna tell her it's a,

188
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:07,690
she'll have this insane desire
for constant sex, alright,

189
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,107
an exploding libido, alright.

190
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,071
Dude think about it.
- You're crazy.

191
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:14,321
No way, no way.

192
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:16,243
No way.

193
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,636
- Max listen, think about
the fucking field study

194
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,311
you can make of this.

195
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,770
This can be the solution, man.

196
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,595
- It's ludicrous, it's
unethical, it's plain wrong.

197
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:26,196
You've got some major
malfunctions up there bro, okay.

198
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:27,779
No way, I gotta go.

199
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:31,759
- But Max, I'm sorry, alright.

200
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,620
Wait, I gotta explain.
- There's nothing to explain.

201
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,666
Just let it go, okay.

202
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,546
I'm not gonna do anything evil
to Athena or anybody, okay?

203
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,842
I've gotta go.

204
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:41,647
- Dude, I'm serious.

205
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:44,730
I'm just embarrassed to say it, okay.

206
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:47,796
Athena wants to break up.

207
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:50,361
- Really?

208
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,528
- Yeah, we had an argument

209
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:58,648
and she basically said she
doesn't see a future, man.

210
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:02,126
- That's not good.

211
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:03,543
I mean I'm sorry.

212
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:06,054
It's kinda understandable considering

213
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:07,218
what kind of boyfriend you are,

214
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:08,463
but it's still not good; I'm sorry.

215
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:12,226
- I mean, of course, but
when I'm with you guys,

216
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:15,869
you know, I'm all macho and stuff,

217
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,952
but dude, when I'm alone,

218
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,665
I cry in my pillow, man.

219
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:25,904
Yeah.

220
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,382
- You guys have been
together for six years

221
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:44,123
and I've seen so many changes in you,

222
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:46,950
and not all for the better.

223
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:53,301
I mean, you used to love to cook,

224
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:56,554
new recipes,

225
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,283
great culinary feasts.

226
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:05,794
No offense, darling.

227
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:10,367
- Sorry Mom, next time
I'll cook you real food.

228
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,367
- Oh Honey, I'm kidding,

229
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,325
but I'm serious about your hobbies,

230
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,492
your passions,

231
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:21,694
the way you used to paint,

232
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,801
dance for hours on end on the weekends.

233
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,482
Now on top of everything,
you've gotta come here

234
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:31,462
and take care of me every day.

235
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:33,893
- Stop it, Mom; you know I love you

236
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:36,289
and I would do anything for you.

237
00:13:36,289 --> 00:13:38,008
We don't have money for a nurse.

238
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:39,341
- I know, Honey.

239
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:44,704
I just feel bad that you gotta
spend so much time over here.

240
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:50,290
If only your spoiled sister would step up.

241
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,719
She doesn't even visit anymore.

242
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,178
- She has final exams.

243
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:55,011
- Pfft!

244
00:13:56,645 --> 00:14:01,086
- Anyway, I think all my
issues are from my migraines.

245
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:04,586
They're draining me out, and my sex drive,

246
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,266
it wasn't hot to begin with.

247
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,277
- Then maybe you need to think about

248
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:15,610
when your migraines started.

249
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,135
Sweetie Puss?

250
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,010
You know, I'm sorry.

251
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,010
I really am.

252
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:39,863
I know I should be more understanding.

253
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:44,810
- I'm sorry I slapped your dick.

254
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,860
- Yeah, that was a
brand-new experience, huh?

255
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,268
- I know you liked it.

256
00:14:51,268 --> 00:14:53,859
- I love you, Sweetie Puss.

257
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,776
- I love you too, Fish.

258
00:14:58,717 --> 00:15:02,431
- I was just talking to Max and he said

259
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:06,281
he had this new experimental
drug for migraines.

260
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,460
- You know, I've tried everything.

261
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,802
- This worked on like
the most extreme cases.

262
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:12,458
- Really?

263
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,777
- This looks like the real deal,

264
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:17,964
the real shit, you know what I'm saying?

265
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:19,423
- I don't know.

266
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:21,090
I'll think about it.

267
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,830
Maybe I'll talk to him.

268
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:51,172
- Yes, because they're experimental

269
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:56,018
and they wanna test the
reactions and the side effects.

270
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:57,488
- Which are?

271
00:15:57,488 --> 00:16:00,228
- Ha, well that's a
bit of a caveat really.

272
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:04,957
In some of the test
subjects, they've experienced

273
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:09,040
restlessness, uber-high
energy and sleeplessness.

274
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,846
- That's not so bad.

275
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:16,275
- Well there is another side effect, yeah.

276
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:21,311
- Fuck Max, don't keep me on tender hooks.

277
00:16:21,311 --> 00:16:23,478
- Well, you may experience

278
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,270
an elevated libido.

279
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:32,495
- Haha, that will be the day.

280
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:33,685
Anything else?

281
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:34,518
- No, no.

282
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:40,851
Well, actually yes.

283
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,879
I mean, yes.

284
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:48,715
It's not just an increased libido.

285
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:52,728
Some of the other subjects,
especially the female ones

286
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,978
have experienced an extreme

287
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:57,821
lust for sex,

288
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,334
a constant need for sex,

289
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:05,502
craving for sex all day long, just sex,

290
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:06,961
sex,

291
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,849
sex, sex, all day long,

292
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,682
sex,

293
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:11,504
sex.

294
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,698
- Huh.

295
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,788
And you're saying all these subjects

296
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,538
have no migraines after
taking just one pill?

297
00:17:27,602 --> 00:17:29,783
- I don't know if I would
take the pill, Honey,

298
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:32,051
especially 'cause it's so experimental.

299
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,582
I don't know, maybe try
it for a couple of days

300
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:34,946
and see how you feel.

301
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,092
- Fuck sis, if I had headaches every day,

302
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,478
I would most def try it.
- Lady.

303
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,263
- Yummy.

304
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:44,957
- Yeah 'cause that's
what some ladies told me

305
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:48,624
after getting the special
Anthony treatment.

306
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:54,434
- Wow, you should really be a porn star.

307
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:57,098
- This is just the beginning, look.

308
00:17:57,098 --> 00:18:00,497
- Yeah Baby, show me what you got.

309
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,900
- Okay, okay, I see we're
talking with talent okay,

310
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,743
but see, Helen and Susan over here,

311
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,160
they're lesbians,

312
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:10,698
and Lola over there,

313
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,343
she has big dick,

314
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,050
and I'm married sand have four kids.

315
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,451
- What the fuck did you
bitches do to Anthony?

316
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:31,130
- Okay girls, I think it's time.

317
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,282
- Yeah.

318
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:34,188
- What, what the fuck happened?

319
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:37,486
My god.

320
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:40,847
- That was crazy.
- Did you see?

321
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:44,264
Come on.

322
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:49,178
- You wanna end up like
this guy back there?

323
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,602
- What do you mean?

324
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:52,327
- That's how all men are, no?

325
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:53,333
Always thinking about sex,

326
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,872
and therefore, they have no other brain

327
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:57,839
to be left for anything else, right?

328
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,200
And as you said, this is
the biggest side effect

329
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,033
of your migraine pill,

330
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:04,652
a crazy libido.

331
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:08,945
I mean you don't even know if
this is the worse side effect.

332
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:13,194
You could become suicidal,
or even homicidal, right?

333
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:08,720
- Oh wow, Sweetie Puss, I don't remember

334
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,384
the last time you made breakfast.

335
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:43,924
- Hey Baby.

336
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,993
- Hey, Sweetie Puss.

337
00:21:45,993 --> 00:21:48,821
- I love it hard and wide, Baby.

338
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:49,954
- Alright.

339
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,395
- Gee Athena, are you okay?

340
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:16,820
- Susan, I can invade a small country

341
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,886
in a bikini with an AK-47
and become fucking queen

342
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:21,648
by the end of the day.

343
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,198
- I'm so happy for you.

344
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:24,741
- I mean it's not just the energy,

345
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:27,408
headaches are gone, migraines are gone.

346
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,834
It's all fucking unbelievable; I love it.

347
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,368
- Aw Sweetie.

348
00:22:31,368 --> 00:22:33,005
- We fucked like three times this morning.

349
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:34,298
- Good for you.

350
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:37,526
- And I rubbed carpet twice since then.

351
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:40,493
- Wow, so it really is true
about the side effects.

352
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,528
- And I'm in heat like a fucking dog.

353
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,192
I mean, you see this guy?

354
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:47,062
I'll go to fuck him until
he kicks the bucket.

355
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:48,501
- Oh eww, Athena, that's disgusting.

356
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,416
- And I'll still fuck him nonstop.

357
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:52,731
- Oh my god!

358
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,459
- 'Til rigor mortis dissipates.

359
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,960
- Okay stop, stop, I can't
listen to this anymore.

360
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,199
- Three days later.

361
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,534
- You're gonna make me pee my pants.

362
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:04,429
- Panties are so soaked
from my coochie dripping

363
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:07,179
like a fucking leaking honey pot.

364
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,930
- Holy shit.

365
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,953
- Fuck it, I'm going to the bathroom

366
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:14,475
visiting funny fingers.

367
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:35,502
Pale lord.

368
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:53,088
- No worries, Sir, it's just our TV.

369
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:58,753
- Yeah, sounds like one of
those nasty titty films.

370
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,138
Hey Athena, all good?

371
00:24:23,138 --> 00:24:24,055
- All good.

372
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:32,345
Sir, would you like anything else?

373
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,988
It's crazy, I never
ever felt so pumped up.

374
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:44,876
It's the best shit ever happened to me.

375
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,814
The problem is I have too much energy,

376
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:56,145
and of course insatiable lust for sex

377
00:24:56,145 --> 00:24:57,478
all of the time.

378
00:24:58,468 --> 00:25:00,681
It's strange, but I'm loving it.

379
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,841
- Maybe you should try
some yoga or Pilates,

380
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,804
you know, something to calm down.

381
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,385
- Yes, that's a good idea.

382
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:07,900
- No, with a bunch of pretentious bitches?

383
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,029
Nah.

384
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:10,185
- Hey, I do Pilates.

385
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:11,018
- Exactly.

386
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:14,956
- I know, we should try Zoomba.

387
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:16,089
- What's that?

388
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:17,865
- It's this fitness program in which

389
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:20,409
you go over Latin American dance moves.

390
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:21,902
- Sounds interesting.

391
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:23,269
- Sounds better.

392
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:25,102
Let's try it tomorrow?

393
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,004
- Hey I need a break.

394
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:41,405
I need a break.

395
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:44,088
- You okay, man?

396
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:44,921
- Yeah.

397
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:49,680
I don't know if I'm
gonna survive the sting.

398
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:54,893
So how are things going
with you and Athena?

399
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,370
- Oh great man, yeah.

400
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,936
You know, she's always
energetic; she's very happy.

401
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:06,060
Oh yeah, and she doesn't talk
about breaking up anymore.

402
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,991
- That's good to here, Jacob.

403
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:10,197
It's good to hear.

404
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:12,770
So, how's the other thing?

405
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,824
You know, if you don't mind me asking.

406
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:15,657
- What?

407
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,556
The fucking?

408
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,380
Oh man.
- Yes.

409
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,055
She's not going crazy is she?

410
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:23,143
- No no no man, I'm telling
you, she's a machine.

411
00:26:23,143 --> 00:26:24,314
We fuck like crazy.

412
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:28,481
In fact, dude, I can't even
keep it up sometimes, alright.

413
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:32,385
You know Max, I was thinking,

414
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,256
can we like probably tweak
it down a little bit?

415
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:39,564
Yeah man, it's like,
you'll just tell her that,

416
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,202
you know, it's, the
side effects are just a,

417
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,639
temporary, you know, and that in time,

418
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,322
she'll just, it will go
down, you know, her libido.

419
00:26:49,322 --> 00:26:52,952
- Jacob, Jacob, stop
complaining, man, okay.

420
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:54,847
A placebo can be a powerful thing.

421
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,840
I did you a favor, now
you have to deal with it.

422
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,532
I'm not gonna tell her anything, okay.

423
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:02,244
You just have to deal with it

424
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:03,650
until we finish the experiment, okay,

425
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,835
which I hope is gonna be soon.

426
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:08,613
- Woah woah woah, wait a second, man.

427
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:12,113
You don't gotta wet your panties, alright.

428
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:33,987
Damn.

429
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:43,004
- Hola, Senor, como esta?

430
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:46,948
Senor, you're very very dirty.

431
00:27:48,025 --> 00:27:49,775
I must clean you now.

432
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:24,895
- Four steps back

433
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:26,513
and back in the center.

434
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:30,041
And some jumping jacks

435
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,624
and one, two three, cooling off

436
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:36,003
and that's it, guys.

437
00:28:36,003 --> 00:28:39,086
Good workout, give yourselves a hand.

438
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:43,291
Awesome.

439
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,333
Such a great class, isn't it?

440
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:46,274
- It was awesome; I'm
glad you worked it out.

441
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:47,357
- Yeah, yeah.

442
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,177
- It was awesome.

443
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:52,454
- Cool, you guys new to the class, right?

444
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:53,927
- Yeah, first time.

445
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:54,760
Great workout.

446
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,595
I'm Helen, this is
Athena, Susan, and Lola.

447
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:57,428
- Hi.

448
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:00,357
- You look like you had fun,

449
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:02,464
but you, Athena right?

450
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:04,205
You've done Zoomba before right?

451
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:05,776
I mean you,

452
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,000
you're a professional dancer?

453
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,886
- No actually, I'm the opposite,

454
00:29:08,886 --> 00:29:10,816
more of a couch potato.

455
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:11,649
- A couch potato?

456
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:12,482
I never would have guessed.

457
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:14,640
I mean you've got great
moves, lots of stamina.

458
00:29:15,976 --> 00:29:19,726
- Oh yeah, Athena, she's
got lots of stamina.

459
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:24,994
- Okay, nice to have met
you ladies, okay bye.

460
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:30,194
- So Honey, how are you doing?

461
00:29:30,194 --> 00:29:32,624
How are your exams going?

462
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:34,189
- Good, I can't complain.

463
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,918
I've got one last exam, and
then I'm officially a paralegal.

464
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,696
- I'm so proud of you.

465
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,613
- Good job.

466
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:46,106
- Thank you, Honey.

467
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:53,312
- Now, I completely forgot you can cook.

468
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:54,496
It's marvelous.

469
00:29:54,496 --> 00:29:55,649
- How's your love life?

470
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:57,233
Anybody we should know about?

471
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,650
- No, not really.

472
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,431
Well, there kinda is.

473
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,480
- What the fuck does that mean.

474
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,784
- I'm having an affair, okay.

475
00:30:07,784 --> 00:30:10,985
- Oh, we got a little devil here.

476
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:13,002
- He's married and has kids.

477
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:15,541
What can I say, I'm the cliche mistress

478
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:16,673
waiting for him top leave his wife.

479
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:19,923
- Fuck and you didn't tell me about it?

480
00:30:21,644 --> 00:30:24,644
- How long have you been canoodling?

481
00:30:25,772 --> 00:30:27,718
- I don't know exactly.

482
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:31,535
It doesn't matter; I'm not
sure about him anymore anyway.

483
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:33,368
- Oh Honey, I'm sorry,

484
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,339
but you know, you're a pretty,
intelligent young woman.

485
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,820
There's gotta be a nice, normal,

486
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,428
decent guy out there for you.

487
00:30:42,428 --> 00:30:44,500
- You can't help who you
fall for; it's how it is.

488
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,191
- I'm still shocked that
you kept this dark secret.

489
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:51,556
You have to tell me all about him.

490
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:53,447
- The truth is I'm more
concerned about you.

491
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:55,083
- Why?

492
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,721
- You're not yourself anymore,

493
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,487
and I can't help but wonder

494
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:01,904
if this drug isn't doing you some damage.

495
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:06,859
- No need to worry; I've
got it under control.

496
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,276
I feel fantastic.

497
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,049
There are no negative side effects.

498
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:14,491
- Yeah, what's the issue, Honey?

499
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:17,824
- I just have a bad feeling, that's all.

500
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:32,929
- Hey, Sweetie Puss, how'd it go?

501
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:36,327
- Good, but not as good as your dick.

502
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,894
- Woah, Sweetie Puss, wait, wait.

503
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:39,868
You know what?

504
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:43,736
How 'bout you let me finish this game,

505
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,935
and after that, I'm gonna fuck you so hard

506
00:31:45,935 --> 00:31:48,935
you won't be able to sit for a week.

507
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:52,903
- I hope that's a promise.

508
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,296
So I asked if he's be serious.

509
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:17,595
- And?

510
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:20,711
- And he says, "Yes,
of course I'm serious."

511
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:23,673
We should nuke Africa and all
the other loser countries,

512
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,334
Problem solved.

513
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,438
- Holy fuck, where did
you find this loser?

514
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:30,647
And on top of everything,
he expected me to pay,

515
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:34,031
and he expected me to take
him to my place to fuck.

516
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,471
- Oh, and did you?

517
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:36,804
- Are you crazy?

518
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:41,606
I would have rather fucked
a granny in a wheelchair.

519
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:42,921
- But he was hot?

520
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:46,004
- Yeah, killer features, killer body,

521
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:52,177
a real fucking Adonis
until he opened his mouth.

522
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,815
Ignorance is so unattractive.

523
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:58,814
- Absolutamente.

524
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:04,026
- Sweetie, are you okay?

525
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,238
Holy shit, Sweetie.

526
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:08,644
- Can I talk to you in private?

527
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:09,727
- Yeah, yeah.

528
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:17,519
Feel okay, Sweetie Puss?

529
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,353
- I'm in pain; it hurts so much.

530
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:21,547
- Where, your head?

531
00:33:21,547 --> 00:33:22,449
- No.

532
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:25,185
- It hurts so much over here.

533
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:26,137
- What the fuck, Sweetie Puss?

534
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,649
I thought something bad happened?

535
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:30,491
- Come on, Fish, don't
be a pussy; stick it in.

536
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:32,112
Destroy me, come on.

537
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:33,534
- I don't got time for this!

538
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:35,694
I'm working as you can see.

539
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:39,397
- Are you fucking serious?

540
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:41,324
You're gonna really let me hang with this?

541
00:33:41,324 --> 00:33:43,842
- We fuck like a million times
a day and it's not enough?

542
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:45,625
- Oh, that's how it is?

543
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,771
When you wanted to fuck, it didn't matter

544
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:49,407
if I was in the mood or not, right fucker?

545
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:51,490
- I'm gonna get a coffee.

546
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,422
- I gotta finish this
t-shirt like by tomorrow

547
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:56,005
for a client, okay?

548
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:58,820
- Screw you, limp dick.

549
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:09,279
- Hi there; what can I get you guys?

550
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:12,083
- Two vodka tonics and two Merlot.

551
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,333
- Can I see some ID please?

552
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,810
Really?

553
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,387
Your name's Athena Cockburn?

554
00:34:20,387 --> 00:34:21,793
Cockburn?

555
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,618
- Dude, I hear this all my life.

556
00:34:24,618 --> 00:34:27,337
It's pronounced Co-burn.

557
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:31,441
- Okay, alright, didn't
mean to offend, Co-burn.

558
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:33,039
The way you look, I wouldn't be surprised

559
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,761
if your name wasn't a
prophecy for most men.

560
00:34:35,761 --> 00:34:37,702
- Only the ones who are worth it.

561
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,485
- That's good to know.

562
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:40,318
I'm Gavin.

563
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,323
- We need to change our last name.

564
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:50,214
- Or get married.

565
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,374
- And have a lot of kids.

566
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:11,319
Unbelievable.

567
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,559
- Who the fuck would have thought that?

568
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:17,148
- He's very interesting fish.

569
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:17,981
- Can always stick it

570
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:19,906
Yeah.

571
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:22,297
- That's what makes him hot.

572
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:24,817
- Nah, and he could be your father.

573
00:35:24,817 --> 00:35:28,705
- Still, you know, there's
something intriguing

574
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:30,865
and mysterious about him.

575
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:39,491
So how's Jacob?

576
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:41,075
- Good.

577
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:42,731
- Any fights lately?

578
00:35:42,731 --> 00:35:43,814
- Not really.

579
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:47,050
Look, Fish just doesn't wanna fuck enough.

580
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,639
It is becoming a vaginal issue.

581
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,225
I don't know how long I can hold it back

582
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:54,591
before I jump fuck the next passing dick.

583
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:55,763
- Hell, why don't you do it with somebody?

584
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:56,966
- What?

585
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:58,878
- I mean, you don't have to tell him.

586
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:01,628
- You really surprised me lately.

587
00:36:03,251 --> 00:36:07,950
- Hey, maybe I'm just maturing
and becoming more realistic,

588
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,927
or pragmatic depending
on how you look at it.

589
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:15,035
- No, I could never do that?

590
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:17,779
Well, I hope so.

591
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,554
- Hello, ladies.

592
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:33,635
I guess Jersey City is a
village after all, huh?

593
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:36,567
- And you must be the village jester,

594
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:39,390
you know, singing and dancing.

595
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,691
You must tell jokes too.

596
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:43,393
- No, no jokes, and I'm
very bad at telling jokes.

597
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:46,398
- Are there any talents
or other professions

598
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:48,300
we should know about?

599
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,634
Maybe some secrets?

600
00:36:49,634 --> 00:36:50,555
- No secrets.

601
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:53,719
Well actually, I do have
a couple of women chained

602
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,595
in my basement because I
do enjoy the occasional

603
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:58,845
human filet mignon in a red wine sauce.

604
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:02,219
It's a joke.

605
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,851
I told you, I'm very bad
at telling jokes, okay.

606
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:10,460
Hey, why don't you let
me buy you a drink, okay?

607
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,293
- Sure.

608
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:13,235
Thank you.

609
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,063
- Hey, I'm having a party
at my place next week.

610
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,485
You guys wanna come?

611
00:37:47,485 --> 00:37:48,908
My friend, Theo, is coming.

612
00:37:48,908 --> 00:37:51,677
- Oh yes, thank you for the invite.

613
00:37:51,677 --> 00:37:53,177
We'd love to come.

614
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,837
- You okay?

615
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,323
- Of course.

616
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:01,573
Are you doing anything, like right now?

617
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:08,278
I think we can go to your place,

618
00:38:09,434 --> 00:38:10,517
and you know?

619
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:13,254
- Oh okay, I get it.

620
00:38:13,254 --> 00:38:16,076
No, actually I really have to get up

621
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:18,993
very early tomorrow and go to work.

622
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,498
- Sure.

623
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:24,467
No problem.

624
00:38:45,296 --> 00:38:46,374
Holy fuck!

625
00:38:46,374 --> 00:38:47,207
More!

626
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,451
More!

627
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,284
Come on!

628
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,019
Fuck!

629
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:01,334
- Place,

630
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:04,355
deep breath,

631
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:05,522
and that's it.

632
00:39:07,288 --> 00:39:10,364
Thank you, great workout everybody.

633
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:11,771
Athena, do you have a moment.

634
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:12,819
- Victor, listen.

635
00:39:12,819 --> 00:39:14,291
- I just, look.

636
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,745
- Victor, I told you I was drunk, okay.

637
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:16,770
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,053
Let's just stay friends
and not mention this again.

639
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:20,373
- I'm sorry, okay.

640
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:22,729
I'm just not used to this kind of thing.

641
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:24,419
- What do you mean?

642
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:25,878
- Dating and stuff.

643
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:28,029
I apologize, okay again.

644
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:30,999
I just wanted to come
over for a drink and chat.

645
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,841
I'm not a one-night-stand type of guy.

646
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:34,993
I'm not saying you are either.

647
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:36,491
I'm just saying,

648
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:38,704
you know, I'm not used to getting offers

649
00:39:38,704 --> 00:39:41,008
from beautiful young women.

650
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:43,777
I just want to get to know you better.

651
00:39:43,777 --> 00:39:44,610
Please.

652
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:47,703
Please.

653
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:51,870
- You're not going to chain
me in the basement, are you?

654
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:57,048
- Hi.

655
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,432
- Holy shit, Fish.

656
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:02,423
What is your third job?

657
00:40:02,423 --> 00:40:03,590
A drug dealer?

658
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,208
- I used to manage a hedge fund.

659
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:09,520
It's along time ago, back in the 90's.

660
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,680
- So bank stuff?

661
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,264
Are you rich?

662
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:15,549
- Well, let's just say that
this condo's very modest

663
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:17,440
compared to the house I used to live in,

664
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,190
but I can't complain.

665
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,264
- And why did you stop robbing people?

666
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:25,192
- I actually had a burn-out,

667
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:28,077
so I just took all my
money and left Manhattan.

668
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:32,268
- And now you are a singer
and a Zoomba teacher.

669
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:34,185
- Yeah maybe, in a way.

670
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,337
Would you like some white wine?

671
00:40:36,337 --> 00:40:37,851
- Sure.

672
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:50,264
- Thank you.

673
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,042
Who's this?

674
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:55,420
- Oh, that's,

675
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:57,950
that's my sister.

676
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:01,105
- She's beautiful.

677
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,121
- Yeah, she was.

678
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:06,164
She passed a long time ago.

679
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:08,325
- I'm so sorry to hear about that.

680
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:10,772
- Yeah well, that's life.

681
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:12,232
Would you like to sit?

682
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:13,065
- Sure.

683
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:16,245
- Are you okay?

684
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:20,453
You're not uncomfortable
here with me, right?

685
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:21,286
- I'm so sorry.

686
00:41:21,286 --> 00:41:22,704
I have so much shit going
on right now in my life,

687
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:25,537
and I did things I'm not proud of.

688
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:28,703
- Oh?

689
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:32,280
- Actually, I'm very
comfortable around you,

690
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,102
and I feel like I can talk
to you about anything.

691
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:35,685
- Great, same here.

692
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,394
- I cheated on my boyfriend.

693
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:43,351
- Okay.

694
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:45,295
- Just so atypical of me.

695
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,348
I've never done anything like this.

696
00:41:48,348 --> 00:41:51,844
Now I'm full of guilt and
I don't know what to do.

697
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:55,284
- I mean, where you guys having issues

698
00:41:55,284 --> 00:41:58,236
or did you just fall in
love with somebody else?

699
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:00,569
- No, it was one time thing,

700
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:07,572
and I mean I don't know if
I should tell my boyfriend.

701
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:09,072
What would you do?

702
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,244
- Well let me ask you this.

703
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:13,581
If your boyfriend cheated on you,

704
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:15,799
would you want to know?

705
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,799
- Hell Yeah.

706
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,368
- Then maybe that's your answer.

707
00:42:28,471 --> 00:42:31,155
- I gotta tell Jacob;
it's driving me nuts.

708
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:33,727
- What if he breaks up with you?

709
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:37,186
- It's not my fault; it's that damn pill.

710
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:38,669
- Maybe.

711
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:39,965
- The fuck you mean maybe?

712
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:41,563
- Look, don't get snippy with me.

713
00:42:41,563 --> 00:42:44,623
You guys haven't exactly been, you know.

714
00:42:44,623 --> 00:42:45,992
- What?

715
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:47,597
- You have been complaining
about this relationship

716
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:48,930
for a long time.

717
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,394
- Yeah I know, babe.

718
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:53,515
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be a bitch.

719
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:57,187
Maybe that's more a reason I
need to come clean with him.

720
00:42:57,187 --> 00:42:58,378
Maybe.

721
00:42:58,378 --> 00:43:02,086
I can't wait until I get it over with.

722
00:43:02,086 --> 00:43:03,438
Would you mind if I leave?

723
00:43:03,438 --> 00:43:05,991
There's not much going on.

724
00:43:05,991 --> 00:43:07,908
- Sure Honey, go ahead.

725
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,796
I can handle it here.

726
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,546
- Thank you, Babe; I owe you one.

727
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:18,416
Fish?

728
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:22,320
Fish, are you here?

729
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:27,704
Fish?

730
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:31,537
Fish, I...

731
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:37,541
- Wow.

732
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:40,283
Wow.

733
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:42,390
I guess it makes us even now.

734
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:43,973
- What did you say?

735
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:46,727
- Look, I'm sorry, okay.

736
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:47,727
I was drunk.

737
00:43:49,283 --> 00:43:51,367
Hey lady, you can come out now, it's okay.

738
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,797
- Did you fucking cheat on me?

739
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,542
- Look, I'm not mad at you, okay.

740
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,228
We had a rough patch.

741
00:43:57,228 --> 00:43:59,989
We both fucked up; let's
just forget about this.

742
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:02,098
Yo lady, it's okay to come out, really.

743
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:05,015
Okay, I'm going to leave right now.

744
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:10,326
By the time I come back, that
slut has to be gone, okay?

745
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:13,331
- Oh ho ho, now you call me a slut, huh?

746
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:14,790
- Wait Sweetie Puss, don't
make this harder, okay?

747
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,751
- Fucking bitch, what about you?

748
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:18,926
Oh you're not the holy
Athena now anymore, are you?

749
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:20,044
- Woah, woah!

750
00:44:20,044 --> 00:44:21,645
Shut up, Sweetie Puss.

751
00:44:21,645 --> 00:44:23,099
- You said you wanted to
break up with her anyway,

752
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:24,274
didn't you?

753
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:26,343
- You fucking, conniving asshole!

754
00:44:26,343 --> 00:44:29,197
And you, Helen, you fucking traitor!

755
00:44:29,197 --> 00:44:31,247
I'm going to fucking kill you both!

756
00:44:31,247 --> 00:44:32,330
- Woah, woah.

757
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:34,579
- And you, Helen!

758
00:44:37,607 --> 00:44:38,773
- Oh my god.

759
00:44:40,991 --> 00:44:41,887
- Woah!

760
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:42,720
Woah!

761
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,553
Oh my god!

762
00:44:43,553 --> 00:44:44,386
- I'm done with you both.

763
00:44:44,386 --> 00:44:45,632
I'm through, you hear me!

764
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:46,465
I'm done!

765
00:45:31,152 --> 00:45:33,312
- Excuse me, miss.

766
00:45:33,312 --> 00:45:35,799
Sorry to interrupt you.

767
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,906
Is this place occupied?

768
00:45:37,906 --> 00:45:40,149
- Sure, I don't own this bench.

769
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:42,960
You can sit if you'd like.

770
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,902
- You are so kind.

771
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:48,819
Most people are so
detached, so self-contained.

772
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:54,624
They're even afraid of us
involuntarily

773
00:45:54,624 --> 00:45:55,624
but not you.

774
00:45:56,822 --> 00:45:59,919
You are a ray of light in this dark world.

775
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:00,752
- Thanks.

776
00:46:04,632 --> 00:46:08,382
- What a wonderful day
it is today, isn't it?

777
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,558
- Yes it is.

778
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:21,349
- I've been on these hooves all day,

779
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:22,932
and they're so dry.

780
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:38,023
I'm sorry, may I offer you some lotion?

781
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:39,023
- No thanks.

782
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:45,617
- It's very important to
take care of your body

783
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:47,950
and your soul too of course.

784
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,109
- Absolutely.

785
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:56,709
Well, I gotta go; have a wonderful day.

786
00:46:58,312 --> 00:46:59,395
- Young lady?

787
00:47:00,381 --> 00:47:02,703
Thank you so much.

788
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:04,786
You are a wonderful lady.

789
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,239
May all your wishes
come true in your life.

790
00:47:11,805 --> 00:47:12,638
Can you believe your own sister

791
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:15,009
would do something like that?

792
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:17,439
- Well, if I had one and she did,

793
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:20,175
I'd rip her heart out, barbecue it

794
00:47:20,175 --> 00:47:22,695
and eat it like a pork chop.

795
00:47:22,695 --> 00:47:25,738
Look, I can't understand exactly
what you're going through,

796
00:47:25,738 --> 00:47:28,330
but Helen really disappointed me too.

797
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,497
I had no idea she could be
such a treacherous person.

798
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:35,950
- Holy moly!

799
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:38,602
Are these from you?

800
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:39,435
- Yeah.

801
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:43,734
- They're freaking amazing;
you never showed me.

802
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:45,350
You're so talented.

803
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,538
- I don't know.

804
00:47:46,538 --> 00:47:47,694
I guess.

805
00:47:47,694 --> 00:47:50,154
Did I tell you I
started again.

806
00:47:50,154 --> 00:47:52,987
- Actually no, but that's awesome.

807
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:56,130
- Since I had so much
energy and I couldn't sleep

808
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,977
for the past few weeks,
I've been working so crazy.

809
00:47:58,977 --> 00:48:00,810
- Yeah, but you don't have any headaches.

810
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:02,518
- True, that's the only reason

811
00:48:02,518 --> 00:48:06,374
I'm still taking those freaking pills.

812
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:10,312
How about you and I, we do a show together

813
00:48:10,312 --> 00:48:11,898
and you will say yes.

814
00:48:11,898 --> 00:48:12,731
- What?

815
00:48:13,606 --> 00:48:14,687
- You have to start taking risks,

816
00:48:14,687 --> 00:48:16,617
otherwise nothing will happen.

817
00:48:16,617 --> 00:48:18,180
- What I want to know about is Victor.

818
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,097
How was it?

819
00:48:20,215 --> 00:48:23,382
- He's cute, but he's more of a loner.

820
00:48:24,229 --> 00:48:27,562
- What I mean is did you guys, you know?

821
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:31,425
- No, he's very reserved.

822
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:35,029
I would say very conservative,

823
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:38,949
but a very very good friend,

824
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,914
an unfuckable friend.

825
00:48:40,914 --> 00:48:43,266
I need to get over Jacob.

826
00:48:43,266 --> 00:48:45,286
The only way is

827
00:48:45,286 --> 00:48:46,703
through my pussy.

828
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:52,631
Ah, I need a drink and a fuck.

829
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:53,782
Let's go to a bar.

830
00:48:53,782 --> 00:48:57,258
- Oh Honey, I'm so tired and
I'm really not in the mood.

831
00:48:57,258 --> 00:49:00,258
- Alright, well I'm gonna go change,

832
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:04,492
and don't wait up for me.

833
00:50:26,092 --> 00:50:30,067
♫ Turned on by a sigh

834
00:50:30,067 --> 00:50:33,234
♫ Mona Lisa Mona Lisa

♫ Simple hands

848
00:51:37,202 --> 00:51:39,775
- She was even more
beautiful in real life.

849
00:51:39,775 --> 00:51:41,193
- I can only imagine.

850
00:51:41,193 --> 00:51:45,679
- Yeah, she was the kindest,
warmest person I ever met.

851
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:46,512
Victor,

852
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:50,261
Victor fell apart after she died.

853
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:54,391
He hasn't been in a relationship since.

854
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:56,296
- What do you mean?

855
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:58,328
- Charlotte, his wife,

856
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:01,025
after she died of a brain tumor.

857
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:02,692
Oh, you didn't know?

858
00:52:04,216 --> 00:52:05,799
- Oh course I knew.

859
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:14,091
- Excuse me.

860
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:19,808
- Hi, Theo.
- Hi.

861
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:22,847
- You have a voice like an angel.

862
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:24,613
- Oh, you do too.

863
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:27,219
And you're beautiful too.

864
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:29,360
- Well, thank you.

865
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,963
- I'm so stupid.

866
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:32,713
- No, don't be silly.

867
00:52:34,274 --> 00:52:36,994
- I just don't feel
comfortable talking about her.

868
00:52:36,994 --> 00:52:40,861
I know it's no excuse, but
she was the love of my life,

869
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:43,468
and when she passed, I just fell into this

870
00:52:43,468 --> 00:52:45,233
deep, dark place.

871
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:46,477
- I really understand, Victor.

872
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:49,050
I was just a bit
surprised when he told me.

873
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:52,550
I'm so sorry about your loss; I really am.

874
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:59,312
- Can I ask you a question?

875
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:00,145
- Sure.

876
00:53:01,165 --> 00:53:03,126
- You like creepy stuff, right?

877
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:05,269
- How did you know?

878
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,872
- You wanna go on a trip tomorrow?

879
00:53:06,872 --> 00:53:07,914
- Where to?

880
00:53:07,914 --> 00:53:08,997
- You'll see.

881
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:13,714
- Sure, I'd like to see
what you label creepy

882
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:16,861
Nothing with human flesh and chains.

883
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:35,114
Holy fuck, this is awesome!

884
00:53:36,123 --> 00:53:38,067
This is really a nice surprise.

885
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:40,280
I had a feeling you'd like it.

886
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,955
And why was this closed?

887
00:53:41,955 --> 00:53:43,611
Well you know,
so many places like this one

888
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:46,306
were closed because of,
you know, patient abuse

889
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:50,307
and overcrowding, unsafe
building materials.

890
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:54,355
- I read once; it all
started with JFK's sister,

891
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:55,635
had a lobotomy, right?

892
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:57,662
- Exactly, exactly.

893
00:53:57,662 --> 00:53:59,235
Right after Rosemary
Kennedy was lobotomized

894
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,194
and then JFK started looking
into places like this,

895
00:54:01,194 --> 00:54:03,229
you know, and shutting them down.

896
00:54:03,229 --> 00:54:05,912
He was for deinstitutionalization really.

897
00:54:05,912 --> 00:54:08,019
He just wanted to get people
out of places like this one

898
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:11,269
and put 'em into more humane locations.

899
00:54:13,472 --> 00:54:14,889
- De-Instinctive,

900
00:54:15,776 --> 00:54:16,776
what a word.

901
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,683
And meds help too.

902
00:54:19,683 --> 00:54:20,835
- Of course,

903
00:54:20,835 --> 00:54:22,938
but antidepressants weren't introduced

904
00:54:22,938 --> 00:54:27,258
until the 50s or 60s, and
that helped out a lot.

905
00:54:27,258 --> 00:54:30,085
I just love visiting places like this,

906
00:54:30,085 --> 00:54:33,252
you know, where people lived and died.

907
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,790
I don't know why I'm so attracted to them.

908
00:54:40,173 --> 00:54:42,204
- I just can't stand this.

909
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:44,057
It seems if you don't have
a big, successful life,

910
00:54:44,057 --> 00:54:45,677
you're a failure.

911
00:54:45,677 --> 00:54:47,642
You read it everywhere.

912
00:54:47,642 --> 00:54:50,234
You know, you have to make career, money,

913
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:52,256
get married, stay buff.

914
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:53,783
Once I read an article,

915
00:54:53,783 --> 00:54:56,089
you have to be stupid not
to strive for happiness.

916
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:57,439
- But I mean who defines happiness?

917
00:54:57,439 --> 00:54:58,272
Society?

918
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:01,418
And by the way, who defines
what's the right way to live?

919
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:03,955
That's how I felt about my old job.

920
00:55:03,955 --> 00:55:07,566
Everything was money,
success all the time.

921
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:09,511
- We can go further:

922
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:10,970
success is happiness.

923
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:12,573
This is why I feel so
bad for today's kids.

924
00:55:12,573 --> 00:55:16,461
Everyone wants to be musician or actor.

925
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:18,763
Everyone wants to be rich and famous.

926
00:55:18,763 --> 00:55:20,474
- There was time when people were happy

927
00:55:20,474 --> 00:55:23,153
just opening a little business in the town

928
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,548
they were born in, maybe
like a little bakery,

929
00:55:25,548 --> 00:55:27,108
had children.

930
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:28,806
They got married; that was it.

931
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:31,092
- Exactly, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

932
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:33,440
Why can't people be
happy with a modest life.

933
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,431
- Yeah, let less; you know, a little less,

934
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:36,617
but more quality of life.

935
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:38,705
Maybe there would be fewer divorces,

936
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:40,485
you know, more people spending time

937
00:55:40,485 --> 00:55:42,861
with their children
instead of their lovers.

938
00:55:45,655 --> 00:55:47,629
I'll be going away on a trip soon.

939
00:55:47,629 --> 00:55:48,490
Oh really?

940
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,811
Where to?

941
00:55:49,811 --> 00:55:51,646
- I don't know, I've
traveled most of the world,

942
00:55:51,646 --> 00:55:53,901
but I've never been to Russia or China,

943
00:55:53,901 --> 00:55:57,123
so I'm thinking of doing
he Trans-Siberian Express.

944
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:58,630
- By train?

945
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,217
- Yeah, it leads outta Moscow, right;

946
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:02,695
goes right through Mongolia
straight into Pyongyang.

947
00:56:02,695 --> 00:56:05,669
- Wow, that sounds mind-blowing.

948
00:56:05,669 --> 00:56:08,531
You know, I would love to travel.

949
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,604
It's not like I've been anywhere,

950
00:56:10,604 --> 00:56:13,354
but I actually never left the US.

951
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,672
I always dreamed of Europe:

952
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:17,672
Paris, Rome,

953
00:56:19,865 --> 00:56:21,365
Madrid, Amsterdam.

954
00:56:22,731 --> 00:56:24,512
How long will you be gone for?

955
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:26,691
- I don't like to rush when I travel.

956
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:29,009
I like to take in every little detail,

957
00:56:29,009 --> 00:56:31,280
you know, the people,
the food, the culture,

958
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,853
so I'm thinking I don't
know, about a year.

959
00:56:33,853 --> 00:56:34,686
- Oh wow.

960
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:37,923
I will miss you.

961
00:56:41,216 --> 00:56:43,755
I could never do a trip like that.

962
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:45,411
No money,

963
00:56:45,411 --> 00:56:46,904
job.

964
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,560
I take daily care of my mom.

965
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,637
She can barely walk or move.

966
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:53,074
- And you take care of her alone?

967
00:56:53,074 --> 00:56:54,873
- Yeah, I go there every evening;

968
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:58,423
sometimes during the day before my shift.

969
00:56:58,423 --> 00:57:01,337
You know, I love her;
it doesn't bother me.

970
00:57:01,337 --> 00:57:04,328
- That is really honorable of you.

971
00:57:04,328 --> 00:57:05,768
- Well, it's a freaking modest life

972
00:57:05,768 --> 00:57:08,390
that we were talking about right?

973
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,973
Incredibly satisfying.

974
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:26,883
You wanna come upstairs?

975
00:57:26,883 --> 00:57:31,050
- That was a wonderful kiss,
the best I had in a long time.

976
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:33,374
- Thank you.

977
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:36,341
- But the truth is that

978
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:39,392
I'm not ready yet.

979
00:57:39,392 --> 00:57:41,105
I mean honestly, I feel stupid saying no

980
00:57:41,105 --> 00:57:42,484
to a beauty like you, but I,

981
00:57:42,484 --> 00:57:44,144
I just need more time.

982
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:46,727
I hope you're not disappointed.

983
00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:50,264
- How could I, Victor?

984
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:52,045
You're a rare gentleman.

985
00:57:52,045 --> 00:57:55,160
I actually never met anyone like you.

986
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,888
Thank you for a wonderful day.

987
00:57:56,888 --> 00:57:59,888
I really enjoyed every second of it.

988
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,182
- Ha, you're in love!

989
00:58:14,182 --> 00:58:15,015
- No way!

990
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:19,005
I don't know, he's strange.

991
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:20,464
We didn't even fuck yet.

992
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,077
- Well, maybe that's a good thing.

993
00:58:23,077 --> 00:58:25,093
You know, touch a person's soul

994
00:58:25,093 --> 00:58:26,965
before you touch their body.

995
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:30,545
That's the way it's supposed to be, right?

996
00:58:30,545 --> 00:58:32,201
- In your fairy fantasy
world where having sex

997
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:35,134
means to stroke the wings of each other.

998
00:58:35,134 --> 00:58:38,158
I mean cum shot means sprinkling some

999
00:58:38,158 --> 00:58:40,303
fairy dust or some shit.

1000
00:58:40,303 --> 00:58:42,226
- Just make fun of me
'cause your own love life

1001
00:58:42,226 --> 00:58:44,459
is so wonderful, right?

1002
00:58:44,459 --> 00:58:47,033
- I don't need douchebags;
I just want their cocks.

1003
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:49,409
- That's exactly medicine
I need right now.

1004
00:58:49,409 --> 00:58:51,949
- Well, go and get it; what's the issue?

1005
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:54,142
- A couple of days ago, a stranger

1006
00:58:54,142 --> 00:58:56,717
approached me on the street.

1007
00:58:56,717 --> 00:58:57,550
- And?

1008
00:58:58,476 --> 00:59:00,989
- He asked me if I was the
girl that likes to fuck.

1009
00:59:02,613 --> 00:59:03,837
- What?

1010
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:05,999
- And then he asked if I wanna fuck him.

1011
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:09,525
- Oh holy shit, you are
officially the number one

1012
00:59:09,525 --> 00:59:11,613
Jersey City whore.

1013
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:13,178
- What did you say?

1014
00:59:13,178 --> 00:59:14,579
- I slapped him in the face.

1015
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:15,861
- Fuck yeah, and then?

1016
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:17,528
- Well, I was horny.

1017
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:20,268
What else was I supposed to do?

1018
00:59:20,268 --> 00:59:22,567
- No, you did not!

1019
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:24,679
You are crazier than I thought.

1020
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:26,262
- For the past few weeks,

1021
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:30,429
I fucked so many guys, I went
from tampon regular to ultra.

1022
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:37,533
I think I need to go incognito,
like wear some big glasses

1023
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:40,433
and a wig, and maybe grow a beard.

1024
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:43,633
- You are killing me.

1025
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:46,480
- I'm going to open an
online dating account

1026
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,269
and start dating guys from there.

1027
00:59:49,269 --> 00:59:51,047
- Will you wear your dark
glasses when you fuck?

1028
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:53,462
- Hell yeah, it's not like I wanna see

1029
00:59:53,462 --> 00:59:54,703
their stupid faces anyhow.

1030
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:03,959
- So, if I may ask, is
it too bright in here?

1031
01:00:05,129 --> 01:00:07,379
- Actually, yes; I'm sorry.

1032
01:00:08,493 --> 01:00:10,058
I have an eye disease and--

1033
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:12,401
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1034
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,066
It's just, I mean I wish I
could see your eyes, you know.

1035
01:00:15,066 --> 01:00:16,775
- Yeah right, like you
really wanna see that

1036
01:00:16,775 --> 01:00:17,858
and not this.

1037
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:23,231
- Okay, I mean, they're
really nice too but,

1038
01:00:26,384 --> 01:00:27,882
you wanna order something?

1039
01:00:27,882 --> 01:00:32,020
- How could you possibly do
something so off-the-charts?

1040
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,460
I mean with her sister?

1041
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,517
Come on!

1042
01:00:34,517 --> 01:00:35,836
- Thanks, you don't have to
rub it in my face, alright.

1043
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:37,458
- But it's hopefully over now, right?

1044
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:41,625
- Athena doesn't answer
the phone, texts, nothing.

1045
01:00:43,089 --> 01:00:45,450
- Ah man, you are incredible.

1046
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,572
Anyhow, we have to end our experiment.

1047
01:00:47,572 --> 01:00:49,391
This is taking too long.

1048
01:00:49,391 --> 01:00:50,668
- The things we did, man.

1049
01:00:50,668 --> 01:00:52,951
You should have seen that;
she was a fucking machine.

1050
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:54,234
- And the dream is over.

1051
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,394
We have to finish this
now, do you hear me?

1052
01:00:56,394 --> 01:00:58,679
We can't continue this placebo experiment.

1053
01:00:58,679 --> 01:01:00,550
It's unethical and wrong.

1054
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,044
Finished, okay?

1055
01:01:02,044 --> 01:01:04,386
- No man, I mean are you crazy?

1056
01:01:04,386 --> 01:01:06,038
Nobody got hurt, right?

1057
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,028
It was just a sugar pill.

1058
01:01:07,028 --> 01:01:09,263
No man, and going back to
a no sex life, Hell no.

1059
01:01:09,263 --> 01:01:11,962
You should've seen her, man.

1060
01:01:11,962 --> 01:01:13,348
It was a fucking dream, alright?

1061
01:01:13,348 --> 01:01:15,515
The things we did, hahaha.

1062
01:01:18,526 --> 01:01:20,076
No, no no.
- Are you okay?

1063
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:25,354
- Oh my fucking god.

1064
01:01:27,408 --> 01:01:29,408
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1065
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:33,581
I'm such a clumsy daisy.

1066
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:36,605
- Hey!

1067
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:37,594
- It didn't hurt?

1068
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:38,427
- Stop, lady!

1069
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:39,260
- It didn't hurt?

1070
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,358
You motherfucker!

1071
01:01:40,358 --> 01:01:42,230
You piece of shit asshole!

1072
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,838
Didn't hurt?
- Oh my god.

1073
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:45,671
You, You!

1074
01:01:48,273 --> 01:01:49,478
- Get up, bitch!

1075
01:01:49,478 --> 01:01:50,311
It's time to fuck!

1076
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:58,752
Okay Fish, stick it in and
fuck me as hard as you can.

1077
01:01:58,752 --> 01:02:00,389
- Okay, can you help me out here?

1078
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:01,222
- What?

1079
01:02:02,241 --> 01:02:03,074
I didn't know some

1080
01:02:03,074 --> 01:02:07,043
- You either fuck me in a
minute, or I'm out, okay, bitch?

1081
01:02:07,043 --> 01:02:08,626
- Alright, alright.

1082
01:02:11,288 --> 01:02:12,800
Alright, just give me a second, alright?

1083
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:25,977
- Give me a second, a
second; I'm almost done.

1084
01:03:23,973 --> 01:03:24,806
- Athena?

1085
01:03:26,896 --> 01:03:28,313
Athena, you okay?

1086
01:03:29,393 --> 01:03:30,226
Athena?

1087
01:03:35,805 --> 01:03:38,305
Come on, come on, let's go up.

1088
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:45,504
It was all fake.

1089
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,477
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1090
01:04:06,981 --> 01:04:11,148
Athena, I'm not sure this
is a really good idea, okay.

1091
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:23,657
- Right now, this is the
only thing I'm sure about.

1092
01:05:24,237 --> 01:05:26,274
- Jeez, I mean I don't know what to say.

1093
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:29,568
What they did to you is really disgusting.

1094
01:05:29,568 --> 01:05:30,935
Are you gonna sue them?

1095
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:32,178
- No.

1096
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,220
- Why not?

1097
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,524
I mean what they did
is pretty much a crime.

1098
01:05:35,524 --> 01:05:39,213
- Oh, I have some nice ideas for payback.

1099
01:05:39,213 --> 01:05:43,315
Suing would be too easy for those idiots.

1100
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:46,467
- And they surely deserve it.

1101
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:48,645
Will you let me know what
you're gonna do to them?

1102
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:50,140
- It depends.

1103
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,920
- Mmm, on what?

1104
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,916
- On how nice you're going to be with me.

1105
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,166
- Come with me.

1106
01:05:56,437 --> 01:05:57,607
- What do you mean?

1107
01:05:57,607 --> 01:05:58,780
- On the trip, come with me.

1108
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,124
Join me.

1109
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:02,108
- You're crazy; you
know I don't have money.

1110
01:06:02,108 --> 01:06:03,746
- Forget about the money, okay.

1111
01:06:03,746 --> 01:06:04,930
I'll take care of everything.

1112
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:08,264
I'll even hire the best nurses
to take care of your mother.

1113
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,621
- Yes, but what happens when I come back?

1114
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:13,285
I don't have a job and I
probably don't have an apartment,

1115
01:06:13,285 --> 01:06:16,420
and I'll have to start from the beginning.

1116
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:19,208
- Look, I'm 100 % sure I
want you to come with me

1117
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,131
on this trip, okay, and
I can take care of you

1118
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:24,124
for years to come until
you get back on your feet,

1119
01:06:24,124 --> 01:06:25,597
even for the rest of your life.

1120
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:26,430
I mean--

1121
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:31,443
- Let's not argue and
just enjoy the moment.

1122
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,552
- We sent the invitations out too, right?

1123
01:06:44,552 --> 01:06:47,053
- Yep, everything is organized.

1124
01:06:47,053 --> 01:06:48,765
It's all, no worries.

1125
01:06:48,765 --> 01:06:50,495
- I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the opening.

1126
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,662
- Oh, stop it.

1127
01:06:52,544 --> 01:06:54,560
You'll see, everything will be wonderful.

1128
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,310
Besides, it's always
hard for the first time.

1129
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:02,184
Eww.
- What?

1130
01:07:08,155 --> 01:07:09,905
- Hey, Susan.
- Hmmph!

1131
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:15,918
- Hey, Sweetie Puss.

1132
01:07:15,918 --> 01:07:18,251
- What the fuck do you want?

1133
01:07:25,586 --> 01:07:27,765
- Sweetie Puss, listen.

1134
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:31,146
You gotta give me a minute, alright?

1135
01:07:31,146 --> 01:07:34,749
I don't have the words to express the pain

1136
01:07:34,749 --> 01:07:36,582
and the anguish, okay.

1137
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:42,060
You know, with that Helen
stuff and that other thing,

1138
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:46,197
even if my intentions were
right, I fucked up, okay.

1139
01:07:46,197 --> 01:07:47,512
- That other thing?

1140
01:07:47,512 --> 01:07:48,736
You fucking asshole!

1141
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:50,444
Do have any idea what I went through

1142
01:07:50,444 --> 01:07:52,245
when I found out, huh?

1143
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:54,444
You motherfucker!

1144
01:07:54,444 --> 01:07:59,085
- I can't imagine, okay,
and that's why I'm so sorry.

1145
01:07:59,085 --> 01:08:01,192
- What do you think this is?

1146
01:08:01,192 --> 01:08:02,459
A cheesy romantic comedy?

1147
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:04,495
You come here with flowers and chocolates

1148
01:08:04,495 --> 01:08:06,924
and it's all hunky dory,
we're gonna live happily

1149
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:09,462
'til the end of our fucking lives?

1150
01:08:09,462 --> 01:08:12,592
- Listen, you're angry, okay,
and the thing with Helen,

1151
01:08:12,592 --> 01:08:14,592
that was just an escape.

1152
01:08:15,851 --> 01:08:17,109
- An escape?

1153
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:20,493
An escape to her warm, cozy, rotten cunt!

1154
01:08:20,493 --> 01:08:22,259
- It's over, okay.

1155
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:23,517
I finished it; I love you,

1156
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:25,428
and only you, okay.

1157
01:08:25,428 --> 01:08:27,178
You gotta believe me.

1158
01:08:32,627 --> 01:08:35,796
Listen, I understand what I did, okay,

1159
01:08:35,796 --> 01:08:38,457
and that's why I went
into fucking hyper mode

1160
01:08:38,457 --> 01:08:42,091
and really thought about
my actions, alright.

1161
01:08:42,091 --> 01:08:45,800
- I'm still so confused about
this entire fucking thing.

1162
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,217
My life right now

1163
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,932
is fucked up.

1164
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,092
- I know, Sweetie; that's
why you gotta give me

1165
01:08:53,092 --> 01:08:54,604
a second chance,

1166
01:08:54,604 --> 01:08:55,437
alright.

1167
01:08:55,437 --> 01:08:57,854
It will all be different now.

1168
01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:03,512
- If you're expecting an
answer right now, you're wrong.

1169
01:09:03,512 --> 01:09:04,879
- Sweetie Puss, I love you, okay.

1170
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:07,462
I'll wait forever; just please,

1171
01:09:09,684 --> 01:09:11,434
think about it, okay?

1172
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:28,170
- I would love to pull his ball sack

1173
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:31,861
around his silly neck and strangle him,

1174
01:09:31,861 --> 01:09:33,444
but that's just me.

1175
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,620
- That's actually an interesting image.

1176
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,813
- But what about this Victor guy?

1177
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:48,263
He sounds intriguing,
somebody I'd root for.

1178
01:09:48,263 --> 01:09:50,930
- Actually, he's a real darling.

1179
01:09:52,903 --> 01:09:55,660
So do you feel something for him?

1180
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,493
Love?

1181
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:59,309
- That's the thing.

1182
01:10:00,754 --> 01:10:04,587
I'm so confused; my
feelings are all mixed up.

1183
01:10:08,186 --> 01:10:09,019
- Darling,

1184
01:10:11,049 --> 01:10:12,716
you are a wonderful,

1185
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:15,823
beautiful,

1186
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:18,501
very strong woman.

1187
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:25,675
It's time you fought back all those people

1188
01:10:25,675 --> 01:10:29,842
who messed with you and
take control of your life,

1189
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:37,457
and enjoy life with somebody
who really appreciates you

1190
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:39,457
for exactly who you are.

1191
01:10:46,044 --> 01:10:48,329
Call him;
what are you waiting for?

1192
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:49,534
- I don't know.

1193
01:10:49,534 --> 01:10:52,054
Damn, why doesn't he just call me?

1194
01:10:52,054 --> 01:10:54,719
- Well, because Theo's
probably as timid as you are.

1195
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,306
- God, isn't that a match?

1196
01:10:57,306 --> 01:11:00,622
- Well, we invited him
to the opening, right,

1197
01:11:00,622 --> 01:11:03,612
and if he shows up, that
will be the indication

1198
01:11:03,612 --> 01:11:06,506
if he's interested or not.

1199
01:11:06,506 --> 01:11:08,173
Holy fuck!

1200
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:10,405
- Have you seen the devil?

1201
01:11:10,405 --> 01:11:11,238
- Yes.

1202
01:11:14,434 --> 01:11:16,142
- Wait, really?

1203
01:11:16,142 --> 01:11:17,457
- Oh come on, Susan.

1204
01:11:17,457 --> 01:11:20,625
- No, I better not say anything.`

1205
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,869
- Stop being so over-dramatic
and fuck, just say it.

1206
01:11:23,869 --> 01:11:25,952
- Okay, well I saw Jacob.

1207
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:31,242
- Well, I guess that's unavoidable.

1208
01:11:31,242 --> 01:11:33,857
Jersey City's not a big place.

1209
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:35,690
- And he wasn't alone.

1210
01:11:37,045 --> 01:11:38,878
- No, don't say it.

1211
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:39,711
Yes.

1212
01:11:39,711 --> 01:11:40,544
- No.

1213
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:42,451
- Yes, he was with that cunt, Helen.

1214
01:11:42,451 --> 01:11:43,284
- What?

1215
01:11:44,812 --> 01:11:46,915
Motherfucker, really?

1216
01:11:46,915 --> 01:11:50,783
- Embracing and kissing and all that shit.

1217
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,709
- You know what, that's it!

1218
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,331
I'm done, okay.

1219
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:59,396
I'm gonna go pay a visit
to someone special.

1220
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:01,288
- I would not wanna be that somebody.

1221
01:12:01,288 --> 01:12:04,384
- Do you think she's
going to Helen or Jacob?

1222
01:12:04,384 --> 01:12:08,384
- No idea; I wouldn't
want to be either of them.

1223
01:12:09,261 --> 01:12:11,094
- You can't come in; he's got a patient.

1224
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:13,043
- We need to talk now!

1225
01:12:13,043 --> 01:12:15,218
- God damn it Athena, are
you out of your fucking mind?

1226
01:12:15,218 --> 01:12:18,691
Mr Bleaker, didn't I tell
you to take a laxative.

1227
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:19,691
God damn it!

1228
01:12:21,519 --> 01:12:22,979
Are you completely nuts?

1229
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:25,078
What the fuck are you doing?

1230
01:12:25,078 --> 01:12:28,667
- You'd better shut the fuck
up after what you did to me.

1231
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:30,482
You're going to do something for me now.

1232
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:33,400
You're going to do the same
thing to Jacob you did to me.

1233
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,658
- What?

1234
01:12:34,658 --> 01:12:37,360
- You are going to give
Jacob a placebo pill.

1235
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,213
- He won't fall for it, not after,

1236
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:41,517
well, you know why.

1237
01:12:41,517 --> 01:12:43,696
He's not that stupid.

1238
01:12:43,696 --> 01:12:46,572
- Oh, he will; you will convince him.

1239
01:12:46,572 --> 01:12:49,528
You will call him for yearly checkup exam

1240
01:12:49,528 --> 01:12:53,474
and then you're gonna tell
him he has brain tumor.

1241
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:54,822
- You're nuts.

1242
01:12:54,822 --> 01:12:56,436
No fucking way; I'm not gonna do it.

1243
01:12:56,436 --> 01:12:58,873
- Oh, I'm going to go to press.

1244
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:00,870
I'm going to tell your wife.

1245
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:04,941
After I'm done with you,
I will not be surprised

1246
01:13:04,941 --> 01:13:06,630
if they won't let you practice on some

1247
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,222
fucked up Guinea pigs.

1248
01:13:09,222 --> 01:13:11,133
Oh, and this is not all, my dear Max.

1249
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:14,046
After you tell him he ha brain cancer,

1250
01:13:14,046 --> 01:13:17,480
you are going to tell him that you have

1251
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,624
an experimental pill for him.

1252
01:13:19,624 --> 01:13:22,952
- How am I gonna convince
him that he's got cancer?

1253
01:13:22,952 --> 01:13:25,547
- Oh, you fucking convinced me, right?

1254
01:13:25,547 --> 01:13:28,768
He's your friend; he'll trust you.

1255
01:13:28,768 --> 01:13:33,086
Just take some x rays from
a sick person or something,

1256
01:13:33,086 --> 01:13:36,746
and after that, you are going to tell him

1257
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,122
about serious side effects.

1258
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:53,374
I don't know
guys, I feel really stupid.

1259
01:13:53,374 --> 01:13:55,178
All this makeup, this dress, these heels.

1260
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:56,200
It's not me.

1261
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,274
I don't even know if Theo's gonna show up.

1262
01:13:58,274 --> 01:14:00,607
Oh stop it, babe.

1263
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:15,280
- Theo hi, thank you for coming.

1264
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,592
- Namaste, thank you so much
for the invitation really.

1265
01:14:18,592 --> 01:14:21,832
Wow, you are a talented photographer.

1266
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,917
I love what I'm seeing.

1267
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,079
- Oh, you're so cute.

1268
01:14:26,079 --> 01:14:28,350
Thank you, but I don't know if it's true.

1269
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:29,666
- Of course it's true.

1270
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,488
Really, you are truly blessed.

1271
01:14:32,488 --> 01:14:34,369
I love what I'm seeing, and
Athena, I love your collages.

1272
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:35,369
I really do.

1273
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,674
- Thanks Theo, you're too kind.

1274
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,141
Did you come with Victor?

1275
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:43,305
- I haven't seen him
all week, but I am sure

1276
01:14:43,305 --> 01:14:45,240
he's going to show.

1277
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:49,323
- Well, enjoy the show
and other beautiful views.

1278
01:14:50,909 --> 01:14:53,554
- Wow, I am so impressed by your work.

1279
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:56,887
The colors, the composition, incredible.

1280
01:14:58,253 --> 01:15:01,565
- Hey guys, I'm so glad you can make it.

1281
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:05,021
Well, thanks for the invite.

1282
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:08,387
- I'm not sure if you
were serious in your text.

1283
01:15:08,387 --> 01:15:10,957
This is not a joke, right?

1284
01:15:10,957 --> 01:15:12,830
- As I wrote, we're okay.

1285
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,846
Besides, I think you
guys are a better couple

1286
01:15:14,846 --> 01:15:16,346
than we ever were.

1287
01:15:17,818 --> 01:15:19,925
- Okay, I guess so.

1288
01:15:19,925 --> 01:15:22,118
- I have something for you.

1289
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,827
I made this for you.

1290
01:15:23,827 --> 01:15:26,275
What is it?

1291
01:15:26,275 --> 01:15:28,277
- Your favorite cucumber salad.

1292
01:15:28,277 --> 01:15:31,025
Your favorite I made just for you.

1293
01:15:31,025 --> 01:15:32,552
- You're joking.

1294
01:15:32,552 --> 01:15:33,385
What is this?

1295
01:15:33,385 --> 01:15:34,429
The help?

1296
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:35,774
You didn't shit in it, right?

1297
01:15:35,774 --> 01:15:37,191
- Don't be silly.

1298
01:15:38,029 --> 01:15:40,765
Who wouldn't taste shit in the pie?

1299
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:42,507
That seems so ridiculous anyway.

1300
01:15:42,507 --> 01:15:44,174
- Yeah, maybe later.

1301
01:15:45,138 --> 01:15:49,131
- I made it just for
you as a sign of peace.

1302
01:15:49,131 --> 01:15:50,714
- Okay, I guess so.

1303
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:01,039
Wow, its really good.

1304
01:16:01,873 --> 01:16:03,255
Thanks, Athena.

1305
01:16:03,255 --> 01:16:05,088
- You're very welcome.

1306
01:16:07,377 --> 01:16:10,294
Enjoy the show; will you excuse me?

1307
01:16:14,348 --> 01:16:18,164
- Hey Fish, I'm so glad you made it.

1308
01:16:18,164 --> 01:16:20,252
- Babe, I wouldn't miss
this show for anything.

1309
01:16:20,252 --> 01:16:21,558
How you guys doing?

1310
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:22,753
- Very good.

1311
01:16:22,753 --> 01:16:24,461
I didn't sell anything, but Susan did.

1312
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:27,304
- That's awesome, I'm
so glad for you guys,

1313
01:16:27,304 --> 01:16:28,927
and you'll sell a collage soon.

1314
01:16:28,927 --> 01:16:32,434
I can't wait to see your artwork.

1315
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:35,693
Damn, you look so damn breathtaking.

1316
01:16:35,693 --> 01:16:39,002
I just came to tell you something.

1317
01:16:39,002 --> 01:16:40,085
- I love you.

1318
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:43,574
- I know; I feel the same way.

1319
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:46,390
I mean, I love you too.

1320
01:16:49,498 --> 01:16:51,625
- I'm sorry, I interrupted you.

1321
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:54,485
- I just wanted to tell you
that I'll be leaving soon.

1322
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:55,318
- Oh.

1323
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,642
- You know, the trip.

1324
01:16:58,642 --> 01:16:59,852
- When?

1325
01:16:59,852 --> 01:17:03,769
- In about a month, and
I got you a ticket too.

1326
01:17:05,972 --> 01:17:08,357
From New York to Paris.

1327
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,593
See, I thought that since
you've never been to Europe,

1328
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:12,755
we can start our trip in Paris and then,

1329
01:17:12,755 --> 01:17:16,085
we can spend some time in Europe
and visit the major cities

1330
01:17:16,085 --> 01:17:17,718
and then go to Moscow.

1331
01:17:17,718 --> 01:17:21,919
And then from there, we can
take the Trans-Siberian Express.

1332
01:17:21,919 --> 01:17:25,916
I mean, look, to be honest,
I'm just not sure that I

1333
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:27,833
wanna live without you.

1334
01:17:28,972 --> 01:17:31,100
Ever since we had our night together,

1335
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,706
I can't stop thinking about you.

1336
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,328
- Can you wait here for a second?

1337
01:17:40,328 --> 01:17:41,161
- Sure.

1338
01:17:44,936 --> 01:17:47,765
- Actually, there's something
else you can do for me.

1339
01:17:47,765 --> 01:17:49,369
- Okay, what?

1340
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:51,418
- You're gonna watch Mom while I'm gone.

1341
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:53,778
- No Athena, you know I have--

1342
01:17:53,778 --> 01:17:55,195
- You owe me one.

1343
01:17:56,549 --> 01:17:57,632
- Okay, yeah.

1344
01:18:19,085 --> 01:18:20,401
- Are you nervous?

1345
01:18:20,401 --> 01:18:22,360
- No, not really.

1346
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,193
Excited.

1347
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:29,469
You know, it's been a
long time since I left JC.

1348
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:30,951
I think I'm gonna miss it.

1349
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:33,451
- Now I don't know about that.

1350
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:47,540
- Nice day today isn't it, sir.

1351
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,373
Do you think you can spare a--

1352
01:18:48,373 --> 01:18:49,290
- Fuck you!

1353
01:18:56,475 --> 01:18:57,843
- What's so funny?

1354
01:18:57,843 --> 01:18:58,676
- Nothing.

1355
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:04,156
I just had a thought about Jacob.

1356
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,486
- Okay.

1357
01:19:05,486 --> 01:19:07,569
- Oh, it's not like that.

1358
01:19:10,242 --> 01:19:12,659
I organized a little payback.

1359
01:19:14,093 --> 01:19:15,755
- I see.

1360
01:19:15,755 --> 01:19:17,733
You did mention something about revenge.

1361
01:19:17,733 --> 01:19:19,604
You are a little devil
after all, aren't you?

1362
01:19:19,604 --> 01:19:21,188
- No.

1363
01:19:21,188 --> 01:19:22,438
Maybe a little.

1364
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:04,977
- You okay?

1365
01:20:06,233 --> 01:20:07,983
- Yeah fuck me, Stud!
