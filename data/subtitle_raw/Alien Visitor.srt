of cold water and heat it slowly,

178
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:59,352
it'll swim around quite happily
until the water gets too hot...

179
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,757
and kills it.

180
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,160
So?

181
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:13,103
Are you representative of the level of
intelligence here, or are you particularly stupid?

182
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,164
About average, Id say.

183
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:19,404
This place is worse
than I thought.

184
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,846
What happens to the second frog
is what's happening to you here...

185
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,514
right this minute.

186
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,526
And I want to get off
before the water boils.

187
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,596
Your eggs are burning.

188
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,228
He had the beginnings
of a real problem on his hands.

189
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,238
Eggs!

190
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:52,707
He wanted nothing more
than to be rid of her,

191
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,146
but she showed
no signs of going.

192
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:02,181
Did you some more eggs.
They're perfect.

193
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:13,431
And he couldn't
find it within himself to cast her out.

194
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:20,063
He began to consider what
his course of action should be.

195
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:25,466
He needn't have.

196
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:30,243
Events soon spiraled
out of his control.

197
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,478
What's this?

198
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,578
Bacon.

199
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,784
- You mean dead pig.
- It's bacon.

200
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,259
Why don't you call it "dead pig"
if you know that's what it is?

201
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,261
Why don't you let me enjoy
my breakfast?

202
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,726
How can you do it?

203
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,795
Do what?

204
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,662
Eat dead pig.

205
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,757
It's wasteful of resources.

206
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,600
It's cruel in the extreme,
and is symptomatic...

207
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:30,074
- of an immature and egocentric society.
- It's a lot of big words.

208
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,839
Oh.

209
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,583
In small words,
it means you're a barbarian.

210
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,917
I'm going. I'll take you to
the nearest town, about two hours away.

211
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,056
Or into the city if you're going
that far. That's the best I can do.

212
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,796
Not bad for a frog. Don't know
what we'll do about the clothes.

213
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,100
We're not going into the city. There are
too many people. They'll never find me.

214
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:05,440
Fine by me. I'm going to the city,
you can do what you like.

215
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,502
Are you going in this?

216
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,516
No, there's a helicopter
arriving in five minutes.

217
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,955
These things are
the most primitive,

218
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,980
dirty and greedy things
ever invented.

219
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:24,723
I'm not going to be an accessory
to the murder of this planet...

220
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,890
Oy! Oy!

221
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,663
Get out of it!
You're mad, you know that?

222
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,832
Completely mad!
We're miles from anywhere. Miles!

223
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,535
Come crashing into my campsite,
disturb my peace.

224
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:43,048
I lend you my clothes, you won't
eat my eggs and now you wreck my truck!

225
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,248
Sorry.

226
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,791
Sorry.

227
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,823
Sorry for losing my temper like that.

228
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,667
I didn't mean to say you're mad.

229
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:11,767
It's just, I only finished
paying it off last month.

230
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,643
That's all right. It's good
to give in to your feelings.

231
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:21,076
-You really like this thing, don't you?
Yes.

232
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:25,351
I've put a lot of work into it.
Well, the mechanics.

233
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,358
The body's next.

234
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,395
And you really like it here,
don't you?

235
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,369
Yeah, it's one
of my favorite places.

236
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,033
Look, I'm sorry
for pushing you like that.

237
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,839
I want to show you something.

238
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,312
Look over there.

239
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,474
See the contradiction?

240
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,047
That was a pretty good trick.

241
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,054
- How'd you do it?
- I'm from Epsilon.

242
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:36,124
Mmm. Sorry
I ever doubted it.

243
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:41,758
Are we actually here,
or do I just think we're here?

244
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,131
We're actually here.

245
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,172
<i>He was finally
compelled to admit to himself...</i>

246
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,936
that she might, after all,

247
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,876
be who she'd said she was.

248
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,879
Useful way to travel.

249
00:21:55,947 --> 00:22:00,009
It was not the only surprise
she had for him.

250
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,495
I'm finding this
a bit hard to grasp.

251
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,670
- Lovely paradox, isn't it?
- What?

252
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,839
The more I slow you down,
the faster things seem to go.

253
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:33,010
You live your lives
very quickly.

254
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:49,098
Afterwards he was to say
that in these early moments with her...

255
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,829
he'd felt curiously composed,

256
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,338
as if discovering
this other world...

257
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:59,469
was no different from visiting
a new place or another country.

258
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:07,045
I think the reality was somehow
a little different.

259
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,645
From his memory of it.

260
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,655
I'm getting dizzy!

261
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:16,354
These concepts are obviously too much
for your incredibly limited intellect.

262
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:20,729
I'm not talking about that. I'm getting
dizzy with what's happening to me.

263
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,633
- You don't get the point, do you?
- I get the point, all right.

264
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:29,140
- It's just my brain's a bit slow catching up.
- How very perceptive of you.

265
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,232
We're in one place one second,

266
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,574
then we're somewhere completely
different in the same second.

267
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,514
Then everything speeds up, and it
gets dark and we're somewhere else,

268
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,746
and I barely know
who I am anymore!

269
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,380
No need to shout.

270
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,995
- Where are we?
- Still here.

271
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:56,728
- Still where?
- Still on Earth.

272
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,668
The stars!
The stars are moving.

273
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,142
The stars are not moving.

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,510
<i>That's your Earth turning.</i>

275
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,514
Oh.

276
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,122
I knew that.

277
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,717
Look.

278

[ Birds Chirping ♪

279
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:41,679
She'd returned him
to where he'd started.

280
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:48,710
But he didn't know
when anymore, or how.

281
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,724
<i>Or even if
he was really there...</i>

282
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,163
or somewhere strange
in his mind.

00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,098
Where's my truck gone?

284
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,102
You just haven't arrived yet.

285
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,476
How am I ever going to arrive
if my truck's broken?

286
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:18,881
I thought it would be obvious
to you that I haven't broken it yet.

287
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,350
Not that obvious.

288
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,120
We'd better get back
into the present.

289
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,424
If I'm here before I got here,
they won't be looking for me yet.

290
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,956
And when later on they do look,
I won't be here for them to find me.

291
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,002
Yeah.

292
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,037
Yeah?

293
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:50,374
And then he began to think
about what was really happening to him.

294
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,439
This is incredible!

295
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:59,115
And what it could mean to Aim
if he wasn't imagining it.

296
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,955
He had an idea, you see.

297
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:10,265
Is it possible
for me to do this?

298
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,134
- Do what?
- You know.

299
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:17,766
Just sort of zap around from place
to place wherever I think of.

300
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:21,870
I doubt if you have the mental capacity
to learn to do it by yourself.

301
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,349
I thought it would be obvious to you that
I didn't mean I'd be doing it by myself,

302
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,943
but is it possible?

303
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,320
- Why would you want to?
- I've had this idea.

304
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,825
I guess, as long
as you're with me.

305
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,557
Okay.
Okay, I'll try it.

306
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,589
Bear with me.
It'll be worth it.

307
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,228
- Don't look.
- No.

308
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,573
Where are we?
We should be somewhere else.

309
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,584
You mean there?

310
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,986
Huh! Got us close,
didn't I?

311
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,958
Not bad for a first time.
Now I'll see if I can get us closer.

312
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,929
- Nothing happened.
- That's 'cause I don't want to go there.

313
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,271
Are you kidding?
That's Las Vegas!

314
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,210
I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas.
I've got a system.

315
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,270
- Have you?
- Mm-hmm.

316
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,318
Well, off you go then.

317
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,255
Bye.

318

00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,037
Normal time, I mean.

321

Use your brains.

322
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,075
Right.

323
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,840
Good luck!

324
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,213
He admitted later
that his first thoughts had been...

325
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,721
how he, himself,
could benefit from this...

326
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:13,190
unusual liaison.

327
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:26,227
<i>A night in the most acquisitive place
on Earth, however,</i>

328
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:31,401
was to be enough
to cure him of such notions.

329
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:41,578
For a moment he considered
finding his own way home.

330
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:48,587
But the lure of possibility
was too strong,

331
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,630
and he found himself
returning to her.

332
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,331
- Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
- It was nothing, really.

333
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,002
Whoo-hoo!
Did I have a time of it!

334
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:11,140
- I was on a roll. It was great.
- Did your system work?

335
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:15,676
Well, it works.
Just didn't work this time.

336
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,688
Fun, eh?

337
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,656
Life is one long search for fun.

338
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,286
Some people never find it.

339
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,888
Don't knock it
when somebody does.

340
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:31,027
- Oh. So you do actually think!
- Yeah.

341
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,036
About life, I mean.

342
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,096
I just don't dwell on it,
that's all.

343
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:40,304
I got your point.
The trucks, the traffic jam.

344
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,473
It's just...
there's no easy answers.

345
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,745
He was right.

346
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,949
There are no easy answers.

347
00:29:55,693 --> 00:30:00,187
But she was determined to force him
to think about the questions.

348
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,324
What do you see down there?

349
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,836
A city covered with smog.

350
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:10,466
Ten million frogs
slowly boiling to death.

351
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:14,206
It is, for me,

352
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,342
unimaginable that you people
choose to live like this.

353
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:24,617
There are ten million people
down there.

354
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:29,525
They cough, they complain,
their children get sick.

355
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,596
Here on Earth
you have an expression.

356
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:40,161
"Sticking your head in the sand."
The ostrich mentality,

357
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,800
because that's what ostriches do
to make problems go away.

358
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:50,679
In the rest of the universe, we have an
expression that means almost the same thing.

359
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:55,310
It is,
"To breathe the foul air."

360
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:59,880
If we say someone
is breathing the foul air,

361
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,019
we mean they have
the Earth mentality.

362
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:08,533
It is about the worst insult
you can level at someone...

363
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,059
<i>because having the Earth mentality
is the one thing...</i>

364
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:17,597
that is truly unforgivable
in the rest of the universe.

365
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,618
Can we go
somewhere else, please?

366
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:31,588
Somewhere where
I can see some stars.

367
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,176
He knew by this time...

368
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:58,182
that nothing in his life
would ever be the same again.

369
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,100
I feel better now.

370
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:22,068
What did you mean,
the rest of the universe?

371
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,442
- You know what is meant by "intelligent life-forms"?
- Of course I do.

372
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,812
- Well, you're not one of them.
- I'm not?

373
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,214
Not just you.

374
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:37,517
The human race is not considered in universal
terms to be an intelligent life-form.

375
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,649
- I suppose you lot are?
- Yes, of course.

376
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,128
One of many.

377
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,546
She began to talk with him.

378
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,253
Talk of how the intelligent life-forms
of the universe...

379
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,764
<i>had concluded that Earth
was beyond help.</i>

380
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:29,000
Earth had proved itself to be
the most irrational of all known places,

381
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:34,773
the least willing to listen
to the most obvious.

382
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,508
He denied it, of course.

383
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:42,782
<i>But when she told him that Earth
had now been left to destroy itself...</i>

384
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,551
by its own devices,

385
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,285
he fell silent.

386
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:55,222
"Why, then, had she come here?"
he eventually asked,

387
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:59,463
And she didn't know.
She couldn't answer him.

388
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,405
She thought
it must've been a mistake,

389
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,672
and she hoped she would
soon be discovered and taken off.

390
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,682
Knowing at least some of what she said
to have been true,

391
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,311
it had made him laugh.

392
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:21,348
Laugh out loud
at the bizarre turn int £175 fife.

393
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:25,192
I'm glad you're able
to take it in such good humor.

394
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:30,758
You earthlings have always been
exceptionally good at denying reality.

395
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,270
I think we ought to have
a relationship.

396
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,806
Would you mind?

397
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,070
Hell.
I beg your pardon?

398
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,737
I feel the need
to have a relationship.

399
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:45,443
We're together anyway, so it makes
perfect sense to be having a relationship.

400
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,816
- We hardly know each other.
- It's quite easy, really.

401
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:52,516
We'll treat each other with respect
and kindness, and have a relationship.

402
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,922
- Just like that, eh?
- Is that so hard?

403
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,895
No, no.
Suits me fine.

404
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,364
Some simple rules
need to be followed.

405
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,835
Say what you mean,
mean what you say.

406
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:10,465
Don't get offended by anything I say or do,
no matter how hard that might be for you...

407
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,478
until after we've agreed
to terminate the relationship.

408
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,242
Don't bottle up your feelings,

409
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,647
agree to disagree,

410
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:23,312
respect the other's
point of view.

411
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,880
That's the one that's going to be
hardest for me. Okay?

412
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,723
- Sounds easy enough.
- Good.

413
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,661
That's decided then.

414
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,300
Hmm.

415
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,637
If we're having a relationship,

416
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,666
I think you should
tuck your shirt in.

417
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,271
If that's what you'd like...
darling.

418
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:53,215
This is all going
a bit fast for me.

419
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:57,482
Would you mind not using that word until
our relationship's a bit better established?

420
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,217
- Sure.
- Thanks.

421
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:04,728
- Let's go.
- That's how it started.

422
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:08,129
But progress did not prove
to be in fine with his expectations.

423
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,323
Where are we now?

424
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,802
Still the same place.

425
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:18,502
We're obviously
in a different place.

426
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,546
I can't see the difference.

427
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:28,176
You Epsilonians certainly have
a different way of looking at things.

428
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,187
It's not us, it's you that are
out of step.

429
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,589
With the rest of the universe?

430
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:39,927
- Won't that affect the course of our relationship?
- No, it doesn't have to.

431
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:42,796
- Could you lend me your belt?
- What's my belt got to do with it?

432
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,064
You obviously
find me attractive.

433
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,300
So in order to help this early part
of our relationship,

434
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:55,107
Id like to put your belt around
my waist to accentuate my female shape.

435
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,809
When you look at me,
which you do quite often,

436
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,443
the signal to your brain
will be stronger,

437
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,920
meaning your hormone release
will be greater.

438
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:09,324
Hence, the relationship will improve...
from your point of view, anyway.

439
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:13,193
I'm not sure
what's in it for me.

440
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,198
Belt?

441
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,235
What about feelings?

442
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:23,137
I'm talking about much more powerful
things than feelings.

443
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,301
I'm talking about hormones.

444
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,311
I never think much
about them myself.

445
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,487
Would you mind not doing that
without giving me some warning?

446
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,820
It's very disorienting.

447
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,258
You'll get used to it.

448
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,675
I must say, it's about the last thing
I ever imagined.

449
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,611
Having a relationship
with a being from Earth.

450
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,610
Must be tough for your hormones,

451
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:10,211
having to cope with
a pig-eating barbarian.

452
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,758
- You're quaint.
- Just what I wanted to hear!

453
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:25,132
I finally started a relationship,
and she thinks I'm quaint.

454
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,637
How much warning do you want?

455
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,072
Okay.

456
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,411
- Where are we now?
- Same place.

457
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,615
No, we're not.
We're somewhere different.

458
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,921
We're in the same place,
still on Earth.

459
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,021
Yes, but where on Earth?

460
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:57,466
Do you think these trees
are trying to die by themselves?

461
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:01,529
That they've just decided
to up and perish for no good reason?

462
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,475
Well, do you?

463
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,444
Or don't you think about it?

464
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,709
Maybe they've got
a fungus or something.

465
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,275
Maybe you've got
a fungus in your brain.

466
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,220
He knew it wasn't a fungus.

467
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:22,123
He knew why
those trees were dying.

468
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,924
Like so many people
in those days,

469
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:29,865
he didn't want to admit
that he knew.

470
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:33,427
He would have condemned himself.
His whole way of life,

471
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,872
his friends, his neighbors.

472
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:42,846
Deep down he knew he'd killed those trees
as much as anyone had killed those trees...

473
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,507
though he'd never
seen them before,

474
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,281
never touched them.

475
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:53,551
But even then, to her,
he couldn't admit it.

476
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:57,254
So don't keep asking me,
"Where on Earth?"

477
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,162
- It's all the same place.
- Right.

478
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,782
What are you doing?

479
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,923
What are you doing?

480
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,194
What are you doing?

481
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,295
- Looking for frogs.
- Oh.

482
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,415
See any?

483
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,746
Not yet.

484
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,155
Why are you looking for frogs?

485
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:08,324
- Frogs are a measure of the health of a place.
- Oh.

486
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,835
I thought maybe you were gonna
boil one up for me.

487
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:16,897
- Why would I want to do that?
- I might learn something.

488
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,510
Hey!

489
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,613
No frogs around here.

490
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,022
That she might have
a sense of humor...

491
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,959
was something he'd overlooked.

492
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:43,194
She began to...
to affect Aim.

493
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,532
He began, in his own way,

494
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,164
to open up to her.

495
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,768
My watch is behaving pretty strangely
with all this jumping around.

496
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,006
And I don't want a lecture
about time.

497
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,845
I'm just telling you,
that's all.

498
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,283
Strange for me, that is.

499
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,151
That's nice for you.

500
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,717
I'm growing quite fond
of you, you know.

501
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:13,525
That must be even nicer for you.

502
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:17,033
- There's something I've been meaning to ask.
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:22,733
Are there any, like, boundaries
on our relationship?

504
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:28,711
- How do you mean boundaries?
- Well, boundaries, you know?

505
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:34,309
Like... for example,
physical boundaries.

506
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:39,846
I don't know if I've known you five minutes
or a week, my watch behaving strangely.

507
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,224
But I figured it wouldn't hurt
to ask, you know?

508
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:46,320
Say what you mean and all that.

509
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,729
What do you mean?

510
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:53,566
Well... you know.

511
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:59,508
If that's your idea of saying what you mean,
no wonder this place is in such a mess.

512
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:07,379
- Do you know where we are now?
- No, but yes.

513
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,579
Yes, I do.

514
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,619
- Where are they?
- Who?

515
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:18,788
- The people who lived here.
- Nobody ever lived here.

516
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:22,765
- They did, you know.
- Well, they don't now.

517
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:30,397
They stood together on
the threshold of the world in another time,

518
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:35,742
a lonely surveyor
and a woman from another planet.

519
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,160
In that moment, he said,

520
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:57,360
<i>he felt as close
to another human as he ever had.</i>

521
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,404
Only she wasn't really a human.

522
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,704
She was from Epsilon,

523
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:10,714
and thought that humans were foolish,
ridiculous, absurd.

524
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,682
He didn't let his being a human
stop him.

525
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:20,486
He was becoming enchanted
by her.

526
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,188
Can have my belt back?

527
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,992
No.

528
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:30,090
- Why do you want your belt back?
- It's my hormones.

529
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,364
Your womanly shape
Is driving them crazy.

530
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:37,305
And you didn't answer my question
about physical boundaries.

531
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,275
- You're quaint.
- Don't say that!

532
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,836
Why not? There's nothing
wrong with being quaint.

533
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,405
There is when
I'm not trying to be.

534
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:50,477
We're in a relationship. You don't
have to try to be anything.

535
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:54,149
I don't like to be considered quaint
when I'm in a relationship.

536
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,716
But you are.

537
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:02,663
- That always happens to me.
- What?

538
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:06,727
Women tend to think I'm
their best friend instead of...

539
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,772
You know.

540
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:13,743
No, I don't know.
Tell me.

541
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,046
I had a girlfriend once.

542
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,607
We eventually broke up.

543
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:25,281
A week later she came back
to visit me, see if I was okay.

544
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:30,020
She sat down at the kitchen table
and said she had a new boyfriend.

545
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:34,588
"How long has that been going on?"
I said. She said, "A week."

546
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:40,399
"That was quick, wasn't it? We only
split up a week ago. What's he like?"

547
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:45,136
She said he wasn't as nice as me,
which made me feel better.

548
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:49,237
But that he was a better boyfriend,
which made me feel worse.

549
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,984
"What do you mean
by that?" I said.

550
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:57,783
So she said she fancied him.

551
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:02,190
I just sort of looked at her.
I was feeling pretty hurt.

552
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,196
She misunderstood me and thought I
didn't know what she was talking about.

553
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:11,758
So she said, "You know, you're too nice
to excite me in bed."

554
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:17,001
So I said, pretty angry,
"What do you want? An animal?"

555
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,941
And she said, "Yes."

556
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:37,452
Interesting relationships
you have here.

557
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:41,465
- Are they all like that?
- Usually they're much more complicated.

558
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,627
More complicated?

559
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:48,569
Oh.

560
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,234
I hope you don't expect ours
to be in any way like that.

561
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,210
I don't.

562
00:46:55,279 --> 00:47:00,149
- By staying within the simple rules, we'll avoid such problems.
- We will,

563
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:05,117
So don't get offended
when I call you quaint.

564
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,792
Shouldn't these rules have
some sort of hierarchy?

565
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:19,325
What do you mean?
Simple rules are simple rules.

566
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,862
Yes, but if I say I'm offended,
I'm breaking the rules...

567
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,773
because according to the rules
I'm not allowed to get offended.

568
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,471
But if I don't say I'm offended,
I'm also breaking the rules...

569
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:33,312
because according to the rules
I'm meant to say what I mean.

570
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:37,581
Your reasoning powers
are particularly underdeveloped.

571
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,022
Oh, so it's my fault
the rules are inconsistent.

572
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,788
It's not the rules!
It's the way you think about them.

573
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,455
The way I think
about them drives me mad!

574
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,491
Okay. The relationship will
work if we follow the rules, right?

575
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,697
Um... all right.

576
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:59,231
And you're in a position where because of what
think, you're being forced to break the rules.

577
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,609
- Exactly!
- So change the way you think!

578
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:06,547
- Hey?
- Change the way you think about being called quaint.

579
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:10,178
Revel in the idea.
Glory in it.

580
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:12,780
Then you won't be offended.

581
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,655
Then you won't break the rules.

582
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:26,159
So, you think
I'm quaint, do you?

583
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,866
Yes! You are.

584
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,137
Well, fancy that. I'm quaint!

585
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,406
You are.

586
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,812
Is that all?

587
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,081
What do you mean?

588
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:50,193
You don't think I'm...
very quaint?

589
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:58,460
You know, really, really quaint?

590
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,769
Then you could kiss me again.

591
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,847
What are we doing here
all of a sudden?

592
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,850
Same as the last place,
same as the place before.

593
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,943
What's that?

594
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,684
- Trying to find a place to get off.
- Oh.

595
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,529
It seems to me...

596
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:32,467
that this was really
where the difficulty started,

597
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,062
He hadn't thought it through:

598
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,766
That he was home,

599
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:41,300
but that she wanted to go home.

600
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:44,006
That he was where
he wanted to be,

601
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,244
but that she was somewhere
she didn't like,

602
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,480
somewhere that had
no future for her.

603
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,826
- I thought we just started a relationship.
- 50?

604
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,827
Well, I just thought...

605
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:02,695
- Wouldn't you want to get off if you had the choice?
- No.

606
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:06,259
- That's completely irrational.
- No, it's not.

607
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,670
Why not?

608
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,004
I like it here.

609
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,874
You like it here.

610
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,944
You like it here.

611
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,075
Well, not "here" here.

612
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:25,145
But, yes, I like it here.

613
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:28,590
And how much longer
is "here" going to be here?

614
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,821
I don't know.
But while it's here, I like it here.

615
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:34,330
Besides, where else would go?

616
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:46,153
Say you could go to Epsilon.

617
00:50:46,224 --> 00:50:50,320
I don't know anything about Epsilon.
I mightn't like it there.

618
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:53,387
Do they drink beer there?

619
00:50:53,464 --> 00:50:57,731
- Do they have sex?
- What a stupid question. Of course we do.

620
00:50:57,802 --> 00:51:01,170
Oh! I was beginning
to think maybe you didn't.

621
00:51:01,239 --> 00:51:05,733
- And what made you think that?
- Well, you don't show much evidence of it.

622
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,074
Neither do you!

623
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:12,447
That's easy fixed.
How 'bout it?

624
00:51:12,517 --> 00:51:15,077
- How "bout what?"
- It. You know, what I said before.

625
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:17,087
- You mean sex?
- Yes.

626
00:51:17,155 --> 00:51:19,522
- Between us? How 'bout it?
- Yes.

627
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:21,559
- Let's do it.
- Let's do what?

628
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:24,652
You know, sex.

629
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:29,360
How would we go about
doing... it?

630
00:51:29,434 --> 00:51:31,698
You mean, how would we start?

631
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:34,602
Okay, how would we start?

632
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:38,165
Well, I'd come closer.

633
00:51:38,242 --> 00:51:40,939
- Then what?
- I'd come closer still.

634
00:51:41,012 --> 00:51:43,572
- Yeah? Then what?
- I'd kiss you.

635
00:51:43,648 --> 00:51:45,793
- We've done that.
- You've kissed me. I haven't kissed you.

636
00:51:45,817 --> 00:51:49,981
- How long would you kiss me for?
- I don't know. There's no time limit.

637
00:51:50,054 --> 00:51:53,388
- Then what?
- Then...

638
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:58,487
- Well, it would just sort of progress from there.
- Progress where?

639
00:51:58,563 --> 00:52:00,531
You're asking
difficult questions.

640
00:52:00,598 --> 00:52:03,067
You're being very coy
about answering them.

641
00:52:03,134 --> 00:52:06,832
All right then.
I think I'd start taking off your shirt.

642
00:52:06,904 --> 00:52:11,034
I'm not sure, but I think
that's what I'd do.

643
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:14,409
When I first met you, all you
wanted to do was put a shirt on me.

644
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:17,540
I told you then
it didn't make any sense.

645
00:52:17,615 --> 00:52:21,210
- What would I be doing while you're taking my shirt off?
- You'd be taking mine off me.

646
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:25,244
Wouldn't that be awkward, taking each
other's shirts off at the same time?

647
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:28,691
It might be awkward, but that's what
people do when they're about to do it.

648
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,593
- Why don't we undress ourselves?
- We could.

649
00:52:31,663 --> 00:52:33,757
But it wouldn't be the same.

650
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:37,665
That would mean
it's just sex, nothing else.

651
00:52:37,735 --> 00:52:42,138
Isn't that what
we're talking about? Sex?

652
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:46,074
It might be what
you're talking about.

653
00:52:46,144 --> 00:52:48,841
It's not what I'm talking about.

654
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:55,646
Then I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

655
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,714
Come on.
We'll go somewhere else.

656
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:07,357
We can't.

657
00:53:07,432 --> 00:53:10,299
- Can't what?
- Go somewhere else.

658
00:53:10,368 --> 00:53:14,635
<i>We're doomed to always be
in the same place: On Earth.</i>

659
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:19,966
You might be, but I'm not.

660
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:27,041
You might as well face it. You're probably
gonna be here for a very long time.

661
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,054
No, I'm not.

662
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:33,784
Certainly not.
No way!

663
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:53,735
It's not so bad here, you know.

664
00:53:56,114 --> 00:53:58,708
I've got a comfortable
little house in the city.

665
00:53:58,783 --> 00:54:02,481
I know the airs not perfect,
but I do okay.

666
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:06,251
Go bush quite a bit.
Catch up with friends.

667
00:54:06,324 --> 00:54:10,921
Go to the footy when I can.
It's a good life.

668
00:54:16,234 --> 00:54:19,636
I've got a spare room
if you'd like.

669
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:29,005
- A comfortable little house, eh?
- Yeah.

670
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,448
I'm pretty proud of it.

671
00:54:37,822 --> 00:54:40,052
Do you want to see it?

672
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,662
Not yet.

673
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:53,427
I would like to go
somewhere else nice though.

674
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:58,805
- Like a tree. Do you have a favorite tree?
- Yes.

675
00:54:58,876 --> 00:55:01,538
Can you show it tome?

676
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:04,274
Sure.

677
00:55:20,898 --> 00:55:25,267
Once again, he had
completely misunderstood fer.

678
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:36,204
Only this time,
the events that unfolded...

679
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,217
were to reverberate
through his life forever.

680
00:55:57,401 --> 00:56:01,167
{used to live
not far from here as a child.

681
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:04,300
<i>I'd come to this tree,
and I'd talk to it.</i>

682
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:13,944
"Hello, tree," Id say.

683
00:56:15,286 --> 00:56:17,948
Id tell it what was great
about life that day,

684
00:56:18,022 --> 00:56:20,821
or what was worrying me.

685
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:33,536
You'll think this is a bit silly, but
to me it was the brother I never had.

686
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:40,338
Look at that mark there. That's where
the tree and I exchanged blood.

687
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:46,082
Kid stuff.

688
00:56:48,019 --> 00:56:50,613
But even now, I still sometimes
come here.

689
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:53,952
Do you have an ax?

690
00:56:56,427 --> 00:56:58,953
- Not here. It's in my truck.
- That's okay.

691
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,862
I'll just get it.

692
00:57:06,871 --> 00:57:10,205
- You've got my ax!
- Yes. I said I'd get it.

693
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:13,266
Why do you want my ax?

694
00:57:13,344 --> 00:57:18,942
- To chop your tree down.
- You wouldn't!

695
00:57:19,016 --> 00:57:23,112
Would you?
Not this tree!

696
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:26,714
Please!
Any other tree.

697
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:29,556
Pick another one.
There's forests of them. Please!

698
00:57:29,627 --> 00:57:32,289
He was
without means to stop her.

699
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:39,428
She had the powers,
the strength, the ax.

700
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:44,901
He had only his grief
and his misunderstandings.

701
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:53,183
Every blow felt like a blow
to his heart.

702
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:59,019
But more importantly, every blow
was a blow to his apathy,

703
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:03,857
his indifference
to his place in the world.

704
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,562
But he hadn't known.

705
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:14,161
He didn't know.

706
00:58:16,507 --> 00:58:19,966
He'd never met anyone like her.

707
00:58:20,044 --> 00:58:23,173
Anyone so...
so certain.

708
00:58:25,249 --> 00:58:30,119
Anyone so unwavering.

709
00:58:41,098 --> 00:58:45,228
He watched her
cut his tree down.

710
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:49,500
He saw her anguish.

711
00:58:49,573 --> 00:58:53,942
And he began to grasp
something about her...

712
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:57,905
Her loneliness.

713
00:59:00,217 --> 00:59:03,448
Her isolation
from those less driven,

714
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:08,484
those like him.

715
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:25,874
But he refused to understand,

716
00:59:25,943 --> 00:59:29,675
There. I've ruined
a bit of your planet now.

717
00:59:32,149 --> 00:59:34,811
Satisfied?

718
00:59:34,885 --> 00:59:37,547
[ Panting.

719
00:59:52,403 --> 00:59:54,337
Why?

720
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,774
Why?

721
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:03,047
Because you want me
to stay here!

722
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:11,385
Just my staying here is going to
do that over and over again.

723
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:16,783
I'll start living like you live.
Bang! Another tree down.

724
01:00:16,861 --> 01:00:21,958
I'll start wanting the same things
you want. Bang! Another tree down.

725
01:00:23,734 --> 01:00:27,102
You don't need me here.

726
01:00:43,587 --> 01:00:47,922
He turned her words
over in his mind,

727
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:52,793
trying to make them fit
into his limited view of the world.

728
01:00:57,168 --> 01:01:00,103
But he felt too removed
from her.

729
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:03,334
And he longed to get back
to the simple,

730
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:06,809
the easy, the familiar.

731
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:31,600
You're too extreme for me.

732
01:01:33,237 --> 01:01:35,638
Extreme?

733
01:01:37,074 --> 01:01:40,044
I'm not extreme.

734
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,579
I'm perfectly normal
and sensible.

735
01:01:42,646 --> 01:01:46,776
I mean your actions.
The things you do.

736
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:51,382
You're the one
with the extreme behavior.

737
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:54,481
Your whole way of life
is one of extremes.

738
01:01:54,558 --> 01:01:56,890
You're wrong.

739
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,090
I have a perfectly normal
way of life.

740
01:02:00,164 --> 01:02:05,159
It might be normal, but it doesn't
stop it from being extremely stupid.

741
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:13,001
Id like to terminate
our relationship.

742
01:02:14,478 --> 01:02:17,379
Would that be agreeable to you?

743
01:02:19,383 --> 01:02:22,876
- Pity.
- Why?

744
01:02:25,422 --> 01:02:28,187
I was growing quite fond of you.

745
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:32,521
That must've been nice for you.

746
01:02:33,797 --> 01:02:37,461
So, is the relationship
terminated?

747
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:39,434
I guess it is.

748
01:02:39,503 --> 01:02:41,870
Good.

749
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:45,136
I don't respect
your point of view.

750
01:02:45,209 --> 01:02:48,304
I can't agree to disagree.

751
01:02:48,379 --> 01:02:50,973
I get offended by the things
you say and do.

752
01:02:51,048 --> 01:02:55,315
And I don't think you say what you mean
or mean what you say any more than I do.

753
01:02:55,386 --> 01:02:58,879
And I like bottling up
some of my feelings.

754
01:02:58,956 --> 01:03:01,220
It causes a lot less trouble.

755
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:03,954
That stuff might work
for you on Epsilon,

756
01:03:04,028 --> 01:03:06,793
but it doesn't work for me here.

757
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:13,468
Fine.

758
01:03:15,973 --> 01:03:18,271
Well,

759
01:03:19,843 --> 01:03:23,643
<i>- what now?
- I'd better go.</i>

760
01:03:26,116 --> 01:03:28,050
Keep trying.

761
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,287
- Will you be okay?
- I think so.

762
01:03:33,924 --> 01:03:37,519
It'll take me a while to figure out
how to fix that thing.

763
01:03:37,594 --> 01:03:41,030
Then I'll be on my way too.

764
01:03:44,535 --> 01:03:46,526
Okay, then.

765
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:48,765
Good-bye.

766
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:52,207
Good-bye.

767
01:03:56,714 --> 01:03:59,342
Your clothes,
I'm still wearing them.

768
01:03:59,416 --> 01:04:01,510
That's okay.
You can keep em.

769
01:04:01,585 --> 01:04:04,987
- Oh.
- You never know.

770
01:04:05,055 --> 01:04:08,423
You might meet someone else.
You'd need them then.

771
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:13,191
Yes. You might be right.
Thank you.

772
01:04:13,263 --> 01:04:15,698
That's fine.

773
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:22,170
It was a pleasure
to have met you.

774
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:28,239
Good-bye then.

775
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:30,371
Good-bye.

776
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:55,462
"Twas funny in a way."

777
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:59,203
Neither of them really wanted
to say good-bye,

778
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:03,839
but both of them said it.

779
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:08,579
And only then were they able
to give full consideration...

780
01:05:08,652 --> 01:05:10,916
to what had happened
between them.

781
01:05:27,638 --> 01:05:31,734
Aha! Incredibly
limited intellect, hey?

782
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,963
I breathe the foul air.

783
01:06:06,643 --> 01:06:09,237
What else can I do?

784
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:13,543
That's what makes me what [ am.

785
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:02,555
Hi! I'm... back.

786
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:14,906
For her,
nothing was ever too late.

787
01:07:18,015 --> 01:07:20,313
There's nothing
wrong with being quaint.

788
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:23,363
- There is when I'm not trying to be.
- We're in a relationship.

789
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:26,550
- She went back...
- We don't have to try to be anything.

790
01:07:26,623 --> 01:07:28,921
In time.

791
01:07:28,992 --> 01:07:32,326
I don't like to be considered quaint
when I'm in a relationship.

792
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:35,093
But you are.

793
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:40,499
- That always happens to me.
- What?

794
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:45,236
Women tend to think I'm their
best friend, instead of, you know.

795
01:07:45,309 --> 01:07:49,303
I know what you're saying.
But tell me.

796
01:07:51,882 --> 01:07:55,011
- I had a girlfriend once.
- I know.

797
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:57,486
Do you?
How?

798
01:07:57,554 --> 01:08:00,023
You...
talked about it before.

799
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:03,321
Oh.
I don't remember.

800
01:08:03,393 --> 01:08:05,885
Anyway, we eventually broke up.

801
01:08:05,963 --> 01:08:10,901
A week later she came back
to visit me, see if I was okay.

802
01:08:10,968 --> 01:08:15,201
I sort of feel like I've
told you this story before.

803
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:18,503
- Stop me if I have.
- No, goon.

804
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:20,600
Okay.

805
01:08:21,678 --> 01:08:23,669
Where was I?

806
01:08:23,747 --> 01:08:28,776
You were saying she sat at the kitchen
table and told you she had a new boyfriend.

807
01:08:28,852 --> 01:08:31,947
Was I?
Oh.

808
01:08:33,557 --> 01:08:35,924
"Well, how long's
that been goin' on?" I said.

809
01:08:35,993 --> 01:08:39,258
- She said, "A week."
- That was quick. You'd only split up a week before.

810
01:08:39,329 --> 01:08:43,266
That's what I said!
How did you know?

811
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:45,358
You just told me.

812
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:48,530
Did I?
When?

813
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:50,573
Just now.

814
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:56,546
Are you sure I haven't told you
this story before?

815
01:08:56,613 --> 01:08:58,775
Not before.

816
01:08:58,849 --> 01:09:02,251
No, definitely not before.

817
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:06,552
I keep getting these flashes
like I have.

818
01:09:11,695 --> 01:09:15,256
I get very confused when I try
and talk to you seriously.

819
01:09:15,332 --> 01:09:17,528
What was he like?

820
01:09:17,601 --> 01:09:19,831
- Who?
- The boyfriend,

821
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:23,367
She said he wasn't
as nice as me.

822
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,499
He wouldn't be.

823
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:28,635
What do you mean?

824
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:33,081
She's right.
He isn't as nice as you.

825
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:35,482
- Do you know him?
- Of course I don't.

826
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:40,319
- But you...
- I don't have to know him. I know you.

827
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:48,760
I'm sorry.

828
01:09:48,832 --> 01:09:52,132
I don't think
you're all that quaint.

829
01:10:00,043 --> 01:10:05,038
1 suppose it must be nice
to be able to try one set of actions,

830
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:10,246
and then, if things
don't quite work out,

831
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,881
dispense with the outcome
of the consequences...

832
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:17,985
and try another set of actions
for better results.

833
01:10:25,702 --> 01:10:28,728
But life on Farts
is not like that.

834
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:34,710
We have to live with the consequences
of our actions.

835
01:10:38,849 --> 01:10:42,843
We are normally given
only one chance.

836
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:51,554
The wandering man was given
a second chance,

837
01:10:51,628 --> 01:10:55,428
although he only knew
about that afterwards.

838
01:11:32,669 --> 01:11:36,765
He said it was
a most peculiar thing.

839
01:11:38,675 --> 01:11:44,478
He didn't then remember any
of the things that had happened to him,

840
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:47,941
or hadn't happened,

841
01:11:48,018 --> 01:11:51,682
depending on how you look
at the past.

842
01:11:53,323 --> 01:11:56,953
I'm glad there's no time limit
on these things.

843
01:11:57,027 --> 01:11:59,155
So am I.

844
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:01,994
Yet he still felt different.

845
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:04,966
Thought differently,

846
01:12:05,035 --> 01:12:09,597
as if he'd been changed
by those events nevertheless.

847
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:27,320
But for now, for him,

848
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:30,655
there was only the present.

849
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:55,310
If it had ended there,

850
01:12:55,385 --> 01:12:58,685
if somehow they'd lived
happily ever after,

851
01:12:58,755 --> 01:13:02,055
the outcome would have been
very different.

852
01:13:03,627 --> 01:13:06,824
The consequences
much more serious.

853
01:13:08,365 --> 01:13:12,097
But it hadn't quite ended yet.

854
01:13:38,962 --> 01:13:41,124
What's the matter?

855
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:43,131
I'm sad.

856
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,133
Don't be sad.

857
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:47,829
Of course I'm sad.

858
01:13:55,478 --> 01:13:57,879
There's nothing to be sad about.

859
01:13:57,948 --> 01:14:01,714
I haven't finished
being sad yet.

860
01:14:02,886 --> 01:14:04,820
Oh.

861
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:25,005
Now I've finished!

862
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:30,610
What were you sad about?

863
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,944
I was sad about...

864
01:14:33,016 --> 01:14:37,283
if I stay, I'll never
see Epsilon again.

865
01:14:37,354 --> 01:14:41,621
And if I go,
I'll never see you again.

866
01:14:41,691 --> 01:14:44,592
Whichever one
I thought about made me sad.

867
01:14:44,661 --> 01:14:46,595
Oh.

868
01:14:48,765 --> 01:14:53,066
Which one made you less sad?

869
01:14:56,673 --> 01:15:00,405
Will you show me your
comfortable little house now?

870
01:15:00,477 --> 01:15:02,969
The one with the spare room?

871
01:15:08,184 --> 01:15:12,746
It's my hormones.
You send them out of control.

872
01:15:12,822 --> 01:15:17,157
How did you know about my comfortable
little house and the spare room?

873
01:15:18,328 --> 01:15:22,788
It's a bit... complicated.

874
01:15:23,933 --> 01:15:28,495
You told me
in our previous past.

875
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:31,404
We've got a previous past,
you and me?

876
01:15:31,474 --> 01:15:34,034
We ended up having an argument
and parting ways.

877
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:39,378
So I came back and found you before we
had the argument and here we are.

878
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:42,111
You have a fight
you wished you hadn't had,

879
01:15:42,185 --> 01:15:44,677
so you just go back
and you don't have it.

880
01:15:44,754 --> 01:15:46,813
Useful way to solve problems.

881
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,985
- What was the argument about?
- You thought I was too extreme.

882
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:53,428
I didn't!
I don't think you're extreme at all!

883
01:15:53,496 --> 01:15:57,023
- I'd never think that. Never!
- I am a bit at times.

884
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,765
You're not extreme. You just feel
passionately about things.

885
01:16:03,106 --> 01:16:05,666
Things that are important.

886
01:16:05,742 --> 01:16:09,235
- Id chopped down your childhood tree.
- You what?

887
01:16:09,312 --> 01:16:12,748
I chopped down your tree, your favorite
tree, the one you used to talk to.

888
01:16:12,816 --> 01:16:14,784
You didn't!

889
01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:18,446
- You don't mind?
- You must've had good reason.

890
01:16:21,558 --> 01:16:25,392
I've been thinking about things.
You know?

891
01:16:25,462 --> 01:16:29,922
All the things you've been saying
about the Earth and so on.

892
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:32,400
It all makes sense, but...

893
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:35,700
you tend to get a bit
depressed about it at first.

894
01:16:35,772 --> 01:16:39,504
Thinking about how just one person
doesn't make any difference at all.

895
01:16:39,576 --> 01:16:42,102
What can I do anyway?
And all that.

896
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:46,748
Then I thought about war.

897
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,518
When there's a war on,

898
01:16:52,589 --> 01:16:56,116
when their country and their
way of life are threatened,

899
01:16:56,192 --> 01:17:00,322
people don't hesitate to change
their life completely, you know?

900
01:17:00,396 --> 01:17:02,455
To risk everything.

901
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:06,196
Their job, their career,

902
01:17:06,269 --> 01:17:09,933
their life,
their family and friends.

903
01:17:10,006 --> 01:17:12,941
Dump the lot to join in the war.

904
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:15,706
They're ready
to risk everything.

905
01:17:15,778 --> 01:17:19,112
Which is how it's got to be
to win the war.

906
01:17:20,416 --> 01:17:22,612
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

907
01:17:22,685 --> 01:17:25,279
This is a war.

908
01:17:25,355 --> 01:17:27,585
This is more than a war.

909
01:17:27,657 --> 01:17:30,251
But we muck around at the edges of it
like we're just playing.

910
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:32,351
They've found me.

911
01:17:33,863 --> 01:17:37,128
What?

912
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,931
They've found me.

913
01:17:40,003 --> 01:17:42,233
This is much more serious
than any war.

914
01:17:42,305 --> 01:17:45,138
We muck around at the edges of it
like we're just playing with it.

915
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:48,769
Didn't you hear what I said?

916
01:17:48,845 --> 01:17:52,145
I heard what you said.

917
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:55,617
Tell them to go away.

918
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:57,744
I can't.

919
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:42,120
What if they decide not to take me now?
We can't just keep doing this.

920
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:46,328
You're right. We've got to think,
think clearly. Let me think.

921
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:49,235
We've got to go back
to your truck.

922
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:52,138
You know, in case
they do decide to take me,

923
01:18:52,208 --> 01:18:54,575
you're left stranded
in the middle of nowhere.

924
01:18:54,644 --> 01:18:58,911
- In the wrong time.
- Right.

925
01:18:58,982 --> 01:19:01,110
Let's go.

926
01:19:18,334 --> 01:19:21,702
Do you think if I just held on to you
the whole time that they couldn't...

927
01:19:21,771 --> 01:19:23,705
No.

928
01:19:23,773 --> 01:19:27,073
Didn't think so.

929
01:19:27,143 --> 01:19:29,669
But we could try.

930
01:19:39,889 --> 01:19:43,985
I wonder which one it is.

931
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,256
I've decided it's that one...

932
01:19:46,329 --> 01:19:48,457
at the end of
that sort of trail.

933
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:52,434
See it?
That's the one I'll be looking at.

934
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:56,200
I could wave to you.

935
01:19:59,609 --> 01:20:03,136
I think I might become
an astronomer if you go.

936
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:05,146
I wouldn't if were you.

937
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:07,148
Why not?

938
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:11,312
- You'll be out of a job in a few years' time.
- Why's that?

939
01:20:11,387 --> 01:20:14,584
This view is disappearing.

940
01:20:14,657 --> 01:20:18,685
You won't be able to see
any stars at all soon.

941
01:20:20,563 --> 01:20:24,500
- Better not become an astronomer then.
- No.

942
01:20:26,836 --> 01:20:29,806
I thought I might be able
to see you through the telescope.

943
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:38,212
What's that silly expression?

944
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:41,512
It's my "I'll be
a good father" look.

945
01:20:46,723 --> 01:20:51,752
If we weren't gonna bring children into
the world, there'd be no point saving it.

946
01:20:55,398 --> 01:21:00,097
There's no point bringing children
into the world until you've saved it.

947
01:21:04,107 --> 01:21:07,133
I think we might agree
to disagree there.

948
01:21:14,183 --> 01:21:18,381
We could go back
to when we first met...

949
01:21:18,454 --> 01:21:22,550
and just go "round and round
in time between then and now."

950
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:44,075
I don't think they're coming.

951
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:53,487
I don't feel them anymore.

952
01:21:57,326 --> 01:22:00,728
I feel you...

953
01:22:00,797 --> 01:22:03,596
and here,

954
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:08,468
but not them.

955
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:16,211
I feel...

956
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:20,011
we might do
some things together.

957
01:22:21,551 --> 01:22:24,282
It's a nice feeling.

958
01:22:24,353 --> 01:22:27,789
Whoo-hoo!

959
01:22:48,911 --> 01:22:52,745
What was that?

960
01:22:52,815 --> 01:22:54,806
I call it my sharpie dance.

961
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:25,091
It was some days
after this that I met him.

962
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:30,970
Just that one time, for the few hours
it took him to tell his story.

963
01:25:33,009 --> 01:25:36,070
Then he slept briefly, woke,

964
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:40,343
picked up his bag
and walked into the night...

965
01:25:40,416 --> 01:25:43,613
saying he had
some stories to tell,

966
01:25:43,686 --> 01:25:46,485
some stars to save.

967
01:26:05,074 --> 01:26:07,202
Did he disappear?

968
01:26:07,276 --> 01:26:12,840
No, he didn't disappear.

969
01:26:12,915 --> 01:26:18,786
A few years later,
I saw his photo in the newspaper.

970
01:26:18,854 --> 01:26:22,188
- I recognized him immediately.
- What's a newspaper?

971
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:24,522
It's a thing they used to have
before they knew better.

972
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:26,823
<i>- You're too young to know.
- I'm not too young.</i>

973
01:26:26,896 --> 01:26:31,265
In time, he began
to appear on television.

974
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:35,497
To be written about,
talked about.

975
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:40,668
Spreading his ideas
that he said weren't his ideas.

976
01:26:42,812 --> 01:26:46,976
At first, they considered him
to be a little mad himself.

977
01:26:48,384 --> 01:26:51,081
"Epsi-loon" they called Aim.

978
01:26:51,153 --> 01:26:53,178
Sounds like
they were madder than him.

979
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:56,885
Not all of them.
There were others like him.

980
01:26:56,959 --> 01:27:01,362
Over the years, as the sense
of what he was saying just...

981
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,491
just couldn't be argued against,

982
01:27:04,567 --> 01:27:07,730
they changed the way
they thought about him,

983
01:27:07,803 --> 01:27:11,205
and they gave him
a different name.

984
01:27:18,881 --> 01:27:22,840
- The Man of the Stars?
- The Man of the Stars?

985
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,789
You met the Man of the Stars?

986
01:27:26,856 --> 01:27:32,659
I did. I was really
the first person who ever met him.

987
01:27:32,728 --> 01:27:36,892
Because before that,
he wasn't him yet.

988
01:27:36,966 --> 01:27:41,164
That's amazing. You don't know
how amazing that is.

989
01:27:41,237 --> 01:27:43,228
Oh, I do!

990
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:46,036
<i>They say if it wasn't for him...</i>

991
01:27:46,108 --> 01:27:51,205
you mightn't be able
to see the stars at all today.

992
01:27:52,915 --> 01:27:56,374
And that would be
a pity, wouldn't it?

993
01:27:56,452 --> 01:27:59,012
I can see them!
