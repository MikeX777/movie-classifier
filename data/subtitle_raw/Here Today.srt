1
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:37,184
Coming through! Excuse me!

2
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:52,677
Left.

3
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,575
Stop sign, left.

4
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:47,515
One, two, three,

5
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:51,780
four, five.

6
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,147
Mr. Burnz?

7
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,976
Are you Charlie Burnz?

8
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,935
Charlie Burnz,
I'm talking to you.

9
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,807
Mr. Burnz, Charlie Burnz.

10
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,480
Sweep up a little bit.

11
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,960
Make sure all the props
are in the right spot.

12
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,267
Hey, Marge?
Hey, Charlie.

13
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:46,356
Where is everybody?

14
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,099
Charlie, it's Monday.
They're at the writers' meeting.

15
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,710
Oh, of course... Wow.

16
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:55,147
I had a long weekend.Okay. All right.

17
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,584
Take it easy. See you later.

18
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,543
Better hurry.
They're pitching new sketches!

19
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:01,545
Yeah, we made sure
to take a lot of care

20
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,547
not to offend anybody
with this next sketch,

21
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,550
so please strap in
and, uh, you know, enjoy.

22
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:08,596
Okay, so this is...
This is an infomercial

23
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,250
for a brand-new comedy album.

24
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,687
Uh, we start with shots
of planets and stars,

25
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,602
just these
beautiful shots of space.

26
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:17,779
And then, we hear a VO,
and we see a chyron.

27
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:20,695
In the tradition of George
Carlin and Richard Pryor,

28
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:22,697
we bring you
the next comedy voice.

29
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,961
And we cut to a photograph
of Stephen Hawking.

30
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,008
But we photoshopped him
in front of a brick wall.

31
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,967
So he looks like
he's at a comedy club.

32
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,144
We have a microphone
where his computer is.

33
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,234
Is it
just me, but what's the deal

34
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,105
with black holes?

35
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,240
Am I right? Ha. Ha. Ha.

36
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:47,156
You people like impressions?

37
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,687
So how do you think
the meeting went?

38
00:04:58,254 --> 00:04:59,951
Some very funny ideas.

39
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,911
But, Brad, somebody's
got to talk to Roger

40
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,347
about his inflections.

41
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,480
I know, I know.
I think he gets nervous.

42
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:07,742
No, come on.

43
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,874
Geo-rge Carlin, Rich-ard Pryor.

44
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,007
My God, Stephen Hawking
pronounced his name

45
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,052
better than he does.

46
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,663
Here's one for the new segment.

47
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,579
Or as Roger calls it,
the new "seg-ment."

48
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,494
All right,
I'll give this to the guys.

49
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:23,018
By the way, there's a new
invention called computers.

50
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:24,367
You may wanna get one.

51
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,848
You know, I had one,
but I like this.

52
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:29,372
We started out together.
I love the feel of the paper.

53
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,505
I like the fact
that the key leaves a mark

54
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,289
that wasn't there a second ago.Wow.

55
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:36,074
But I did treat myself
to one of these.

56
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:38,642
Ooh, look at you.
You know how to work it?

57
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,078
Absolutely, unless I wanna

58
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:41,972
send an e-mail, a text
or make a phone call.

59
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,734
Oh, that's not important. Not at all.

60
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,389
Wanna get something to eat?
Uh, I have a lunch date.

61
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,130
Oh, look at you, Mr. Social.

62
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:49,827
No, it's someone
who won an auction

63
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,641
to have lunch with me
at the charity event

64
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,092
for inner-city libraries.
That sounds like a blast.

65
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,538
This restaurant nice. Excuse me.

66
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,278
Oh, no. Heh.

67
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,150
Sorry. Bye.

68
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,587
Maybe you, sir. Hello. Uh...

69
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:14,678
Oh, Phil Donahue.
Nice to meet you.

70
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:18,639
- The hell was that about?
- Sir, uh, hi. Uh...

71
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,859
Oh, no, sorry, sorry
to bother you. Wrong person.

72
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:24,209
Excuse me. Bye-bye.

73
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,343
Excuse me. Are you,
by any chance, looking for me?

74
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,692
I'm Charlie Burnz.

75
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,477
You gotta be shitting me. What?

76
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,651
This was you?

77
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,523
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,438
You took some hits
along the way, huh?

79
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:38,180
Yeah, you might say that,
but that's a very old picture.

80
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,182
That was actually taken
on the Mayflower.

81
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:42,358
I did win
the shuffleboard tournament.

82
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,752
Well, belated congratulations.

83
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:47,145
I'm Emma Payge. Emma, pleasure. Sit down.

84
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,104
Sorry I'm late. Don't worry about it.

85
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,236
Not a problem.
Glad you're here.

86
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,369
Thank you for bidding
on me at the auction.

87
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:55,327
I'm so flattered
that somebody your age

88
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,068
would be a fan of my work.

89
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:58,983
Truth? Sure.

90
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,246
I don't know
who the hell you are.

91
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,118
My ex bid on you.

92
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,599
You didn't?
Nope.

93
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,862
How did this...? Well, he's an actor,

94
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,341
and he was doing a scene

95
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,256
from one of your plays
in his acting class,

96
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433
and he wanted to meet you,
so he bid.

97
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:16,218
Um, how much? Twenty-two.

98
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,527
$2200? That's fantastic.$2200, my ass!

99
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,529
Twenty-two dollars.

100
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:25,009
Twenty-two dollars
was the winning bid?

101
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,534
Mm-hm. It started at 20,

102
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,014
and then it went up
in 50-cent increments.

103
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,321
Oh, that's so sad. Heh.

104
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:35,150
Hello. Welcome to Le Monde.

105
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,369
I'll be your server.
What can I get for you?

106
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,849
Have you eaten here before? No.

107
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,590
They have
the greatest steak sandwich.

108
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,766
That's all I get.
It's fantastic.

109
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,074
That's perfect.
I'll have the seafood salad.

110
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:49,643
Okay. And for you, sir?
Um, I'm gonna have the...

111
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:52,820
Oh, can I have extra clams,
extra calamari

112
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,909
and extra crab meat?

113
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,607
Of course. And for you, sir?
I'm gonna have the...

114
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,088
Oh, and can I have
a lobster tail right on top,

115
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,786
with extra mussels?
Lots of mussels.

116
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,788
The ones from New Zealand,
not from Jersey

117
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,122
because they got black hairs.

118
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,530
Who knows what's in those?

119
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,619
That can be really toxic. Are you done?

120
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,143
There are a few species
you haven't mentioned yet.

121
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,754
Heh-heh, go ahead.

122
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,321
I'm gonna have the... Oh,
can I have a Diet Coke?

123
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,586
Heh-heh-heh.
And for you, sir?

124
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,023
I'm gonna have a tuna sandwich,
whole wheat toast,

125
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:26,070
and an iced tea. Very good.

126
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:28,551
Why would you order
a tuna sandwich when you said

127
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,292
they had
the best steak sandwiches?

128
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,860
While you were ordering half
of the Atlantic Ocean,

129
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,906
I developed a hankering for
the only fish left on the menu.

130
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,561
Heh. Touché, old man. Touché.

131
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,346
So let me ask you a question.

132
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,306
If you don't know who I am,
how come your ex didn't come?

133
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,134
I caught him cheating on me. Oh!

134
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:49,572
And he said it was because
I'm the worst lay in the world.

135
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:52,749
And trust me, he is wrong, okay?

136
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:56,840
You ought to see my moves.
It's "Circus do Lay."

137
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,626
Okay. Well, let's, uh...
Let's get through lunch first.

138
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,497
Mm-hm. I'd break
your back, old man.

139
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:04,456
Thank you. Yeah, have you laid out, dead,

140
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,284
with a smile on your face.

141
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:10,288
And your kids will be like, "How
did he die? How did my dad die?"

142
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:13,161
And I would just look at them
in their eyes and say, heh,

143
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,380
on top of me.

144
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,559
That's a really lovely thought.

145
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:23,127
Heh-heh, you funny, old man.

146
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,390
I'm glad I came, even if it was

147
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,915
to shove you
up my ex's big fat ass.

148
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,701
Now, there's a compliment
you don't hear every day.

149
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,616
Whoa, look what
the tide brought in.

150
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,662
Yeah. Thank you very much.

151
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,142
Please enjoy. Uh,
Emma, enjoy your buffet.

152
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:43,365
Mm-hm.So... I take it you like comedy.

153
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,539
Nope.

154
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,889
You don't?
Mm-mm.

155
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,588
I mean, I love to laugh,
but in real life.

156
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,328
You know what I'm saying?

157
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:52,548
Well, you know,
that's what I do in real life.

158
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:55,116
I'm a comedy writer.
You ever watch This Just In

159
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,467
on Sunday nights on Funny? Mm-mm.

160
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,208
I also, uh, write for Broadway

161
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:03,777
and, um, movies
and five books and...

162
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,866
And, um, what do you do?

163
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,521
Char... Charlie,
I don't feel so good.

164
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,872
Why is your face suddenly
bigger than it was before?

165
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:14,178
I can't feel...
I can't feel my lips.

166
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,006
Oh, God, are you
allergic to seafood?

167
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,617
I'll say maybe I am.

168
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,793
What should I do? Call the hospital.

169
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,099
What? What? Call the hospital! Call...

170
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,624
Call the... The hospital!

171
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,235
Dial the nearest hospital!
Dial the nearest hospital!

172
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,193
I do not know.
Let me check the Web.

173
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,258
Dial the nearest hospital!
Is everything all right?

174
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:34,155
Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Okay, what did you do?

175
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,505
I didn't do anything!
These are Jersey mussels!

176
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,812
What? I knew they were Jersey mussels!

177
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,684
Jersey? No! I'm from Jersey.
I need emergency. Emergency.

178
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:42,858
This is an emergency!

179
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,124
Everybody, calm down.
Everybody, relax.

180
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:51,520
We should call the ambulance. Siri!
What is wrong with you?

181
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:54,175
Ma'am, have you had an allergic
reaction to seafood before?

182
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,133
Mm-mm. You just randomly ordered,

183
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:59,093
and this is what happened?
I had a hankering.

184
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,530
Okay, just try to relax.
We're almost there.

185
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,314
You're gonna be okay.

186
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,621
Charlie? Charlie.

187
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,798
Charlie!

188
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:12,541
You're all I've got, Charlie!
Please don't leave me!

189
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:30,690
Oh, boy.

190
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,519
Mr. Burnz?

191
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,915
Oh, I'm not supposed
to fill these out.

192
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,449
What's your relation
to Miss Payge?

193
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:41,962
She won me in an auction.

194
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:44,660
Fine, don't believe me.

195
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,270
She doesn't have insurance,

196
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,751
and she really shouldn't be
leaving here by herself.

197
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,318
No insurance?

198
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,885
Okay.

199
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,061
Eleven hundred dollars?

200
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:57,455
Yes. And you'll get
the ambulance bill in the mail.

201
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,370
You can pay me on the way out.

202
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,285
Your daughter is going
to be fine.

203
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,591
My d...?

204
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,506
Great. Isn't that great?

205
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,682
She told me all about
how you adopted her

206
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,205
from that orphanage in Kenya.

207
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,077
That's very special. Oh, she told you?

208
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,426
Yeah. Yeah, well...

209
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,342
Ha-ha, well, uh, she is special.

210
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,300
Well, this is
a pretty severe reaction.

211
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:18,563
Are there other allergies
I should know about?

212
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,001
I think really you should
talk to her about that,

213
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:24,265
or I can put you in touch with
one of the elders of her tribe.

214
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:27,703
You could ask for Mbolo.

215
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:30,140
It's good that you reacted
as quickly as you did.

216
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,234
A little longer, may have
been a different story.

217
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,188
Here are her prescriptions.

218
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,363
Pharmacy is that way.

219
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,238
Six hundred dollars?

220
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,155
So a tuna sandwich
cost me close to two grand.

221
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,375
Welcome to New York, pal. What's this?

222
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:50,639
That's epinephrine. You need
to inject her within the hour.

223
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,206
And if I don't? She'll die.

224
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,294
Next.

225
00:12:56,166 --> 00:13:01,998
"Remove blue safety release
by pulling up, straight up."

226
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:04,218
Okay. What's taking so long?

227
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,829
I'm having trouble reading the
directions without my glasses.

228
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,266
And honestly,
I'm a little nervous about it.

229
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,572
Okay. Oh, no.

230
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,792
Hell, no. Put that thing down.

231
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,055
Ain't no way in hell
I'm gonna let you stab me

232
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,448
with that Lego stick while
your hand shaking like that.

233
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:18,902
You might put out
one of my eyes.

234
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,147
They said I have to do it

235
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,881
within the hour
or you'll be in trouble.

236
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:23,150
We'll just wait an hour.

237
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:24,760
If I'm not dead,
you can go home.

238
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,849
Fine. Enjoy your bloating.

239
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,028
All right. Stick me, old man.

240
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,689
Ow! God...

241
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,387
Motherf... Ow!

242
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,955
Son of a...!

243
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,478
Okay.

244
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,306
Show time's over.

245
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,007
Make me some tea, maybe it'll
help with the bloating...

246
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:57,227
"Only hold in
for a few seconds." Ah.

247
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,235
"Slippery when wet"?

248
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,455
You looked? I had to. I really...

249
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,631
I had to. That's not
something you wanna do

250
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,125
with your eyes closed.
Believe me.

251
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:12,677
It could have ended up someplace

252
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,593
we both wouldn't be happy about.

253
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,292
Thank you. I promise
I will pay you back

254
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,946
every dime that you laid out.

255
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,122
You don't have to do that.
How are you feeling?

256
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,733
Like you shot me up with
five six-hour energy drinks.

257
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,910
So I've got about a good
30 hours of energy! I'm lit!

258
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,566
Can I ask you something? Yeah.

259
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,540
Why did you tell the doctor
I was your father?

260
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:36,223
Heh, I thought it would be cool
to have a white dad.

261
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,442
Oh, and the orphanage story?

262
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,009
I was a little loopy by then.

263
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,881
I'm sure that was
the mussels talking.

264
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,795
Yup, those mussels
were definitely talking.

265
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,754
Yeah, must have been.

266
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:48,104
Well, listen,
try to get some rest.

267
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:50,628
Um, do you need anything else?
I have 20 bucks left.

268
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,283
I'll be fine.

269
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,894
Look, I wanna apologize to you

270
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,721
for saying all that stuff
about my ex.

271
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,375
I should have never done that.

272
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:01,204
You are a good man,
and that was not fair to you.

273
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:04,468
Hey, I understand. This way out?
Yep, that way.

274
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,384
Perky.
Yeah.

275
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,745
Good try.

276
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,227
Ah! All right, that's...

277
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,012
It's all right. It's a base hit.

278
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,067
Sorry, Rex. That's a match.

279
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,158
I don't know
why you play against me.

280
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:44,117
It's good aerobics. Yeah, for me.

281
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,075
I'm running around like crazy.

282
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,034
I'm gasping for air. You just...

283
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,906
You just stand at the net.
Somehow it's six-love, six-love.

284
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,212
Six-love?
Six...

285
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,344
You get perverse pleasure

286
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,868
beating your only son like this?
Yeah, a lot.

287
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,831
Listen, Dad, uh...

288
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,833
Francine wants to know

289
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,010
if you are coming
to Lindsay's bat mitzvah.

290
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:09,533
My daughter wants to know

291
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,587
if I'm coming to my
granddaughter's bat mitzvah?

292
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,016
Why wouldn't I? She says you never RSVP'd.

293
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:19,413
Why didn't she just call
instead of asking you to ask me?

294
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,241
Don't be upset.
You know how she gets.

295
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,156
It'll be a fun day.
We'll be together.

296
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,723
I don't want Lindsay to think
I wasn't gonna come.

297
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,769
Who knows
what your sister says to her?

298
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:29,597
Just give her a call.

299
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,037
This was fun.
I'll see you next week?

300
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:37,692
When I lose to you, again.

301
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,128
I gotta go.

302
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:42,044
I have a 3:00.
I'm a little nervous.

303
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:45,917
I'm submitting my design for
a new building in Union Square.

304
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:48,485
Well, it could be
a big thing for me.

305
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:50,966
I RSVP'd. I know I RSVP'd.

306
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,752
Dad, don't worry about that.
And wish me luck.

307
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,015
About what?

308
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,758
For my building, for the design.

309
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:05,024
Oh, oh, oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

310
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,722
Yeah. I'll see you.

311
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,247
I'm gonna call her right now.

312
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:13,728
Daddy! Daddy!

313
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,252
Daddy! Daddy!

314
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:19,342
I did something wrong, Daddy!

315
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:22,258
I'm scared! Daddy!

316
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,696
Daddy!

317
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:38,013
Oh, hi. This is...
Craziest thing. I...

318
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,754
I forgot what locker
I was using.

319
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:40,928
Heh-heh, that's okay.

320
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,974
I have a master. Uh...

321
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,976
Let's start with this row. Okay, good.

322
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:13,744
That's perfect.
You're gonna crush this.

323
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,703
Give me a high-five.

324
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,099
I'm proud of you.
You're doing so beautifully.

325
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:24,277
Yeah. I'm just getting a little
nervous about my speech.

326
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:27,541
Have you started writing it yet? Yeah.

327
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,630
Mmm...

328
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,676
It's your grandfather.

329
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,463
Hi, Papa Charlie. Hey, Lindsay, honey.

330
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,334
How's my favorite
bat mitzvah girl?

331
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:39,683
Good. Heh-heh.

332
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:41,163
Ask him if he's coming.

333
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,122
What do you mean?
Grandpa's not coming?

334
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,080
Are you coming? That's why I'm calling.

335
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:47,996
Of course I'm coming.

336
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,452
I wouldn't miss that
for the world.

337
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:50,868
Great. I'm so happy.

338
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,740
Hey, when you're happy,
I'm happy.

339
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,655
Um, can I speak to your mom?

340
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:57,353
Tell him I can't
talk to him right now.

341
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:00,791
Uh... She said
she'll call you back.

342
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:03,098
Yeah. Okay.

343
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,665
I can't wait to see you.

344
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,101
I can't wait to see you too.

345
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:09,104
So tell me.
You got a pretty dress?

346
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:11,019
You're gonna have to see
when you come.

347
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,673
Okay.

348
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,414
Um...

349
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,851
Can you help me with my speech?

350
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,854
Yeah, of course.
We'll punch it up real good.

351
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,770
Yeah. Okay, kid.

352
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,206
See you soon.

353
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,862
I had a bad day.

354
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:31,257
Thanks for seeing me so late.
I really appreciate it.

355
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:34,912
I, uh... I couldn't remember

356
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,480
where my locker was
in my health club.

357
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:39,221
I've been going there for years.

358
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,224
It was so damn embarrassing.

359
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,183
That should be expected.

360
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:48,926
Don't panic. Are you doing
what we talked about?

361
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,755
Yeah. I try
not to vary my routine.

362
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,194
I walk the same way
to work every day. I eat right.

363
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,892
I'm getting some exercise.

364
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,373
And, uh, I'm taking my meds.

365
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,114
And by the way, that Namenda.

366
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,117
Oh, man, it's so constipating.

367
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,597
It... Sorry about that.

368
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,512
Sorry? I was backed up
for eight days.

369
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,732
I felt like a python
that had swallowed a deer.

370
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,953
Charlie, you have medicines

371
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:18,956
to help with that, and you can
always give yourself an enema.

372
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,176
I'm saving that for my birthday.

373
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,397
A little something special
just for me.

374
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,660
How are you sleeping?

375
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:30,794
Why sleep when you can
stay up and terrorize yourself?

376
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,840
Maybe I get four hours,
but maybe.

377
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,625
And what about those flashbacks?

378
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,019
That's the craziest thing.

379
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,675
I can forget what I had for
lunch while I'm having lunch.

380
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,460
But then, something...
flies into my head, like, bam!

381
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:47,898
It could be a moment,
a fragment, a sentence.

382
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,596
And it's like I'm there.

383
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,337
Like I can see it

384
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,556
like I saw it way back then.
It doesn't...

385
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,256
It's almost like I can
smell things. And then, black.

386
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,694
It just goes black,
and it goes as fast as it came.

387
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,783
It's the craziest thing.

388
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:08,571
How's the writing going? I think it helps.

389
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:12,575
Um, it keeps my mind active, and
it helps strengthen my denial.

390
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:16,013
You know what, this show,
it's all of these young kids.

391
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:17,624
I'm like
the old man on the block

392
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:20,627
whose yard you don't
wanna hit the ball into.

393
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,499
But I still
get stuff on the air.

394
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:26,023
I still help shape the show,

395
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:29,636
and when one of my jokes hits
right, and the audience laughs,

396
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,115
there's still nothing like it.

397
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,683
And I still love it.

398
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,946
Good. I think you're doing well.

399
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,734
We're keeping this at bay,
but it's so damn unpredictable.

400
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:45,434
Don't let your denial
overrule your sense of reason.

401
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:47,175
There's a lot
we still don't know

402
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,698
about this kind of dementia.

403
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:51,657
Okay.

404
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,878
See you next month.Okay.

405
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:57,490
Unless you need me sooner.Okay.

406
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:58,969
Thanks, my friend.

407
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,757
Oh, by the way, I thought the
show last week was pretty good.

408
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,759
Was it? Who was on?

409
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:08,588
Um, you know, the guy,
what's-his-name?

410
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:12,983
The... From the film.
He's married to... Oh!

411
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:16,247
The one with the hair.

412
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:19,076
Would you like some of my meds?

413
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:54,895
You just gonna
push the lady down, huh?

414
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,897
You just gonna
run over somebody!

415
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:58,246
You son of a bitch!

416
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,291
Come back here
and try that again,

417
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:01,728
you spineless bastard!

418
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,731
Hey, hey, hey.

419
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,123
What happened?

420
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,128
I was going up the right,

421
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:14,393
when I got into a head-on
collision with a dumb-ass

422
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,569
who was coming down
on the right side,

423
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,614
but really that's his left side.

424
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,356
And it's all his fault
because this isn't England!

425
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,184
How did you know where I live?

426
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:24,968
Oh, Google.
Google?

427
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,709
Here.
What's this?

428
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:29,233
The first installment
of the money I owe you.

429
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,148
Whoa!

430
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,281
You're a pole dancer?

431
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,370
God, no. And this
coming from a man

432
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,807
that makes America laugh
for a living.

433
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,549
My knee! My fucking knees!

434
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,551
Listen, listen, come upstairs.

435
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:44,335
I'll clean you up a little bit,

436
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,381
and then we can
rinse out your mouth.

437
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:47,556
Come on.

438
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:53,083
Ooh, okay, okay.

439
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,696
Jeez.

440
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,743
Man, this dude is doing it.
This is nice.

441
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,050
Ooh! Mm, he know a lot
of old white people.

442
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,184
Oprah Winfrey? Hmm!

443
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,361
"For Carrie"?

444
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,668
Hmm.
Okay, here we go.

445
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,888
According to this wall,
not only are you ancient,

446
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,064
but you're also famous.

447
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,848
Sit here.

448
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,641
You a serial killer?

449
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,077
What do you mean?

450
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,861
Well, isn't that
what serial killers do?

451
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,124
Collect pictures
of everyone they butchered

452
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,475
and buried in their backyard?

453
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:38,215
Other knee.

454
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,438
Who are they?
Who?

455
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:48,269
Oh, that's my family.

456
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,402
If they're family, why do you
have their names written down?

457
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:53,013
I'm writing
something about them,

458
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,232
and it helps me stay focused.
That's all.

459
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,671
How did you become a writer?

460
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:02,196
I don't think you become one.
I think you just are.

461
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,111
When I was a kid,
I thought it was fun

462
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:06,896
to take the truth
and make it more interesting.

463
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,070
So you're a liar?

464
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,813
Nah, I'm just kidding.

465
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:12,032
That's beautiful.Yeah.

466
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,208
Well, you're as good as new.

467
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,601
Thanks.

468
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,691
What was here?

469
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,736
Oh, there was just
some picture that fell.

470
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,347
Housekeeper put it someplace,
I don't know.

471
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,958
Listen, I gotta
get back to work.

472
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,699
You gotta get back
to making up shit

473
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,614
because your real life
is boring?

474
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,659
Something like that, yeah.

475
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,793
Thanks for bringing me
the bag of laundered money.

476
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,838
The Corleones
will be very pleased.

477
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,537
Um... But you really
didn't have to do that.

478
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:42,149
That's where you're wrong,
old man. I did. Mwah!

479
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,454
Bye-bye.

480
00:25:45,195 --> 00:25:50,549
Next is Sarah and Roger,
Paula and Gary wrote this.

481
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:53,508
A cheesy ad for a law firm.

482
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,162
Hello, I'm Jerry Loomis.

483
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:56,816
And I'm Lorraine Loomis.

484
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,166
When we got married,
the rules of dating

485
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,734
were much less confusing
than they are today.

486
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,475
And that's where we come in.
We're the Sex Refs.

487
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,349
We go on your dates with you.

488
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,220
Maintaining a safe distance.

489
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:12,614
So if there's any hanky... Or panky.

490
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,878
We're there to help clarify what
both parties' intentions are.

491
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,837
So there's no misunderstandings

492
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:21,449
that could lead
to accusations and lawsuits.

493
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,538
We deal with the
he said-she said aspects

494
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,322
of miscommunication. For example,

495
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:27,281
You're in a parked car
and she says:

496
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:28,674
"Would you like to kiss me?"

497
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:30,371
But he said she said:

498
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,721
"Honey, can you please
stick your thumb up my ass?"

499
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,858
Very different, isn't it?

500
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,555
We think so.

501
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,210
Or if you're at the top
of the Ferris wheel,

502
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,995
and he says: "I really don't like heights."

503
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:47,649
But she says he said:

504
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,738
"Wanna see a picture
of my Rottweiler's balls?"

505
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,396
Now you see why you need us?

506
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,573
We'll be there to protect you
from vicious accusations,

507
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:01,054
subpoenas and defamation suits.

508
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:03,447
Sub-poena?
Remember we're on your side.

509
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,101
No matter what side that is.

510
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:07,060
We're Loomis. And Loomis.

511
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,844
And we'll see you in court...

512
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,759
Ship.

513
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:16,896
That's good. That was good.

514
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,941
Well, it's subtle.

515
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:20,813
So... Okay, good job.

516
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,859
Next sketch is from Darrell.

517
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,166
Thomas Crapper Jr.

518
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,169
We open on a 19th century
British schoolyard.

519
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,954
A group of 9-year-old children
are milling about

520
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:34,217
and trying to figure out
what they want to do

521
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:37,307
now that school is let out.
Wanna come over to my house?

522
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:39,570
No. Your house smells.

523
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:41,268
How about my house?

524
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:44,140
No. Your house smells too.

525
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:45,968
My house doesn't smell.

526
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,491
How come?

527
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,406
I'm Thomas Crapper Jr.

528
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,279
My father invented
the flush toilet.

529
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:55,021
Then let's go over to his house.

530
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,328
All right, all right.

531
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:03,029
All right, guys.
Very funny stuff.

532
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:05,205
Let's put together a show.

533
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,860
Sex Refs.

534
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,950
Ah. You guys wrote
a really funny sketch.

535
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,821
But, uh...

536
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:16,303
But what?
Sarah and Roger were hilarious.

537
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:18,522
Correct. I don't know. I don't know.

538
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,090
Charlie, what do you think?
Very funny idea.

539
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:23,745
But a thumb up the ass,
Rottweiler's balls...

540
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,704
What are you talking about?
They got laughs.

541
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,793
Of course they will.
They always will.

542
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,969
But is it
the right kind of laugh?

543
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,232
Because it's a very smart idea.

544
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:33,407
Angry Librarians?

545
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:34,661
So funny. You should do it.

546
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:35,975
I agree.

547
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,368
Thomas Crapper Jr.Hell, no.

548
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:41,154
Yeah. You know,
Darrell's option's coming up,

549
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,852
and he still hasn't gotten
a sketch on the air.

550
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:46,376
It's not that bad.

551
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,552
First of all, if they spoke
in English accents,

552
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,163
the way they were supposed to,

553
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,034
it would've been
a little bit better,

554
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,819
but the whole thing's
not framed right.

555
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,735
Give him another shot.
He'll make it better.

556
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:01,348
Listen, we hired Darrell
because he wrote

557
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:04,351
those really funny essays
for the Lampoon.

558
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,483
I think it's a little hard
to make the leap

559
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:08,442
from print to live sketches.
It takes time.

560
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,445
You think he's a good writer?

561
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,664
Yeah. I think...
I think it's in there.

562
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,579
But I think
it needs to be encouraged.

563
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,495
Listen, you guys are
a very fast crowd to run with,

564
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,281
and I also think that
Inflection Mangler Roger

565
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:24,110
should be hit in the head
until he says "subpoena" right.

566
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,503
I mean, come on.
"Sub-poena," what is that?

567
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:27,853
A very small poena?

568
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,506
That's an inferior poena.

569
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,727
An underground poena?
I mean, what is his problem?

570
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:35,730
You know, but here's the thing.

571
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:37,384
There's a music to comedy.

572
00:29:37,558 --> 00:29:39,516
There's a music.
There are notes to comedy.

573
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,210
He's out of tune. We're working on it.

574
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:43,825
Keep working,
because it's driving me nuts.

575
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:46,959
All right. What's next? Uh, I have to go.

576
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,004
I'm sorry, I have my... Oh, oh!

577
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,353
Excuse me.
Oh, right.

578
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,442
Yeah. Have a great time.

579
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:55,184
Thanks.Oh. I wish I could go.

580
00:29:55,358 --> 00:29:57,491
Hey. You got a job. Ha-ha! Yeah. All right.

581
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,927
Good night. Good night.

582
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:00,799
Good night.

583
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:03,802
They're, um...
They're honoring Charlie

584
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,326
and the whole cast
at the American Film Society

585
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,372
for the 30th anniversary
of Call Me Anytime.

586
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,984
Kevin Kline, Sharon Stone,
Barry Levinson directing.

587
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:15,248
Oh. Such a funny movie.
Have you seen it?

588
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:16,902
Mm-hm.Yeah. It's great.

589
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,427
All right. What's up?

590
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:24,692
Look, you know I love Charlie.

591
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,868
I know he gave you
your start and everything.

592
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,131
But... come on.

593
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:32,308
Yeah, I just don't know what
he brings to the show anymore.

594
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:35,094
Aside from 40 years' experience?

595
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,400
And a body of work
that includes shows

596
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:40,360
that made it possible
for this show to exist?

597
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:44,059
Look, I know

598
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:47,367
how you can question
Charlie's value.

599
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:51,240
But he's really smart
and he still writes funny jokes.

600
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:53,590
And he's my consigliere.

601
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:57,551
So when you write sketches
with a thumb up someone's ass,

602
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,814
or a Rottweiler's balls,

603
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:03,731
he's the one who reminds me what
we should be putting on the air.

604
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:07,474
Bottom line, as long as
I am producing this show,

605
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,171
Charlie will be here.

606
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:13,219
Okay? You got it.

607
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:15,264
All right.Yeah.

608
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,092
Let's get back to work.Yeah.

609
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,451
Come on, come on.

610
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:32,368
Close the door, close the door.

611
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:36,068
Turn off the lights.

612
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,286
Come here.

613
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:42,813
I can't do this anymore.

614
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:44,598
Why? Oh!

615
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:47,601
You're married, I'm married.
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

616
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:48,994
Well, neither do I.

617
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,998
Mm, I just don't know
what to do.

618
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:55,914
But wait, wait, wait.
Let's make a plan.

619
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:59,961
Every year, we will meet
here in the Tuckmans' bathroom,

620
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:02,355
at their Halloween party.

621
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,226
What about the Tuckmans'
Christmas party?

622
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,749
No, we've got to be strong.

623
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:12,974
Hi, how are you?
Thank you all for being here.

624
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,976
Good evening, I'm Bob Costas.

625
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,892
Please welcome

626
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,112
the director of Call Me Anytime,

627
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:21,374
Barry Levinson.

628
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,724
Its writer, Charlie Burnz,

629
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:27,771
and its stars,
Kevin Kline and Sharon Stone.

630
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:37,216
I have to say,
right off the top.

631
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,522
I really love this film.

632
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:42,047
In fact, I'm bypassing
a Mets-Astros game tonight

633
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,440
just to be here,
to do this instead.

634
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:46,616
All right,
so, what's the germ of all this?

635
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,575
How did it all get started?

636
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:51,186
Well, um, Charlie and I
originally met

637
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,015
on The Carol Burnett Show
ages ago.

638
00:32:54,189 --> 00:32:57,888
And, uh, he wrote
a lot of very funny sketches.

639
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:02,284
Shy guy, uh,
always called me Mr. Levinson.

640
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,298
Even though we were friendly.

641
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,332
All right,
so, what happened was, um,

642
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:09,204
I read Charlie's script
and, uh, I thought:

643
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,598
"Well, this is
a perfect film to do."

644
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,905
So the next day, I get a call
from Barry, and he says:

645
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,038
"I just read this script,
it's terrific.

646
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,867
You gotta read it.
The character, she's you."

647
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,651
And I said,
"She's completely compulsive,

648
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,566
she'll do anything. I'm in."

649
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:28,093
And then the next day,
he called me.

650
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:31,313
I read the script
and then I was in.

651
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:34,229
Literally three days later,
we got a go.

652
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,492
And I called Charlie
with the good news.

653
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:40,192
And so, Charlie, you get
the call, what did Barry say?

654
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:43,586
Who? Heh, Mr. Levinson.

655
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,979
Oh, heh.

656
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:48,809
It's so nice to see you.
Nice to... Wow.

657
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:51,594
It's great to meet you.
Well, I was...

658
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:54,423
I was just thrilled
and shocked that, um...

659
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,208
Mr. Levinson.

660
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:58,731
Uh...

661
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:01,430
Wanted to direct my first...

662
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:03,215
This was my first screenplay.Yes.

663
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:08,307
And that Kevin Kline was gonna
play Ben, and that... Help me.

664
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,352
Meryl Streep.Hello.

665
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:13,660
Heh, was, uh, gonna play Iris.

666
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:16,793
And I kept thinking,
if my parents were alive,

667
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,578
this good news
would've killed them.

668
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,103
Charlie's work is...

669
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:25,150
It's not just comedic,
there's a humanity to it.

670
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:28,631
And I think it shows
people as real people.

671
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,372
He's an exceptional writer.

672
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,601
Hey, old man.
You were great up there.

673
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:44,212
Hey. You were inside?

674
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:47,737
Yeah. And I loved it.
Second installment.

675
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:50,871
It's a little light, boss.
Please don't break my thumbs.

676
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,700
Well, this is a...

677
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,093
This is a lovely surprise.

678
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,834
How'd you know about this? My loser ex.

679
00:34:58,008 --> 00:35:00,837
I used his ticket.
You made me laugh a lot.

680
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,012
I'm really sorry.

681
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:06,887
No, I liked seeing you
up there. It was so cool.

682
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,802
And you've done
a lot of big things.

683
00:35:08,976 --> 00:35:10,760
I got lucky. Being good

684
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,328
ain't got
nothing to do with luck.

685
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:14,677
I guess.

686
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:18,072
Why do you have birds
in your hair?

687
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:19,465
Why not?

688
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,510
Oh, shit, what time is it?

689
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,251
Damn! I'm gonna
be late for work.

690
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,774
I gotta go. Come with me. Work?

691
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:25,948

711
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:25,574
Yeah, I come from
a pretty small family. Uh...

712
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:28,969
My mom and dad were singers.

713
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,884
Uh, Mo and Jessie.

714
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,016
They were kind of like
Ashford and Simpson.

715
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,714
But they never made it big

716
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:37,020
because there was already
an Ashford and Simpson.

717
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:39,893
We used to have a lot of fun.

718
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,634
They taught me how to harmonize,

719
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:45,899
and my dad made these
really cool weathervanes.

720
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,553
And my mom, she had

721
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:50,295
these beautiful dreamcatchers
that she makes.

722
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,122
They live
just outside of Charlotte.

723
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:53,863
I love them both to pieces.

724
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:55,561
Oh, they sound great.

725
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:02,394
I love the way the air smells
after it rains. Hmm.

726
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,831
Listen, if you ever need my help

727
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,963
with what you're going through
right now,

728
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:09,836
even if you need someone
to talk to, I'm here.

729
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,883
Well, thank you very much.
But what are you talking about?

730
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:16,930
You forgot Sharon Stone
and Barry Levinson's names?

731
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:18,758
Oh, that.
I get a little tongue-tied.

732
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:21,456
I don't like being on-stage.
And what stage were you on

733
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,830
when you wrote your family's
names under their pictures?

734
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,330
I told you, that's how I work.

735
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,375
It's a project
that I'm working on, and...

736
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:30,770
Look, I know what you told me,
but don't bullshit me, old man.

737
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,298
It started innocently enough.

738
00:37:37,472 --> 00:37:39,082
I'd have trouble
remembering things.

739
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:42,303
A name, a place, a fork.

740
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:44,479
And I'd think,
"You're getting older, Charlie.

741
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:47,003
You know,
you're having senior moments."

742
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:49,179
But one day,
I'm having lunch with this guy,

743
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,007
and I can't remember his name.

744
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:52,966
He's going on and on and on.

745
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,620
I'm thinking,
"Who the hell is this?"

746
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:57,013
Then he cracks himself up
and he starts laughing.

747
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,799
So I faked laughing.
Just to go along with him.

748
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:02,715
And while I'm laughing,
I'm panicking.

749
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:05,195
Thinking,
"Who the hell is this?"

750
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,719
Did you know him?

751
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:09,852
He was my son.

752
00:38:13,943 --> 00:38:16,946
Yeah. It's happening.

753
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:21,255
Jesus, old man. I'm sorry.

754
00:38:27,043 --> 00:38:28,043
Who's Carrie?

755
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:33,136
I saw that on the title page
at your house.

756
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,488
Carrie was my wife.

757
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:38,925
She died.

758
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,058
A long time ago.

759
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:48,151
And I'm writing
something for her.

760
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,545
And I have to finish
before my words run out.

761
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:53,156
When did you start
working on it?

762
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,637
About an hour
after I was diagnosed.

763
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,465
And how's it going so far?

764
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,772
It's going really well.

765
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:02,949
My mama would call that
a crock of lukewarm horseshit.

766
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:05,081
Don't lie to me, old man.

767
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:08,607
I know you haven't started
writing one single word.

768
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:10,478
Let me see your phone. My phone?

769
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:11,958
Your phone.
Okay.

770
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,135
Okay.

771
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:18,791
This is my name,
this is my number, okay?

772
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:20,749
Now, even if you don't
wanna contact me,

773
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,403
I just want you to know

774
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:25,798
that I'm not some
allergic-to-shellfish nut

775
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,626
that's half your age plus four,

776
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,411
that wants to help you
because you helped me.

777
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,674
You don't
stop for commas, do you?

778
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:34,154
Life's too short for commas.

779
00:39:41,335 --> 00:39:44,599
Darrell, um, this is better.

780
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,167
Try this as a tag.

781
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:49,865
Let's do it in the dress
rehearsal. What do you think?

782
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,478
Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

783
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,131
Are we good? Yeah. Thanks.

784
00:39:55,305 --> 00:39:57,482
Good. Alrighty. All right.

785
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:59,745
Want to
come to my house and play?

786
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,747
No, your house smells.

787
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,813
Come to my house and play.

788
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:07,056
No, your house smells too.

789
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,190
My house doesn't smell.

790
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:11,670
We can play there.

791
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:13,672
Oh, he's Thomas Crapper's son.

792
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:16,239
His father invented
the flushing toilet.

793
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,677
That's a lot of crap.

794
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:21,027
Not anymore.

795
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,856
Let's go to his house!

796
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,162
Ah, yes. Thomas Crapper,

797
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:29,165
the, uh, father
of the modern toilet.

798
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,819
I'm Jeff Goldblum.

799
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,866
Uh... Oh, heh-heh-heh.

800
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,695
This has been

801
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:41,047
a little-known moment
in indoor plumbing history.

802
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:46,226
Change your toilet.
Change the world.

803
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:49,055
Commercial break! Two minutes.

804
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,232
Wow.

805
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:54,016
Not bad. Great fix, Darrell.

806
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,279
Yeah, the Goldblum thing
was funny.

807
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,673
Thanks. I think we'll slot it

808
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:01,502
after the third commercial
break. Got one on the air.

809
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:02,851
All right, so...

810
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,507
Yeah. Yeah.

811
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,490
How did you meet Carrie?

812
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:45,503
Come on, old man.
How did you two meet?

813
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,338
Damn it, I hate this stuff.

814
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,039
Hey, you know
what really does the trick?

815
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:01,257
What?

816
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,085
Butter.

817
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,523
Did you just say butter?
I'm telling you. Butter.

818
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:08,438
No, really. There's a lot of tar
on the beach this year.

819
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:10,571
What you do
is you take a stick of butter

820
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:12,573
and just keep rubbing it
into the tar

821
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:16,098
and somehow it breaks it down,
you can just wipe it away

822
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,666
and you don't have to use
that tomahawk of a shell,

823
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,755
which is probably taking off
all the epidermis

824
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:22,975
on the bottom of your foot.

825
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:24,933
Hi.Hi.

826
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:27,762
I'm Charlie Burnz. Hello, Charlie Burnz.

827
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:32,375
I'm Carrie. Carrie? Is that short

828
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,640
for Caren or Carina
or a Catherine or...?

829
00:42:35,814 --> 00:42:37,642
Florence. Florence?

830
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,295
Don't ask.

831
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:41,950
Florence. Well, that's
a great old-fashioned name.

832
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:44,300
That's one of the names
of one of my relatives.

833
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:47,129
I could never imagine
my relatives as babies.

834
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:48,696
Herman, come away
from the water.

835
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,829
Irving, don't put that
puppy in your mouth.

836
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:52,744
Ooh, Mildred just pooped
in the toilet.

837
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:54,441
A big hand for Mildred.

838
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,486
You don't hear those names.

839
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:58,097
That's true.

840
00:42:59,707 --> 00:43:02,057
Listen, I live in
that white house,

841
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:04,233
like, right over there,
and I happen to have

842
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:07,193
like half a ton of butter.
So if you...

843
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,064
Yeah, I won a dairy contest.

844
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:11,676
You had to guess
how much the cow weighed.

845
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,113
And, uh, I can de-tar you.

846
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,811
And I mean that
in a very respectful way.

847
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,901
Okay.

848
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:29,258
Wow, is that a paint-by-number?

849
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:33,523
Oh, it's you again.
Hello, Charlie Burnz.

850
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:36,396
Hey, Carrie. It's really good.

851
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,006
Yeah? You like it? Yeah.

852
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,660
You know what else I like? What?

853
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:41,967
Steamed clams. Oh, yeah?

854
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,447
Yeah. I've never had steamed clams.

855
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,667
Okay, my house, 7 p.m.

856
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,062
Deal.

857
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:52,847
Here we go. Okay, take the clam.

858
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:55,937
Spread it apart.
Rinse him in the broth.

859
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:59,419
And then to the butter.
And then to your mouth.

860
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,813
It's a little bit of heaven.
Isn't it great?

861
00:44:01,987 --> 00:44:03,945
Oh. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

862
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,381
Oh, God, that's disgusting.

863
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:07,209
Please don't sue.

864
00:44:07,383 --> 00:44:09,559
Oh, man.

865
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,866
Pizza? I'll call Gino's.

866
00:44:25,184 --> 00:44:26,881
I just got this rug.

867
00:44:28,143 --> 00:44:29,841
This is like tracking Bigfoot.

868
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:36,803
Hey.

869
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:39,764
Hey. Carrie.

870
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:42,288
Good morning.

871
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:48,033
Here.

872
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:51,776
Good morning, Charlie Burnz.

873
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,998
Here. A little something
for breakfast.

874
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:58,826
It's a beautiful day.

875
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:05,354
Ha-ha! Oh, God.

876
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:09,924
Okay.

877
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:13,449
De-tar me.

878
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:16,888
But it seems a shame to waste
the butter on my foot.

879
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:18,759
Oh! Come here.

880
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:20,152
Okay.

881
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,330
Hi.

882
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,391

make sure you make a donation.

898
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:18,226
Thank you,
we'll see you in a few months.

899
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,619
We're going on tour.

900
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:22,578
A tour. Four months, 50 cities.

901
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:24,798
Theaters, clubs.
And we got a tour bus.

902
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,669
Can you believe it? Man, it's awesome.

903
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,410
I'm in, all the way.Awesome.

904
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:30,282
All right, guys,
I'll see you later.

905
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:31,849
See you. That's cool.

906
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:34,677
You sounded great.

907
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:38,681
What are you doing here? Em, I'm sorry.

908
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,988
I messed up. Please.

909
00:47:41,162 --> 00:47:44,862
It's too late. I've moved on.
I met someone and we're in love.

910
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:46,559
What? Already?

911
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:47,952
Mm-hm.
Bullshit.

912
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:49,867
He's over there. Wanna meet him? Okay.

913
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,761
Come on, you'll see
if it's bullshit or not.

914
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,087
Let's see your bullshit.

915
00:47:53,261 --> 00:47:54,872
Hey. Hey, old man.

916
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,570
Hi. Hey, you were great.
I mean, that was just terrific.

917
00:47:57,744 --> 00:47:59,398
Thank you. What is going on here?

918
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:04,316
Oh. Charlie, this is my
ex-boyfriend, Dwayne St. John.

919
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,666
Oh, I hear you're a fan.
Thank you.

920
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,625
This is your boyfriend? No, he's my bae.

921
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:12,715
You used my auction thing!
Oh, yeah, all $22 of it.

922
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,588
And thank you. It's the first
day of the rest of my life.

923
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:17,285
Ain't that right?

924
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:19,026
Yeah. Heh-heh.

925
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,464
I love everything you do.
And now he's doing me. Ha!

926
00:48:22,638 --> 00:48:24,292
Ain't that right, Charlie?

927
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:27,513
You got that right... baby.Mm-hm.

928
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:29,602
We are late for lunch.Uh-huh.

929
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:33,562
And I would love
a seafood salad right now.

930
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,825
Okay. This is so crazy.

931
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,394
I'm... In acting class, I was
doing the scene from your play...

932
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:41,570
Do you wanna
just take a picture?

933
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:43,442
Could I? Okay with you, sir? Sure.

934
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:45,270
Man, this is amazing. I'll take it.

935
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:47,620
I know the password already.

936
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:50,101
All right, get closer.

937
00:48:50,275 --> 00:48:51,493
Okay, now, smile.

938
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:52,973
Put your hands up in the air.

939
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:54,888
Yeah, like you won something.

940
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:56,324
Aah! ha-ha!
Mm-hm.

941
00:48:56,498 --> 00:48:58,218
There you go. Okay.
Charlie, come over here.

942
00:48:58,326 --> 00:48:59,893
Is this good enough?

943
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:04,028
Now you'll always remember

944
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:06,595
what me and your idol
look like together.

945
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:08,032
Bye-bye.

946
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:16,779
You okay? I will be.

947
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,608
I want some ice cream.Okay.

948
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:22,220
And a triple vegan delight.

949
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:24,613
Wow, that looks like
the Olympic torch.

950
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:27,094
Hey, I gotta change the name.

951
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:33,274
So when would you leave?

952
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:36,451
In like a month or so.
It's crazy how things happened.

953
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:40,934
This record producer
saw our videos and...

954
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:43,676
he was digging us,
next thing you know, bam!

955
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,332
We going on tour
for four months, on a tour bus,

956
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:50,422
and we're already talking
about doing an album, it's...

957
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:52,728
Charlie, I'm sorry.
I'm doing all the talking.

958
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,948
You said
something good happened?

959
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:58,038
I wrote last night. You did?
That's awesome.

960
00:49:58,212 --> 00:50:00,040
It was fantastic.
Just like the old days.

961
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:03,522
Itzhak Perlman starting playing,
and I started writing.

962
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:05,263
Izzy Perlman?
Who's Izzy Perlman?

963
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:06,829
Not Izzy Perlman.

964
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,789
Izzy Pearlman
sold my parents Venetian blinds.

965
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:12,444
Itzhak Perlman is
one of the greatest violinists

966
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:15,142
in the world.
Ask your phone who he is!

967
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:16,839
He lives
in the building behind me

968
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,711
and he likes
to practice at night.

969
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:21,888
I just open my window and it's
like a free Itzhak festival.

970
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:24,934
It's one of the reasons
Carrie and I bought the place.

971
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:28,808
Ooh!

972
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:32,420
What was that for?

973
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,466
I don't think
I would've written anything

974
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,163
if you didn't get me started.

975
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,732
You're welcome. Thank you.

976
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,168
Tink.

977
00:50:42,691 --> 00:50:44,258
Hey, um...

978
00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:45,912
Are you doing
anything right now?

979
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:48,828
No.
It's my day off.

980
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:50,047
Wanna have some laughs?

981
00:50:50,221 --> 00:50:52,571
Hell, yeah.
Come on.

982
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:55,878
Wax museum? CHARLIE:
Trust me, it's fun.

983
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,011
Don't tell me
there's one of you here.

984
00:50:58,185 --> 00:50:59,505
Come on. EMMA: Heh, okay.

985
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:03,625
This is Marilyn Monroe
from The Seven Year Itch.

986
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,236
Mm. I'd be itchy too

987
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,977
if I had hot subway air
blowing up my ass.

988
00:51:08,152 --> 00:51:09,849
Is that who I think it is?

989
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:13,374
Hello, Dalai.

990
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:15,811
Come on, queen.
Smile, girl. Smile.

991
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:19,598
What could he
possibly be thinking?

992
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,080
"Shouldn't have had
the seafood salad."

993
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:26,648
Picasso. EMMA: I don't dig him.

994
00:51:26,822 --> 00:51:27,823
Why? Sexist.

995
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,347
If I did a painting of you

996
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:30,976
with three willies,
would you be happy?

997
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,741
I'd be ecstatic.

998
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:35,004
The Theory of Relativity

999
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,963
is never lend
your relatives money.

1000
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:39,226
You can kiss
that ten bucks goodbye.

1001
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,251
Golda,
tell me again. I don't understand.

1002
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:45,730
Okay, Mr. Arafat.

1003
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:47,887
It's "Chanukah,"
not "Hanukkah."

1004
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,647
I'm having
trouble with the "hucch."

1005
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,630
I'm having trouble
with the "hucch"!

1006
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:54,720
Pope? Party of five?

1007
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:56,461
I am not a crook.

1008
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:58,178
Oh, bullshit, Dickie.

1009
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:00,117
Then why are you so sweaty?

1010
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:02,225
Man, he is really cross-eyed.

1011
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:03,922
That's why he didn't find

1012
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:05,644
any weapons of mass destruction.

1013
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:10,518
So you have two kids, right?

1014
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:13,913
Yeah. Francine teaches math at
a middle school in New Jersey.

1015
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:16,307
Uh-huh. And my son Rex is an architect.

1016
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:19,092
And, uh, Rex is a...

1017
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,920
He's a pretty brilliant kid.

1018
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:22,487
Well, he should be.
He was born

1019
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:24,301
at the American Museum
of Natural History.

1020
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:28,319
This was so nice. Thank you.

1021
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:33,715
I wanna ask you a question.

1022
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,587
And I'm a little nervous
about it,

1023
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:39,025
because I don't remember the
last time I asked this, if ever.

1024
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,291
Would like to be my date for
my granddaughter's bat mitzvah?

1025
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:47,076
Her name is Lindsay
and she's the love of my life.

1026
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,296
And it would be like
a goodbye party for you,

1027
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,385
except it's a bat mitzvah
and not for you.

1028
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,954
I've never been to a bat mitzvah
before. When is it?

1029
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:57,783
I don't remember, but it's soon.
Way to narrow it down.

1030
00:52:57,957 --> 00:53:01,221
I have the invitation... Doesn't
matter when it is.

1031
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:03,005
I'd be happy to go. Yeah?

1032
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,704
But only on one condition. What's that?

1033
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:07,706
That we dance together. Oh, no, no, no.

1034
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,925
You don't understand.
I'm a dangerous dancer,

1035
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:11,797
one of the few
with mambo insurance.

1036
00:53:11,971 --> 00:53:15,366
Oh, come on, Charlie.
It'll be so much fun.

1037
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,585
All right. But to be
on the safe side,

1038
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:19,326
wear a helmet and shoulder pads.

1039
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,285
Done.
Great.

1040
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:51,228
What's the matter, Carrie?

1041
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:53,578
I just don't want
the summer to be over.

1042
00:53:53,752 --> 00:53:55,580
Well...

1043
00:53:55,754 --> 00:53:58,322
maybe we just keep
our summer going forever.

1044
00:54:00,715 --> 00:54:02,239
Good idea, Charlie Burnz.

1045
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:27,612
Stop sign... Left.

1046
00:54:27,786 --> 00:54:30,092
Whoa, sorry, pal.
You can't go this way. Not safe.

1047
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,226
This is the way I go. Sir, go this way.
Not safe here.

1048
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,098
I don't know that way.
You gotta go that way.

1049
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:39,014
I don't know that way,
this is the way I go every day.

1050
00:54:39,188 --> 00:54:41,495
It's a new day. Cross the street
and you'll be fine.

1051
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:45,107
No! I have to go this way!
Hey, pal, come on. Move!

1052
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,416
Sorry.

1053
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,244
What's the matter with you?

1054
00:54:55,248 --> 00:54:59,165
That's the way I go.
I go that way.

1055
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:07,129
What, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

1056
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,219
Get the hell out of the way!

1057
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,917
Hey!

1058
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,441
You, old man!

1059
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:16,400
Get the hell out of the way!

1060
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:18,793
You're in
the middle of the road!

1061
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,534
What, are you deaf?

1062
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,228
Hey, old man! Am I crazy

1063
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:04,883
or did you say
your son was born in a museum?

1064
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:09,627
Look at the size
of this thing, honey.

1065
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:11,846
Charlie... This
is the only thing here

1066
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,545
that's bigger than you.
Look at that wishbone!

1067
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,634
Charlie. What?

1068
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:19,201
I think my water just broke. What?

1069
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,290
We gotta get you out of here.

1070
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:22,988
We gotta get you out of here.

1071
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:25,033
Oh!

1072
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:27,775
I'm not gonna make it. Oh!
Honey... I need a doctor!

1073
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,908
I need a doctor! What's the problem?

1074
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:31,431
My wife's having a baby. When?

1075
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:33,041
Now! I'm gonna ask the supervisor

1076
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,043
if that's okay. Are you kidding me?

1077
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:36,741
I am a doctor. What kind?

1078
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:38,656
Proctologist. Okay. Close enough.

1079
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:40,875
Oh, God.
Oh, this baby's coming fast.

1080
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:43,409
Can you do it somewhere else?
A tour group's coming through.

1081
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:45,402
Really?! I have
a baby coming through!

1082
00:56:45,576 --> 00:56:47,665
Take a deep breath. Relax.
Call an ambulance now.

1083
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,623
Copy that. DOCTOR: Hi.

1084
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:51,277
You should know my name.
It's Carrie.

1085
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:52,757
Hi. Hello. And that man

1086
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:54,846
who looks so scared is Charlie!

1087
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,457
Hi, Charlie. He's the daddy.

1088
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:58,850
Good. What's your name?

1089
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:00,765
I'm Joe Katz. Okay?
Take a breath.

1090
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:02,723
Relax. You're doing just great.

1091
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:05,334
Now, listen. I'll need
to remove your underwear.

1092
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,162
Oh, that's a bit aggressive

1093
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:08,947
for our first date,
don't you think?

1094
00:57:09,121 --> 00:57:11,123
There we go.

1095
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:12,951
What should I do next? CHARLIE: Nothing!

1096
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,866
Sure? They gave us
a class with the doll...

1097
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,694
Leave us alone! Okay. Sorry.

1098
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:20,045
Charlie. This is like that time
at Rye Playland, remember?

1099
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:22,830
At the top of the Ferris wheel?
We were so drunk!

1100
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:24,441
Are you okay?

1101
00:57:24,615 --> 00:57:26,225
Just trying to think.

1102
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:28,290
Who took your panties off
at Rye Playland? I wasn't there.

1103
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:29,968
What? It was Coney Island!

1104
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:31,883
Oh, you're right!

1105
00:57:32,057 --> 00:57:34,320
Oh, God. Okay, lean forward slowly.

1106
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:36,670
And you're gonna push
when I tell you.

1107
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:39,281
Carrie, you're doing great.
Hey! What are you looking at?

1108
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,153
Ew! Get these scouts out of here!

1109
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:42,807
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1110
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:45,723
Come on, boys. This is bullshit!

1111
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:47,817
You too! Copy that.
And just a reminder:

1112
00:57:47,986 --> 00:57:49,509
We close at 5.Get out of here!

1113
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:51,772
Okay. The baby's here.

1114
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:53,208
The baby's here.

1115
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:55,384
So a big, deep breath
and a big push, okay?

1116
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,691
You can do it. There you go.Okay.

1117
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:08,789
Okay. Here you go. Here you go.

1118
00:58:08,963 --> 00:58:10,661
Here you go. Oh!

1119
00:58:10,835 --> 00:58:13,881
It's a boy.
It's a boy. It's a boy.

1120
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,146
Hey, Charlie.

1121
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,321
Yeah?

1122
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,455
Let's name him Rex.

1123
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:26,677
That's the perfect name.

1124
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:29,593
Heh, I'm really glad

1125
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:31,551
we didn't have him
under that big whale.

1126
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:34,467
Yeah. Because Moby Dick Burnz

1127
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:36,817
would be
a terrible name for our son.

1128
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:39,037
He'd have
so much trouble at school.

1129
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:43,302
Oh, I love you, Charlie Burnz.

1130
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,524
I love you too.

1131
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:11,504
What do my baby boy
and a T-Rex have in common?

1132
00:59:13,245 --> 00:59:16,814
One is extinct,
the other just stinks!

1133
00:59:20,034 --> 00:59:23,908
All right, Roger.
We'll cue you in five, four...

1134
00:59:24,082 --> 00:59:27,128
Three, two, one...

1135
00:59:27,302 --> 00:59:29,043
Good evening.
And welcome to another episode

1136
00:59:29,217 --> 00:59:31,524
of Old People Who Have
Always Looked Old!

1137
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:33,352
Tonight's subjects
are Keith Richards

1138
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:34,962
and the late Mother Teresa.

1139
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:37,225
Oh, boy. Did you hear it? Yeah. I did.

1140
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:39,314
How does he get away with this?
I don't know.

1141
00:59:39,488 --> 00:59:41,969
All right, listen.

1142
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:43,449
These sketch ideas are good,

1143
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:45,538
but they don't always
have to be so big.

1144
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:47,845
Sketches can be small,
more personal.

1145
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,194
Something about yourself,

1146
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:50,978
maybe about your
girlfriend or something.

1147
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:53,154
That would be a problem. Why is that?

1148
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:56,114
I don't have one.
I'm incredibly single.

1149
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:57,594
See? That's funny.

1150
00:59:57,768 --> 01:00:00,118
That I eat every meal alone?

1151
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,642
Oh, that's hilarious. Heh, no, no.

1152
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:04,862
I'm talking about
a character for the show.

1153
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:06,472
The incredibly single guy.

1154
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,126
It's different
than being single.

1155
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,518
It's incredibly single.

1156
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,213
There might be
something funny in that.

1157
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:13,087
Right. Find out what's funny about you

1158
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:16,395
and then write about it.Okay.
I'll try that.

1159
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:19,180
Okay. Can I tell you something?

1160
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:20,791
Yeah.

1161
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:23,271
When I was at Harvard,
I had a humor class

1162
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,230
and I wrote a paper as you.

1163
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,493
Really?
Yeah.

1164
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,277
I read all your plays,

1165
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:30,975
I knew your movie scripts.

1166
01:00:31,149 --> 01:00:32,846
I could even tell
what jokes were yours

1167
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,805
on whatever TV show
you were writing on.

1168
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:36,633
So I wrote a paper
in your style.

1169
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,199
Like youwere at Harvard.

1170
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:42,116
Wow. And how did it do? Got an F.

1171
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,597
The professor said

1172
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:46,294
we already have
a great Charlie Burnz.

1173
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:50,081
We don't have a great
Darrell Green yet. He was right.

1174
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:53,258
Anyway, um, working with you
and knowing you

1175
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:54,955
is really special to me.

1176
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:56,870
Oh, thank you, Darrell.

1177
01:00:57,044 --> 01:00:59,960
Listen, while I go
get one of the crew

1178
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:02,746
to vacuum out the smoke
you just blew up my ass,

1179
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,835
take a whack at
the incredibly single guy,

1180
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:06,837
see if there's something funny.Deal.

1181
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:08,012
Good.

1182
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:09,709
Oh, sorry.

1183
01:01:09,883 --> 01:01:13,060
Um... Hello? Hi.

1184
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:14,975
Hi, yeah. No, I...

1185
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:18,152
What to wear?

1186
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:20,502
Oh, I don't...

1187
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,505
Well, how vintage?
That's very vintage.

1188
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,768
Yeah, heh-heh.

1189
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:26,595
No, listen, uh... I'm at work,

1190
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,336
so can I call you back?

1191
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,730
Okay. Uh, bye.

1192
01:01:34,038 --> 01:01:37,476
I'm taking a date to
my granddaughter's bat mitzvah.

1193
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,784
She's a... really fun person.
Never been to one before.

1194
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:43,656
Neither have I. Can I go too?

1195
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,224
I think one surprise for my
family is all they can handle.

1196
01:01:46,398 --> 01:01:48,792
And believe me, this young
woman is full of surprises.

1197
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:50,707
She sounds cool. Yeah, she is.

1198
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:53,144
She's, uh... She's very cool.

1199
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,714
What?
Well...

1200
01:01:57,888 --> 01:01:59,150
you're blushing.

1201
01:01:59,324 --> 01:02:01,805
Your face is a little red. Oh, that's...

1202
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:03,676
blood pressure. Yeah.Oh.

1203
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,722
Shouldn't have had
the hot dog. Heh, it's...

1204
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:07,898
See you in a little bit.Bye.

1205
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:11,945
Now that I'm a bat mitzvah girl,

1206
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:14,774
um, I'd like to leave you
with this one story.

1207
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:17,864
So I turned
to Rabbi Teplis and I said:

1208
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,432
"I've been studying
for years and years,

1209
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:22,826
and I ask you:
'What is the meaning of life?'

1210
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,263
And you tell me
life is a cookie?"

1211
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,747
And Rabbi Teplis
looked at me and said:

1212
01:02:30,921 --> 01:02:32,226
"You mean it isn't?"

1213
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:41,845
So anyways, to my parents,
I love you so much.

1214
01:02:43,237 --> 01:02:44,935
You've given me
everything I have,

1215
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:48,329
and I wouldn't
be here without you.

1216
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:51,768
Thank you so much. I love you.

1217
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:54,466
Mazel tov!

1218
01:03:01,386 --> 01:03:03,605
Let's get Lindsay
up in the chair!

1219
01:03:06,043 --> 01:03:07,348
One, two, three!

1220
01:03:10,264 --> 01:03:12,310
Look out. Here comes Mom!

1221
01:03:12,484 --> 01:03:15,052
Up in the air, Francine.

1222
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:17,706
Bend your knees, boys.
Here comes Papa Charlie!

1223
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:22,363
Mazel tov!

1224
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,716
Come on. Sit down.

1225
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:32,765
This is amazing!

1226
01:03:32,939 --> 01:03:34,941
That's it, God. I'm converting!

1227
01:03:47,171 --> 01:03:48,781
Hi.

1228
01:03:48,955 --> 01:03:50,478
I'm Francine.
I'm Lindsay's mom.

1229
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:52,437
Mm. She is so special.

1230
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:54,047
Oh.You must be so proud.

1231
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,397
Yeah. I'm Emma, by the way.

1232
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,182
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

1233
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:02,186
Yes, nice to meet you. These
spare ribs are delicious!

1234
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,883
Oh, good.
Mm-hm.

1235
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:06,103
So how long
have you been dating my father?

1236
01:04:06,277 --> 01:04:10,107
What? No, no, no.
We're just friends.

1237
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:13,066
I'm sure.No. He's just really nice to me.

1238
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,068
Mm-hm. And I just love his writing.

1239
01:04:15,242 --> 01:04:17,157
Oh.

1240
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:19,377
Okay. So, um...

1241
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:22,206
So, what do you do, Emma?
For a living, I mean.

1242
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,556
I'm a singer.Wow.

1243
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,688
Anything I might
be familiar with?

1244
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,125
No.

1245
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:30,605
But we got
a whole bunch of videos

1246
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:33,652
that are blowing up
on Instagram right now.

1247
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:36,220
Cool. You should come check us out.

1248
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:39,136
We perform all over the city. Where?

1249
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:42,922
Uh... Mostly underground. Like clubs?

1250
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:45,664
Sometimes,
but more so subway stations.

1251
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,798
Like, uh, Columbus Circle,
Union Square, Penn Station.

1252
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,366
You gotta check us out.
You know what?

1253
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,543
I'm gonna get me some more ribs
because I love meat.

1254
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:57,806
Anything I could pet, I eat.

1255
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:13,953
Lindsay...

1256
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:16,260
I have to tell you
how proud I am of you

1257
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:18,784
that you wanted to have
this bat mitzvah.

1258
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,699
And I wanna give you something.

1259
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:27,619
This...

1260
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:29,751
This was your Grandma Carrie's.

1261
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:33,059
And now it's yours.

1262
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:36,758
Put your hair back.

1263
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,065
See if I can...

1264
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,198
Good. Oh, it looks perfect.

1265
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:43,940
It's really pretty.Yeah.

1266
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:46,072
I'm giving you this...

1267
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:49,206
because today
is the first big step...

1268
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:50,859
with so many more to come.

1269
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:53,645
And I'll be there for you

1270
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:54,820
for all of that.

1271
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:59,303
And I can't wait
to see who you're gonna become.

1272
01:06:01,435 --> 01:06:02,697
I love you.

1273
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:05,309
I love you too.

1274
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:08,181
Thank you, Papa.

1275
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:14,753
Hey, Dad, by the way...

1276
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:17,451
I got that job
I was telling you about.

1277
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,670
What job?

1278
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:22,021
The building in Union Square.

1279
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:24,284
Yeah. Anyway,
they love my design.

1280
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,983
Great. Isn't that great?

1281
01:06:27,157 --> 01:06:29,855
Good going, kid. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

1282
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:35,426
That's great, huh?
You know, Rex is an architect.

1283
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,298
I know. Anyone who's born in
a museum is bound to be smart.

1284
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:40,257
He told you about that?

1285
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,128
Yeah, he's very proud of you.

1286
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:47,394
This is her first bat mitzvah.
What do you think so far?

1287
01:06:47,568 --> 01:06:49,744
It's okay so far. Just okay?

1288
01:06:49,918 --> 01:06:51,616
In the beginning,
it was really hot

1289
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,184
with all the dancing
and the chairs up, but...

1290
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:56,142
Ahem, all due respect
to your tribe,

1291
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:57,883
but it's a little dull now.

1292
01:06:58,057 --> 01:07:00,364
Well, the reading.
It'll pick up again.

1293
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:02,670
Well, why don't we do
something to help a little?

1294
01:07:02,844 --> 01:07:04,803
Where you going?

1295
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:06,500
Dad. Dad!

1296
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,503
Hey, hey, hey.

1297
01:07:09,677 --> 01:07:11,897
Do you have
the instrumental for...?

1298
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:18,251
Good evening, everybody.

1299
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:20,210
Um, my name is Emma Payge.

1300
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:23,909
I'm a very good friend
of Papa Charlie's. And, Lindsay,

1301
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,607
could you please come on down
to the dance floor?

1302
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:27,869
Uh...

1303
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,436
This is my first time

1304
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:31,830
ever coming to a bat mitzvah.

1305
01:07:32,004 --> 01:07:34,920
And I have to say,
so far, I feel so welcome.

1306
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,661
I'm having such a good time.

1307
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:39,272
DJ, hit that beat.

1308
01:07:39,446 --> 01:07:41,318
And this one's for you, Lindsay.

1309
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,842
If you know the words
to the song, sing along.

1310
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:47,106

Mazel tov.

1363
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:46,981
You rocked that shul.

1364
01:10:47,155 --> 01:10:48,983
I mean, it was like
Shabbos Night Live.

1365
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:52,465
You made the whole party.

1366
01:10:52,639 --> 01:10:54,902
I think I had more fun
than your family did.

1367
01:10:55,076 --> 01:10:56,991
Why are they looking
at me like that?

1368
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:59,342
Do they not know
what's going on here?

1369
01:10:59,516 --> 01:11:01,518
Actually, they don't.
Emma, listen.

1370
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:03,041
You don't know everything.

1371
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:04,912
I mean, there's
a lot of hard feelings.

1372
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:06,349
About what?

1373
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:08,829
Well, they both...

1374
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:10,396
Well, Francine especially.

1375
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,007
I wasn't around enough
when they were kids.

1376
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:14,531
Which was probably true,

1377
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:17,142
but I was working,
like, all the time.

1378
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:20,972
Then after Carrie died, there
was a revolving door of nannies.

1379
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:23,931
And when I was there...

1380
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:27,587
I just had a lot of trouble
giving them what they needed.

1381
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,589
I mean, I just was so sad.

1382
01:11:29,763 --> 01:11:31,809
And what do they have
against me?

1383
01:11:31,983 --> 01:11:34,986
Well, after she passed away...

1384
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,076
I didn't wanna get involved with
anybody. You know, I couldn't.

1385
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,122
So I dated
a lot of younger women.

1386
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,037
So they probably looked at us

1387
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:45,170
thinking there's something else
going on here.

1388
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:47,041
I'm really sorry they upset you.

1389
01:11:49,174 --> 01:11:51,437
Ladies and gentlemen,
Itzhak Perlman.

1390
01:11:51,611 --> 01:11:53,178
That's him.

1391
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:55,441
Does he take requests?
Itzhak Perlman is a genius.

1392
01:11:55,615 --> 01:11:57,791
He doesn't take requests.
You still owe me a dance.

1393
01:11:57,965 --> 01:11:59,445
I danced with you.
I danced the horah.

1394
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:00,577
The horahdoesn't count.

1395
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:01,969
The horah'sa dance.

1396
01:12:02,143 --> 01:12:03,580
You run around,
they lift you up,

1397
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:05,034
and you sweat into your clothes.

1398
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:06,931
That's a dance.Mm-mm. Doesn't count.

1399
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:08,541
Come on, Charlie. We're dancing.

1400
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:10,369
Come on. We're gonna go dance.

1401
01:12:14,895 --> 01:12:17,637
Who dances to a violin concerto? We do.

1402
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:20,336
Okay.

1403
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:38,397
What? Oh, there we go.

1404
01:12:38,571 --> 01:12:40,573
Look out. Look out.

1405
01:12:40,747 --> 01:12:41,879
Whoo!

1406
01:13:58,521 --> 01:13:59,696
Whoa!

1407
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,132
Where have you been?

1408
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:03,395
When? The last eight hours or so.

1409
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:04,875
Here. And just so I know,

1410
01:14:05,049 --> 01:14:06,311
where have I been? Here.

1411
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:07,660
With you?
Yeah.

1412
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:09,357
Oh, that's what I was afraid of.

1413
01:14:09,532 --> 01:14:11,577
Really? I thought
it was kind of nice.

1414
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:14,754
Emma, I didn't want
for this to happen.

1415
01:14:14,928 --> 01:14:17,104
I don't know what you mean
when you say "this."

1416
01:14:17,278 --> 01:14:21,152
But if the "this" you're
referring to is that "this,"

1417
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:22,806
it didn't happen.

1418
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,938
I got afraid of
the thunder and lightning,

1419
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:26,984
and I snuck in here
and spooned you.

1420
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:28,507
That's it. We just spooned.

1421
01:14:28,681 --> 01:14:30,117
That's it?

1422
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,163
That's it.
Okay.

1423
01:14:32,337 --> 01:14:34,687
Look, you're
an attractive older man,

1424
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:36,863
but your little, frail body
would not be able

1425
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:38,430
to handle all these groceries.

1426
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:41,389
I'll break your back.
It's too heavy for you.

1427
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:44,044
Can't ride this ride.
The ride is too bumpy.

1428
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:47,874
You might dislocate
your shoulder, then you'd die.

1429
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:50,268
Can't have that.

1430
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:54,054
Anyways, thank you
for letting me sleep here.

1431
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:56,013
Mwah! You're sweet, Charlie.

1432
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:58,711
You might want to think about
getting some bigger boxers.

1433
01:14:58,885 --> 01:15:01,018
I'm not sure
they can handle your groceries.

1434
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:03,324
They's just too little.

1435
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:07,633
Three, two, one, now!

1436
01:15:07,807 --> 01:15:09,417
I first became incredibly single

1437
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:11,202
when the fetus
of my twin brother

1438
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:14,031
left the womb a month
ahead of me, because...

1439
01:15:14,205 --> 01:15:15,598
Well, he said he'd had enough.

1440
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,340
This continued
when I was an infant,

1441
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,778
when my mom refused
to breastfeed me.

1442
01:15:21,952 --> 01:15:25,303
She said, "Let's take things
slow and see where this goes."

1443
01:15:26,957 --> 01:15:29,002
And now I live
in this studio apartment,

1444
01:15:29,176 --> 01:15:30,743
where I lie awake at night

1445
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:34,791
and fantasize about having sex
with another person.

1446
01:15:34,965 --> 01:15:37,750
Which would be fun...
so I've heard.

1447
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:41,145
And I think
I'd be a pretty good lover.

1448
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:45,453
Find those hard-to-find spots
that drive the women wild.

1449
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:48,326
Because I have Google Maps.

1450
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,633
"In two inches, make a left."

1451
01:15:57,378 --> 01:16:01,426
If you're also incredibly single
like me, why not give me a call?

1452
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,081
If not...

1453
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:06,083
Then the wrath of my god,

1454
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:10,304
the great god Zoomgali,
who is also incredibly single,

1455
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:11,915
will come and find you,

1456
01:16:12,089 --> 01:16:14,874
and the sounds
will color the sky,

1457
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:17,747
and he will come after you
and your loved ones,

1458
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:20,793
and damn you
to the fires of hell!

1459
01:16:23,143 --> 01:16:24,536
So call me.

1460
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:28,888
You're killing me.

1461
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:33,589
Clear. Commercial. Two minutes.

1462
01:16:33,763 --> 01:16:36,069
That was you. That's you, dude.

1463
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:38,202
Killed it! Thanks.

1464
01:16:38,376 --> 01:16:39,638
Oh, God.

1465
01:16:39,812 --> 01:16:41,509
I thought
my phone was off. Sorry.

1466
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:44,512
Hello. Yeah. I'm still
at the show. I can't talk.

1467
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:46,689
I found it. What did you find?

1468
01:16:46,863 --> 01:16:49,126
That great painting
of that old house

1469
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,737
that was hanging in
the empty space on your wall.

1470
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:54,261
Oh, it's beautiful. I rehung it.

1471
01:16:54,435 --> 01:16:56,394
You're still at my house?

1472
01:16:56,568 --> 01:16:58,701
Yeah. But I'm about
to go back to my place.

1473
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:00,572
Take it down. What?

1474
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:02,106
Take it down.
I don't wanna see it.

1475
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:04,054
I'm sorry.
I thought you misplaced it.

1476
01:17:04,228 --> 01:17:05,969
Emma, I don't wanna see it,
understand?

1477
01:17:06,143 --> 01:17:07,361
I just don't wanna see it.

1478
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:09,233
Get rid of it! Fine.

1479
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:15,239
New girlfriend? Huh. I don't even know.

1480
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:17,720
Hey, you were right.

1481
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:19,852
He's gonna be good.Yeah.

1482
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:23,639
Three, two, one, now!

1483
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:25,858
In the world of music,
Lady Gaga announced

1484
01:17:26,032 --> 01:17:29,166
she is changing
her name to "Lady Gagaga."

1485
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,255
She gave no explanation
for her decision.

1486
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:33,431
According to a poll,
Americans are concerned

1487
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:34,954
about a new axis of evil

1488
01:17:35,128 --> 01:17:36,869
that threatens
our country's democracy.

1489
01:17:37,043 --> 01:17:38,697
North Korea, ISIS

1490
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:41,308
and Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell.

1491
01:17:45,182 --> 01:17:48,751
Uh... Moving on. No, no, no.

1492
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:51,057
Is anyone bothered
by this but me?

1493
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,190
Do you hear that it's wrong?

1494
01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:55,627
Your emphasis...
You're an emphasis moron.

1495
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:59,109
What the hell is he doing?

1496
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:00,893
Everything you say is off.

1497
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:04,201
It's not "wi fi," it's Wi-Fi.

1498
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:08,553
It's not "polar ice caps,"
it's polar icecaps.

1499
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,729
You are a comedy kamikaze.

1500
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:14,167
Oh, wait. A "comma-kaze." What the hell?

1501
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:18,128
Anybody with a correct amount
of chromosomes...

1502
01:18:18,302 --> 01:18:20,217
would know that
it's Mitch McConnell,

1503
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:21,958
not "Mitch-McConnell."

1504
01:18:22,132 --> 01:18:24,351
You make it sound like
there a lot of McConnells!

1505
01:18:24,525 --> 01:18:26,658
There's only one.
There's no Stewie McConnell.

1506
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:29,400
Is there a Stewie McConnell
in the house? No!

1507
01:18:29,574 --> 01:18:31,794
What the hell is going on?
Should we cut to commercial?

1508
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:34,927
Go to commercial? This is live.
Just stay on it.

1509
01:18:35,101 --> 01:18:36,712
Jesus Christ. No, I'm sorry.

1510
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:38,626
"Jesus, Christ."

1511
01:18:38,801 --> 01:18:41,760
Who, of course,
was born in "Bethle-hem."

1512
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:44,676
I even put it on the cue card,
because I had...

1513
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,461
Know what this is? I have no idea. No.

1514
01:18:47,635 --> 01:18:49,202
Thank you, Al. Look at this.

1515
01:18:49,376 --> 01:18:52,423
I had it written the exact
same size so you would know.

1516
01:18:52,597 --> 01:18:55,252
"Mitch McConnell,"
not "Mitch-McConnell."

1517
01:18:55,426 --> 01:18:56,906
Mitch McConnell,
you see that? Al.

1518
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,343
Camera one, spin around.
Give me Al's reaction.

1519
01:18:59,517 --> 01:19:01,911
Yeah. Tell everybody. Did I
tell you that this would happen?

1520
01:19:02,085 --> 01:19:06,263
He told me this would happen.Everybody.
Exhibit A, Al!

1521
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:07,830
Thank you, Al, you sweet...

1522
01:19:08,004 --> 01:19:10,441
Where is he going?
Get him. Follow him.

1523
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,095
You.

1524
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:14,575
Look. Look, ma'am,
what does that say?

1525
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,360
"Mitch McConnell." Thank you very much.

1526
01:19:16,534 --> 01:19:18,492
You, you. Stand up.
What does this say?

1527
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,930
"Mitch McConnell." Again. I can't hear you.

1528
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:22,845
"Mitch McConnell." We got a winner.

1529
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,934
Dang it.

1530
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:27,632
Take anything off the top shelf,
goddamn it.

1531
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:30,113
Everybody, tell me.
What does this say?

1532
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:31,810
"Mitch McConnell." Can't hear you.

1533
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:33,377
"Mitch McConnell." One more time.

1534
01:19:33,551 --> 01:19:34,900
"Mitch McConnell." Thank you.

1535
01:19:35,074 --> 01:19:36,815
Roger, you're
a very talented young guy.

1536
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:38,338
But I have to tell you,

1537
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:40,427
I am sick and tired
of writing jokes for you

1538
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:42,473
and having you abuse them,
you dumb turd.

1539
01:19:42,647 --> 01:19:43,691
Oh, boy.

1540
01:19:43,866 --> 01:19:47,086
Dumb turd! Everybody. Dumb turd!

1541
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,915
Dumb turd!
Dumb turd! Dumb turd!

1542
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:51,961
Stand up. Dumb turd!

1543
01:19:52,135 --> 01:19:53,135
Dumb turd!

1544
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,095
Dumb turd! Dumb turd!

1545
01:19:56,269 --> 01:19:59,098
Mom, Dad, come here.
Papa Charlie is on television.

1546
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:00,926
Dumb turd! Dumb turd!

1547
01:20:03,146 --> 01:20:05,626
I say dumb, you say turd!
Dumb...

1548
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:06,801
Turd.Dumb...

1549
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:07,846
Oh, my God.

1550
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,195
You say dumb, I say turd.

1551
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:11,241
Dumb... I need wide, wide, wide.

1552
01:20:11,415 --> 01:20:12,415
Dumb... Turd!

1553
01:20:12,503 --> 01:20:13,330
Dumb... Turd!

1554
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:16,028
Dumb turd! Dumb turd!

1555
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:18,509
Turd! Turd! That's it, I'm done.

1556
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:20,728
Thank you.

1557
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:31,000
Would you get those
damn birds out of your hair?

1558
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:32,305
Larry!

1559
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:41,793
Camera one. Back to Roger
and reset. Take one!

1560
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:45,318
Thank you, "Charlie Burnz." No, no!
Charlie Burnz.

1561
01:20:45,492 --> 01:20:48,321
Sorry. I'll work on it.

1562
01:20:48,495 --> 01:20:51,150
That's the news of the night...
Of thenight.

1563
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:52,935
The newsof the...

1564
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:56,460
I guess I'm a dumb turd.

1565
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:57,722
Thank you...

1566
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,158
Good night.

1567
01:21:00,464 --> 01:21:02,248
And we're clear!

1568
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:03,422
What was that?

1569
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:04,685
What the hell was that?

1570
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,428
What the hell was that?

1571
01:21:08,602 --> 01:21:10,474
Charlie, what was that?
That was hilarious.

1572
01:21:10,648 --> 01:21:12,041
The schmuck
can't get a name right.

1573
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:14,043
Really inspired idea, Charlie.

1574
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:17,263
Oh, my God, Charlie.
Thatis live television.

1575
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:19,613
Charlie, why didn't you tell me?

1576
01:21:19,787 --> 01:21:23,748
I haven't told my kids yet.
I bet they know now. We're live.

1577
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,098
My fault. I should not
have gone back in there.

1578
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:28,666
I'm so stupid. I'm just
so stupid. It's my fault!

1579
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,408
Stupid? What are you talking
about? Everyone loved it.

1580
01:21:31,582 --> 01:21:34,324
When did you think of this?
Comes to me all the time.

1581
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:36,239
Every second, it doesn't stop.

1582
01:21:36,413 --> 01:21:38,632
That's why it was so good.
It was so real.

1583
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:40,808
Holy shit, you guys.
Twitter is blowing up.

1584
01:21:40,983 --> 01:21:43,289
They love you, Charlie.
They love the grumpy writer

1585
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:45,161
who can't bear
to see his words mangled.

1586
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:47,859
They think you're funny, man. Funny? Funny?

1587
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:49,643
Saying I'll be back
in a few minutes

1588
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:52,516
and never seeing
that person again is funny?

1589
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:54,387
Charlie, what...? It's not funny!

1590
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:56,999
- How can that be funny?
- Are you Charlie Burnz?

1591
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:02,091
Charlie Burnz.

1592
01:22:02,265 --> 01:22:03,570
Mr. Burnz?

1593
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:06,530
I'm Charlie Burnz.

1594
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:11,970
Don't tell me
that something's wrong.

1595
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:14,712
Charlie?

1596
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:17,193
Charlie?

1597
01:22:20,152 --> 01:22:23,329
Nothing's wrong. It's okay.
You're all right, Charlie.

1598
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:27,159
Hey, come back to my office.

1599
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:30,293
Lie down for a little bit. Yeah?

1600
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:31,859
I'm so tired.

1601
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:34,427
It's okay. It's okay.

1602
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:36,647
Come on. I'm really tired.

1603
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,518
It's all right. It's all right.

1604
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,175
Until tonight, he's been fine. EMMA: Yeah.

1605
01:22:43,349 --> 01:22:44,611
Sometimes he's just great.

1606
01:22:44,785 --> 01:22:47,484
You'd never know
he had a problem.

1607
01:22:47,658 --> 01:22:50,661
And then it'll just hit him,
but nothing like this.

1608
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:52,750
I had no idea.

1609
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:54,882
It's our secret. Our?

1610
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:58,060
Nobody else knows? No.

1611
01:22:58,234 --> 01:22:59,583
Well, we have a problem.

1612
01:22:59,757 --> 01:23:01,585
Social media has blown up.
They love it.

1613
01:23:01,759 --> 01:23:03,674
Everybody is asking,
"Who is this guy?"

1614
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:05,241
They want him back next week.

1615
01:23:05,415 --> 01:23:06,807
I know it's gone viral.Yeah.

1616
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,810
You know, I'm very nervous
about what people...

1617
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,899
We need to post
something right away.

1618
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:13,379
Twitter, Instagram.

1619
01:23:13,553 --> 01:23:15,207
Sorry to interrupt.
I just overheard.

1620
01:23:15,381 --> 01:23:18,123
Darrell, come on. Let me do it, please.

1621
01:23:18,297 --> 01:23:19,995
I know what to say.

1622
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:23,563
Okay. Good.

1623
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:26,610
I have to run it by the network.Okay.

1624
01:23:26,784 --> 01:23:29,743
Uh, this is
Charlie's friend Emma.

1625
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:31,919
This is Darrell,
he works with Charlie.

1626
01:23:32,094 --> 01:23:34,400
Hi.Nice to meet you.

1627
01:23:34,574 --> 01:23:35,880
I'll get started.

1628
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:39,318
What a night.

1629
01:23:40,885 --> 01:23:42,321
Okay, Charlie. There's the car.

1630
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:44,323
Go ahead and get in.Okay.

1631
01:23:44,497 --> 01:23:47,065
Yeah? Yeah, I got it.

1632
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:48,936
Thanks. Hey, Charlie.

1633
01:23:49,111 --> 01:23:51,156
Yeah? I just wanted to say good night

1634
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,202
and make sure you're okay.

1635
01:23:53,376 --> 01:23:54,768
Thank you.
Yeah.

1636
01:23:54,942 --> 01:23:56,335
Hey, I, um...

1637
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:58,511
I posted that:

1638
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:01,471
"Tonight, Charlie Burnz
showed why he's a comedy legend

1639
01:24:01,645 --> 01:24:04,343
when he gave a hilarious
one-time-only performance

1640
01:24:04,517 --> 01:24:06,084
as a disgruntled writer.

1641
01:24:06,258 --> 01:24:07,738
Thank YOU, Charlie.

1642
01:24:07,912 --> 01:24:09,783
The crew and cast
of This Just In.

1643
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:11,655
Hashtag 'dumb turd.'"

1644
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:14,571
And I put the "you" in all caps

1645
01:24:14,745 --> 01:24:16,747
so it was the wrong inflection.

1646
01:24:16,921 --> 01:24:18,357
Thanks, kid.

1647
01:24:18,531 --> 01:24:19,793
Good night, Charlie.

1648
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:22,448
You know, Darrell here

1649
01:24:22,622 --> 01:24:24,494
is gonna be
a terrific writer someday.

1650
01:24:25,973 --> 01:24:27,062
I don't know.

1651
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:28,498
I do.

1652
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,588
I'll see you, kid.

1653
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,028
This is a scan of
your brain in February.

1654
01:24:37,202 --> 01:24:39,291
And this is the one
we just took.

1655
01:24:44,122 --> 01:24:46,472
They look the same to me.

1656
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:49,388
Yes, but your symptoms
are changing.

1657
01:24:51,434 --> 01:24:53,479
If I'm right, you may have
a form of dementia

1658
01:24:53,653 --> 01:24:55,742
called
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.

1659
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:01,052
What do you mean,
ifyou're right?

1660
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:10,714
Only way to get a definitive
diagnosis of CJD is...

1661
01:25:10,888 --> 01:25:13,195
a post-mortem autopsy.

1662
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:14,500
Well...

1663
01:25:16,023 --> 01:25:17,373
why don't we do that now?

1664
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:20,289
I mean, I have a lunch,
but I could cancel that.

1665
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:23,683
What happens next?

1666
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:27,209
There are other medications
than the ones you're on now...

1667
01:25:27,383 --> 01:25:30,342
that could slow this down a bit,

1668
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:32,431
but before too long...

1669
01:25:32,605 --> 01:25:34,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1670
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,483
"Before too long" is how long?

1671
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:43,529
A year, maybe.

1672
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:50,884
You probably wanna start
thinking about a caregiver.

1673
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:54,584
A nurse?

1674
01:25:54,758 --> 01:25:57,413
Yes, or your family.

1675
01:25:57,587 --> 01:26:00,111
Your son and daughter.Well...

1676
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,418
that's not happening.

1677
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:06,378
In times like this, you should
be surrounded by loved ones,

1678
01:26:06,552 --> 01:26:09,816
or professionals who are
trained to care for you.

1679
01:26:15,082 --> 01:26:17,955
Uh, I'll do it.
I'll take care of Charlie.

1680
01:26:18,129 --> 01:26:19,913
No, you can't.
You're going away.

1681
01:26:20,087 --> 01:26:21,480
My plans have changed.

1682
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:23,656
No. No, they haven't changed.

1683
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:26,137
She's in a band and they're
supposed to go on tour.

1684
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:28,357
Nah, I don't need to do that.No.
Yes, you do.

1685
01:26:28,531 --> 01:26:29,967
She does need to do that.

1686
01:26:31,621 --> 01:26:33,840
May I ask
what your relationship is?

1687
01:26:34,014 --> 01:26:35,277
I don't know. I don't know.

1688
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:37,409
How long have you
known each other?

1689
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:40,064
I'm guessing
about six months or so.

1690
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:41,805
Are you boyfriend
and girlfriend?

1691
01:26:44,155 --> 01:26:46,636
Are we?

1692
01:26:46,810 --> 01:26:49,160
How would you define
boyfriend and girlfriend?

1693
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:51,945
Well, are you
having sexual relations?

1694
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:53,817
We spooned.

1695
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:58,125
Charlie...

1696
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,476
what about your kids?

1697
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,739
I honestly don't know
if they've ever spooned.

1698
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,697
Charlie.

1699
01:27:04,871 --> 01:27:08,397
This is no time for jokes. Yes, it is.

1700
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:10,747
It's the perfect time for jokes,
goddamn it.

1701
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:12,749
Don't try to take away
my sense of humor.

1702
01:27:12,923 --> 01:27:14,490
I'd rather die right now.

1703
01:27:16,274 --> 01:27:18,798
Boy, this God... This God is
a real jokester, isn't he?

1704
01:27:18,972 --> 01:27:20,496
What a really funny God.

1705
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:21,845
"Hey, live your whole life

1706
01:27:22,019 --> 01:27:23,499
and you won't
remember any of it."

1707
01:27:25,022 --> 01:27:26,022
Fuck you!

1708
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:29,026
Damn it.
It's gonna be okay.

1709
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,158
How can this be okay?

1710
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,073
How can this be okay?

1711
01:27:37,774 --> 01:27:39,602
My kids don't know anything.

1712
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,259
I'll tell them
at the right time.

1713
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:45,999
Charlie.

1714
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,568
This is the right time.

1715
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,269
You can't be alone anymore.

1716
01:27:59,883 --> 01:28:01,624
I'll take care of him
till I can't.

1717
01:28:05,236 --> 01:28:07,194
I'll write you
some prescriptions.

1718
01:28:08,892 --> 01:28:11,068
I'll let the two of you
be alone a bit.

1719
01:28:21,818 --> 01:28:23,559
What the hell is wrong with you? What?

1720
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:25,693
There's nothing wrong with me.
You're not staying.

1721
01:28:25,778 --> 01:28:27,127
Yes, I am. No, you're not.

1722
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:30,217
You heard what the doc said.
It's over, okay?

1723
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:32,132
That's it.
Please, leave me alone!

1724
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:36,093
Charlie. Don't "Charlie" me!

1725
01:28:36,267 --> 01:28:39,096
You have a life!
You have your music, so run.

1726
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:41,359
Run for the hills, kid.
It's over.

1727
01:28:41,533 --> 01:28:45,798
I'm telling you, it's over.
Please, I just wanna be alone!

1728
01:28:45,972 --> 01:28:49,280
I'm not going anywhere.
I don't want you to stay!

1729
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:53,676
You hear me?
What are you staying for?

1730
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:57,070
What's here?
What's gonna be left? Nothing!

1731
01:28:57,244 --> 01:28:58,942
That's not true, Charlie.

1732
01:29:00,944 --> 01:29:02,859
I'm lost. I'm...

1733
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:06,863
Help, help, help. I'm lost.

1734
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:10,475
I'm so... I'm so lost.

1735
01:29:11,824 --> 01:29:13,870
I'm sorry, pal. But I'm in.

1736
01:29:15,045 --> 01:29:16,699
You wanna be with a stranger?

1737
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:22,095
Pretty soon everyone's
gonna be a stranger.

1738
01:29:22,269 --> 01:29:24,141
Not me.

1739
01:29:24,315 --> 01:29:25,838
I'm not gonna leave you.

1740
01:29:28,537 --> 01:29:29,625
Thank you.

1741
01:29:48,905 --> 01:29:50,515
Mm.

1742
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:51,689
Hi.

1743
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:54,432
Whose room did this used to be?

1744
01:29:54,606 --> 01:29:55,868
Francine's.

1745
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:58,044
That explains the chill.

1746
01:29:58,218 --> 01:29:59,306
Something wrong?

1747
01:29:59,481 --> 01:30:00,569
I can't sleep.

1748
01:30:00,743 --> 01:30:02,571
What's up?

1749
01:30:02,745 --> 01:30:05,312
I wrote something. That's good.

1750
01:30:05,487 --> 01:30:07,532
I wanna read it to you.
Okay.

1751
01:30:07,706 --> 01:30:09,229
This is my journal.

1752
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,928
I've been writing stuff
for the book in it

1753
01:30:12,102 --> 01:30:14,060
because typing
has become a problem for me.

1754
01:30:14,234 --> 01:30:15,540
I know.

1755
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:21,503
The book is called For Carrie.
This is the dedication.

1756
01:30:21,677 --> 01:30:24,462
A writer always dedicates
the book to somebody he loves...

1757
01:30:24,636 --> 01:30:26,246
I know what it means.Okay.

1758
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:30,816
"To Emma Payge.

1759
01:30:32,296 --> 01:30:33,819
Thank you for taking my truth

1760
01:30:33,993 --> 01:30:36,735
and making it more interesting.

1761
01:30:36,909 --> 01:30:40,043
I kind of love you. CB."

1762
01:30:40,217 --> 01:30:42,262
I kind of love you too, old man.

1763
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,961
Oh. Really?

1764
01:30:45,135 --> 01:30:46,789
Yeah. Big-time.

1765
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:49,705
Didn't see that coming.

1766
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,838
You make me smile.

1767
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,798
Good night.

1768
01:30:55,972 --> 01:30:57,234
Good night.

1769
01:31:04,241 --> 01:31:05,329
Hey, Emma.

1770
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:10,682
I'm grateful to you
that you're here.

1771
01:31:10,856 --> 01:31:13,337
I wanna have fun. I wanna laugh.

1772
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:16,296
I want to not be scared.
And I wanna write the book,

1773
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,342
and I wanna
do all of that with you.

1774
01:31:18,516 --> 01:31:21,127
But you have
to promise me something.

1775
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:22,738
When it's time...

1776
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:25,871
you go back out and sing.

1777
01:31:26,045 --> 01:31:28,178
You're an artist,
and that's what you should do.

1778
01:31:28,352 --> 01:31:29,571
Please, promise me.

1779
01:31:30,963 --> 01:31:32,138
I promise.

1780
01:31:32,312 --> 01:31:33,488
Good.

1781
01:31:35,185 --> 01:31:37,143
I'm a bargain for 22 bucks,
don't you think?

1782
01:31:37,317 --> 01:31:39,232
Heh. Hell, yeah.

1783
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:43,062
Good night. Good night.

1784
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:10,655
Oh.

1785
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:12,091
I must've dozed off.

1786
01:32:12,265 --> 01:32:14,224
These new meds are
making me very sleepy.

1787
01:32:14,398 --> 01:32:17,009
I haven't taken a nap
since the Carter administration.

1788
01:32:19,098 --> 01:32:21,057
What do you have there? Nothing.

1789
01:32:21,231 --> 01:32:22,885
Let me see.

1790
01:32:24,408 --> 01:32:25,844
It...

1791
01:32:26,018 --> 01:32:29,152
It's that... Emma, I know what it is.

1792
01:32:30,457 --> 01:32:31,850
I know you said get rid of it,

1793
01:32:32,024 --> 01:32:34,113
but it's just so beautiful.

1794
01:32:34,287 --> 01:32:35,550
Give it to me.

1795
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:50,434
Carrie painted this. Yeah.

1796
01:32:50,608 --> 01:32:53,263
See, she put her name
in the bushes.

1797
01:32:53,437 --> 01:32:55,744
See there? In the trees.Mm-hm.

1798
01:32:58,964 --> 01:33:00,531
This is Lake Charlie.

1799
01:33:00,705 --> 01:33:02,664
Lake Charlie. Where's that?

1800
01:33:02,838 --> 01:33:06,493
That's about two hours
north of the city. Yeah.

1801
01:33:08,234 --> 01:33:10,280
Carrie gave me a lake
for my birthday.

1802
01:33:10,454 --> 01:33:11,498
A lake?

1803
01:33:11,673 --> 01:33:14,240
Yeah. It was actually a pond.

1804
01:33:14,414 --> 01:33:18,201
But Pond Charlie didn't sound
as good as Lake Charlie, heh.

1805
01:33:18,375 --> 01:33:20,246
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What?

1806
01:33:22,118 --> 01:33:25,121
Tell me all about Lake Charlie.

1807
01:33:26,513 --> 01:33:27,558
Okay.

1808
01:33:29,429 --> 01:33:30,909
It was my 40th birthday.

1809
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:33,303
Happy birthday, Charlie Burnz.

1810
01:33:33,477 --> 01:33:35,522
Happy birthday. WOMAN:
Happy birthday, Charlie.

1811
01:33:35,697 --> 01:33:38,438
We had a party
outside in the garden.

1812
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:40,789
And after everybody was gone...

1813
01:33:40,963 --> 01:33:43,574
Carrie shows me this photograph
of this woodsy area

1814
01:33:43,748 --> 01:33:45,184
with this beautiful lake on it.

1815
01:33:45,358 --> 01:33:48,840
Happy birthday, Charlie Burnz.
This is for you.

1816
01:33:49,014 --> 01:33:52,191
For me? What is this?
What am I looking at?

1817
01:33:52,365 --> 01:33:55,673
It's called Lake Charlie. Lake Charlie?

1818
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:58,197
She was always trying
to get me to stop working.

1819
01:33:58,371 --> 01:34:02,027
And just be alone
with her and do nothing.

1820
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:04,334
And honestly the thought
of doing nothing

1821
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:06,162
terrified me, you know?

1822
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:10,514
But I loved it so much
and it meant so much to her

1823
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:15,214
that we'd go up there, you know,
and camp out, like, in a tent.

1824
01:34:15,388 --> 01:34:16,868
Can you imagine me in a tent?

1825
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:19,131
I mean, to me,
the great outdoors

1826
01:34:19,305 --> 01:34:21,438
would be a lot better
if it was indoors.

1827
01:34:21,612 --> 01:34:23,222
Good morning!

1828
01:34:27,618 --> 01:34:30,752
That smells good.
Smells better than me.

1829
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:34,320
Mm.

1830
01:34:34,494 --> 01:34:36,279
Wow... Whoa! Look what you did.

1831
01:34:40,979 --> 01:34:42,851
Hey, Charlie? Yeah?

1832
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:45,462
You know what I think? What?

1833
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:48,726
I think we need a house. A house?

1834
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:52,295
Yeah.
The kids will love it up here.

1835
01:34:52,469 --> 01:34:55,733
What? Kids? Didn't I tell you?

1836
01:34:57,604 --> 01:35:01,130
And that's how she told me
she was pregnant with Rex.

1837
01:35:01,304 --> 01:35:03,698
So she went looking for a house.

1838
01:35:03,872 --> 01:35:05,874
Wait, didn't you guys
build a house?

1839
01:35:06,048 --> 01:35:07,789
Oh, no, that's
way too easy for Carrie.

1840
01:35:07,963 --> 01:35:10,400
She scoured the countryside,
found this little house,

1841
01:35:10,574 --> 01:35:12,794
she bought it, lifted it up,

1842
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:15,753
put it on a flatbed truck and
she drove it to Lake Charlie.

1843
01:35:15,927 --> 01:35:18,190
Got a house, Charlie Burnz!

1844
01:35:20,627 --> 01:35:21,890
Thank you.

1845
01:35:22,064 --> 01:35:24,109
So we put in a new foundation,

1846
01:35:24,283 --> 01:35:26,633
plopped the house down on it,
renovated it,

1847
01:35:26,808 --> 01:35:28,723
painted it up,
made it a little bit bigger.

1848
01:35:28,897 --> 01:35:30,768
Mm-hm. It was our happy place.

1849
01:35:30,942 --> 01:35:34,032
Dad, come on! Let's go play.
Daddy, come on!

1850
01:35:34,206 --> 01:35:36,034
And she was right. Daddy, come on.

1851
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:37,383
Are you playing or not?

1852
01:35:37,557 --> 01:35:39,037
The kids loved it.

1853
01:35:39,211 --> 01:35:43,041
Aw. Now I know why you
didn't wanna hang the picture.

1854
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:46,218
No, you don't.

1855
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,919
I'm tired. I can't talk anymore.

1856
01:35:51,093 --> 01:35:55,053
Come on, Charlie. Please?
Don't take this with you.

1857
01:35:55,227 --> 01:35:57,055
I'm not going anywhere yet.

1858
01:36:00,929 --> 01:36:05,194
Okay. My first Broadway play,
It's My Time,

1859
01:36:05,368 --> 01:36:07,109
it opened
at the Belasco Theatre.

1860
01:36:07,283 --> 01:36:09,154
Reviews were terrific,
business was great,

1861
01:36:09,328 --> 01:36:10,895
but that wasn't enough for me.

1862
01:36:11,069 --> 01:36:12,984
The star was an actor
named Jerry Orbach,

1863
01:36:13,158 --> 01:36:15,595
and there was this one speech
late in the second act.

1864
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,859
It never landed right.
It drove me crazy.

1865
01:36:18,033 --> 01:36:21,036
All I wanted was one show
that was just perfect.

1866
01:36:26,563 --> 01:36:29,784
Things were tense...

1867
01:36:31,176 --> 01:36:33,439
between the two of us.

1868
01:36:33,613 --> 01:36:35,833
I'd been working so much.
What are we doing?

1869
01:36:36,007 --> 01:36:37,574
I'd been on the road
for four months

1870
01:36:37,748 --> 01:36:40,011
with the play
before it came to Broadway.

1871
01:36:40,185 --> 01:36:42,797
Everybody was looking forward
to spending some time together

1872
01:36:42,971 --> 01:36:45,190
at Lake Charlie,
and what was I doing?

1873
01:36:45,364 --> 01:36:47,932
I was rewriting a play
that was already a hit.

1874
01:36:48,106 --> 01:36:51,153
Charlie, we have to go
right now.

1875
01:36:51,327 --> 01:36:52,502
Traffic's gonna be awful.

1876
01:36:52,676 --> 01:36:53,956
I don't like driving
in the dark.

1877
01:36:54,069 --> 01:36:55,548
My mom's got the kids
there waiting.

1878
01:36:55,722 --> 01:36:57,002
We should have left an hour ago.

1879
01:36:57,159 --> 01:36:58,559
I had to rewrite
a speech for Jerry.

1880
01:36:58,682 --> 01:37:00,510
It wasn't landing right.Oh. Great. Okay.

1881
01:37:00,684 --> 01:37:02,207
That's just great. He's reading it.

1882
01:37:02,381 --> 01:37:03,948
I wanna make sure
it's okay with him.

1883
01:37:04,122 --> 01:37:06,168
Oh. You wanna make sure
it's okay with him?

1884
01:37:06,342 --> 01:37:08,039
With him? How about with me?

1885
01:37:08,213 --> 01:37:10,825
How about with the kids,
who you haven't seen for months?

1886
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:12,522
You promised me.
You promised us.

1887
01:37:12,696 --> 01:37:14,350
Stop yelling.
Five minutes, I promise.

1888
01:37:14,524 --> 01:37:17,005
I'll be right in and right out.
The kids are waiting.

1889
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:19,379
I understand. I'll be right out.
The people are in line,

1890
01:37:19,529 --> 01:37:21,209
the show goes up in an hour. Five minutes?

1891
01:37:21,313 --> 01:37:23,359
Yeah. Yeah.
I know you're upset,

1892
01:37:23,533 --> 01:37:25,013
but I hate
when you get like this.

1893
01:37:25,187 --> 01:37:26,971
If you're not back
in five minutes,

1894
01:37:27,145 --> 01:37:30,757
I'm leaving without you. I heard you, okay?
I heard you.

1895
01:37:30,932 --> 01:37:32,672
Goddamn it.

1896
01:37:36,589 --> 01:37:41,072
It took 15 minutes.
When I came out, she was gone.

1897
01:37:41,246 --> 01:37:43,596
I was angry.
So I watched the show,

1898
01:37:43,770 --> 01:37:46,469
that damn speech
still didn't land right.

1899
01:37:46,643 --> 01:37:47,923
I had a couple drinks with Jerry

1900
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:49,428
and then I came back here...

1901
01:37:51,256 --> 01:37:55,130
And the next thing I remember
is flashing lights.

1902
01:37:55,304 --> 01:37:56,958
And a policeman in the doorway

1903
01:37:57,132 --> 01:38:00,700
asking me my name
over and over again.

1904
01:38:02,702 --> 01:38:05,227
And I'm thinking
if I don't answer him,

1905
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:08,534
then maybe what he's about
to tell me didn't happen.

1906
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:18,414
He told me Carrie was driving

1907
01:38:18,588 --> 01:38:20,938
on this dark road
right near the house.

1908
01:38:21,112 --> 01:38:24,115
She came to this fork
in the road...

1909
01:38:24,289 --> 01:38:25,900
and some kid loaded on pills

1910
01:38:26,074 --> 01:38:28,032
driving a Jeep
ran the stop sign.

1911
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:32,341
And he hit her head-on.

1912
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,127
She died instantly.

1913
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:37,999
Kid walked away
without a scratch.

1914
01:38:40,044 --> 01:38:41,785
The last time I saw
that beautiful face,

1915
01:38:41,959 --> 01:38:42,959
she was mad at me.

1916
01:38:45,745 --> 01:38:49,271
That's why I can't look at
that picture anymore.

1917
01:38:49,445 --> 01:38:53,362
It makes me remember
the one thing I want to forget.

1918
01:39:00,804 --> 01:39:01,804
I'm sorry.

1919
01:39:07,028 --> 01:39:08,290
Me too.

1920
01:39:17,299 --> 01:39:20,258
Need anything from the store?
Um... Wonton soup.

1921
01:39:20,432 --> 01:39:22,792
I'd like to shampoo my hair.
It's getting a little greasy...

1922
01:39:22,869 --> 01:39:24,610
Charlie. What?

1923
01:39:26,786 --> 01:39:29,006
I'm just kidding. I'm okay.

1924
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:31,617
I promise. Thanks.Good.

1925
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:34,185
Hey, I was thinking, you know
what we could do someday?

1926
01:39:34,359 --> 01:39:35,795
It could be fun. Um...

1927
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,973
Ever been
to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum?

1928
01:39:39,147 --> 01:39:41,192
You ever been there?
It's a lot of fun.

1929
01:39:41,366 --> 01:39:43,760
It's pretty amazing
what they do.

1930
01:39:48,547 --> 01:39:51,028
Okay. Sure.

1931
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:14,617
You're back already?
Okay. Coming, coming, coming.

1932
01:40:18,142 --> 01:40:19,839
Hi! LINDSAY: Hi.

1933
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:23,060
Come on in. Come on in.
This is a surprise.

1934
01:40:23,234 --> 01:40:26,411
What's the matter? You look
very upset. What's wrong?

1935
01:40:26,585 --> 01:40:28,283
I had a fight with my mom.Oh.

1936
01:40:28,457 --> 01:40:30,067
She said you were
drunk and embarrassing.

1937
01:40:30,241 --> 01:40:32,722
I said you could never be.
You were funny on the show.

1938
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:35,296
Why does she keep you away from
me? She said something awful.

1939
01:40:35,464 --> 01:40:37,727
Does she know where you are?
She thinks I'm at school.

1940
01:40:37,901 --> 01:40:39,294
How did you get here? Uber.

1941
01:40:39,468 --> 01:40:41,252
We should tell her you're here. No!

1942
01:40:41,426 --> 01:40:43,385
She'll be so mad at me. But, Lindsay...

1943
01:40:43,559 --> 01:40:45,822
Please. I just have to know
if it's true.

1944
01:40:45,996 --> 01:40:47,432
Is what true?

1945
01:40:49,521 --> 01:40:52,959
She said it was because of you
that I don't have a grandma.

1946
01:40:53,134 --> 01:40:54,526
She said that to you?

1947
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:57,355
No. I overheard her
on the phone with Uncle Rex.

1948
01:40:59,705 --> 01:41:01,620
No, Lindsay, no.

1949
01:41:01,794 --> 01:41:03,666
Okay.

1950
01:41:07,235 --> 01:41:09,019
Lindsay never made it
to school, Rex.

1951
01:41:09,193 --> 01:41:12,066
She used my Uber account,
and guess where she took it to.

1952
01:41:13,502 --> 01:41:15,417
Charlie, I got your wonton soup,

1953
01:41:15,591 --> 01:41:19,464
but the chef said that you need
to use extra conditioner...

1954
01:41:19,638 --> 01:41:20,639
Charlie!

1955
01:41:22,467 --> 01:41:26,297
I got some short ribs.
They'll be so good.

1956
01:41:27,603 --> 01:41:28,691
Charlie?

1957
01:41:29,909 --> 01:41:32,564
Charlie? Charlie!

1958
01:41:34,566 --> 01:41:38,570
Where are you, old man?
Charlie, stop playing.

1959
01:41:38,744 --> 01:41:41,051
Hey. Where is she?

1960
01:41:41,225 --> 01:41:44,272
How'd you get in here? We grew up here.
Where is she?

1961
01:41:44,446 --> 01:41:45,621
Who?
My daughter Lindsay.

1962
01:41:45,795 --> 01:41:47,536
And our father. Where's our dad? Lindsay!

1963
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:49,451
Dad! Nobody's here.

1964
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:51,192
I just got home myself.

1965
01:41:51,366 --> 01:41:53,063
Home?
Do you live here?

1966
01:41:53,237 --> 01:41:56,066
I moved in a few days ago. Oh, lovely.

1967
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:59,156
Your dad needs me right now. I bet he does.

1968
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:02,072
You might want to rethink
your attitude, Francine.

1969
01:42:02,246 --> 01:42:04,640
What is this?
What is all this about?

1970
01:42:04,814 --> 01:42:07,164
That's research for a project
he's working on.

1971
01:42:07,338 --> 01:42:08,861
With our names
under the pictures?

1972
01:42:09,035 --> 01:42:11,168
He doesn't know who we are?
Not all the time.

1973
01:42:12,691 --> 01:42:14,780
Your father's sick.

1974
01:42:14,954 --> 01:42:17,609
He has a form of dementia.
And it's getting worse.

1975
01:42:19,176 --> 01:42:21,483
He can't be alone anymore.

1976
01:42:21,657 --> 01:42:24,094
That's why I moved in, Francine.

1977
01:42:24,268 --> 01:42:27,445
I'm his friend. He's writing
a book about your family

1978
01:42:27,619 --> 01:42:29,795
and I'm helping him finish it.

1979
01:42:29,969 --> 01:42:32,146
I can't believe this. We had no idea.

1980
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,105
That's because you're too busy
being pissed at him.

1981
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:38,456
Pretty soon, before you know it,
he's not gonna know who you are.

1982
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:40,545
But you'll remember him.

1983
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,852
He's done a very good job
of beating himself up

1984
01:42:43,026 --> 01:42:44,723
without you guys piling on.

1985
01:42:44,897 --> 01:42:46,638
You were very happy once.

1986
01:42:46,812 --> 01:42:49,337
It can happen again
if you let it.

1987
01:42:50,555 --> 01:42:51,555
How do we find them?

1988
01:42:51,687 --> 01:42:53,515
I put a GPS on his phone.

1989
01:42:53,689 --> 01:42:55,430
Okay. Let me see.

1990
01:42:59,347 --> 01:43:03,046
No. No, no, no. It's here. It's here.

1991
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,874
Where the hell are they? Damn.

1992
01:43:05,048 --> 01:43:07,833
Oh. If she's still using my
Uber account, we can find them.

1993
01:43:32,249 --> 01:43:33,609
I cannot believe this.

1994
01:43:33,685 --> 01:43:34,947
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong?

1995
01:43:35,121 --> 01:43:36,775
Longer trip than I thought.

1996
01:43:36,949 --> 01:43:39,343
You give five star.
I accept nothing less.

1997
01:43:39,517 --> 01:43:40,823
Is this the best way to go?

1998
01:43:42,738 --> 01:43:45,567
This is all my fault. She
overheard what I said to you.

1999
01:43:45,741 --> 01:43:47,612
We got in a fight... She heard that?

2000
01:43:47,786 --> 01:43:49,658
Yes. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

2001
01:43:49,832 --> 01:43:52,748
What if he does something crazy?
What's he gonna do, Francine?

2002
01:43:52,922 --> 01:43:54,184
What's gonna happen?

2003
01:43:54,358 --> 01:43:56,360
I don't know. He loves Lindsay.

2004
01:43:56,534 --> 01:43:57,970
Nothing will happen.

2005
01:43:58,144 --> 01:44:00,146
How can you be so sure?

2006
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:01,931
I know him.

2007
01:44:09,852 --> 01:44:13,421
Papa! Where are you going?
Come back!

2008
01:44:17,729 --> 01:44:21,907
Please stop! Hey, what
about my five stars?!

2009
01:44:25,259 --> 01:44:26,738
Oh, God!

2010
01:44:26,912 --> 01:44:28,262
Lindsay, honey, are you okay?

2011
01:44:28,436 --> 01:44:30,046
Papa Charlie ran away!

2012
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:31,500
He told the driver to pull over,

2013
01:44:31,569 --> 01:44:33,005
jumped out of the car and ran.

2014
01:44:33,179 --> 01:44:34,877
I'm scared. I'm in the woods.

2015
01:44:35,051 --> 01:44:37,793
Lindsay, don't worry. Look
around. Can you see anything?

2016
01:44:37,967 --> 01:44:40,535
I can see the road. Go there.
Go to the road.

2017
01:44:40,709 --> 01:44:41,884
We're gonna find you.

2018
01:44:49,413 --> 01:44:51,415
Mom! Mom!

2019
01:44:54,244 --> 01:44:55,376
Lindsay!

2020
01:44:57,029 --> 01:44:58,422
Sweetheart.

2021
01:45:01,382 --> 01:45:02,818
Come on, baby girl.

2022
01:45:02,992 --> 01:45:07,257
Oh, my God, Rex. I know. Let's find him.

2023
01:45:17,093 --> 01:45:18,660
Dad?

2024
01:45:18,834 --> 01:45:20,096
Papa Charlie? Dad?

2025
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:22,185
Charlie? LINDSAY: Papa Charlie?

2026
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:25,841
No, Dad. No. Please, Dad. Dad?

2027
01:45:26,015 --> 01:45:27,233
Charlie? REX: Dad?

2028
01:45:29,932 --> 01:45:31,368
Charlie!

2029
01:45:31,542 --> 01:45:32,543
Papa Charlie!

2030
01:45:32,717 --> 01:45:34,415
Charlie!

2031
01:45:36,242 --> 01:45:37,896
Dad! EMMA: Charlie!

2032
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:39,507
- Dad!
- Dad?

2033
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:41,639
Charlie! Papa Charlie!

2034
01:45:41,813 --> 01:45:44,381
Dad! Dad! EMMA: Charlie!

2035
01:45:44,555 --> 01:45:47,993
Dad! Papa Charlie, where are you?

2036
01:45:53,608 --> 01:45:55,044
Charlie!

2037
01:45:57,176 --> 01:45:58,787
Charlie.

2038
01:45:58,961 --> 01:46:00,832
Oh, hey.

2039
01:46:02,747 --> 01:46:04,009
Hey. Hey.Hey.

2040
01:46:08,318 --> 01:46:11,974
Hey. You okay? My feet are wet.

2041
01:46:12,148 --> 01:46:13,323
Mine are too.

2042
01:46:14,759 --> 01:46:16,282
Are you okay? You look so upset.

2043
01:46:16,457 --> 01:46:18,197
I'm just happy to see you.

2044
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:19,851
Dad.

2045
01:46:22,593 --> 01:46:23,986
What are you doing here?

2046
01:46:25,248 --> 01:46:27,511
Hi. Uh...

2047
01:46:27,685 --> 01:46:32,473
Well, I wanted to show
Lindsay Lake Charlie.

2048
01:46:32,647 --> 01:46:34,300
This was our happy place.

2049
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:38,392
See, sunsets,
we'd stand right here.

2050
01:46:38,566 --> 01:46:41,482
And... And we'd watch
the sun go down there

2051
01:46:41,656 --> 01:46:44,572
and, "Bye-bye, sun.
Bye-bye, sun."

2052
01:46:44,746 --> 01:46:45,790
Somebody would say that.

2053
01:46:45,964 --> 01:46:47,531
That was me, Dad.

2054
01:46:48,793 --> 01:46:50,708
I said that.Yeah.

2055
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:53,015
Mm-hm.

2056
01:46:57,323 --> 01:46:59,456
I'm sorry about your mother.No.

2057
01:46:59,630 --> 01:47:03,242
Dad, you don't have to... No, I have to.
I have to, Rex.

2058
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:05,680
Let me finish, because
I'm running out of words.

2059
01:47:10,206 --> 01:47:12,469
Francine, I was not
the reason your mom died.

2060
01:47:14,558 --> 01:47:18,127
That kid who ran the stop sign
was the reason your mom died.

2061
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:21,652
And I adored her so much.
I loved your mother so much.

2062
01:47:21,826 --> 01:47:24,089
And she died mad at me.

2063
01:47:24,263 --> 01:47:26,352
Dad.

2064
01:47:26,527 --> 01:47:29,617
I can't leave here knowing
that you're mad at me too.

2065
01:47:31,227 --> 01:47:33,925
I can't undo it.
I can't undo it.

2066
01:47:34,099 --> 01:47:36,319
There's no rewrites this time.

2067
01:47:36,493 --> 01:47:39,844
Come on. Relax.
Relax your hands.

2068
01:47:41,106 --> 01:47:42,934
No more fists. Relax your hands.

2069
01:47:48,026 --> 01:47:51,465
Dad. Why didn't you tell us?

2070
01:47:54,076 --> 01:47:57,035
Because I didn't know how.

2071
01:47:59,298 --> 01:48:00,298
And I was scared.

2072
01:48:01,649 --> 01:48:03,302
Of what?

2073
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:06,088
That maybe you wouldn't care.

2074
01:48:06,262 --> 01:48:07,481
Oh, Dad.

2075
01:48:10,527 --> 01:48:13,008
Forgive me. Please.

2076
01:48:13,182 --> 01:48:15,401
Forgive me
so I can forgive myself.

2077
01:48:15,576 --> 01:48:18,230
Because the sight of your
angry eyes keeps me up at night

2078
01:48:18,404 --> 01:48:21,407
and gives me the sweats, and
there's no more time for that.

2079
01:48:21,582 --> 01:48:24,062
There's no more time.
I'm here today.

2080
01:48:24,236 --> 01:48:26,282
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

2081
01:48:26,456 --> 01:48:31,505
Franny, it's okay. It's okay.
I understand. I understand.

2082
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:33,289
I love you, Pop. Oh!

2083
01:48:33,463 --> 01:48:35,378
I love you. LINDSAY: Is there room for me?

2084
01:48:35,552 --> 01:48:37,598
Come here, sweetie.
I love you too, you know?

2085
01:48:40,688 --> 01:48:42,907
Emma. Emma. Come here.

2086
01:48:48,086 --> 01:48:50,306
Oh, God.
What a long time between hugs.

2087
01:49:01,143 --> 01:49:04,320
Mom was always
inventing days for the kids.

2088
01:49:04,494 --> 01:49:06,496
Kids loved
"Backwards Day" the best.

2089
01:49:06,670 --> 01:49:08,933
We'd have dinner for breakfast
and breakfast for dinner.

2090
01:49:09,107 --> 01:49:10,935
No, Pop.
It was "Upside-down Day."

2091
01:49:11,109 --> 01:49:12,589
Upside-down day.
God, I loved that.

2092
01:49:12,763 --> 01:49:14,156
We'd have cake for breakfast.

2093
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:15,723
Can we do that?
Yeah.

2094
01:49:15,897 --> 01:49:17,812
Will you do it with us,
Papa Charlie and Emma?

2095
01:49:17,986 --> 01:49:20,379
Absolutely. Yeah, sure. Anything for you.

2096
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:24,079
Is it upside-down day? Yeah.
Upside-down day.

2097
01:49:24,253 --> 01:49:26,081
I got it.
Upside-down day is great.

2098
01:49:26,255 --> 01:49:28,170
Yeah? DARRELL: This'll be really good.

2099
01:49:28,344 --> 01:49:29,344
Okay.

2100
01:49:30,607 --> 01:49:31,782
Huh.

2101
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:35,786
Hey, Rex, um...
Oh, tell them the story

2102
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,788
about when Dad
was barbecuing outside,

2103
01:49:37,962 --> 01:49:40,269
he was making all these
hot dogs and a bear came.

2104
01:49:40,443 --> 01:49:42,619
Oh, heh-heh! That's
a really good story.

2105
01:49:42,793 --> 01:49:47,668
Okay, I think it was July 4th? Uh-huh.
Dad loves 4th of July.

2106
01:49:53,238 --> 01:49:54,544
It's beautiful here.

2107
01:49:54,718 --> 01:49:55,937

2108
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:01,638
