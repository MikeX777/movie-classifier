00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:12,221
Do you remember when I made you that mix tape of break-up songs

355
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:15,006
and then Matt broke it,
and you were really upset,

356
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,098
- so then you made me a mix tape of all ironic songs.
- Ironic songs, yeah.

357
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,361
Gee, but Matt always
made it about him.

358
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,711
I know, I can't believe
he got someone to marry him.

00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:28,064
So, this was both your idea?

530
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,370
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

531
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:31,590
I asked and she said yes.

532
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,940
- I said yes.
- Yeah, awesome.

533
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:36,856
Well, marriage is a lot of work.

534
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:38,945
I know that, Mama.

535
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:40,686
Do you?

536
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:44,428
- Oh my gosh, I couldn't be happier for the two of you.
- Yeah.

537
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:47,344
Thank you, Mom.
Finally some positivity.

538
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:49,390
So you're moving, right?

539
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,826
- Yes, I am moving out.
- Yeah.

540
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,219
Where are you gonna live?

541
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:53,699
Uh, we're not sure yet.

542
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:57,572
Well I thought maybe my place in LA.
Is that cool?

543
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,095
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

544
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:00,706
Yeah, LA.

545
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:02,490
And I also thought
we could drive together.

546
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,188
- Have a little road trip.
- Do you have a car here?

547
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:06,755
No, it's in LA, but you--

548
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,931
Oh, I share a car
with Claire, so.

549
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:13,109
Yeah, her engine blew up because she didn't put enough oil in it.

550
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:14,894
That's not actually
what happened, Mom.

551
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:17,026
It is.
Cookies, everybody.

552
00:27:19,986 --> 00:27:21,683
Charlie how could
you possibly think...

553
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,946
What are you gonna do,
the Lyft thing?

554
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,210
You were gonna be star.
What happened to all those videos?

555
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:30,649
The real conversation is-- Do you want this?
Is this what you want?

556
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,565
Guys, guys.
Stop it!

557
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:37,394
Stop it right now! Stop it!
Stop it!

558
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:40,702
Stop it! Listen.
This is a good thing.

559
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,704
I did it.
I did this thing.

560
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,663
Technically, we did it.

561
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:48,405
- I'm so sorry, yes, we.
- I understand, it's a new thing.

562
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:49,711
- But we.
- Yeah.

563
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:50,843
Right, we get to say we now.

564
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,801
- We're a we.
- We're a we.

565
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,760
Yeah, and we're happy.

566
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:57,588
So, you guys be happy,

Oh... Hey.

591
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:22,108
Do you wanna go to the beach?

592
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,936
Like the actual beach?

593
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,808
Yeah, first time in LA,
isn't that the first thing you do?

594
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,811
Um, no, it's
like 20 miles away.

595
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:31,552
I've never actually
been to the beach here.

596
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,336
Oh my God, really? Why?

597
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,818
It's freezing, dude.
Like, you need a wet suit if you wanna go in.

598
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,080
Hell no.

599
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:40,561
They didn't wear
wet suits on Baywatch.

600
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:43,999
That year's show was
shot in Hawaii, so.

601
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:45,044
Yeah.

602
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,569
- Hey.
- Yeah?

603
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:50,876
Remember that
New Year's that we didn't

604
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,660
have any plans and
hated everyone else's,

605
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,357
so we drove four
hours to the beach

606
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:56,969
and went skinny-dipping
and got arrested?

607
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,666
Yeah.

608
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:01,234
That was actually the last
time I went to the beach.

609
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:02,801
You wanna go again?

610
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:06,239
Good morrow, Charles,
and congratulations to me.

611
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:09,808
It is official, I am a licensed minister,
it just came in the mail.

612
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,855
Best 20 bucks I've spent since I got
those As Seen on TV furniture coasters.

613
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,248
Ah, sweet.

614
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,728
Oh, oh, Hannah.

615
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:21,645
This is my roommate, Bruce,
and this is my wife, Hannah.

616
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,387
- Hi.
- 'Sup?

617
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,825
Yeah.
What are you doing today, buddy?

618
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:29,610
Big day.
Big, big, big day.

619
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:33,875
He's so
good on that thing.

620
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,964
- I got it, I got it.
- You got it?

621
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,794
- This was great.
- Ciao.

622
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:42,710
He's great.

623
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:44,843
So, you wanna come chill?

624
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,194
How many bedrooms is this?

625
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:49,891
Oh, just the one.

626
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,762
Oh, okay, but I have
the bedroom area,

627
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:54,504
and Bruce, he's got
the living room area.

628
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,985
We're kind of in his
space right now, but...

629
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,640
This is awesome, you know?

630
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:02,599
I get to live with my
best friend and my wife

631
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,384
in the same place.

632
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:06,125
I always hoped that
that would be possible,

633
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:08,867
but I didn't know if that
could work out, you know?

634
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,999
- Thank you, honey.
- Yeah.

635
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:16,918
Hey. You wanna go to a restaurant,
get some food or somethin'?

636
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,572
Yeah. We should--

637
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,879
I mean, what type of food
do you like?

638
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,532
Whatever.

639
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:26,014
All right, well, uh, what do
you feel for like right now?

640
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,973
Anything, I'm easy.

641
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:31,628
Cool, but do you see how,
like it would be really helpful

642
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:34,457
to me if you were a little more specific?
Just for--

643
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,547
We always ended up somewhere nonspecific and had a good time, right?

644
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:40,899
Yeah. Yeah.

645
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,380
Let's, uh, let's go.

646
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:46,687
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

647
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,908
It's the best day of my life.

648
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,692
After you, madame.
No, no, please allow me.

649
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,563
Oh thank you.

650
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:57,611
- Shit.
- What?

651
00:31:57,654 --> 00:32:01,006
I forgot to tell them
no tomatoes on my salad.

652
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,661
Oh, shit.
Um, you don't like tomatoes?

653
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,968
No, I'm like
allergic, deathly.

654
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:09,797
- You don't remember?
- Really? No.

655
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,669
No, but I do remember
your favorite food.

656
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,280
Nachos.

657
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,325
Husband points for me.

658
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,588
Yeah, it used to be.

659
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,939
You don't--
I thought your-- Oh.

660
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,943
Hey, let's do like a getting
to know you exercise.

661
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,422
Give me your phone.

662
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,511
- Straight for the phone, madame?
- I won't look at texts.

663
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:31,297
- I just wanna see your Google history.
- All right. Um...

664
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,386
- I promise.
- Okay, go ahead.

665
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,736
- I trust you.
- Okay.

666
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:36,998
Let's see.

667
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,305
What have you been searching?

668
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:44,614
"How to pass
the California smog test?"

669
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:47,008
Um... Okay.

670
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:50,272
- "Celebrities who've had late in life success."
- Okay.

671
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:53,406
- "People who achieve success over 30."
- I sense a theme.

672
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:57,584
- Stan Lee was 39 when he--
- Yeah. Yeah.

673
00:32:57,627 --> 00:33:00,500
There's still hope for me, huh?

674
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:03,024
All right, pass it over.
Let me see yours.

675
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,112
No.

676
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,855
No?

677
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:12,860
Fine, I don't need to see it.

678
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,905
Ask me another question.

679
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:19,910
When's the last
time you had sex?

680
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:20,999
Oh.

681
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,654
- You really wanna know?
- Mm-hm.

682
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:26,265
Oh, okay.

683
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,095
Two weeks ago?

684
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,973
You don't wanna ask me when the last time I had sex was?

685
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,670
Absolutely not.

686
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:41,758
- Okay.
- Okay.

687
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:44,065
No. Please don't tell me.

688
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,024
Let me ask you something.

689
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,677
Let's see.

690
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:50,028
What do you wanna do for work?

691
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,855
I don't really know.

692
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,511
I used to be in pharmaceutical sales, but, now,
it's not what I want--

693
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,296
Why are you laughing?

694
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:00,081
Um, nothing, it's just,

695
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:03,345
every like hot girl in my college studied pharmaceutical sales

696
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:06,218
if she wanted to marry
a doctor, you know?

697
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,089
- Oh.
- All right.

698
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,873
- Thank you.
- So for sauces,

699
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,311
we have lemon aioli,
mesquite barbecue--

700
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:17,055
Oh my God,
you're gonna have to roll me out on a stretcher with these fries.

701
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,013
And jalapeno mustard.

702
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:22,277
Actually, make that
two stretchers please.

703
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:25,454
'Cause, you know, we're married now,
so I wanna, I wanna roll out with her.

704
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:28,109
We roll deep, I would say.

705
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:29,328
Okay.

706
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,245
Bon appetit, my love.

707
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:36,204
Oh, anyway, I do have a lot of savings,
so I just thought

708
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:39,686
I'd skate for a while
and see what happens.

709
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:43,516
Would you like to like,
just run off to Mexico?

710
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,126
- What?
- No, look.

711
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,172
We could like live on a beach
and sell things.

712
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,304
Um, why Mexico?

713
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:51,959
Well, I mean you speak
Spanish, and then I kind of--

714
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:55,397
I don't speak Spanish.
Why would I speak Spanish?

715
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:58,748
But you lived in Spain
for like two years.

716
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:01,273
Yeah, but everyone
there speaks English too.

717
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:02,970
Like for a second, I
thought that you would

718
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:05,146
be too busy reading
The Alchemist to remember

719
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,235
your white privilege,
but gracias.

720
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:10,412
Yeah. No, totally. I mean,
at least I left the state.

721
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,459
Did you also go to
India by any chance?

722
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:15,722
You know, really find
yourself, enlightenment.

723
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,027
No, I mean, you know,

724
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:18,551
I had experiences,
I made mistakes

725
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:19,856
and then I became a grown-up.

726
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,163
And when you do that,
you'll also be able

727
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,773
to share those things.

728
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,427
Wow.

729
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,821
Actually, well played.

730
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:30,171
Don't worry, I don't want
a big ring or anything.

731
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:32,826
I'm not like that kind of adult.

732
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,176
Yeah, like a wedding ring?

733
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,048
Yeah, I mean, to be
clear, I do want a ring.

734
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:40,703
Just not like a big one.

735
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:43,576
Why would you want--
You hate jewelry.

736
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,795
People change.

737
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,190
No they don't, I
mean, not really.

738
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:53,107
Yeah, actually, they do. But...

739
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:03,248
What the hell are you wearing?

740
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,597
My PJs.

741
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,252
Yeah, but like, it's
our wedding night.

742
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,210
You look like you
just had a baby,

743
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,516
like a big one.

744
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,213
Yeah, well you're
wearing a T-shirt.

745
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,606
A muscle T-shirt.

746
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:15,999
I'm not showing you mine
until you show me yours.

747
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:17,740
- Oh, is that how it works, then?
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:19,220
Well, I've got something
to show you then.

749
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:22,180
I didn't know-- Come here.
Come here, yeah.

750
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,225
All right, it's a secret,
so I gotta tell you real close.

751
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:27,185
What?

752
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,883
Oh hey. Sorry.
Gotta go TT.

753
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,540
Hi.

754
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,021
It's a one bathroom.

755
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,330
Sorry, I'll be quick.

756
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,027
- Great.
- Great.

757
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,205
Oh.

758
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,990
Hey. Dosey-doe, my lady.

759
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:54,777
Clementine.
She makes hemp soap.

760
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,257
You love that soap.

761
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:58,128
I think she could be the one.

762
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,000
Really happy for you dude.

763
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,306
Oh, there she is.

764
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,611
Hi, nice to meet you.

765
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:04,047
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

766
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,658
Those PJs,
really good PJs.

767
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:07,703
Have a good night, thank you.

768
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,924
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

769
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,796
I can't do it, Chuckie.

770
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,363
Please don't say that, Hannah.

771
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:18,192
I can't.
There is no room for me here.

772
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,846
Yeah, but I'll make room.

773
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:22,892
I'll do it, like, I'll make,

774
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:26,331
just, we gotta give
it a shot, you know?

775
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,856
I know actually.

776
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:31,727
You see, there's
this rule in life--

777
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:33,555
it's been that way
for generations--

778
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,470
that if a man writes you a song,
you can't leave him.

779

789
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:02,062
- You've done enough.
- Oh man, every time.

790
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,846
- Oh yeah.
- Give me some space.

791
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,326
- You're such a nerd.
- Am I, really?

792
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,806
Yeah.

793
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,636
Oh, um...

794
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,333
No, ow.

795
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:14,814
- Okay, wait.
- Why? That feels...

796
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:17,120
No. Sorry.

797
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:18,731
Sorry, it just didn't feel good.

798
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:20,341
I thought it would feel better.

799
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,691
I should've asked you.
Okay, so...

800
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,693
We can figure this out, right?

801
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:26,347
So what do you like?

802
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:29,350
I'm sorry.
I know some of this just takes time.

803
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,874
Well, it wouldn't take time if you just tell me what you like.

804
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:35,182
I don't care, like, you
can tell me anything.

805
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,489
Okay.

806
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:40,361
Well, um, I guess the first
thing you need to know

807
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:43,408
is that I actually
don't orgasm any way

808
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:46,454
except through oral.

809
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,327
Oh, I'm sorry.

810
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:53,026
You don't come from sex?

811
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,464
No, it's actually
pretty common.

812
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:59,162
No. Not for any
of my exes it wasn't.

813
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:03,819
Well, like 70 %
of women don't come

814
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:06,779
through intercourse,
so, that's unlikely.

815
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:10,783
I don't know,
'cause that really hasn't been my experience, you know?

816
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,915
Just mine personally, you know?

817
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:16,919
But I'm saying it probably has been your experience,
you just haven't noticed.

818
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:21,271
How can you insult me in bed while you haven't even tried me.

819
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,535
Okay.
I'm sorry, you're right.

820
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:26,886
But, you know, you asked.

821
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:30,977
No, I'm sorry.
You know what? Um...

822
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,892
These things probably
do take time, right?

823
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,808
So let's just try another day.

824
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,902
Just, I'm kind of tired,
and it's kind of hard to--

825
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:45,426
Yeah, fine, me too.

826
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,819
So, yeah.

827
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:53,173
Do you really not
have a second pillow?

828
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,483
Here, honey.

829
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:02,574
- I didn't wanna take--
- I'm saying here, all right?

830
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,445
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

831
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,578
- It's generous.
- God...

832
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:15,456
Good night.

833
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,937
- Do you not have a top sheet?
- Seriously?

834
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,417
♪

835
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:24,857
Sorry, I keep
forgetting my toothbrush.

836
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,033
Are you sure it's okay
that I'm using yours?

837
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:28,730
Yeah, no worries.
Go nuts.

838
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:37,957
Hey, why is there only one
toothbrush in this bathroom?

839
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,742
- What do you mean?
- I mean, where's Bruce's?

840
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:44,485
Oh!

841
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:47,140
Oh, you got the...

842
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:49,534
No, there.

843
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:53,451
Why am I doing this?

844
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,326
Aah, that burns.

845
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,546
Charlie, your wife is here.

846
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:03,678
- Oh yeah. What? Hey.
- Hi!

847
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:05,245
- Look at this.
- I know.

848
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:07,421
- You're at work. Hi.
- Yeah.

849
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,988
This is great.

850
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:10,772
Yeah, it's a gym, you know.

851
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,295
What are you doing here?

852
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:14,602
Oh, I just needed to run errands
and I don't have a car.

853
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:17,083
- Can I borrow yours? Great.
- Oh yeah, sure.

854
00:41:17,126 --> 00:41:19,041
- It's out there.
- Great.

855
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:22,349
Um, shit, you know what?
Yeah.

856
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:25,395
You could join the gym,
and I could personal train you.

857
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,441
We can do, like,
couples do things.

858
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,836
Oh, I'm, uh...
Maybe tomorrow?

859
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:33,621
- Yeah, yeah, another time.
- After, when I get settled.

860
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,842
- The thing, okay, cool.
- Okay. Fine.

861
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,800
- Okay, buh-bye.
- Bye ya.

862
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:42,456
Your wife?

863
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,327
- Yeah.
- You got married?

864
00:41:44,371 --> 00:41:47,461
Yeah, it's actually
a super long story.

865
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,637
It's actually not
very long at all.

866
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:53,336
I got married,
and that's my wife.

867
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,600
No, no, dude.

868
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,384
We were just casual.

869
00:41:57,427 --> 00:41:58,559
We never had the talk.

870
00:41:58,603 --> 00:41:59,865
Yo, you got married?

871
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:01,649
You got married?

872
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:02,998
Good luck with that, bro.

873
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,478
Yeah, good luck

00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:02,581
Dude, but I married
my best friend.

1051
00:51:02,624 --> 00:51:04,931
Like, isn't that what people
want to do with their lives?

1052
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:07,020
You did not marry
your best friend.

1053
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,544
It's impossible that every married person is married to their best friend.

1054
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:11,981
Case in point, I am your
best friend, not her.

1055
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:14,245
Besides, have you looked at
your bird's book collection?

1056
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:16,160
- She has all the Bukowskis man.
- All of 'em.

1057
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:18,292
- Yeah, I love that about her.
- Not a good thing.

1058
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:21,339
You should know better than to get involved
with a girl who's too into Bukowski.

1059
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:27,301
- Hey guys.
- Oh, hey.

1060
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:31,131
- Hey, where's Barry?
- Built her a crib.

1061
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:34,003
Oh.

1062
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:35,353
Hey, um, Chuckie.

1063
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,616
Wanna come talk to me in
the bedroom for a second?

1064
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:39,226
- Right now? Okay.
- Don't, don't.

1065
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,315
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't.

1066
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,361
- 'Cause we're in the middle.
- I know, but, sorry.

1067
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:45,145
- Sorry, Bruce.
- Wife.

1068
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:46,886
I have a wife.

1069
00:51:46,929 --> 00:51:48,540
All right.

1070
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:51,673
- I see a bow.
- Mm-hmm.

1071
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:55,199
What?

1072
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,158
Oh wow.

1073
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,594
I, uh...

1074
00:51:59,638 --> 00:52:01,030
I know you're
a little short on cash,

1075
00:52:01,074 --> 00:52:03,903
so I thought I
could help you out.

1076
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:06,035
You could also teach
me how to play guitar.

1077
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,037
I could pay you for that.

1078
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:09,517
I've always wanted to learn.

1079
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:11,998
- You'd want to give me money to...?
- Yeah.

1080
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,827
- What do you think?
- Well, thank you, yeah.

1081
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,830
- No, it's, really thoughtful.
- Oh, one more.

1082
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:19,440
- There you go.
- You got it?

1083
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:21,964
Oh, cool.

1084
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:26,752
Thank you.

1085
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:28,710
You're welcome.

1086
00:52:28,754 --> 00:52:29,885
Hey.

1087
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:33,280
I love you.

1088
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,327
You don't have to say
that right now.

1089
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:40,026
I just, you know, say
it when you feel it.

1090
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:47,729
- Thank, um...
- Thank you's fine.

1091
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:50,297
You know, sir, Hannah's
the first girl I ever loved.

1092
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:51,864
And now she's back in my life.

1093
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,214
Which I think says
something about her.

1094
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,868
Or not much about
all the girls you've

1095
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,217
gotten to know since.

1096
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:59,654
No, no, no, no we used
to stand for something.

1097
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:01,308
Nice shot.

1098
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:03,223
We rebelled against
the establishment.

1099
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:05,312
Well, you kids had to
invent things to rebel against

1100
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:07,314
'cause you had too much
time on your hands.

1101
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:09,838
And the baton continues
to be passed, Gramps.

1102
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:11,840
Kids today will never understand
what we had to go through

1103
00:53:11,884 --> 00:53:13,320
just to watch porn.

1104
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:15,235
Oh, the dark ages.

1105
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:18,107
My grandparents
married because life was

1106
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:20,197
too unbearable to go it alone.

1107
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,982
This notion of love and marriage
came from the Renaissance,

1108
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:26,028
back when artists had time
and money to sit around

1109
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:29,554
and jerk off and
write songs and paint.

1110
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:31,556
Ah, history is so cool.

1111
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,993
Yeah, well, you kids
are fuckin' it up.

1112
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:38,911
Boom
goes the dynamite.

1113
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,480
But the marijuana
has gotten better,

1114
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:43,959
I'll give you kids that.

1115
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:45,265
- Thank you.
- Oh yeah.

1116
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:48,660
Yep, you're welcome
there, Bruce the First.

1117
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,664
Do you have any?
Like right now?

1118
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:54,274
Am I holding? No.

1119
00:53:57,277 --> 00:54:00,106
That was really nice hanging out with Bruce the First.
Thanks for the invite.

1120
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:01,890
- BTF, love him.
- Yeah.

1121
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,806
How long ago
did his wife pass?

1122
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,852
- The first lady?
- Yeah.

1123
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:10,159
Eight years.

1124
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:12,684
- I bet you they were awesome together, huh?
- Oh, shit.

1125
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:15,295
Man, they loved the
crap out of each other.

1126
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,992
She was pretty hot, too.

1127
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:19,691
- That's your grandmother...
- For being my grandma, yeah.

1128
00:54:19,734 --> 00:54:23,042
- ...that you're speaking of.
- I know, objectively, though.

1129
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:26,306
It's been all right since she's been gone,
but not quite the same.

1130
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,656
I don't know, man,
sometimes it seems nice

1131
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,571
to have a little
alone time, you know?

1132
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:32,834
I don't think when
you're that old.

1133
00:54:32,878 --> 00:54:35,315
I don't know, we used
to do a really good job

1134
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,970
of growing old together.

1135
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:41,016
I don't know what
we're gonna do now.

1136
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,148
Well...

1137
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:46,065
There you go.

1138
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:53,290
Oh shit, sweet.

1139
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:04,779
Hannah?

1140
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:06,303
- Hannah?
- In here!

1141
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,696
Hey, honey.

1142
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,178
Oh man, I wish you wouldn't
eat in the bed because

1143
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:13,832
we might get roaches.

1144
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:15,399
Okay.

1145
00:55:15,442 --> 00:55:16,835
- How was your day?
- Good.

1146
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:18,489
I actually, I found
out that one of my friends

1147
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:21,753
from college lives here now,
so I'm gonna see her tomorrow.

1148
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:24,321
And somebody's all
set up in LA now.

1149
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:26,323
Oh yeah.

1150
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,194
I got you something.

1151
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:30,849
What?

1152
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:34,374
Best husband in the world award.

1153
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:36,245
I hope you like it.

1154
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:38,422
- You're so nice.
- No, no, whatever.

1155
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:43,470
What did you get me?

1156
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:49,084
Yoga pants.
You always are lounging around in your sweatpants,

1157
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:52,131
so I figured these are snugger and a little cuter and,
you know.

1158
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,047
- Yoga pants.
- Thanks.

1159
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:59,399
I love you.

1160
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:03,229
It's an amazing day, huh?

1161
00:56:03,272 --> 00:56:04,317
Great day.

1162
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:07,538
I cannot believe you're here.

1163
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:09,409
How's David?

1164
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:13,195
- We're, uh, we're not really.
- Got ya.

1165
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:15,763
You can totally keep
that towel set I got you.

1166
00:56:15,807 --> 00:56:18,070
Thanks.
That's generous.

1167
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:20,464
Um, yeah, I'm actually,
I'm married to someone

1168
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:23,031
I went to high school with.
I recently remarried.

1169
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:25,294
Oh, sweet.

1170
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,296
You married someone
your own age?

1171
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,255
Yeah, why?

1172
00:56:29,298 --> 00:56:32,867
This is LA, it's just that it's unusual.
Just a little bit.

1173
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,782
It's just really,
really hard to keep up

1174
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:37,219
unless you're married to someone
who's at least 15 years older than you.

1175
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:39,613
- Why?
- Because you look terrible in pictures.

1176
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,223
It lasts forever.

1177
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,051
Well, you do know about
the arm thing, though, right?

1178
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:45,880
- What arm thing?
- Yeah, well the, the arm thing.

1179
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:48,317
Are you not doing
that in photos?

1180
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:50,450
No, is that?

1181
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,713
- It's really easy to pick up.
- Thank you.

1182
00:56:52,757 --> 00:56:55,455
Ugh. I didn't know
I was doing it wrong.

1183
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,414
But we gotta
work on those 11s.

1184
00:56:57,457 --> 00:57:00,417
- What's an 11?
- That furrow.

1185
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,680
- Oh, my forehead?
- No, don't!

1186
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:06,466
- Don't touch your face.
- Oh my God, why am I not supposed to touch my face?

1187
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,122
- Never too early to start on that neck.
- Never, never.

1188
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:11,776
Is there something
wrong with my neck?

1189
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,343
No, just the same thing that's wrong with everyone's neck.

1190
00:57:14,387 --> 00:57:17,782
Well, you know,
I'm just to the kind of girl who does Botox.

1191
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:19,827
Why not?
- My husband would hate it.

1192
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,047
Oh. I doubt that.

1193
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:24,832
No, really, he's...

1194
00:57:26,617 --> 00:57:28,140
He did get me yoga pants.

1195
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:29,794
Oh, exactly.

1196
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:32,884
He's basically asking
you to try harder.

1197
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,538
Wow.

1198
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:37,366
But honey...
Look, don't worry about it.

1199
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,413
If he can't handle
you at your worst...

1200
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:45,462
He doesn't
deserve you at your best.

1201
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:48,769
I can't cheers to that. I'm sorry,
did you quote Marilyn Monroe?

1202
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:51,642
- Yeah.
- Well, don't you think that's part of the problem?

1203
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:55,907
Like, maybe if she, like,
had a man who didn't

1204
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,476
put up with her pill popping,
she'd still be alive?

1205
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:02,217
No.

1206
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:05,960
That's a rose-colored
glasses kind of a thought.

1207
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:08,180
Cute.

1208
00:58:08,223 --> 00:58:10,530
Honey, what happened?

1209
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:13,446
- What happened?
- I got Botox.

1210
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,622
- You got Botox?
- Yeah.

1211
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,495
Um...

1212
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:20,540
My face is ruined.

1213
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,020
No, it's not bad.

1214
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:23,543
Ruined is a really strong word.

1215
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:24,892
You just can't laugh.

1216
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:26,633
Or smile.

1217
00:58:26,677 --> 00:58:29,114
But you haven't been
much of that anyways, so.

1218
00:58:30,463 --> 00:58:32,204
Hey.

1219
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:35,076
Hey, where's Barry?

1220
00:58:40,299 --> 00:58:41,343
Uh...

1221
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:45,478
Were you guys
smoking weed in here?

1222
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:49,874
- Just a little bit.
- You guys...

1223
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:53,573
You hot-boxed the living
room with a baby in it?

1224
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,053
Shh. She's sleeping.

1225
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:58,578
No, no, no.
I pulled her outside.

1226
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:00,754
I'm sorry.

1227
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:03,627
All right, cool, that's,
that's what it takes to make you smile.

1228
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,672
That's great.
That's rich.

1229
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:07,326
I'm not laughing at you.
- It's okay.

1230
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:10,372
- It was medicinal. The Botox--
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

1231
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:13,071
Just gonna be in
my room, all right?

1232
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:19,643
That's it.

1233
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:24,604
We're gonna get really
adult up in here.

1234
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,301
Who's excited?
Me!

1235

I am. Okay?

1236
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:29,696
Let me break this down.

1237
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,438
There's currently four and
a half people living here,

1238
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:34,875
and the place is a fucking mess.

1239
00:59:34,919 --> 00:59:36,268
So, sweetheart.

1240
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:39,924
Would you like...

1241
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,231
trash duty,

1242
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:45,625
Sunday or Monday? Hmm?

1243
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,235
Monday or Sunday?

1244
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:48,976
Chuckie, I'm your wife,
I'm not roommate.

1245
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,196
You can't put me on
like some chores list.

1246
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:52,719
Seriously?

1247
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:55,374
Because so far, I can't
tell the difference.

1248
00:59:58,029 --> 00:59:59,683
Monday it is.
Congratulations.

1249
00:59:59,726 --> 01:00:02,555
You've got trash and
dish duty on Mondays.

1250
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,776
You my friend, are gonna
check into a hotel. Tonight.

1251
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:08,605
And you're gonna stop smoking weed around your child,
do you understand me?

1252
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:10,432
Ooh, and that.

1253
01:00:10,476 --> 01:00:12,043
That piece of
richness right here.

1254
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:13,697
Sorry, honey.
Sorry.

1255
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,394
You're gonna find a
new place for this

1256
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:17,744
that isn't my
living room, please.

1257
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:19,920
- What, where?
- I don't know.

The seat is broken.

Fix it.

Is she around?

She went to the coffee
shop around the corner.

- All right.
- Yeah.

1279

You two have both been secretly
using their bathroom to shit,

1280
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,822
you know, since she moved in.

1281

married until you're comfortable

- Hey, buddy.

You can't sleep here.
No sleeping in the car.

Not like that.

girl, she just finally

match the inside.

01:16:53,043 --> 01:16:54,261
I kind of lied.

1566
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:56,568
She didn't go to any meetings.

1567
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,657
She kind of freaked out on me and she needed some space.

1568
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:01,355
Whoa, okay.

1569
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:03,314
Oh, dear God.

1570
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:06,360
We gotta clean this place up 'cause
she cannot see that we live in squalor.

1571
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:09,581
- Oh hey.
- Let's not throw around the S word.

1572
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,583
It's like a storage unit
inside here.

1573
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,498
If we can just sort of
clean some of it up?

1574
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:14,847
Come on, guys. Help.

1575
01:17:14,891 --> 01:17:16,457
- All right.
- All right.

1576
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:17,850
I'll smoke this bong.

1577
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:22,594
I'll get it.

1578
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,427
Hi. This was outside.

1579
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,950
Oh, perfect.

1580
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:34,562
- Hey, honey. Oh, okay.
- Hi! Oh, my darling!

1581
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:37,261
Oh, I missed you so much.

1582
01:17:37,304 --> 01:17:39,785
- What about me?
- Yeah.

1583
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:41,569
Hi.

1584
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:43,267
It's me, Charlie.

1585
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,840
Uh, this is a...

1586
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:52,711
a nice place.

1587
01:17:52,755 --> 01:17:54,757
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1588
01:18:04,462 --> 01:18:05,637
Good night, guys.

1589
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,726
Good night.

1590
01:18:15,255 --> 01:18:16,300
Hey.

1591
01:18:21,784 --> 01:18:24,308
Who's that really good-looking dude talking to Hannah out there?

1592
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,831
Oh, that's her ex-husband.

1593
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:29,139
Her what?

1594
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:31,619
Oh, um, it's her ex-husband?

1595
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:34,666
Um...

1596
01:18:47,548 --> 01:18:48,811
Sorry.

1597
01:18:50,551 --> 01:18:52,771
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

1598
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:54,773
I don't know.

1599
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:57,167
Does he have to be
so good-looking?

1600
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:00,736
What does he do?

1601
01:19:04,217 --> 01:19:05,610
He's a...

1602
01:19:05,653 --> 01:19:08,221
- He's a doctor.
- He's a doctor. Yeah.

1603
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:10,006
Of course he is.

1604
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:12,225
Oh God.

1605
01:19:16,186 --> 01:19:19,755
Look, the way you live your life is just not an option for most people.

1606
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:23,062
And why is that, Hannah?

1607
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:25,630
I don't know, I tried.

1608
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:28,459
Hey, I really,
really tried, okay?

1609
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:36,772
♪ Fuck the world, I'm
hanging out with you tonight ♪

1610
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,558
Oh, I'm sorry.

1611
01:19:40,601 --> 01:19:41,777
No, actually.

1612
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:43,996
Come in.

1613
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,433
Just chill in the bathroom?

1614
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:49,262
Just... I wanna talk
for a second.

1615
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,922
What are you doing here, man?

1616
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:59,795
She called me up.
Said she needed some help.

1617
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:01,579
- Yeah, when?
- Yesterday.

1618
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:04,582
She said there was something
about you wanted to kill her?

1619
01:20:04,625 --> 01:20:06,236
- No, I just...
- I get it.

1620
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:07,846
I don't even need
to know the details.

1621
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,935
I don't even wanna
know the details, but...

1622
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:13,373
So, what happened?

1623
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,898
She called me up,
she said she needed--

1624
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:17,725
No, just, like before.

1625
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:20,337
Like you and her, what happened?

1626
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:25,472
I don't even know.

1627
01:20:25,516 --> 01:20:29,302
Maybe I spent too much time
thinking about what she needed,

1628
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:31,348
none of what she wanted.

1629
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:38,877
Um, what do you think, um...

1630
01:20:38,921 --> 01:20:41,445
What do you think she wants?

1631
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:44,317
I think she just wants
a partner in crime.

1632
01:20:44,361 --> 01:20:46,015
I mean, literally.

1633
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:49,018
Literally.

1634
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:54,327
- Um, can I...?
- Oh yeah. Just go.

1635
01:20:54,371 --> 01:20:56,677
- Yeah.
- Um, thank you.

1636
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:58,331
- Let's not touch.
- Yeah, let's not.

1637
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:01,160
So, have you met
any cool people here?

1638
01:21:01,204 --> 01:21:03,815
Not really.
Although I've never been

1639
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,339
good at making friends
as an adult.

1640
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,865
Also, all the women wanna
talk about here is like

1641
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:13,694
- yoga and genetically modified foods.
- Oh, God.

1642
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:16,523
Well, where I live,
it's their babies.

1643
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:18,743
And yoga.

1644
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:23,182
I mean, people are all the same,
it's just what nouns they fill in on their Mad Libs.

1645
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:25,010
The baby's asleep.

1646
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:27,099
Thanks, Bruce.

1647
01:21:27,143 --> 01:21:29,319
- Wanna join us?
- I'm good.

1648
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,236
So how is your marriage?

1649
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:35,586
It's a marriage.

1650
01:21:35,629 --> 01:21:38,023
They're all kind
of the same, right?

1651
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:40,417
Hmm...

1652
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:42,985
You know, it took years
for us to conceive?

1653
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:44,943
But ever since,
I've been terrified

1654
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:47,990
that it'll never be
as good as it was before.

1655
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:51,645
And everyone is always so focused on getting what they want.

1656
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:57,086
Or they get what they want
and they don't want it anymore.

1657
01:21:57,129 --> 01:21:59,349
It's all about the fantasy
staying a fantasy.

1658
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:01,177
Yeah.

1659
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:08,358
You're gonna drive?

1660
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:10,273
Well, it's a fluid situation.

1661
01:22:10,316 --> 01:22:12,971
- Yeah, that's true.
- What's going on, guys?

1662
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:15,234
About to take these
guys to the airport.

1663
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:17,454
- Ready?
- Yeah, I think so.

1664
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,108
- There she is.
- Hey.

1665
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:21,414
- Hey. Bye. Yeah.
- Leaving?

1666
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,286
- Take care, huh.
- Yeah. Take care.

1667
01:22:23,329 --> 01:22:24,983
- Beautiful baby.
- You got that?

1668
01:22:25,027 --> 01:22:26,115
Yeah.

1669
01:22:28,117 --> 01:22:30,119
- All right, bro.
- Love you, bro.

1670
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:33,644
Barry, thank Uncle Charlie.
Come on.

1671
01:22:33,687 --> 01:22:34,906
Ay!

1672
01:22:37,126 --> 01:22:38,823
Bye, guys, travel safe.

1673
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,971
- I like your hair like this.
- No talking.

1674
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,803
Are you coming home with me?

1675
01:23:05,067 --> 01:23:07,025
I don't know, maybe.

1676
01:23:07,069 --> 01:23:09,941
Maybe I wanna go to India and
like find myself or something.

1677
01:23:13,336 --> 01:23:15,729
I think that's a great idea.

1678
01:23:15,773 --> 01:23:17,688
I would love to come with you.

1679
01:23:18,776 --> 01:23:20,996
Or not.
You can go by yourself.

1680
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:22,736
Either way, I'll pay for it.

1681
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:27,002
Have you heard of The Alchemist?

1682
01:23:28,655 --> 01:23:30,048
No. Tell me.

What?

1685
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:59,121
- Get this shit away from me.
- Mr. First...

1686

Hey, it's Bruce the First, okay?

Hey, Grandpa,
how are you feelin'?

1688
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:07,955
God hates my guts.

1689
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:10,088
But enough about me.
How are you boys holding up?

1690
01:24:10,132 --> 01:24:12,003
Charlie's wife left him.

1691
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,440
Yeah, we don't know if she...

1692
01:24:14,484 --> 01:24:16,442
I mean, she literally left.

1693
01:24:16,486 --> 01:24:18,270
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1694
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:23,188
You know boys,
I married my best friend.

1695
01:24:23,232 --> 01:24:25,060
She was beautiful,

1696
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:28,063
so that certainly helped.

1697
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:31,022
Hannah was my best friend.

1698
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,893
We used to stay after
school and tell our parents

we were watching football,

1700
01:24:34,286 --> 01:24:37,115
but neither of us
cared much about sports.

1701
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:40,988
We'd just take the bus downtown and
listen to some punk bands all the time.
