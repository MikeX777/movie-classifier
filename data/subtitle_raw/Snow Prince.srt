1
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:32,321
You left home again?

2
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,657
For a bit.

3
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,520
No work today?

4
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,830
I quit.

5
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,294
In this economy?

6
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,268
You shouldn't act on a whim.

7
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,937
I guess not.

8
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,737
I'm like someone I know.

9
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:52,637
Who?

10
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,812
You, Grandma.

11
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,142
Want a crope bun?

12
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,446
From the Station?

13
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,583
Great!

14
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,690
I can stay till New Year's, right?

15
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,720
Let's see it in together for a change.

16
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,496
If your mother says it's all right.

17
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,626
She's mad at me for my quitting the job.

18
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,301
At least call her.

19
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,472
Aw...

20
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,176
Oh, this came for you.

21
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,211
An older man brought it.

22
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:35,679
Oh?

23
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,679
A Mr. 'Hagio'.

24
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,990
Never heard of him.

25
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,226
Yasuko, don't just accept

26
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,264
Whatever people bring around.

27
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,564
He could've been an old school friend.

28
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,038
He knows your maiden name.

29
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,768
He said he'd come back tomorrow.

30
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,281
He seemed nice enough.

31
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,754
Ms. ARIMA, Sayo

32
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,389
Hagio

33
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,542
Mother...

34
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,283
Yes?

35
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,286
I've practiced a lot!

36
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,617
So?

37
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,255
So I can go, right?

38
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,233
Sayo... be back in time for dinner, you hear?

39
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,837
Yes, ma'am!

40
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,233
Suddenly you have manners!

41
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,271
Bye!

42
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,533
Off you go.

43
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,817
Sota!

44
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,851
Don't!

45
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,056
You've practiced?

46
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,762
I'm getting better.

47
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,488
I'll play for you.

48
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,165
Sure.

49
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,546
What are you painting?

50
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,424
Why no leaves?

51
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,889
I like the roots.

52
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,590
The leaves and the flowers

53
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,927
are there because of the roots.

54
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,733
Roots work hard.

55
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:24,900
And they're the color of paint that Grandpa makes me.

56
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,604
He makes paint?

57
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,547
Yeah. He grinds up mugwort leaves.

58
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,018
Yeah?

59
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,545
I love your paintings.

60
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,354
When you're an artist, paint me.

61
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,150
Sure.

62
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,795
Together again!

63
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,124
Real good friends!

64
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,863
What do you want?

65
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,063
Wow!

66
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,341
Lt's really good.

67
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,309
He doesn't go to school,

68
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,874
That's because...

69
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,049
he's too poor to go to school,

70
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,115
So he paints all the time.

71
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,722
So if I was poor, I could paint?

72
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:11,548
Sure!

73
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,990
Play with him too much

74
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,060
and you'll smell like he does.

75
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,193
Come on!

76
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,422
In here!

77
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,304
We'll be safe here.

78
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,478
Good!

79
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,545
Chicken! Why did you run?

80
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,975
I don't want to fight.

81
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,016
Because you'll lose?

82
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,417
Stand Still.

83
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,033
Someone's coming.

84
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,974
Don't stop here!

85
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:38,842
Keep going!

86
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,074
Move!

87
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,481
This is no place to quit!

88
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,381
We're almost in town!

89
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,055
You had to have pups, huh?

90
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,594
Lie here till the crows get you, then!

91
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,232
Stupid dog!

92
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,570
That's horrible.

93
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,129
It's not moving.

94
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:33,897
It's dead.

95
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,706
Come on. Don't be scared.

96
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,777
This must be her puppy.

97
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,981
You can come with us.

98
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,414
It's OK, little 'Chibi'.

99
00:10:58,758 --> 00:10:59,452
Little 'Chibi'?

100
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,625
Yes, his name... We'll call him 'Chibi'.

101
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,301
Chibi...

102
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,506
We called him 'Chibi' because

103
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,805
he was small, but within a year...

104
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,479
he wasn't small any more.

105
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,994
Sota, Shall we eat?

106
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,026
Chibi must be hungry.

107
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,626
Come on, Chibi!

108
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,645
Here, Chibi.

109
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,679
Wow, potatoes!

110
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,755
What's the occasion?

111
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,959
Lt's getting colder.

112
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,249
We'll need our strength.

113
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,125
Eat up.

114
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,526
Sure!

115
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,800
That's sweet!

116
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,873
Chibi! Ready to work?

117
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,453
Here comes Chibi!

118
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,091
Good morning, Chibi!

119
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,259
Off you go!

120
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,630
Good morning.

121
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,983
Work hard, like Chibi!

122
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,092
I'll try my best!

123
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:32,926
Six bags in all, right?

124
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:33,697
Yes.

125
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,560
Sign here.

126
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,813
You write it.

127
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:49,342
Sure.

128
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,009
The Snow must be bad out your way.

129
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:56,947
Yes.

130
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,258
You can write!

131
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,427
I've been teaching him.

132
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,402
Aren't you lucky!

133
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:21,779
Harada, Sota

134
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,818
Chibi's Mother

135
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:47,936
Come on, Chibi.

136
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,798
I've got something here.

137
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,001
What?

138
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:47,322
What are those?

139
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,328
'Biscuits.'

140
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,125
My aunt brought them from Tokyo.

141
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:01,972
Good?

142
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,478
Sweeter than a potato.

143
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,810
My heart's pounding.

144
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,111
You're strange.

145
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,352
Draw this.

146
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,906
I'm learning a piece by Debussy.

147
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,414
When he died,

148
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,484
Erik Satie was very sad.

149
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,787
Are you listening?

150
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:17,521
Finished!

151
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,654
Wow! Good enough to eat!

152
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,021
There's some for you, too.

153
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:28,696
There.

154
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,563
Father!

155
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,307
What are you two up to?

156
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,509
You shouldn't be in here.

157
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,173
How did you know?

158
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,945
Parents know when children do wrong.

159
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,586
Is painting wrong?

160
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,380
No.

161
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,222
Sneaking around and hiding is.

162
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,797
Come on.

163
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,460
Sit properly.

164
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,978
What does drawing accomplish?

165
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,477
Bring me a small dish, would you?

166
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,118
Lt's done. Let's all have some.

167
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,213
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,227
Meet the payment schedule.

169
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,497
I'll leave that with you.

170
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,165
Oh, and put lights in the warehouse.

171
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,561
Wait a bit.

172
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,736
Light the Whole place.

173
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,232
That way we can work at night, too.

174
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,840
Take care of it.

175
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,192
Curry and rice! Sayo's favorite.

176
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,956
She's learned to play that piece of hers.

177
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,999
This is a reward.

178
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,193
Play it for me sometime.

179
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,898
Bon appetit.

180
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,309
Sayo, would you like a dog?

181
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,088
No. We've got Chibi.

182
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,692
Father, what don't you like about Sota?

183
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,722
You need more friends from school.

184
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:50,298
Why?

185
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,001
To broaden your horizons.

186
00:22:54,406 --> 00:23:00,470
Sota teaches me all about insects
and plants and things.

187
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,681
And he draws really well.

188
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,247
Do as you're told!

189
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,627
Telephone, Sir.

190
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:30,168
Oh, there's some sponge cake.

191
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,770
Let's have it later.

192
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,355
Are you OK, Grandpa?

193
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,253
It's just a cold.

194
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,106
Look, Grandpa.

195
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,872
Come on, Chibi!

196
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,488
They've got a trapeze.

197
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,922
Have you ever been to the circus?

198
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,255
No circuses. Circuses are bad.

199
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:33,555
Why?

200
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:34,856
Because...

201
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,159
Never go there.

202
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:45,876
We don't have any money for circuses.

203
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:06,622
Here.

204
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,469
This is about you.

205
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,472
Who wrote it?

206
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,766
I wish I knew.

207
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,176
Is it all true?

208
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:23,743
Probably.

209
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,108
'Probably'?

210
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,687
There are things I didn't know.

211
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,557
The circus?

212
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,720
That part's true.

213
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:39,759
The circus definitely came to town.

214
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,702
This is a piano, everyone.

215
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,904
Sayo Arima's father

216
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,137
has donated it to the School.

217
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:05,179
This will allow us to improve 
our music program.

218
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,354
Let's express our gratitude.

219
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,393
Thank you very much.

220
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,522
Thank you very much!

221
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,291
Mr. Arima, Would you say a few words?

222
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,172
Lt's easy to make sounds on the piano.

223
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,777
Touch it at first,

224
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,575
and feel the pleasure in that sound.

225
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,843
If you want to know anything, ask Sayo.

226
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,948
Miss Arima, would you care to play for us?

227
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,265
Come on, let's hear you.

228
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,461
Grandpa, wait...

229
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,078
She was practicing that...

230
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:36,998
Grandpa!

231
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:46,809
Sota, can you go to 
the warehouse by yourself?

232
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,851
The usual place.

233
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:50,850
All right.

234
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,850
And while you're there...

235
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,854
get the money, too.

236
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,329
I will.

237
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,232
Don't lose it.

238
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,251
There.

239
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,520
Well done.

240
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,027
How's your grandpa, by the way?

241
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,991
He says he just needs rest.

242
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,493
Overwork.

243
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,599
You and Chibi will have to

244
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:40,996
help him out.

245
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:41,933
Yes.

246
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,642
Here's this month's pay.

247
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:57,018
Go straight home, all right?

248
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,150
Whoops!

249
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,486
I'm Sorry, kid.

250
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,758
You OK?

251
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:13,794
Yes.

252
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,194
I'm sorry.

253
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:16,866
That's OK.

254
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,102
What's wrong?

255
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,198
It's OK.

256
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,250
Come over sometime.

257
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,554
Thank you.

258
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,617
Take care.

259
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,825
They're nice kids.

260
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,496
Let's have them over at Christmas.

261
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:07,546
Full of nutrition! Fresh-laid eggs!

262
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:11,514
Good hard-boiled, too!

263
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:15,753
4 cents each!

264
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:21,587
Fresh-laid eggs! Good for sickness, too!

265
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:26,700
Laid by our chickens this very morning!

266
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:31,673
I wonder if that'd make Grandpa better...

267
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,850
Cash up front, kid. You got money?

268
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,790
I had it here...

269
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,466
Yeah, sure! Get lost.

270
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:01,928
You'll hurt my business. Go away!

271
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:11,906
Chibi...

272
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:19,647
There it is!

273
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,509
Ah, you're back.

274
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,424
What's wrong?

275
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,458
Come here.

276
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,439
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

277
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,147
A man bumped into me.

278
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,549
Chibi barked, but I didn't notice

279
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,849
I'd been pick pocketed.

280
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,828
I went to buy you an egg,

281
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,589
and the money was gone!

282
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,455
Sota...

283
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,818
It's all right.

284
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,196
Grandpa, I'm sorry!

285
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,327
There was someone

286
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:24,096
Who needed it more than we do.

287
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,908
Let him have it.

288
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,246
Tomorrow we'll just

289
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,780
go to work and make some more.

290
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,376
It's all right!

291
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,521
Sota...

292
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,051
you mustn't hate people,

293
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,696
or hold grudges against them.

294
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:52,663
That just makes you sad.

295
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,242
It's all right.

296
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,126
A bean-cake!

297
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,497
That's charcoal!

298
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,602
Chibi!

299
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:39,012
Chibi!

300
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,013
Why did you walk away?

301
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,084
No reason.

302
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,326
Want to go see the circus?

303
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,190
The circus?

304
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,293
Lt's started.

305
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,502
Really?

306
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:45,873
Wow!

307
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,679
What do they have in there?

308
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,322
Lots of kidnapped kids, they say.

309
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,784
Really?

310
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,650
Let's go see.

311
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,054
Grandpa says circuses are bad.

312
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:02,730
You're scared!

313
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,091
No, I'm not!

314
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,861
Then come on.

315
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,304
Chibi wants to.

316
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,038
I brought some money.

317
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,111
I don't want it.

318
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,348
What do we do, then?

319
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,431
Where are the kids?

320
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,435
There aren't any, of course!

321
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,988
This looks like fun!

322
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,284
Don't touch anything!

323
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,859
Chicken! This is an adventure!

324
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:29,896
Look at this stuff! What's it all for?

325
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,454
Chibi!

326
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,847
You can't come in here!

327
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,142
I'm sorry!

328
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,493
Where did you sneak in?

329
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:26,393
We're sorry!

330
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:29,898
Your names?

331
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,101
Tell me!

332
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,606
Sota. Sota Harada.

333
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,972
Sayo Arima.

334
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,978
Sota and Sayo... perfect!

335
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,551
Lion's hungry.

336
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,386
We're sorry!

337
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:55,986
Forgive us!

338
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,035
Then maybe we'll take this dog.

339
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:12,438
You'll be a big hit with us, you know.

340
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,667
Don't take Chibi!

341
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,643
I do anything you want.

342
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,652
Anything?

343
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:23,944
Yes.

344
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,631
I will look into your heart,

345
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,698
and see if you're lying.

346
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,106
I'm starting to see...

347
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,282
Little by little...

348
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,848
Oh...

349
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,117
I see...

350
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,086
All right.

351
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:18,773
Let's run for it.

352
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:22,378
They'll catch us right away.

353
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,807
No, they won't.

354
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,028
We'll let you go this time.

355
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,288
You will?

356
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:44,760
Yes.

357
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,699
Thank you!

358
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,069
Take this.

359
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:53,741
What is it?

360
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,440
Something I found in your heart.

361
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,393
We're safe.

362
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,961
I told you!

363
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,672
What did that clown give you?

364
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,548
Eggs?

365
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,076
He's a god!

366
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:38,884
A god?

367
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,417
He saw my whole heart!

368
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,389
That clown's a god!

369
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,243
Oh, no! That's father's car.

370
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,398
Mother!

371
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,201
Did you have fun?

372
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:35,911
Yes.

373
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:38,839
Where's father?

374
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,981
He'll be late tonight.

375
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,355
I'm sorry we're late.

376
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:51,124
Sota, this is for you and your grandpa.

377
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,690
Thank you!

378
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,042
Grandpa, it's time to eat.

379
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,077
Thank you!

380
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,084
White rice... it's glittering!

381
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:23,623
How did you?

382
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:24,861
A gift.

383
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,527
From who?

384
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,129
Sayo's mother. It's for you.

385
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:34,368
Well! Isn't that nice.

386
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,263
I accept with thanks.

387
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:38,769
With thanks!

388
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,147
You got eggs, too?

389
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:48,345
Yeah.

390
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:52,516
Let's eat!

391
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,612
Ah, that's good!

392
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,976
We owe this to Mr. Arima.

393
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,716
I'm only able to live here...

394
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:33,026
because I can work for his place.

395
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:38,796
Sota, never forget the feeling of gratitude.

396
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,342
And...

397
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,912
never lie.

398
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,221
No matter how small a lie,

399
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,484
one day you'll be found out.

400
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:09,865
And then people will feel hurt.

401
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,599
That's a sad thing.

402
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:52,604
I didn't tell a lie. I was given the eggs.

403
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:55,776
Not by a man from the circus,

404
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,710
but by a god.

405
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,364
Minori!

406
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:20,294
Yes?

407
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:31,577
What?

408
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,183
Thank you.

409
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:35,643
For what?

410
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,618
Giving us a ride.

411
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,947
That was great!

412
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,289
How's Sota?

413
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:48,060
I heard something he'll really like.

414
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,761
What?

415
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:52,295
Shoji...

416
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,070
A pond with a legend.

417
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:56,870
A pond?

418
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,971
Blue, shining, and round.

419
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,167
Bottomless.

420
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,403
Why will Sota like that?

421
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:07,006
The earth there makes paint

422
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,774
With fantastic colors.

423
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:10,718
Different from other paint.

424
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,251
'Night-Sky'.

425
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,215
'Night-Sky'?

426
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,792
What color is 'Night-Sky'?

427
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,563
The color of the sky at night,

428
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,026
I guess.

429
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,868
That's just black, stupid!

430
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,498
Oh.

431
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:31,831
Why'd you invite me?

432
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,473
We're friends.

433
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,541
Friends, huh...

434
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:37,002
Shoji, are you sure this is the way?

435
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,682
Yeah, it's a short-cut.

436
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,185
But if a train comes...

437
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,153
Chicken!

438
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:19,847
Well?

439
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:24,316
We keep going, of course.

440
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,549
But...

441
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,955
How else do we reach the pond?

442
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,338
We should go back.

443
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,007
I've got a bad feeling...

444
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,205
Are we nearly there?

445
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:53,871
Maybe.

446
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,643
I'll go alone.

447
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,555
We've all come this far...

448
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,078
What's wrong, Chibi?

449
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:36,451
Run!

450
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:03,917
Hurry! Hurry!

451
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,577
Quick! Quick!

452
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:19,725
You OK?

453
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:52,501
Where were you?!

454
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,832
Sayo! What happened?

455
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,407
Mother!

456
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,577
Get her a bath.

457
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:13,611
Where were you?

458
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,122
We were going to Round Pond...

459
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:17,590
Round Pond?

460
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,490
You took Sayo to such a dangerous place?!

461
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:24,524
Was it her idea?

462
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,192
It was mine.

463
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:29,462
I'm sorry!

464
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,405
I see.

465
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:22,422
Where's Sayo?

466
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,823
Asleep. She's very tired.

467
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,900
The boys asked Sota to come with them.

468
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,603
Did you forgive him?

469
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,240
So he took the blame...

470
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,521
Kiyo, keep Sayo away from him.

471
00:59:55,692 --> 01:00:00,095
Haven't you been hard on them lately?

472
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,422
He's trouble.

473
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,043
That'll be him.

474
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:51,871
Coming!

475
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:04,360
Please...

476
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:06,987
Thank you.

477
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:22,175
So it was your father

478
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,612
Who wrote this manuscript?

479
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:26,772
Yes.

480
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:32,350
He died more than ten years ago.

481
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,616
I found it recently sorting out his things.

482
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,256
I glanced through it...

483
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,997
and remembered things

484
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,564
he talked about when I was young.

485
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:51,531
Then I realized the story written there was true.

486
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:58,572
Does your father appear in that story?

487
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:04,319
Yes. My father was a clown in a circus.

488
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,223
'So many eras have been,

489
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,060
and always brown war.

490
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,026
'So many eras have been,

491
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,569
and always the blizzards of winter.

492
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,043
'So many eras have been;

493
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,413
the one here tonight, in its prime.

494
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,717
'The one here tonight, in its prime.

495
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,617
'The high top of the circus tent.

496
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,788
A lone trapeze.

497
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,255
'A trapeze you can barely see.

498
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,629
'Upside-down, arms hanging.

499
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:53,225
The dirty cotton canopy.

500
01:02:54,771 --> 01:03:00,801
'Hyuu, hyaa, hyuu-hyaa... '

501
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,338
Look who's here!

502
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,712
Did you write that?

503
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:14,423
No. It's by a poet named Chuya Nakahara.

504
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:15,621
'Poet'?

505
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,887
Someone who finds the words.

506
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:37,670
Did you draw this?

507
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:39,812
To thank you for the eggs.

508
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:41,778
It got wrinkled, though.

509
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:45,885
Thank you!

510
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:52,057
My father joined the circus as a boy

511
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,361
and traveled the whole country.

512
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:59,193
In one village he met a girl...

513
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,834
and a boy was born.

514
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,663
But my father left the village

515
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:08,642
and returned to the circus.

516
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,407
Are you that boy?

517
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:15,408
No.

518
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:19,411
That boy was named Sota.

519
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:25,458
So that clown was Sota's father?

520
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,025
Yes.

521
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:33,624
But he was your father, too...

522
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:39,440
He met another woman,

523
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,101
married her, and I was born.

524
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:50,380
So you and Sota are half brothers?

525
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:52,547
Yes.

526
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,351
I've never met him,

527
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,726
but he's my elder brother.

528
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:05,659
After ten years, my father went back

529
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:09,236
to the village and met Sota.

530
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,581
There. You'd never know
I was the clown, would you.

531
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:27,584
Yes, I would.

532
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:28,681
Why?

533
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:30,352
Your voice.

534
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,753
I See.

535
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,840
Your face is filthy.

536
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,073
You wipe it.

537
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,174
It's cold.

538
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,018
Stand up.

539
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,961
Wear that.

540
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,758
You're a god.

541
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:13,329
Me?

542
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,901
You looked into my heart.

543
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,869
I still can. You love that girl.

544
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,570
You want to marry her.

545
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:25,472
No!

546
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,749
Your face says so.

547
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,614
What I'm thinking now is that

548
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,785
I want to be an artist.

549
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,390
Well, this is really good.

550
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:44,232
I wanted to do it in 'night-sky' paint.

551
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,869
A legend says you get it

552
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,867
from the mud by 'Round Pond.'

553
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,072
'Round Pond'?

554
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,036
Yeah.

555
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:55,233
With that color,

556
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,275
it Would've been even better.

557
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:00,506
Is it impossible to get it?

558
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:05,413
The way there is too dangerous.

559
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:08,854
Let's go together.

560
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:44,320
There?

561
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,022
Let's go.

562
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,172
Wow!

563
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:04,709
Let's look.

564
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,372
Sota, is this it?

565
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,645
It's really true!

566
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:52,786
'Night-Sky'... the legendary color

567
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:54,562
my friends told me about!

568
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,963
Now I can do your portrait again.

569
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:02,637
I'm happy with the one I have.

570
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,006
So what'll I paint?

571
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,105
Something you really want to.

572
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:15,408
Will I find that if I look for it?

573
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:16,980
Sure.

574
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:19,845
Never give up.

575
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,350
Find what you love most, and

576
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:25,721
feel that in your heart as you paint.

577
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:26,791
I'll try.

578
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:18,178
Thank you very much.

579
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,648
Goodbye.

580
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,474
Take care.

581
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:31,125
Can I come back and visit you again?

582
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:16,333
I'm back!

583
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,132
Grandpa!

584
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:20,672
Grandpa!

585
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:29,941
Oh, Sota...

586
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,017
I'll get help!

587
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:37,749
Don't worry. I tripped, that's all.

588
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,262
Get my stick for me.

589
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:50,327
Thanks.

590
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:06,954
Take this bell and put it on Chibi.

591
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:07,884
Can I?

592
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,258
Yeah. It doesn't look like

593
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,259
I'll be going out for a while.

594
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:25,831
Look after things. Will you?

595
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,838
Sota's mother seems to have died

596
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,949
Soon after she had him.

597
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,117
His grandfather took him in.

598
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,125
He was poor,

599
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:51,257
but he made sure his grandson was raised properly.

600
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,088
Are you eating right?

601
01:13:58,667 --> 01:13:59,156
Yes.

602
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,932
Come to me if there's trouble, all right?

603
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,236
Thank you.

604
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:24,811
You're hungry too, huh?

605
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:34,679
But I want to use this money for paper.

606
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,784
I want good paper.

607
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:51,836
God said that I should feel it in my heart as I paint.

608
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,188
Keep quiet, OK?

609
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:00,768
OK, let's go.

610
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,578
Now I feel like I can paint.

611
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,255
You really must see Sota?

612
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:26,452
This is a present for Sota from me.

613
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:34,795
Be back by the time your father gets home.

614
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,664
Mother... thank you!

615
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:46,472
Sayo, do you know why winter is cold?

616
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:54,316
The gods made winter so we wouldn't

617
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,249
forget each other's warmth.

618
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:02,187
Now off you go.

619
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,847
This is from Mother.

620
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:31,717
Let's go.

621
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,993
Where?

622
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,819
Follow me.

623
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:46,559
Stand!

624
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:47,960
Bow!

625
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:50,631
Sit!

626
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,301
I will now call the roll. Harada, Sota.

627
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:56,510
Present.

628
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,344
Harada, Chibi...

629
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:05,547
Harada, Chibi...

630
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,112
Say 'present'.

631
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,030
That's a piano.

632
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,040
It's all shiny!

633
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:38,450
Shall I play?

634
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:39,578
Sure!

635
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,023
What's wrong, Chibi?

636
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,656
Someone's coming!

637
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:35,292
The janitor! What'll we do?

638
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:41,700
Go out here.

639
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:43,002
Go!

640
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:54,317
Chibi!

641
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,233
Come on.

642
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:36,221
The police called this morning.

643
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:42,261
That kid sneaked into the school.

644
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:47,903
What happened?

645
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:49,608
I spoke for him.

646
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:53,111
He broke an expensive

647
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:57,374
Specimen in the lab on his way out.

648
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,746
I had to pay for it.

649
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:08,418
If you play piano there,

650
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:10,855
everyone knows!

651
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,731
I let her go.

652
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,171
Don't let her see him.

653
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:25,276
Sayo...

654
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:27,977
Understood?

655
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:32,414
Sayo!

656
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,158
You want them together?

657
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:51,996
I think they should be free to choose.

658
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:58,436
I simply want things to follow their own course.

659
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:06,486
One day, we will find a fiance for Sayo.

660
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,755
They will eventually be separated.

661
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,725
That's best done now.

662
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:46,026
It doesn't look like Mr. Arima

663
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,558
Will forget this for a while.

664
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:57,634
There's something I want to tell you.

665
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:02,468
Your mother...

666
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:08,374
died giving birth to you.

667
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:13,752
She left her life to you.

668
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:21,385
So you have to live her life as well as yours.

669
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:29,865
Sota, whatever happens...

670
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:33,166
you mustn't hate people,

671
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,974
or hold grudges against them.

672
01:28:56,264 --> 01:28:59,756
Give my regards to your daughter, then.

673
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:03,436
Today has been a fine day!

674
01:29:03,771 --> 01:29:06,604
And for me as well.

675
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:10,240
Make the Arima Company grow.

676
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:13,537
That will benefit us both.

677
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:14,679
Thank you very much!

678
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:41,425
Good morning, Chibi.

679
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:06,851
Good morning, Grandpa.

680
01:31:15,536 --> 01:31:16,503
Grandpa?

681
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:20,470
Grandpa?

682
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,377
Grandpa!

683
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:28,045
Grandpa!

684
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:10,043
O God...

685
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:15,087
Why does everyone go away?

686
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:28,899
'The circus tent, gone like a phantom.

687
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:34,306
'The site on which it had stood

688
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:38,807
Was smaller than Sota remembered.'

689
01:33:51,425 --> 01:33:53,052
It ends here.

690
01:34:00,401 --> 01:34:04,633
My father regretted that he'd abandoned Sota.

691
01:34:05,673 --> 01:34:10,372
But he didn't want him pulled into

692
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,909
a circus life, never settling down.

693
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:16,380
As I read this...

694
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:19,777
...I found myself wanting to know

695
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,953
What happened afterwards?

696
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:27,626
The village office there told me

697
01:34:27,862 --> 01:34:29,193
your father's company failed...

698
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:32,159
after the war.

699
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,668
My father kept it a secret,

700
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,803
but his company was in trouble.

701
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:46,102
Things weren't well.

702
01:34:46,847 --> 01:34:48,246
So my father...

703
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,378
was secretly hoping to marry me off

704
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:56,454
to some businessman's son.

705
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:00,249
So he kept you away from Sota?

706
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:07,567
Please tell me the rest of the story.

707
01:35:12,006 --> 01:35:16,033
There was a bad blizzard that day.

708
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:17,972
Not like this.

709
01:35:19,246 --> 01:35:21,214
A vicious storm.

710
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:27,814
Sota had nowhere he belonged any more.

711
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:34,452
All that I think he had on his mind...

712
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:37,858
Was to give me that painting.

713
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:46,657
Good evening.

714
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:51,871
I'm sorry about your grandpa.

715
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:02,714
Give this to Sayo, please.

716
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:05,879
It's a picture I painted.

717
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:15,025
You give it to her.

718
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,659
Good night.

719
01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:27,870
Sota?

720
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:30,438
Sota!

721
01:37:33,914 --> 01:37:34,778
You'll be all right?

722
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:03,934
Who was it?

723
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:07,971
Just a salesman.

724
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:20,827
You're flipping cards.

725
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:23,387
Let's play a card game.

726
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:26,155
That's what men do.

727
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:19,880
Grandpa, as you said...

728
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:23,150
I don't hate anyone,

729
01:39:24,591 --> 01:39:25,888
or hold any grudge.

730
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:30,389
That's what you wanted, right?

731
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:58,149
Stay there.

732
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:10,767
Fire! Fire!

733
01:41:11,465 --> 01:41:12,329
Kiyo!

734
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:31,942
Sayo...

735
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:44,561
Was Sota here?

736
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:53,364
'Night-sky'! He went to the pond!

737
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,068
We're all friends, we said.

738
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,403
You sent him away!

739
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:17,089
Sir! There's a fire!

740
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:18,524
Where?

741
01:42:19,233 --> 01:42:21,497
The warehouse!

742
01:42:32,246 --> 01:42:33,270
How is it?!

743
01:42:34,448 --> 01:42:36,575
The inside's fine.

744
01:42:37,384 --> 01:42:39,011
A light shorted out.

745
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:40,514
It was good that we caught it in time.

746
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:41,413
I see.

747
01:42:42,856 --> 01:42:45,518
Who found it? I have to thank him.

748
01:42:45,759 --> 01:42:50,196
A boy with a dog. He left right away.

749
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:02,872
Sir!

750
01:43:04,244 --> 01:43:07,543
Get some people! Find him!

751
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:15,148
You there go that way.

752
01:43:15,422 --> 01:43:16,753
We'll go this way.

753
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:43,047
Sota!

754
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:02,233
Sota!

755
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:22,584
Sota!

756
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:24,884
Where is he?!

757
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:27,853
He's not dressed for this!

758
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:31,160
Mr. Arima's looking too, isn't he?

759
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:34,859
Ma'am! He's not at home.

760
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:38,663
Sayo, can you think of anywhere?

761
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:42,273
Um... Um...

762
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:51,544
Sota had gone to the place

763
01:44:51,818 --> 01:44:53,376
that remained in his heart.

764
01:44:55,989 --> 01:44:57,013
The place he'd found

765
01:44:57,791 --> 01:45:00,282
what he really wanted to paint.

766
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:17,138
Sota?

767
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:21,675
Chibi?

768
01:45:23,884 --> 01:45:24,873
Sota!

769
01:45:26,386 --> 01:45:28,047
Sota, wake up!

770
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:31,450
Sota, wake up!

771
01:45:32,225 --> 01:45:33,351
Sota!

772
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:35,559
Sota!

773
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:38,721
Sota, wake up!

774
01:45:39,533 --> 01:45:41,000
Sota, wake up!

775
01:45:42,402 --> 01:45:43,926
Sota!

776
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:46,869
Sota, wake up!

777
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:04,988
It was just as if he was quietly sleeping.

778
01:46:07,627 --> 01:46:09,356
Oh no.

779
01:46:10,931 --> 01:46:14,697
He was listening...

780
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:20,300
to the piano coming from the classroom.

781
01:46:22,909 --> 01:46:24,399
It was love.

782
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:30,612
I really loved Sota.

783
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,670
Sota!

784
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:25,434
Lt's all right...

785
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:29,172
...to keep the manuscript?

786
01:47:29,543 --> 01:47:30,475
Certainly.

787
01:47:31,678 --> 01:47:34,943
Thank you very much.

788
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:38,116
No, thank you.

789
01:47:39,386 --> 01:47:42,253
I'm glad I heard this.

790
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:46,219
I want to thank my grandmother, too.

791
01:47:48,662 --> 01:47:50,493
She went through hard times,

792
01:47:50,664 --> 01:47:53,030
but she didn't despair.

793
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:56,667
That's how I come to be alive now.

794
01:47:57,504 --> 01:47:59,472
So, thank you.
