1
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:18,752
- I don't know.

2
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:24,838
I don't know why.

3
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:39,261
I'm trying to clear my voice

4
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:48,677
so I can speak louder.

5
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,892
I need to shout.

6
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:00,581
I need to shout!

7
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,715
I need to fucking shout!

8
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:13,545
I'm sorry.

9
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:18,147
My language.

10
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,102
I'm sorry.

11
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,601
Do you forgive me?

12
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:34,477
Do you forgive me?

13
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:45,072
Do you forgive me?

14
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,412
- What would you do if we got pregnant?

15
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,295
- We?

16
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:39,250
- We.

17
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,109
- Did you study biology at that

18
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,557
private school you went to?

19
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,524
- You know what I mean.

20
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:52,051
- Would we keep it?

21
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,324
- Why wouldn't we keep it?

22
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,389
- I don't know.

23
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:32,227
I keep hearing poetry.

24
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,659
I hear poetry of all.

25
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,915
Keeping my mind at bay

26
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:41,622
and only on the shore.

27
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,592
I heard your voice.

28
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,392
I shouted out to you.

29
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,078
You never came.

30
00:07:56,082 --> 00:07:57,332
You never come.

31
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,060
You never come.

32
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,252
You never come.

33
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:20,983
- I am a political prisoner.

34
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,033
I'll get out early on good behaviour.

35
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:27,035
I am a political refugee.

36
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,207
I make my home with good behaviour.

37
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,177
I am a political slave.

38
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,802
I'll be freed when I am dead.

39
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,423
- That ain't nothing much.

40
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:44,448
Where's she at?

41
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:45,520
In the park?

42
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,370
- Yeah, we're going.

43
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:47,203
- Yeah, yeah.

44
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,133
- You want to take some people.

45
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:50,427
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, get
the boys down there.

46
00:08:50,477 --> 00:08:52,016
Get a few cans and stuff like that.

47
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,708
- Well, it is your birthday.
- Well, yeah exactly.

48
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,222
Yeah, you need to party.

49
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:57,936
- Bring it in right, you know.

50
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:00,437
Hey, I didn't know you were
coming today, Stall mate.

51
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:01,883
- Dog it, did I?

52
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:03,872
- Hey, it's my birthday.

53
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:05,301
- Happy birthday.

54
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:06,533
- Cheers.

55
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,931
Do you like my outfit?

56
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,944
- Yeah, real dapper.

57
00:09:08,994 --> 00:09:10,651
- Yeah, I got it at discount.

58
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:11,567
One hundred percent, mate.

59
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,979
Oh yeah, how'd you manage that?

60
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,904
- The riots, mate.

61
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:16,763
You went rioting?

62
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:17,587
- Well, yeah.

63
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,859
Well, didn't you?

64
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,080
No.

65
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,593
- Mate, you missed that.

66
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:22,676
Some proper bargains.

67
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,384
Got my mum a fur coat.

68
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:25,243
- Now, where's she gonna wear that?

69
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,067
Out the door.

70
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,903
- Now, I hear you're
living in a mansion, huh.

71
00:09:28,953 --> 00:09:30,139
Not me.

72
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,013
- Well, that's what they says.

73
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,949
They lied.

74
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:34,789
- It just all made sense because

75
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,133
I haven't seen you on TV boxing

76
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:39,762
and that, so you know know it makes sense.

77
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,490
I don't box anymore.

78
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,951
- Oh yeah, they said that too.

79
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,399
Then why would you see me
on TV boxing?

80
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:46,348
- Just thought you might.

81
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:47,389
You know.

82
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:48,733
You should, Stall mate.

83
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:50,354
You're a fucking legend.

84
00:09:50,404 --> 00:09:51,778
The unbeaten Stallion in all that.

85
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:54,245
- Pencil, lad, why are you...

86
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:56,434
It's a beautiful day.

87
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:59,143
Why are you here sucking my dick?

88
00:09:59,193 --> 00:10:00,669
- What?

89
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,892
- What do you want?

90
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:04,332
- Well, I just wanted to say hi.

91
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:05,944
- Mate, it seems like you
said everything but hi

92
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:09,558
since you've opened your fucking mouth.

93
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,118
- Hi, Stally?

94
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:12,251
- Hi, Pencil.

95
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:14,842
Now, do one, mate.

96
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:20,345
- Stall mate, Stall.

97
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:21,978
- What do you want?

98
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:26,607
- George is pissed, mate.

99
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:27,490
- So?

100
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:31,105
- He's pissed at Chris.

101
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:32,251
- George is always pissed at something.

102
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:35,225
- No I know, but this is serious.

103
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,745
He's talking about doing him.

104
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:38,628
- Why?

105
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,698
- Some deal went well rank

106
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:43,151
like money or drugs or something.

107
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,701
I don't know but it's serious.

108
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,591
- Thanks for the info.

109
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,808
- Now, do one again, mate.

110
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,308
- Stall?

111
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:58,255
Have you got a Century, mate?

112
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,021
- Do one, Pencil.

113
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:02,366
- Well now, come on.
It's my birthday.

114
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,563
What...

115
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,196
What about a score?

116
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:08,329
A pony even?

117
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,517
He lives in a mansion

118
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,350
and can't even give his mate

119
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,243
a bit of financial aid.

120
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:21,666
- Mom.

121
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,151
Oh, Stally!

122
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:27,927
How have you been?
- Been good, how are you?

123
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,762
- Chris is in his room.

124
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:32,512
Maybe you can talk some since into him.

125
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,058
He needs a job.

126
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:36,125
Also, you can have a word with her.

127
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:37,552
She's a bloody mess too.

128
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:41,220
- I'm sure Chris will sort
himself out anyway, mom.

129
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,233
- I love it when you call me mom.

130
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:44,116
Come here.

131
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,067
I've missed this so much.

132
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:47,807
- Me too.
- Go on.

133
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:48,803
Go to see, Chris.

134
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:49,983
- Alright.

135
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:51,825
And what's this one doing?

136
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,574
- She does not clean this bloody place.

137
00:11:54,624 --> 00:11:56,241
She'd rather go out with her mates,

138
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,244
her little twat mates
from around the block.

139
00:11:58,294 --> 00:11:59,955
- Mom, I cleaned yesterday.

140
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:01,493
- FFS.

141
00:12:01,543 --> 00:12:03,462
- FFS, you know.

142
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:05,091
- Go take a piss.

143
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,628
- Don't talk to him like that.

144
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:07,755
Who do you think you are?

145
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:09,242
- I can talk to anyone how I'd like.

146
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:10,066
- Oh really?

147
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:11,006
- Yeah I can.

148
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:12,745
- You think you can do anything, do you?

149
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,091
- Yeah, I can actually, just like Chris.

150
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,602
- Mom.

151
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,890
Mom.

152
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,357
Mom, leave it.

153
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,638
Mom, she'll do it herself.

154
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:21,521
Leave it.

155
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,039
- Oy.

156
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:24,980
What?

157
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,663
- Oy.
- What?

158
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:27,505
- When fucking mom talks to you,

159
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,514
you fucking listen, alright?

160
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,553
Fuck off, Chris.

161
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:31,475
Fucking what?

162
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:32,308
Yeah, fuck off.

163
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:33,141
Who the fuck are you talking to?

164
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:34,848
You talk that
shit to mom all the time.

165
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:35,909
Yes, but I'm the fucking daddy

166
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:36,768
in this fucking house.

167
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:37,723
I'm the man here.

168
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:38,582
Oh shut up.

169
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:39,415
What the fuck?

170
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,248
You're bringing boys here.

171
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:41,081
I fucking here you
shagging them all the time.

172
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,654
I'm trying to fucking relax in here.

173
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:44,890
Who the fuck are you talking to?

174
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:45,723
I'm not the only one

175
00:12:45,747 --> 00:12:47,004
who talks shit around here, okay?

176
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,565
You're talking to mom like shit.

177
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:49,856
I've fucking had enough of you.

178
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:52,470
For fuck's sakes.

179
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,430
What?

180
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,280
- Nothing, mate.

181
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:05,387
- Nothing?

182
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:07,830
Don't fucking shake your head
in my fucking house, mate.

183
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,988
I'm the fucking daddy in this house.

184
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,765
I do the daddy shit.

185
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:11,735
- Hitting women?

186
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:13,293
- It's my fucking sister.

187
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,143
- Alright, mate.

188
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,009
Whatever.

189
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:28,093
- You like my sneaks?

190
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:29,137
- Yeah they're not bad, mate.

191
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:30,850
- Got a 100 % discount on those.

192
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,858
- You went rioting.

193
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,245
- Damn right, I did.

194
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:34,386
- Wow.

195
00:13:34,436 --> 00:13:35,570
- So, mate.

196
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,420
It's 500...

197
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,253
- Mate, mate, mate.

198
00:13:38,303 --> 00:13:39,810
I'm not in all this no more, mate.

199
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,962
- Oh yeah.

200
00:13:41,012 --> 00:13:43,085
You left all this slum
life behind, ain't ya.

201
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:44,423
You ain't none of us no more, are you?

202
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:47,058
- You ask me questions you
already know the answer to.

203
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,138
I don't box.
I don't deal.

204
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:52,018
I don't run like a little girl
when the 5-0's on the block.

205
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:53,757
Fucking hell.

206
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:56,179
I'm all grown up now, Peter Pan.

207
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:58,791
- Alright, Tinkerbell.
Fucking hell.

208
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,674
Calm down.

209
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,445
- Look.

210
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,317
I've just came here out of courtesy.

211
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:07,373
- Courtesy, aye?

212
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,223
- Yeah, mate.

213
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:10,039
- You're being courteous right now?

214
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,172
- Yeah, I'm telling you to your face.

215
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,236
Look, I thought I'd tell you to your face

216
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,927
that I'm away from all this.

217
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:19,271
- You shouldn't have bothered, mate.

218
00:14:19,295 --> 00:14:20,429
- You need to get away too.

219
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,461
- Just send a text, you know what I mean?

220
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:23,551
I was talking to Pencil.

221
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:24,377
- Oh, that clown.

222
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,692
- He was telling me you're
in large with George.

223
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,079
- Oh, fuck George and fuck Pencil.

224
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,993
- Fuck George?
What do you mean "Fuck George"?

225
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,650
- Fuck him.
I mean fuck him.

226
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:31,483
- Seriously?

227
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:32,316
- Fuck him.

228
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,391
- George is not someone you fuck with.

229
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,858
- Yeah, fuck him.

230
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,001
What are you doing now.

231
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,358
- Nothing, mate.

232
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:48,341
Got a job, got a girl.

233
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,200
- No, you fucking nut.

234
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:50,033
Not your fucking life story.

235
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,307
Like right now.

236
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,669
- Talk to a funking wanker.

237
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,469
- Come with me, come.

238
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,319
- What?

239
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,152
- Come with me.

240
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:59,018
Dickhead.

241
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:09,957
Okay.

242
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,317
That's a lot of game.

243
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,189
- Damn right it is.

244
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,752
- Please tell me this ain't George's.

245
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,288
- Made a coupe of bob on that.

246
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,203
Wow.

247
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,491
You're mad.

248
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,341
- You love it.

249
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:21,254
- You're actually mad.

250
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,220
I go away for a couple of months,

251
00:15:22,244 --> 00:15:23,609
and you've got up to this.

252
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,399
- You fucking love it, mate.

253
00:15:26,502 --> 00:15:27,311
You're crazy.

254
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:28,144
- You fucking love it.

255
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:29,747
- You are crazy, you know that.

256
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:31,217
You're fucking crazy.

257
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,331
Fucking hell.

258
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:33,696
Come on, let's
have fucking tickle.

259
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,520
What?

260
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:35,875
No, no, no, no, no, no.

261
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:36,725
What are you doing?

262
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:37,558
What are you doing?

263
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:38,400
- What do you fucking think I'm doing?

264
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:39,224
Look.

265
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:40,057
Have a bit.

266
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,732
- No, I'm not having it. I'm not involved.
- On the house.

267
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:42,556
- I'm not involved.

268
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:43,398
- On the house.
- On the house.

269
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:44,335
You're already in enough shit.

270
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,168
Fucking leave it alone.

271
00:15:45,192 --> 00:15:46,001
No, behave.

272
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,658
- Leave it alone, leave it alone.
- For fuck's sake.

273
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,108
- Leave it alone.

274
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,804
I can't believe you stole...

275
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,025
- I know.

276
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,261
- What I'm trying to say is...

277
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,094
What I'm trying to say is...

278
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:56,901
What you're trying to say is...

279
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,707
- Fucking listen for once in your life.

280
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:02,978
- Fucking Badge, the Greek philosopher.

281
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,247
Yoga's in the ass, come on here.

282
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,877
- Alright let him speak.

283
00:16:06,927 --> 00:16:08,269
- You robbed the old man.

284
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:09,128
Now the old man's gonna do

285
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:11,139
what old men do, get bitter, get angry

286
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:12,274
and join our fucking removes.

287
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:14,094
- Oh is that what old men do?

288
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:15,789
I thought they did the opposite actually.

289
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,648
I thought they got old,

290
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:17,608
got weak and fuck...

291
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:18,467
- You think this is all a joke,

292
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,843
you think this is a fucking joke.

293
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:21,965
- Your mate is about six feet deep.

294
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,832
Balls expunged from our body.

295
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:24,936
- Come on, Badge.

296
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:25,786
Just give it a rest.

297
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,347
He can just give the gear back.

298
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:28,280
- What gear?

299
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,725
He just sold half of
it for half the price.

300
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,649
- For half the fucking price.

301
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:36,190
You gonna say anything.

302
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,907
- About what?

303
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:39,587
- Fucking lost cause, mate.

304
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:40,437
- You now, fuck.

305
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,832
He's pissed me off, I've got him back.

306
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,355
We're square.

307
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:44,205
- This guy.

308
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:45,602
Are you fucking listening to this guy?

309
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:47,265
- George don't do square.

310
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:48,517
He also don't do people blatantly

311
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,347
shafting him up the rear
and boasting about it.

312
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:51,171
- Boasting?

313
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:52,004
Fuck off, boasting.

314
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:53,339
- Guess what he does
at Wax's the other day?

315
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:55,148
He goes up to this bird, goes,

316
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,432
"You know I'm the guy that robbed George."

317
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:58,113
Big fucking grin on his face,

318
00:16:58,163 --> 00:16:59,329
trying to impress this flag.

319
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:00,384
- It fucking worked though, didn't it?

320
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:02,070
- It fucking worked.

321
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,499
- It fucking worked on your sister.

322
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,974
- Smell, it's still fucking stinky.

323
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:08,059
- You're a fucking idiot, mate.
- You are.

324
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,751
Come on.
- My name's all over this shit too, you know.

325
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:10,575
Leave it.

326
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:11,408
Calm down.

327
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:12,406
- It's mine now.

328
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:13,782
- "Mine now"?

329
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,766
- Look if he cries about it,

330
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,083
I'll take the profits, give it all to him.

331
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,678
- They'll be no profits!

332
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,513
You sold the gear for half.

333
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,059
What part of that simple mathematical

334
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,013
equation don't you understand.

335
00:17:23,037 --> 00:17:24,827
- It's all profits, mate.

336
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,195
I didn't pay for it.

337
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,422
- He's going to kill you.

338
00:17:28,472 --> 00:17:30,838
- I'll talk to George.

339
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:31,825
I'll sort this out.

340
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:32,675
He'll listen to me.

341
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:33,707
- I don't need you fighting my battles.

342
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:35,073
- You need a coffin, mate.

343
00:17:35,123 --> 00:17:36,513
- Badge.

344
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,409
Give it a rest.

345
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,745
- He shouldn't bumped me from that fight.

346
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,809
All I wanted was that
chance, that one fight.

347
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,099
I could've beaten him.

348
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:43,953
- Who?

349
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:46,098
- Missile.
Me versus Missile, mate.

350
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,025
Title fight.

351
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:48,998
I have my right to
fight and I worked hard.

352
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,107
I beat the piece of shit wankers

353
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:51,510
he put in front of me,

354
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,446
and could barely stand
up straight in a ring.

355
00:17:53,496 --> 00:17:54,998
But I did my time.

356
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,121
I beat them one by fucking one.

357
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:58,091
He just wanted me on the leash,

358
00:17:58,115 --> 00:17:59,419
like the one he had on you.

359
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,057
But I can't be leashed.

360
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:02,038
I'm a demon.

361
00:18:02,088 --> 00:18:03,509
I'm a winner.

362
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,785
- He's gonna kill you.

363
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,918
He really is.

364
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,057
- So be it then, mate.

365
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:13,940
So be it.

366
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,192
At least I'll be free of this shit.

367
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,367
- There is this squire.

368
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,834
I know who he is.

369
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
You feel it.

370
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,083
Hear the trimmings on the ground.

371
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:27,983
Just squire.

372
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:32,331
I know it is the squire.

373
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,650
I can smell it even.

374
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:39,548
It makes me uncomfortable.

375
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,460
I never asked my dad for nothing.

376
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:52,757
Not even solitary shilling, never once.

377
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:00,143
I was proud little turd.

378
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,271
- No one's ever beaten me.

379
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,279
That means something to me.

380
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:11,372
I don't even fight anymore.

381
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:13,339
But it means something.

382
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:22,540
- To live is the rarest
thing in the world.

383
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,588
Most people exist.

384
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:25,555
That's all.

385
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,628
Oscar fucking Wilde.

386
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,092
- What does that mean, George?

387
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:32,975
- Riots.

388
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:34,719
Pointless.

389
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:38,479
The few always beat the many.

390
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:44,727
Aggression is such a
primitive human response.

391
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:49,655
More powerful is that of

392
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,112
silence and stillness.

393
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:01,039
That's the sign of a true man.

394
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,327
Adversity

395
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,713
followed by restraint.

396
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,337
- Maybe,

397
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:17,838
if you give him a bit more time,

398
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,471
he can pay it back.

399
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:26,912
- The reason

400
00:21:28,238 --> 00:21:29,988
the few beat the many

401
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,014
is the many are typically

402
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:35,897
stumbling.

403
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:37,992
The few

404
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:40,386
are elite.

405
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:44,008
That's why there's so few.

406
00:21:46,462 --> 00:21:47,629
Life, my dear,

407
00:21:49,227 --> 00:21:50,060
is simple.

408
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:52,762
One goes down,

409
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,806
another makes money.

410
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,970
One does right,

411
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,103
happy ending.

412
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:03,824
Exit own this.

413
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:10,197
- Chris.

414
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:17,961
Can't lose.

415
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:20,748
I just can't.

416
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:26,745
- Of course,

417
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:29,795
the Hindus believe in reincarnation.

418
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,102
But if you come back as yourself?

419
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,286
- Hi, madam.

420
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,119
My name's Daniel.

421
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,295
I work for Natural Gas.

422
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,669
I'd love to talk to you about
your current gas provider.

423
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,869
- Gas?

424
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:15,719
- Yes, madam.

425
00:23:15,752 --> 00:23:16,561
I'd love to come in and talk to you about

426
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:17,962
how we can benefit you.

427
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:19,654
- Okay.
You want to come through.

428
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,711
- Yeah, sure, thank you.

429
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:22,606
- It's something with those riots.

430
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,713
It's terrible, isn't it?

431
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:25,875
They shouldn't have shot that black guy.

432
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:27,649
That's police racism.

433
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,345
- Well, if he was a criminal,

434
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:31,195
then maybe...

435
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:33,652
Oh that's awful.

436
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:34,975
- A little bit.

437
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:37,358
- Any trouble down your way?

438
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,607
- No.

439
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:42,975
- Oh, nothing here either.

440
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,169
I was watching the TV earlier.

441
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:45,002
It's the mainly the whites

442
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,799
that are causing all of the problems.

443
00:23:47,682 --> 00:23:49,477
The world's gone mad.

444
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:50,489
- So, I'd really like to show you

445
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,991
what our policies are and
how we can save you money.

446
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,271
Let me show you on the tablet.

447
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,625
- What's that?

448
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,615
- It's our policies,
our savings and many...

449
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,455
For what?

450
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:00,784
- For the gas we provide, madam.

451
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:01,737
I told you earlier.

452
00:24:01,787 --> 00:24:03,748
- Oh, I thought it was the telephone.

453
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:04,985
- Oh, no.
- I'm so sorry.

454
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:06,461
- I did say gas earlier, madam.

455
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,320
- Oh I wasn't listening.

456
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:08,537
I'm so sorry.

457
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:10,447
I don't need gas.

458
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:11,844
- Everyone needs gas.

459
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:15,391
Mine is perfectly alright.

460
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:17,108
- You should still look at our policies.

461
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:21,407
- I'll look but I won't
be going with you guys.

462
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:22,266
- No problem.
- I'm sorry.

463
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,545
Oh no, don't put it away.

464
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,395
I mean, I'll look.

465
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:25,476
- There's no point.

466
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:27,139
- But don't put it away
because I might be swayed.

467
00:24:27,163 --> 00:24:29,246
- Do you think so, madam?

468
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:32,831
- Not really, actually.

469
00:24:32,881 --> 00:24:33,714
Sorry.

470
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:36,232
- I'm gonna go.

471
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:39,087
Well done.

472
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:40,281
- Well done?

473
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,831
- For not rioting.

474
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,359
- I have no need to, madam.

475
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,209
I have a job.

476
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:47,407
- Just well done.

477
00:24:47,457 --> 00:24:49,263
- This country needs more young men

478
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:50,708
like you.

479
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:51,758
- Thank you.

480
00:24:52,678 --> 00:24:54,845
- Okay, I'll show you out.

481
00:25:52,381 --> 00:25:54,001
- Do you enjoy your job?

482
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,216
Yup.

483
00:25:55,266 --> 00:25:57,504
I'm serious.

484
00:25:57,554 --> 00:25:59,344
It's alright.

485
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,194
Do you wish
you were back in the ring.

486
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:02,635
Nope.

487
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:09,225
- I'm asking you serious
questions here, come on.

488
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
- What do you want me to say?

489
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:13,966
I hate my job and I'd rather go back to

490
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:16,148
beating the crap out of humans.

491
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:19,439
If that's how you feel, yes.

492
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:21,572
All I'm asking is for
you to be honest with me.

493
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:22,422
- Honest?

494
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,493
You're starting to sound like
a Charlotte Bronte novel.

495
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,555
I'm gonna stop calling you mermaid

496
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:28,321
and call you Charlotte.

497
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,628
- Charlotte Bronte?

498
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:32,511
Magnificent reference.

499
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:35,462
Did they teach you that when
you were in public school?

500
00:26:35,486 --> 00:26:36,819
- Unfortunately.

501
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:38,875
Torture.

502
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:41,246
- Yeah okay, I hated it too.

503
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:42,736
- Really?

504
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:44,227
So why do you sound like one

505
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:46,360
every time we speak then?

506
00:26:48,712 --> 00:26:49,629
- Your mum.

507
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,751
- I see you.

508
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:01,547
I'm serious.

509
00:27:01,597 --> 00:27:03,994
Do you enjoy your job?

510
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:06,370
Who enjoys their job?

511
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,253
It pays.

512
00:27:09,682 --> 00:27:13,849
- You could always come
work with me if you wanted.

513
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:18,772
- Arrange weddings?

514
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:21,545
Sure.

515
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,312
Where do I sign?

516
00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:26,982
- I'm sorry sir, but the
position has just been filled.

517
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:29,245
We decided to go for someone in the

518
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:32,263
opposite end of the color spectrum.

519
00:27:32,313 --> 00:27:33,434
- Ah, fresh racism.

520
00:27:33,484 --> 00:27:34,484
My favourite.

521
00:27:36,232 --> 00:27:37,783
Yum.

522
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:38,994
Tasty.

523
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:43,391
- Dan, if you hate it,

524
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:44,274
quit.

525
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,986
- Life ain't that simple.

526
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:52,109
Commitment and loyalty is everything.

527
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,409
So is our rent.

528
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:57,022
- Life is that simple.

529
00:27:57,072 --> 00:28:00,395
We're given choices from birth.

530
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,445
I chose you.

531
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:05,606
It's our greatest weapon.

532
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:06,489
Choice.

533
00:28:22,155 --> 00:28:23,388
- You're right.

534
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:25,021
- I'm always right.

535
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:27,025
- Sometimes.

536
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:28,281
- No, I'm always right.

537
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,345
It's called being a woman.

538
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:30,202
- No.

539
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,583
I think I need to fight one last time.

540
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,216
- You think you do?

541
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,428
- No, it's a situation.

542
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:54,278
- Situation?

543
00:28:54,311 --> 00:28:55,443
Talk.

544
00:28:55,493 --> 00:28:56,293
- My mate, Chris.

545
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:58,637
He's a good guy.

546
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,062
- Yeah a real charming fellow.

547
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:00,995
- He is.

548
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:02,715
Maybe if you met him a couple more times.

549
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:04,213
- I have requested such an occasion

550
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:05,658
and you have yet to grant me this.

551
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:06,721
- We've been busy.

552
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:09,152
- Oh what, we embarrassed?

553
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:10,035
- Of what?

554
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:12,355
- Definitely not me.

555
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:14,041
I'm way too pretty.

556
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:17,293
I think maybe.

557
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:18,176
- No.

558
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:22,795
- Maybe he's like a window into your past,

559
00:29:23,747 --> 00:29:26,498
something you don't want me to view.

560
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:27,357
Maybe the view isn't...

561
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,423
Anyway.

562
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:30,282
He's got into some shit.

563
00:29:30,306 --> 00:29:33,681
- And you fighting is gonna
solve his life problems

564
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,467
and his mentality towards life.

565
00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:36,317
- No, but I...

566
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,103
- If so, then by all means, indulge.

567
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,909
- My old manager George,
he wants me to fight him and lose.

568
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:44,440
- Oh George, such proper geezers.

569
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,999
- Well, that's the long and short of it.

570
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:49,308
- And this solves the problem how?

571
00:29:49,358 --> 00:29:52,025
- If I lose, George makes money.

572
00:29:53,684 --> 00:29:55,322
- Are you sure?

573
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:57,264
Because it seems to me like George

574
00:29:57,288 --> 00:29:58,702
is trying to teach you a lesson

575
00:29:58,752 --> 00:30:01,919
in the face of Chris's transgressions.

576
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:04,075
- Maybe.

577
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,156
- By the way,

578
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,206
is this us discussing it

579
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:15,991
or are you telling me
this is gonna happen?

580
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,533
- Honestly,

581
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,512
both.

582
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:32,580
- You don't need to fight anymore.

583
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:12,907
I can't do it.

584
00:32:12,957 --> 00:32:13,790
- Do what?

585
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:15,603
- Fight you.

586
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:17,857
- You mean lose to me.

587
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:19,137
- Yeah.

588
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,790
- I might beat you, mate.

589
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,923
- It's unlikely.

590
00:32:22,973 --> 00:32:24,203
- Cocky for someone who
ain't even swung an arm

591
00:32:24,227 --> 00:32:25,310
in 18 months.

592
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:29,217
- No, I mean I ain't fighting you.

593
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,100
- Okay.

594
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:34,307
- Is that it?

595
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,173
Okay.

596
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,933
I mean, I'll fight you but I can't lose.

597
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,177
I just can't.

598
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,577
- What do you want me to do?

599
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:44,977
Oh please, Stally.

600
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:46,776
Please fight me and lose
so you can save my life.

601
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,283
Is that what you want?

602
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,683
- Yeah.

603
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:51,953
- Go fuck yourself.

604
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,857
- Mate.
I'm unbeaten.

605
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:55,990
It means something to me.

606
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:58,706
- I took three months for you.

607
00:32:58,756 --> 00:33:00,589
Don't you forget that.

608
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:30,336
- Did you know there are over
150 billion stars in the sky.

609
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,030
That's roughly the same amount of people

610
00:36:33,054 --> 00:36:34,721
who have ever lived.

611
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,487
- That means that one
day, we can all be a star.

612
00:36:40,537 --> 00:36:41,744
And a shooting star would be a star

613
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:44,351
that has excelled in this life.

614
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:47,933
Because a shooting star gets to see

615
00:36:47,983 --> 00:36:50,900
the whole entire universe in death.

616
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:55,439
I wanna be that star.

617
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:57,022
And that one.

618
00:36:57,072 --> 00:36:58,157
And that one.

619
00:36:58,207 --> 00:36:59,290
And that one.

620
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:05,131
You want to be all the stars.

621
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,264
- Every last one of them.

622
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:11,488
Don't you?

623
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:28,647
Is that it?

624
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:29,678
- What?

625
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,945
I'm not losing to you.

626
00:37:31,995 --> 00:37:33,638
- So now you're fighting?

627
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:36,164
But you're not losing.

628
00:37:36,214 --> 00:37:38,029
Or you're not fighting at all.

629
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,230
Make your mind up, son.

630
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,477
- You don't wanna fight?

631
00:37:40,527 --> 00:37:42,010
Argue?

632
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,205
Get your point across.

633
00:37:44,255 --> 00:37:47,468
This fight could save your life.

634
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,305
I'll save your life.

635
00:37:51,723 --> 00:37:52,556
What?

636
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:55,441
What's so fucking funny?

637
00:37:55,465 --> 00:37:57,450
- You are, mate.

638
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,583
Save my life.

639
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:01,204
Save your life, fuck you.

640
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:03,362
- If I don't fight you, he'll kill you.

641
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:04,637
- Don't then, mate.

642
00:38:04,687 --> 00:38:07,765
- Why are you so determined to fuck up?

643
00:38:07,815 --> 00:38:08,710
Did you piss George off

644
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:10,917
just to fuck my shit up?

645
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,621
Missed me so much,

646
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:14,021
you did some stupid shit to get me back

647
00:38:14,045 --> 00:38:15,331
in your fucked up life?

648
00:38:15,381 --> 00:38:17,244
- No I fucked up because I am a fuck up.

649
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,011
- Damn right, you are.

650
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:20,997
Your shit is fucking up my shit.

651
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:22,212
- Your shit?

652
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:23,095
What?

653
00:38:23,942 --> 00:38:26,370
Your perfect life in some swanky flat?

654
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,865
With your virgin white girl?

655
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:30,085
Your unbeaten record?

656
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:33,551
You're not Mike Tyson, mate.
This is amateur fucking boxing.

657
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:36,658
You only got that record because of me.

658
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:39,615
I took three months for you.

659
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:40,593
You should've been behind bars

660
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:41,758
when you're beating those dudes.

661
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:44,404
But instead you're beating
a six-month stretch

662
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:46,181
because of me.

663
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:47,031
- Leave it.

664
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:49,322
- No.
I took the rap.

665
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:51,713
I'm the fuck with a criminal record.

666
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:55,221
I'm the fucker who took
your fucking drug charges,

667
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:56,349
Mr. Fucking Unbeaten.

668
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,992
- Leave it.

669
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,542
- Do you know why?

670
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:02,764
Because George told me to.

671
00:39:02,814 --> 00:39:05,069
Because fucking George told me to.

672
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,559
You were the safer bet.

673
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:10,195
You'd make him more fucking money.

674
00:39:10,245 --> 00:39:12,073
The man sentences me to the slammer

675
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:15,516
so that you can make
him more fucking money.

676
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:18,078
I'm pretty sure there's some irony there.

677
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:21,128
- I thanked you over and over again.

678
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:26,968
I've been behind you over and over again.

679
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:31,607
Chris,

680
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:34,544
this time I can't.

681
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:40,049
I don't wanna die.

682
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:44,094
I don't want to die.

683
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:48,384
I only ever wanted to be someone.

684
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:50,267
I just wanted to be...

685
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,129
Just six rounds with me Stall, mate.

686
00:39:54,179 --> 00:39:55,512
Just six rounds.

687
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:00,682
- Alright.

688
00:40:05,158 --> 00:40:05,991
Alright.

689
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:18,028
Remember our first dance.

690
00:40:18,078 --> 00:40:19,277
It was to some hip-hop track.

691
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:21,564
You insisted we slam dance to it.

692
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:22,947
Yep.

693
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:26,054
It was you and I dancing.

694
00:40:26,104 --> 00:40:27,920
You and your
mermaid-like dress.

695
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,322
- Some heavy bass hip-hop track,

696
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:35,621
whilst everyone else was
freaking out on the dance floor.

697
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:37,598
- Freaking out?

698
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:39,387
Is that a term?

699
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,394
It is now.

700
00:40:41,444 --> 00:40:44,105
- That's never going to be a term.

701
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:45,722
- I remember thinking

702
00:40:45,772 --> 00:40:49,939
that this guy is the definition
of going against the grain.

703
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,460
I wanted to fuck you right there and then.

704
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:56,000
- It took you that long?

705
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,618
I kinda thought that when I first saw you.

706
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:58,442
- It makes sense.

707
00:40:58,475 --> 00:40:59,912
I'm incredibly hot.

708
00:40:59,962 --> 00:41:02,801
- I was thinking that about
most girls I saw that night.

709
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,241
You were the only one stupid
enough to dance with me.

710
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:07,988
- Well clearly, I'm incredibly hot

711
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:09,871
but incredibly stupid.

712
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:17,696
By fighting, you're
symbolically telling me

713
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:20,996
you're never gonna be detached from it.

714
00:41:22,177 --> 00:41:22,977
- It?

715
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,046
- It.

716
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:25,822
- Boxing.
- It.

717
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:28,760
- It's a bit more complex than that.

718
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,126
Someone's life's at stake.

719
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:31,976
What should I do?

720
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:33,755
Let him get taken out?

721
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,761
Let him suffer?

722
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:36,644
- Yes.

723
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:38,600
- Wow.

724
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:41,525
I always liked you because you're...

725
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:43,657
Because I'm intelligent.

726
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:46,803
Because I'm ambitious,
because I know what I want.

727
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:50,409
Save it, I've heard it all before.

728
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,119
You're in awe of me because,

729
00:41:53,169 --> 00:41:54,169
in your mind,

730
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:57,292
I'm something you cannot have.

731
00:41:57,342 --> 00:42:01,175
I take you to a place
you could only dream of.

732
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:05,753
You don't believe you deserve me.

733
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:06,720
You don't.

734
00:42:09,937 --> 00:42:10,770
I'm real.

735
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:13,395
You're fake.

736
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,409
- What are you talking about?

737
00:42:19,368 --> 00:42:21,738
What are you talking about?

738
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:24,860
I wanna be with you because I love you.

739
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,117
Simple as that.

740
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:28,820
- Nothing's ever that simple, Dan.

741
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:31,203
Or should I call you Stally?

742
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,332
Nothing's ever that simple.

743
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:37,811
When you fuck me at night,

744
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:39,168
what do you see?

745
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:42,713
More highrises.

746
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
No hustling.

747
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,689
No heavy burdens.

748
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:48,287
- What are you talking about?

749
00:42:48,337 --> 00:42:49,420
Fucking hell.

750
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:53,469
Listen, if you wanna fuck off,

751
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,352
fuck off.

752
00:42:56,772 --> 00:42:59,439
- That's the easy option for me.

753
00:43:00,535 --> 00:43:01,618
- Do it then.

754
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:03,908
Fuck off.

755
00:43:05,957 --> 00:43:06,790
- Okay.

756
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,240
- Where are you going?

757
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,457
Where are you going?

758
00:43:15,507 --> 00:43:16,369
Where are you going?

759
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:17,758
No, no, no, no.

760
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:18,725
I need you.

761
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:20,762
Stay.

762
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:24,551
Fucking stay.

763
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:27,597
Fucking stay.

764
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:34,811
Fucking stay.

765
00:44:37,448 --> 00:44:41,746
♫ How I ever went without you

766
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:44,379
♫ Is a mystery

767
00:44:47,931 --> 00:44:51,348
♫ Searching for my heart

768
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:56,722
♫ Til you threw away the key

769
00:44:58,996 --> 00:44:59,982
Shut up.

770
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:00,949
- Fuck off.

771
00:45:02,235 --> 00:45:03,068
Fuck off.

772
00:45:12,657 --> 00:45:14,324
I'm a fucking loser.

773
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:17,404
I can't fucking lose.

774
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:18,287
Why not?

775
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,273
I can't fucking be beaten.

776
00:45:21,323 --> 00:45:23,490
I can't be fucking beaten.

777
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:26,162
Why would I lose?

778
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:33,911
Why would I be beaten?

779
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:35,746
Why not?

780
00:45:39,925 --> 00:45:40,758
Why not?

781
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:44,784
Fucking why not?

782
00:45:55,355 --> 00:45:57,105
I can't fucking lose.

783
00:45:59,144 --> 00:46:00,680
So I am.

784
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:01,563
Fucking.

785
00:46:04,463 --> 00:46:05,463
Fucking why?

786
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:08,077
What's around me

787
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:10,275
is all I have.

788
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:13,131
It's fucking all I have.

789
00:46:15,498 --> 00:46:16,331
Shit.

790
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,810
She's my fucking life.

791
00:46:25,146 --> 00:46:27,229
Do you not want me in it?

792
00:46:31,352 --> 00:46:32,935
- I don't need you.

793
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,209
Don't need you.

794
00:46:39,719 --> 00:46:40,969
Don't need you.

795
00:46:44,124 --> 00:46:45,791
I don't need anyone.

796
00:47:01,978 --> 00:47:03,978
- No one's ever beat me.

797
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:10,103
That means something to me.

798
00:47:11,152 --> 00:47:13,402
That means something to me.

799
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:17,817
I don't even fight anymore.

800
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:20,446
I don't even fight anymore.

801
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:21,329
Fuck.

802
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,468
Please.

803
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:30,703
It means something.

804
00:47:30,753 --> 00:47:32,212
No wait.

805
00:47:32,262 --> 00:47:33,137
No, no wait.

806
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,687
I can't lose that.

807
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:39,167
I can't fucking lose that.

808
00:47:39,217 --> 00:47:40,378
I can't lose it.

809
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:41,634
I have no mother.

810
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,767
I have no fucking father.

811
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,431
I fucking did it by myself.

812
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:51,538
I got it by myself.

813
00:47:51,588 --> 00:47:54,111
I worked my way up all by myself.

814
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:55,354
All by myself.

815
00:47:55,404 --> 00:47:56,571
All by myself.

816
00:47:57,913 --> 00:47:58,746
No help.

817
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:04,115
I'm gonna fucking stay unbeaten, me.

818
00:48:04,165 --> 00:48:06,712
I'm fucking unbeaten Stall.

819
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:07,595
I am.

820
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:50,163
I can't lose that.

821
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:54,094
I can't fucking lose that.

822
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:25,086
I have half of her.

823
00:50:25,944 --> 00:50:27,277
One whole brain.

824
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:30,008
One half heart.

825
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:36,432
You hold the key to my iron lung.

826
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:40,148
When I breathe, you lock the door.

827
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:45,219
I keep hearing poetry.

828
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:47,019
I hear poetry of all.

829
00:50:49,384 --> 00:50:51,301
Keeping my mind at bay.

830
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:53,490
Don't leave.

831
00:50:55,164 --> 00:50:55,997
I'm sure.

832
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,467
I make decisions.

833
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:11,429
I make choices.

834
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,937
I make decisions.

835
00:51:17,898 --> 00:51:19,148
I make choices.

836
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:25,454
I made decisions.

837
00:51:26,965 --> 00:51:28,548
And I made choices.

838
00:51:45,804 --> 00:51:47,221
I made decisions.

839
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:50,685
Choices.

840
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:04,573
I made decisions.

841
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:07,111
I made choices.

842
00:52:09,613 --> 00:52:11,030
I made decisions.

843
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:14,017
I made choices.

844
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,337
I made decisions.

845
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,220
I made choices.
