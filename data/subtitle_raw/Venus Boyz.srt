00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:30,591
I play men. You see I have a moustache.

2
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:33,812
I play men but I also play women.

Bridge: Yeah.

4
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,889
<i>TD: How do you like it when you play men?</i>

5
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:42,138
I like it a lot. It’s fun.

6
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:43,504
Driver: It is, right?

7
00:00:43,529 --> 00:00:45,698
It’s fun because I’m not a man.

8
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:48,400
So it’s fun to put on that other gender.

9
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,677
Driver:   Did you ever think to be a man?

10
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:56,005
No, it’s more fun to be, to play than...

11
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:01,514
I don’t want to be a man. No.

12
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:04,370
Interviewer: When you play man
you play like husband role?

13
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:06,693
Like husband role?

14
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,570
I: Husband or boyfriend.

15
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,383
No. Actually, I don’t play
husbands really.

16
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:21,116
Sometimes maybe
when I play with a drag queen.

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,318
Some years ago

18
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:32,246
I set out on this journey

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,319
in search of women
who live in between

20
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:45,288
who also live the man within
whatever that means

21
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:51,979

had just got on its feet.

25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,688
Here I met Mo B. Dick and his friends.

26
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,417
Mo was co-initiator and moderator

27
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:38,846
of Club Casanova,

28
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:41,792
the first king meeting place.

29
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:50,463
Mo B. Dick: It was a variety,
a total mixture of people that went.

30
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:56,142
You didn’t know who’s who,
what sexuality anybody was.

31
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,546
Nobody cared.

32
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:00,975
Brothers and sisters,
I’m Reverend Jimmy Johnson

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,936
and I came here as a special messenger,

34
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:06,232
I came here as a special messenger
to tell you

35
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:11,000
to the people of New York city,
that the drag kingdom has come.

36
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,509
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

37
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:20,530
Amen.

38
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:28,576
And on the 8th day the gods
realised there must be a third sex.

drag will be done.

41
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:39,662
Brothers and sisters,
I have many many people ask me:

42
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:45,833
"Reverend Jimmy Johnson,
what is a drag king? I wanna know."

43
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,211
I’m here to tell you,
brothers and sisters:

44
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:51,742
A drag king is a person
who wants gender euphoria.

45
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:59,375
A drag king is a person who has accepted
their female masculinity.

46
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,139
Amen.

00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:20,019

48
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:23,754
actually the last few weeks

49
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:30,209
the weather has been
like almost Hawaii,

50
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,992
maybe St. Tropez
or something like that.

51
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,847
So I really have to cover up
so I don’t get a cold or something.

52
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:38,349
I already feel it coming.

53

[Written and directed by]

54
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:58,565
(German) I always had my eye
on pinstriped suits.

55
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,448
I had my first one at 17...

56
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,378
because I had seen David Bowie

57
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,552
wearing them.

58
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:06,481
And then I also wanted
to wear one.

59
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,156
I always wore

60
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:11,372
 androgynous and crossgender
make-up.

61
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:14,383
And I have been collecting

62
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:17,203
pinstriped suits for several years.

63
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,372
Hey Garland, this is Bridge.

64
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:29,904
I told you about this drag king night
that we’re doing on Tuesday the 23rd.

65
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:34,575
You know, there’s going to be
so many great drag kings in one show.

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,038
I hope you come.
Talk to you soon. Bye.

67
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:53,269
Society is more aware of drag queens
than they are of drag kings.

68
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,373
No one even really knew
what a drag king was.

69
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:01,359
And so we really wanted to introduce
that to the New York scene

70
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:05,913
and we wanted people to see that
gender is really undefined.

71
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:07,192
It’s what you make of it.

72
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:12,063
It really helped us to sort of
get full circle come from drag queens

73
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,204

74

(German) Biologically, I am a woman.

75
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:35,352
I don't want to change that,

76
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:36,503
but the point is...

77
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,633
that there are different
forms of femininity.

78
00:06:38,658 --> 00:06:40,566
And mine is definitely very androgynous.

79
00:06:44,368 --> 00:06:47,941

88
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,034
And I button it up slowly
up to the collar.

slowly up to the collar

90

and I put on my jacket

I feel a little bit more powerful.

to kinda stay hard.

"Here I am,
the whole world belongs to me."

release these asshole qualities

all of them, but many,

131
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:51,762
your hair off, they think
you deny your sexuality.

Calvin Klein and television,

in advertising and sitcoms and movies

the popular girl or the cool guy in school.

00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:37,862
and it’s like very now,
the dotcom film digital guys.

177
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,017
Film.

178
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:44,912
I’m making a film.

179
00:15:45,968 --> 00:15:48,836
I’m making an independent film.

180
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,908
I’m a filmmaker.

181
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,572
I’m writing a film.

182
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,931
I’m writing an independent film.

183
00:16:02,978 --> 00:16:05,985
Read my script you idiots.

184
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:09,032
I think I started out
in a political way

185
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:13,131
but not consciously
"I’m being political".

186
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:16,875
Any artist that breaks boundaries
it’s a political thing.

187
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,340
It’s saying like why not?
Why can’t I do this?

188
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:26,093
This is actually one of the first times
I ever did him as Martin in this act.

189
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:31,005
People either were screaming,:
"Oh my god, this is fabulous, I love him",

190
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,619
or were like
"Get off the stage, booh",

191
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,900
basically throwing tomatoes at me.

192
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:42,001
I think some women
really have the biology

193
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:46,864
to be like totally female
and some don’t.

194
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,900
And it’s the ones that don’t
that are made to be like

195
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:54,064
"I’m supposed to be a girl"
that have the problems.

196
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,319
Same with guys.

197
00:16:55,344 --> 00:17:00,791
Everyone is a little different
with what’s comfortable for them.

198
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:05,156
What we or our society
just doesn’t allow more than...

199
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,281
either you’re a blond nice girl
or you‘re a guy like that.

200
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:12,911
I mean there are
many degrees in between,

201
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:16,088
and that’s what we don’t allow
and that’s the problem.

202
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:37,666
Yeah you look good.
You look good babe.

203
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,301
Her name is Bridge Markland.

204
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:45,722
All the way from Berlin, darling.

205
00:17:45,747 --> 00:17:47,158
There she is!
Oh, my god!

206
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:49,885
Ladies and gentlemen:
Bridge Markland.

207
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,175
(German) It makes me happy
to be on stage,

208
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,542
where everything just flows,

209
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:31,487
where I am at home,
within myself

210
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:36,392
and I can draw creatively
from my own energy.

211
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,801
[music]

212
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,895
Basically, when I deconstruct
this sex bomb, Angela,

213
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,037
she's called Angela,
and approach the audience,

214
00:19:34,062 --> 00:19:39,550
androgynous, sexy,
self-confident, half-naked...

215
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:44,431
I choose my own sexual objects.

216
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,970
Sometimes, I have the urge
to shake people up,

217
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:03,373
to get very close to them and say:

218
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:06,377
"Here I am, and you can't avoid me.

219
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:09,261
And I stick my tongue out at you,

220
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:12,135
as if you were my father.

221
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,873
You can't escape.

222
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:18,408
Maybe you’re being filmed or watched.

223
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:22,898
You can't get away, you're here
and you have to look at me.

224
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:58,615
I really enjoyed her performance
because it was Weimar Germany,

225
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,109
kind of Bertold Brecht, kind of
feeling to it.

226
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:06,997
And I’m glad I got to do
the little tongue dance with her.

227
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:08,635
That was really fun.

228
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,717
(Knocking on the door)

229
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,870
<i>Philly: Hello?</i>

230
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:16,962
Hey it’s me.

231
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:19,130
Hi babe.

232
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,722
Come on in.

233
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:26,841
Are you coming down?

234
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,791
I identify with Brandon a lot,

235
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:42,534
because Brandon was stuck
in that small town insane mentality

236
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,445
and that’s really really scary.

237
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,947
Brandon Teena,
born as Teena Brandon

238
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:51,572
was killed in Nebraska, 1993,

239
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:55,294
for living as a man.

240
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:59,045
Well I went back down
to South Jersey where I lived

241
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,060
and when I was like 16
I went to my brother’s wedding

242
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:06,566
and I got beat up by 7 guys
on the board walk in New Jersey.

243
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,380
They started beating up
my friend calling him a faggot

244
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:12,966
and I jumped in and
I was pulling people off him

245
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:16,222
and they started like punching me,
I got punched in the face.

246
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,544
The cops weren’t doing anything either,

247
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:23,252
and this Italian woman
from behind the sausage stand

248
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,118
jumped out and just ran over
and grabbed me

249
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,670
and ran me off the board walk.

250
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,739
but it was like an angry mob mentality.

251
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,182
It was really scary.

252
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:36,001
I’ve always been gay and I’ve always been
butch or transgender even,

253
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:36,874
you know what I mean.

254
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,146
Growing up I identified as a little boy.

255
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,916
I liked girls but
I was really happy that...

256
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:44,717
I didn’t want a dick,
you know what I mean.

257
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,802
And I remember my brother
teasing me saying:

258
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:49,895
"Oh, we’re gonna send you to Denmark".

259
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,758
when I was little because
I was such a boy.

260
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:57,124
They don’t want women looking like men.

261
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,482
That’s the crossover.

262
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:04,294
Because I think it makes them feel
that they might be queer

263
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,590
if they like a butch version.

264
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:12,145
I would say that my male
is all drag queen

265
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,704
and my female is all amazon.

266
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:27,516
You know it’s an everyday thing for me.

267
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:31,227
When I take this off
I don’t assume a different role.

268
00:23:36,926 --> 00:23:40,533
It’s very hard to find anyone here
who will identify with the term butch.

269
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:45,002
Whereas in London, a lot of people
would say that one of the reasons

270
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:47,985
they are interested in dressing up
in drag is because they are butch,

271
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,916
and they love... this is just part
of what they love to do.

272
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:55,426
What is then butch exactly for you?

273
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:57,873
- What is it?
- Yeah, for you.

274
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:01,847
Butch is masculinity
as an identity in women.

275
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,598
I’m not butch or femme.
I’m just whatever I’m feeling.

276
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:07,595
I can be one way one day
and another way the other.

277
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:10,887
I can’t put myself in a category.

278
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:13,737
So you would sleep with a woman
in drag and you do drag.

279
00:24:13,762 --> 00:24:15,257
I would sleep in drag with a woman.

280
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:17,066
Well you’re just very versatile.

281
00:24:17,733 --> 00:24:19,630
But for me it's not whatever I’m feeling.

282
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:21,051
For you it’s different.

283
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:22,513
I would never wear a dress.

284
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,624
I only go out with feminine women.

285
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:29,762
I consider myself butch,
I can’t change it.

286
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:32,132
I admire that you can do that, Dréd.

287
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:33,215
But for me I can’t.

288
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,075
I can’t switch today and tomorrow
I’ll be something different.

289
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,210
You gotta be yourself.

290
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:39,319
And it’s this very strict thing.

291
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:48,164
[rap music]

292
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:03,869
I was inspired by seeing
a bunch of drag kings.

293
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,620
I thought it was very empowering.

294
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,096
And it made me wanna do the drag.

295
00:25:10,121 --> 00:25:12,133
I was like, I wanna give this a try.

296
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:21,220
The transformation
was definitely amazing.

297
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,895
And surprising.

298
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,229
I was like wow,
I look like a man.

299
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:29,967
A good looking one too.

300
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,400
I feel so natural that one time
I said that in my past life...

301
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:44,005
I definitely felt like
I’ve lived as a man before.

302
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,019
I’ve lived it in previous life times.

303
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,509
I believe in all that stuff.

304
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:56,463
I definitely feel like
I was a ladies man, definitely.

305
00:25:57,143 --> 00:25:59,079
I’m not sure exactly how it was.

306
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:03,459
But, you know, sometimes
having all the women

307
00:26:03,484 --> 00:26:07,052
and all that stuff
in line waiting, but it’s...

308
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:09,417
I’m not really like that.

309
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,788
Not in this lifetime anyway,
I’m not like that.

310
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:23,002
When I was growing up
I was very, very feminine.

311
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:26,982
I had big hair and red red lipstick
and all that stuff.

312
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:36,830
A lot of people think that
Dréd have all the women

313
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,160
every night a woman and all that,
but it’s not even like that.

314
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:42,224
I’m very shy and Dréd is shy too.

315
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:44,812
But Dréd is very respectful I feel,

316
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,521
like I perform and
the ladies are all screaming,

317
00:26:48,546 --> 00:26:51,208
sometimes they throw
heir bras at me and stuff.

318
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,239
But that’s as far as it goes
pretty much at the shows.

319
00:26:57,123 --> 00:26:58,943
This one is real.

320
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:18,254
Time to get dressed.

321
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,025
I love shoes.

322
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,698
Like the drag queens oh my god,

323
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:33,039
you see the shoes that Luscious wears?

324
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,196
Oh they are so sexy

325
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:39,082
and I like the pretty toes and
the nail polish and the long heels...

326
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,253
It turns me on.

327
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,173
It’s very exciting and sexual for me.

328

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a pleasure
to bring out an old time friend.</i>

[music]

331
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:18,951
I feel everybody has a male,

332
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:21,551
a masculine and feminine side.

333
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:24,762
But not everybody chooses
to explore the other side.

334
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:50,868
Stay just like that.

335
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:57,427
We met on Christopher Street,
which is in the west village in NY

336
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:01,283
where a lot of gay people
are up in the area, specially men.

337
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:07,315
I was walking and in front of me
there was this beautiful ass

338
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,106
Beautiful butt hanging out of
these really tight white shorts.

339
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:14,311
So she’s like "Excuse me".

340
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:18,559
I was like "Yes?". I had my moustache
so I didn’t want her to see my face.

341
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,741
So she’s like: "Excuse me",
I say: "Yes?"

342
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,412
She said: "Oh, how you doing?"

343
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:26,238
You know, cause she sees that I’m a man.

344
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:27,383
Looking still good.

345
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,214
Still... she played herself.

346
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:34,357
No I didn't play myself,
I still liked how he looked.

347
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:37,372
You know how the queens are,
you know what I'm saying.

348
00:29:37,397 --> 00:29:39,869
She still spoke to me but then again...

349
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:41,412
... still I wanted the digits.

350
00:29:41,437 --> 00:29:43,761
She still didn't want me to know
that she knows I am man.

351
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:46,242
Real honey, real.
Jiggle baby jiggle.

352
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,149
Well, she’s so nasty.

353
00:29:53,254 --> 00:29:55,888
But doesn’t it look real?

354
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:56,903
Yes, I like it.

355
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,311
Gay mean happy.

356
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:02,393
As long as you don't bother nobody.

357
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,328
Do what you want.

358
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:06,226
You wanna go to town now....

359
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:16,207
Well, got the pussy boots on.

360
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:20,221
The kings are coming along.

361
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,010
Dréd she’s the powerful one.

362
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:25,265
She keeps me on my feet, you know.

363
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:29,238
Oh we’re good good friends,
really good friends.

364
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:31,990
She thought she could be my girlfriend,
unfortunately I was a man,

365
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:01,521
I definitely wanna be a household name.

366
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:04,202
Dréd or Mildred.

367
00:31:04,227 --> 00:31:07,769
But it’d be nice to be more well known.

368
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:10,957
But it’s a step by step process
and I'm working on it.

369
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:12,733
So it doesn’t happen over night.

370
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:19,785
When I was going to the gym before work,
I would get up at 5:30 or 6,

371
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:25,913
go to the gym, tak a shower, go to work,
go to class after long very long days,

372
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:27,681
and this drag thing, in the beginning,

373
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:31,168
I was always performing like
3, 4 times a week,

374
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:32,919
just to get my name out there.

375
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,881
I have a full-time job
working on computers,

376
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:41,880
doing data processing and
creating computerized questionnaires

377
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:44,697
for a research institute in Manhattan.

378
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:51,702
My dream one day is to just
make a living of my creativity.

379
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,596
She’s always been the same person.

380
00:31:57,621 --> 00:31:59,434
I think that’s what’s so great about her.

381
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,075
It’s like Dréd and Mildred
are two different people

382
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,575
because when  you’re watching her perform

383
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,749
she’s like uninhibited,
she entertains you, she’s great.

384
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:10,132
But when you’re just with Mildred

385
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:15,399
she's a very shy person, very sweet,
soft spoken and everything.

386
00:32:15,424 --> 00:32:19,291
So it’s like she’s two different people.
I don’t think she’s changed at all.

387
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:29,013
It’s definitely helped me
to be more expressive.

388
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:31,851
Dréd has helped me to open
another sides of myself

389
00:32:31,876 --> 00:32:33,248
that I didn’t know I had.

390
00:32:33,273 --> 00:32:35,872
It has also helped me to feel that

391
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:39,132
it’s okay to try new things,
to be different.

392
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:45,878
It’s so different from
when I was growing up.

393
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:50,834
I was very shy, I was teased a lot
and I was very sad.

394
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:53,077
I believed people said
you're ugly and all that stuff,

395
00:32:53,102 --> 00:32:55,696
little kids could be so cruel.

396
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:00,514
And I believed them,
I didn't know how to deal with it.

397
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:01,728
I didn’t tell anybody.

398
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:04,331
I kept very quiet,
I didn’t really have any friends.

399
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,229
And so now it’s kind of totally opposite

400
00:33:07,254 --> 00:33:10,004
I feel I've bloomed and
I can look at myself and say

401
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,382
yes you’re beautiful,
you’re strong

402
00:33:13,936 --> 00:33:15,540
and you gotta do your thing.

403
00:33:15,565 --> 00:33:16,666
And it’s hard sometimes,

404
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:19,849
it takes time to heal
from those wounds.

405
00:33:28,197 --> 00:33:30,794
I feel I have my angels,
my guarding angels,

406
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:32,250
I am not really alone.

407
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:42,696
This is like my family portion
of this whole wall.

408
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,736
Because I have my family I’m born with

409
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:47,295
and I have my drag family,

410
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,503
so I mixed the pictures together.

411
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,607
And that’s me.

412
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:52,526
I’m so short compared
to all the queens.

413
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:53,980
They’re like towering over me.

414
00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:59,733
I have a lot of friends,
my family is very lovable...

415
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:01,357
and supportive.

416
00:34:02,178 --> 00:34:03,984
That’s me as a little girl.

417
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,832
I think I was in junior high school then.

418
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:11,986
That’s me and my mummy again.

419
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,679
I love my mummy.

420
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:23,535
I would like to have a relationship

421
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,689
and a serious one.

422
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:29,427
I hope one day to have one,
but that takes time.

423
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:38,178
[door bell]

424
00:34:45,922 --> 00:34:47,042
[knocking]

425
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,198
Hi there!

426
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:54,492
How are you doing?

427
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:57,280
- Good, and you?
- I'm good. Come on.

428
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,300
- Did you bring that book?
- Yes, I did.

429
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:00,289
All right, come on.

430
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:03,337
I was walking down a block
and you said good evening

431
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:04,475
and first I wasn’t sure.

432
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,063
I didn’t say good evening, I said:

433
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:06,884
"Good evening".

434
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:09,499
Well, I’m sorry I didn’t get
your fabulous voice and all.

435
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,211
It’s different.

436
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,547
Good evening.
[laughter]

437
00:35:12,635 --> 00:35:15,070
I turned back and saw you

438
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,873
and said "Is that a man or a woman?"

439
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:20,549
Because if I thought it was a man,

440
00:35:20,574 --> 00:35:22,599
I would be like "please".
[laughter]

441
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:24,771
No offense to men and all that.

442
00:35:25,245 --> 00:35:27,200
We dated for a little bit,

443
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,952
but we’re definitely better as friends.

444
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:30,928
Sisters.

445
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:31,858
We’re family.

446
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:34,682
You meet your family and
sometimes you’re confused at first,

447
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:37,009
you think it's your lover,
but it’s your cousin

448
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,464
or in Mildred's case,
she's my granny.

449
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:40,879
And you’re my grandson.

450
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:44,558
Now that we know who each other is
we get on much better.

451
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,571
When we were trying to date
we fought a lot.

452
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:49,311
Oh god, I don’t even know
how stupid was.

453
00:35:49,336 --> 00:35:50,748
You was trying to be the man.

454
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,584
Oh no, you know that’s not true.

455
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,280
You'd better take that back.

456
00:35:57,748 --> 00:36:00,441
So you have [incomprehensible]

457
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,279
[chatting]

458
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:12,831
Let's see.

459
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:15,064
And you got here.

460
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,622
On the side it looks kind of cute.

461
00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:18,748
I have a large head
and a lot of hair.

462
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:19,773
You're just wrong.

463
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:21,617
Need any assistance?

464
00:36:21,642 --> 00:36:23,693
Let me see here.
Let me go back.

465
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,827
I’m right here, granny.
right here for you.

466
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:27,744
I’ll fix that tag.
Come here, come here.

467
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,557
Let me come out.

468
00:36:29,582 --> 00:36:31,803
I feel in some way it’s different...

469
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:33,884
for black or white kings,

470
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:37,804
because  a lot I know don’t like
to show their womanhood.

471
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,777
They stay in male drag
during the whole show

472
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:41,892
and I like to mix it up.

473
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,372
I like to do a little stripping

474
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:46,271
and I show cleavage and stuff.

475
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:48,598
You know Dréd’s not here.

476
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,365
Dréd would be feeling it more,

477
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,792
because I got the make up on
and all that stuff.

478
00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:55,548
Bring out your inner Dréd.

479
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:57,449
[music]

480
00:36:57,474 --> 00:37:00,029
Storme: This is one of
my favourite songs in the world.

481
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,100
In some ways most of us

482
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:06,801
we all kind of make fun of
the characters we’re doing

483
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:09,818
but also I‘m paying tribute
to the music, our music.

484
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:13,133
It’s music I always loved
growing up and listening to.

485
00:37:13,158 --> 00:37:15,958
A lot of this seventies stuff,
Isaac Hayes, and...

486
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:18,590
the Commodores or...

487
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,706
I’ve even done Little Richard before.

488
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,717
Isaac Hayes, he’s the man,

489
00:37:28,742 --> 00:37:30,480
he’s the legend.

490
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:32,765
A friend of a friend of mine
gave me a poster

491
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,032
cause he said we look alike

492
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,561
And when I met him
I had some of my breasts showing

493
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,329
and he didn’t know
what was going on.

494
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:50,305
The first time Dréd was,
I was trying to catch a cab,

495
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,078
it was night time...

496
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:54,852
and just waiting for a cab,

497
00:37:54,877 --> 00:37:58,371
it took like a good hour
before I caught the cab.

498
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:00,395
They would slow down
and then run off.

499
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,164
This white woman
comes in front of me

500
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:03,478
and is trying to catch a cab,

501
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:05,853
I’m like "You don't see
I’m trying to catch a cab".

502
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:07,772
She’s like "Oh I’m sorry man".

503
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:10,070
And then she walked away.

504
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:12,059
But it’s just very frustrating.

505
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:16,160
So that felt really bad when I realised...

506
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,319
the stereotypes they have
in their heads of black men.

507
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,862
Like they won’t pay, they’ll rob them
or something alike

508
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,606
which is really stupid.

509
00:38:25,685 --> 00:38:27,887
Sometimes it’s really hard
for me, for Dréd

510
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:29,305
to catch a cab

511
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,781
and even as a woman
I experience that too at times.

512
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:37,464
You do have to be ready
to carry something

513
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:39,649
when you decide to define yourself.

514
00:38:39,674 --> 00:38:41,532
When you decide to be different than

515
00:38:41,557 --> 00:38:44,316
what the mainstream society
says is normal.

516
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:45,563
You may have to fight.

517
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:51,109
I think we’re very much
in the tradition too

518
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:52,872
because in African societies

519
00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:55,331
and in Native American societies

520
00:38:55,356 --> 00:38:56,867
there were always crossdressers,

521
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:58,346
and there were always people

522
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:02,084
 who played both roles,
both gender roles.

523
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,558
A lot of times...

524
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:07,139
they were the spiritual people,

525
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,440
the medicine people, the healers.

526
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:14,221
And somehow I think by demonstrating

527
00:39:14,674 --> 00:39:16,883
this comfortableness within ourselves

528
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:21,779
with both aspects of our gender identity,

529
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:27,676
that’s something healing
for people in general to see.

530
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,570
(singing poem)
I’m a stranger here, Lord,

531
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:44,841
I‘m a stranger everywhere.

532
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:56,475
I think I just realised
this year that I’m transgender.

533
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,612
[background singing]

534
00:39:57,637 --> 00:40:00,418
Without intending to
I find that I live my life

535
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:01,416
as a passing woman

536
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,089
and that I’m very often perceived
as a man.

537
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:04,988
Very often.

538
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:07,251
And it’s interesting.
I’m not flat chested.

539
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,406
This is only natural.

540
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:13,003
When I was in my twenties,
there was maybe one.

541
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:14,642
I’m 40 now.

542
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,625
And it’s just growing, I don’t know.

543
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,929
I think it’s interesting
because it’s different.

544
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,053
That's why I like it.

545
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:23,464
Because you don’t think
a woman should have it.

546
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,714
Before they didn’t think
we should have trousers,

547
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:27,738
before they didn't think
we should drive cars.

548
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:28,865
They didn't think so.

549
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,777
I think that the world is changing.

550
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:37,125
That’s me and my mum.

551
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:41,718
This believe it or not is my father.

552
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,281
There’s my father
after he joined the navy.

553
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:53,184
(poem) A slash of brilliant
tropical color

554
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:55,739
I was very fortunate to grow up
in a queer environment.

555
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:58,493
My mother is a lesbian,
my father was bisexual.

556
00:40:59,463 --> 00:41:01,000
So I remember when I was a child

557
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,862
and I saw a man and woman
kissing in a movie

558
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:06,659
it seemed so strange
and unnatural for me.

559
00:41:06,684 --> 00:41:09,225
Because what I knew was lesbians

560
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,647
and gay men, relating with each other.

561
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,639
I think that it was challenging,

562
00:41:13,664 --> 00:41:15,424
but I do think that it was a blessing.

563
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:18,782
Because I came into the earth
on so many margins,

564
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:24,406
because already my mother’s family
is Alaskan Indian and European,

565
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:27,564
my father’s family
is African and Choctaw.

566
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,863
So there was already such difference
within my mother’s family,

567
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,413
I’m the only black child.

568
00:41:33,438 --> 00:41:35,784
My mother’s a lesbian,
we were quite poor.

569
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,413
I’ve always been on the margins...

570
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:42,894
of race, of gender,

571
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:45,216
of sex, of class,

572
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:49,524
I think it gave me a lot of strength.

573
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:54,962
Because I had to become aware
of how to move in each world.

574
00:41:55,751 --> 00:42:00,201
While at the same time realising
I didn’t really belong into any of them.

575
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:04,525
My father died of...

576
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:07,974
carbon monoxide poisoning

577
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:10,242
He was in a car and he was cold,

578
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:12,372
he turned on the engine to be warm

579
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:13,741
and he fell asleep.

580
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:15,692
And he never woke.

581
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:17,872
He was 45.

582
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,369
(poem) I understand some things.

583
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:26,771
Like how life hurts sometimes

584
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,400
every moment

585
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:33,423
and how wearisome it gets always
trying to numb ragged feelings.

586
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,680
I don’t know any of his dreams.

587
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:40,456
I know that he ached inside sometimes

588
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:43,266
and sometimes he sent
that anguish outward

589
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:45,826
 just like a real man.

590
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,060
I know everybody wanted him

591
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,283
that green eyed sexy smile somebody.

592
00:42:58,195 --> 00:43:01,899
I know that filled a lot of hours
but in the end made nothing better.

593
00:43:03,006 --> 00:43:05,423
(singing) If you ever...

594
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:10,013
change your mind...

595
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:17,499
about leaving me behind...

596
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:23,228
bring it to me

597
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,115
bring your sweet loving...

598
00:43:29,252 --> 00:43:32,053
bring it all home to me.

599
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:37,158
Hey, sailor.

600
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,001
<i>There he is once again,
ladies and gentleman:</i>

601
00:43:57,026 --> 00:43:58,707
<i>Storme Webber!</i>

602
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:02,623
[singing]

603
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:08,465
... like a chain, like a chain...

604
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:17,735
I’m always intrigued in any form of art

605
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,158
with the concept of negative space,

606
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:22,584
the concept of what is around a thing
which defines that thing.

607
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:25,919
So with masculinity it’s the same.

608
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:27,413
It’s what’s around it.

609
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:31,070
It’s always the dichotomy.

610
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:32,578
Moving forward and holding back,

611
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,840
being strong and being vulnerable.

612
00:44:34,865 --> 00:44:36,583
And this is what is interesting,

613
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:39,982
What makes any performance good is...

614
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:41,127
passion.

615
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,800
(singing) ...like a train...

616
00:45:08,557 --> 00:45:11,916
Masculine, I don’t know
what masculine means.

617
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:12,938
That’s the thing.

618
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:15,881
Yes, what does masculine mean?
What is femenine?

619
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,376
One of my dolls she's matching me today,

620
00:45:19,401 --> 00:45:20,729
we're wearing green today.

621
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:23,706
This beautiful feminine doll.

622
00:45:24,673 --> 00:45:27,103
A spiritual thing of my people,

623
00:45:27,656 --> 00:45:28,776
gave her a little bell.

624
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,812
It’s hard. I can’t really define what’s
a man and what’s a woman,

625
00:45:32,837 --> 00:45:34,258
who's a man and who’s a woman.

626
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,288
And I don’t wanna define it.

627
00:45:37,313 --> 00:45:39,634
I think it’s great to just express it

628
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:41,315
and be what you wanna be

629
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,673
and be seen how you wanna be seen.

630
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,208
God have mercy
if I ran into my mum right now.

631
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:57,225
I share you with nobody.

632
00:46:01,546 --> 00:46:03,858
First of all, what do you think
makes a good man?

633
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:07,679
When somebody is just there for you.

634
00:46:07,704 --> 00:46:11,090
One is gonna hold you
through the thick and the thin.

635
00:46:11,454 --> 00:46:12,945
Someone who is on your side.

636
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,142
It doesn’t matter for sake.

637
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:18,251
Somebody is gonna be there for you.

638
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,457
Accept you for who you are,
no matter what.

639
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:25,067
Would you think I was a man or a woman
if you saw me walking down the street?

640
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:27,414
I definitely think you’re a man.
Definitely, definitely.

641
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:29,858
That’s what I look like.

642
00:46:33,964 --> 00:46:35,084
[incomprehensible]

643
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,979
First she has to become a lady.

644
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,964
And present herself right
to other people.

645
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:43,533
A lot of things make a good woman.

646
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:45,032
What does make a good man?

647
00:46:46,007 --> 00:46:47,883
- Treating a woman right.
- All right.

648
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:50,211
If he treats a woman right
he’s a good man.

649
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:52,263
And if he believes in God, too.

650
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,408
We were just talking about that.

651
00:46:54,433 --> 00:46:55,993
God comes first is the only judge.

652
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,872
What makes a good woman
and a good man?

653
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,768
The thing for me is not what’s defining that

654
00:47:05,793 --> 00:47:06,985
but what’s defining

655
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,736
the shifts of mind involved in that.

656
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:15,182
So whether you‘re defining yourself
sexually as female or not,

657
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,622
it’s what happens with expectations
in people’s minds.

658
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:20,042
Once I knew you're a woman...

659
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,458
[music]

660
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,420
[song] Are you a boy or a girl?

661
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:00,697
The moto that I always have said is:

662
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:04,628
Instead of being an angry woman
I became a funny man.

663
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:13,507
A drag king is camp.

664
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:15,277
There’s a whole camp aesthetic.

665
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:16,888
So there’s parody.

666
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:21,612
Mo B. Dick as John Sex
and his beautiful sidekick Bob.

667
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:23,205
[music]

668
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:53,872
Camp is hard to define.

669
00:48:54,173 --> 00:48:58,329
But generally, it has
a kind of kitschy element to it,

670
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:02,947
and also a certain amount
of foolishness.

671
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:18,534
Camp is a way to subvert sorrow also.

672
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:26,073
Diane Torr begat...

673
00:49:26,926 --> 00:49:28,041
Buster Hyman...

674
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:29,176
Pretty much, yeah.

675
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:30,321
...and Johnny Science.

676
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,725
I first heard of the drag king workshop
when I was in Boston.

677
00:49:36,096 --> 00:49:37,393
And I did the workshop

678
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:39,219
and it changed my life.

679
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:41,064
I got so high off it.

680
00:49:44,644 --> 00:49:47,942
On the trail with Diane Torr

681
00:49:48,348 --> 00:49:50,395
from Zurich

682
00:49:51,106 --> 00:49:54,456
to Hamburg
to New York, 1997.

683
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,373
I enjoy the experience of being a man.

684
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:04,165
People would step aside
when I walk down the street.

685
00:50:04,971 --> 00:50:06,237
It felt different.

686
00:50:06,728 --> 00:50:07,841
Very different.

687
00:50:08,658 --> 00:50:12,158
I could at last get my share of the seat
on the subway.

688
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,645
Even learned to pee in a urinal.

689
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,230
I have these three separate identities:

690
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:20,232
wife, mother and man.

691
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:23,958
But my husband and children

692
00:50:23,983 --> 00:50:26,389
couldn’t embrace my fantasies,

693
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:28,997
and so I had to leave.

694
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:33,374
I was interested in exploring
what it would be like to live as a man.

695
00:50:34,858 --> 00:50:38,883
And find another territory for myself.

696
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:56,088
There are times when I go out

697
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:01,001
as Danny King or Jack Sprat

698
00:51:01,026 --> 00:51:03,696
or Charles Beresford,
who’s my gay man,

699
00:51:05,664 --> 00:51:09,266
and I really get a vacation
from Diane.

700
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:13,356
You have a lot more
credibility as a man...

701
00:51:13,886 --> 00:51:15,001
in the world.

702
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:16,146
It’s just the way it is.

703
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:19,139
You walk into the room as a man

704
00:51:19,164 --> 00:51:21,000
and people immediately
pay you attention.

705
00:51:21,025 --> 00:51:22,720
You walk into a room as a woman

706
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,781
and they check you out if you’re sexy.

707
00:51:25,806 --> 00:51:26,922
That’s the first thing.

708
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:28,123
Men and women,

709
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:30,291
and if you’re a certain age,

710
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:34,254
once you’re over 40 or 35, forget it.

711
00:51:34,957 --> 00:51:38,103
Unless you’re particularly
elegant looking woman

712
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,608
and then people could be curious.

713
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:45,625
Mum.

714
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:47,731
<i>What? What?</i>

715
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:49,945
[music]

716
00:51:57,688 --> 00:51:59,508
That could work.

717
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,281
[music]

718
00:52:03,735 --> 00:52:06,109
Oh my god, I used to
gogo dance to this song.

719
00:52:13,646 --> 00:52:15,498
[city noises]

720
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:30,555
I came to this Aikido Dojo in 1977.

721
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,081
I have a third degree black belt.

722
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,588
Aikido has been a way for me to think

723
00:52:39,613 --> 00:52:42,455
about an ungendered situation.

724
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:44,986
It’s really about energy,

725
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:47,793
redirecting that negative energy

726
00:52:47,818 --> 00:52:50,722
into a place where
it’s not causing you any  harm.

727
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,610
Thank you.

728
00:53:11,952 --> 00:53:14,278
A lot of Aikido is about

729
00:53:15,397 --> 00:53:17,596
being able to extend,

730
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:18,746
not to withdraw.

731
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:20,906
Once you withdraw it’s over.

732
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,503
You have no more power.

733
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:24,114
So when I walk,

734
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:28,843
I have a sense of ownership,

735
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:30,140
a sense of belonging.

736
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,436
So that with each foot that I take,

737
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:36,247
you have a sense that
I could own that piece of floor,

738
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:39,768
for the minute that
my foot rests there.

739
00:53:41,197 --> 00:53:45,649
I have this 360 degree boundary
around myself.

740
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:49,977
Something that I learned in Aikido

741
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:52,643
that you need to stand

742
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:56,012
very solidly on the ground,
on the earth.

743
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:58,062
Tony, Eric and Larry,

744
00:53:58,087 --> 00:54:00,481
let’s see you occupy the space

745
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:03,290
let’s see how you can own...

746
00:54:04,113 --> 00:54:05,114
 the floor.

747
00:54:13,807 --> 00:54:15,418
You’re a bit of a loss aren’t you?

748
00:54:15,738 --> 00:54:17,493
- As a human being.
- Yeah.

749
00:54:17,675 --> 00:54:19,495
I'm just very like...

750
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:24,210
It’s all right Larry,
you can hide behind that hair.

751
00:54:24,235 --> 00:54:27,344
You have to remember that
boys grew up in playgrounds

752
00:54:27,369 --> 00:54:30,066
where they always had
to defend themselves.

753
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:35,863
So you need to develop more armour
actually in your physicality.

754
00:54:38,705 --> 00:54:40,985
How would this guy protect himself?

755
00:54:41,201 --> 00:54:45,037
Every 3 minutes a woman
is being abused in America,

756
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:46,187
something like that.

757
00:54:47,116 --> 00:54:50,117
If you think about that,
that’s astronomic.

758
00:54:54,822 --> 00:54:57,832
As a woman I’m really communicating

759
00:54:57,857 --> 00:55:02,349
and my gaze is on the edge,
is on the surface of my eyeball.

760
00:55:02,374 --> 00:55:05,310
I’m like looking out into the world
with a lot of curiosity

761
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,110
and a desire to communicate.

762
00:55:07,755 --> 00:55:11,454
As a man, as this man,
I’m a lot more reserved.

763
00:55:12,097 --> 00:55:14,173
I expect the world to come to me.

764
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:16,252
So I’m much more withdrawn.

765
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:29,565
- You've got some hair.
- Mhm.

766
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:35,254
So do you have an idea of
who this man could be?

767
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:39,027
Do you think an Argentinean man
for instance?

768
00:55:39,052 --> 00:55:40,438
Cause you’re Argentinean.

769
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:43,507
Do you think they’re very different
from American men?

770
00:55:43,532 --> 00:55:45,569
The way that they behave,
their gestures?

771
00:55:48,669 --> 00:55:50,836
Yeah, it will make a difference.

772
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:54,869
Men in Argentina I think
they have a lot of style.

773
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:57,871
They pay attention to
the way they look a lot.

774
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,773
[tango music]

775
00:56:02,477 --> 00:56:04,891
(Spanish) Se cabreó el varoncito.

776
00:56:06,383 --> 00:56:08,203
[tango music continues]

777
00:56:14,389 --> 00:56:18,185
There are many ways to construct a penis.

778
00:56:18,544 --> 00:56:20,475
When you fill it up with cotton wool,

779
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:22,380
then you have your penis.

780
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:24,600
That’s one way you can do it.

781
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:25,910
You can imagine the rest.

782
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:28,043
This is another method
that you can use.

783
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:29,990
I don’t work with dildos necessarily.

784
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:34,039
We just use this sausage,
that’s kinda like the fake penis

785
00:56:34,064 --> 00:56:35,956
and it’s really just for packing,

786
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:38,877
for you to have
this kind of lump in your pants.

787
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:42,033
This is something that you can use

788
00:56:42,058 --> 00:56:44,720
and when you use it you say
"I’m packing".

789
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,518
- It’s cold I know.
- It's clammy.

790
00:56:48,543 --> 00:56:52,465
It’s clammy but it’s got
a nice sticky quality to it.

791
00:56:54,776 --> 00:56:56,834
It looks good. Do that again.

792
00:56:59,005 --> 00:57:00,563
It’s stuck to my pants.

793
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:04,806
It wants you...
The penis wants you.

794
00:57:04,831 --> 00:57:06,601
It stretches.

795
00:57:15,189 --> 00:57:16,492
<i>The arousing reconstructions.</i>

796
00:57:16,517 --> 00:57:18,987
That was the first time I was in drag.

797
00:57:19,844 --> 00:57:21,781
We also developed

798
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:23,789
this androgynous movement vocabulary.

799
00:57:23,814 --> 00:57:25,838
It was 1981,

800
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:29,034
and nobody was really investigating
these ideas in performance.

801
00:57:31,229 --> 00:57:34,729
This is me as
the Jean Paul Belmondo character.

802
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:41,120
Now she only almost exclusively
does male characters.

803
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:43,612
She got a bit more fanatic and hooked into it.

804
00:57:47,025 --> 00:57:51,112
It fits her change in the physique
that she had over the years.

805
00:57:51,924 --> 00:57:54,607
She used to be a little boy

806
00:57:54,632 --> 00:57:55,898
and now she looks like...

807
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:57,517
a stubby man.

808
00:57:58,624 --> 00:58:01,362
I lived in Amsterdam for a couple of years

809
00:58:01,387 --> 00:58:03,537
and that’s where I met

810
00:58:03,562 --> 00:58:06,194
the father of Martina, my daughter.

811
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,538
This is during the birth,
where I screamed at Marcel:

812
00:58:09,563 --> 00:58:14,508
"You did this! I hate you!
You did this!"

813
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,870
I was so angry.

814
00:58:15,895 --> 00:58:17,809
You have all this extra emotion.

815
00:58:19,097 --> 00:58:20,142
I asked her.

816
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:22,215
I thought she could never get pregnant.

817
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:25,514
When she told me three weeks later,

818
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:26,693
she was surprised

819
00:58:26,718 --> 00:58:28,818
and I was surprised she was.

820
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:33,083
It was a bit confusing because
I didn’t know her at all.

821
00:58:33,108 --> 00:58:36,291
So it wasn’t really very planned.

822
00:58:36,316 --> 00:58:37,436
Sorry Tinkiu.

823
00:58:38,445 --> 00:58:40,588
Martina was totally demanding.

824
00:58:40,613 --> 00:58:42,886
It was very easy to be involved with her.

825
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:45,078
It creates beautiful children,

826
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:48,514
if you’re involved throughout.

827
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:51,384
<i>He’s been very, very supportive.

828
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:54,300
He’s a very special, wonderful man

829
00:58:54,325 --> 00:58:57,528
and I know that
I will know him all my life.

830
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:00,756
We’re parents to Martina.

831
00:59:01,711 --> 00:59:04,885
But in terms of our relationship...

832
00:59:06,493 --> 00:59:08,430
we’ve reached an impasse.

833
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:14,369
I went to Manchester in 1996
and I taught a workshop there

834
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:17,519
and that’s where I met Jane.

835
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:22,027
And Jane became my lover.

836
00:59:25,317 --> 00:59:31,060
I was having this relationship
with her in Europe

837
00:59:31,085 --> 00:59:35,097
and having this other kind of
relationship here,

838
00:59:35,122 --> 00:59:40,565
which is as a mother to Martina,
and living along side Marcel.

839
00:59:41,668 --> 00:59:44,961
Eventually, these things
are very hard to sustain

840
00:59:44,986 --> 00:59:47,812
and Jane decided that
she couldn’t deal with this anymore.

841
00:59:49,577 --> 00:59:50,967
And I feel heart broken.

842
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:09,721
Each of the characters
I create are composites.

843
01:00:09,746 --> 01:00:11,187
They’re not just one person.

844
01:00:11,212 --> 01:00:14,829
Like Danny King is a composite of...

845
01:00:14,854 --> 01:00:16,764
a number of ghastly men

846
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:21,584
I’ve seen and known from a young age.

847
01:00:25,274 --> 01:00:27,321
I grew up in Aberdeen in Scotland

848
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:31,060
and I had these uncles

849
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:34,532
who were towering above you
and you’re so impressed by them.

850
01:00:34,557 --> 01:00:36,411
They jingle change in their pockets.

851
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:38,438
And you think:
"Oh my god they’re rich".

852
01:00:38,463 --> 01:00:40,434
But of course it’s just coins.

853
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:43,728
But you’re 5 or 6 years old

854
01:00:43,753 --> 01:00:46,583
and you’re so impressed
by all this malebehaviour.

855
01:00:46,842 --> 01:00:48,053
Good evening, gentlemen.

856
01:00:49,099 --> 01:00:52,276
Welcome to the American society of men.

857
01:00:52,301 --> 01:00:54,742
I am here tonight to train you

858
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:59,058
how to gain and retain respect...

859
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,301
as a man.

860
01:01:02,977 --> 01:01:04,350
I’m much more controlled.

861
01:01:05,142 --> 01:01:07,517
My shoulders become more rounded

862
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:10,315
and so the breathing is deeper.

863
01:01:11,031 --> 01:01:11,788
Rule number 2:

864
01:01:13,554 --> 01:01:14,835
Stop smiling!

865
01:01:16,747 --> 01:01:18,575
It’s very nice when women smile,

866
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,253
it’s very appealing,
very unthreatening.

867
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:22,862
Makes them very friendly.

868
01:01:23,695 --> 01:01:25,209
But when a man smiles

869
01:01:25,234 --> 01:01:28,377
that could be conceived
as a conceding ground.

870
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:32,926
Allowing you a possibility to be exploited.

871
01:01:33,164 --> 01:01:34,355
Rule number 3:

872
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:40,648
Stop apologizing!

873
01:01:41,021 --> 01:01:44,688
Cause as a man in a man’s world
you are right.

874
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:46,597
And even if you’re not.

875
01:01:46,622 --> 01:01:49,512
Who goes around saying
"I’m sorry!" all the time?

876
01:01:52,945 --> 01:01:57,954
As women it’s like we’re open
for access 24 hours a day.

877
01:01:59,594 --> 01:02:01,302
People have to like us.

878
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:05,858
That’s like the ruling thing in our psyches.

879
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:09,378
What does it mean to be a woman?

880
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:15,298
What kind of a woman am I?

881
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:16,761
I want you...

882
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:18,466
to like me.

883
01:02:20,224 --> 01:02:21,174
I want you...

884
01:02:22,275 --> 01:02:23,675
to hold me.

885
01:02:25,361 --> 01:02:26,780
I want you...

886
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:29,513
to fulfil my dreams.

887
01:02:29,853 --> 01:02:31,853
[sound of kisses]

888
01:02:35,224 --> 01:02:36,634
I want...

889
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,760
to be part...

890
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:41,124
of you.

891
01:02:43,824 --> 01:02:45,967
I created this character

892
01:02:45,992 --> 01:02:48,303
who starts off being someone
who pleases everybody

893
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:51,443
but then have her transform.

894
01:02:56,609 --> 01:02:58,286
I don’t particularly like Danny King.

895
01:02:59,169 --> 01:03:02,690
It’s more dealing with a reality

896
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:05,226
of how most men are.

897
01:03:13,068 --> 01:03:14,699
It is a kind of a parody

898
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,472
but people have told me
that he’s real.

899
01:03:16,497 --> 01:03:18,597
And I know he is, unfortunately.

900
01:03:22,529 --> 01:03:25,757
What I’m saying is
that if I can do this,

901
01:03:26,576 --> 01:03:30,582
from this female who’s like

902
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:33,125
the woman who lives next door,

903
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,981
and I can become this man
who’s Mr Macho,

904
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:39,172
then anybody can do it.

905
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:40,895
And if that’s the case then

906
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,176
so much for masculinity
being sacred.

907
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,249
We can have a penis
any time we want,

908
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:54,273
any size and any shape or form.

909
01:03:54,298 --> 01:03:57,592
I actually think that it’s men

910
01:03:58,255 --> 01:04:00,503
who have penis envy of other men.

911
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:05,736
A particular favourite
of the housewives,

912
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:07,202
the women who stay at home

913
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:09,249
and all they have for company

914
01:04:09,274 --> 01:04:13,636
is their dishwasher,
their vacuum cleaner

915
01:04:14,373 --> 01:04:18,224
and I call this one vacuum gigantum.

916
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:19,727
You can think of them as props,

917
01:04:19,752 --> 01:04:21,258
not necessarily as phalluses.

918
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:23,998
I don’t think there’s anything wrong

919
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:26,039
with something looking like
a phallus anyway.

920
01:04:26,064 --> 01:04:28,805
Because who is the person
who’s handling it.

921
01:04:29,391 --> 01:04:33,356
You don’t need to have
a man attached to it.

922
01:04:33,381 --> 01:04:36,181
It’s just there, it’s available,
why not use it.

923
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:42,038
And you wanna maintain
the impregnability at all costs.

924
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:49,488
Keep your movements...

925
01:04:49,513 --> 01:04:50,521
minimal,

926
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:52,364
guarded,

927
01:04:52,793 --> 01:04:53,802
repetitive.

928
01:04:59,892 --> 01:05:01,441
I would always use my father

929
01:05:01,466 --> 01:05:04,906
as an image of like
my male in my life.

930
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:08,500
And he is so gentle and kind
and he’s really sweet.

931
01:05:08,525 --> 01:05:09,988
He’s so different from Danny King.

932
01:05:11,145 --> 01:05:14,350
I’d always say to her:
"Mum, you’re totally stereotyping.

933
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:17,117
I don’t want the whole world to think

934
01:05:17,142 --> 01:05:19,259
that you think
this is the only type of guy

935
01:05:19,284 --> 01:05:21,384
or this is the real kind of guy".

936
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,680
A pleasure,
My name is Jack Sprat.

937
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,365
It’s really great
to see you all here tonight

938
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:32,319
to come see me perform.

939
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:34,075
I know it’s a lot of other people

940
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,096
but it’s really nice
you can see me perform.

941
01:05:36,405 --> 01:05:38,225
[music and singing]

942
01:05:47,504 --> 01:05:49,910
I know I’m somebody

943
01:05:50,957 --> 01:05:53,120
who has been doing this a long time.

944
01:05:53,145 --> 01:05:55,905
So obviously I have
a certain amount of authority.

945
01:05:57,026 --> 01:06:00,302
I know they think of me
as a daddy drag king.

946
01:06:00,555 --> 01:06:02,375
[harmonica playing]

947
01:06:16,802 --> 01:06:19,388
It’s much easier to be a powerful woman

948
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:20,830
behind the mask of a man.

949
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:24,579
And it's much more socially acceptable
to express anger

950
01:06:24,604 --> 01:06:26,790
when you’re a man,

951
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:29,672
and the aggressive behaviour
as a man.

952
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:31,264
As a woman people go:

953
01:06:31,289 --> 01:06:33,001
"Ah bitch!

954
01:06:33,297 --> 01:06:34,950
What’s the matter with you?"

955
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:37,696
That’s exactly true because

956
01:06:37,721 --> 01:06:40,473
I was always punished in a female form

957
01:06:40,498 --> 01:06:41,974
because I was too aggressive.

958
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:43,494
Now I have permission.

959
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:46,396
People just see me.

960
01:06:46,421 --> 01:06:49,413
I don’t perceive myself as a man,
nor as a woman for that matter

961
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:51,258
but people perceive me as a man.

962
01:06:51,283 --> 01:06:53,139
I can be invisible as a man,

963
01:06:53,164 --> 01:06:56,662
whereas for some reason
as a female I never was.

964
01:06:56,687 --> 01:07:01,600
No, it really is
a subliminal absence of hostility.

965
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,299
Men relate to me as a man

966
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:06,239
and they are not guarding themselves.

967
01:07:06,264 --> 01:07:09,928
Men look after men,
I’m telling you.

968
01:07:16,106 --> 01:07:17,472
See how that works.

969
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:19,508
You want me to look
right into the lens?

970
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:22,158
Yeah. Let's rehearse that.

971
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,986
Give me that look.
Yeah that’s it.

972
01:07:29,687 --> 01:07:32,103
There was so much
great discussion last night.

973
01:07:33,556 --> 01:07:35,653
I felt like I wanted to talk more.

974
01:07:35,678 --> 01:07:37,021
Should I try the other side?

975
01:07:41,514 --> 01:07:44,520
What happened was,
I was doing drag so much

976
01:07:44,545 --> 01:07:46,165
like 4 and 5 times a night.

977
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:49,096
And people always were:
oh Mo. B. Dick, Mo. B. Dick.

978
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:53,294
And then Mo Fisher’s getting lost.

979
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:58,186
I felt my inner man
overtook my inner woman.

980
01:07:58,802 --> 01:08:02,920
As a result I lost sight of my female self.

981
01:08:09,573 --> 01:08:11,971
(singing) Are you a boy or a girl?

982
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:18,397
What I did was, it’s difficult to explain,

983
01:08:18,422 --> 01:08:20,619
but so it’s like I said:

984
01:08:20,644 --> 01:08:23,680
that is my male side,

985
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:25,478
now what’s my female side?

986
01:08:25,503 --> 01:08:28,210
I became confused and I said:
"Wait a minute.

987
01:08:28,235 --> 01:08:30,549
I am a very aggressive woman

988
01:08:30,574 --> 01:08:32,786
and I will remain an aggressive woman."

989
01:08:35,308 --> 01:08:38,009
What is interesting is that they say,

990
01:08:38,034 --> 01:08:40,679
spiritually your left side
is your female side

991
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,554
and your right side
is your male side.

992
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:44,264
And I’m reversed in the outfit.

993
01:08:46,254 --> 01:08:47,654
[jiggling]

994
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:51,091
<i>That's it. I have to change film.</i>

995
01:08:51,116 --> 01:08:52,991
<i>That’s interesting because...</i>

996
01:08:56,168 --> 01:08:57,801
it was my left side

997
01:08:57,826 --> 01:09:00,513
that overdeveloped
as female in the chest

998
01:09:00,538 --> 01:09:04,135
and my right breast
didn’t develop at all.

999
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:30,712
These are photographs of Mo
that I took in New York.

1000
01:09:30,737 --> 01:09:36,296
When Mo was wearing the fabulous
half man, half woman costume.

1001
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:42,787
[water dripping]

1002
01:09:44,884 --> 01:09:47,578
I think gender is performance

1003
01:09:47,603 --> 01:09:49,915
and I think gender is
more than performance.

1004
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:53,800
I think that people
subconsciously perform

1005
01:09:53,825 --> 01:09:57,586
whatever gender role
they’ve been assigned,

1006
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,470
but people might subvert that.

1007
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:07,413
Generally people conform,

1008
01:10:07,438 --> 01:10:10,871
generally men don’t go around
wearing make up and dresses

1009
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:14,822
and generally women
don’t go around...

1010
01:10:16,715 --> 01:10:18,255
scratching their balls.

1011
01:10:22,586 --> 01:10:26,138
We don’t as individuals
reinvent the meaning of gender.

1012
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,605
Each person individually,
one person at a time.

1013
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,505
We come into genders

1014
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,267
that have already been
constructed for us.

1015
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:38,547
within political, economic,
social, cultural contexts.

1016
01:10:42,108 --> 01:10:45,228
So what we do when we’re in a gender

1017
01:10:45,253 --> 01:10:50,376
is perform an already socially
constructed script.

1018
01:10:54,094 --> 01:10:56,372
A medically accepted clitoris

1019
01:10:56,397 --> 01:10:59,305
is between 0 and 1 cm,

1020
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:01,677
and a medically acceptable penis

1021
01:11:01,702 --> 01:11:07,711
has to be between 2,5 and 4,5 cm.

1022
01:11:07,736 --> 01:11:12,108
If you fall in between
the 1 and the 2,5,

1023
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:14,558
they usually cut it off

1024
01:11:15,196 --> 01:11:19,902
because they deem
it would be very very bad for a man

1025
01:11:19,927 --> 01:11:21,719
to have a penis that was too small

1026
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:24,981
or for a woman to have
a clitoris that was too large.

1027
01:11:25,006 --> 01:11:27,157
So generally they just whack it off

1028
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:32,265
and give no thought
to the sexual pleasure of the child

1029
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,556
when they become an adult.

1030
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,022
<i>They still do that?</i>

1031
01:11:35,047 --> 01:11:36,370
Yeah, they still do that.

1032
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:41,528
In my everyday life

1033
01:11:41,553 --> 01:11:44,502
I’m probably perceived as a man.

1034
01:11:45,324 --> 01:11:48,404
It's fine for people
to perceive me as a man.

<i>The Drag King book</i> premiere

by Del LaGrace Volcano

1037
01:11:52,594 --> 01:11:55,230
That doesn’t mean
that’s how I perceive myself.

1038
01:11:55,255 --> 01:11:58,659
I perceive myself
in the same way that I always have,

1039
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:03,827
which is something that is
a combination of both.

1040
01:12:04,264 --> 01:12:06,595
Sometimes maybe
more female than male,

1041
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,465
sometimes maybe
more male than female.

1042
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:18,207
I know five men personally
that also have vaginas,

1043
01:12:18,232 --> 01:12:21,345
I know lots of men
that also have breasts.

1044
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,094
And I know lots of women
who have beards.

to a Drag King performance

1047
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:29,438
in Cologne, 1997.

1048
01:12:29,463 --> 01:12:31,703
Being a drag king for me

1049
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:34,232
was a way to begin this journey.

1050
01:12:34,899 --> 01:12:36,798
But it isn’t necessarily.

1051
01:12:38,163 --> 01:12:40,431
It’s not like you go:

1052
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,523
I’m gonna be a cross-dresser,

1053
01:12:42,548 --> 01:12:44,291
then I become a drag king

1054
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:46,345
then I become a transsexual.

1055
01:12:46,665 --> 01:12:48,320
No. No. No.

1056
01:12:48,345 --> 01:12:50,198
That’s what people are afraid of

1057
01:12:50,223 --> 01:12:53,205
and for maybe some of us, yes.

1058
01:12:56,703 --> 01:13:01,436
Meine Damen-Herren,
Herren-Damen.

1059
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:05,237
Ich bin Herr Doctor Delman.

1060
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:08,041
Now most of you here are

1061
01:13:08,066 --> 01:13:12,255
what I call monogendered,

1062
01:13:13,316 --> 01:13:16,149
some are bigendered,
and some are omnigendered.

1063
01:13:16,174 --> 01:13:19,649
Myself I’m transgendered.

1064
01:13:21,195 --> 01:13:23,393
This is me with my family.

1065
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:30,842
Can you show
a little bit of your stomach?

1066
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:38,644
When I was born I was assigned
to the female gender.

1067
01:13:45,845 --> 01:13:49,224
My first conscious realisation

1068
01:13:49,249 --> 01:13:51,745
that I didn’t quite fit as a girl

1069
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,768
came when I was about 5 years old.

1070
01:13:57,735 --> 01:14:01,029
I never behaved appropriate
for a female.

1071
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:06,424
But I really didn’t see myself

1072
01:14:06,449 --> 01:14:09,278
as anything other than
a girl until puberty.

1073
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:19,579
I always thought I was ugly.

1074
01:14:23,408 --> 01:14:24,580
This was...

1075
01:14:26,317 --> 01:14:27,782
This one here

1076
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:30,440
 was me right before
I had my hair cut.

1077
01:14:30,465 --> 01:14:32,280
I guess I was about 22 there.

1078
01:14:33,263 --> 01:14:36,047
I have a silicon implant
that I never wanted.

1079
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,278
I too always wanted a flat chest.

1080
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:43,519
Being female is what I construct.

1081
01:14:45,073 --> 01:14:47,354
Naturally if you have a default,

1082
01:14:47,379 --> 01:14:49,696
my default is masculine.

1083
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:56,051
Being a drag king, once
I was  performing as a man

1084
01:14:56,076 --> 01:14:58,900
that did not feel as a performance,

1085
01:14:58,925 --> 01:15:01,352
that just felt pretty natural.

1086
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:03,947
It wasn't as much fun
and it still isn't.

1087
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:08,861
I still far prefer to be
a drag queen than a drag king.

1088
01:15:17,123 --> 01:15:21,587
Right now I'm in the process of trying
to get my gender amended

1089
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:25,851
on my American passport
to ‘O’ designation.

1090
01:15:25,876 --> 01:15:29,538
They have male, female and
since the beginning of this year

1091
01:15:29,563 --> 01:15:34,090
in the software
you can be ‘O’ for other

1092
01:15:34,115 --> 01:15:37,675
or it could change
to ‘I’ for intersex.

1093
01:15:38,626 --> 01:15:41,766
Right now on my passport it says female.

1094
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,464
I had to pluck my beard out
every morning

1095
01:15:45,489 --> 01:15:48,085
from late teenagehood.

1096
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:50,792
And it was so cute,

1097
01:15:50,817 --> 01:15:53,140
the natural one was just
these two little horns

1098
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:55,379
coming out of the side of the chin.

1099
01:15:56,558 --> 01:15:59,327
And some moustache as well.

1100
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:01,077
Basically she told me:

1101
01:16:01,102 --> 01:16:02,809
"If you don't stop plucking
your eyebrows,

1102
01:16:02,834 --> 01:16:05,085
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to go out with you.

1103
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,691
<i>I couldn't stand it.</i>

1104
01:16:07,555 --> 01:16:08,655
It was like such a relief.

1105
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,033
I didn't have to pluck my eyebrows,

1106
01:16:11,058 --> 01:16:13,874
I didn't have to wear
make up or skirts.

1107
01:16:13,899 --> 01:16:16,384
I didn't have to perform
as a female anymore.

1108
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:19,263
I came to get my prescription.

1109
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,760
I do testosterone injections.

1110
01:16:26,785 --> 01:16:29,975
It's a deep muscle injection.

1111
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,940
-... for the other two.
- Tomorrow.

1112
01:16:32,192 --> 01:16:35,126
Give it to me, give it to me.

1113
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:37,212
Your voice lowers,

1114
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:40,433
your period stops,

1115
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:42,505
fat redistribution,

1116
01:16:43,707 --> 01:16:45,663
clitoral enlargement.

1117
01:16:46,136 --> 01:16:48,408
They say those are irreversible.

1118
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:52,017
We don't know what
the long-term consequences are

1119
01:16:53,516 --> 01:16:56,517
of a female born person

1120
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:59,138
taking male hormones
over a long period of time.

1121
01:16:59,723 --> 01:17:03,411
You have to bear in mind that
there could be health risks

1122
01:17:03,436 --> 01:17:06,940
that you're not aware of
or that haven't been recognized yet.

1123
01:17:10,597 --> 01:17:14,826
Finding Simo for me was
so amazing

1124
01:17:14,851 --> 01:17:18,908
because she was the first woman
I had been with

1125
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:23,599
who had a really positive,
healthy attitude towards men.

1126
01:17:24,766 --> 01:17:26,814
She wasn't anti men at all

1127
01:17:28,134 --> 01:17:32,786
and we were both attracted to
the masculinity of each other.

1128
01:17:34,242 --> 01:17:38,052
We've been together and not together
for about 6 years.

1129
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:42,874
I said: "Would you like to
come home with me tonight

1130
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:45,790
or would you like to wait
for a proper date?"

1131
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:49,343
And I was very impressed by that.

1132
01:17:49,368 --> 01:17:52,994
I've never been asked that way before.

1133
01:17:53,019 --> 01:17:53,971
It has always been:

1134
01:17:53,996 --> 01:17:56,712
"Would you like to come home
with me tonight?"

1135
01:17:56,737 --> 01:17:58,640
or something like that.

1136
01:17:58,665 --> 01:18:01,393
Never giving me a choice like that.

1137
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,099
I was so impressed that...

1138
01:18:04,606 --> 01:18:06,402
You said: "Can I think about it?".

1139
01:18:06,427 --> 01:18:09,656
I did say:
"I have to think about it first".

1140
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,725
I think our relationship
is really a lot in some ways

1141
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:19,483
like some successful
gay male relationship.

1142
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:22,402
They're together,
they're devoted.

1143
01:18:23,964 --> 01:18:26,316
Yet they know that after a while

1144
01:18:26,341 --> 01:18:31,320
the sex with only one person
gets boring.

1145
01:18:32,765 --> 01:18:34,389
And I'm not threatened by Simo

1146
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:36,371
going and having sex
with other people.

1147
01:18:36,396 --> 01:18:38,351
I totally understand that.

1148
01:18:51,154 --> 01:18:54,371
I would like to have still
a more masculine body.

1149
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:59,745
I'm waiting for a chest operation

1150
01:19:01,729 --> 01:19:06,566
and I think that once I have that
I'll feel much better in my body.

1151
01:19:10,531 --> 01:19:13,158
I feel that I'm less aggressive now

1152
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:16,713
than I was before
I started using testosterone,

1153
01:19:16,738 --> 01:19:20,191
because I no longer have
to be as aggressive

1154
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:21,312
to get what I want.

1155
01:19:21,337 --> 01:19:23,283
Because people perceive me as a man,

1156
01:19:23,308 --> 01:19:26,211
they're more likely to give me
what I want without a fight.

1157
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:29,682
It was only when people
started seeing me as a guy

1158
01:19:29,707 --> 01:19:33,526
that I realized how much
of a man's world it really is.

1159
01:19:33,551 --> 01:19:36,892
Because, I am treated
with more respect.

1160
01:19:37,517 --> 01:19:39,291
It's amazing how friends of mine,

1161
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,658
who I'm sure are not aware of it,

1162
01:19:41,683 --> 01:19:44,014
but that have known me before
and know me now,

1163
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:46,734
just because it's like

1164
01:19:46,759 --> 01:19:49,817
women are trained
and totally socialised

1165
01:19:49,842 --> 01:19:52,276
to look after men.

1166
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,354
And I'm telling you
it's so amazing how they do it.

1167
01:19:57,379 --> 01:20:00,250
And men talk to each other different
than they talk to women.

1168
01:20:00,275 --> 01:20:01,528
We all know these things,

1169
01:20:01,553 --> 01:20:05,191
but actually experiencing it
can be really sad.

1170
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:08,227
It can be really really sad to see

1171
01:20:08,252 --> 01:20:12,065
how great the sex war is
between men and women.

1172
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:18,424
How much fear and anger
and hostility there really is.

1173
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:21,207
The one thing that I have lost is...

1174
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:25,926
I can't indiscriminately flirt
with anybody.

1175
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:30,025
I used to flirt with people,
mainly to get a discount.

1176
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:34,803
And I would flirt even as an obvious dyke,

1177
01:20:34,828 --> 01:20:36,336
I would flirt with straight guys

1178
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,556
and I would usually get a discount,

1179
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:41,684
just by being funny or flirtatious.

1180
01:20:41,709 --> 01:20:44,017
If a man looks too long at a man,

1181
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:45,739
he's probably gay

1182
01:20:45,764 --> 01:20:47,774
or trying to pick that guy up.

1183
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:49,976
So that's what happened
to me in Austria.

1184
01:20:50,001 --> 01:20:51,732
I was just looking at this guy

1185
01:20:51,757 --> 01:20:53,355
thinking how beautiful he was...

1186
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,072
for too long.

1187
01:20:55,133 --> 01:20:57,458
And he came up with his fist saying:

1188
01:20:57,483 --> 01:20:59,952
"What the fuck are you
looking at me for, faggot?"

1189
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,779
I said: "Excuse me,

1190
01:21:04,248 --> 01:21:05,558
I thought you were gay."

1191
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:08,576
And then I really got in trouble,
but never mind.

1192
01:21:20,725 --> 01:21:23,588
I've always been since I was 16

1193
01:21:23,613 --> 01:21:27,713
open to all sexual possibilities.

1194
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:30,878
I wouldn't say I'm a Casanova,

1195
01:21:30,903 --> 01:21:33,485
but I have had a lot of
sexual adventures.

1196
01:21:34,734 --> 01:21:38,113
The film is called <i>Pansexual Public Porn</i>,

1197
01:21:38,138 --> 01:21:40,824
also known as
<i>The adventures of Hans and Del</i>

1198
01:21:40,849 --> 01:21:45,409
Pansexual is how
I describe my sexuality

1199
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:47,587
and how Hans describes his sexuality,

1200
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:51,091
in that we don't discriminate
on the basis of gender.

1201
01:21:51,116 --> 01:21:55,278
We don't choose
our sexual relationships

1202
01:21:55,303 --> 01:21:58,964
depending on if they're male,
female or other.

1203
01:22:00,182 --> 01:22:02,651
Usually this is called bisexuality,

1204
01:22:02,676 --> 01:22:07,093
but to me to say bisexual
reinforces the binary idea

1205
01:22:07,118 --> 01:22:09,885
that there is only male and female.

1206
01:22:11,664 --> 01:22:14,731
We had planned to do something
like that together for ages.

1207
01:22:15,101 --> 01:22:17,468
I was just being a model
which was great.

1208
01:22:17,493 --> 01:22:20,907
It was just getting stoned and...

1209
01:22:20,932 --> 01:22:22,957
having sex with these people in the woods.

1210
01:22:22,982 --> 01:22:26,909
It's very difficult
for each one of us

1211
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:29,878
to understand that other people
have such a different life.

1212
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:33,323
That seeing a film like
<i>Pansexual Public Porn</i>

1213
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,708
is very strange for them.

1214
01:22:34,733 --> 01:22:39,249
But to me this is actually
my everyday life.

1215
01:22:39,274 --> 01:22:41,982
To experiment,
to have different projects.

1216
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:44,783
That summer the project was to see

1217
01:22:44,808 --> 01:22:47,327
if we could have gay men
having sex with us.

1218
01:22:47,352 --> 01:22:49,276
And it was very very exciting.

1219
01:22:49,301 --> 01:22:53,669
Because we didn't know
if we would be accepted or rejected,

1220
01:22:53,694 --> 01:22:57,114
and mostly we were accepted,
which was really cool.

1221
01:22:57,869 --> 01:22:59,689
[background music]

1222
01:23:09,643 --> 01:23:13,519
You can't look at this
with your perfectionist eye for now.

1223
01:23:13,544 --> 01:23:14,283
Ok.

1224
01:23:14,308 --> 01:23:16,567
I'm really changing everyday so much

1225
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,664
that the moment you tell someone

1226
01:23:18,689 --> 01:23:21,009
"this is how it is,
this is how it was before",

1227
01:23:21,034 --> 01:23:22,724
the next day that's not true...

1228
01:23:22,749 --> 01:23:26,101
so you fictionalise all the time.

1229
01:23:27,726 --> 01:23:30,489
I've lived as a so-called woman
for 40 years

1230
01:23:30,514 --> 01:23:34,538
so if I'm lucky and I live until 80,

1231
01:23:34,563 --> 01:23:36,897
I can live the rest of my life
as a man.

1232
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:40,084
It’s a balancing act.

1233
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:43,242
In these times I don't go out
a lot to have sex,

1234
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:44,593
because I'm painting now.

1235
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:46,204
I'm so into the painting.

1236
01:23:49,362 --> 01:23:53,036
I'm more interested in general
about transformation.

1237
01:23:53,971 --> 01:23:57,223
How can we learn to have
a non-discriminatory mind,

1238
01:23:57,248 --> 01:24:00,886
or how can we learn to use
our discriminatory mind

1239
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,653
for practical things,

1240
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:07,636
but not to judge people
or to judge ourselves.

1241
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:11,791
Whatever I am, I am.

1242
01:24:12,874 --> 01:24:14,819
I try to be as much myself as I can,

1243
01:24:14,844 --> 01:24:18,045
negotiate with life and
with other people

1244
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:21,341
so that's possible, to live
as lively as possible.

1245
01:24:21,366 --> 01:24:22,766
[laughing]

1246
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:26,766
With all the flaws that one has...

1247
01:24:27,956 --> 01:24:29,391
and the cruelties and...

1248
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:32,559
difficulties.

1249
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:42,949
I wouldn't describe it
as a dream coming true.

1250
01:24:42,974 --> 01:24:46,935
In a way it's living the reality.

1251
01:24:47,409 --> 01:24:50,026
It's living a reality
of more completeness.

1252
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:52,619
[bar noises]

1253
01:24:59,466 --> 01:25:01,468
[peeing sound]

1254
01:25:07,322 --> 01:25:09,604
If I always had to use the cubical,

1255
01:25:09,629 --> 01:25:12,490
I'd often have to wait a long time

1256
01:25:12,515 --> 01:25:17,049
and hang out in the main men's toilet

1257
01:25:17,074 --> 01:25:19,840
while everyone else
is using the urinal

1258
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,509
and that can be a bit weird.

1259
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:24,934
But because I have my prosthesis

1260
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:26,671
then I just get on with it.

1261
01:25:28,505 --> 01:25:30,577
They're not as clean as
the female toilets,

1262
01:25:30,602 --> 01:25:31,673
generally speaking.

1263
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:33,854
It's a prosthesis

1264
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,481
and it's actually a device

1265
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:39,072
for people with female genitals

1266
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:40,896
to piss standing up.

1267
01:25:40,921 --> 01:25:42,659
So it's a sort of a funnel

1268
01:25:43,344 --> 01:25:45,721
and it's called a pisser-packer

1269
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:49,503
because it's nice and soft silicon

1270
01:25:49,528 --> 01:25:51,861
so you can actually put it
in your underpants

1271
01:25:51,886 --> 01:25:53,587
and keep it there

1272
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:55,714
for when you need to go.

1273
01:25:58,744 --> 01:25:59,938
Just start the game.

1274
01:26:04,193 --> 01:26:07,584
I think it's Orlan who says
"My body is my software".

1275
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,351
I would say that mine
is actually my hardware.

1276
01:26:12,118 --> 01:26:14,753
It is like a complete reprogramming.

1277
01:26:15,268 --> 01:26:17,858
I'm a sculptor
so I'm used to transforming matter

1278
01:26:17,883 --> 01:26:22,026
but of course my own human body

1279
01:26:22,051 --> 01:26:24,017
is another matter, entirely.

1280
01:26:25,934 --> 01:26:27,809
I have a cyborg identity.

1281
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:32,561
I will consider myself a cyborg
but as I am a human being...

1282
01:26:33,678 --> 01:26:37,733
I mean there are so many
plurals of identity.

1283
01:26:39,615 --> 01:26:42,051
A cyborg is somebody who's...

1284
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:47,251
using that sort of the consciousness

1285
01:26:47,276 --> 01:26:49,584
of machines and prosthetics,

1286
01:26:49,609 --> 01:26:51,928
using machines
as a prosthetic as well.

1287
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:57,240
Just their identity isn't confined
to their own human body.

1288
01:26:57,265 --> 01:27:01,955
It's something to do with
a broader consciousness of the self.

1289
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:11,570
Am I just a cyborg when I'm  online?

1290
01:27:12,062 --> 01:27:14,742
If I'm gardening, am I a cyborg?

1291
01:27:18,986 --> 01:27:20,944
Would you do a phalloplastic?

1292
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:24,693
If you would have
a functioning cock.

1293
01:27:25,548 --> 01:27:28,218
What would you do with your cunt?

1294
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,308
Oh, I'd leave the cunt. Definitely.

1295
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:35,117
I don't know what
I'd do with my breasts though.

1296
01:27:35,142 --> 01:27:37,269
No, I know.
I would change them a little bit.

1297
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:39,565
I would become a hermaphrodite.

1298
01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:45,428
You can actually grow
from a cell of your body,

1299
01:27:45,453 --> 01:27:46,553
you can grow a dick.

1300
01:27:47,616 --> 01:27:50,366
Maybe not nowadays,
but soon, very soon.

1301
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:52,024
<i>Yeah. I mean I don't know.</i>

1302
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:56,761
<i>I always wanted the genitals
I have now, so I'm quite happy.</i>

1303
01:27:56,786 --> 01:27:57,906
You're quite happy.

1304
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:07,016
I think it would be wrong to assume

1305
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:09,530
that it's like a group of people

1306
01:28:09,555 --> 01:28:12,166
all shooting up testosterone together.

1307
01:28:12,191 --> 01:28:13,154
That's a kind of...

1308
01:28:13,179 --> 01:28:17,340
tabloid fear mongering way
of putting it,

1309
01:28:17,365 --> 01:28:20,701
because we all did come to
our individual decisions.

1310
01:28:20,726 --> 01:28:24,758
And we all were going through
the experience alone.

[chattering]

1312
01:28:36,633 --> 01:28:40,578

of family in that sense,

[eastern music]

1321
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:21,916
In a sari it’s good
to have a bit of flesh.

1322
01:29:21,941 --> 01:29:24,312
Right, that's considered sexy.

1323
01:29:26,631 --> 01:29:28,653
I've always wanted a sari

1324
01:29:28,678 --> 01:29:30,446
and I like to do female drag

1325
01:29:30,471 --> 01:29:33,360
so I thought I'd work on
a few different outfits.

1326
01:29:34,645 --> 01:29:36,820
If you don't mind,
if you're patient with me,

1327
01:29:36,845 --> 01:29:38,455
I'm gonna try and see
if I can remember

1328
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,628
what you told me
and you're helping me.

1329
01:29:46,217 --> 01:29:48,034
Just put it on heavy.

1330
01:29:48,059 --> 01:29:50,487
Pour it on,
be a bit exaggerated.

1331
01:29:50,512 --> 01:29:53,294
You're being a bit too subtle,
give it to me.

I'll do the mascara, ok?

- Yes, ok.

[breaking waves]

1374
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:18,821
The reason I became a photographer

1375
01:33:18,846 --> 01:33:21,496
is I never ever saw my world,

1376
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:26,508
my reality reflected
in an accurate and beautiful way.

1377
01:33:26,533 --> 01:33:30,252
This picture is a wider shot.

1378
01:33:32,688 --> 01:33:35,822
This was the centre piece
of the grid of nine

1379
01:33:35,847 --> 01:33:38,038
and it's called <i>Hermaphrodite torso</i>.

1380
01:33:41,304 --> 01:33:42,983
When I take a picture of someone

1381
01:33:43,008 --> 01:33:46,201
it's almost as
if they become part of me.

1382
01:33:50,392 --> 01:33:53,225
I don't consider that
I have a clitoris anymore.

1383
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,661
I call it a 'dick clit'.

1384
01:33:55,161 --> 01:33:57,271
A cross between a dick and a clit.

1385
01:33:57,296 --> 01:33:58,806
So it is a 'dick clit',

1386
01:33:58,831 --> 01:34:01,014
because it is small.

1387
01:34:01,764 --> 01:34:03,814
But that is exactly what I wanted.

1388
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:12,219
Women were raised to feel
ashamed of their bodies.

1389
01:34:12,244 --> 01:34:15,025
Particularly, their genitals.

1390
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:18,190
Women don't have
a lot of pride in their genitals.

1391
01:34:18,215 --> 01:34:20,378
Probably because of the way in which

1392
01:34:20,403 --> 01:34:22,918
they have been portrayed
in pornography,

1393
01:34:24,949 --> 01:34:29,123
in very invasive, intrusive,
ugly ways.

1394
01:34:29,148 --> 01:34:31,794
So I wanted to make my genitals

1395
01:34:31,819 --> 01:34:34,153
and other people's genitals look good.

1396
01:34:36,934 --> 01:34:38,202
This is another one...

1397
01:34:41,335 --> 01:34:44,969
I think some people might think
that it's quite shocking.

1398
01:34:44,994 --> 01:34:48,178
I find them really stunningly beautiful.

1399
01:34:50,248 --> 01:34:52,692
But I'm the first to admit

1400
01:34:52,717 --> 01:34:56,400
I'm out of touch with what
the person on the street

1401
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:58,054
might think or feel.

1402
01:34:58,978 --> 01:35:01,746
I'm not so worried about
what people think of me

1403
01:35:01,771 --> 01:35:05,969
and because I'm surrounded by people
that I respect and admire

1404
01:35:05,994 --> 01:35:09,003
who I hope respect and admire me,

1405
01:35:09,028 --> 01:35:12,961
I'm really... that birthday thing.

1406
01:35:12,986 --> 01:35:14,503
I'm gonna start crying again,

1407
01:35:14,528 --> 01:35:16,771
cause the birthday thing was just...

1408
01:35:19,248 --> 01:35:23,401
Having felt so unpopular
in junior high school.

1409
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:26,192
And feeling like
people really didn't like me

1410
01:35:26,217 --> 01:35:28,303
and then to have

1411
01:35:28,328 --> 01:35:31,507
all my friends get me
that beautiful bicycle.

1412
01:35:33,264 --> 01:35:36,505
It just made me feel so good
and so loved.

1413
01:35:37,276 --> 01:35:40,766
I'm really, really lucky to have that.

1414
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:45,364
Anyway.

1415
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:06,048
<i>Mo B. Dick: Tonight is a legendary night.</i>

1416
01:36:06,073 --> 01:36:09,527
<i>Not all these drag kings have been
on the same stage all at once,</i>

1417
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:13,281
<i>This fellow came all the way from London.</i>

1418
01:36:13,306 --> 01:36:14,820
All right. Yeah, ok.

1419
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:20,759
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a warm round of applause

1420
01:36:20,784 --> 01:36:24,601
for Del LaGrace Volcano.

1421
01:36:25,163 --> 01:36:26,283
[music]

1422
01:37:08,914 --> 01:37:10,275
I like myself

1423
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:13,965
and having come from
really hating myself

1424
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:16,313
and having a really bad self-image,

1425
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:19,540
it's important to me now
to have a good self-image

1426
01:37:19,565 --> 01:37:24,329
and I guess in a way to show people
that you can make that transition.

1427
01:37:29,656 --> 01:37:31,093
[music]

1428
01:37:55,877 --> 01:37:57,886
Be what you gotta be,
be who you wanna be,

1429
01:37:57,911 --> 01:37:59,805
you can't let what people
are gonna say,

1430
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:01,583
what people are gonna
think about you,

1431
01:38:01,608 --> 01:38:03,780
get in the way,
you just gotta live it.

1432
01:38:04,483 --> 01:38:05,603
[music]

1433
01:38:25,082 --> 01:38:26,482
[cheering]

1434
01:38:45,532 --> 01:38:47,994
Ladies and gentlemen:
Dréd and Luscious.

1435
01:38:48,149 --> 01:38:49,976
Luscious get out here.

1436
01:38:50,486 --> 01:38:52,053
Hooooooly shit.

1437
01:38:52,626 --> 01:38:54,244
Oh my god, Luscious and Dréd.

1438
01:38:55,776 --> 01:38:57,176
Oh shit!

1439
01:38:59,073 --> 01:39:00,193
[music]

1440
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,222
[Song]
["This is a Man's Man's Man's World"]

1441
01:39:47,238 --> 01:39:48,638
[big cheering]

1442
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:51,321
[lyrics: This is a man's world...]

1443
01:39:53,293 --> 01:39:55,708
[...but it would be nothing...]

1444
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:59,551
[...without a woman.]

1445
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:02,691
[clapping]

1446
01:40:08,251 --> 01:40:10,029
Drag kingdom has come.

1447
01:40:11,771 --> 01:40:13,410
Can I hear an amen?

1448
01:40:15,152 --> 01:40:18,281
Reverend Jimmy Johnson,
I'm a heterosexual

1449
01:40:18,306 --> 01:40:21,591
and I wanna be a part
of your drag kingdom,

1450
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:25,835
and what do you think I say?

1451
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,717
I say amen to heterosexuals,

1452
01:40:28,742 --> 01:40:31,249
I say amen to homosexuals,

1453
01:40:31,274 --> 01:40:33,771
I say amen to bisexuals,

1454
01:40:33,796 --> 01:40:36,377
I say amen to transsexuals.

1455
01:40:37,822 --> 01:40:42,090
I say amen to anybody's sexual.

1456
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:44,656
[cheering and clapping]

1457
01:40:45,698 --> 01:40:48,498
