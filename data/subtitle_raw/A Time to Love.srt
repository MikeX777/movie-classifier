1
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,513
Stone, scissors, paper.

2
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,056
Stone, scissors, paper.

3
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,391
Stone, scissors, paper.

4
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,499
Qu Ran, go!

5
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,127
Stone, scissors, paper.

6
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,735
Go!

7
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,467
Stone, scissors, paper.

8
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,173
Qu Ran, go!

9
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,681
Stone, scissors, paper.

10
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,818
Stone, scissors, paper.

11
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,889
This was the courtyard of our neighborhood

12
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,458
And these were our happy days in the '70s

13
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,131
Qu Ran was the prettiest girl in the neighborhood

14
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,628
Every boy wanted to be on his best when she's
around

15
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,000
I of course was no exception

16
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,307
I won

17
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,530
You cheated

18
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,474
You cheated

19
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:30,945
Stand there! Stop! Get him!

20
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,383
Stand there! Stop!

21
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,555
Get him!

22
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,074
I won't cheat again

23
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,245
Let go of me please. I won't cheat again.

24
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,277
Hou Jia, I won't cheat again. Please let go of me

25
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,912
Hou Jia, go see your father

26
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,385
Go see your father

27
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,124
Hou Jia was the head boy of our neighborhood

28
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,530
We went to the same kindergarten, grade school and

29
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,462
I didn't know what happened in his family that day

30
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,572
But all of a sudden I felt a sadness.

31
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,106
It's because I was afraid,
and also because ofHou Jia

32
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:35,771
Mom

33
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,709
Mom, are you okay?

34
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,213
Mom, get up

35
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,607
You came fifth! That's something!

36
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,909
What are you doing?

37
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,518
I am your cohort in crime

38
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,865
Let's go

39
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,443
All the boys adored Qu Ran. She had that quality.

40
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,907
But she only liked me

41
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,849
Every time I rode past my school mates with her on
my back.

42
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,914
I just felt so great.

43
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,481
She's always talking non-stop.

44
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,981
Sometimes..

45
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,117
I really didn't hear what she was saying.

46
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,059
I just felt that she was very happy

47
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,924
Hou Jia has always been nice to me since we were
children

48
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,536
But as we grew up, that feeling changed.

49
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,570
It's become somewhat ambiguous and uncertain.

50
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,402
Back then I really liked to go to school

51
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,379
Because I wanted to see him.

52
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,343
And I knew when I looked at him

53
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,111
He'd be looking at me

54
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,751
Don't say anything

55
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,026
I know it. You haven't done it.

56
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:10,095
Why is it so hard to get my medical bills
reimburse?

57
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,729
I'm giving up

58
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,973
My lips are coarse from reminding you

59
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,465
How many times have I told you?

60
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,570
You tell me, how many times?

61
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,973
Every time you make me worry.
Then there's my salary

62
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,776
Easy on the salt.

63
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,518
You don't even go pick up my salary

64
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,284
How are we going to survive without my salary?

65
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,552
Such a simple thing, why is it so difficult?

66
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,821
Mom, I'll go when I have time. Stop bugging me

67
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,391
What else can I do besides bugging you?

68
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,256
I'm home

69
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,534
Mom, I'm home

70
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,269
You're late again.

71
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,813
But never as late as dad.

72
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,840
Mom, where's my brother?

73
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,583
He went to see a soccer game with some friends

74
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,848
Hey, have one

75
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,144
Wash your hands

76
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,623
So people go to college to watch soccer games.

77
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,654
I wish I could start college tomorrow

78
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,295
You're pretty confident, aren't you?

79
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,091
Look at your grades

80
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,736
You have your father and I worry sick over them

81
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,974
Relax.

82
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,209
I'm great playing catch up.

83
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,810
Ranran, what is Hou Jia's exercise book
doing on your desk?

84
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,976
We're friends, and friends help each other out.

85
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,748
Why him? Don't you have other friends?

86
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,652
We live in the same building.

87
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:19,088
And he's the best student in math, physics and
chemistry in our class

88
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:23,163
He's so smart. It's amazing.
Even the teacher don't understand

89
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,165
Mom, how come he's so smart?

90
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,865
I'm telling you, keep your mind on your studies.

91
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,203
I always keep my mind on my studies.

92
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,234
What's for dinner?

93
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,368
Dad, you're back.

94
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,546
Brother went to a soccer game

95
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,072
We're just waiting for you.

96
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,306
No, don't wait for me again

97
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,047
Ranran's busy, let her eat first.

98
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,680
I can get the water.

99
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,236
I've counted it. You can count it again.

100
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,774
Both your mom's salary and medical bill
reimbursements are here

101
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,135
Thank you.

102
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,581
I hate going to my mom's office.

103
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,910
Don't worry. I can go for you.

104
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,481
Let me.

105
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,293
Hou Jia, is Dong Da your first choice?

106
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,254
Of course.

107
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,028
What happens ifl don't get into Dong Da?

108
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,803
You want to apply to Dong Da? You're dreaming!

109
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,485
Then I'm not applying to Dong Da.

110
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,187
I'll apply to a second-tiered school with you.

111
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,755
You'll be brilliant there.

112
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,725
Whatever. "Dong Da" is definitely
my first choice anyways.

113
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,261
Mom.

114
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,230
I'm home.

115
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,310
Let's have noodles. Noodles are quick.

116
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,212
I've already eaten, you go ahead.

117
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,281
Mom, you're upset.

118
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,213
I'm late coming home because
I went to get your reimbursement.

119
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:32,129
I know. Xiao Ma from the union told me
when he came with the rice.

120
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,766
The money's here. Count it.

121
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,003
Put it over there. Did you hand in
your college entrance exam form?

122
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,910
Yes, and like we agreed,
I didn't apply to an out-of-town school.

123
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,449
Actually you should apply to a couple of them.

124
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,185
Like Beijing and Shanghai.
I'm sure they will accept you.

125
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,615
I'm going to the bathroom.

126
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,486
I'm not applying to an out-of-town school.

127
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,292
How will you manage ifl were gone?

128
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,564
I can find a maid or go to an old people's home.

129
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,032
Or I can go with you.

130
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,131
I've had quite enough with the building.

131
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:31,186
Where're you going? You should be studying,
there's no much time left.

132
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,355
You're asking me? Where are you going?

133
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,429
I can't study anymore. I'm going crazy.

134
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,656
I want to go to the examination hall.

135
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,665
I don't want us to get lost and
be late on that day.

136
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,060
Us?

137
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,566
I'll come to get you and we go together.

138
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,734
My dad said he's taking me.

139
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:04,082
But he's not picking me up, we can come back
together.

140
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,047
Right? Right?

141
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,539
The college entrance exam came and went.

142
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,580
Hou Jia came first in our school and second in our
district.

143
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,884
I did so-so and could only get into a branch
campus.

144
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,583
As we waited for our admissions notice to arrive...

145
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,128
We did all sorts of things to relax.

146
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,656
It looked like we wanted high school to go on
forever.

147
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,998
The truth was we didn't want to part.

148
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,836
It's agreed. We go to the countryside
when we get our admissions notice.

149
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,381
Mom.

150
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,094
Mom, I got into "Dong Da".

151
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,065
Mom, you're upset.

152
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,437
I know you will.

153
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,777
Mom, where're you going?

154
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,071
To the office to get my salary.

155
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,543
Take me downstairs.

156
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,984
I'm going tomorrow. I promise.

157
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,490
I'm going out for a minute, I'll be right back.

158
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,781
Didn't you hear me?

159
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,194
Take me downstairs.

160
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,799
Mom, what's the matter with you?

161
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,328
All my friends' parents are so happy
that their children get into college.

162
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,237
Everyone's celebrating.
What's the matter with you?

163
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,301
Hou Jia.

164
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,771
You're different.

165
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,172
Your father...

166
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,014
Committed suicide.

167
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,423
I never told you because I was afraid it'd affect
your education.

168
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,829
And I'm suffocating to death for it.

169
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,100
You're going to college.

170
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,259
You'll have friends...

171
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,198
From all over the country.

172
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,502
You can make friends...

173
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,936
With whomever you want.

174
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,810
I don't have an opinion.

175
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,345
And if you want to leave this town...

176
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,511
I can go with you.

177
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,516
Mom.

178
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,787
What are you trying to tell me? What is it?

179
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,498
You can't go out with Qu Ran.

180
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,496
Why?

181
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,487
Why isn't he here yet?

182
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,572
Qu Ran, what's the matter with Hou Jia?

183
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:44,865
I don't know.

184
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,137
I told him three times that we're meeting at six.

185
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,504
He didn't change his mind, did he?

186
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,449
If something had happened, he'd have told me.

187
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,328
You're home.

188
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,396
You haven't forgotten, have you?

189
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,097
What is it?

190
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,834
Is your mom all right?

191
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,877
Are you okay?

192
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,088
I'm fine. I just don't want to go.

193
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,389
Then who are you upset with?

194
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,896
Don't ask, just go.

195
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,424
Go where?

196
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,702
I don't care. Just don't come to me again.

197
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:48,830
Why?

198
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,834
You asked me why?

199
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,669
Why don't you ask you father?

200
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,777
Ask him what he did to my family.

201
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,808
You should turn in early.

202
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,918
I never saw my mom got so angry.

203
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,865
It's been ages and I didn't remember much about my
father's death.

204
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,068
But to my mother, it's always been a curse.

205
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,842
I just can't believe that Qu Ran was involved.

206
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,911
Not to say figuring a way to deal with it.

207
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,603
I just know...

208
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,514
Qu Ran would be so heart broken.

209
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,698
Brother, can I ask you something?

210
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,907
Can't you see I'm busy?

211
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,439
One quick question.

212
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,537
Shoot.

213
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,010
Hou Jia's father, I mean...

214
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,584
How did he die?

215
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,013
Who's Hou Jia?

216
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:01,623
He lives downstairs. We're in the same grade.

217
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,194
When he was in junior 5, the police arrested
his father and h killed himself.

218
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,830
That's ancient history. So?

219
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,568
Does father have anything to do with it?

220
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,871
That's ridiculous. Says who?

221
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,473
His mom forbids him to go out with me.

222
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,475
Why do you want to go out with him?
Who the hell is he anyway?

223
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,191
Son.

224
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,333
Are you thinking of getting a new bike?

225
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,870
Get something nice.

226
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,743
After all it's "Dong Da".

227
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,569
I've been asking around.

228
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,113
In our neighborhood...

229
00:21:58,583 --> 00:21:59,641
You're the only one...

230
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,054
I've asked Auntie Wang to find me a maid.

231
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,591
It's 50 yuan a month, plus room and board.

232
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,959
You just concentrate on your studies
and don't worry about me.

233
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,733
What's that supposed to mean?

234
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,832
Hou Jia.

235
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,202
Are you pushing me around because
I don't have anyone to talk to?

236
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,171
Then tell me what happened.

237
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,115
What else do you want to know?.

238
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:43,354
Your father died and left us
to fend for ourselves, isn't that enough?

239
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,223
But what does it have to do with Qu Ran?

240
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,762
You are such a loser.

241
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,036
Mom.

242
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,744
You scolded me.

243
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,451
The greatest satisfaction...

244
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,088
Of my life,

245
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,490
Is that both of you...

246
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,663
My two children...

247
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,366
Are going to university.

248
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,004
One in the arts, and one in the sciences.

249
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,039
Your mother and l...

250
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,639
Will never stand in your way,

251
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:42,951
But only do our very best to help you.

252
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,081
That's what we did...

253
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,726
And that's how we'll continue.

254
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,796
As for Qu Ran's question,

255
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,696
My answer is:

256
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,635
I have never framed or hurt anyone.

257
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:07,271
Not in the past, not in the present...

258
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,809
And never in the future.

259
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,008
Then why did Hou Jia's father kill himself?.

260
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,256
That's a matter for grown-ups. It's none of your
business...

261
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,449
And I don't need to discuss it with you.

262
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,897
All right. It's settled. Let's eat.

263
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,365
Come. Let's eat our dinner.

264
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,731
Don't bring it up again.

265
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,962
Let's eat.

266
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,365
Since you don't want to come clean with it...

267
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,798
Then you must be hiding something.

268
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,872
Ranran.

269
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:48,479
That's no way to talk to your father.
You're going too far.

270
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,618
Starting today,

271
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,652
If that Hou Jia came to see you again...

272
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,123
You just slap his face.

273
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:48,730
Hou Jia.

274
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,935
If...

275
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,147
My family ever did anything to hurt your parents,

276
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,052
I can apologize to your family...

277
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,716
On their behalf.

278
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,658
My father didn't want an apology.

279
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,096
He's dead.

280
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,631
My father said he hadn't done anything.

281
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,371
No, he had.

282
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,770
Hou Jia.

283
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,273
But I haven't.

284
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,716
I know.

285
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,312
But...

286
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,552
Ranran.

287
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,589
How can you do this to us?

288
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,696
Are you going to eat your meals
in your room for the rest of your life?

289
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,634
Unless you tell me...

290
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,470
What that was all about.

291
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,533
It was perhaps...

292
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,977
Qu Ran's apology...

293
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,545
That made me realize
I was probably in love with her.

294
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,377
I wanted to get away from her.

295
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,012
I was afraid of seeing her,

296
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,350
But I was really waiting for her.

297
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,886
If not...

298
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,153
Why does Cupid hold in his hands...

299
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,965
Not roses...

300
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,990
But bow and arrows?

301
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,030
Only when you love someone...

302
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,768
Will you behave like that.

303
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,871
I don't hate Hou Jia.

304
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,069
And I don't hate my parents.

305
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,475
At that time I just didn't understand...

306
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,383
Why is it that the people who tortured me most...

307
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,549
Were those that I loved most dearly.

308
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,922
I started college with that question in my heart.

309
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,071
Qu Ran, let me give you a ride.
You're running late.

310
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,272
Why do you always look so unhappy?

311
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:55,616
I'm okay. It's just that college life
isn't exactly what I imagined.

312
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,543
Join us. Let's go out and have some fun.

313
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,552
I guarantee you'll be so happy.
That's what we do best.

314
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,052
I don't fancy skipping classes like you guys.

315
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,623
Of course you shouldn't make it a habit.

316
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,463
Never, not even once

317
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,988
But it's also a regret...

318
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,595
I have never been late for school in my life.

319
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,088
Everyone knows the story ofRomeo and Juliet.

320
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,359
But that was the first time that
I read the entire play.

321
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,502
Their love moved me to the deep.

322
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,336
And our experience was so much like theirs.

323
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,547
The play was to me like a beacon.

324
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,401
Sun Yifan.

325
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,436
Here.

326
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,448
Li Chuanzi.

327
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,471
Here.

328
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,006
Wang Song.

329
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,040
Here.

330
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,745
Qu Ran.

331
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,720
She's not here.

332
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,145
Lu Baocai.

333
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,180
Here.

334
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:16,582
Zhao Pengjing.

335
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,616
Here.

336
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:17,810
So this is the play.

337
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:50,353
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

338
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,618
Thou art thyself,

339
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,122
Though not a Montague.

340
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:00,428
What's a Montague?

341
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,562
It is not hand, nor foot,

342
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,497
Nor arm, nor face,

343
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,803
Nor an other part belonging to a man.

344
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,376
O, be some other name!

345
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,739
What's in a name?

346
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,305
That which we call a rose

347
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:23,184
By any other name would smell as sweet.

348
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,622
So Romeo would, would he not Romeo call'd,

349
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:30,760
Retain that dear perfection which he owes

350
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,994
Without that title. Romeo, doffthy name,

351
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,468
And for that name which is no part ofthee

352
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,862
Take all myself.

353
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,005
My name, dear saint,

354
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,976
Is hateful to myself

355
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,541
Because it is an enemy to thee;

356
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,873
Had I it written,

357
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,950
I would tear the word.

358
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:06,423
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

359
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,498
But, soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?

360
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,933
It is the east,

361
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,568
And Juliet is the sun.

362
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,871
The play seems to have been written for us.

363
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,347
It's waited for us for several hundred years.

364
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,086
You mean...

365
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,792
We must persist. Is that right?

366
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,656
Eat.

367
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:44,924
What about you?

368
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,561
I'll eat at the canteen.

369
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,406
C'mon, eat with me.

370
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,475
Those were our happiest days.

371
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,468
We stayed out of our families' ways.

372
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,177
And we didn't think about the future.

373
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:03,309
We were in love and
we wanted to be together forever.

374
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:07,215
We wanted to prove that children
of feuding families can get together.

375
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,119
And their union can resolve hatred.

376
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,591
Qu Ran always said,

377
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,334
Ifwe were to give up our love
for our fathers' quarrels,

378
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:24,136
Then we're no different from Romeo and Juliet,

379
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,637
For death ofthe heart is just
as sad as death ofthe body.

380
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:43,216
Watching the gently falling rain...

381
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:46,555
Ah, walking in the rain. Isn't that romantic?

382
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:53,226
Beautiful rain, how I love this precious rain.

383
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,260
Let me give you a ride.

384
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,228
Why don' you teach me?

385
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,329
Sure.

386
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,819
Look straight ahead. I'm going to push you.

387
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,213
Hey, slowly.

388
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,194
Hold me, and don't let go.

389
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,866
C'mon, go.

390
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,974
Xiao Lan.

391
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,349
Xiao Lan.

392
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,826
Xiao Lan, Hou Jia.

393
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,498
Hou Jia.

394
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,274
I'm giving you a push.

395
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,164
Have some water.

396
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,301
Thank you.

397
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,600
Mom.

398
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,571
This is Li Zinan, your brother's girlfriend.

399
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,344
How do you do?

400
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,510
How do you do?

401
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,611
I'm Qu Ran. Welcome to our home.

402
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,981
Oh, both the girl and the boy are here.

403
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,982
It's a happy occasion.

404
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,117
Sit down.

405
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,151
Don't stand up.

406
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,103
Ranran.

407
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,844
Here. Let me.

408
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,313
Please don't eat in your room this evening.

409
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,486
Look how happy your father is.

410
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,225
We don't want people to laugh at us, do we?

411
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,389
Mom, don't worry. I understand.

412
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,305
Qu Qiang. I lost one of my stockings.
I just washed them.

413
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:51,763
It must have fallen downstairs.

414
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,165
That's my only pair.

415
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,674
Qu Qiang, go look for it.

416
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:57,436
I go over there.

417
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:02,284
Ranran, lend her a pair of yours.

418
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,549
But I don't have any long stockings.

419
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,445
Have a candy.

420
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,479
What about my stockings?

421
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,387
They are a present from my aunt in America.

422
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:11,686
It's not here.

423
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,096
It's over there hanging on
your classmate's window.

424
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,395
I'll get it for you.

425
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,508
Hou Jia.

426
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:45,392
Hi. I think we dropped something on your window,

427
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,021
May I go inside and have a look?

428
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,556
Sure.

429
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,294
Thank you.

430
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,999
Our family does not have anything that belongs to
your family.

431
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,100
Mrs. Hou, is Hou Jia home?

432
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,810
Is that any ofyour business
whether he's home or not?

433
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,977
Our family does not have anything that
belongs to your family.

434
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,484
Mrs. Hou.

435
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,181
Qu Ran.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

436
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,390
Qu Ran.

437
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:25,960
My mother, she...

438
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,866
Are you okay?

439
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,313
Qu Ran.

440
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,168
Come, let's eat.

441
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:23,082
Enjoy the dishes. Eat.

442
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,623
Eat.

443
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:45,544
Hou Jia, you are not keeping your promise.

444
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,720
You're still seeing Qu Ran.

445
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,722
Don't think that I don't know.

446
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,285
You should really tell me the whole truth.

447
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,528
Tell me what actually happened.

448
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,976
Mr. and Mrs. Qu, I should be going.

449
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,200
Have a little more.

450
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,268
I'm quite full already.

451
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,308
See her off.

452
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,342
No, please don't.

453
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:55,243
You didn't give your brother face,
and you didn't give us face.

454
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,281
Dad,

455
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,131
Ifwe'd really done something terrible
to the Hou family...

456
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,530
Could I apologize to them?

457
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,539
I don't think it's fair that...

458
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,575
We should bear your burdens.

459
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,436
Ranran.

460
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,773
I'm telling you again.

461
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:32,118
I've never done anything against my principles or
conscience.

462
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,590
I don't owe anyone an apology.

463
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,831
As for the question ofyour emotional
involvements,

464
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,622
I'm sure...

465
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,063
You are capable ofhandling them.

466
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,596
You are so smart...

467
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,874
In so many things.

468
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:59,312
You will have a bright future.

469
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,140
However...

470
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,978
If you spend too much energy on these things,

471
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,649
You'll end up despising yourself.

472
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,695
But you still haven't told me...

473
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,561
What actually happened.

474
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,801
Were you in any way involved...

475
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,134
In Hou Jia's father's death?

476
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:36,842
Someone read...

477
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:41,390
The letter that Qu Zhiheng wrote
to frame your father.

478
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:46,526
They were squabbling over a position, and he
framed your dad.

479
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:52,434
Your father was arrested and he killed himself,
and Qu got the position.

480
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,461
What did he accuse father of?.

481
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,269
Was there no investigation into it?

482
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,409
What're the results?

483
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,617
I'm an adult now. You got to tell me the truth.

484
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:15,384
What's the purpose? You father died.
You won't forget it, will you?

485
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,094
But what does it have to do with Qu Ran?

486
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,727
That's something between you adults.

487
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,628
You're not to marry her
even if she's the last woman on earth.

488
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,644
Don't even think about it.

489
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:17,144
Not even over my dead body.

490
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,249
Uncle Qu.

491
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,558
I've always had a lot of respect for you.

492
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,602
That time we went on a field trip.
You came to pick up Qu Ran...

493
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:12,435
And ended up collecting all the kids
from our building.

494
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:18,943
The six of us crowded into the back ofyour car.
It was so much fun.

495
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,377
I'd like to know...

496
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,151
What happened...

497
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,357
Between our families.

498
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,659
Could you please tell me?

499
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,058
Hou Jia.

500
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,195
You don't have the right to ask me this question.

501
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,241
And I am under no obligation to answer it.

502
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,466
If...

503
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:55,379
you don't want her to be sad or get hurt,

504
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,753
You put an end to your relationship.

505
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:04,355
That's what a man should do.

506
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,913
First we go to Beidaihe, then Shanhaiguan...

507
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,484
Visit the GreatWall from the other side
and come back from Gubeikou.

508
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,187
Not bad. Sounds like a terrific trip.

509
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,299
I get sentimental when I'm by the sea.

510
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,691
I'll miss you.

511
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:52,432
I'll miss you too. You've brought so much joy
to my college life.

512
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:01,016
Hou Jia, what are you doing here?

513
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,276
This book here...

514
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,284
Came from your school library.

515
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,259
I should be returning it. You're graduating.

516
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,429
I already paid the fine.
It's five times the original price.

517
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:16,721
Let's go.

518
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:22,660
Qu Ran.

519
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,429
Who is he?

520
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,469
He's from the same class and the same department.

521
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,739
We've been friends
and now we have to say good-bye.

522
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,814
I've returned all the love letters...

523
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,618
To their authors in person.

524
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,552
They called me a stiff.

525
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,246
I'm not like you.

526
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,916
Hou Jia, what's the matter with you?

527
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:50,126
You came here to tell me that?
I haven't seen you in ages.

528
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:56,163
Do you know how much I miss you
and think about you?

529
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,578
It's the film...

530
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,652
Romeo and Juliet.

531
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:43,677
Our experience decided our hobby.

532
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:47,479
We became big fans of Shakespeare,

533
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:52,819
Especially the different interpretations
ofRomeo and Juliet.

534
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:58,163
Theater, opera, books, stills, etc.

535
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,830
Every time we looked at the two protagonists...

536
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,396
We thought we were looking at ourselves.

537
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,135
When we found ourselves losing
all sense of directions...

538
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,772
We always turned to the play
to look for each other.

539
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,025
Qu Ran.

540
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,237
Let's just keep walking...

541
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,430
To another city,

542
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,809
And never come back.

543
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:44,480
Let's ask for a transfer to another area.

544
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:48,081
I'll follow you wherever you go,

545
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,209
To a place where no one knows us...

546
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,985
And where we don't need anyone.

547
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,649
So long as we can be together.

548
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,789
There are so many places that we can go to.

549
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,086
Where do you want to go?

550
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:03,888
To Shanghai.

551
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,989
To Beijing.

552
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,798
To Dalian.

553
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:07,825
To Guangzhou.

554
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,670
Let's go to the south.

555
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,142
Ifyou gave up your work here
and went to another town with me,

556
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,605
Your family will hate me.

557
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,080
Hou Jia, please keep your promise.

558
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,609
I'm so afraid that you won't keep it.

559
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,482
Like Zijun in Lu Xun's story Sad Departing.

560
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,220
You should have a wonderful life,
but I can't bring you happiness.

561
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,625
How do you know I won't be happy?

562
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,632
We cannot give up our family.

563
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,730
And we cannot change ourselves.

564
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,463
Hou Jia.

565
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:50,443
Even if we'd fight, break up, regret and die...

566
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,317
Right this minute I want to go with you.

567
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:25,903
Mom...

568
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,538
I think...

569
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,975
I want to find a job elsewhere.

570
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,222
No, we don't agree.

571
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:37,960
Mom, just think that you'd never
had me for a daughter.

572
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:43,864
You can give up your parents,
but I won't let you throw your life away.

573
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,130
Mom, what do you want me to do then?

574
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:50,367
You're an adult, you should know.

575
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,398
You have to make a choice...

576
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,670
Between Qu Ran and l.

577
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,044
If you want me to go with you, that's fine.

578
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,139
But if you choose Qu Ran...

579
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,917
I'll go join your father.

580
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:06,312
Mom, what are you doing?

581
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,557
I'm going to your school,

582
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,850
and I'm talking to your school authorities.

583
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:11,883
Mom.

584
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,628
Talk to anyone you want.

585
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,594
I'm not going even if it's the best unit.

586
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,092
Then I also tell you,
you are not going to have your way.

587
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,296
Mom.

588
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,880
The story on the stage does not change.

589
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,975
But the story of our life gets re-written
over and over again.

590
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:12,816
Hou Jia asked me...

591
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:18,089
Is giving up life or giving up hope more horrible?

592
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:23,696
I knew what he meant.
I've always thought about that myself.

593
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:27,434
I even thought...

594
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,102
Perhaps that's another kind of happiness.

595
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,696
No.

596
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,705
I won't let you die.

597
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:23,555
There's peace after death,
and people can stop hurting each other.

598
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,484
Here?

599
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:59,033
Ranran, what happened?
Ranran, say something.

600
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,626
Ranran, Quiet, quiet

601
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,327
Ranran

602
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:03,963
Whose parents are you?

603
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,406
The name's Qu.

604
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:09,574
What's going on?

605
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:10,943
Sign here.

606
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,105
Please come over here to read the statement.

607
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,328
Ranran, what happened?

608
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,852
He...

609
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,154
Did he...

610
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,825
Did he rape you?

611
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:39,133
After all these years and
you're still using this word...

612
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:42,404
And this time on my son.

613
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,643
How much more do you want to destroy me?

614
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:47,504
Mom.

615
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,883
You go on home. Take the No. 54 bus.

616
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,814
Please read the statement.

617
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,032
Ranran.

618
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,675
Did Hou Jia rape you?

619
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,874
Qu Ran, I want to hear you say it.

620
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,275
Mrs. Hou...

621
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,712
I beg you, please don't torture him any more.

622
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,523
I love Hou Jia.

623
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,926
We didn't do anything wrong.

624
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,457
Stop this.

625
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,027
Let's go.

626
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:42,030
Qu Ran will never enter your home...

627
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:44,973
Even if she has to grow old and
die in her own home.

628
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:48,033
Qu Zhiheng, you heard it.

629
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,709
My son did not rape your daughter.

630
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:55,344
You're trying to frame us.

631
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,018
I'm going to the courts...

632
01:05:58,054 --> 01:05:59,146
To sue you.

633
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,145
Hou Jia.

634
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:02,681
We're leaving.

635
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,018
Ranran, let go.

636
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,627
Did you hear me? Let go of your hand.

637
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:12,492
That's enough. You all leave.

638
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:17,302
Get out ofhere. What a mess.

639
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,648
To have that once in a lifetime experience...

640
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,423
Is good enough for me.

641
01:06:56,078 --> 01:07:01,983
Your father became friendly with
a young woman in the office.

642
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,346
At that time I was busy at work and
on a short fuse.

643
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,651
Actually nothing really happened.

644
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,894
But later on there were all these rumors...

645
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,423
About that woman getting pregnant.

646
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:20,895
Qu went to speak with her
on behalf of the organization.

647
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:25,201
In the report he said the woman was raped.

648
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:32,811
Your father was put into custody,
and killed himself before the trial.

649
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,079
Why did he kill himself?.

650
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:39,984
He was too taken by surprise.
He felt betrayed and was desperate.

651
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:42,456
He was betrayed by someone he liked.

652
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,453
Later on I went everywhere looking for that woman.

653
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,290
I wanted to ask her who made her say that.

654
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,069
I never found her;
instead I got into a car accident.

655
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:57,505
Mom, please stop.

656
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,708
I don't enjoy talking about it.

657
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,804
It's not something to be proud of.

658
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:07,175
But you insisted on getting involved with them.

659
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:11,211
How can I put up with that?

660
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:16,514
The reason that I'm still living is you.

661
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:26,861
Your father wronged me.
He's dead and I'm still carrying his burden.

662
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,674
Out ofthe blue Hou Jia decided to go abroad.

663
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,444
For his career and his mother.

664
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:52,253
I was also looking for changes.

665
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:58,497
Separation was painful,
and staying together was also painful.

666
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,332
If not more painful.

667
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,545
Hou Jia, when do you arrive in Beijing tomorrow?.
What time is your flight?

668
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:21,453
I may stay there for one evening.

669
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,618
You're the first person
in our class to go to the US.

670
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:25,824
We'll be right after you.

671
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:28,654
I gave my mom your numbers.
Please take care ofher.

672
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,093
Don't worry, we'll call her.

673
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,912
I don't know what to bring you.

674
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:25,011
They say American food is sweet,
and you may not be used to it.

675
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,656
I really don't want to leave like this.

676
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:39,230
I'm okay. I only want you to be happy.

677
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,035
No matter what happens...

678
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,006
You must let me know.

679
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,413
If there's a way...

680
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,246
I'll send for you.

681
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,132
Don't say anymore.

682
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:16,568
I thought we have an understanding:

683
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:28,306
Nothing will change ifwe don't talk about it.

684
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:35,722
Nothing will ever change
ifwe never say a word about it.

685
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:16,325
The days slipped away quietly in expectation.

686
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:21,967
Father always wore a worried look on his face.

687
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,834
Hou Jia and I wrote furiously to each other.

688
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:27,933
He told me that

689
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:32,907
He'd collected over a dozen editions
ofRomeo and Juliet in different languages.

690
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,246
The days went by, and that was our link.

691
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:41,780
Romeo and Juliet die for their love.

692
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:46,718
We die for our love with each other's solitude.

693
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,090
Thank you.

694
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:55,399
Have some watermelon. Thank you.

695
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:58,162
Cool you off in this hot weather.
That's so true.

696
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:01,631
Mom.

697
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,338
Ranran, look who's here.

698
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:04,534
Ranran.

699
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,569
Mrs. Feng, how are you?

700
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:06,581
How are you?

701
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:11,052
It's been ages. You're all grown up,
and so beautiful.

702
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:14,489
Hey, leave my bag alone.

703
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:20,395
Ranran, Mrs. Feng is here about your business.
Sit down for a while.

704
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,722
Mrs. Feng, please make yourself at home.
I have to work.

705
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:24,460
Sure.

706
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,489
Ranran.

707
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:26,960
I really have to work.

708
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,030
Please sit down.

709
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:31,361
Have some watermelon.

710
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,533
To cool off.

711
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:33,797
Thanks

712
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,835
This watermelon is great. Right.

713
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:39,703
Have some water.

714
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,545
Thank you.

715
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,447
I've brought with me a photograph. Here.

716
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,243
Seoul, scattered showers, 15 to 25 degrees.

717
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:16,810
Beijing, scattered showers to overcast,
12 to 17 degrees.

718
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:32,329
Ranran, Mrs. Feng rode on the bus
for two hours to visit us...

719
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,364
To talk about your business...

720
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,534
And you wouldn't even sit down with her.

721
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,374
I have nothing to say to her.

722
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,846
Mom, it's only clothes for the child,
don't fret over them.

723
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:48,508
He's a fine boy, has a master's degree.

724
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,547
And all his siblings are doing well.

725
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,117
What does it have to do with me?

726
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,794
You're not getting any younger,
when are you going to grow up?

727
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:03,429
We're not obliged to serve you.

728
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,030
You just can't go out and hang yourself on a tree.

729
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:14,172
To hang myself or not, that's my own business.

730
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:16,567
What do you mean that's your own business?

731
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:19,437
Look what you did to our parents!

732
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,641
Look what you did to this family!

733
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,282
When the nanny arrives,
you get ready to move into the sitting room.

734
01:15:27,055 --> 01:15:28,044
Shut up.

735
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:35,563
This is my home, and Ranran will always
have a room in this home.

736
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:41,526
If need be, I move into the sitting room.

737
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:50,270
Mom, eat. I'll make some more.

738
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:59,419
I shouldn't have said that.

739
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:01,713
It's just that...

740
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,488
I worry about you.

741
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:07,886
Brother...

742
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:17,263
How come you can be with the person you love and l
cannot?

743
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:51,795
Ranran...

744
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,074
I'm not asking you to do anything for anyone...

745
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,942
Just for yourself.

746
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,612
Oh...

747
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,388
Not even thirty...

748
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,686
And you already have white hair.

749
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:27,341
Qu Ran, come look at Hou Jia's picture.

750
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:30,905
I just got it in the mail.

751
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:44,992
That's nice.

752
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,377
What about my line to Boston?

753
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,645
We're very busy today, please wait another minute.

754
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:17,118
Line to Paris, booth number 3.

755
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:03,799
The story that begins with
a bang ends with a whimper.

756
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:11,707
For the first time in my life,
I felt lonely, like I've been dumped.

757
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:18,476
I decided to stop contacting Hou Jia,
afraid that he'd confirm that ending...

758
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:23,220
That he'd tell me things that
I didn't want to know.

759
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:47,644
Baobao, say Happy new year to grandparent

760
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,647
As well as auntie. Don't forget!

761
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,615
Baobao, here.

762
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:03,462
She always gives you the biggest red packet.

763
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:07,924
Stop giving him so much money. He's just a kid.

764
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,362
I make my money for him anyway.

765
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:14,365
Baobao, you be nice to Auntie Ranran
when you grow up.

766
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:20,741
When Baobao grows up,
he'll buy a country house for his grandparents.

767
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:23,248
I'll buy one for Auntie Ranran.

768
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:24,274
Buy what?

769
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:25,375
A country house.

770
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:39,382
Let's get one.

771
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:40,654
Why?

772
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:42,763
For Baobao.

773
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,160
I don't think he doesn't want it.

774
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,489
Then I want if for myself.

775
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,464
It's so cute.

776
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:54,640
I want two.

777
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,147
My son said when he had money

778
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:10,384
He'd right away find me an apartment
with an elevator.

779
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,522
I said let's wait until
you came back but he insisted.

780
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:15,193
Where is she moving to?

781
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:16,995
I don't know.

782
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:20,657
Goodbye.

783
01:22:21,202 --> 01:22:22,294
Come visit me when you have time.

784
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:23,770
Yes, of course.

785
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:25,302
You all come.

786
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,370
Stone, scissors, paper.

787
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,845
Stone, scissors, paper.

788
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,080
You cheated. Get back.

789
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:37,041
Stone, scissors, paper.

790
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,779
Stone, scissors, paper.

791
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,820
Stone, scissors, paper.

792
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,925
Stone, scissors, paper.

793
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,220
Stone, scissors, paper.

794
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,290
Stone, scissors, paper.

795
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:41,671
Ranran.

796
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:45,081
What do you think about these earrings.

797
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:01,360
Let me get you a pair if you like them.

798
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,925
Bangkok, thunderstorm, 25 to 33 degrees.

799
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,798
San Francisco, sunny, 13 to 22 degrees.

800
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,146
London, overcast, 9 to 19 degrees.

801
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:02,852
Karachi, sunny, 27 to 35 degrees.

802
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:09,789
Moscow, showers, 4 to 16 degrees.

803
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,169
it's been two weeks since I returned to China

804
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:00,876
and I haven't visited Qu Ran

805
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:05,251
I was afraid that she's moved on

806
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:11,923
But somehow I felt I should go to
that show with Qu Ran

807
01:27:46,227 --> 01:27:48,627
Why am I coming to see this show?.

808
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:54,258
Why can't I cut myself offfrom this story?

809
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,804
Perhaps I've given up having expectations.

810
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:02,634
It's just that waiting has become my life.

811
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:29,694
Stop looking for it. It disappeared ages ago.

812
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:36,874
There's a stamp of Qu Ran's stamp on that book.
You must have thrown it out.

813
01:28:39,714 --> 01:28:41,375
The maid does the cleaning up.

814
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,380
I cannot remember everything.

815
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:48,945
You may forget other things,
but certainly not that book.

816
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:51,921
You took it out form my chest.

817
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:59,066
It's for you own good. Do you hate me for it?

818
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,668
How can I feel warmth?

819
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,495
All I wanted was to come back early
and take care of you...

820
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,002
To make you happy and healthy.

821
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:11,002
Why do I want to live long?

822
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,809
To look at my son stay single
for the rest ofhis life?

823
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,318
I heard Hou Jia came back.

824
01:29:26,661 --> 01:29:28,151
He's been gone six or seven years, rights?

825
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:31,887
Seven years.

826
01:29:33,601 --> 01:29:36,365
What're you two going to do?

827
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:41,368
That's ancient history.
Let's don't bring it up again.

828
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:45,572
Do you have any plans for yourself?.

829
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:55,378
Dad, sometimes I really want to get married.

830
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:03,463
But you know, these things...

831
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:11,702
I'll just stay with you and mom, make myselfthis
piece of junk useful.

832
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:21,744
I'm going to the hospital tomorrow for my report.

833
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,010
I'll go with you.

834
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:29,521
No, your mom can go with me.

835
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:51,567
I went back to the building
of my youth and childhood

836
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:53,312
Nothing has changed.

837
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,044
Qu Ran wasn't home.

838
01:30:57,218 --> 01:30:58,617
I only saw her mother and left my card.

839
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:01,451
He left a business card,
but I didn't have time for him.

840
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:38,180
Mom.

841
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,392
Ranran.

842
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:48,235
Your father's report came out.

843
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:51,694
It's not good.

844
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:16,194
It's my fault. I made him suffer.

845
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:27,368
Stop this nonsense.
Your father said he didn't want an operation.

846
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:41,714
My father's illness made me realize
how deeply I'd hurt him.

847
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:48,224
Hou Qia came to see me but
I didn't have any time for him

848
01:33:10,384 --> 01:33:11,510
Dad.

849
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:13,317
Oh.

850
01:33:14,055 --> 01:33:15,488
Time for your medicine.

851
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:33,599
Ranran.

852
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,612
Give Hou Jia a call.

853
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,614
He's always busy.

854
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,660
Just to get together, for old time's sake.

855
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:08,023
Hello.

856
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:14,906
This is Qu Zhiheng. My cancer's terminal,
and I don't know...

857
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:20,412
Ifl could still have the opportunity
to apologize to you in person.

858
01:35:23,684 --> 01:35:29,680
If possible, please have Hou Jia
come over to my house...

859
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:35,856
There's something that I'd like to say to him.

860
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:06,315
Do you still remember that day when
you confronted me in the courtyard?

861
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:16,201
I shouldn't have behaved like that,
I do apologize.

862
01:36:17,138 --> 01:36:22,599
It was so long ago.
Please don't make it difficult for yourself.

863
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:28,540
Hou Jia, I've done Ranran harm.

864
01:36:29,984 --> 01:36:32,179
My biggest sorrow...

865
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:36,251
Is to see my daughter...

866
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,493
Year after year,

867
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:42,319
Lose her youth...

868
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:47,626
Until she's turned into an old maid.

869
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:50,970
I, as her father...

870
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:55,071
Had ruined her chance for a happy life.

871
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,777
Uncle Qu.

872
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:05,111
If you could accept my apology...

873
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:11,351
I wish you and Ranran would get married.

874
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:20,991
This is a letter that I wrote to the organization.
It stated that...

875
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:25,769
Out of concern for the girl...

876
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:27,831
I had indeed told her that...

877
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:33,272
If she was forced into it,
then she was only the victim.

878
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:37,549
So I was responsible for your father's death.

879
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:42,851
If your mother finds it necessary...

880
01:37:43,724 --> 01:37:51,688
She can take this letter to the organization and
request them to re-open the file.

881
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:21,815
Why don't you invite Qu Ran
to visit your new home?

882
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:35,768
What's wrong with you? The phone's ringing.

883
01:40:17,211 --> 01:40:18,200
Qu Ran.

884
01:40:18,612 --> 01:40:19,601
It's me.

885
01:40:21,148 --> 01:40:22,445
How's your mom?

886
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:25,611
Is she okay?

887
01:40:27,621 --> 01:40:31,057
Give her my regards. You take care of yourself.

888
01:40:33,293 --> 01:40:35,887
Try to spend more time with her.

889
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:37,857
Yes.

890
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,263
There's something that
I've always wanted to ask you.

891
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,201
What is it? Please

892
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:47,173
All those years we were separated.

893
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:51,302
Now we can see each other again,
but we're not. Why?

894
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:57,208
My father has died;
and you know how much I'd hurt him

895
01:40:58,152 --> 01:40:59,414
But Qu Ran... he...

896
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:04,755
Hou Qia, we can never meet
the departed again, ever.

897
01:42:33,046 --> 01:42:35,207
I started living by myself.

898
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:38,477
I didn't see or call Qu Ran.

899
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:40,709
At that time I thought:

900
01:42:41,388 --> 01:42:45,654
Shakespeare's love story has brought us together
so many times before.

901
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,626
Now there's a new scenario,
can we still get together?

902
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:51,419
Somewhere, somehow....

903
01:42:51,965 --> 01:42:55,958
Will she and I brush past calmly?

904
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:06,475
Excuse me. Please wait.

905
01:43:08,582 --> 01:43:09,606
Right, that's it.

906
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:13,883
C'mon, don't lag behind.

907
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:23,685
It's pretty good.

908
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:34,501
You should also try it on when you time comes.

909
01:44:16,717 --> 01:44:17,706
What are you doing here?

910
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:18,809
Let me go say hello to a friend.

911
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:20,275
Qu Ran.

912
01:44:22,322 --> 01:44:23,311
You're...

913
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:26,354
It's my colleague.

914
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:28,216
Is it?

915
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:35,857
She wants to rent a wedding gown,
especially that one in the window.

916
01:44:42,175 --> 01:44:43,870
I thought...

917
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:50,842
She looks older than you.

918
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:55,116
It's her third marriage.

919
01:45:11,772 --> 01:45:17,233
Sir, buy a flower for the lady. Thank you.

920
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:20,246
Buy a flower please.

921
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:23,076
Happy Valentine.

922
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:28,644
Young people today celebrate Valentine,
I guess that's fashionable.

923
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:33,993
People are living better and
there're more festivities.

924
01:45:35,495 --> 01:45:36,621
Right.

925
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:39,399
We've been left behind.

926
01:45:41,401 --> 01:45:44,336
It's only lovers who are not married
that celebrate Valentine.

927
01:45:48,408 --> 01:45:50,239
In any case, for the occasion...

928
01:45:51,144 --> 01:45:52,702
I also brought you a small present.

929
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,441
What are you doing? Look at our age.

930
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:11,130
I've always worried that you'd give up.

931
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:14,667
All these years it's been torturing me.

932
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:20,631
Nothing will change ifwe don't talk about it...

933
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:26,436
Nothing will ever change if
we don't ever say a word about it.

934
01:46:33,286 --> 01:46:34,378
Qu Ran.

935
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:39,185
Let's get married.

936
01:46:41,194 --> 01:46:42,661
I want to make you happy.

937
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:57,577
To live with you in the same building...

938
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:01,845
That was once my happiness.

939
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:07,018
To live with you in the same city...

940
01:47:08,555 --> 01:47:10,147
That's also once my happiness.

941
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:21,590
To be alive with you at the same time
in this world...

942
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:24,363
That will be my happiness.

943
01:47:27,774 --> 01:47:29,264
Happiness...

944
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:34,506
Is a feeling from deep inside your heart.

945
01:48:22,929 --> 01:48:24,021
Hi, this way please

946
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:29,390
Stand over there a bit.

947
01:48:29,436 --> 01:48:30,801
Get close to each other.

948
01:48:33,507 --> 01:48:34,496
Right.

949
01:48:38,411 --> 01:48:39,400
Look this way.

950
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:41,845
We're doing the first set.

951
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:45,780
Don't move.

952
01:48:46,786 --> 01:48:48,117
Look this way.

953
01:48:52,592 --> 01:48:53,581
The bride...

954
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:54,718
The bride please smile.

955
01:49:01,601 --> 01:49:03,262
The bride please smiles again.

956
01:49:05,572 --> 01:49:06,869
Look this way.

957
01:49:09,042 --> 01:49:10,805
Ready...

958
01:49:11,912 --> 01:49:13,402
Ready...
