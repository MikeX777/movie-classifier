2
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,592
They
left their old world.

3
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,796
Left everything behind in
search for a land to call home.

4
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,635
But this land does
not belong to us.

5
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,839
We belong to the land.

6
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,745
They called us savages,

7
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,782
demonic creatures
who must be tamed.

8
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:54,821
They cut off our hair,
abolished our language,

9
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:58,758
stripped away our
faces, our oneness.

10
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:05,665
Kill the Indian, save
the man, they would say.

11
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:07,801
A new suit for every native

12
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,238
to be worn at all times,

13
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,175
even in death.

14
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,080
They captured a medicine man,

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,218
a powerful shaman
from the Hawea Tribe.

16
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,789
They chained him,
they tortured him,

17
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,726
they flayed his face.

18
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,165
With his last breath,

19
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:42,936
he placed a curse
on those chains.

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,238
A wicked curse.

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,975
A curse that spanned
through the ages.

22
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,845
A curse that sent
forth his spirit

23
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:57,284
to act in vengeance upon
those who held its chains.

24
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,085
I can't think
you enough, Billy.

25
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,319
Anything else?

26
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,921
Oh, that's off
limits over there.

27
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,157
That's for buyers.

28
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,225
It's just.

29
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,860
This is your stuff over here.

30
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,399
Thank you, Billy.

31
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,901
Have you talked to Moon?

32
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,104
I'm not there yet.

33
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,705
You've had plenty of time.

34
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,841
I have to be 100%.

35
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,879
You'll never be
100%, trust me.

36
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,052
Never stops ringing.

37
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,329
Steve.

38
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,197
Hey.

39
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,233
Yeah, it's a good one.

40
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,335
Its a nice piece, I know.

41
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,706
1939 Washman, I think.

42
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,275
Yeah.

43
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,346
You'll have to string
it up and find out.

44
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,981
I think she'll be good to go.

45
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,297
Okay, well, I guess let me
know when you want to come,

46
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,500
and I'll make sure it's all
out for you and ready to go.

47
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,967
You're welcome.

48
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,338
Hey, what's up?

49
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,972
It's River, I can't get
to the phone right now.

50
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,008
Just leave me a message.

51
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,959
I was gonna make something
that you really like

52
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,562
for dinner tonight.

53
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,165
Call me, please.

54
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,968
I need to talk to you.

55
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,007
Ow.

56
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:54,481
River?

57
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,286
River!

58
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,550
Work is a distraction

59
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:33,554
I need.

60
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:40,427
Work is a distraction I need.

61
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,344
Ow.

62
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,706
What is wrong with me?

63
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,143
Focus.

64
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,916
What are you doing?

65
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:23,850
I live here.

66
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,419
Not according to our records.

67
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,220
There was no mention of a sexy...

68
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,789
What, sexy what?

69
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,425
Listen, sister, you are
spreading God knows what

70
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,393
over a very sensitive
area right now.

71
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,795
And I would happily cuff
you and take you down...

72
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,263
Hey, you know, have
some respect, gentlemen.

73
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,398
She just lost her mother.

74
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,235
Hey, Moon.

75
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,507
Will you come with me please?

76
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,946
Hey, Bearman, remind me
again why you got suspended?

77
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,648
Was it when you broke
your suspect's collarbone,

78
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,316
or was it the two DUIs?

79
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,418
Or was it both?

80
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,386
It's not worth it.

81
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,521
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

82
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,363
Control yourself,
Officer Forman.

83
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:14,501
I'm sorry, sir, they
were just harassing her.

84
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,936
You must be Moon.

85
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,328
The way you found
the body was...

86
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,832
Everything about
this is very unusual.

87
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,303
There is nothing unusual
about finding a junky

88
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,471
face down, dead.

89
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,442
I'm done.

90
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,745
River, please.

91
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:01,848
I swear to God, if you touch
me again, it'll take everyone

92
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,918
in this room to keep
me from killing you.

93
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,688
Will you please just tell
them what they need to know?

94
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:10,824
It'll make things easier.

95
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:20,934
I really need you
to keep an eye on her.

96
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,469
Absolutely, sir.

97
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:25,372
Detective.

98
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,376
What is it?

99
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:33,480
It's probably nothing,
but there's something

100
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:37,384
that reminds me of a
case from 20 years ago.

101
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,022
Just keep an eye on her.

102
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,589
Make sure she doesn't
go into to the garage.

103
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,525
- Yes, sir.
- I gotta take this.

104
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,495
Forman, when I get a chance,

105
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,565
I'm gonna take a look at the
files from that old case.

106
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:52,699
Let me know if
you need anything.

107
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,434
I could look too.

108
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,602
Stay
on this for now.

109
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,404
Yes, sir.

110
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,508
I hope you still like
it with three sugars.

111
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,742
You don't have to do this.

112
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:06,546
Yeah, well, according
to Gutierrez, I do.

113
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,049
Thanks.

114
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,951
Everyone's
cleared out for now.

115
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:15,355
I'll let you know if
anyone's gonna come by later.

116
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:16,923
Should I call your house line?

117
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19,860
No, that line's disconnected.

118
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:20,727
Okay.

119
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,630
Well, seeing as how I
know you won't give me

120
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,632
your cell phone number,
here's what I'll do.

121
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,667
I'll drive up and down
with the sirens on,

122
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,704
and then I'll use the
horn and beep Morse code.

123
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,007
You know Morse code, right?

124
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,911
Hey, you know I still
have that ring that you...

125
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,412
646-555-0470.

126
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:41,848
What's that?

127
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:42,983
It's my cell.

128
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:44,651
That's only for emergencies.

129
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,057
That is all you.

130
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,728
Is there anything else I
can get you before I go?

131
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,097
Cleaning lady?

132
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,799
Yeah, I'll send mine over.

133
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:05,772
Hey, Moon.

134
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,510
It's good to see you.

135
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,731
Yo, what the...

136
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,101
Nice to meet you too.

137
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,668
You are unbelievable.

138
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:09,803
I'm just with my friends.

139
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,272
Have some respect for Mom.

140
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you have
no right talking about respect.

141
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,742
Okay, I'm not getting
high with my friends

142
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,111
and acting like
nothing happened.

143
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,279
I'm not high.

144
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:22,149
There is a law from like
1800-something that protects you

145
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,085
if you smoke weed
within like 24 hours

146
00:16:24,118 --> 00:16:26,686
of when somebody dies.

147
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,723
I need to talk to you.

148
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,757
I'm right here.

149
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,758
Alone.

150
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,127
My friends can hear
what you have to say.

151
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,729
Don't act tough around them.

152
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:36,896
I'm not acting.

153
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,565
- Maybe you should.
- Really?

154
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,666
- Yeah.
- How?

155
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:40,834
Like an adult.

156
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,770
She got you, man.

157
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,106
You're not gonna
take that, are you?

158
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,606
No, he's not.

159
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,642
I'm not wasting
my time with you.

160
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,112
Look, can you please just
come out in the hall with me?

161
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:52,779
Don't let her control you.

162
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,281
You listen, little girl.

163
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,749
You might be the flavor of
the week, but if you say

164
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,817
one more thing to me, I
will kick your teeth in.

165
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,820
Oh, damn, is that how
they do in New York?

166
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,689
I thought you told us she
was like a poet or something.

167
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,724
I don't know what she is.

168
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:05,658
Well, I'm gonna grab a drink.

169
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,726
Anybody want anything?

170
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,029
I'll go with you.

171
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:10,730
Yeah, man, me too.

172
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,800
All this family time is
making me kind of thirsty.

173
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,902
Are you coming?

174
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,105
Let's give 'em a minute.

175
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:23,743
These are your friends?

176
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,013
Oh, I don't know, maybe I
didn't have a role model around

177
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:26,946
to help me figure that one out.

178
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,680
Oh, this isn't about us.

179
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:28,915
Nothing is!

180
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:29,949
Come with me.

181
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,684
- Where?
- Out there.

182
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,821
You can't, that's
a crime scene, man.

183
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,124
No crime occurred there.

184
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:41,328
All death is a crime,
think about that.

185
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:42,196
So deep.

186
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,632
Come on, let's go see it.

187
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,300
No, why?

188
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:51,305
It just happened,
and we knew her.

189
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,307
And I wanna see, come on.

190
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,043
I'm okay here.

191
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:57,911
The two of you suck.

192
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:50,164
Your problem is you
think everything was bad

193
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,031
when you were still here.

194
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:52,699
It was Candyland!

195
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,837
Every day I came home
expecting to find her dead!

196
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,214
I'm sorry you had to find her.

197
00:19:07,248 --> 00:19:09,083
Who else would have?

198
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,920
Didn't you ever
think about that?

199
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:33,840
Look, all I'm asking is that
you help me clean the house

200
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,775
so that it can be
ready for the wake.

201
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,845
After that, I won't
expect anything else.

202
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,715
Everything's garbage,
just push it to the curb.

203
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:43,950
That's fine.

204
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,786
I still need you
to help me do it.

205
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,489
I've got driver's
ed, are you coming?

206
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,856
I'll drive.

207
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,325
Hector and Chrissie
need a ride too.

208
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,260
I'll drop them first.

209
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,264
Let's go.

210
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,003
River, please.

211
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,142
She's so lame.

212
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:10,944
Come on.

213
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,847
Come on, pick up the phone.

214
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,949
I figured you didn't eat.

215
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,120
No, I...

216
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:56,990
It's not much, it's
just rice and black beans.

217
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,093
My famous tortillas.

218
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:03,763
Okay, okay, okay, it's
just a little food.

219
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:11,238
People start crying
after they eat my beans.

220
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:13,173
Usually they're fightin'
for their lives,

221
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,042
sittin' on the toilet.

222
00:21:18,178 --> 00:21:20,347
It smells incredible.

223
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:23,050
That was your mom's favorite.

224
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,218
I can see why.

225
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,955
Thank you, I'll
make it up to you.

226
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,125
Your being here is enough.

227
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:34,961
Listen, she was clean.

228
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:39,099
I don't think so.

229
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,237
I mean, maybe she was trying,

230
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,073
but not the way they found her.

231
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,044
She was trying.

232
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:10,997
Done.

233
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,869
When's the wake?

234
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:17,970
Tomorrow.

235
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,174
I just want to get
it out of the way.

236
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:22,009
I figured so.

237
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,011
I can't make it.

238
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:26,013
I got some buyers in Amarillo,

239
00:22:26,046 --> 00:22:29,016
and I'll be gone for
about three days.

240
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,252
But when I come back,
you, and me, and River,

241
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:34,088
we're gonna go out.

242
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,325
It might just be me and you.

243
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:43,297
He hates you now, but
he'll do what I say.

244
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,667
At least he respects someone.

245
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,437
Respect, he just knows
I could kick his ass.

246
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:54,108
Don't worry about him,
he'll come around.

247
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:56,577
It's actually harder for him.

248
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,281
Thank you.

249
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:07,887
I love you, kid.

250
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:11,158
You call me if
anything comes up.

251
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:13,394
Everything's gonna be fine.

252
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,963
Now that you're here.

253
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,191
This is ridiculous.

254
00:24:55,462 --> 00:24:56,730
It's not you.

255
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:06,306
I don't get why she
thinks she can come home.

256
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:11,411
You're not the only
one whose mom just died.

257
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,247
How could you even...

258
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,715
I know she's a bitch,

259
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:18,318
but she's going through the
exact same thing you are.

260
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,186
But.

261
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,093
You got a class.

262
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:27,427
In five minutes.

263
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:42,209
Do me a favor?

264
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:42,843
What?

265
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,578
Hold my bag.

266
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:47,314
I've got something in there
I don't want anyone to see.

267
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:48,215
You included.

268
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:52,085
Thank you.

269
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,454
Try to learn something.

270
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:56,490
Yeah, right.

271
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:01,728
Come on, where are you?

272
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:29,656
Whatever.

273
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,319
Once I saw the
truck jackknife,

274
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:03,256
I realized I had two seconds
to decide what I was gonna do.

275
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,461
So I hit that black ice,
went into an insane 720 spin,

276
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:11,365
narrowly avoiding being
splattered by that truck.

277
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:14,301
But that truck driver
wasn't as fortunate.

278
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:18,305
He snapped his neck right
when he hit that divider.

279
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:20,440
Any questions?

280
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:28,515
Miss Wright, am I
interrupting your work?

281
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:31,184
No, I heard
everything you said.

282
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:32,653
And what was that?

283
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:36,556
That you were a stunt
driver or cab driver

284
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,525
or something like that.

285
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:40,827
You better clean
up your attitude,

286
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,496
or you will be
repeating this class.

287
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,765
And I am the only
one who teaches it.

288
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:46,233
You can't do that.

289
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,434
There's no test.

290
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:51,738
All we need are the hours,
and we don't sign in with you.

291
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:55,542
So tell me, how could
I possibly repeat this?

292
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,580
This is mine.

293
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:01,848
You can't take that.

294
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:03,250
My room, my rules.

295
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,286
And I say you can't
have this thing in here.

296
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:06,920
Douchebag.

297
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:09,489
Quiet!

298
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,493
What was that, Miss Wright?

299
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:51,765
River.

300
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,467
River, hey, wake up.

301
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:58,605
What'd you take?

302
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,682
- Huh?
- What'd you take?

303
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,686
Nothing.

304
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:17,257
You can be honest with me
about what drugs you're taking.

305
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:18,959
I didn't.

306
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:22,662
Then why were you
passed out on the floor?

307
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:34,407
I think it might've
been the paint fumes.

308
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:39,446
Is this yours?

309
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,414
Yeah.

310
00:29:42,415 --> 00:29:43,550
It sucks.

311
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:45,385
It just.

312
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:48,622
I don't know.

313
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:52,526
It just came to me.

314
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,061
It really sucks.

315
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,431
It's good.

316
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:02,069
I'll show you something good.

317
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:09,810
Hurry, come on.

318
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:13,847
Come on.

319
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,881
- Why?
- Shh.

320
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,534
Hey!

321
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:47,914
Hey, hey, I saw you two!

322
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:50,851
Stop right now or you'll
spend the rest of your day

323
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:53,653
on in-school
suspension tomorrow.

324
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,562
Come on, guys.

325
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:09,769
I know you went down here.

326
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,091
The building's about
to get locked up.

327
00:31:37,164 --> 00:31:38,999
I know you're in here.

328
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,973
Hello?

329
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:52,412
Hello, hello?

330
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:18,638
If you guys are in here,

331
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,766
give yourselves up now.

332
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,665
Come on.

333
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,551
Okay, open your eyes.

334
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:43,556
Great magic trick.

335
00:33:47,594 --> 00:33:49,763
After you, sir.

336
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:50,997
What
are we doing here?

337
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:52,133
Get inside.

338
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:55,069
Have a seat.

339
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:57,304
No, stupid, there.

340
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,078
So you're still not gonna
tell me why we're here?

341
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,645
Winning a bet.

342
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:09,783
Okay, that doesn't
tell me anything.

343
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,586
Put that on.

344
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:16,556
Here, really?

345
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:25,099
You're the boss.

346
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:33,740
I heard you two
come down here.

347
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:40,814
Look, if you come out
now, I won't report it.

348
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:43,917
You just gotta go home.

349
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,890
I heard you two laughing.

350
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:57,098
Look, I swear, if you two
jump out on me and give me

351
00:34:57,131 --> 00:35:01,235
a heart attack, I have no
choice but to kill you.

352
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:29,929
Cut it out, guys.

353
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:00,793
What the hell?

354
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:04,831
Look.

355
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,870
I don't know who you are, but
you shouldn't be down here.

356
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:16,210
And the building's about
to close, so you should...

357
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:19,913
Are you hurt?

358
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,783
Sweetie, it's all right.

359
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,022
Really, everything's
gonna be okay.

360
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,358
Just come with me.

361
00:36:31,392 --> 00:36:33,260
Please let me help you.

362
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:34,128
Oh God.

363
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:36,330
Oh God.

364
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:39,799
Oh God.

365
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:48,908
What was that?

366
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:50,910
The voices in your head.

367
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,248
Can we get out of here?

368
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:57,817
Sure, but first
that thing I gave you.

369
00:37:00,054 --> 00:37:01,921
I'm gonna need it back.

370
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:03,923
What thing?

371
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:12,032
You can't be serious.

372
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,003
It's all yours.

373
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,503
Where did I put it?

374
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:04,551
River?

375
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:13,926
River, are you?

376
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:23,936
God.

377
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,878
Ugh, what is that smell?

378
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:51,998
Weird.

379
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,046
Oh God.

380
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:07,541
Oh, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

381
00:40:15,382 --> 00:40:17,618
I will deal with you later.

382
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,500
Do you have a warrant?

383
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,068
Yeah, hold on.

384
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:41,041
Look, it's serious.

385
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:42,409
I tried calling.

386
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:48,148
I turned my phone
off, and then I lost it.

387
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:52,152
Oh, I'm so, so happy you
gave me your phone number.

388
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:57,024
Hey, I'm actually really
glad that you're here though.

389
00:40:57,057 --> 00:40:58,025
Really?

390
00:40:58,058 --> 00:41:01,328
Yeah, I need you to
help me clean a mouse

391
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:02,663
out of the workshop.

392
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:04,565
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

393
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:05,466
No, nope.

394
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:06,733
What do you mean no?

395
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:09,703
That's not in my
job description.

396
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:13,140
Pretty, pretty please.

397
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,208
I can't.

398
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:19,112
I have a mouse thing.

399
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:26,086
But you're paid
to carry a gun.

400
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:28,689
Yeah, that's unrelated.

401
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:30,257
Look, it's just a mouse.

402
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,425
It's already dead.

403
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:35,395
And it's going to remain
dead wherever you found it.

404
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,865
Well, I know who not to
call when I'm in danger.

405
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:40,534
You don't even keep
your phone on you anyway.

406
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,503
Look, I need to speak to River.

407
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:44,104
- Is everything okay?
- I'm sorry.

408
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:46,340
I need to speak to him.

409
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,709
He's in his room, come on.

410
00:41:58,285 --> 00:42:00,287
In his room, was it?

411
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:04,758
You two dating again?

412
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,761
Where the hell have you been?

413
00:42:07,794 --> 00:42:10,264
I was robbing a jewelry store.

414
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:11,498
- River.
- Moon.

415
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:12,766
River, it's...

416
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,269
Do you love the
sound of my name?

417
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,440
You're just like Mom,
always saying my name.

418
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,709
Why weren't you here?

419
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:24,611
I could ask you
the same thing.

420
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:26,580
I'm talking about right now.

421
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,215
It's, what time is it?

422
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:29,149
It's 1:15.

423
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:31,752
That's way too late to be out.

424
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:35,289
I have no curfew.

425
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:36,623
Had no curfew.

426
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:37,791
What, you're staying?

427
00:42:37,824 --> 00:42:38,992
If that's what it takes.

428
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:40,694
If that's what it takes
for what, me having a curfew?

429
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,596
Hey, I hate to interrupt
this family reunion,

430
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:44,431
but I really need to ask
him about his whereabouts

431
00:42:44,464 --> 00:42:46,199
earlier tonight.

432
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:47,701
Ask away.

433
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:48,535
Have a seat.

434
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,170
I'm good here.

435
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:51,371
Have a seat.

436
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,781
Have a seat.

437
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:11,792
Where were you
at 6:45 tonight?

438
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:12,659
School.

439
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,329
Specifically.

440
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,131
The locker room.

441
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:19,299
More specifically.

442
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,434
What's going on?

443
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:21,735
Moon, please.

444
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:29,276
You know, there's
cameras in the hallway,

445
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:31,578
so I suggest you don't lie.

446
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:37,217
I was in the
boys' locker room.

447
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,620
Look, it was stupid,
but whatever.

448
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,755
I didn't do anything.

449
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:44,691
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Hamilton?

450
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:45,659
I didn't.

451
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:49,296
No?

452
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:50,731
No, not really.

453
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:54,635
I heard him because he
was chasing after us,

454
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:56,570
but he didn't catch us.

455
00:43:56,603 --> 00:43:57,838
He...

456
00:43:57,871 --> 00:44:00,941
He almost caught us in
the boys' locker room,

457
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,709
but he didn't.

458
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:05,445
So I guess I technically
saw him about five minutes

459
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,280
after he dismissed driver's ed.

460
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,516
What were you doing in
the boys' locker room?

461
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:11,652
Changing into my gym uniform.

462
00:44:11,685 --> 00:44:12,753
Answer him.

463
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:18,759
I was having sex
with my girlfriend

464
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:21,328
in the gym teacher's office.

465
00:44:21,361 --> 00:44:25,198
If you need proof
that I was there,

466
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:27,267
check the file cabinet
next to the door.

467
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,870
Top drawer, behind the folders.

468
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:32,739
It was a stupid bet Bethany
made with some girl.

469
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:33,974
What'd you leave there?

470
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:37,878
Something that would
prove I was there.

471
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:41,248
I don't know if you can test
semen for time of ejaculation,

472
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:44,484
but I'd say it was
around seven or so.

473
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,953
What'd you do afterwards?

474
00:44:46,987 --> 00:44:48,689
Went to Hector's house.

475
00:44:48,722 --> 00:44:50,390
Hector Solanos.

476
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:53,427
No, immediately after
you left the locker room.

477
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,595
You checked the cameras.

478
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:59,232
Look, officer, my little offense
of mine may be punishable

479
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:01,368
within the warped
context of school,

480
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:03,937
but I don't think you
need to involve yourself.

481
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,273
Mr. Hamilton was found dead
in the girls' locker room

482
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:09,443
around 7:30 tonight,
face down in the shower,

483
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:11,445
similar to how your
mother was found.

484
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:13,580
You think I killed him?

485
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,452
I hope it's just
a coincidence.

486
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:19,386
I didn't kill anybody.

487
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:20,487
I have to ask these questions.

488
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,322
I have no reason
to kill anybody.

489
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:23,757
Something is going on.

490
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,960
Feels that way,
but I'm not so sure.

491
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,799
I need you to just lay low
for the next couple of days.

492
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,901
Does this mean
I can cut school?

493
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:38,039
Yeah, but you didn't
hear that from me.

494
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:40,807
We have the wake
here tomorrow.

495
00:45:43,343 --> 00:45:44,845
I know, I'm gonna clean.

496
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:47,447
You should help her.

497
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:49,282
It's not my mess.

498
00:45:50,517 --> 00:45:51,618
Hey, River.

499
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:57,324
Look, you gotta watch out.

500
00:45:57,357 --> 00:46:01,461
You don't want people to get
the wrong impression about you.

501
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:31,558
This?

502
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:32,993
All this for that organic
food project for health class.

503
00:46:34,594 --> 00:46:35,796
She did not believe you.

504
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:37,531
I swear to God she did, man.

505
00:46:37,564 --> 00:46:39,866
Oh my God, I wish my
mom was that stupid.

506
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,501
Yeah.

507
00:46:41,535 --> 00:46:42,636
There were like Doritos
all over the place.

508
00:46:48,042 --> 00:46:51,745
Isn't it crazy how there's like
a funeral going on outside?

509
00:46:51,778 --> 00:46:53,613
It's a wake.

510
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:55,582
Yeah, man, same difference.

511
00:46:55,615 --> 00:46:57,784
You mom was a special soul, man.

512
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,853
Like an angel without wings.

513
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:01,588
That was beautiful.

514
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,991
I have something for us.

515
00:47:05,026 --> 00:47:07,427
Okay, close your eyes.

516
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,495
Everybody.

517
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:40,894
Okay, open your eyes.

518
00:47:42,629 --> 00:47:43,597
What do you think?

519
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,564
Cool, man.

520
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:45,665
What is it?

521
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:50,871
Wow, you made this?

522
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:54,407
We needed something that

523
00:47:56,509 --> 00:47:57,911
bonded us together.

524
00:47:57,944 --> 00:47:59,479
For sure, man.

525
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,649
I'm never taking mine off ever.

526
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:06,586
Even if I take it off,
it's gonna be on, you know?

527
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,654
Here, will you
help me with mine?

528
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:09,656
The clasp is kinda tricky.

529
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:17,664
Thanks, Beth.

530
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,603
What do you think?

531
00:48:23,637 --> 00:48:24,638
It's nice.

532
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:26,706
Just nice?

533
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:30,144
Really nice.

534
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:31,678
What's wrong?

535
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:32,646
I don't know.

536
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:36,117
Maybe I'm just thinking
about my dead mother.

537
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:48,362
Thanks.

538
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:52,565
Can you arrest all these people?

539
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,733
That bad, huh?

540
00:48:55,535 --> 00:48:59,206
I don't know any of these
people, but I hate all of them.

541
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:02,176
Technically, it'll be
over in about an hour.

542
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,744
Yeah, they're not leaving.

543
00:49:09,183 --> 00:49:10,750
Sorry, everyone.

544
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:14,654
I never figured out the
whole walking thing.

545
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:16,957
Where is the casket?

546
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,692
Come on, Hector.

547
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:25,899
Hey, you can't go.

548
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:27,268
I can't be here.

549
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:29,669
I can't let you leave,
not in this condition.

550
00:49:29,703 --> 00:49:31,604
I haven't had anything.

551
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,819
What time is it?

552
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,660
A few minutes past four.

553
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:29,796
I was out the whole time?

554
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:31,698
Yeah, pretty much.

555
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,633
Well, you screamed,
you flew backwards,

556
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:36,070
and then you passed out.

557
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:37,271
- Great.
- Yeah.

558
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:38,738
Worked out perfectly.

559
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:41,108
Everyone left once
you passed out.

560
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,012
Except you.

561
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:52,119
You know, I was just
thinking maybe we could

562
00:50:52,153 --> 00:50:54,155
go get some dinner somewhere.

563
00:50:54,188 --> 00:50:55,655
It doesn't have to
be anything formal.

564
00:50:55,688 --> 00:50:57,358
It's just a meal
between two old friends

565
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,693
who haven't seen each
other in seven years

566
00:51:00,727 --> 00:51:04,331
and are still officially
boyfriend-girlfriend.

567
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:09,136
I'm breaking up with you.

568
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:18,678
That's good, that's good.

569
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:20,680
So what time am I picking
you up for dinner?

570
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:21,981
You're a stalker.

571
00:51:22,016 --> 00:51:25,952
As far as the law's
concerned, I'm not.

572
00:51:25,985 --> 00:51:28,089
How about nine?

573
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:31,758
Gotta make sure it's
okay with my wife.

574
00:51:37,231 --> 00:51:38,065
Hey.

575
00:51:41,001 --> 00:51:43,736
Can I tell you something
and have you not think

576
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,637
that I'm crazy?

577
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:46,207
Well, I already
think you're crazy,

578
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,809
but I won't think
you're any crazier.

579
00:51:49,843 --> 00:51:51,711
Something really
strange has happened twice

580
00:51:51,744 --> 00:51:52,979
since I've been back.

581
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:54,681
Strange.

582
00:51:54,714 --> 00:51:58,152
Strange like your living
room being turned into

583
00:51:58,185 --> 00:51:59,086
a rehab clinic.

584
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,820
That kind of strange.

585
00:52:02,223 --> 00:52:06,093
Those aren't even the
worst of her friends either.

586
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:08,895
No.

587
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,736
I've been having visions.

588
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:19,206
Like what?

589
00:52:22,076 --> 00:52:23,344
I don't know.

590
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:30,251
It happens so fast, and
it's not very clear.

591
00:52:33,187 --> 00:52:36,956
But I saw someone being
dragged and tortured,

592
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:44,265
or at least it seems that way.

593
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:52,439
Well, it may just be a
combination of jet lag and stress.

594
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:56,809
I've been hearing noises too.

595
00:52:56,843 --> 00:53:00,014
Well, you probably
shouldn't stay here.

596
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:06,920
Do you think that my mom's
death and that teacher's death

597
00:53:08,322 --> 00:53:11,392
were too similar to
be a coincidence?

598
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:19,366
Well, if they're
not a coincidence,

599
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,868
unfortunately your
brother's the prime suspect.

600
00:53:21,901 --> 00:53:23,204
He didn't do it.

601
00:53:24,405 --> 00:53:27,840
Well, then they're
just a coincidence.

602
00:53:29,043 --> 00:53:32,213
Look, I think the best thing
for you is just to relax

603
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:33,414
for the next few hours.

604
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:35,349
We'll go, we'll
get some good food,

605
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,816
take your mind off things,

606
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:40,154
and then we'll figure
it all out tomorrow.

607
00:53:41,854 --> 00:53:45,392
Have there been any
other deaths like that?

608
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,863
I don't know, but I
could look into it for you.

609
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:54,468
Thank you.

610
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:05,012
Is there anything else I
can do for you before I go?

611
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:06,946
No, I'm fine, thanks.

612
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:13,987
Well, give me a call
if you need anything.

613
00:54:16,023 --> 00:54:18,259
I will pick you up at nine.

614
00:54:19,393 --> 00:54:22,296
Wait, Tyler,
sorry about earlier.

615
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,331
No, it's totally cool.

616
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:28,068
I'm happy it's officially over.

617
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:31,205
Now I can finally
start dating again.

618
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:27,448
Do I like this color?

619
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:09,623
So you're
talking to me from now on?

620
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,360
I gotta go.

621
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,735
Hello, can I help you?

622
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:28,041
The wake was a couple hours ago.

623
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:30,711
You speak English?

624
00:58:35,282 --> 00:58:36,350
Hello, hello?

625
00:58:38,452 --> 00:58:40,521
This is private property.

626
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:08,148
This isn't funny,
whatever you're doing.

627
00:59:51,692 --> 00:59:54,361
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

628
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:57,564
Come on, come on,
come on, don't die!

629
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:58,398
Oh yes.

630
00:59:58,432 --> 00:59:59,299
Oh yes, yes, yes.

631
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:01,201
Yes, come on, come on.

632
01:00:01,234 --> 01:00:02,235
Do you need anything?

633
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,737
Water, coffee, milk, juice?

634
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,605
Shh.

635
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,508
Oh, I got it, I got it.

636
01:00:16,216 --> 01:00:17,517
It's not that bad.

637
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:20,320
You sure you want
a Band-Aid up here?

638
01:00:20,354 --> 01:00:21,855
No, I guess not.

639
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,326
You're pretty good at this.

640
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,195
I had to learn.

641
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:30,464
Mom was always hurting herself.

642
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:34,668
I'm good with any cuts,
sprains, burns, or bruises.

643
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:37,604
Thanks.

644
01:00:40,507 --> 01:00:41,842
What happened?

645
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:44,911
I don't know.

646
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:48,448
I think I saw something
that wasn't there.

647
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:54,755
It's all foggy.

648
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:57,290
It's gonna be for a while.

649
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:58,859
You hit your head pretty hard.

650
01:00:58,892 --> 01:01:00,293
Yeah, I know.

651
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,432
Have you seen anything?

652
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:08,669
No.

653
01:01:09,936 --> 01:01:11,438
I'm going crazy.

654
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:14,307
You're not.

655
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:20,580
I thought you were dead.

656
01:01:20,614 --> 01:01:22,683
Wishful thinking?

657
01:01:22,716 --> 01:01:23,550
No.

658
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:30,257
I mean, I still hate you and
I will never forgive you,

659
01:01:31,692 --> 01:01:33,927
but I didn't want you dead.

660
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,231
I'm sorry.

661
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,604
I was a terrible sister.

662
01:01:44,638 --> 01:01:47,374
You had to almost
die to realize that?

663
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:50,477
- I just...
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

664
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:52,679
I get it.

665
01:01:53,914 --> 01:01:57,350
Honestly, I would've
done the same thing.

666
01:01:58,618 --> 01:02:01,354
In about a year, I would've
shown up at your apartment

667
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:03,557
and squatted on your
couch for about 10 years.

668
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,825
Really?

669
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:06,359
Maybe.

670
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:07,594
10 years?

671
01:02:07,627 --> 01:02:10,397
Undergrad and medical school.

672
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:13,934
Your grades are
good enough for that?

673
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:16,737
My friends are
stupid, I'm not.

674
01:02:19,606 --> 01:02:22,909
Speaking of which, I
gotta meet them soon.

675
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:24,045
We have a project in US history,

676
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:26,813
and if it is a second late
we drop two letter grades.

677
01:02:26,847 --> 01:02:28,515
But I don't want you to go.

678
01:02:28,548 --> 01:02:31,384
I don't want them coming here.

679
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:32,953
You'll be okay?

680
01:02:32,986 --> 01:02:35,422
I'm going out with Tyler.

681
01:02:36,556 --> 01:02:37,891
What?

682
01:02:37,924 --> 01:02:39,659
I didn't say a word.

683
01:02:39,693 --> 01:02:41,561
Just be careful.

684
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:43,730
I don't have to
worry with him.

685
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:47,834
Never trust a guy who
always carries handcuffs.

686
01:02:50,037 --> 01:02:53,340
Hey, just 'cause we talked
doesn't mean we're friends.

687
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:54,008
I know.

688
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:58,445
Hey, keep your phone on.

689
01:02:59,546 --> 01:03:00,580
I don't even have your number.

690
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:01,815
Yes, you do.

691
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:04,818
Your code wasn't that
hard to figure out.

692
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:08,922
Don't worry, I didn't
look at anything else.

693
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:10,490
See you later.

694
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:13,527
Keep it on.

695
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,629
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

696
01:03:33,747 --> 01:03:34,581
Hey.

697
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:38,518
I called a lot.

698
01:03:42,023 --> 01:03:43,257
And I'm early.

699
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:47,561
No, I'm sorry, my phone was
on vibrate and I was out cold.

700
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:48,428
Oh.

701
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:52,866
It's meaningless.

702
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:56,003
Thank you.

703
01:03:56,037 --> 01:03:58,405
And we're not
going anywhere fancy,

704
01:03:58,438 --> 01:04:00,507
so you don't have to
get too dressed up.

705
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,476
Okay, just give
me one minute, okay?

706
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:11,651
And I mean it, the
flower means nothing.

707
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:15,589
I know, I already
flushed it down the toilet.

708
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:16,623
Excellent.

709
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:38,478
So how's it goin'?

710
01:04:38,511 --> 01:04:40,081
- Almost done.
- Good.

711
01:04:41,615 --> 01:04:44,118
'Cause I need you for something.

712
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:46,686
Give me a couple minutes.

713
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,588
That thing man.

714
01:04:48,622 --> 01:04:50,590
I've got that thing.

715
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:53,994
This is like some other
world right here, man.

716
01:04:54,028 --> 01:04:57,731
Something beyond everything
that you can't get in stores.

717
01:04:57,764 --> 01:05:00,567
And how'd you get it?

718
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,402
Divine intervention.

719
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:06,673
You'll know what I mean
when you have a taste.

720
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:09,676
This stuff takes you
to the next dimension.

721
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:11,645
What is it?

722
01:05:11,678 --> 01:05:12,712
I don't know.

723
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:19,486
It's got a couple
different names.

724
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:20,820
Well, can you
tell us one of them?

725
01:05:22,622 --> 01:05:25,592
Like tequila but
more, so more, man.

726
01:05:27,627 --> 01:05:30,164
Look, even the worm
can't handle this.

727
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:32,732
This needs something deadly.

728
01:05:41,641 --> 01:05:44,945
Just like the first
time every time.

729
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:46,713
It will JFK you.

730
01:05:46,746 --> 01:05:50,483
I don't think I wanna ask
what that's supposed to mean.

731
01:05:50,517 --> 01:05:52,986
It will blow your mind.

732
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,155
Tasteful.

733
01:05:54,188 --> 01:05:55,722
It is.

734
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:56,690
Who's next?

735
01:05:58,192 --> 01:05:59,026
Done.

736
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:01,561
I need to type this up,
can I use your computer?

737
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:02,696
Yeah, man.

738
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:06,267
Just put the right password in.

739
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,101
420God.

740
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:09,136
Live that motto, man.

741
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:10,570
Live that motto.

742
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:11,938
I'll help you.

743
01:06:16,776 --> 01:06:20,181
Oh, I'm gonna
make some brownies.

744
01:06:20,214 --> 01:06:23,284
Oh, they're gonna be so good.

745
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:24,218
Hey, man.

746
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,689
So everything on
the menu's good,

747
01:06:29,723 --> 01:06:31,992
except for the apps and entrees.

748
01:06:32,026 --> 01:06:35,196
But if you're in the mood
for liquor and dessert,

749
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:36,730
this is the place.

750
01:06:58,651 --> 01:07:00,820
I got three semesters,
but I don't know.

751
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:02,856
I wasted everything
while I was there.

752
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:04,025
You going back?

753
01:07:04,058 --> 01:07:06,260
You know, I can
finish school anywhere.

754
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:09,729
I might stay and let
River finish here.

755
01:07:09,763 --> 01:07:10,697
I mean, he could go with me,

756
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:12,899
but I just don't think
it'd be fair to him.

757
01:07:12,932 --> 01:07:16,836
Yeah, well, if you do,
maybe we could eat again

758
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:19,206
once in another seven years.

759
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:22,009
Don't push your luck.

760
01:07:22,043 --> 01:07:24,844
Yeah, wouldn't
even think of it.

761
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:30,151
So I did some snooping
around for you.

762
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:31,918
Yeah?

763
01:07:44,697 --> 01:07:45,865
Oh, come on.

764
01:07:56,177 --> 01:07:57,011
What?

765
01:07:57,977 --> 01:07:58,812
No way.

766
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:15,762
You almost done?

767
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:17,597
20 minutes, tops.

768
01:08:19,732 --> 01:08:21,701
That's a really long time.

769
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:25,738
It'll take longer if
you keep interrupting me.

770
01:08:51,831 --> 01:08:52,699
Don't you want a break?

771
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:56,003
Don't you
want a good grade?

772
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:13,853
I mean, you've been working
so hard, you deserve a break.

773
01:09:14,787 --> 01:09:17,057
I just wanna get this done.

774
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:21,262
There's other things
that need to get done too.

775
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:26,866
I should probably...

776
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,835
Take a break, I know.

777
01:09:41,315 --> 01:09:42,249
So there have
been some instances?

778
01:09:42,283 --> 01:09:43,450
Right, right, right.

779
01:09:43,484 --> 01:09:44,884
Okay, a few pockets
of these deaths.

780
01:09:44,918 --> 01:09:47,488
It goes all the way
back to the 1930s.

781
01:09:47,521 --> 01:09:49,989
Now, like I said, I can't
say that any of these deaths

782
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:54,061
are related in any way,
but there was a small burst

783
01:09:54,094 --> 01:09:57,431
of explainable sudden
deaths, usually with people

784
01:09:57,464 --> 01:09:59,999
that either knew each other
or were affiliated somehow.

785
01:10:00,034 --> 01:10:01,468
Well, okay.

786
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:04,438
Okay, but the only problem
is they weren't crimes.

787
01:10:04,471 --> 01:10:06,340
But they could've been.

788
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,875
Well, we can only
go off what we know,

789
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:11,412
and none of 'em
point to someone.

790
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:14,914
If the first reported
cases of these deaths

791
01:10:14,948 --> 01:10:18,918
were over 80 years ago, then
it can't be the same person.

792
01:10:20,054 --> 01:10:22,389
It's probably just
a coincidence.

793
01:10:22,423 --> 01:10:24,857
I mean, there's just
strange things that happen

794
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:26,826
that you just can't explain.

795
01:10:26,859 --> 01:10:29,963
But what if it's not a person?

796
01:10:29,996 --> 01:10:31,998
What would it be then?

797
01:10:34,134 --> 01:10:34,767
A ghost.

798
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,938
Moon, I'm trying to help you,

799
01:10:38,972 --> 01:10:41,774
but we gotta go off
facts and reality.

800
01:10:41,808 --> 01:10:45,212
I think someone tried
to kill me tonight.

801
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:51,951
Hey, little scorpion.

802
01:10:54,521 --> 01:10:56,056
That's not good.

803
01:11:02,062 --> 01:11:03,830
Wish I had a straw.

804
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:08,202
What about you, man?

805
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:12,106
What the?

806
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:32,326
I'm not saying I
don't believe you,

807
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:36,130
but you got to admit this
is pretty far out there.

808
01:11:36,163 --> 01:11:37,930
Did River see anything?

809
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:41,934
I don't know, but that
doesn't mean it didn't happen.

810
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:45,205
Why don't you tell
me about the first time

811
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:48,108
you started believing in ghosts?

812
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:49,976
This isn't funny.

813
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,278
Okay, I'm sorry.

814
01:11:51,312 --> 01:11:53,180
I'm just trying to make
you feel less stressed.

815
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:55,049
By making fun of me.

816
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:40,394
It's just spilled milk.

817
01:13:14,194 --> 01:13:15,229
I get so crazy.

818
01:13:27,474 --> 01:13:30,043
I have to go pee.

819
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:31,645
Stay.

820
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:33,213
And pee in bed?

821
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:34,947
It's not my bed.

822
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:36,283
That's so gross.

823
01:13:37,718 --> 01:13:40,920
What if I'm into
that kinda stuff?

824
01:13:43,123 --> 01:13:44,658
Pass me your shirt.

825
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,131
Don't you have work to do?

826
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:53,500
Just gonna let
Hector finish it later.

827
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:55,436
I'll sign up
for summer school now.

828
01:14:54,127 --> 01:14:57,464
Hey, I said you're
taking a long time.

829
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,603
It's okay if you're pooping.

830
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:05,205
I know girls do that stuff too.

831
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:09,243
Fine, don't talk to me.

832
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:13,347
I'm getting a snack.

833
01:15:19,086 --> 01:15:19,720
Oh my God.

834
01:15:25,092 --> 01:15:25,726
No!

835
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:31,098
Bethany.

836
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:52,753
No, no, no.

837
01:15:52,786 --> 01:15:55,322
Everyone's gotta go
through it, especially me.

838
01:15:55,355 --> 01:15:57,624
They think my dad pulled
strings, which he doesn't.

839
01:15:59,293 --> 01:16:01,194
Hold on, excuse me.

840
01:16:03,363 --> 01:16:04,331
What's up?

841
01:16:04,364 --> 01:16:05,766
They're dead!

842
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:08,535
Hector, Chrissie, Bethany,
they're dead, Moon.

843
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:10,203
I don't know how it happened!

844
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:11,872
I don't know!

845
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,840
Wait, hello?

846
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:15,108
Hello?

847
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:16,176
- No!
- What's going on?

848
01:16:16,209 --> 01:16:17,444
River?

849
01:16:17,477 --> 01:16:18,712
What's wrong?

850
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,382
River.

851
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:29,323
This should cover it.

852
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:31,358
- Sorry.
- Okay, good luck.

853
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:43,837
Moon, Moon, let
me handle this.

854
01:16:52,379 --> 01:16:53,747
It's locked.

855
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:56,717
I'm going around the back.

856
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,585
Just like old times.

857
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,125
River?

858
01:17:16,803 --> 01:17:17,738
She's dead.

859
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:21,375
I told you something
was happening.

860
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:23,243
I'm gonna call this in.

861
01:17:23,276 --> 01:17:25,412
Let's find River first.

862
01:17:25,445 --> 01:17:28,915
And do me a favor, stay
behind me this time.

863
01:17:54,374 --> 01:17:55,375
Is it him?

864
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:57,644
No.

865
01:17:57,678 --> 01:18:00,347
You don't wanna look in there.

866
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:12,559
Oh no, this
can't be happening.

867
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:39,453
The chain.

868
01:18:44,624 --> 01:18:45,792
Get the chain.

869
01:18:48,428 --> 01:18:49,830
You okay?

870
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:51,631
Are you okay?

871
01:18:51,665 --> 01:18:53,300
Just check him.

872
01:18:58,638 --> 01:18:59,873
He's alive.

873
01:18:59,906 --> 01:19:01,341
He's trapped.

874
01:19:01,374 --> 01:19:02,409
What?

875
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,312
I have to get him out.

876
01:19:05,345 --> 01:19:06,047
What are you saying?

877
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:06,847
Look, I'm gonna call this in.

878
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,049
We'll wait for the...

879
01:19:08,082 --> 01:19:10,283
No, I'm the only
one that can save him.

880
01:19:10,317 --> 01:19:11,384
He's stable.

881
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:14,821
He's stable, but
he needs an EMT.

882
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:15,789
You don't understand.

883
01:19:15,822 --> 01:19:16,990
He's not here.

884
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:20,527
Please just help me carry him.

885
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,628
Okay, Moon, you
don't understand.

886
01:19:21,661 --> 01:19:23,830
This is a police matter.

887
01:19:23,864 --> 01:19:26,533
I'm gonna call this in, but if
I leave the scene of a crime,

888
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:28,035
I could lose my job.

889
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:29,770
Please.

890
01:19:31,872 --> 01:19:32,706
Please.

891
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:51,491
This is Forman, badge 1740.

892
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:53,627
I'm in pursuit of a
suspect on Hartford Street.

893
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:57,430
There are two, possibly three,
DOAs at 2455 Hartford Street.

894
01:19:57,464 --> 01:20:00,567
Send backup patrol
and EMT, 10-18.

895
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,471
Come on, we gotta get
him to the workshop.

896
01:20:05,772 --> 01:20:07,440
What are we doing?

897
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,392
I mean, is he...

898
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:26,726
He's fine there.

899
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:32,399
Okay, this is where
I saw it, right here.

900
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:33,600
Okay, what are
you talking about?

901
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:34,935
The thing that's
been killing everybody.

902
01:20:34,968 --> 01:20:36,037
It's because of this.

903
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,470
How do you know that?

904
01:20:37,504 --> 01:20:39,439
Because I've seen it.

905
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:47,048
Look, can we just
please stop, okay?

906
01:20:47,081 --> 01:20:49,916
Look, we have to get
help for River right now.

907
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,152
Come and get me.

908
01:20:51,185 --> 01:20:53,587
Okay, just stop,
just stop, just stop.

909
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:54,688
Just sit and stop.

910
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:56,423
Stop for a second.

911
01:20:57,791 --> 01:21:01,028
Look, you need to be
here with River, okay?

912
01:21:01,062 --> 01:21:02,462
I'll take care of it.

913
01:21:02,495 --> 01:21:03,797
No, you can't.

914
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:05,999
My God, how do you
know that for sure?

915
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:06,833
You can't.

916
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:08,169
Please just trust me.

917
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:11,005
I'm not gonna let
you kill yourself.

918
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,539
You're all he has.

919
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:15,709
It has to be me.

920
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:24,784
I don't want you to go again.

921
01:21:24,818 --> 01:21:25,652
I won't.

922
01:21:28,022 --> 01:21:31,558
I'll take care of
everything, I promise.

923
01:21:32,592 --> 01:21:33,426
I promise.

924
01:21:38,598 --> 01:21:41,768
Why won't you just let
me take care of this?

925
01:21:41,801 --> 01:21:43,603
It has to be me.

926
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:37,244
Mom?

927
01:24:44,385 --> 01:24:45,219
Mom?

928
01:24:51,724 --> 01:24:52,725
I'm sorry.

929
01:24:54,727 --> 01:24:55,362
I tried.

930
01:24:56,863 --> 01:24:57,697
What?

931
01:24:58,798 --> 01:24:59,833
To stop.

932
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,305
I know.

933
01:25:05,239 --> 01:25:06,606
Where's River?

934
01:25:07,807 --> 01:25:11,312
I just wanted
us to be us again.

935
01:25:11,345 --> 01:25:13,114
Mom, where's River?

936
01:25:14,881 --> 01:25:16,749
It's all I wanted.

937
01:25:18,219 --> 01:25:21,322
We can't be together
without River.

938
01:25:23,324 --> 01:25:24,158
I tried,

939
01:25:27,328 --> 01:25:29,230
but nobody believed me.

940
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:32,932
You tried to what?

941
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:36,836
To warn you.

942
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:40,341
To warn you.

943
01:25:44,044 --> 01:25:44,878
No, Mom!

944
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,914
Mom!

945
01:27:05,925 --> 01:27:06,759
Mom!

946
01:27:10,264 --> 01:27:11,098
Mom!

947
01:28:02,316 --> 01:28:03,417
Moon, Moon!

948
01:28:40,953 --> 01:28:41,988
Bethany?

949
01:28:44,224 --> 01:28:45,559
Oh God, Bethany.

950
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:21,295
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

951
01:29:21,328 --> 01:29:23,597
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

952
01:29:24,997 --> 01:29:26,567
Oh, Moon, come on.

953
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,002
Come on, come on.

954
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:29,936
He didn't get you.

955
01:29:29,969 --> 01:29:31,938
You can snap out of this.

956
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:34,241
He didn't get you.

957
01:30:20,254 --> 01:30:22,022
There's something that
reminds me of a case

958
01:30:22,055 --> 01:30:23,357
from 20 years ago.

959
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:39,006
My God.

960
01:30:56,557 --> 01:30:58,759
Doesn't make any sense.

961
01:31:06,767 --> 01:31:07,967
Hello?

962
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:11,538
No, I don't think I'm gonna
be able to get to it tonight.

963
01:33:05,385 --> 01:33:06,219
Nah.

964
01:33:10,679 --> 01:33:13,476
