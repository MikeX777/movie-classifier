1
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,297
<i>GERMANY</i>

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:10,272
<i>Let others speak of their disgrace</i>,
<i>I am speaking of my own.</i>

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,809
<i>O Germany, pale mother!</i>

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,614
<i>How you sit defiled</i>
<i>among the peoples.</i>

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,716
<i>Among the besmirched</i>
<i>you stand out.</i>

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,361
<i>Of your sons the poorest</i>
<i>lies struck down.</i>

7
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,126
<i>When his hunger was great</i>,

8
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,598
<i>your other sons raised</i>
<i>their hands against him.</i>

9
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,393
<i>This is now notorious.</i>

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,532
<i>With their hands thus raised</i>,
<i>raised against their brother</i>,

11
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:46,635
<i>they stride around insolent before</i>
<i>you and laugh in your face.</i>

12
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,780
<i>This is known.</i>

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,280
<i>In your house</i>
<i>lies are loudly bawled.</i>

14
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,220
<i>But truth must keep silent</i>,
<i>is that so?</i>

15
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:01,457
<i>Why do the oppressors</i>
<i>on every side praise you...</i>

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,029
<i>but the oppressed indict you?</i>

17
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,825
<i>The exploited point</i>
<i>their fingers at you</i>,

18
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:13,736
<i>but the exploiters laud the system</i>
<i>devised in your house.</i>

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,867
<i>And at the same time all see you</i>
<i>hiding the hem of your skirt...</i>

20
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:22,175
<i>which is bloody with the blood</i>
<i>of your best son.</i>

21
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:27,276
<i>When they hear the speeches issuing</i>
<i>from your house, people laugh.</i>

22
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:33,448
<i>But whoever sees you grips his knife</i>
<i>as one seeing a murderess.</i>

23
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,994
<i>O Germany, pale mother!</i>

24
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,731
<i>What have your sons done to you...</i>

25
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:46,431
<i>that you sit among the peoples</i>
<i>a mockery or a threat!</i>

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,374
<i>Spoken by his daughter Hanne Hiob.</i>

27
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:58,513
GERMANY, PALE MOTHER

28
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,054
<i>I can remember nothing about</i>
<i>the time before my birth.</i>

29
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,458
<i>No blame can be attached to me</i>
<i>for events before my birth.</i>

30
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,719
<i>I didn't exist then.</i>

31
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,165
<i>I began when my father</i>
<i>first saw my mother.</i>

32
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,099
Hello, young lady.

33
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,844
Hey, honey! Turn round then!

34
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,576
But she's much too fat!

35
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,019
<i>He wasn't the Nazi.</i>
<i>That was the other one, his friend.</i>

36
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,759
Heil Hitler!

37
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,219
She didn't scream.

38
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,915
A real German woman.

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,584
With black hair?

40
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,184
Pure Aryan.

41
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,956
Her family’s all blonde.

42
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:26,097
She's the only one with black hair.
Seven beautiful sisters.

43
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,207
She didn't say a word.

44
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,767
I'm going to the rowing club dance
with her sister.

45
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,110
She's blonde. Corn-colored hair.

46
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,687
She's prettier,
only she's got black hair.

47
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,081
Look! A dead cat!

48
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,926
I can't stand cats.

49
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,224
Think that's unlucky?

50
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,200
Unlucky? How come?

51
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,341
<i>Mother.</i>

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,574
<i>I have learnt to be silent, you said.</i>

53
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:14,449
<i>You taught me to speak.</i>
<i>My mother tongue.</i>

54
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,005
He's still wearing turned-down socks,
the old socialist.

55
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,980
We'll soon make short work of them.

56
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:53,855
I don't know how you concentrate,
you talk such a lot.

57
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:02,331
I'm leaving anyway.
That'll stop all this bullying.

58
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,496
Have I bullied you?

59
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,469
It all depends how you look at it.

60
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,999
But you are staying?

61
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,211
I'm going to devote myself
to the Fatherland.

62
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,373
You mean you're going to work
for the party?

63
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,652
Look, that's Germany.

64
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,489
I can cover it with just my thumb.

65
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,327
We shall rule the world.

66
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,261
New York.

67
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,030
Show me that.

68
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,832
Victory or destruction.

69
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,703
I'm backing destruction.

70
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,140
Typical.

71
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,740
My father thinks the same.

72
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,913
He's a socialist, too.

73
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,382
At least you're not one.

74
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,045
I don't care.

75
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,949
I just want peace and the girl
with the black hair.

76
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,092
I want to live. Surely the Führer
can't be against that.

77
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:37,652
<i>My aunt, your sister, loved the Nazi.</i>
<i>Unfortunate.</i>

78
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:51,668
<i>But this is your love history</i>,
<i>my mother and father.</i>

79
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,336
- Are you in the party, too?
- No.

80
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,176
- Your sister is.
- Yes.

81
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,544
Can I see you again?

82
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,650
<i>Happy. Perfectly normal.</i>

83
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,522
<i>Only it happened at this time.</i>
<i>In this country.</i>

84
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,174
<i>The story of my beginning.</i>

85
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,577
Can I see you again?

86
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,813
- Are you in the party?
- No.

87
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,653
Why aren't you in the party?

88
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,250
Don't know. Can't I see you again?

89
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,090
Your friend’s in the party.

90
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,563
- Can I see you again if l join?
- No.

91
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,531
- No what?
- No.

92
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,397
Shouldn't l join or shouldn't I
see you again?

93
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,300
Answer my question then.

94
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,979
It's important to me.

95
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,716
The most important thing in the world.

96
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,408
Is something the matter with Ulrich?

97
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,450
He was at the Nazi congress.

98
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,813
So what?

99
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,756
He showed me a photo.
She's the girl for him, he said.

100
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,894
From Nuremberg. They are engaged.

101
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,094
You're far too good for Ulrich.
He's got no brains.

102
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,102
Yes he has!

103
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,600
Let him go.

104
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,932
It's easy for you to say that.

105
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,979
Shall I go back to my bed?

106
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,877
No, you can stay here.

107
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,662
That's coming from the Bernsteins!

108
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,560
That's Rachel!

109
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,868
- Let me go!
- Rachel, what's the matter?

110
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,569
But that's Rachel from my class!

111
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,967
I thought you were in the party.

112
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,410
But that's Rachel!

113
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,111
Come to bed. We'll think about Ulrich.

114
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,015
You can be so hard.

115
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,922
Switch on the light.

116
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,919
You've got a new bloke.

117
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,557
Who?

118
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,066
Not the Nazi, the other one.

119
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,027
I think I'll marry him.

120
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,003
Why? Stay here with me.

121
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,099
I'm getting too old for this place.

122
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,906
I don't want a party member,
and he does not belong.

123
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,449
Why don't you? They are smart.

124
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,743
Yes, perhaps that's why.

125
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,021
- Have you got a date with him?
- No.

126
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,881
Perhaps you won't see him again.

127
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,220
Of course I will!

128
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,325
What are you waiting for?

129
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,244
Oh, I forgot.

130
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,380
I wanted to carry you over.

131
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,918
It doesn't matter.

132
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,891
Like in a film.
Frau Meierholt next door said.

133
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,859
<i>You were young as she, my father.</i>

134
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:55,834
<i>But I remember your face always old</i>,
<i>like when you came back from the war...</i>

135
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,034
<i>they then sent you off to fight.</i>

136
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,765
I can't find the pin.

137
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,983
Let's get undressed.

138
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,400
<i>I cannot imagine your embrace...</i>

139
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:43,574
<i>or how your skins touched.</i>

140
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,119
<i>You are my parents, I am between you.</i>

141
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,555
<i>I did not marry.</i>

142
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,843
<i>I learnt that from you.</i>

143
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,169
At least there's no photo of Hitler
above the bed.

144
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,236
What?

145
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,009
Frau Meierholt says we need Hitler
above the bed.

146
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,310
Then our children will be better.

147
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,622
I thought you didn't want any.

148
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,633
I can't manage this, either.

149
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,102
Help me.

150
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,481
Heil Hitler on your birthday!

151
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,662
Our gifts are poor in comparison.

152
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,235
Newly washed?

153
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,330
I ironed them myself.

154
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,773
What a lot of work!

155
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,309
<i>Hitler: You know of my many attempts.</i>

156
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,748
Hear that? The Führer wants peace!

157
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,017
But I got this today.

158
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,559
The woman from Nuremberg is here.

159
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,098
Fine! You can be one of the first!

160
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,634
Han's call-up. He's sent to Poland.

161
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,499
Show me what it looks like.

162
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,245
I wanted to tell you tomorrow.

163
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,720
You're acting as if it were bad.

164
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,313
It is bad news.

165
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,890
The lovely carpet!

166
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,799
I'll make more tea.
Or would you prefer wine?

167
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,094
Wine.

168
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,195
To drink to your health...

169
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,079
Don't be so miserable.
Ill weeds grow apace.

170
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,984
It's only because he's a civil servant
they are sending him first.

171
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,921
So Ulrich will stay here?

172
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,452
There are other tasks to do here.

173
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,334
I wish I could go with you others.

174
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,234
Why didn't you join the party?
You should have joined.

175
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,338
Pull yourself together.

176
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,073
Please, pull yourself together.

177
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,763
<i>They sent you to kill</i>,

178
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,269
<i>but you weren't capable of that.</i>

179
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,304
<i>Who is?</i>

180
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,442
<i>My father.</i>

181
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,843
<i>Fatherland.</i>

182
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:34,955
Hey, you're blubbing!
A German soldier doesn't cry!

183
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,562
Pull yourself together, man!

184
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:48,639
I can't. She looked like my wife.
They didn't do us any harm.

185
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,642
Do you think it's any different
for us? Think we enjoy it?

186
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,770
I don't know.

187
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,249
- No, thanks. I don't need them.
- What, you do it without?

188
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,911
Mind you don't catch something!

189
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,718
I love my wife.

190
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,656
LOVE

191
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,664
Her husband has been killed.

192
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,337
She's going to the cemetery.

193
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,637
They gave him such a fine burial
yesterday.

194
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,438
We sent a wreath, too.

195
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,069
Turn off the radio.

196
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,480
Hans is still alive.

197
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,677
The last letter is two weeks old.

198
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,652
Ill weeds grow apace.

199
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,654
Please turn off the radio.

200
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,602
My red's used up. I need some more
from Duckstein's.

201
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,470
They've gone. They were Jews.

202
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,567
Jews! They were so old.

203
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,169
They were still Jews, all the same.

204
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,148
I need the red. No one else has it.

205
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,213
You're making that for when Hans
comes back.

206
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:28,926
Anyone there?

207
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,436
They've gone. There's no one there.

208
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:40,807
I need this red.
But you haven't a key, either?

209
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,903
The very idea!

210
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:47,508
I need it to finish my blouse.
I want it for when my husband comes.

211
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:59,829
<i>It is true. I believe you. You didn't</i>
<i>want it. But you didn't stop it.</i>

212
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,863
<i>I accuse you. But with what rights?</i>

213
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:10,237
<i>How am I better?</i>
<i>I was just lucky to be born later.</i>

214
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:21,510
I can't find it.

215
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,781
Then take another color.

216
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:30,358
Here's a nice blue. Light and navy.
Blue's much nicer.

217
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,861
You think so?

218
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,330
Much better.
So now be off with you!

219
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,481
What's the matter?

220
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,883
It's all too fast for me.

221
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,224
You were away so long, and now...

222
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,129
Do you like it?

223
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,997
What?

224
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,264
My blouse.

225
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,412
Am I so different for you?

226
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,594
I don't know...

227
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,473
I've traveled three days.
Just waiting for this moment.

228
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,940
I can't help it.

229
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,326
You've been with another man.

230
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,661
That Nazi.

231
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,332
The swine that stayed at home.

232
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,459
No.

233
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,868
You're lying.

234
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,466
I'm not!

235
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,705
How am I to know that?

236
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,982
I thought you were as pure
as virgin snow.

237
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,826
I haven't touched another woman.

238
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,068
And you?

239
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,504
I really haven't.
Not even looked at another man.

240
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,443
I know that.

241
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,853
I couldn't.

242
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,445
I know that.

243
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,116
I want a child from you.

244
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,460
A part of you here when you're away.

245
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,378
Don't you want children?

246
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,659
Yes, if that's what you want.

247
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,316
Why must you go back?
Poland has been defeated.

248
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,718
I have to go to France.

249
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,061
Where then? Paris?

250
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,299
<i>She looked like my mother</i>, 
<i>like Lene.</i>

251
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:54,838
Look, my wife. She looks like you.

252
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,437
Shall I line you up too?

253
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,318
Deneuve, Patrice,
born February 21, 1921.

254
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,429
Constant, Annick,
born December 17, 1920.

255
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:17,764
Jennot, Philippe,
born March 24, 1919.

256
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:22,271
Duchamp, Jean-Claude,
born November 7, 1920.

257
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,332
Thierry, Michael,
born June 12, 1921.

258
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,977
Bouché, Gilles,
born October 30, 1918.

259
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,380
Marchaud, Jean-Luc,
born September 1, 1919.

260
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,481
<i>Looking back, I can say one thing.</i>

261
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:48,189
<i>The past two years have been</i>
<i>decisive in the war's outcome.</i>

262
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:57,633
<i>Our first opponent was removed</i>
<i>in a few weeks.</i>

263
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:04,279
<i>Norway's attempts to stop our</i>
<i>supplies were also foiled.</i>

264
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,554
<i>Attempts to reach the Ruhr failed.</i>

265
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,527
<i>France has also been overcome.</i>

266
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:26,501
<i>England has been chased away</i>
<i>from the continent.</i>

267
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:34,777
<i>Consider whether England intends</i>
<i>to start her coup with a major offensive.</i>

268
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:41,375
<i>They only have to tell me when</i>
<i>and I'll clear the area in advance.</i>

269
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,658
Fire!

270
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,022
It's coming again.

271
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:26,256
More! Nice deep breaths!
Breathe in!

272
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:31,257
Breathe in! No, breathe in!

273
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,659
Almost there now.

274
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,668
Now push at the next contraction.
Together, now!

275
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,473
Head on your chest and push!

276
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,781
Fine, the head's already there!

277
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,162
Now nice, deep breaths!

278
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,072
The head's there. One more push!

279
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,766
Heil Hitler! A girl!

280
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:26,169
A girl! No fine boy!

281
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,074
It's so strange for me.

282
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,683
<i>As they cut me free from you</i>
<i>I fell onto a battlefield.</i>

283
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,621
<i>So much I hadn't seen</i>
<i>was already destroyed.</i>

284
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:59,801
It's 3 a.m. We're rolling east.
Only the stars seem to be awake.

285
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,007
They play their silver light on men
who soon must be at the front again.

286
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,517
Each turn of the wheels
brings us nearer.

287
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,418
Our third day traveling.

288
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:21,495
A cold wind blows, the trucks rattle.

289
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,559
The doors don't shut.
There's drafts everywhere.

290
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,920
Ice on the windows.

291
00:38:55,366 --> 00:39:00,599
A hole in the ice reveals the white,
open terrain of the east.

292
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:07,075
<i>There we are now on our long march</i>
<i>in the lonely landscape.</i>

293
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:13,478
<i>These men will have no Christmas.</i>
<i>But their hearts are at home.</i>

294
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:17,520
<i>Calling Stalingrad again.</i>

295
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,953
<i>Here is Stalingrad. The Volga front.</i>

296
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,927
<i>The Lapland front again.</i>

297
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,294
<i>The barracks in Finland here.</i>

298
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,166
<i>South of France again, the Luftwaffe.</i>

299
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,198
<i>Here is an airfield</i>
<i>in the South of France.</i>

300
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,606
<i>The navy again.</i>
<i>Army, South of France.</i>

301
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:46,007
<i>A watch-out on the French Riviera.</i>

302
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,278
<i>Here is the front in the Caucasus.</i>

303
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,845
<i>U- Boat commands in the Atlantic</i>
<i>come in.</i>

304
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:56,188
<i>A U-boat station in the Atlantic ocean.</i>

305
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,131
<i>Here is the Mediterranean front</i>
<i>and Africa.</i>

306
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,428
<i>Attention: Here is Zakopane.</i>

307
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:08,471
<i>From the military convalescent</i>
<i>home in the Tatras we greet...</i>

308
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,268
<i>our comrades at the front.</i>

309
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:18,013
<i>Please join in this old</i>
<i>German Christmas carol.</i>

310
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:41,937
<i>All stations join in this</i>
<i>spontaneous wish from comrades...</i>

311
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,008
<i>in the Tatras...</i>

312
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:50,413
<i>They are singing in Finland</i>
<i>and the Arctic</i>,

313
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,315
<i>in the battle region of Witebsk...</i>

314
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:59,983
<i>and we now bring all together</i>,

315
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:06,458
<i>Leningrad, Stalingrad, France...</i>

316
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,803
<i>and now Africa...</i>

317
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,307
<i>and now they are all singing...</i>

318
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,603
<i>this old German carol.</i>

319
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:39,518
<i>If the enemy thought he could sap</i>
<i>our spirit with a few attacks...</i>

320
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,528
<i>He was wrong. They were and are...</i>

321
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,933
<i>a signal for total war...</i>

322
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,707
<i>In Germany we shall no longer speak...</i>

323
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,942
<i>of lost comforts.</i>

324
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,560
Quiet!

325
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,326
They are going mad.

326
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,776
Have you already heard from
your sweetheart?

327
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,009
He wrote from the east front.

328
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,516
In Russia?

329
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,183
Have a drop of this, love.

330
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:22,126
Do you good. Never tasted it before?

331
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,732
Got lice?

332
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,639
You get used to anything.

333
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,042
Rather have lice and be alive...

334
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,042
that no lice and be dead.

335
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:46,488
Don't go and leave
our little group, dearie.

336
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,447
Calm yourself.

337
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,267
That was our house,

338
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,044
and that was me once.

339
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,420
We've only the Berlin relatives now.

340
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,418
We can wait for your father there.

341
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,164
Perhaps he's still alive.

342
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:07,393
He's bound to be alive still.
You hear? He's alive all right.

343
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:10,972
He's got to be alive.

344
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:20,643
<i>After the bomb wrecked the house...</i>

345
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,754
<i>we felt really cheerful, you and me.</i>

346
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:40,294
<i>To Berlin on foot, in high heels</i>,

347
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,406
<i>vagabond Lene and me.</i>

348
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,543
Stop it, or I'll lose the case.

349
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,186
Our silver's in there... all we have.

350
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,962
How do I get to Halensee from here?

351
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,899
The bus from Zoo station.

352
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,701
Where's your family then?

353
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,705
Disappeared. I'm looking for them.

354
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,651
How long then?

355
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:31,921
Six weeks.

356
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,741
I'm looking for the Fritzens.

357
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,867
That's their furniture.

358
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,146
I mean Dr. Fritzens,
from the Air Ministry.

359
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,013
Yes, that's him.

360
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,448
Are they moving house in Berlin?

361
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,758
No, they are going to the country.

362
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,327
Hello, who's there?

363
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,500
Oh, little Lene!

364
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,138
<i>They were the rich relations.</i>

365
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,143
<i>I couldn't stand them, even then.</i>

366
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,179
I thought we could stay here.

367
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:39,178
But we are moving.

368
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,423
Why? Bertrand's got such a good job.

369
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:55,504
He's not too well, he wants to get
away to the countryside.

370
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,476
Come in anyway.

371
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,242
He's upstairs.

372
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,782
Leave them where they are.

373
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,720
She wanted to stay here.

374
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:22,128
Hans is coming here next week
and she wanted to try to meet him.

375
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,597
That's all right.

376
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,669
The flat will be empty for a while.

377
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:31,834
We have a few things still to do
in Berlin.

378
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,106
But we're going to a hotel.

379
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:41,615
Lene can stay here if she wants.

380
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:46,546
Isn't someone moving in here?

381
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,091
Not at once. We aren't just nobody!

382
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,093
I'd so like to bathe with the baby.

383
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:54,189
Go ahead.

384
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,462
The maid's still here.

385
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,008
She'll run the bath for you.

386
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,673
Go on, eat some more.

387
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,415
Chew 32 times for each bite.

388
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,383
Always the same.

389
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:30,790
One chew for each tooth.

390
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,828
Your teeth are o.k.,
better than mine.

391
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,839
32 times!

392
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,882
Look, another sponge!

393
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,122
<i>So Lene and I loved each other</i>
<i>in the bath</i>,

394
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,531
<i>and flew like witches over the roofs.</i>

395
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,004
- Perhaps they'll still come.
- Perhaps not.

396
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:23,880
I'm waiting for my husband,
230th Infantry Regiment.

397
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,811
They definitely came this morning.

398
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,350
They're already in the barracks.

399
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,216
I'm waiting for my wife.

400
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,157
She's bound to come.
The trains don't run frequently.

401
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,591
Best of luck!

402
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,939
<i>Lene and I in the midst of war.</i>

403
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:31,976
Is the troop transport here
which arrived this morning?

404
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:36,178
I'm looking for my husband,
230th Infantry Regiment.

405
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,855
They didn't arrive.

406
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,150
The man at the station said so.

407
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,852
Well, they're not here.

408
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,021
Heil, Hitler!

409
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:11,982
Give me a cuddle!

410
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,590
Where can we go? I've two days off.

411
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,463
Two days? So long?

412
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:51,616
Again?

413
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:06,899
Come here!

414
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:13,849
<i>I want to sing with you in Monte Carlo...</i>

415
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,884
<i>under the palm trees</i>,

416
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,625
<i>if you can't see heaven for palm trees</i>,
<i>you can't find heaven with me.</i>

417
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:33,998
<i>What was I to do with a father?</i>

418
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,947
<i>I wanted to be a witch amongst</i>
<i>the ruins with Lene.</i>

419
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,261
You're all right,

420
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,563
you can still dance.

421
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,433
Dance with us!

422
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,222
I can't. I'm not in the mood.

423
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:37,897
Our house was bombed.

424
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:47,709
That was in the shelter,
all that was left.

425
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,017
Can you imagine having a baby
in an air raid?

426
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,652
The worse it gets, the more I sing.

427
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,589
Not so much for the child as for me.

428
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,738
You've changed so much.

429
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,440
You think so?

430
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,546
And I'm still the same.

431
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,181
Just more worn out.

432
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:43,456
<i>What should my father do with me?</i>

433
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,192
I saw how she started to live.

434
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,234
Her struggle to live.

435
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,572
How she raised her head and arms,

436
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,908
and how she first kneeled.

437
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,313
And then stood up.

438
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,721
First she could stand,
now she walks.

439
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,296
Somehow that was more important than
the whole war... for me at least.

440
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,838
We shall fight to the last man.

441
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,702
What?

442
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,207
Victory...

443
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,349
or destruction.

444
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,446
That is worthy of the German people.

445
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:44,687
Yes, and Bertrand's leaving the city.
The officials know what'll happen.

446
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:49,697
Don't let them take you in now,
you must live, that's all.

447
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,831
<i>I was jealous of him and he of me.</i>

448
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,904
<i>Here is the Berlin observation post.</i>

449
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,442
We must go to the shelter.

450
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:12,544
Not for every little thing,
only when the warning goes.

451
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,052
They're disappearing again.

452
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,237
Her screaming gets on my nerves.

453
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,552
<i>Just what I wanted.</i>

454
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,330
<i>But not him.</i>

455
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,179
<i>I don't know him.</i>

456
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,422
Must she stay here all night?

457
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:27,788
Yes, she's so nervous because of
the air raids, it keeps her quiet.

458
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,170
I would have liked to hold you.

459
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,603
Let's sleep. We are all tired.

460
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,944
It's like heaven,
to have a night without a raid.

461
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,221
Let's go to sleep.

462
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,410
You should stop breast-feeding.

463
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,777
But there's nothing else.

464
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,544
But she's eating you up.

465
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,548
Perhaps.

466
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:34,493
I often think, when she is young...

467
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,934
we'll be old and our faces will
show what we went through.

468
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,536
And she'll have forgotten it all.

469
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:50,979
Sometimes I envy her,

470
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:58,253
and then I think,
she takes all my strength.

471
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,890
She gets fat and I get thinner.

472
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:13,666
When I've finished this I'll go.

473
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,911
Go to the countryside.
I'll be reassured then.

474
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,778
Saxony, Silesia, all's quiet there.

475
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,687
You can't stay here in Berlin.

476
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,087
I thought we were winning.

477
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,734
How do you know she'll still be alive
when it's over?

478
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,533
I don't know, l just think so.

479
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,238
I'm off now.

480
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:29,805
My will is in the envelope
in the suitcase.

481
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,005
Goodbye.

482
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,012
He's gone, gone away.

483
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,546
<i>Our Führer Adolf Hitler died today...</i>

484
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:59,048
<i>in the Chancery while fighting...</i>

485
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,384
<i>against Bolshevism.</i>

486
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:07,292
<i>Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home.</i>

487
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,700
<i>Your house is on fire...</i>

488
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,668
<i>and your children are alone.</i>

489
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,540
<i>Fly away!</i>

490
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,955
<i>Dönitz, Hitler's successor...</i>

491
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:35,250
<i>will address the German people.</i>

492
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,588
<i>German men...</i>

493
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:41,288
<i>and women.</i>

494
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,331
<i>Soldiers of the Wehrmacht.</i>

495
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,128
There once lived a miller,

496
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:52,503
he wanted to find a husband
for his beautiful daughter.

497
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:58,213
He decided that the first suitable
man who asked...

498
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,147
could marry his daughter.

499
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:06,711
Sure enough a suitor came,
and as he seemed rich...

500
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:12,289
and the father could find no fault
in him he was promised the daughter.

501
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:19,199
But she didn't seem to love him
as a bride should love her husband.

502
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,572
And whenever she saw him
or thought of him...

503
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,636
her heart was heavy.

504
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:32,909
One day the bridegroom said
to his betrothed:

505
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:37,111
"You have been my betrothed for so long
and you have never visited me."

506
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:41,316
The girl said,
"I don't know where your house is"

507
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,484
He replied. "Deep in the forest.

508
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,322
You must visit me on Sunday.
I have invited some friends.

509
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,968
To help you find the way I will scatter
the path with ashes."

510
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,953
When the day came for the girl
to visit him...

511
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,560
fear crept over her.

512
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:25,864
She filled pockets with dried
peas and set off.

513
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,839
At the edge of the woods...

514
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:35,368
she found the path with ashes
and followed.

515
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,776
As she went...

516
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,541
she scattered the peas to her left
and to her right.

517
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,584
She walked all day...

518
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,761
until she reached the darkest part
of the forest.

519
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:00,427
There stood a lone, strange house...

520
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,495
and the girl was very afraid.

521
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:07,508
But she went into the house.
There was no one there.

522
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,134
All was silent.

523
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:19,487
A voice called suddenly:
"Turn around, young lady, turn around!

524
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:21,488
You're in a murderer's house!"

525
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:26,685
And the girl turned around
and saw a bird.

526
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:34,592
The bird called again:
"Turn around, young lady!

527
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:36,465
You're in a murderer's house!"

528
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:42,567
The girl ran through every room
until she reached the cellar.

529
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,476
An old, old lady sat there.

530
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:50,683
The girl asked her,

531
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:55,923
"Old lady, do you know if my
bridegroom lives here?"

532
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,822
The old lady begun to moan and said,

533
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:03,695
"Poor child, you are in the house
of a murderer.

534
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:12,539
You think that you are to be his bride,
but you will be the bride of death.

535
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:19,475
Your bridegroom will come back,
chop you into little pieces...

536
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:23,643
and then cook your body
and then gobble you up!

537
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,214
If I didn't pity you,
you would have no chance."

538
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:34,152
Then the old woman hid the girl
behind a big barrel and said,

539
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:38,893
"When the robbers are asleep we can
escape. I've waited long to escape."

540
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,333
As she finished speaking...

541
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:48,208
Aren't you hungry?

542
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,208
The robbers came home, quite drunk.

543
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,084
A young girl was with them.

544
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:03,756
She moaned and screamed.
The robbers gave her 3 glasses of wine.

545
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:08,395
White wine, red wine and yellow.

546
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,756
Her heart stopped beating.

547
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,899
The robbers tore off her clothes,

548
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:18,269
chopped her body into little pieces
and flavored them with salt.

549
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:23,344
A robber found a ring on one
of the girl's fingers.

550
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:30,342
He couldn't pull off the ring,
so he chopped off the finger.

551
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,320
The finger fell from the table...

552
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,849
and landed behind the barrel
right on the girl's lap!

553
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:46,097
The robbers wanted to look for the
finger but the old woman said,

554
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:50,865
"Don't bother with the finger.
Drink a draught from the good wine."

555
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:57,273
The old woman had put sleeping powder
in the wine. They fell asleep.

556
01:11:58,547 --> 01:12:02,449
Then the girl sprang from behind
the barrel and ran away.

557
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,722
She was afraid a robber would awake,
but God helped her escape...

558
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:13,352
from the house with the old woman.

559
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:22,033
The wind had blown the ashes away.
But the peas had sprouted plants.

560
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:29,270
I want to see!

561
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:48,997
She found her way
by means of the pea shoots...

562
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,961
and the moonlight.

563
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:00,335
The next day she reached the mill.

564
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:05,343
The girl told her father everything
that had happened.

565
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,216
On the wedding day the robber appeared.

566
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,585
The father had invited many guests.

567
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,697
Each guest had to tell a story
after the dinner.

568
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:29,236
The girl sat perfectly still and silent.
The bridegroom said,

569
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:32,569
"Don't you have a story to tell?"

570
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,008
She said,
"I'll tell you about my dream.

571
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,510
I walked through a forest
until I found a house.

572
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:47,719
There wasn't a soul there. A bird called,

573
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:52,188
"Turn back! You are
in a murderer's house!"

574
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:55,424
It was only a dream.

575
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,062
I went to the cellar of the house.

576
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:06,373
An old lady sat there.

577
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,743
I asked if my bridegroom
lived in the house.

578
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:16,544
The old woman replied,
"You poor child.

579
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,353
Your bridegroom lives here.

580
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:25,750
But when he returns, he'll kill you
and cook you and gobble you up!"

581
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,293
It was just a dream I had.

582
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,928
The old woman hid me behind a barrel...

583
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,335
and then the robbers returned.

584
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:41,775
They had captured a young maiden.
They gave her wine to drink,

585
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:45,340
white, red and yellow wine.

586
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,440
It made her heart stop beating.

587
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,812
It was only a dream."

588
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:32,939
The victors' right, little girl.

589
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,081
They rob and take women.

590
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,688
It was only a dream.

591
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:56,160
One robber found a ring
on the dead girl's finger.

592
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:01,799
He took an axe and chopped off
the finger.

593
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:07,480
The finger fell from the table and
fell into my lap, behind the barrel.

594
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,351
And here is the finger with the ring.

595
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:14,411
And saying this she pulled out
the finger and showed it to them.

596
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:21,855
The robber, now white as chalk,
jumped up and ran away.

597
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:32,838
The guests caught him and handed
him over to the police.

598
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:38,712
And his robbers were punished
for their ill deeds.

599
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:03,394
Cigarettes for silver?

600
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:25,193
Eggs in exchange for cigarettes?

601
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,103
Eggs for cigarettes?

602
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,553
<i>That was all in ruins, too.</i>

603
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:06,496
<i>Here is the last military report</i>
<i>of the war.</i>

604
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,971
<i>Headquarters report:</i>

605
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:14,405
<i>Cease-fire on all fronts since midnight.</i>

606
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:18,673
<i>On the General's orders</i>
<i>fighting has ceased.</i>

607
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:23,240
<i>There will now be a three minute break</i>
<i>in transmission.</i>

608
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,426
Hans is in Greece?

609
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:37,692
Yes... his old dream.

610
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,602
Not quite how he imagined it.

611
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:51,342
I can see him standing there,
reciting from <i>The Iliad.</i>

612
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,470
He'll be back soon then.

613
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,175
I'm looking forward to it.

614
01:20:58,286 --> 01:20:59,480
Of course.

615
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:01,181
Of course?

616
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,350
Why not then?

617
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:06,153
I don't know.

618
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,392
I've been alone with the child so long.

619
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:32,518
The things they see!

620
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:50,134
<i>What should we expect from peace?</i>

621
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:54,797
<i>To begin with, clearing up</i>
<i>after the war was fun.</i>

622
01:21:56,177 --> 01:22:01,137
<i>But the stones we broke up formed</i>
<i>houses worse than the old ones.</i>

623
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:05,717
<i>If we'd known that, Lene...</i>

624
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,320
Yes, that's good.

625
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:12,582
Don't take any of their nonsense!

626
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:57,362
Is she asleep?

627
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,794
Yes, she is.

628
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,735
At this hour?

629
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,377
It's for us, three times.

630
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:13,463
I'm your father.

631
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:14,667
Yes?

632
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,403
- Give him a kiss.
- No!

633
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:20,606
Let it be.

634
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:26,751
Come with me.

635
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,061
Are you hungry?

636
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:17,392
I can't.

637
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:18,897
It doesn't matter.

638
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:33,237
I can't either.

639
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:56,402
It's been too long since.

640
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:12,547
Too long.

641
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:24,355
Tomorrow.

642
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:31,497
Tomorrow.

643
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,591
Till we get used to each other.

644
01:28:58,266 --> 01:28:59,858
I must re-accustom myself.

645
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:06,866
It's slowly all taking shape.

646
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:09,340
There are still mines everywhere.

647
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:35,628
Old friend!

648
01:29:38,106 --> 01:29:39,698
I'm still alive, too!

649
01:29:39,807 --> 01:29:41,274
So I see.

650
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:44,243
De-nazified!

651
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:46,279
I was never in the party.

652
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,644
You had the good sense.

653
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:51,844
No, more by chance, to be honest.

654
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:54,310
Yes, the criminals.

655
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:55,320
Who?

656
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:57,152
The Nazis, who else?

657
01:29:58,526 --> 01:29:59,493
Oh, I see.

658
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,725
This is my daughter.

659
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,369
Go and tell Daddy he's a weirdo.

660
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:16,104
You're a weirdo!

661
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:44,104
No sense of humor.

662
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,600
<i>The return of family life.</i>

663
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:28,341
<i>We started inside while outside</i>
<i>there was peace.</i>

664
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,027
Write neatly!

665
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:51,536
She must write neatly.

666
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:52,901
Leave her alone.

667
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:07,651
The looks you give!

668
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:16,964
As if someone had done you harm.

669
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,708
During the war I always thought
of afterwards.

670
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,274
Now it's afterwards and like this.

671
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,787
You had another man.

672
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:53,191
No!

673
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:03,068
I know you did.

674
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:10,712
- Therefore your behavior.
- How dare you!

675
01:33:10,818 --> 01:33:12,786
No, stop!
Leave her alone!

676
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:15,181
I'm exhausted.

677
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,841
I'm going to bed. Leave me alone.

678
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,433
You're to go, too!

679
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,732
I've been promoted.

680
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:26,946
Because I wasn't in the party.

681
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:53,638
What's the matter?

682
01:37:01,382 --> 01:37:03,043
I don't know.

683
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:07,410
It came suddenly.

684
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:27,997
But why?

685
01:37:31,445 --> 01:37:32,844
It's nothing.

686
01:37:41,989 --> 01:37:43,889
We'll go to the doctor's.

687
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:59,065
Don't move till we get back!

688
01:38:42,116 --> 01:38:45,210
It's her teeth.
I'll have to extract them all.

689
01:38:49,023 --> 01:38:50,456
No, I don't want that.

690
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:53,585
Please don't. Please.

691
01:38:54,028 --> 01:38:55,359
Are you the husband?

692
01:38:56,163 --> 01:39:00,031
If not, I can't guarantee
the paralysis won't spread.

693
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:05,034
It can affect the whole body,
and then I can't promise anything.

694
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:08,666
You must do what you think is right.

695
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,537
Life is more important.

696
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:05,503
I've made some soup, you must eat.

697
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:20,588
Mommy!

698
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:50,372
For what we are about to receive
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

699
01:44:59,192 --> 01:45:00,887
It's facial paralysis.

700
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,497
Yes, we were right at the time.

701
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,731
It was a bold chance, but it worked.

702
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:16,205
I don't see the connection.

703
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:21,338
The Air Ministry and now the Church.

704
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:25,781
I studied law and theology.

705
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:31,217
So easy.

706
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:12,795
It's all right, don't cry.
I'll clear it up.

707
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:27,375
I just wonder how you organize
your thoughts though.

708
01:46:29,716 --> 01:46:35,018
I am an administrator.
I don't preach from the Bible.

709
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:44,023
I'm an administrator.

710
01:46:44,131 --> 01:46:45,894
Pass the bottle.

711
01:46:49,603 --> 01:46:51,036
Thank you.

712
01:46:52,139 --> 01:46:55,540
You need law for administration.

713
01:46:55,642 --> 01:46:59,806
For my job with the Nazis and also
my present job,

714
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:02,541
it didn't hurt to have
studied theology.

715
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:09,813
I always considered the metaphysical
in my free time.

716
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:14,917
It was my hobby, so to speak,
and now it's my profession.

717
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:24,660
Are the ladies going to return?
If not I'll light up.

718
01:47:26,373 --> 01:47:28,739
I'm sensitive to smells.

719
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:41,284
<i>Little Hans down a hole</i>,
<i>fast asleep.</i>

720
01:47:47,327 --> 01:47:51,423
<i>Are you ill, little Hans?</i>

721
01:47:51,531 --> 01:47:54,523
<i>You can't jump any more?</i>

722
01:47:57,370 --> 01:48:00,362
Jump, Hans, jump!

723
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,057
Give me some.

724
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:24,791
<i>Adenauer: The Federal Government</i>
<i>thinks that West Germany...</i>

725
01:48:26,066 --> 01:48:28,466
The worst liqueur ever.

726
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:34,372
<i>... must have suitable defenses...</i>

727
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:37,568
It's Maundy Thursday.

728
01:48:38,678 --> 01:48:41,545
<i>... to preserve Europe's cultural values.</i>

729
01:48:42,015 --> 01:48:45,473
The old winter with its weakness...

730
01:48:47,220 --> 01:48:50,087
drew back to the mountains.

731
01:48:51,658 --> 01:48:54,422
From there it sends forth...

732
01:48:55,829 --> 01:49:00,960
showers of ice above the green lea.

733
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:07,905
The sun permits no white to remain.

734
01:49:12,679 --> 01:49:16,638
Everywhere stirs education...

735
01:49:21,254 --> 01:49:22,585
and striving.

736
01:49:24,324 --> 01:49:27,851
<i>We the German Social Democrats...</i>

737
01:49:32,365 --> 01:49:34,230
Adenauer will manage it.

738
01:49:42,275 --> 01:49:44,368
We'll soon be someone again.

739
01:49:52,786 --> 01:49:54,879
Ulrich is getting promoted.

740
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:07,028
A bit better than Hans.

741
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:28,581
That was quick, old boy.

742
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:32,553
Ruddy quick.

743
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:38,253
They can't turn down qualified men.

744
01:50:38,365 --> 01:50:40,629
- You reckon you're qualified?
- Yes!

745
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:51,567
<i>Strauss: Europe can't be neutral.</i>

746
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:53,168
Qualified...

747
01:51:41,161 --> 01:51:44,426
You can have it all. All of it.

748
01:51:58,011 --> 01:52:00,775
Buried, hidden from the enemy.

749
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:05,717
I don't need it anymore.
I don't want it.

750
01:52:07,787 --> 01:52:09,778
I need love!

751
01:52:12,892 --> 01:52:15,588
Love is what I need!

752
01:52:18,465 --> 01:52:21,798
You've got love. You have, truly.

753
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:29,574
You've ruined everything for me.
You want to kill me.

754
01:52:34,981 --> 01:52:36,642
I'll kill you.

755
01:52:47,393 --> 01:52:50,191
I've got a test at school tomorrow.

756
01:52:50,296 --> 01:52:52,025
Let the child sleep.

757
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:56,997
Yes, you just sleep, and I'm dying!...

758
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:13,178
Please, Mommy, go back to bed.

759
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:43,942
Please, Mommy, go back to bed.

760
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:19,746
I don't want to live anymore.

761
01:54:22,288 --> 01:54:25,052
Do what you want,
I've enough problems.

762
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:31,060
Ulrich has been promoted again,
they've forgotten me.

763
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:34,497
I am more capable.

764
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:43,370
No one believes it, least of all you.

765
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:53,448
I don't want to live anymore.

766
01:54:55,455 --> 01:54:56,717
Neither do I.

767
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:23,803
Open the door, Mommy.

768
01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:27,303
Please open the door.

769
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:35,454
Come out, please.

770
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:56,967
I am so alone, don't leave me alone.

771
01:58:32,338 --> 01:58:35,774
<i>It was a long time before Lene</i>
<i>opened the door.</i>

772
01:58:37,543 --> 01:58:40,273
<i>Sometimes I think she's still behind it.</i>

773
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:43,438
<i>And I'm still standing outside...</i>

774
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:46,743
<i>and she'll never come out to me.</i>

775
01:58:48,554 --> 01:58:51,421
<i>And I must be grown up</i>
<i>and alone.</i>

776
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:58,526
<i>But she is still there.</i>
<i>Lene is still there.</i>

777
02:00:19,145 --> 02:00:24,481
On the one side this story is for Lene
and on the other side, for Anna.
