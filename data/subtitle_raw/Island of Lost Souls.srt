1
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,334
It happened a long time ago.

2
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,330
And now that I shouldn't
be afraid anymore,

3
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,123
I'm going to tell it bit
by bit, as I remember it.

4
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,340
What happens to a man when he leads a life

5
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,650
where goodness doesn't exist, and at times

6
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,653
he feels like his heart will burst.

7
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Your life is no longer yours.

8
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,223
You aren't free anymore.

9
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,793
And your claws can't do any harm.

10
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,180
Prison is so bitter and
there's such a taste

11
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,783
of viciousness within its walls.

12
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,260
This is our story, the men who have spent

13
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,373
many years filled with loneliness.

14
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,533
Do you know what a madrone is?

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,150
It's a tree that each month, when the moon

16
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,450
moves across the heavens
like a silver cat's tail,

17
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,110
the witches come to visit,
and in the good trees,

18
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,743
they cast their spells of joy.

19
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:12,370
And the folks that know
say, the ones whose hair

20
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,060
is as white as corn silk,
that at every new moon,

21
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,570
the flowers of the madrone tree

22
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,370
are full of the enchantment and good luck

23
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,670
that the witches left
on their previous visit.

24
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,380
And that's why I went to
the mountain and came back

25
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,743
with a bunch of madrone
flowers for Maria Lena.

26
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,350
She was so fair, and
her eyes were so bright,

27
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,090
with the clearness in light of the clouds

28
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,140
in the afternoon sky of an Indian summer.

29
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,233
She had a timeless beauty.

30
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,640
There was a man who pursued her harder

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,910
than all the others put together,

32
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,083
and he was respectfully called Don Miguel.

33
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,303
- Take my horse.

34
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,023
- I can't read.

35
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,690
- Doesn't matter.

36
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,190
I'm a friend of the president.

37
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,793
And as of this moment, the
supreme authority of this pueblo.

38
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,630
Tell that to everyone.

39
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,674
The supreme authority.

40
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,540
Her hair was
blond and so beautiful.

41
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,460
Many times in my memory, I
compared it to a ray of sunshine

42
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,660
resting on a rock in
the middle of a stream.

43
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:39,220
It was also long and
soft, like the pretty silk

44
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,020
that grows around the begonias
on the edge of the marsh.

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,480
- May the Lord be with
you, Senor Martinez.

46
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,420
- Afternoon, Juanito, come on in.

47
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,850
- I'm going to put the flowers in a vase.

48
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,730
- Did you hear we've got
a new supreme authority?

49
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,990
Guess it's the man who came on horseback.

50
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,310
- Hope he does good.

51
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,950
Now that the president gave
him so much power over us.

52
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,270
I don't know why he needs
authority in a place

53
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,231
where nothing ever happens.

54
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,680
Whenever we went to a dance,

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,400
and the ranchers around there gave parties

56
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
on every occasion they can think of.

57
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,820
I remember I had suffered
a lot because the older men

58
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,220
watched her and flirted
with her in front of me.

59
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,140
They spoke to her with ease and charm

60
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,950
like I'd never been able to do,

61
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,030
with those fine phrases
and the compliments

62
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,080
I knew nothing about.

63
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,993
- Good day, Mary Elena.

64
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,930
- Good day, Don Miguel.

65
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,920
- Did you have fun last night?

66
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,880
- The music was very beautiful.

67
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,300
- No more than you.

68
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,810
And I dreamed about you
in my sleep last night.

69
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,143
And it was lovely having you in my dreams.

70
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,453
This morning I thought, Miguel,

71
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,420
you really ought to make
those dreams come true.

72
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,370
How about doing it?

73
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,678
What?

74
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,283
Have you gone deaf and dumb?

75
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,110
You'll have time to laugh when you learn

76
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,918
that love's a good thing.

77
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,750
- Did my daughter tell
you about Don Miguel?

78
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,910
- Yes.

79
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,390
- Why don't you get married?

80
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,370
Elena's 15 years old now.

81
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,820
As your wife, he'll stop
bothering her so much,

82
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,620
and soon he'll be able to forget her.

83
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,283
- Yes, but first let me get
together a little money for us.

84
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,970
- Good day, Senor Martinez.

85
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,590
- May God always be with you, Senor.

86
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,740
- Good day, Don Miguel.

87
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,400
- How's my little pigeon, Mary Elena?

88
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,490
- Pretty good.

89
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,640
Pretty good.

90
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,040
Every day a bit more lovely.

91
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,870
- So I've noticed.

92
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,770
She's about the right
age for a man, I'd say.

93
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,210
- Yes.

94
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,440
She'll be marrying Juanito soon.

95
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,273
- Juanito?

96
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,070
He's still a baby chick.

97
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,430
That little pigeon will have to mate

98
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,698
with a rooster of experience.

99
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,551
- How many stars do you
think there are in the sky?

100
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:07,460
- About a hundred.

101
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,320
- No, there are many more.

102
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,140
And when we learn to count
to more than a hundred,

103
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,973
we'll know.

104
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,800
- You better start counting

105
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:17,105
- One.

106
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,610
Two.

107
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,523
Three.

108
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:22,537
Four.

109
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:25,721
- Five.
- Yes.

110
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,086
- Six.

111
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,336
Seven.

112
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,523
- Honey.
- 22.

113
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,420
- May the Lord be with you, Don Miguel.

114
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,410
- What are you doing here?

115
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,380
- Taking a walk, Don Miguel.

116
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,040
- I'm sure you're lying.

117
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,520
She's coming with me under arrest.

118
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,420
- Don't touch her!

119
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,019
- Don't be such a tiger
with my women, pretty boy.

120
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,118
- Don't kill him!

121
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:47,011
Juanito!

122
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:49,528
Help me!

123
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:54,611
Juanito!

124
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,090
- Don Miguel.

125
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,040
- What do you want?

126
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,133
- Where's my daughter?

127
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,600
Tell me, for the love of God.

128
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,460
- You want to take her home?

129
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,210
- The only thing I want is
to be able to see her again.

130
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,283
- She's at the Juarez ranch, go get her.

131
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,523
- Don Miguel.

132
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,210
A maiden cannot be taken and
violated the way you did.

133
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,713
I ask you to please restore her honor.

134
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,093
- You're right.

135
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,160
The leftover women were
made for all the men

136
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,713
who were born weaklings.

137
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,600
So tell that cow herd Juanito to marry her

138
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,150
the way God wishes.

139
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,630
And I don't want to see
him around here again,

140
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,300
because the next time I
do, I'll use my machete

141
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,820
on him where it hurts.

142
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,283
- As for Mary Elena, there's
nothing to do about it.

143
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,173
What's happened now?

144
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,660
- I saw that man.

145
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,120
- Where's Mary Elena?

146
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,307
- I'll tell you the way he told me,

147
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,760
- "Tell that cow head Juanito
that I'm giving her back

148
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,120
so that he can marry her as God wishes.

149
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,400
He has to go for her at the Juarez ranch,

150
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,300
and he must leave the pueblo forever."

151
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,003
If you still love her and
want her, I'll go with you.

152
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:34,780
It's the same
today as it was in that moment.

153
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,630
It's as if it had happened yesterday.

154
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,200
Everything that happened I
still have locked in my brain

155
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,463
like something that you
can't and you mustn't forget.

156
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,470
Behind us, the wind continued to cry

157
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,800
as it passed through the trees,

158
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,007
as if it were trying to
scream about a hidden sorrow.

159
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,710
The rest of the afternoon
I spent with my heart

160
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,360
stuck in the middle of my throat.

161
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,953
I had never even learned to cry,

162
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,713
to find a release for my feelings.

163
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,800
And so I passed the hours
thinking and thinking

164
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,960
until there was nothing
that hadn't received

165
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,603
the sharp cut of my axe.

166
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,280
With the blade of my machete,
it would have been easy

167
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,493
to slice away even a thought.

168
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,053
She never said anything.

169
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,893
But I felt her silent pain.

170
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,160
It made her suffer and was always there

171
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,820
under the shadow of her tearful eyes,

172
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,190
like the drops that gather
on the leaves of the plants

173
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,603
after the storm has passed.

174
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,540
- Let's go to the
mountains to get flowers.

175
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,373
- We'll go tomorrow.

176
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:31,553
I have to finish the fence
for the chicken coop.

177
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,370
- Why haven't my parents
and my sister come to visit?

178
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,370
- They were here last week.

179
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,860
It's very difficult to get out here.

180
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,210
You have to row a lot.

181
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,773
- Your parents have never come.

182
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,700
- One of these days,
we'll go to the pueblo.

183
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,773
- One of these days.

184
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,014
- Are you happy?
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:06,473
The months
came and the months went.

186
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,873
And the joys arrived after the months.

187
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,880
And with them, the sorrows went away.

188
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,620
- The priest is going to come on Saturday

189
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,850
to marry the couples
who are living together.

190
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,650
You think you'd like to get married?

191
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,320
- What for?

192
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,290
There are plenty of pretty
pigeons here to my liking.

193
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,770
- After you took Mary
Elena, all the pigeons

194
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,330
13 and 14 years old began
flirting with you, Don Miguel.

195
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,960
- So I've noticed.

196
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,200
And a few of them are ready to be tasted.

197
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,670
- What about Mary Elena?

198
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,870
Have you seen her again?

199
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:57,283
Get out of here!

200
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:58,851
No, get out!

201
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,681
Let me go, please!

202
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:05,677
Let me go, please!

203
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,111
Please, leave me alone!

204
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,278
No, not again!

205
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,970
No, please let me go!

206
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:16,235
No, leave me alone!

207
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,518
Please leave me alone!

208
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,477
No, no!

209
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:22,541
Please let me go!

210
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,124
No, no, no, no, no!

211
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:26,518
Juanito!

212
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:29,495
No, no, please let me go!

213
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:34,658
Juanito!

214
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
- Hello there.

215
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,053
How are things with my pretty pigeon?

216
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:16,160
You whore, you're!

217
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,993
- No!

218
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:21,768
- It's plain to see he's
the father of your child!

219
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:33,195
Mary Elena!

220
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:41,738
Mary Elena!

221
00:21:43,221 --> 00:21:44,138
Mary Elena!

222
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:50,194
Mary Elena!

223
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:52,642
Mary Elena!

224
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:22,545
- Shut up!

225
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,020
Get in there!

226
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,780
Get going, you guys, now move along now.

227
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,300
Hurry up now!

228
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,360
Get moving!

229
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,630
Pick up your feet.

230
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,030
Come on.

231
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,560
Don't look at me like that.

232
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,030
Move along now.

233
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,043
In you go.

234
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,700
Come on, don't bunch up around the door.

235
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,670
Stay in line!

236
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,290
Let's keep some order in here.

237
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,670
Get ready for two more.

238
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,350
Now pay attention.
- Keep them moving in here!

239
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,645
Hurry up!

240
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:48,600
That's it.

241
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,433
That's it!

242
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,280
One coming in.

243
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,320
- Open the gate!
- Okay, let's go.

244
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,300
Line up, line up.

245
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,263
- Come on, handsome move your ass!

246
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:00,521
Come on, let's get outta here!

247
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:01,386
What happened?

248
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:02,219
Stay where you are!

249
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,285
Stay put or we're blow your heads off!

250
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:07,067
Now, nobody move!

251
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:08,859
- Man, he's no good, get out!

252
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,093
- What's your name?

253
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:36,466
- Open up!

254
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,020
- Who's the bastard that keeps on crying?

255
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,510
- My brother, Gerardo.

256
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,763
He's about to die.

257
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,620
- Shut your face and let
the kid die in peace!

258
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,620
- Hey, Juan.

259
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,530
Divide up your brother's
clothes for all of us.

260
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,710
- If he can't live much
longer, what's he eating for?

261
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,543
- Hey, you pig.

262
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:11,827
Give me some food too.

263
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:51,259
- My brother has passed away.

264
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,150
My brother has passed away!

265
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,380
My brother Gerardo is dead!

266
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,623
- He's ice cold.

267
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,360
- Why don't we try to keep it a secret

268
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,450
for about three or four
days, because they'll

269
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,650
still give us his meals.

270
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,440
- The stench would be unbearable.

271
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,600
- Oh, how delicate you are.

272
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,410
the smell of the latrine is worse.

273
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,480
- Guards!

274
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,330
Guards!

275
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,010
There's a dead man in here!

276
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,081
- Shut your-
- Quiet down!

277
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,061
- I'll call a squad of undertakers.

278
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:52,894
Open up.

279
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,361
There, in the corner.

280
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:29,822
Take him away!

281
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:35,124
- Let go of him, let go of him!

282
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,520
- They've got another one
to amuse themselves with.

283
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,930
- Yeah.

284
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,280
They might show respect,
at least for the dead.

285
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,373
- They touch my brother, they'll be dead.

286
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:58,747
You look like
a beautiful young girl.

287
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:35,160
- Water!

288
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,200
- You'll pass around the
water and nothing more.

289
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,033
Come on.

290
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:41,866
Get going.

291
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,963
- Just look at that poor old man.

292
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,240
That's the worst torture of all.

293
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,380
- Benacio punished him because he tried

294
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,840
to kill his cellmate
who wanted to screw him

295
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
while he was asleep.

296
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,260
And now he passes out the
water without drinking himself.

297
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,109
- Move along, move along!
- Pick up the pace, men.

298
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:49,026
Pick it up.

299
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,705
Come on!

300
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:18,705
Keep moving!

301
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,982
Get the lead out, hurry up!

302
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,727
Move along.

303
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,063
Come on!

304
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:41,222
Get up!

305
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,653
- I hope your pelican doesn't sink.

306
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,343
- I've dissected everything.

307
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,023
Even dogs.

308
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,960
And this isn't gonna be
the start of my bad luck.

309
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,773
- It'll work, don't you worry.

310
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,320
At five o'clock we'll be finished.

311
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,973
Nothing will happen.

312
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,810
Every one's forbidden
to mistreat those birds

313
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,768
by orders of the commandant.

314
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,410
- Come on, you filthy scum.

315
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,780
We're behind schedule.

316
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,613
Get moving.

317
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:46,623
- I am Nica Noah.

318
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:49,160
- Oh yes, I know.

319
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,370
I promised one afternoon
last week to help you.

320
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,870
What do you want?

321
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,603
- A bird vendor is
planning to escape today.

322
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:24,040
- Now the tide will
come in and we'll leave.

323
00:35:36,812 --> 00:35:39,090
- Very good work, Captain.

324
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:39,940
- Thank you, sir.

325
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,675
- You've got to hurry, before
it's time for roll call.

326
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,810
- You idiot, don't you know it's forbidden

327
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,297
to hurt the pelicans?

328
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,060
- We've done enough for today, children.

329
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,153
Return to the prison.

330
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:44,780
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

331
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,160
- Can't you men hear?
- Come on!

332
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,630
Line up!

333
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,720
Hurry up, let's go.

334
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,340
Come on!
- Straighten up now.

335
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,173
- Hurry up.

336
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:52,356
Get in line.

337
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,189
Come on now.

338
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:54,022
Get in line.

339
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:54,990
No.

340
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,823
Hurry up.

341
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:57,742
There to the right, let's go.

342
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,370
- 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24.

343
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,280
Berno, in that section
there's one missing.

344
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
- No one is missing.

345
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,580
- Colonel.
- No, one's missing.

346
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,413
Get moving.

347
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,258
- Right face, right face.

348
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,393
- Come on, get the lead out there.

349
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,383
- He's driving us all crazy again.

350
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,763
Shut up, you son of a bitch!

351
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,730
- Lend me your guitar, huh fella?

352
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,950
- You don't lend someone a guitar, friend.

353
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,583
You might lend a woman,
but never a guitar.

354
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,210
- And just how much do you
think your instrument's worth?

355
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,043
- A hundred.

356
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,503
- Get up!

357
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,970
What's the matter?

358
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,260
- The same as ever, sir.

359
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,360
A wound from the iron.

360
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,153
Take him to the
to be cured.

361
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,310
You two over there, come here.

362
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,143
Help him.

363
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,777
Escort, give us a hand.

364
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:49,643
- Let's go!

365
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:06,217
Here comes
another one for you, big boy.

366
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,193
- Your leg's full of gangrene.

367
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,143
- Take it easy, honey.

368
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,670
- Have to cut it off.

369
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,503
- Cut?

370
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:27,336
Cut it?

371
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:28,440
Cut it my ass!

372
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,920
You won't cut it off!

373
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,088
Let me go, you sons of bitches!

374
00:43:34,088 --> 00:43:37,776
No, you damn coward bastards!

375
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,173
No!

376
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,147
Please don't cut off my
leg, for the love of heaven!

377
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:07,173
- For half a pound of
tobacco, you can have him.

378
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,637
If you want to try him out, Mama Juanito

379
00:45:15,637 --> 00:45:17,073
will sell him to you.

380
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:41,799
- What were you talking about
this afternoon with Raul?

381
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:43,993
- About my brother.

382
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,040
The chief undertaker composed
and signed his death warrant.

383
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,117
- Come on, get to work!

384
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:20,249
- Hey you, pick him up.

385
00:46:58,138 --> 00:46:59,290
- Nobody shoot him!

386
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,950
- The first lousy son of a bitch

387
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,343
that takes a step toward me, I'll kill!

388
00:47:03,343 --> 00:47:04,593
- Hold your fire.

389
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,127
- Stay where you are!
- Don't come any closer!

390
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,053
- Hear me out, son.

391
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,290
If you don't still surrender,
those bloodthirsty guards

392
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,723
will surely tear you apart.

393
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,083
I beg you, son, give me
the iron bar right now.

394
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,250
I promise by my military word of honor

395
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,763
that no one will harm you.

396
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,600
Stand back!

397
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,010
I gave my word and it will be kept!

398
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,043
Take him away without hurting him!

399
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,463
- Halt!

400
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,050
Open the ranks!

401
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,027
Soldiers face front!

402
00:48:02,027 --> 00:48:02,944
Face front!

403
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:26,987
- As you see, I gave my
word, but the discipline

404
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,603
of the prison must be kept
no matter what the cost.

405
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:34,287
Let go of me, you damn fool, let go of me!

406
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:39,016
Keep still!

407
00:48:40,435 --> 00:48:41,875
As you were!

408
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:42,708
Follow me!

409
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:53,983
- Dearest nephew.

410
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,403
- My nephew.

411
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,853
- I have never asked you for anything.

412
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,240
- I...

413
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,353
- Have never asked you for anything.

414
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,400
- Never...

415
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,460
- I have never asked you for anything.

416
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,293
- Anything,

417
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:23,930
- But it's that now I need it very much.

418
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,850
- In another week, I'll be out free.

419
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,620
The stupid judge acquitted me.

420
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,003
- What will your wife say?

421
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,440
- What do I care?

422
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,520
The bitch took another
man three years ago.

423
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,993
Now the judge says I'm innocent.

424
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:03,930
- Wait a minute.

425
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,810
You write it however you like.

426
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:07,910
The main thing is that he sends the money.

427
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,633
- And what do you want the money for?

428
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,443
I want to buy the guitar
from the negro smith.

429
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,670
- I've heard that it's really marvelous

430
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,560
to witness the way that these
men live in this prison.

431
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,580
- You're very lucky because until now,

432
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,409
no woman has ever entered this prison.

433
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:35,075
- What an honor.

434
00:51:23,037 --> 00:51:24,470
- Why are they beaten like that?

435
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:26,570
- They aren't really beaten.

436
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,390
They are often able to break the rivet

437
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,490
they have on their feet or their wrists

438
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,550
that closes the irons.

439
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,320
They find many ingenious ways to do it.

440
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,470
Sometimes they fasten
their arms with a new clasp

441
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,880
that they make out of a piece of metal,

442
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,643
like a tin plate or a big nail.

443
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,790
And that's what the guard is doing.

444
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:48,100
Making sure that the irons sound the same.

445
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,013
It's a way to prevent escapes.

446
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,570
- What is that, Colonel?

447
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,050
- The inmates also have an orchestra,

448
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,560
something that proves the
cheerfulness of their lives here.

449
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,210
They sing and dance happily in prison.

450
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,203
Captain, bring the orchestra.

451
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,173
- Yes Colonel.

452
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,753
- All the orchestra, outside.

453
00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:53,040
- Where are you going?

454
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,370
That piece of junk guitar
was playing in the band.

455
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,273
Outside.

456
00:52:57,830 --> 00:52:58,663
Come on!

457
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,987
Not you, bagged queens.

458
00:54:07,394 --> 00:54:08,536
- Stupid fools!

459
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,600
Don't you know how to play anything else?

460
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,900
- Leave them alone!

461
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,450
I'm gonna dance for them.

462
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,320
- Then get down on your knees,

463
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,263
because you don't deserve
that a woman dances for you.

464
00:54:18,263 --> 00:54:19,930
Bend your knee down!

465
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:20,457
Quiet down.

466
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,770
- Just six months ago, this
letter arrived for you.

467
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:40,603
Take it.

468
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,053
- Here are the a hundred
pesos you asked for.

469
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,750
Now give me the guitar.

470
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,170
- I'll tell you the real truth.

471
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,460
I was only joking.

472
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,280
I love it more than my life.

473
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,270
- No, you weren't joking.

474
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,343
You told me a hundred
pesos and here they are.

475
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,973
- Keep your word to him.

476
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,330
- All right, I'll keep my word, as I said.

477
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,640
You want a handkerchief too?

478
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,320
- No, you keep the
handkerchief for yourself.

479
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,153
Thank you.

480
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:34,283
Finally I'll be able to live in peace.

481
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,833
You instrument of the devil.

482
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,373
- The letter.

483
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,640
It's been years since I've
had the honor of seeing you,

484
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,190
Colonel Vargas.

485
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,063
- So it has.

486
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,090
Not since the times in military school

487
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,900
in the Republic of Chile.

488
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:45,733
- Whiskey, Colonel?

489
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:47,250
- No thank you.

490
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,850
The president has sent you this.

491
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,293
- I can't believe this.

492
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,250
That bastard of a president
of plainly accuses me

493
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,090
of beatings and killings of the prisoners.

494
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:21,380
- It's that the family of Jose Barientos

495
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,530
heard that he died of a beating
and was thrown in the sea.

496
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,810
And since they're
friends of the president-

497
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,370
- No one is assassinated here!

498
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,770
As for Jose Barientos, he was
killed while trying to escape,

499
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:34,440
and I have it recorded in the book!

500
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,353
He and all the others
who suffer the same fate.

501
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,800
- Accident and or not,
the truth is I was given

502
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,470
the task of notifying you
that the General President

503
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:46,010
of the Republic as ordered me to take

504
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:48,270
immediate command of the island,

505
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,670
and that you're to present
yourself at headquarters

506
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,950
tomorrow morning.

507
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:54,550
- Tell that old asshole of your general

508
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,390
that on this island, I'm in command!

509
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,960
- Gentlemen.

510
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,400
Please.

511
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,410
- You'll be sorry for this.

512
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:01,810
I swear you're crazy, Benancio!

513
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,020
- Your mother will be the sorry one

514
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,300
to have borne you if you return here!

515
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,890
Tell this to the president,
that as of today,

516
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,123
this island is a free republic!

517
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,173
- The colonel.
- About face!

518
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,433
Present arms!

519
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,270
- I speak to all of you, my beloved sons,

520
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:43,010
to bring the good tidings
today to one and all

521
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:47,343
that I, Benancio Salvatiera Lopez,

522
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,263
colonel of the first
regiment of the cavalry,

523
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,943
commandant of the
penitentiary of this island,

524
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,770
I say this before some brainless idiot

525
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,510
starts to imagine that I'm in the military

526
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,410
for the fun of it.

527
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:12,150
At this moment, with the
help of the good lord,

528
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:15,570
and the almighty the
inspiration of my conscience,

529
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:19,570
I declare freedom,
sovereignty, and independence

530
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:21,760
for this island...

531
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,313
And I proclaim it a free republic!

532
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:33,570
I named myself president,
warning that if anyone

533
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,443
disagrees with this nomination,

534
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,300
that means you, the jackals of the guard,

535
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,680
executioners of the slaughterhouse,

536
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,433
slaves to the uniform.

537
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:53,223
The same goes for you, my beloved sons,

538
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,860
the swindlers and
assassins, rapists, maniacs,

539
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:02,113
sodomites, thieves,
criminals, degenerates,

540
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,010
locked in here by order of a
government of despotic tyranny.

541
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,960
Speak up now, because
I'll hold court martial

542
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,240
for him for treason against
the new-formed state

543
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,793
to be shot at once!

544
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:32,150
And now, through the
faculty of my new powers

545
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:34,203
as your president of the republic,

546
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:40,193
from this moment on, I forbid
any form whatever of slavery.

547
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,600
The penitenture of this
island is now dead!

548
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,133
Long live the republic!

549
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,320
I declare all of you the founders

550
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,920
of the newly-formed republic,
and I accept with great joy

551
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,413
the offer you have made me to
be the very first president.

552
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,910
I wish to repeat...

553
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:07,173
That if anyone does not agree with this,

554
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:11,230
they should make it known at
once and be sent to be shot!

555
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,503
All the prisoners are now free men.

556
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,990
But any one citizen who wishes to abandon

557
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,450
this island without
permission from the council

558
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:34,703
of the general's staff will be shot!

559
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,373
Now repeat after me.

560
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:42,262
Viva la republica!

561
01:05:42,262 --> 01:05:43,953
Viva!

562
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:44,786
- Viva me!

563
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,753
Long live me!

564
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:49,140
- No, you idiots!

565
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,498
Viva General Benancio!

566
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:54,310
Viva General Benancio!

567
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:55,173
- General.

568
01:05:56,690 --> 01:05:57,773
That's not bad.

569
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:01,563
That gives me the same
rank as a stupid president.

570
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,290
And because the title expresses
the wishes of the people,

571
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,483
I accept.

572
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:18,883
- Come out.

573
01:06:18,883 --> 01:06:20,563
You're free by orders of General Benancio.

574
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,573
- I got so accustomed to this
damn thing, I'm gonna miss it.

575
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:34,253
It's the same for all of us.

576
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:44,770
- Who's the officer who knows
about boats and sailing?

577
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,513
I name you minister of the Navy.

578
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,887
You'll answer to me with your life

579
01:06:48,887 --> 01:06:50,730
for the five boats that we possess.

580
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:51,780
- Yes, Mr. President.

581
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:55,183
- Lieutenant.

582
01:06:57,270 --> 01:07:00,140
I name you minister of defense.

583
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,530
Train the prisoners, but don't issue arms.

584
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:03,623
- Yes, Mr. President.

585
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:09,710
- One of the prisoners was
formerly a school teacher.

586
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:11,260
I've been thinking about naming him

587
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,493
minister of education and foreign affairs.

588
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,200
Locate him.

589
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,920
His name is Nicano.

590
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,700
As of this moment, you will
occupy the honored post

591
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,760
of minister of education
and foreign affairs

592
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,740
of our independent republic.

593
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,490
See that he has the proper clothes.

594
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:35,627
- Come on.

595
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,600
- Colonel Benancio has
gone off his rocker,

596
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,690
and it's imperative we take him prisoner.

597
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,520
- He has all the inmates on his side.

598
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,370
They don't count.

599
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:58,970
Even if that were so, we've sworn

600
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,610
our loyalty to the president.

601
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,460
We'll arrest him.

602
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,053
Have your arms ready.

603
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,439
If it's necessary, we'll have to kill him,

604
01:08:08,439 --> 01:08:10,520
and all those who are with him.

605
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,670
- Stay where you are
or I'll have you shot.

606
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,600
I accuse you of insubordination
and planning a rebellion

607
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,410
in a state of war.

608
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:22,033
You will be shot as
traitors whenever I please.

609
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,004
Take them to the guard
house and lock them up.

610
01:10:46,862 --> 01:10:47,695
- No!

611
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,283
- For spying.

612
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:24,140
Sneaking, informing, and betraying,

613
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,173
and loyalty to the new government,
I appointed you captain.

614
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,360
Your very first mission will
be to design and manufacture

615
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,940
medals to be used for decorating you

616
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,930
and all the brave soldiers in our forces

617
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,133
before every battle.

618
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:15,010
- The worst possible thing they could do

619
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:18,980
Was to take off the chains
and give us hope again.

620
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:20,370
- What's the use of our being free

621
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,573
if we're all poisoned and bitter inside?

622
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:26,200
- It's nearly 15 years now
that I haven't seen my sons.

623
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,010
- You have ample pause to bring about

624
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:53,540
the signing of a treaty
with the president.

625
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,220
In no moment must you show weakness,

626
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:57,670
and remember that a great army

627
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:00,110
on the brink of war is behind you.

628
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:03,293
The destiny of the fatherland
lies in your hands.

629
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,223
I propose a toast to the new republic.

630
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:44,030
Because I have never enjoyed
doing anything halfway, I...

631
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:49,830
Benancio Salvatyra
Lopez, elected president

632
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,773
by the freewill of all the people,

633
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:55,680
after much deep thinking
and studying conscientiously

634
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,193
the problem, have arrived
at the following conclusion.

635
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:03,733
It is necessary for us to
have our very own flag.

636
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,350
And who knows...

637
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,060
Even our own anthem.

638
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,543
- That crazy man is capable of turning

639
01:15:41,543 --> 01:15:44,793
the prisoners against us to destroy us.

640
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,140
- Are you quite comfortable,
your excellency?

641
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,670
Minister of education and foreign affairs

642
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:06,880
of the independent republic,
you'll have to forgive me

643
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,890
and understand that matters of state

644
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,470
have kept me from receiving
you at the palace.

645
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:14,100
I was told that General
Benancio has sent you here

646
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,520
to tell me something about the revolution,

647
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,620
and you will see for
yourself what will happen

648
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,050
to that criminal.

649
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,853
I've already sent him my answer.

650
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,470
- I was sent here to report to you, sir,

651
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:28,870
about the reception of
beatings that awaited us,

652
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,090
and that he was going
to request permission

653
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:34,840
of Congress, because he wanted the honor

654
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,153
of coming to visit you.

655
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:38,863
- Was he serious?

656
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,933
Bring the cannon!

657
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,823
And put it over there!

658
01:16:45,823 --> 01:16:47,599
And point it out that way!

659
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,580
Aim across the starboard bow.

660
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:48,270
- Turn it around.

661
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,528
Help me.

662
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:58,960
- It says 1000 meters.

663
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,460
- Then verify it to the right.

664
01:18:07,684 --> 01:18:09,307
Fire!

665
01:18:09,307 --> 01:18:11,482
- Fire.

666
01:18:16,146 --> 01:18:17,770
- Fire!

667
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:26,940
Cease firing.

668
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:27,890
- Come on!

669
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:29,599
Forward, everyone!

670
01:18:29,599 --> 01:18:30,766
Get a move on!

671
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:32,640
Forward!

672
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,260
- Lower the boat!

673
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,593
Come on, move in over there!

674
01:18:56,957 --> 01:18:59,504
What are you waiting for?!

675
01:18:59,504 --> 01:19:01,277
Here we are!

676
01:19:01,277 --> 01:19:02,444
Disembark now!

677
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:34,640
Well, it looks like they surrendered.

678
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:35,983
Stupid cowards.

679
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:39,350
- This is our best chance.

680
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,000
The first thing that
Captain Astrua will do

681
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,280
when he gets out of prison is
put all of us in chains again.

682
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,524
- Yeah, Juanito, whatever you say.

683
01:19:47,524 --> 01:19:48,670
On the other side of those mountains,

684
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:51,193
life is beautiful, and it's free.

685
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,050
- By direct order of your president,

686
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:09,933
no one is to pay any more
attention to Colonel Benancio,

687
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,930
and you are advised that if in 20 minutes

688
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:16,470
you don't surrender, all the prisoners

689
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:20,083
as well as the soldiers will
be blown to bits by the cannon.

690
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,410
For every one of you, our good president

691
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:28,943
has given his solemn oath
to forgive and pardon you.

692
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,360
Therefore, I ask for you
to put down your arms.

693
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:51,079
- Stop there, men!

694
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:58,340
Set fire to this whole side.

695
01:21:58,340 --> 01:21:59,190
- You heard him.

696
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,023
Come on.

697
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:22,213
- Like snakes, let them burn.

698
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,320
- The fire will save us.

699
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,380
They won't be able to reach us.

700
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,880
- The wind's blowing this way.

701
01:22:40,371 --> 01:22:41,475
- Captain!

702
01:22:41,475 --> 01:22:42,642
There they go!

703
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:00,500
- The wind's beginning to blow hard.

704
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,230
We couldn't reach them even in the boat.

705
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:05,580
Tomorrow they'll be on one
of those little islands.

706
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:08,163
- If the sharks don't
decide to eat them tonight.

707
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:11,250
- Don't swim anymore.

708
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,830
Let the current pull you along.

709
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:14,130
- Where'll the current take us?

710
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,030
We'll come to the island of
, I would guess.

711
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,113
It's all over, Juanito, it's all over.

712
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:23,800
The life of the damned
that we were leading

713
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,620
will never be again.

714
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,630
- Never.

715
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:27,963
It'll never be again.

716
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:30,690
It's over.

717
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:31,853
It's all over now

718
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,510
- Two desperate men have
just escaped from the prison.

719
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:47,420
They're accused of committing many crimes.

720
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,573
They are very dangerous, and
capable of murdering anyone.

721
01:24:55,548 --> 01:24:58,780
- The commander of the harbor patrol

722
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:03,780
hereby warns the public
against two escaped convicts.

723
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:06,410
For their capture dead or alive,

724
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:09,100
we offered the following reward.

725
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:12,800
Two pounds of rice,
three pounds of potatoes,

726
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,793
two pounds of coffee,
three pounds of sugar,

727
01:25:17,314 --> 01:25:22,223
two pounds of cocoa powder,
one can of sardines,

728
01:25:23,074 --> 01:25:28,074
10 packs of cigarettes,
one dozen boxes of matches,

729
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:31,831
and three silver pesos in cash.

730
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,480
- Keep going.

731
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,840
A bit farther and we'll be on the beach.

732
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,298
- Look, a shark.

733
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:36,470
- I see them.

734
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,580
Keep on swimming without missing a stroke.

735
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,970
Same rhythm.

736
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:42,111
Don't splash the water, we
mustn't attract their attention.

737
01:28:31,684 --> 01:28:32,684
- Christian.

738
01:28:34,841 --> 01:28:35,674
Juanito.

739
01:28:38,744 --> 01:28:42,243
For three days now they
haven't brought any water.

740
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:46,543
Since you both escaped.

741
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:54,820
Since you both escaped,
haven't brought any water.

742
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,940
- How did you learn about our escape?

743
01:28:57,940 --> 01:29:02,940
I heard the cannon yesterday,
the patrolled passed by.

744
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:08,380
But they didn't leave me any water or food

745
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:12,233
because they said you could
come and take it away from me.

746
01:29:14,539 --> 01:29:16,623
Take it away from me.

747
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,561
I know I'm gonna die.

748
01:29:20,561 --> 01:29:23,850
I'm gonna die.

749
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:27,798
I'm going to die.

750
01:29:28,716 --> 01:29:29,883
I'm gonna die.

751
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,060
- Take hold of his leg.

752
01:30:31,702 --> 01:30:33,153
I'm too weak to swim.

753
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,900
- It's better that you die in the sea.

754
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:39,440
And not here.

755
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:41,363
- This man was sentenced to be killed.

756
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:44,780
- I might at least have
some hope in the ocean.

757
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:49,523
If I remain here, there's
absolutely no hope for me.

758
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:56,123
- The problem is that the
blood will attract the sharks.

759
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:58,790
- It'll be better that way.

760
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:00,150
- We have some rotten shark meat with us

761
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:02,230
which usually keeps them away.

762
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:04,630
The waves were so strong
that we lost all of it.

763
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,680
- I'm going to put this marker here.

764
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,910
When the sun gets to it,
start swimming south,

765
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:18,410
and by then we should be able to reach

766
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:19,743
that island over there.

767
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:10,893
- Take him out.

768
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:16,270
On second thought, leave him where he is

769
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:17,970
so the sharks can finish with him.

770
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,760
Dead men don't interest me anyway.

771
01:32:21,950 --> 01:32:23,873
It's a finish worthy of the bastards.

772
01:32:57,830 --> 01:33:01,210
Two pounds of
rice, three pounds of potatoes,

773
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,390
two pounds of coffee,
three pounds of sugar,

774
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:08,580
two pounds of cocoa powder,
one can of sardines,

775
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:13,580
10 packs of cigarettes,
one dozen boxes of matches,

776
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:16,203
and three silver pesos in cash.

777
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:19,727
That's what life was worth for a convict

778
01:33:21,246 --> 01:33:24,258
on the island of lonely men.
