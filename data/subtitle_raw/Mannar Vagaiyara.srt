3
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,640
Greetings brother!

4
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,040
Rajangam,you had given a bound book
instead of a invitation.

5
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,160
Yes brother,

6
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
If any of the relatives name goes
missing they'll be insane.

7
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
So printed out all the names.

8
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,480
Okay,good!

9
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,440
Be seated brother.

10
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,680
(Chanting Mantras)

11
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,800
Greetings!

12
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,800
Welcome Uncle!

13
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,320
After a span of 27 years,
all the relationships are conjoined today.

14
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,480
I feel so happy.

15
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,360
Uncle,you are the reason
 behind this marriage.

16
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,280
If my brother comes now,
that's enough for me!

17
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,920
I too wish the same,Uncle.

18
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,840
It must be the same as our marriage.

19
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,360
When everyone has come
for his son's marriage,

20
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,440
Won't he come?

21
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:09,880
Right.

22
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,360
He'll come.

23
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
Be happy.

24
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,760
Aunt,

25
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,240
Yes.

26
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,800
Shall we sort out the gifts to be given?

27
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,280
Yes...

28
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Be seated,Uncle.

29
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Call the elder son.

31
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,960
Ask him when he comes?

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Okay.

33
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
Come.

34
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,360
Tell me dad.

35
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,200
Have you started?

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Everyone is asking about you.

37
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,160
Is it dad?

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll start in ten minutes.

39
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,240
Hey...

40
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
Hey...

41
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,680
Hey,who are you?

42
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
Concealed your face like a woman.

43
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,080
Mathi!

44
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,560
Tell me.

45
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
Dude,

46
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,640
Abducted?

47
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,000
What do you say?

48
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,600
Who is that?

49
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
Mathialagan,son of
Govindharaj Mudaliar,Kanthangudi.

50
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:55,840
Is it Mathi?

51
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,840
He has thrashed all our guys.

52
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,080
I'll kill him and get my sister.

53
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,760
Take the vehicle.

54
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,840
A few months before...

55
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,680
Dear ladies and gentlemen,

56
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,000
Hmm...

57
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,120
The commander of the King's generation,

58
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Hmm...

59
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
Mathialagan Mooriyar,

60
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,840
written his law exams
and coming forth successfully.

61
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,160
Sir,paper sir.

62
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,440
Paper sir.

63
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,600
Sir,where are you?

64
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,440
Come on...

65
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,840
Come on...

66
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,080
Brother did the exams amazing!

67
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,400
Answer sheets was not sufficient.

68
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,480
When others get answer sheets,
he was getting more number of pens.

69
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,680
He is doing wonders!

70
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,600
It doesn't seem that brother
writes exam to be a lawyer,

71
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,720
It's like as a judge,
he writes a judgement to the society.

72
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,600
Call the oldsters.

73
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,000
Play the music.

74
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,160
"A ballad needs mount of words,"

75
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:31,440
"You are so forth generation

76
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,280
"We hang around singing lullaby,"

77
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:54,400
"But came to tune an onset ballad to you,"

78
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,440
Sing! Sing now!

79
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
"Come on! Come on!"

80
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,400
"A lawyer has come to bail us out,"

81
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,480
"We can do any erratum,"

82
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,560
"Come on! Come on!"

83
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
"The prison is our school,"

84
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,960
"We can manage with our dude,"

85
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,880
"We can drive without licence,"

86
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,960
"Upsurge the sound of  silencer,"

87
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,640
"Stand bold even if the poilce comes near,"

88
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,080
"State the name of our kin,"

89
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
"A bout for bout,"

90
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,160
"A ballad for a ballad,"

91
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,320
"Tie the swaddling clout"

92
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:55,760
"We're the so forth generation
of the King's!"

93
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
Dude,look at there.

94
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
Tamarind sack dances wearing your brief.

95
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,560
If you ask me,
I would've bought you trousers.

96
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,280
Slashed...

97
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,320
"What may happen to the law,
If you are not there?"

98
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,400
"It becomes a temple without deity,"

99
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,480
"If I wear a vest or tonsure my head,

100
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,520
I won't do without your consent."

101
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,800
"Though you do blunders,that's right."

102
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
"As granny told,the crow looks white."

103
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,800
"We'll pounce if anyone question us,"

104
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,720
"We'll act in home as if we are good,"

105
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,960
"We'll be the saviours of our hamlet,"

106
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,280
"We'll offer to whoever is in need!"

107
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:57,480
"We're the so forth generation of the King's!"

108
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Hmm...

109
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,680
Bro,

110
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,200
Just a single BGM,
we'll adjust.

111
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,760
Hmm.

112
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,600
Okay!

113
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Okay!

114
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,840
"A locus theatre,a locus sweet of honey,"

115
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,760
"Shall we taste together!"

116
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
"We're as pure as gold!

117
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,880
"Roaring lions!"

118
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,960
"Don't seduce us,go away."

"It's a bare land to play,"

120
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,120
"Cuddle and play,"

121
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,200
"Don't butch the goat before..."

122
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,040
"You spoil the chore and trying to rush away, "

123
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,320
"I accept that you are honest,"

124
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,560
"erstwhile a couple of vessels were burgled"

125
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,480
I do accept,

126
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,240
I do accept that your mother is a naive.

127
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,960
Meet you next time.

128
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,560
Greetings!

129
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,320
Thank you!

130
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,200
Brother!

131
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,640
Yes brother!

132
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,760
We'll complete the final BGM and go to home.

133
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:27,440
"We're the so forth generation
of the King's!"

134
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,760
He gets caught.

135
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,960
Dad!

136
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,520
What's all this?

137
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,240
To whom is the reception?

138
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,160
Who has come?

139
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,360
It's me!

140
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,640
Where did you go,
to come back?

141
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,400
To write the exams.

142
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,080
Oh!

143
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,320
Hey,when did you come?

144
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:55,920
When do you left?

145
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,720
How are you?

146
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,680
You have come soon.

147
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,560
Question paper was so easy.

148
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,400
Is it to lift?

149
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,760
To write...

150
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,640
You are talking to dad with coolers,

151
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,560
Don't you know the respect?

152
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,400
Take it.

153
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
It's okay, who were all these guys?

154
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
Are they your classmates?

155
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,960
They are the drummers.

156
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,200
Oops!

157
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,800
What does he say?

158
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,240
They are asking for money.

159
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,680
Just wait.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
Isn't it waste of money?

161
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
When my younger is at fault,

162
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,040
it's my duty as a elder
to take care of him.

163
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,000
I expected this goof,
I have money with me.

164
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,800
I'll give dad.

165
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,600
Hey... hey...

166
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,520
What's the stuff now?

167
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,120
Happiness!

168
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,560
Hey...hey...

169
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,360
Hmm...

170
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
No sound must emanate
till you cross the street.

171
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,280
Go away.

172
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,000
Tell them to go.

173
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,560
Go away.

174
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,720
Hey,don't you have respect?

175
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,520
Hey,do you act as if good?

176
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,000
Hey...hey...

177
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,280
What happened now?

178
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,320
They crossed the street!

179
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,480
What?

180
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,240
Don't know why they vigourously
 beat the drums today?

181
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,480
You completed the studies,
so what's up next?

182
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,200
Hmm,
Hmm.

183
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:09,920
Mathi!

184
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,360
Hey!

185
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,200
Oh!

186
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
What happened?

187
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,840
Why do you cry?

188
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,240
Mathi,why do you cry?

189
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,840
Tell us the reason.

190
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,680
Unless I know the reason,
I won't allow you to take food.

191
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,480
Be quite,Arivu.

192
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,400
Tell now.

193
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
I'm going to be a lawyer.

194
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,960
Everyone in our house
has done a degree course.

195
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,880
Born into this family,

196
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,840
he failed tenth grade and
not ashamed to dine.

197
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,160
Tears roll on when I
think of him,dad.

198
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Does tears roll on?

199
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
What to do?

200
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,360
He is not able to study.

201
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,760
For that?

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,920
Shall we leave him free?

203
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,000
When younger brother
scored poor in studies,

204
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,560
Uncle punished him
and made him to study better.

205
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,240
Conjoined,leave this to me.

206
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,400
I'll pounce his moss and mocker
and make him to get a degree soon.

207
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Is it a must to study in such a way?

208
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,040
What's that you ask?

209
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
Do you know why god
grant us a pair of eyes?

210
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:02,880
For what?

211
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,080
One is to perceive,
 and the other one is to read.

212
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,480
Oh...

213
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,600
Listen to him.

214
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,720
When listening to him,
I desire to join a school now.

215
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,160
How does he eat
without any responsibility?

216
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,640
Hey...

217
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,240
Tamarind sack...

218
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,920
You don't worry.

219
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,440
I'll pounce and
push him to get a degree.

220
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,400
Hey,he won't thwart hunger,
How will he combat if you pounce?

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's good,that he must study.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,800
But handle him smooth.

223
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,440
Yes mom.

224
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,240
Mom!

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,640
Hey...hey...

226
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,280
Hey,where are you going?

227
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,040
He goes to buy books.

228
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,280
Where do you rush?
Wait, I'll come.

229
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,800
Where does he go?

230
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
He goes to buy a rope,
to tie him and pounce.

231
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,760
He made me not to eat.

232
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,120
Sir,
-What does he say?

233
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,400
why did you do this?

234
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,560
What I did?

235
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,680
What I did?

236
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,480
As you look fair,
 I expected you are educated.

237
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,200
Huh!

238
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,400
I'll tear you.

239
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,000
Everyone is pestering at me.

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,240
Go away.

241
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,760
Mom!

242
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,200
Yes.

243
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,440
Where is Uncle?

244
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,680
Mom,to receive me from college,

245
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,200
brother,friends
and even relatives has come.

246
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,360
Why didn't uncle come?

247
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,600
Tell me,why didn't he come?

248
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,640
You had written the law exams,

249
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
so afore you get the results,

250
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,640
In order to get the entire village
under his control

251
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,600
He left the house,

252
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,000
Where will he be now?

253
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,640
You must've seen "Actor Raghuvaran" as
slim,fair and a tall personality,

254
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,320
But you wouldn't have seen
 a fat, dark and short person...

255
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
What?

256
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,640
You must've seen "Raghuvaran" as
slim,fair and a tall personality,

257
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,400
Have you seen as a fat,
dark and short person?

258
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
What?

259
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,600
What's this?

260
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,480
Hey,old monster!

261
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,880
You must've seen "Raghuvaran" as
slim,fair and a tall personality.

262
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,840
Have you seen as a fat,
dark and short person?

263
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,120
What?

264
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,200
Hey,old monster!

265
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,120
Bro,ask her whether
she knows"Prakashraj"?

266
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,560
Wait,let me sort out "Raghuvaran",first.

267
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,080
You must've seen "Raghuvaran" as
slim,fair and a tall personality,

268
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,480
Have you seen as a fat,
dark and short person?

269
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,280
What?

270
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,840
Hey,what's this?

271
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
"Raghuvaran!"

272
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,880
He made Rajini to row
and Kamal to redheads.

273
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,400
Rohini's husband!

274
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,480
Born in Coimbatore...

275
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,800
What?

276
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,560
Atlast,she made
my introduction as "Raghuvaran's."

277
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
Yes,who are you?

278
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm standing so close,

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
but you dare to look at me
shortening the eyes,

280
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,160
I'll crumble you.

281
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,560
Aah!

282
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Hey,

283
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,760
Bro,

284
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,400
Get down.

285
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,720
Darling,I will come back.

286
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,840
Yes.

287
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Hey...

288
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,520
Look at there.

289
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,560
Hey,

290
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Who broiled with my mother?

291
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
It's an awry to leave her alive,

292
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,160
I just broiled with her.

293
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,960
Where are you,uncle?

294
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,440
Leave that.

295
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,640
How did you write the exams?

296
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,320
Uncle,really amazing!

297
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,280
A person in front of me is having
a long moustache,

298
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,760
what's the case for it?

299
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,400
A long moustache itself is a case.

300
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,040
See now,how I'm going to clench it?

301
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Oh no,uncle!

302
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,360
You dare to talk with this moustache.

303
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,520
If slothful,how the entire
zone will be under our control?

304
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,080
Go and do your best.

305
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,920
Tell me uncle..

306
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
We are not simple folks.

307
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,160
We are a big turf.

308
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,600
How did you write the exams?
-I told you I did well.

309
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,280
So, you will score centum.

310
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,800
Just a minute.

311
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,520
What did you comment?

312
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,360
We are not simple folks.

313
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,560
We are a big turf.

314
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,120
How do you become a turf
with only two persons?

315
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,840
Durai!
-Kattadurai!

316
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,520
Do you know with whom you breach?

317
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Do you know my history?

318
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,120
You too have a history?

319
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,320
Okay, I'll ask you a query
from your history.

320
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,120
What was cast by Rajarajan?

321
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,720
Nalini.

322
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,400
Hey,Ramarajan married her.

323
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,920
Is it?

324
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,520
You don't even know the difference between
Thanjavur Rajarajan and Madurai Ramarajan,

325
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,680
But you have a turf and a history behind it?

326
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,320
Come on...

327
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,920
Ashamed!

328
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,640
Hey,frog pest!

329
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,040
I am talking.

330
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,040
He dreams of his son-in-law becoming
a lawyer and can manage any problem.

331
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,560
Let the result comes.

332
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,800
Take the vehicle.

333
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
The vehicle he had taken is your's.

334
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,960
Did he taken away my vehicle?

335
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,040
He took not only the vehicle,
but your girlfriend too!

336
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,920
It's very good location!

337
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,000
We got the vehicle.

338
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,920
Dude,have you written the exams well?

339
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,960
Don't irritate me by repeatedly asking it.

340
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,360
Don't be angry.

341
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,520
I'll make you cool now.

342
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,800
I've got a new aunt for you.

343
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,400
He rocks!

344
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,440
Okay dude.

345
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,360
What's this ring tone?

346
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm actor Vijay's fan.

347
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,800
From now on,
you're fan of mine.

348
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,400
Come near.

349
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,760
He rocks!

350
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,840
Tell me,what's your name?

351
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
"Dhanalakshmi," sir.

352
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,200
What's your name?

353
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,920
"Elamurugan"

354
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,880
Didn't your parents accept you?

355
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,240
We belong to different caste,sir.

356
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,320
Not only that...

357
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,280
Tell me.

358
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,040
If my cousin,JP brother knows,
it'll emanate as a huge problem.

359
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,840
Which JP?

360
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,760
You mean, "JP Vaandaiyar"?

361
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Yes sir.

362
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,560
Who is that JP?

363
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,520
Sir,his name is
 "Jayaprakash Vaandaiyar."

364
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,160
He was elected twice unopposed,
 as the union chairman.

365
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,360
He will be in forefront if his
hamlet face any problems.

366
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,880
If any problem arise to him,

367
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,800
His entire hamlet stands behind him.

368
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,880
What's the name you mentioned?

369
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,200
"Jayaprakash Sethupathi Vaandaiyar."

370
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,560
Elamurugu,we will run away,

371
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Hello...

372
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,800
Wait sir.

373
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,640
Dare to fall in love?

374
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,560
Dare to fall in love?

375
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,440
How dare you love her?

376
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,760
Don't you know the cadre?

377
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,520
Will you intrude anywhere?

378
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,120
Get lost.

379
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Are you coming to police station?

380
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,880
Brother,please leave him.

381
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,520
Tell not to hit him.

382
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,680
Will you intrude in the name of love?

383
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,560
No brother.

384
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,880
How dare you do rowdism
in police station?

385
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,680
To be honest,we must hit you.

386
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,320
What?

387
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,720
Hey,stop it.

388
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,200
You has come here getting
a job from government.

389
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,280
Without knowing about
the status of the zone,

390
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,720
will you do marriage for them?

391
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
Then you give information
to the newspapers…

392
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,160
…and gives poise to the photos.

393
00:20:50,640 --> 00:21:00,280
We are the relatives for generations
to take care of all the goodwill.

394
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,320
Just do your work and get the salary.

395
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,840
Don't make me to come
again to police station.

396
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,120
Uncle,what's this fire?

397
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,680
I can't sleep in
this winter season,

398
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,320
So?

399
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
Gutted two huts by fire
and slept amidst of it,

400
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
A bit of fire brazed to shirt.

401
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,880
You are rocking,uncle!

402
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,920
Have you did
the exams well?

403
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,080
Amazing!

404
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,640
Then
what?

405
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,320
We'll gut two more tiled
houses by fire and sleep.

406
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,600
Dude,stop.
What?

407
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
Where are you going dressed up
as a bridegroom,competitive to me?

408
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,000
If I meet any bride on the way,
 i'll marry her.

409
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,360
Your plan is good.

410
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
Where did you
get this jeep?

411
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:53,800
It's stolen...

412
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,720
Captured as per law.

413
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,160
Sit down.

414
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,200
You stand like
electric poles.

415
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,920
I must take it
in reverse.

416
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
Look at the back.

417
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,840
Bro,
do you know to drive?

418
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,760
I'll tear you.

419
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,960
Dude,
look at the flex board.

420
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,120
You are "Bahubali."

421
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,960
I pity on "Rajamouli."

422
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Uncle,
why did you change the ring tone?

423
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,480
I changed the ring tone on the day
you completed the law exam.

424
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,280
I have even changed your aunt's name!

425
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,880
As what?

426
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Elder aunt's name as Ka'law'

427
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Younger aunt's name as Ma'law',

428
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,560
In between is Lai'law'.

429
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,160
Now the"law" gets completed.

430
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
Have a look at the frog pest!

431
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,680
You are our doyen!

432
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,160
If anyone opposes you,
they will be slayed.

433
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,360
Doyen!

434
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,240
Turn now.
Turn now.

435
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,760
I'll tear you

436
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,200
Hey frog pest,

437
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes.

438
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,120
Does he deserve
a flex board?

439
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes.

440
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,600
Athivetti Ajith,

441
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,440
Veerakurichi Vijay,

442
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,360
Soorapallam Suriya,

443
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,960
Is he the unified of all?

444
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes.

445
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,800
Why do you keep
flex board for him?

446
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,840
Why not for our bro?

447
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,720
No...
you mustn't.

448
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,240
Why?

449
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,760
Hey,
he is idle in house.

450
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,160
Every day at dawn and dusk

451
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,840
he can stand out
and state for a couple of hours.

452
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,160
Does he need
a flex board?

453
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,080
Welcome...
Welcome...

454
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,640
We have already come.

455
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,680
Do you like to have any drinks?

456
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,520
Give us liquor,

457
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,960
we can sit along with
musicians and drink it.

458
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,720
If the bride and groom is interested,
can join them too.

459
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,920
What the hell
do you ask us?

460
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Hey,
come aside

461
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,880
Get lost.

462
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,560
Why do you behave aberrant,
uncle?

463
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,160
Then what?

464
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,760
If we attend the marriage,
always ask to have drinks or to boom others!

465
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,200
Durai!

466
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,080
Don't...

467
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,160
I will assent her
if you don't want.

468
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,920
Hey,you come on.

469
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,720
How is my enjoyment?

470
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,240
Uncle,
you will be entrapped.

471
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,200
Uncle,

472
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,440
Look at there!

473
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,920
Children!...

474
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,160
Look at their cheeks.

475
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,080
Yes,
it's a seal.

476
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,160
Come,
let's check it.

477
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,960
Hey Elayarani,

478
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
where to search for you?

479
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,120
Look for me,
where I'm.

480
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,720
Elayarani,

481
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,600
no one is there
in reception.

482
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,400
Will you
please be there?

483
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,120
Yes sister.

484
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,320
Yes.

485
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
Come,
we will go to reception.

486
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:08,560
Come on.

487
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,000
Lai'law!

488
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:23,880
Uncle,

489
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,760
Shall we come in again
through the entrance?

490
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,120
Why?

491
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,040
They are going
to the reception.

492
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,000
We can befriend them
if we enter now.

493
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,640
We can even document.

494
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,320
Come...
Come...

495
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,520
It's enjoyable!

496
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,360
Dude,
the atmosphere is more important.

497
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:34,800
Grab the gift.

498
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,480
Yes uncle.
That's right.

499
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,720
Come soon.

500
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,680
Will they keep it so huge?

501
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,200
What's this?

502
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,640
We must go to
courtallam to take bath.

503
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,240
Go, dude

504
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,200
(Chanting mantras)

505
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,880
Eat well dude.

506
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,440
The food is delicious.

507
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,400
Tastes good.

508
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Can feel the taste
for four days.

509
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,560
Hey...
uncle

510
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,240
Shall we eat again?

511
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,840
Dude,
they will ponder as beggars not as lawyer.

512
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,040
Uncle,
you didn't eat properly.

513
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,400
What is he enacting now?

514
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,360
Okay...
okay...

515
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,120
Rice!

516
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,880
Serve me first.

517
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,520
Not here,

518
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,400
Serve there.

519
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,000
Sambar!

520
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,000
There...
there...

521
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,760
It's enough.

522
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Dude,
you asked me to eat...

523
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,880
Just now you ate.

524
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,960
Let them eat.

525
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,680
It's good.

526
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,760
Rice...

527
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,240
Aah!

528
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,680
Go there.

529
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,240
Rasam...

530
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,880
Dude,
you are very venom.

531
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,680
The gravy is good,isn't it?

532
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Tastes good.

533
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,200
Shall I lick
my fingers?

534
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
How she enjoys the food!

535
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,960
A person from a good family
follows this style.

536
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,800
Video,come here...

537
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,400
Come...

538
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,320
Superb dude!

539
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,720
There...

540
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,600
Yes...
yes...

541
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,720
Why do they
shoot weirdly?

542
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,480
We got more
gifts than expected.

543
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,320
Tell me your name.

544
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,640
Take it.

545
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,640
Write our names.

546
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,200
Durai devar,
Rs.5001,

547
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Why do you
still mention about the caste?

548
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,000
Why not?

549
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,320
"Shilpa Shetty",

550
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,240
"Sameera Reddy",

551
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,320
"Ishwarya Rai",

552
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,240
"Lakshmi Menon"...

553
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,440
When the girls from other states...

554
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,560
...mention their caste
along with names,

555
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Why shouldn't
we use in our state?

556
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,760
Write as Durai devar,
Rs.5001.

557
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,480
How is it,
dude?

558
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,560
This is our teaser.

559
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,880
Write it.

560
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,200
Along with GST!

561
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,200
Ha...

562
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,440
You go now.

563
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,600
Okay,
take care.

564
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,200
We'll go.

565
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,240
Uncle,

566
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,440
What?
Do you want me to gift again?

567
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,640
You are exactly right,
uncle.

568
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,600
I have mistaken it.

569
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,200
Take it.

570
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,960
Govindaraj mooriyar,
Rs.1000.

571
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,800
My dad.

572
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,440
Uncle,give me the Money.
I have only Rs.2000.

573
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,920
Good.

574
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,480
Bhakiyalakshmi,
my mom.

575
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,120
Rs.1000.

576
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,200
Uncle,
give me Rs.100.

577
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,240
Get it back,

578
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,880
Long live "MODI"!

579
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,920
Mathialagan Mooriyar,

580
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,760
It's me.

581
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Do remember me.

582
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,120
Don't forget.

583
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,960
Uncle,
Rs.2000 in your name...

584
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,400
Do you want to gift an amount or
 my whole property?

585
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,440
Go away dude.

586
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,360
Go away.

587
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,160
Uncle...
-Yes.

588
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,680
I decided.

589
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,320
About what?

590
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,120
I ought to lead a
life with her only

591
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,720
So you must...

592
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,480
Me?

593
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,600
Arrange for it.

594
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,080
Dude,does she comes under
our maternal relationship?

595
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,680
Almost I think...

596
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,920
I can't understand.

597
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,840
Tune as a song.

598
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,400
"It's gold! It's gold!"

599
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,080
"Give me..."

600
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,280
"Time is gold!"

601
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,840
"Give me..."

602
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,960
"Everything is gold!"

603
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,120
"Will you come now?"

604
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,280
"Time is gold!"

605
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,160
"My dear uncle! My dear uncle!"

606
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,920
"I can't hold up enough!"

607
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,880
"My dear uncle! My dear uncle!"

608
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,200
"I can't harbor at all."

609
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,840
"Search for her house!"

610
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,360
"The mood of love has started,"

611
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,760
"Just for once,that beauty nod
her head by gazing at me!"

612
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,160
"I become the breeze and swayed in air!"

613
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,160
"I ought to seek that girl,uncle!"

614
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,880
"I ought to hold that girl,uncle!"

615
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,800
"I ought to cuddle that girl,uncle!"

616
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,720
"I ought to kiss her,uncle!"

617
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
"I ought to seek that girl,uncle!"

618
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,160
"I ought to hold that girl,uncle!"

619
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,080
"I ought to cuddle that girl,uncle!"

620
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,000
"I ought to kiss her,uncle!"

621
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,800
"Do you feast upon the stars?"

622
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,080
"Do you imbathe the moon and shines?"

623
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,760
"Whatever happens,I'm with you!"

624
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,560
"When you give me back,I'm with you!"

625
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,800
"You conjoin me, wherever you go around!"

626
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,120
"It's enough,nothing more I need!"

627
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,560
"I ought to seek that girl,uncle!"

628
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,320
"I ought to hold that girl,uncle!"

629
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,200
"I ought to cuddle that girl,uncle!"

630
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,120
"I ought to kiss her,uncle!"

631
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:17,160
"When'll you step with your right
foot to my house?"

632
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,320
"If left now,there is no
auspicious days near."

633
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,160
"Come now,we'll get marry."

634
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,920
"We'll inform others later"

635
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,320
"Will you hold my lustre of love?"

636
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,240
"We'll lead a life with cluster of children!"

637
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,960
"My dear uncle! My dear uncle!"

638
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
"I can't hold up enough!"

639
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,760
"My dear uncle! My dear uncle!"

640
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,240
"I can't harbor at all."

641
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,840
"Search for her house!"

642
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,560
"The mood of love has started,"

643
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,600
"Just for once,that beauty nod
her head by gazing at me!"

644
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,440
"I become the breeze and swayed in air!"

645
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,720
Dude,have you written the exams well?

646
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,560
Amazing!

647
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,480
"I'll sketch out the map and abduct her,"

648
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
"I'm sharp in that task,"

649
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,280
"She is to you!"

650
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,600
"My dear Uncle! I'm very happy!"

651
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,800
"My dear Uncle! I'm very happy!"

652
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,280
SHRIMP FARM, KOVILOOR
PATTUKOTTAI TALUK.

653
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Hey,
untie the ropes.

654
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
It's the complaint
you gave to the collector.

655
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,000
Check whether
it's right.

656
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,880
Read it with the same anger...

657
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,360
...when you had at the time
of giving the complaint.

658
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Request to closure
of the prawns farm.

659
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,320
Koviloor Karunakaran,

660
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,040
For the last fifteen years,

661
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,440
In 300 acres of land
is cultivating Shrimps farm.

662
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,960
The wastage from the
shrimps farm is affecting

663
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,240
the fertility of the neighbouring lands.

664
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,320
Then?

665
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,720
Last year when we protested,

666
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,840
The farmers were fiercely
thrashed by Karunakaran.

667
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,000
Moreover,
the complaint filed on him is

668
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,760
at mute for past eight months.

669
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
As a collector,

670
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:12,080
you have to save us and
our agricultural lands.

671
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,600
We request you
to do this favour.

672
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Hey,
when you can't save yourself...

673
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,280
...you thrive to save agriculture.

674
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,280
Who is beneath you?

675
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,760
He is Kanthangudi Govindaraj Mooriyar

676
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,000
Owner of Coconut market.

677
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,960
If he bawl here,
will it be audible to him?

678
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,480
Give the iron lynch.

679
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,760
Fizzle out now.

680
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,600
No...

681
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,520
No...

682
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,400
It's painful.

683
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,720
Don't thrash us.

684
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,280
We beg you.

685
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,440
Leave us.

686
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
Leave us.

687
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,120
Tell the clan to wait
who comes from the society.

688
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,080
Yes,
I'll tell.

689
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,000
Brother,

690
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,840
Yes dear.

691
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,280
Brother is like a temple.

692
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,200
Yes,
yes.

693
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,080
Yesterday it was
 your father,

694
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,640
Today it's your brother.

695
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,040
Be silent.

696
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,960
Bro,
I want Rs.5000 now.

697
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
For what?

698
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,160
We are going on
 tour from college.

699
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
Lord!

700
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,000
Take it.

701
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,280
Brother is not a temple.

702
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,840
Hmm.

703
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,400
You switched over as soon as
you got the money.

704
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,800
Brother,you are my god!

705
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,320
Go safe.

706
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Selvarani,keep it.

707
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,760
Why brother?

708
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,920
You don't ask for anything.

709
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,760
Keep it.

710
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,560
Hmm.

711
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,800
Hey,Elayarani...

712
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,240
Even today she left
without taking breakfast.

713
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,280
Greetings madam!

714
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,640
Greetings!

715
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,720
Welcome Mandiramoorthy,

716
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,760
Welcome.

717
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,280
Welcome Mandiramoorthy,

718
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,080
Welcome.

719
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,640
You welcome me but not
letting the way in.

720
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,120
Why do you come here?

721
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,240
Sir told me to come to discuss about
bridegroom to your elder daughter.

722
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,520
Sir went to Bombay.

723
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,080
To Bombay?

724
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,520
Yes.

725
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,000
No chance at all.

726
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,480
Hmm...

727
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,080
He won't go without informing me.

728
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,680
How he went?
And why he went?

729
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,400
Mandiramoorthy,
did he married me or you?

730
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,920
To inform you wherever he goes.

731
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
No...

732
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,000
What no?

733
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,720
He told me clearly.

734
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,680
About what?

735
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,280
To come home
at the time of breakfast.

736
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,680
He told that we will discuss
the things by dining.

737
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,720
Oh!

738
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,280
Now the problem is not
that sir went to Bombay.

739
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,360
But the breakfast!

740
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Take it.

741
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,040
Either you eat
and go or go and eat.

742
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,840
Mandiramoorthy,don't forget to
get the plate tomorrow.

743
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,360
Aah...

744
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,720
Why do you insist him to come?

745
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,280
How many times to tell you that
our daughter must marry my nephew?

746
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,800
Both the families are
not even in communication.

747
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,560
But you are dreaming of blues!

748
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,720
It will happen.

749
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,640
I have hope.

750
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,800
How is the board?

751
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,720
Superb bro!

752
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,080
Dude has come.

753
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
What's this uncle?

754
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,720
Office of the lawyer.

755
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,280
Look at there.

756
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,880
Mathialagan Mooriyar, B.A., B.L,

757
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,320
How is it?

758
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,200
Advance and rent amount must be
soaring high at the main road.

759
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,600
Don't practice all those.

760
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,840
It's occupied.

761
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,920
We occupied it.

762
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,280
Hmm...

763
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,320
Have you done the exams well?

764
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,240
Yes.

765
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Hmm.

766
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,320
Grabbed this chain
from the pawn broker.

767
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,760
We'll sell it and buy
the books on law.

768
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,240
It'll be useful for reference.

769
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,800
To whom?

770
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,920
Dude!

771
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,720
To me!

772
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,120
I'm thorough with the rules of law.

773
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,480
Just waiting to...

774
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,120
Do it safe.

775
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,520
Oh.

776
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:07,960
What guys?

777
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,520
Yes bro.

778
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,080
Shall we have a cup of tea?
Be seated.

779
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,680
Take the stone.

780
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,480
Take it bro.

781
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,320
Which one is bigger?

782
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,000
This one bro,

783
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,360
Hey,why do you throw stone?

784
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,880
I called you.

785
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,800
Don't stare.

786
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,520
Get us the tea.

787
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,120
How many?

788
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,000
Give the other stone.

789
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,520
Take it bro.

790
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,720
He must be...

791
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,320
Dude,

792
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,680
Aren't you searching for your heroine?

793
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,800
Look at there.

794
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,120
Oh,is this the parking area?

795
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,240
Hi,
-Hi,

796
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
Bus will be late it seems.

797
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,280
Oh...

798
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,640
Then what to do?

799
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,880
We can do whatever we wish.
-Let's have a tea.

800
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,640
Order for tea.

801
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,520
I won't talk with him.

802
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,800
Bro,five cups of tea.

803
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,760
Is it light or strong?

804
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,640
If it's strong means,
will you add cement and bricks to it?

805
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,840
Hey...hey...

806
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,160
Uncle,they are going beyond limits.

807
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,920
Shall we chide them?

808
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,520
Leave it dude.

809
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,280
It's the attitude of the youngsters.

810
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,680
Are we oldsters then?

811
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,800
She is going to step
into our house in future,

812
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,920
Is it good,
if she disrespect you?

813
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,040
Dude,have you did the exams well?

814
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,960
Yes,moulded the answers like sweet.

815
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,240
Then chide her.

816
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Hey,come here.

817
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,400
Brother.

818
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,360
That girl...

819
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,080
Call that girl who wears blue salwar,

820
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,280
Yes brother.

821
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,280
Call her...

822
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,120
Call her.

823
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,560
What?

824
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,720
Call her.

825
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,160
I was told it's some other job.

826
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,480
Hello.

827
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:44,880
Yes.

828
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,960
Brother called you.

829
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,200
Brother? Who's that?

830
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,960
The handsome guy sitting on the bike,
he called you.

831
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,840
Handsome?

832
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,560
Oh...

833
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Don't be panic.Come now.

834
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Can have tea later.

835
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,280
What does he do?

836
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,760
He is waiting.Come on.

837
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,840
She comes dude.

838
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Somehow engage her.

839
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,960
Brother...

840
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Aah!

841
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,840
Yes brother,

842
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,960
It's you brother.

843
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,600
Did you call me,brother?

844
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,200
He said that you called me.

845
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,680
Why did you call me?

846
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,920
Nothing.Just like that...

847
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,920
Brother,I know.

848
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,960
You won't call without a reason.

849
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,920
Tell me brother.

850
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,120
Nothing.You may go.

851
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,560
Elayarani,bus has arrived.

852
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,360
Hey,is that important?

853
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,440
I'm conversing to brother.

854
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,160
I'll hit you.

855
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,760
Tell me brother,

856
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,640
why did you call me?

857
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,560
Go... go and study well.

858
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,360
That's why I called you.

859
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,240
Aah,it's good.

860
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,760
You won't call me without a reason.

861
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,960
Brother,I will study well
and enrich your name.

862
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,320
Go...

863
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,200
Study and enrich your name first.

864
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,040
Hmm...

865
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,200
Brother,money for tea?

866
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,000
We have given in advance for a week.

867
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,360
You may go.

868
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,920
Thanks bulky brother.

869
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,800
Dude,she tease me.

870
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,760
Brother!

871
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,720
What?

872
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,800
Bro,now you are in anger.

873
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
I'll come in the evening.

874
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,600
We will chit chat happily
with tea and snacks.

875
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,720
Uncle...

876
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,440
Go away...

877
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,440
Bye brother.

878
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
Bye bulky brother.

879
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,040
I'll slay her now.

880
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,320
We must slay her boss.

881
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,480
First you must be done.

882
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,760
Hard to work with him.

883
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,800
She must have splashed!

884
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,360
Shall we go?

885
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,040
Who are they?

886
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,760
What did he ask?

887
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,240
They are the flex board party.

888
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,520
They insulted "Prabhas of Bahubali movie."

889
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,920
Oh...oh...

890
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,600
Sitting idle,they creates
buzz as brother calls.

891
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,800
If they stay here till evening,

892
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,960
I'll make them to race.

893
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,200
Okay...okay...

894
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,880
Start the vehicle.

895
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,880
Instead she would've
scolded me in cuss words.

896
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,400
Don't cry dude.

897
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,280
Bye.

898
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,000
Go away.

899
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,760
No uncle.

900
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,160
She is our in-law.

901
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
I can't hold up when
she called as brother.

902
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,480
Tea?

903
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,640
How dare you spilled
the tea on my son-in-law?

904
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:39,960
Get me water.

905
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,840
Hey,stop the vehicle.

906
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,560
Brother,

907
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,320
Brother, come here.

908
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,000
Yes brother,

909
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Where is Govindaraj Mooriyar's
coconut market?

910
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,920
He is my father.

911
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,640
What do you want?

912
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,400
I must meet him.

913
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,320
Greetings!

914
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,400
I'm Karunakaran.

915
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
Hope you know well.

916
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,520
"The Shrimps farm."

917
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Even the parents might
haven't feed the children.

918
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,160
But the farmer feeds
even the beggar.

919
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,440
Why do you think of
destructing the agriculture?

920
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,160
No...no...

921
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,320
I didn't even tell you to sit
because of anger.

922
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,840
Be seated.

923
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,480
I'm not here to sit.

924
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,200
I want to convey you some stuff.

925
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,240
Sending requisitions to collector
on closure of Shrimps farm,

926
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,400
Protesting at the corner of post office,

927
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,160
Observing hunger strike with downtrodden,

928
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,440
Tell them to leave all that
and work in my farm.

929
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,960

930
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,600
Hey...hey...

931
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,160
To whom are you talking?

932
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,600

933
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,480

You be seated.

935
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,000
Bro,the shrimps business
is not a gain to us,

936
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,520
you export it to abroad.

937
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,240
Don't that countries
have shrimps and sea?

938
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,760
Someone is trying to bilge our country,

939
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,680
you stand by it.

940
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,480
Isn't it wrong?

941
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,240
What is he upto?

942
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,680
Mooriyar,I will nurture
even snakes if I get money.

943
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,280
Whether it clamps or cuddles.
That's my problem,

944
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,200
Mind your business.

945
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,240
What's your problem now?

946
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:18,800
Hey Arivu...

947
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,240

950
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,080
Just wait.

951
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,360
No need to hesitate still.

952
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,440
We will decide on it.

953
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,040
Okay brother.

954
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,120
Raja,

955
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:34,600

Yes brother.

958
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,320
Arivu,let's look at it later.

959
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,880
Do you need a board
for a single way?

960
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,160
Not even a single case must be
missed without knowing the way.

961
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,680
Yes.

962
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,440
Be careful.

963
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,840
They didn't go yet.

964
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,640
Hammer it well.

965
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,960
Hey uncle,look at there.

966
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,360
She comes in jest mood.

968
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,000
Go to office,dude.

969
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,920
Hurry up.

970
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,520
Go...go soon.

971
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,800
Hey,whoever asks us,
tell that we went to Tanjore.

972
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,360
Ok brother.

973
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,680
Tell that we went to meet
Prime minister Manmohan singh.

974
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,160

975
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,680
Don't harass me.

976
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,920
Hide now.

977
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,920

979
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,680
Oh! Hmm...

980
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,440
Hmm...

981
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,080
To Tanjore?

982
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,320
When he'll be back?

983
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,560
Why do you ask all that?

984
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,200
I met a rogue in college,

985
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,840
Remembered your brother

986
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,120

Why do you remember my brother?

988
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,400
I must get him over
there and hit the rogue.

989
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,120
She creates a show.

990
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,440
Okay, give me your
brother's contact number.

991
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,760
He must be busy.

992
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,200
Give me the number.

993
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,960
He won't attend unknown numbers.

994
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Oh,is he that much busy?

995
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,080

996
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,280

999

1003
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,040
Look at me and talk.

1004
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,560
You are too young.

1005
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,200
Hmm....

1006
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,440
Keep quite.

1007
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,560

1008
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,040
She thinks herself as
"Devar Magan SHIVAJI"

1009
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,880
Ever orders to be quite.

1010
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,640
Tell me,

1013
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,040
It's not here.

1014
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:20,680
Where is it?

1015
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,200
Search well.

1016
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,520
Mass!

1017
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,840
Phone must be ringing!

1018
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,400
Don't take the phone.

1019
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,640
She took the phone.

1020
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,320
Leave it,dude.

1021
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,360
Give me the phone.

1022
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,760
He left the phone here
without any responsibility,

1023
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,600
What is he doing in Tanjore?

1024
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,840
She catch the right point.

1025
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,080
Don't move up.

1026
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,680
First,the bulky person
must be punished.

1027
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,600
Who is bulky?

1028
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Don't push me.

1029
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,840
Tell him to meet me
and get the phone.

1030
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,120
Okay?

1031
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,600

1034
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,280
Keep quite.

1035
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,160
Hello...

1036
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,400
Why did you give his number?

1037
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,080
Can't you give some other?

1038
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,320
I won't tell lies.

1039
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,320
What?
Don't you tell lies?

1040
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,760
You would've told us when
taking up the job.

1041
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,560
Now call my number and tell her
to get my phone immediately.

1042
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,680

1043
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,920

1045
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,600
He is very angry.

1046
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,120
He wants the phone immediately.

1047
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,000
Is it okay?

1048
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,440
It seems you will lead
her though she forgets.

1049
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,160
Thrash him.

1050
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,080
Thrash him.

1051
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,760
Is it okay to say as Mathi?

1052
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,680
I never called his name.
How dare you say it?

1053
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
Close the shutter.

1054
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,360
Kill him.

1055
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,600
Give me the salary and hit later.

00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,200
Betrayers.

1060
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,720
Lift me up.

1061
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,160

00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,000
Check this folder.

1067
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,280
Wait.

1068
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,760
You don't know anything.

1069
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,040
Hey,

1070
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,720
It must be in that.

We will use it.

1078
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,520
A hidden folder in it.

00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,720
Sure a stuff must be there.

1080
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,920
It asks for password.

1081
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,000
Better try with zeros and lines,
that's the password used by guys.

1082
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,960
Try out something.

1083
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,680
Hey,it's opened up.

1084
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,880
You must tell instead of asking me.

1085
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,360
Selvarani!

1086
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:22,880

00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,280
Does she hear me or not?

1097

1113
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,880

00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,760
Bye.

1117
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,600
Check the phone.

1118
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,960
I don't know what to do?

1119
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,400
At what time they'll come?

1120
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,600
It's time for the bus.

1121
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,600
They'll come now.

1122
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,640
I must get the phone.

1123
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:38,520
(A song from the movie
“Baahubali”)

1124
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,840
Hey,Uncle is coming with a statue.

1125
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,400
(A song from the movie
“Baahubali”)

1126
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,120
We can't harbor it.

1127
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,840
Solely he lifted the statue.

1128
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,480
Hey,come here.

1129
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,560
Keep it down.

1130
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,200
Be careful.

1131
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,120
Uncle,is it Bahubali-2 version?

1132
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,000
Greetings aunty!
-Greetings!

1133
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,600
Bahubali-20 is here.

1134
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,440
What happened?

1135
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,240
Listen to this tale.

1136
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:00,600
Tell me.

1137
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,520
Your aunt went to temple as usual.

1138
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,000
Okay.

1139
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,640
The priest told her to stand in a queue.

1140
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,160
Then?

1141
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,480
Is she going to get aadhar card
to stand in a queue?

1142
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,120
Hmm.

1143
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,400
She said she is in hurry.

1144
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,000
That's all.

1145
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,120
The priest told her to go to
another temple,if in hurry.

1146
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,000
Then?

1147
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
Is it release of actor Ajith's movie?

1148
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,160
To go to another theatre,if not here?

1149
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,480
Yes.

1150
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,800
She came weeping.

1151
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,200
You know well.

1152
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,720
I create arson just for a hand shake.

1153
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,600
If she weeps?

1154
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,400
Then you must be furious.

1155
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Frenzied out.

1156
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,000
Hmm.

1157
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,360
I went straight to temple,

1158
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,400
I adhered my hands with that of priest.

1159
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,960
Just a small twist.

1160
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,360
Then?

1161
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,400
Bloodshed in his hand!

1162
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,640
It's a fracture.

1163
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,200
Then?

1164
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,000
He told me to go with the deity
 first and he'll follow me.

1165
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,600
As he was panic,
it seems he knows our stuff.

1166
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,440
What's the stuff?

1167
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,880
It's that you had
written the exams well.

1168
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,320
Is it?

1169
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,640
What is it?

1170
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,520
Is it?

1171
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,280
That is!

1172
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,120
My breathe stopped for a minute.

1173
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,920
It's so funny.

1174
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,240
Get aunt there.

1175
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,600
What dude?

1176
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,440
No...no...

1177
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
Catch her.

1178
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,080
Where do you run?

1179
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,800
Where is she?

1180
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,520
Why do they run?

1181
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,360
Ask them.

1182
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,160
They ran away.

1183
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,680
Where is your friend?

1184
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,520
I didn't see her from yesterday evening.

1185
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,320
Did you go to bar?

1186
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:09,760
No...

1187
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,920
Don't be elusive.

1188
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,960
She must come here
now with my phone.

1189
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,120
You must also come
along with her.

1190
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,320
If not,you can't leave from here.

1191
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,360
Dude,shall I lift her?

1192
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,000
Get the bottle.

1193
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,320
Okay brother.

1194
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,760
It's not fair.

1195
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,760
She has broken the phone,

1196
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,480
Is the phone broken?

1197
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,360
She didn't broke it.

1198
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,400
It was broken on its own.

1199
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,600
How it's possible?

1200
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,760
Is that automatic phone?

1201
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,680
Break the bottle and pierce her.

1202
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,240
No...no...
I'll tell.

1203
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,720
Where are you looking at?

1204
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,120
She finished the narration.

1205
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,800
On the whole,
phone was damaged.

1206
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,400
Yes.

1207
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:47,960
Where is she?

1208
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,080
Afraid of you,
she is in home only.

1209
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,640
If you inquire,
she told me to tell as she got fever.

1210
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,080
Is it?

1211
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:54,600
Yes sir.

1212
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
Don't tell her that I informed you.

1213
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:58,840
Hmm... okay.

1214
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,480
I too expect the same.

1215
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,520
You don't tell her
that you informed me.

1216
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,120
Superb dude!

1217
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,960
Let her stay with fever.

1218
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,320
Yes.

1219
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,080
This is our ploy.

1220
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,280
How is it uncle?

1221
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,760
Good dude.

1222
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
Oh no!

1223
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,280
She runs.
Come fast.

1224
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,720
Grandma,if anyone inquire about me
tell them I'm not here.

1225
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,800
No one inquired.

1226
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,480
Then how to tell?

1227
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,600
I'll lynch you,granny.

1228
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,320
Come dude,we must get a solution.

1229
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,160
Tell that I have come.
I've come back.

1230
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,400
Come in...come in...

1231
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,160
We have come.

1232
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,960
Who are they?

1233
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,560
Brother.

1234
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,280
Brother of my friend,granny.

1235
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,320
What happened?

1236
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,000
Fever!

1237
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,400
What happened to the phone?

1238
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,000
You mean fan?
I'll switch on.

1239
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,320
First,you switch on the light.

1240
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,560
At first,you take the coolers.

1241
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,760
Do you like to
 have a cup of coffee?

1242
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,560
Juice...

1243
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,000
We didn't come for it.

1244
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,600
Oh,Will you have tea then?

1245
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,240
Don't you know
why we have come here?

1246
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
Oh,you want to have milk?

1247
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,040
We don't have that habit.

1248
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,920
Oh good!
Your parents brought up you well.

1249
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,320
But your parents didn't...

1250
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,760
That's it.

1251
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,040
I can't manage beyond this.

1252
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,440
Hope you can understand.

1253
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,320
Please leave.

1254
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,880
My brother will be back.

1255
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,880
He'll bland me.

1256
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,600
Leave now.

1257
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,960
I'll give the phone tomorrow.

1258
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,560
You laughed.

1259
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,480
Then you'll leave,

1260
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:13,840
Look at her.

1261
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,080
You laugh good.

1262
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,520
So you must leave immediately.

1263
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,440
Wonder,how you will manage her?

1264
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,960
Hey...

1265
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,560
Without any hint,
you are coming back!

1266
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,800
Will you surely come tomorrow?

1267
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,280
Yes,I'm sure.

1268
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,840
What to do if you won't come?

1269
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,920
If she doesn't come,

1270
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,360
I'll send you a message.

1271
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,160
Will you be in WhatsApp after 8 pm?

1272
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,040
I'll be in bar after 8 pm

1273
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,720
Those who must be in emergency
ward is following WhatsApp.

1274
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,040
They left.

1275
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,920
Is it multi purpose flour or wheat flour?

1276
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,400
What's this?

1277
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Phone is inside the flour.

1278
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,560
Flour is inside the phone.

1279
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:51,760
Hmm.

1280
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,160
It may cost Rs.7000 to repair your phone.

1281
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,480
What do you say?

1282
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,080
It must be modified completely.

1283
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,240
Is it your shop to be modified?

1284
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,320
Your phone.

1285
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,080
Can you offer any discount?

1286
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,400
Is it okay,
if you get only incoming calls?

1287
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:05,960
Brother,

1288
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,120
what word you uttered?

1289
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,560
Did I yell foul?

1290
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,760
It costs Rs.7000,
 I'll get ready with the phone.

1291
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,720
You get ready with the money.

1292
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,400
Okay,you repair the phone.

1293
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,080
I'll arrange for the money.

1294
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,720
Go...

1295
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:17,800
Go...

1296
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,160
Everyone seems to be in frustration!

1297
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,200
I must enter the class without
known to anyone.

1298
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,880
For Rs.7000 worth phone,
I have to act worth ten times more of it.

1299
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,640
Good morning sir!

1300
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,640
What happened?

1301
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,560
Fever sir.

1302
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,120
So doctor told me to be
in rest for couple of days

1303
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,480
I came to college as
studies are important.

1304
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,160
I asked about Phone.

1305
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,360
I'll come to your place to give it,sir.

1306
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,360
You may leave.

1307
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,400
I'll stay back and get my phone.

1308
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,520
Why do you wait in the hot sun?

1309
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,680
You'll become dark,sir.

1310
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,440
It's okay.

1311
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,960
Why do you lose your glamour?

1312
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,280
I'll take care of it.

1313
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,480
We must also see.

1314
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,440
Nowadays, girls adore fair
complexion guys than dark.

1315
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,720
Laugh a little,sir.

1316
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,920
I have to tell you
each and every time.

1317
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,320
Oh my god!

1318
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,080
Now,I must know
where is my phone.

1319
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,240
My friend Mala...

1320
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,320
You don't know her,right?

1321
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,240
It's good.

1322
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,160
She looks so cute.

1323
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:22,640
Hmm.

1324
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,760
She took your phone.

1325
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,840
Her grandparents were
celebrating their anniversary.

1326
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,800
So,you gifted her my phone.

1327
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:36,920
Oh...No way,
Good comedy

1328
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,240
Can laugh at it for the whole day.

1329
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,960
The bell has given.

1330
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,680
I'll laugh out the balance
in the evening,sir.

1331
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,760
Sorry,I'll get the phone
from mala and give you.

1332
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,200
You leave now, bye sir.

1333
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,720
Bye.

1334
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,200
It's okay.I'll wait.

1335
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,400
Dear students,concentration is more
important for biostatics class.

1336
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,160
Okay?

1337
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,680
Do you understand?

1338
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,360
According to this formula,

1339
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,640
everyone must heed to..

1340
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,480
Will you obey me?

1341
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,200
Go...

1342
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,240
Heed to...

1343
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,120
Is he calling to watch movie?

1344
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:16,840
Are you going?

1345
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:17,640
Hmm.

1346
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,400
Elayarani,

1347
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,120
Sir.

1348
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,960
I'll put the chair in garden,

1349
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,320
Will both of you chat freely there?

1350
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,040
Not necessary sir.

1351
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,360
Why must you feel tiring?

1352
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,560
Is it tiring?

1353
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,600
He pass signals from outside.

1354
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,440
You retort to him from here.

1355
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,640
Are we paid by the government
to witness it?

1356
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,800
You must be thrashed.

1357
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,920
Hey,get up.

1358
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,800
Rice ball head!

1359
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,360
What's the murmurs?

1360
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,400
I said,"I'm very sorry sir."

1361
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,120
Who?

1362
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,120
It's you?

1363
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:45,760
Hmm.

1364
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,840
That too,
To me?

1365
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,440
Now you want me to go out
of the class,

1366
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,080
isn't it sir?

1367
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,640
Hey mocker,will you decide
it on your own?

1368
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,720
Now I tell you to get out.
Get out.

1369
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,960
Get out.

1370
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,240
Demon!

1371
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:58,840
Rice ball!

1372
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,120
Get lost.

1373
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,680
You get lost from the job.

1374
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,080
Get lost.

1375
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,600
See her.

1376
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,720
It's inauspicious day it seems.

1377
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,360
Hey,come on.

1378
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,760
I have to explain everything.

1379
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,320
I got phone call from Mala,sir.

1380
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,600
Then give my phone.

1381
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,360
I said she called me.

1382
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,240
What happened?

1383
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,960
Didn't I tell you that her grandparents
are celebrating their anniversary.

1384
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,400
Yes.

1385
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:27,000
At that happiest moment,
they both were demised.

1386
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,240
Mala crying a lot sir.

1387
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,360
Crying...Crying...

1388
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,080
Hey...

1389
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,040
Don't you have at least
 a little conscience?

1390
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,680
You celebrated their anniversary
in the morning

1391
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,760
and dumped them by evening.

1392
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,360
Is it believable?

1393
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,440
I'm going to ask the same
query to her,sir.

1394
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,160
How many people were crucified
today in her tales?

1395
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,760
I must crucify you first.

1396
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,400
If you won't give me the phone,
I'll dump you.

1397
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,280
Believe me,sir.

1398
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,280
I'll give your phone by evening.

1399
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,040
I promise on you.

1400
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,880
Sorry sir,
it's a promise on me.

1401
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,960
Just now that professor went to canteen.

1402
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,800
I can get in only after he leaves.

1403
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,680
Sir,you go now.

1404
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,360
I'll get you by evening.

1405
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,800
I'll keep up my word.

1406
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,240
"Belief is life."
"Life moves on by belief."

1407
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,120
It's confusing.

1408
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,760
Hey yellow shirt,
believe me!

1409
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,920
Govindaraj Mooriyar,Head of Agricultural society,
Pattukottai taluk,

1410
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:29,920
has filed a public welfare case
against Karunakaran of Koviloor.

1411
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,960
...As the wastage from the
Shrimps farm cultivated by Karunakaran,

1412
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,480
...is polluting the fertile lands.

1413
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,720
Still how many days to hide?

1414
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:48,240
I'll consummate everything today.

1415
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,680
Is there any notion in your kit?

1416
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,760
No.

1417
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,040
Then how?

1418
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,720
Notion emerges impromptu
when looking at his face.

1419
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,800
See how I'll manage with that...

1420
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,600
Hey...

1421
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,680
Sir,when talking about a piety,

1422
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,120
a good personality stands in front of me.

1423
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,560
Sir,I learnt a deterrent example from you.

1424
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,600
What's that?

1425
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,000
Mala is very fraud.

1426
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,360
Who? She?

1427
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,320
Hmm.

1428
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,080
She says phone is here and there.

1429
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,200
Finally,she has given the phone in the shop.

1430
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,960
Why she must give the phone in shop?

1431
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,040
Known that you are more familiar in Pattukottai.

1432
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,920
Is it?

1433
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,720
Hmm.

1434
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
She said that she'll return the
phone after service of it as it's VIP's.

1435
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,000
I never heard of this in my experience.

1436
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,640
I asked the same query to her.

1437
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,120
For that she replied...

1438
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,760
Tell me.

1439
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,120
It's a terrific comedy,
if you listen to it.

1440
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,120
When we get pulses to flour mill,
they were broken into fine flour.

1441
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,520
So,you had broken the phone.

1442
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,360
I told about the pulses.

1443
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,640
I asked about the phone.

1444
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,240
Huh!...

1445
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,720
Hey,where is my phone?

1446
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,160
You are mislaying words!

1447
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,520
Now your shaft is going to solidify.

1448
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,400
You are crossing your limits!

1449
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,320
Now I'm going to cling
a mask in your face.

1450
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,440
Everyone is staring at us.

1451
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,040
Let them know,
the way you cheated.

1452
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,160
The backlash will be worst.

1453
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,400
Won't you subdue still?

1454
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Get me to the shop.

1455
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,600
Hi,

1456
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,920
To whom are you waving hands
when no one greets you?

1457
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,200
Don't touch me.

1458
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,560
It's my area.

1459
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,280
So,if I touch?

1460
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,440
Then you will be grazed.

1461
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,080
How is it?

1462
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,760
Comedy...

1463
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,000
Naughty.

1464
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,720
Yes.

1465
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,200
Boss,

1466
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:25,800
Sir.

1467
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,440
Give me the rope.

1468
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,240
Take it.

1469
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,080
Is he your classmate?

1470
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,480
It'll be known later.

1471
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,720
Is it?

1472
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,800
First,show me the shop.

1473
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:33,600
Is this one?

1474
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,960
It's fertiliser shop.

1475
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,160
Is that one?

1476
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,400
That's timber shop.

1477
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,720
Is it ode?

1478
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,920
Do you like it?

1479
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,280
Will kick you now.

1480
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,440
Show me the shop.

1481
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,320
I'll give it tomorrow.

1482
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:44,880
Show me,

1483
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,920
Get lost.

1484
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,760
Tomorrow...

1485
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,040
Hurry up.

1486
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,000
They smashed us.

1487
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,640
Uncle,what happened?

1488
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,200
What happened?

1489
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,360
Why everyone is standing out?

1490
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,960
Why the market is closed?

1491
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,240
Uncle,what happened?

1492
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,280
Tell me.

1493
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,160
Thrash them.

1494
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,440
Go and get the keys.

1495
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,960
Get lost.

1496
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,960
Hey,close the gate.

1497
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,320
Sir,they smashed us.

1498
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,000
Hey,what are you doing here?

1499
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,160
Who closed the market?

1500
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,680
Hey,stop it.

1501
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,640
Your brother gets order
from the court

1502
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,080
and come along with collector
and commissioner.

1503
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,920
to close my shrimps farm.

1504
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,040
But I came alone to lock
the coconut market.

1505
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,960
Let him get the keys
if he is dare enough.

1506
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,120
Hey,if you talk anything
ill about my brother...

1507
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,360
How you dare to close my farm?

1508
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,160
Now It's my turn.

1509
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,720
Show it to your brother.

1510
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,560
Hey...

1511
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,120
Brother...

1512
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,040
Brother...

1513
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,640
If you are the doyen here,
he is the doyen in other zone.

1514
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,200
Can't you be calm,Karuna?

1515
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,160
Is that Kalaiyarasi?

1516
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,480
Come in Kalaiyarasi,

1517
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,320
Come in son-in-law.

1518
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,160
Be seated.

1519
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,960
Karuna,she is your aunt Kalaiyarasi.

1520
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,040
He is your nephew,Karunakaran.

1521
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,440
I have to introduce the relationships.

1522
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:34,720
Be seated,aunt.

1523
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,080
It's okay.

1524
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,320
Get coffee for them.

1525
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,280
Okay brother.

1526
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,080
It's okay,

1527
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,600
let it be.

1528
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,760
I didn't get you anything
because of urgency.

1529
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:45,680
It's okay,aunt.

1530
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,480
You have come,

1531
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:49,640
that's enough.

1532
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,280
What happened?

1533
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,200
A brawl in Shrimps farm.

1534
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,720
Why do you get into brawl?

1535
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,600
Didn't my brother come?

1536
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,600
Known that you are coming,
he left just now.

1537
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,280
Don't know still how long
he'll carry on the angst.

1538
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,400
When the good time may come?

1539
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,560
It'll come.

1540
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,320
It'll come.

1541
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,680
Don't worry.

1542
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,160
Uncle!

1543
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,600
Kalaiyarasi only stumbles
for relationships.

1544
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:30,760
Her brother invited everyone
for Karuna's marriage,

1545
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,880
But didn't even utter a word to us.

1546
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,440
You too didn't invite us for
brother-in-law's marriage.

1547
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,960
We thought of inviting...

1548
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,240
You repeat the same.

1549
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,720
You say they didn't give the invitation,

1550
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,800
He says you didn't
invite for the marriage.

1551
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,440
What's the solution if you
extend on the words.

1552
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,080
You are looking for a bridegroom
to your elder daughter.

1553
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,080
He is searching for a bride to his brother.

1554
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,840
Both of you discuss and decide
about their marriage and invite all.

1555
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,160
Is it okay?

1556
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,480
Don't cry.

1557
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,840
Rajangam,

1558
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,160
we'll find an auspicious day for engagement.

1559
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,800
And invite all for the grand occasion.

1560
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:19,880
Is it okay?

1561
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,840
Uncle,you must make
it a good occasion.

1562
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,560
Sure.

1563
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,880
Everything will be good.

1564
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,240
Are you happy,son-in-law?

1565
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:27,840
Yes uncle.

1566
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,560
We'll leave.

1567
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,640
Take care of your health.
Yes uncle.

1568
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,560
Karuna,I'll send off them.

1569
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,120
Okay.

1570
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,040
Come...Come...

1571
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,040
Find out who has attacked
brother-in-law.

1572
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,680
He must be lynched.

1573
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,680
Hey,what's this bag?

1574
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,720
As I query for the phone,
have you decided to leave to other zone?

1575
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,480
Just now the shop is open.

1576
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:58,840
Here is your phone.

1577
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,280
Okay,what's this bag?

1578
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,040
I got it to go on tour.

1579
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,000
Tour?

1580
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,240
Yes sir.

1581
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,520
Our college students are going on a tour.

1582
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,400
Is it?

1583
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Yes.

1584
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:10,280
Okay,come with me.

1585
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,360
I'll drop you in college.

1586
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,600
How to go,sir?

1587
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,480
I repaired your phone with the tour fee.

1588
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,040
What do you say in home?

1589
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,120
Why do you bother,sir?

1590
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,280
You got the phone.

1591
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:20,840
Leave now.

1592
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,880
What do you say in home?

1593
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,040
Somehow I'll manage.
what's your problem?

1594
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,400
What do you say in home?

1595
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,200
That's why I came in a
hurry in the morning.

1596
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:35,280
I'll tell them by shedding tears that
I missed the bus though I went early.

1597
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,720
Everyone will believe me in home.

1598
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,360
Okay,we'll go.

1599
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,760
We'll go.

1600
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,480
Where to go?

1601
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,240
Listen to me,come.

1602
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:54,520
Sir,

1603
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,520
Why?

1604
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:57,840
Hmm.

1605
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:10,920
Take it.

1606
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,520
Go.

1607
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,000
I can't go without money.

1608
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,480
You may go.

1609
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,520
How can I go,
when I got back the money?

1610
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,840
I kept money in your bag.

1611
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,280
Go...

1612
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:39,800
Mathi,

1613
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:41,800
your phone!

1614
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,360
Did I hang around you just
to get this phone?

1615
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:27,800
"I fleet as a dragonfly,"

1616
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:33,560
"I waft as a bird,"

1617
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,280
"Enchanted a little,asked for consort,"

1618
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,000
"You has bequeath me your heart."

1619
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:45,480
"To adore your beauty,
you conquered me fully."

1620
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,440
"I stride on the down hill as an ant,"

1621
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:54,200
"I bear you in my head as
sweetened sugar,"

1622
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,720
"I fleet as a dragonfly,"

1623
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:05,040
"I waft as a bird,"

1624
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,120
“Like the dust which heave high,
when the breeze waves"

1625
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,960
"Drizzled as drops, "

1626
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,800
"Subdued at earthward,"

1627
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,880
"Prattle with words,"

1628
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,920
"You listen to me whole heartedly,"

1629
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:52,400
"You breathe for me,"

1630
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:57,840
"Drizzles along with the
hot sun is a wonder,"

1631
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:03,680
"I was counting on the time
you come closer to me",

1632
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,520
"As avowed all that,

1633
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,320
I came closer to you".

1634
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:15,400
"Like a dragonfly,

1635
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:17,960
I fleet like a dragonfly,"

1636
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,200
"Like a bird,

1637
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,240
I waft like a bird."

1638
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,760
"The beautiful look you stare at me,

1639
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,680
Is sweetened now,"

1640
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:59,280
"How you transposed me?"

1641
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,000
"When rain pours,"

1642
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,280
"I ramble as a cattle,"

1643
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,200
"You waved me the leaf,"

1644
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,520
"I nod my head."

1645
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,920
"You turn over my mind
as a betel leaf,"

1646
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:21,640
"You clocked up my mind after
additions and omissions."

1647
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,480
"The line you hold up for me,"

1648
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:30,160
"My heart is your dwelling place,"

1649
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:35,680
"I fleet as a dragonfly,"

1650
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:41,720
"I waft as a bird,"

1651
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:47,720
"Enchanted a little,asked for consort,"

1652
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:53,160
"To adore your beauty,
you conquered me fully."

1653
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,800
Do the homework.

1654
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,920
Where are you going
without having food?

1655
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:13,680
Today i'm getting the results.

1656
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,640
Will check and eat later.

1657
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,920
Pray god and go.

1658
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:16,760
Everything will be good.

1659
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,320
Yes dad.

1660
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:17,760
Hmm.

1661
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,200
Hi dude,

1662
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,400
What's this,uncle?

1663
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,480
It's the police vehicle.

1664
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,400
I know that.

1665
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,200
A new vehicle! police attire!

1666
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,560
I can't understand anything.

1667
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,680
What's the day today?

1668
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,240
Today comes my result.

1669
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,560
It's judgemental day.

1670
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,360
Oh...

1671
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,080
Why do you wear this police attire?

1672
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,600
Why to ask it?

1673
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,800
I was in a hurry to check the results.

1674
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,360
Okay.

1675
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,120
On the way,at the bridge a
policeman stopped me.

1676
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:49,360
Whom he stopped?

1677
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,160
"It's me"

1678
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,160
I asked him what's the stuff?

1679
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,120
He asked whether I have papers.

1680
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,440
I asked which daily?

1681
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,840
He asked me whether I have RC book?

1682
01:11:58,880 --> 01:11:59,240
Okay.

1683
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,480
I replied that I'm in Face book
and will he give a friend request?

1684
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,800
He asked whether I know
the privilege of this attire?

1685
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,400
I told him to give it to me.

1686
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,680
so that I wear and check out with others.

1687
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,160
I told it in my style.

1688
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,560
He gave his attire to me
and stands with vest in bus stop.

1689
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,920
You look cute when smiling.

1690
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,800
Go and check the result.

1691
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,200
Come.

1692
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,600
Uncle,why the ambulance comes here?

1693
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,960
I informed to come.

1694
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,760
It's only hitting people so far.

1695
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,840
Hereafter,it's lynching!

1696
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,640
Go and check the result.

1697
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,040
It's the result for everyone today.

1698
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:30,840
Come on.

1699
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,480
Hmm...

1700
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,080
Come on.

1701
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:35,720
Uncle!

1702
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,240
Yes dude,

1703
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,000
I passed the exams.

1704
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,680
Son-in-law passed the exams.

1705
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:40,760
Father and son duo...

1706
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,600
Get a family punch.

1707
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,960
Boss,check whether it's right.

1708
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:44,920
No...

1709
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,200
Uncle,wait a minute.

1710
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,960
Don't control me when in position.

1711
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,880
The initial has changed,Uncle.

1712
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,360
That means?

1713
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,640
I'm failed.

1714
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,920
Can't even get in bail?

1715
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,480
Damn sure,
it's not possible.

1716
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:56,960
Hey stop.

1717
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,600
Hey come...

1718
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,280
Come fast.

1719
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,400
He said he did the exams well.

1720
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,800
Come on.

1721
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,600
We know you'll come here.

1722
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,240
Cramp him.

1723
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,080
You too joined?

1724
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,160
You shouldn't sit at
anywhere hereafter.

1725
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,080
Pour the hot water.

1726
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,680
You made me to work for
your son-in-law.

1727
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,880
It's burning!

1728
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
What to do?

1729
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,200
Leave me.

1730
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,320
I must get into the pond
and cool myself.

1731
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,200
Catch him.
Leave me.

1732
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,640
Don't hit.

1733
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,400
Leave me.

1734
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,600
Don't hit.

1735
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,120
Leave me.

1736
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,520
Just a minute,
 i'll call back.

1737
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,400
Tell me.

1738
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,160
Hey Mathi,where are you?
Tell me.

1739
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,680
Your brother gorged poison.

1740
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:49,280
Hey,what do you say?

1741
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,280
Yes,hurry up to coconut market.

1742
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,360
Get up.

1743
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,360
Arivu,

1744
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,240
get up.

1745
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,520
Hurry up,

1746
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,880
What happened?

1747
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,200
Why did you do it?

1748
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,480
Can't you remember any of the
family members before homicidal?

1749
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,360
Move...

1750
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,880
Didn't you ponder of our parents stance,
if it goes baneful?

1751
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,920
You would've told me whatever it is!

1752
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,040
Why did he do it?

1753
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,560
Your brother's love girl
is getting married tomorrow.

1754
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,800
As he is afraid of talking
to your dad,

1755
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,640
he gorged poison.

1756
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,880
Which hamlet the girl belongs to?

1757
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:21,720
Greetings!

1758
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,120
Rajangam...

1759
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:31,440
Mathi,the bride is the sister
of whom you are in love.

1760
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,440
We are here for the sake of your brother.

1761
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,560
Two of your families were egalitarian.

1762
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,880
But if we abduct this girl,
damn sure your love will be left in perils.

1763
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,000
Mathi,ponder well.

1764
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,600
First,let me prefer my affinity.

1765
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,880
Later,the love of my life.

1766
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,680
It's okay.

1767
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,640
That one!

1768
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:57,840
Who's that?

1769
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,160
The door is locked.

1770
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,480
Who locked it?

1771
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,240
Someone has come with a sickle
to selvarani's room.

1772
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,120
Whatever you said...

1773
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:54,680
Yes.

1774
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,280
Hey,go that side...

1775
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,600
You go this side...

1776
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,440
Mathi,we crossed the temple.

1777
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,440
Turn the vehicle.

1778
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,040
Dude,they didn't go afraid of us,

1779
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,080
They left in search of temple.

1780
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,440
Can't open the door.

1781
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:06,640
Hey no!

1782
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,360
Hey no!

1783
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,640
Don't worry son-in-law.

1784
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,400
What happened?

1785
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,960
Easwari,take that plate.
What?

1786
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,280
What happened?

1787
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:27,200
She left us.

1788
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,280
No...

1789
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,720
Brother-in-law,our relationship
mustn't wane just because she left.

1790
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,440
Both of our families must be
unified as my mother's wish.

1791
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,600
Elayarani,

1792
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:44,920
Come here.

1793
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,760
I promise now,

1794
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,400
My younger sister will
marry your brother.

1795
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,920
Get the plate.

1796
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:03,600
Dad,come near.

1797
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,320
Take it.

1798
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:05,480
Come.

1799
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,600
Everything will be good.

1800
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:29,720
Hello...

1801
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,680
I'm Elayarani's friend speaking.

1802
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,200
Tell me

1803
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,320
Is it sir?

1804
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:16,720
Okay sir.

1805
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,560
Okay sir.
Okay sir.

1806
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,960
Your son and that girl
surrendered in thanjavur SP office.

1807
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,240
You can leave now,sir.

1808
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,200
We'll leave.

1809
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:31,720
I'm leaving.

1810
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,080
Yes sir.

1811
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,520
Whom are you talking about?

1812
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,360
Is it about our boss?

1813
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,800
Get lost.

1814
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,360
Hey, why are you shouting?

1815
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,160
I'll pounce you.

1816
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,440
What's the reason to brawl now?

1817
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,400
Govindaraj mooriyar

1818
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,480
Mediating is to doyens!

1819
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:46,920
Hey

1820
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,040
whom you call by name?

1821
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,280
We'll slay you.

1822
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:49,960
Isn't he Govindaraj mooriyar?

1823
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,480
I'll slay you.

1824
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,680
Who slays whom?

1825
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:53,800
I'll torn you into pieces.

1826
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,280
What are you talking about?

1827
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,040
Stop it.

1828
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,960
Is he having horns?

1829
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,800
I'll hit you hard.

1830
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,320
Stop it.

1831
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,440
Don't breach with them.

1832
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,040
Come on.

1833
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,680
If you are bold enough,talk to us.

1834
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,000
Listen carefully,

1835
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:13,480
We'll seize them both
wherever they may be.

1836
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,800
What are you looking at?

1837
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:18,080
Hey...

1838
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,880
Stay back and talk.

1839
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:23,040
Mooriyar,stay back.

1840
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,080
Stay back and talk.

1841
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,600
Elder guy is better than him.

1842
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,720
Being afraid,
he gorged poison.

1843
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:32,840
But the younger guy

1844
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,200
He abducted selvarani

1845
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,320
And got her married.

1846
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,880
We mustn't leave him idle.

1847
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,880
It's a festival today
in their village.

1848
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,040
The whole village will be at temple.

1849
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,440
Abduct him.

1850
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,120
I'll take care of
whatever is the result.

1851
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:45,800
Ok, brother - in - law

1852
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,080
The auspicious pole can be laid
after six months only.

1853
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,600
Auspicious time for bridegroom.

1854
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,480
Starts after eight months

1855
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:03,440
That's why I say,

1856
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,680
it's possible only after six months.

1857
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,080
Can't we proceed it afore?

1858
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,400
We are blood relatives,

1859
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,840
If there is any remedy
we can rectify that and proceed.

1860
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,720
We mustn't do
the auspicious event on compulsion.

1861
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,080
If we do so?

1862
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,880
I mustn't say it.

1863
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,960
But for your sake I'm telling it.

1864
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,720
If you proceed against it,

1865
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,480
A life will be departed.

1866
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,720
What do you say?

1867
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,520
Yes,if you proceed against it,

1868
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,240
a life will be departed.

1869
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Past,because of our urgency
we are at this stance.

1870
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:35,880
It's good to abide by astrologer.

1871
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,760
Your decision is exactly right, sir.

1872
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,560
If you proceed against it,
a life will be departed.

1873
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,760
We'll go by his words.

1874
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,960
Let the marriage be after
six months or a year.

1875
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,880
I've to discuss an important
subject to you.

1876
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:56,760
Tell me

1877
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,360
None of your family members
should be in touch...

1878
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,040
...with the family of your elder sister.

1879
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,480
I'll lynch Mathi in future

1880
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:10,360
Then it won't be good
if you prefer their relationship.

1881
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,760
if anything happens so.

1882
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,880
I'll send back your younger
sister at the earliest,

1883
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,480
I would've told you on the day
of engagement,

1884
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,560
But I curb my tongue
as it's not decency.

1885
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:27,240
I promise you that even
my dog won't go there.

1886
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,680
If you don't have faith,

1887
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,040
I'll make a promise in front of family deity.

1888
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,000
Your word is enough to me.

1889
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,520
Bala speaking,

1890
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,320
Where are you?

1891
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,200
We are in hospital.

1892
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,080
What happened?

1893
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:47,080
Priya, a missed girl is at the audio room.

1894
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,840
We request her parents to come here.

1895
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,720
Again I repeat...

1896
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,320
He must know the reflex
if he intrude in JP family.

1897
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,640
If he is brother-in-law of JP,
is he a big doyen?

1898
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,800
I'll pounce him if I see him today.

1899
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,560
How dare he yells at dad?

1900
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,040
What you say is right.

1901
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:04,160
They may entrap to your anger.

1902
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:04,800
What?

1903
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,280
Look at there.

1904
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,360
Search everywhere.

1905
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,400
Tamarind sack, give me your cloth,

1906
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,840
We'll enjoy it today.
He shouldn't be missed.

1907
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,600
It's true that god is there.

1908
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:13,720
What do you want?

1909
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:14,760
Announce this.

1910
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,160
You leave,I'll read it.

1911
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,240
The JP clan searching for Mathi,

1912
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,040
Don't go anywhere.

1913
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,160
Come near to the pond at the temple.

1914
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,560
Mathi is waiting for you.

1915
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:29,920
Don't oversee right and left

1916
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:30,680
Come soon.

1917
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,560
Come on.

1918
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,400
He must breathe his last today.

1919
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,320
Uncle, he is afraid as you
yelled at his father.

1920
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,920
He signals you to go aside.

1921
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,360
You be aside,
I'll breach at him.

1922
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,080
Hey...

1923
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,760
Hey, what are you thinking about?

1924
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,200
You arretsed the one who were beaten
but left the one who hit them.

1925
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,000
Come with me.

1926
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,760
Hey,sit down.

1927
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:46,560
Hey

1928
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:47,680
On that day

1929
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:50,840
You created ruckus in police station
for the marriage of some other girl.

1930
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,160
Now,he abducted your sister.

1931
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,960
If you are bold enough,hold his shirt.

1932
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,720
Hey,what do you blabber?

1933
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,800
Dude,we'll leave.
We'll leave.

1934
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:05,800
At this situation
the police will only support him.

1935
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,080
Look after the  marriage works,
I'll lynch Mathi.

1936
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:11,320
Come.

1937
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,680
Listen to me.

1938
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,600
Your countenance must be pityful.

1939
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,560
You too brother.

1940
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,960
I'll go home earlier

1941
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,400
By the time you come

1942
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,240
I'll enact the play before dad.

1943
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,040
How?

1944
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,040
Are you a elder son?

1945
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,400
You must chide me if I'm at fault.

1946
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,720
But you do everything.

1947
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,600
Rogue.
Rogue.

1948
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,360
You can chide me straight away
if you wish.

1949
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:36,720
It's my performance before dad
for your goodness.

1950
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,760
Ever our family even went
by the side of police station?

1951
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,280
But you made
our dad to go to police station.

1952
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:43,360
Are you human?

1953
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,360
You gorged toxicant...

1954
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,240
Don't want to tell that incident.

1955
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,200
Mom and aunt will cry.

1956
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,120
It's a matter of sentiment.

1957
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,240
It'll work.
Listen to me.

1958
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,480
Do parents bear
if anything happens to you?

1959
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,000
Do I bear if parents suffer?

1960
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,640
Do family bear if I suffer?

1961
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,560
Without any knowledge of this,
you got married!

1962
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,080
Get lost, dog.

1963
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,360
Dog!

1964
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,920
I'll yell at you in this manner.

1965
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,360
Immediately dad will say that,

1966
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,240
Shut your mouth

1967
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,280
You dare to yell
at elder brother without respect.

1968
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,720
My child,you get in as couple.

1969
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:18,040
He will ask you to get in.

1970
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,600
You imitate as dad.

1971
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,560
I know his attitude

1972
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,080
As well as his voice.

1973
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,040
I'll go.

1974
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:24,640
Come,we'll go.

1975
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,600
Come little bit late.

1976
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,080
Why?

1977
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,760
It must be a live performance
though scripted.

1978
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,000
First, I'll get ready.

1979
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,760
How did you select him?

1980
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,920
Hope all his notion may work out.

1981
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:36,880
Brother.

1982
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:37,640
Brother.

1983
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,560
Hey, stop there.

1984
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,440
How dare you come here?

1985
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,400
Do you know,his name
was spoiled because of you?

1986
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,160
Are you a elder brother?

1987
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,240
Do you know the stance
of elder brother?

1988
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,120
Half part of dad and
other half of mom!

1989
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,400
Good dialogue

1990
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,200
Aren't you ashamed to be here?

1991
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,160
Get lost.

1992
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,920
What do you say?

1993
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,520
Dad, is it right?

1994
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,080
Yes, perfectly right.

1995
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:03,720
Dad!

1996
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:07,200
Go out.

1997
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:07,680
Go...

1998
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:08,960
What do you say?

1999
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,280
Born in this family, he ditched us.

2000
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,000
Gorged poison.

2001
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,240
Go...

2002
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,600
Brother, he is pityful.

2003
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:18,560
If anyone converse more than this,

2004
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,440
I'll go out of this house.

2005
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,120
He told.

2006
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:22,520
Go out.

2007
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,240
Mathi!

2008
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,600
what do you blabber?

2009
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,120
Go...
Go...

2010
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,400
He goes out.

2011
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,080
Boss,a small hint.

2012
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,160
Hey,shut up you mocker.

2013
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,160
Dare to hint out to me.

2014
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,880
Go away.
Go away.

2015
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,640
Go aside.

2016
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,960
Feed the cow at the backyard.

2017
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:40,800
Where do you go?

2018
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:41,800
Is the cow inside the house?

2019
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,600
Go at the back.

2020
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,440
Get her in.

2021
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,240
Come sister.

2022
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,120
Dude, get in.

2023
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,480
I'll take care. Go

2024
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,120
It happened contrary to my plan.

2025
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:07,960
I must manage somehow.

2026
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,280
Boss!

2027
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,240
It's known now,
why the cow yields less quantity of milk.

2028
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:26,520
Stop.

2029
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:27,440
Why to stop?

2030
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:27,880
Please stop.

2031
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:28,720
Listen to me.

2032
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,120
It's good performance.

2033
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,800
You planned well and sent us out.

2034
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,560
Can't you understand?

2035
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:34,480
What I must understand?

2036
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,880
When dad was talking,
can't you say that it's all your plan?

2037
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,120
For what?
To send me out?

2038
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,280
I can unify you only
if I stay in house.

2039
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,520
I didn't expect dad's words.

2040
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:48,680
Mathi

2041
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,840
I'm worried to stay alone without you all.

2042
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,240
Don't worry.

2043
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,520
Everything happens for good.

2044
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,040
If you are unified in our house,

2045
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,840
Her household would've been insane.

2046
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,080
If you are unified on her house

2047
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,880
Our parents may resent.

2048
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,640
It's the exact situation

2049
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,600
To create a pity on you

2050
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,000
So that you'll be unified
soon with families.

2051
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:07,600
What Mathi says is right.

2052
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:12,000
I've arranged for your stay
in my friend's house.

2053
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,280
Be here.i'll come with the keys.

2054
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,040
Will you come soon?

2055
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,040
I'll come.

2056
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,000
I must set right my brother's life.

2057
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,560
You'll never change.

2058
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,120
I know how to handle you.

2059
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,000
At the family situation,
you use foul words.

2060
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,400
I said it's money.

2061
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,080
No...

2062
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:42,760
Tell us something.

2063
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:45,600
Why do you keep silent?

2064
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,560
Hey Elayarani,
We can know only if you tell,

2065
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,640
Tell us.

2066
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,680
Hey

2067
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:05,200
Go and talk to him.

2068
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:06,040
Talk to him.

2069
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,760
What's the subject Mathi?

2070
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,440
I came to meet you.

2071
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,320
What's the use of meeting?

2072
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:36,200
My family decided to correct
the fault happened at my sister's marriage.

2073
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,520
So engaged me for marriage.

2074
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:43,400
You tell what I must do now?

2075
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,920
Erstwhile,in marriage hall,

2076
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:59,640
It's good if you've got me also
along with my sister.

2077
01:35:59,680 --> 01:35:59,720
It's good if you've got me also
along with my sister.

2078
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:14,000
Nothing is going to happen.

2079
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:19,160
I'm confident that we'll be together.

2080
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,880
I don't have even a bit of confidence.

2081
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,240
It's disheartening to both of us
if you come here.

2082
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,520
Don't come here Mathi.

2083
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,960
"Who is that personage?"

2084
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,600
Who bequeath to?

2085
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,680
"The wounds which never heals,"

2086
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,240
"Who is that personage?"

2087
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,760
"Who need to tell? "

2088
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:54,440
"The solution to heal the wounds. "

2089
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:59,080
Mathi, when you have time
please come to meet us.

2090
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:02,120
You are the only relation to us.

2091
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:05,680
"Will it amend?
Or will it go contrary?"

2092
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:10,200
"The fate plays a ploy now,"

2093
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,080
"Who is that personage?"

2094
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:15,800
"Who bequeath to?"

2095
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:20,520
"The wounds which never heal."

2096
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:23,200
"Who is that personage?"

2097
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,720
"Who need to tell? "

2098
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:30,560
'The solution to heal the wounds. "

2099
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:41,200
"There is no moon without barrier"

2100
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:46,480
"There'll be no relationships if faults are thick,"

2101
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:51,480
"Relationships are the soul,"

2102
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:56,560
"Moulded with blood,"

2103
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:04,360
"It'll emerge even if something
happens to you,"

2104
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,800
"Who is that personage?"

2105
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,280
"Who bequeath to?"

2106
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:14,200
"The wounds which never heals,"

2107
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,320
"The relationships are far-flung,"

2108
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,000
"The eyes are wet,"

2109
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,440
"Will it amend?

2110
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,240
Or will it go contrary?"

2111
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:30,200
"The fate plays a ploy now."

2112
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:33,040
Dad!

2113
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,760
No...
No...

2114
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:38,640
Hey what happened?

2115
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,600
We killed brother on our own.

2116
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,840
We killed him.

2117
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,480
What do you say?

2118
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,120
They both met with accident.

2119
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,520
When?
Where?

2120
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:50,480
They are in hospital.

2121
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,480
Raja

2122
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,080
Brother,

2123
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:52,680
Raja, come soon.

2124
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,720
Take the vehicle.

2125
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:58,720
Kalaiyarasi, here.

2126
01:38:58,720 --> 01:38:59,440
What happened?
Ask him please.

2127
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,240
I'm sorry.

2128
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,160
We can't help.
deported to house

2129
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,840
Raja, what the doctor says?

2130
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,760
What to do now?

2131
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:13,040
We thought you'll take care of them.
You failed.

2132
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,040
It's my mistake.

2133
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,840
I pushed them out of the house.

2134
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,560
What to do now?

2135
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,960
What's the use of emotions now?

2136
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,240
Come,let's see their countenance at final.

2137
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:28,400
I must see her.

2138
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,880
I must see my daughter.

2139
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,880
Where is the keys?

2140
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:35,400
I kept the keys somewhere.

2141
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,080
Get into our vehicle.

2142
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:39,440
Come

2143
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,640
Selvarani!

2144
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,520
Isn't it good to send all
in a single vehicle?

2145
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,280
Selvarani!

2146
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:56,720
Mom!

2147
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,480
Are you well?

2148
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:00,360
Yes dad.

2149
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,000
We were informed that you are dead.

2150
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,040
Will you come to see me only if I'm dead?

2151
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,560
What do you say?

2152
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,520
You spent all this days without me!

2153
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:10,720
Why you did so?

2154
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:13,560
Hey,arivu!

2155
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,920
Dad,forgive me.

2156
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,000
What happened to you?

2157
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,760
What happened?

2158
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:17,520
Nothing to me

2159
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:19,720
I'm breathing now only.

2160
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,400
Nothing to me mom.

2161
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,360
We got an information that
you met with an accident.

2162
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,520
That is...

2163
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,080
It's not accident boss,

2164
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,080
It's our plan.

2165
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,680
Scoundrel

2166
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,080
Don't you know what to play with?

2167
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,000
We were horrified!

2168
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,280
Nothing serious to you, right?

2169
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:39,240
Witnessing the hardships of all of us,
Mathi planned it to unify us.

2170
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,600
You would've told it afore he slapped me.

2171
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,200
How do I know that he'll slap?

2172
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:44,240
You look fair,

2173
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,520
Hey, be quite.

2174
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,360
but don't know anything...

2175
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:47,640
Come

2176
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,280
Mathi, come.
Come.

2177
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,200
You cheated us by enacting a drama.

2178
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,880
Today is the day you did
something good.

2179
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,000
Don't cry.
They are well and good.

2180
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,440
Be careful.

2181
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,480
Son, get blessings from your in-laws.

2182
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,560
Bless you.

2183
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,000
Aunt

2184
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,440
Hmm

2185
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:10,840
Take it.
No...

2186
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,480
Hey, don't refrain their money.

2187
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,600
Take it son-in-law.

2188
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,440
Ammu, I'll get coffee.

2189
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,160
We are happy.

2190
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:20,080
You mean "Ammu?"
Yes,brother calls her as "Ammu."

2191
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,080
Ammu,Do get coffee to all...

2192
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,920
The same way I'll call my wife as Gummu...

2193
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:28,680
Aah!

2194
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:29,640
Yes

2195
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:38,600
They got the coffee.

2196
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:39,120
Give it.

2197
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:41,160
An important stuff,

2198
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,160
I didn't even seek permission
from my husband

2199
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:46,840
We'll get our son and daughter-in-law
to our house.

2200
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,560
We'll get them along with us.

2201
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,560
We are panic about our elder son.

2202
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:53,760
We can't even do baby shower for her.

2203
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:54,920
Why do you worry?

2204
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:55,840
She is our daughter.

2205
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:56,200
Yes.

2206
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,920
We'll do baby shower.

2207
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,000
We'll inform you for an auspicious day,

2208
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:00,840
You all should come.

2209
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,520
All of you must come.

2210
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,120
Have to think of my elder son's reaction.

2211
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:06,760
We'll try to come.

2212
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,520
Why do you hesitate when we invite you?

2213
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,640
You must come.

2214
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,320
All of you...

2215
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,880
You all must come.

2216
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,200

01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,320
Yes.

2218
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:17,960
I'm very happy.

2219
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,080
You saved me
when I gorged the poison.

2220
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:23,520
You helped me to
marry the girl whom I loved.

2221
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,120
You unified our families too.

2222
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,240
As an elder I must do you all,

2223
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,200
but though younger
you did me everything.

2224
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,240
You are my brother.

2225
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,200
Talking to me as if I'm a neighbour.

2226
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:35,840
Only wish to me is

2227
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,000
if a boy is born,
we'll call him by our dad's name.

2228
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,320
If it's a girl,
we'll call by our mom's name.

2229
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:45,040
Arivu...

2230
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:46,200
Mathi...

2231
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:57,880
Come

2232
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:00,760
That side.

2233
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,120
Catch him.

2234
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,000
Hurry up.

2235
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:11,760
Lynch him

2236
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,520
I'll lynch him.
Damn sure.

2237
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,080
If not,i'll mock his head and
make him wander as mad.

2238
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,160
Call me after it's done.

2239
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:26,360
You get caught.

2240
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,440
Lynch him.

2241
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,640
Come on.

2242
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,840
If ten persons hold sickle in your hamlet,

2243
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:22,760
Each and everyone holds sickle here.

2244
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,840
You must have a mark of coming.

2245
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,040
Are you worried about me
when I'm in hospital?

2246
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:53,320
I know you'll be fine.

2247
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,200
You know I'm fine!

2248
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,760
Why do you outburst in anger now?

2249
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:57,600
Am I idle in house?

2250
01:44:57,640 --> 01:44:59,360
What's the hectic work you had?

2251
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,240
Tell me ramesh...

2252
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:02,960
Stop the vehicle.

2253
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:04,920
Yes ramesh.

2254
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:06,840
You mean,I...

No...

2257
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,800
We are in travelling.

2258
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,800
What would've he asked?

2259
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,280
Okay ramesh, I'm busy right now.

2260
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,000
I'll call you tonight.

2261
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:30,640
Who is ramesh?

2262
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:31,760
You don't know.

2263
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,880
To know only I'm asking.

2264
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,800
Tell me.

2265
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,560
What'll you do by knowing?

2266
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:37,840
What?

2267
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,920
She enjoys the number!

2268
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:42,960
Tell me suresh.

2269
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,160
Myself, my husband Durai...

2270
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:50,440
Whom you mention is
Thangadurai, slim and tall.

2271
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,520
No, the short one is Thambidurai.

2272
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,240
He is bulky and plump.

2273
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,840
His name is Attackdurai.

2274
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,120
It's now the name is in sync to me

2275
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,880
I'll call back, Suresh.

2276
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:10,880
Who is this Suresh?

2277
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:11,960
Friend of Ramesh.

2278
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,000
You are yet to say who is Ramesh?

2279
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:15,880
What do you want now?

2280
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,600
You must know who is Ramesh?
Isn't it?

2281
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,160
Hey, switch on the speaker.

2282
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,840
Is it a festive to switch on the speaker?

2283
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:26,920
Tell me Madhesh.

2284
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:27,800
Next?

2285
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:30,480
In trichy?

2286
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320
In white attire?

2287
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,160
Is it at the entrance of
kalaiarangam theatre?

2288
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,680
Are you waiting?

2289
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:40,720
Tell me that first.

2290
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,920
My heart pains.

2291
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,480
Sir, is she your second wife?

2292
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:47,000
Not even a second she was my wife.

2293
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:47,600
I expected it.

2294
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,600
What did you tell the driver now?

2295
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:50,160
What?

2296
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:53,080
Now you want to know who is Madhesh?
Isn't it?

2297
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:54,240
I don't want to know.

2298
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,440
So,you are doubtful on me?

2299
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:56,560
It's confirmed long back

2300
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,800
Do you know about me?

2301
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:58,880
Do you know,buffalo?

2302
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,200
She decided to leave.

2303
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,080
Listen to me.

2304
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:01,480
Tell me

2305
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:09,000
Ramesh, Suresh, Madhesh
I call them all as brothers at day.

2306
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:09,720
What about at night?

2307
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,400
I'll sleep at nights.

2308
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:15,240
Hey how innocent performance of her!
I'll slay her.

2309
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:16,960
Did she left?

2310
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,400
Vignesh.
All goes behind her

2311
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:19,480
Someone come this side.

2312
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,640
Tell me,

2313
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:23,960
Tomorrow morning is the "Baby shower."

2314
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:26,600
We know, that's why
we are preparing sweets.

2315
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,800
You called in between.

2316
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,240
All must come tomorrow.

2317
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,360
Damn sure we'll come.

2318
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:30,960
Okay aunty,

2319
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:38,840
My daughter's favourite
Snacks and sweets...

2320
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,480
Someone knocks the door.

2321
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,360
Don't know who it is?

2322
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:43,280
Open it aunt.

2323
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,680
Who?

2324
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,360
My daughter likes Jhangri.

2325
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,920
Whatever it is,come inside and tell.

2326
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:56,640
Easwari,come here.

2327
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,880
My daughter likes Jhangri.

2328
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,560
You told it then.

2329
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,120
You only told me to say inside.

2330
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,880
Is it a problem now?

2331
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,520
We must do all the items before dawn.

2332
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,480
Everything is okay,
but how'll you leave in the morning?

2333
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,760
Do the favourite breakfast of my son.

2334
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,240
We'll leave without any doubt.

2335
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,720
When he goes that way,
we'll go in our way.

2336
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:16,800
Superb aunt!

2337
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,880
God must be with us.

2338
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,440
What about the in-laws?

2339
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,280
I'm calling them now.

2340
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:23,200
Find out whether they left?

2341
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:23,800
Find out whether they left?

2342
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,560
Welcome... welcome...

2343
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,360
Tell me,

2344
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,560
Grandma, have you started?

2345
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:31,080
My grandson is yet to leave.

2346
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,120
We'll start as soon as he leaves.

2347
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,200
Come soon grandma.

2348
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,880
Yes, we'll come...come...

2349
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:37,480
Go and dine.

2350
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,040
Aunt, here is the chutnety.

2351
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:44,080
No,it's salty.

2352
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,920
I put just a little.

2353
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:47,040
You put it?

2354
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,160
You too added?

2355
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,640
No...

2356
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,240
What to do now?

2357
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,520
He'll throw on our face.

2358
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,360
You are working without
adept to the situation.

2359
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,480
He is your son,
You go to serve him.

2360
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,080
I forgot to tell you at your marriage.

2361
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,880
You must serve your husband.
I'll serve to my husband.

2362
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,960
Oh good! Most of the
time you own him so adamantly.

2363
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:05,640
Okay, I won't utter from today,

2364
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:06,080
Go now

2365
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,000
Come

2366
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:09,800
Serve him.

2367
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:10,880
For me too.

2368
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,480
Taste of salt is perfect in chutney.

2369
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:22,680
Why it's very much salty?

2370
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,280
Not at all.

2371
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:24,480
It's right.

2372
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,280
Tastes good today.

2373
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,680
Is it?
Have some more.

2374
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,840
Oh my god!

2375
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:32,640
You are going out,

2376
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:33,840
When you'll be back?

2377
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,440
I'm going to PWD on the matter of contract.

2378
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,360
Let it be,
When you'll be back?

2379
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,480
I know only when I go there.

2380
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,760
Will you come for lunch?

2381
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,560
I'm yet to leave,

2382
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,520
But asking when I'll be back?

2383
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,880
Why do you resent?

2384
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:54,440
As you go out, tell them
at what time you'll be back.

2385
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,760
What dad,you too talk without understanding?

2386
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,440
Why do you resent to dad?

2387
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:06,400
Tell clearly whether
you come for lunch or not?or for dinner?

2388
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,640
Why a new affection today?

2389
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,520
Each of you inquire when I'll be back?

2390
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,680
Responsibility! It's responsibility.
When you'll be back.

2391
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:17,920
I'll come,
As soon as possible.

2392
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,960
You leave without having food.

2393
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:23,880
You don't know to prepare the chutney,
Responsibility emerges.

2394
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:24,800
Ask them well.

2395
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,920
He left.

2396
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,840
We'll hurry up.
Go go

2397
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:36,000
Keep it fast.

2398
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:37,680
Tell them to hurry up.

2399
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:38,480
Yes,they are coming.

2400
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:39,720
It's getting late.

2401
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,520
We are coming there.

2402
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,320
Is everything here?
Yes, it is.

2403
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,040
Come fast.

2404
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,760
Who is that in phone?
Younger son-in-law

2405
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:45,600
Come, let's go.

2406
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,040
God save us!

2407
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,680
Easwari,look for the good sign
as we go for auspicious function.

2408
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:56,640
Yes aunt.

2409
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:03,840
Oh no, aunt!

2410
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:04,640
What happened?

2411
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,440
My husband's vehicle is coming.

2412
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:07,560
No.

2413
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:10,880
Why does he come back?
Don't know what's the stuff?

2414
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,560
You call him and ask.

2415
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,640
I'll smash your head,
not bothered as my mother.

2416
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,320
You can smash her head later,
Get in first.

2417
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:17,120
Wait i'll come.

2418
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:18,600
What are you doing?

2419
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:19,440
I'm taking away the coconut pieces.

2420
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:20,840
It's okay.
Leave it. It'll be known.

2421
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:25,000
We must manage. Come in.
We'll get caught. Leave it.Hey, get in.

2422
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,800
What?
Yes.

2423
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:30,160
Wait,don't close.
What happened?

2424
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:33,720
At this crucial time, your wife needs sweet.
It's not for me. It's for you.

2425
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,320
Don't open your mouth.

2426
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:39,480
He has come.
Get in, Be careful.

2427
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,600
Broken the coconut!

2428
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:51,640
He'll splash!
Sit at each corner.

2429
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:55,280
Phone...
It's very important. Phone!

2430
01:51:58,760 --> 01:51:59,560
1

2431
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,440
Where is the saree?
-Here it is.

2432
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:03,600
Okay!
-How is it?

2433
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,040
The A.E is twisting to dawn and dusk,

2434
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,840
I called his home but it's unattended.

2435
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,880
Is the whole family enacting a drama?

2436
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,800
Bloody thieves.

2437
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:16,320
Why are you back so soon?

2438
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:17,200
Where did i come?

2439
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,120
I'm back to home, isn't it?

2440
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,960
She is asking that you are back soon.

2441
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,280
As A.E is late today,
they told me to come by noon.

2442
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,080
Why do wear necklace on the nighty?

2443
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,320
Fear of theft.

2444
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,280
Yes, isn't it aunt?
Yes.

2445
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,040
Let it be. Why coconut is broken outside?

2446
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,920
It might have fallen from the tree.

2447
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,200
Will it fall down as sheared?
Didn't I tell you?

2448
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:43,480
Nowadays,who knows what falls and how?

2449
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,840
If we look at it,what about other works?

2450
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,560
Mom, why did you change the dress so soon?
Are you going out?

2451
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:53,000
It's me,who told aunty to go to temple.
Isn't it?

2452
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,120
Goddess Mariamman!
So yellow colored saree

2453
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:57,120
You can go now.

2454
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:58,760
Tell him.

2455
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:02,560
As it seems to rain, we are waiting.

2456
01:53:06,160 --> 01:53:08,160
Why dad is sleeping with coolers?

2457
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:14,400
It's hot sun. As he felt
his eyes are itching, He sleeps with the coolers.

2458
01:53:14,440 --> 01:53:17,080
What's that tales are you telling?

2459
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,920
What grandma,
sitting like a lizard on the wall?

2460
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:23,440
Did anyone yell at you?

2461
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:25,160
Don't be afraid.
Tell me.

2462
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,040
Open your mouth and tell.

2463
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,360
Have you stuffed anything in your mouth?

2464
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:31,120
Swallow it.

2465
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,080
Not yourself and your countenance is good.

2466
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:48,000
(Phone rings)

2467
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,200
Mom.

2468
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,920
Do that ring tone adheres to your age?

2469
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:04,040
No.
Take it. Oh!

2470
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,760
Easwari,

2471
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:10,640
I can't take it because of hip pain.

2472
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:11,400
Who calls you?

2473
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,760
Are you searching or dancing?

2474
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:15,280
It's down,take it

2475
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:24,640
Give it.
Hello,

2476
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,000
Grandma,have you started?

2477
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,080
Are you veterinary doctor?

2478
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:31,440
Will you check only chicken or even crane?

2479
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,240
Tell me now.
Tell me.

2480
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,200
Why didn't you all come yet?

2481
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,840
My grandson is back to home

2482
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:39,480
When you'll leave then?

2483
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:40,560
Don't know that

2484
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,240
Easwari...
Yes, coming.

2485
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,080
He removed his shirt.

2486
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,320
Switched on the tv

2487
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:54,600
Grandma, your performance must exceed
the real actor on the notion I give you now. Yes.

2488
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:01,160
I got chest pain

2489
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:06,640
Kalaiyarasi,I got chest pain.

2490
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:08,960
My beloved daughter-in-law, come soon

2491
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,200
Aunt! What happened to you?

2492
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,680
What happened?

2493
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,120
Chest pain.

2494
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,160
Oh!

2495
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:21,440
Aunt has got chest pain.

2496
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,000
Come soon.

2497
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,040
What happened?

2498
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:26,160
Grandma has got chest pain

2499
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:27,280
Is it?

2500
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:29,720
Yes.
No...Hubby!

2501
01:55:30,160 --> 01:55:32,400
Why do you call him?
Shouldn't I call him?

2502
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,080
No...

2503
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:34,440
No.

2504
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:35,560
My mother!

2505
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:36,760
Get in.

2506
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,960
Open the door.

2507
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:44,480
Not that,
This door.

2508
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,960
Is it vigorous, grandma?
Yes.

2509
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,160
Which doctor are you going to consult?

2510
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:49,080
"Dr.Balakrishnan."

2511
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,480
Which Balakrishnan?

2512
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,240
Dark and stout person.

2513
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,480
The doctor who killed your grandfather.

2514
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:57,680
It's routine for him.

2515
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:58,800
Oh no...

2516
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:00,280
He escaped on the day of grandfather's death

2517
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,080
If anything goes wrong now,

2518
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:06,440
I'll shoot him.
What?

2519
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:08,600
Where are you going now?

2520
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,000
To get the gun.

2521
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:12,880
Gun?

2522
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,280
He goes there...

2523
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:16,560
Here...

2524
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,040
Again he goes there

2525
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:21,240
He checks the bullets

2526
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,520
We'll rush.

2527
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,920
Left me.
She is a nuisance.

2528
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:26,200
My head!

2529
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:29,240
No...my head.

2530
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,320
Rajangam, get me too.

2531
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,240
They are coming.

2532
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,760
I told you know,
In-laws only.

2533
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,080
Yes.

2534
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:44,760
Welcome...Welcome...
Welcome...

2535
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:48,040
Welcome...

2536
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:00,360
Welcome kinsfolk!

2537
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:01,360
We have been late.

2538
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,600
Is the auspicious moment crossed over?

2539
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,840
Nothing like that.

2540
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,000
The moment when we
all be together is auspicious for us.

2541
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:09,560
It became a huge task to
manage my grandson.

2542
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,520
We picked her up from college too

2543
01:57:12,760 --> 01:57:14,520
We are afraid that you may not come.

2544
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:14,920
1

2545
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,160
Where did the younger son-in-law leave us?

2546
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:21,000
He was calling all in the family from yesterday.

2547
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,880
He doesn't know my
younger daughter's contact number.

2548
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,120
If not, he would've called her also.

2549
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,760
Why are you standing here?
Come in. Come.

2550
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:38,960
A good example for the joint family!

2551
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,520
How happy they are!

2552
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:42,480
I'm also from a joint family.

2553
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,440
Is it?

2554
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:44,120
Yes!

2555
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:47,600
That's why I'm so happy.

2556
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,280
Who are all with you in the family?

2557
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:50,480
It's me and my wife.

2558
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:52,600
Parents of my wife.

2559
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,920
Brothers of my wife.

2560
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:57,160
Sisters of my wife.

2561
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:59,280
Their Children.

2562
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:02,440
And my sister-in-law,

2563
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:03,920
All stay with me.

2564
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,320
Do you know about of joint family?

2565
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:09,120
Are you making fun of me?
Just now I told you in detail.

2566
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:10,720
Are you a single person?

2567
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,320
I'll tell you what's joint family.

2568
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:16,720
If you build a house on your own,

2569
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,000
And be with your parents,

2570
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,840
brothers and sisters,

2571
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:27,040
and making them to be happy
all along is the joint family.

2572
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:32,080
Doesn't mean as joint family
if you join an already existing family.

2573
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:36,320
Simply teasing elders and sisters-in-law there.

2574
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,920
Everything has been well and good

2575
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:39,960
What? Is it teasing of sister-in-law?

2576
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:40,960
You are funny.

2577
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:41,880
I'm telling you seriously.

2578
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:47,560
Not only joint family,
How a family should be is shown now, watch it.

2579
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:48,800
Whom do you mention?

2580
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:14,120
"Colorful bangles,"

2581
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:17,240
"Begets melody in cute hands,"

2582
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,440
"Bless her..."

2583
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:23,280
"Lustrous gold bangles,"

2584
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:26,240
"Shines in hands,"

2585
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:28,840
"Mount the bangles,"

2586
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,000
"Recite him lily-white
words into his ears, "

2587
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,400
"The tot heeds to will string to it,"

2588
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:38,280
"A new dawn,on the earth,"

2589
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:41,000
"Within petty days,
the tot will smirk at you, "

2590
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:47,000
"A melody lullaby will devour in castle,"

2591
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,920
"The entire region will collogue
about your son,"

2592
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:56,680
"The entire kinship will enjoin
about your son,"

2593
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:10,960
"Colorful bangles,"

2594
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,080
"Begets melody in cute hands,"

2595
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,240
"Bless her..."

2596
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,120
"Lustrous gold bangles,"

2597
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:23,040
"Shines in hands,"

2598
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:25,640
"Mount the bangles,"

2599
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:28,840
"The tot will bounce and bounce,
and will hit on my chest,"

2600
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:31,920
"He'll hug me with his lilliput hands,"

2601
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:35,120
"The entire kinship unifies at the moment,"

2602
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:38,160
"The cub of the lion arrives
to bind us together,"

2603
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:44,160
"A melody lullaby will devour in castle,"

2604
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:50,080
"The entire region will collogue
about your son,"

2605
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:53,840
"The entire kinship will enjoin
about your son,"

2606
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:14,080
Do we have difference in  community or status?

2607
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,520
Why didn't any of your relatives has come?

2608
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,880
Your elder son also didn't come.

2609
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,040
We would've been happy if he has come

2610
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:25,960
Not that, my son is against this marriage.

2611
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,120
We planned our elder daughter's marriage
with my nephew.

2612
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:31,240
That's why.

2613
02:01:33,680 --> 02:01:36,920
My husband and my brother
were childhood friends.

2614
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:40,080
As they want that relationship intact,

2615
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,720
They got married in both households.

2616
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:46,520
After five years,
my sister-in-law committed suicide.

2617
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,000
I lodged a police complaint
against him thinking

2618
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,000
that he must have tortured
my sister and killed her.

2619
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,360
Police filed a case and
imprisoned him for more than a year.

2620
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,360
Later on,I was known that it's not the fault
of my brother-in-law

2621
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,800
but my sister's

2622
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:09,440
The moment we realised our mistake

2623
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:11,320
we went to him to ask for forgiveness.

2624
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,520
But he was not willing to see us.

2625
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,160
So we planned to fix a match to
his son and my daughter,

2626
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:20,240
But afore this marriage happened.

2627
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,720
Now we have engaged
our younger daughter to my nephew.

2628
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:27,760
She is going to be the
bridge to our affinity.

2629
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:30,360
Don't cry.

2630
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:31,280
Then what?

2631
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:34,040
My brother's house is merely
a distance of 12km.

2632
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:37,160
I haven't seen his countenance
for past 32 years.

2633
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:41,400
Tears roll on when there is an emotional support.

2634
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:43,480
You are also like my brother.

2635
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:48,360
The marriage will happen in a good way.

2636
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:54,120
Not only your both families,
we all three together will do this marriage.

2637
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:58,080
Wipe your tears,don't cry.

2638
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:02,640
Hi uncle,had food?

2639
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:04,120
Dumped my belly.

2640
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,200
Didn't you leave?

2641
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,400
To where?

2642
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:07,200
To house.

2643
02:03:07,200 --> 02:03:07,760
Why?

2644
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:09,160
What do you say?

2645
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,160
What dude?

2646
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,520
Only part one of Bahubali was over.

2647
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:12,960
Aah!

2648
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,520
Second group of Bahubali is in search of me.

2649
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:15,880
Oh!

2650
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:17,320
Kattapa is on anger,

2651
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:18,560
He'll mutilate me if get caught.

2652
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:21,000
That's why didn't go to home
and roaming around.

2653
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,240
What'll you do then?

2654
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:24,560
Dude,they didn't go afraid of us,

2655
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:27,760
In my absence, they went to
younger aunt's house.

2656
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:29,880
As usual she was escaped.

2657
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:32,920
Then they turned to elder aunt's house.

2658
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,960
They asked me as soon as
they entered.

2659
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:37,560
Hmm.

2660
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,120
She replied that I went out.

2661
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:40,720
Hmm.

2662
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:42,360
They asked when I'll be back.

2663
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:44,400
She said it's known only when he comes.

2664
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:44,800
Is it?

2665
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:48,040
They said to stay back till I come.

2666
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:55,440
The beer they bought is in our fridge.

2667
02:03:56,440 --> 02:04:00,560
They ordered for egg omelettes
before the beer gets chilled.

2668
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:02,720
Does she works in a restaurant?

2669
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:03,200
No.

2670
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:08,760
Someone in that clan asked
for pepper in the omelette.

2671
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,480
She stared at them.

2672
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:16,760
He threatened her.

2673
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,360
Oh!

2674
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:21,720
She borrowed spices to use to their taste.

2675
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:25,520
She gave more than they asked for.

2676
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:27,480
Don't they have that gratitude?

2677
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:28,560
Yes.

2678
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,280
After their enjoyment they must have left.

2679
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:37,880
But someone asked her to dance.

2680
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:38,640
Hmm.

2681
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:41,160
She stared at them.

2682
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:41,720
Why?

2683
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:45,360
They tortoured her to dance.

2684
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,080
She manage her best to be a wife.

2685
02:04:49,480 --> 02:04:52,360
They compelled her to dance.

2686
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,520
Younger aunt is actor vijay's fan.

2687
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,800
So she would've managed
with a couple of steps.

2688
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,680
But elder aunt is actor Rajkiran's fan.

2689
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,600
She can't dance at all.

2690
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:10,640
She doesn't know to dance then?

2691
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,280
No...

2692
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:17,080
You simply ask as if
she doesn't know to cook?

2693
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,360
She is a family woman.

2694
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,720
You ask as if she is a slander.

2695
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:28,400
Dude, will you pass in next
attempt of your exam?

2696
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:29,240
Hmm.

2697
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:30,640
Don't ponder, dude.

2698
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:33,320
Your aunt's life will pass on
by preparing omelettes.

2699
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:34,200
No uncle.

2700
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:38,080
What I think is that it's good
to send aunt to dance class.

2701
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:39,880
It's foolish to tell you my story.

2702
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:41,800
They are far better than you.

2703
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:45,000
I'll save my wife by apology to Kattappa.

2704
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:45,760
Uncle,

2705
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:46,400
What?

2706
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:46,920
Exams.

2707
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:47,680
Get lost.

2708
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,720
You mulled me with it.

2709
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,400
Kattappa, where are you?

2710
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,000
I'm coming...

2711
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,720
Easwari, come here.

2712
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,120
What happened?

2713
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:08,560
Will you eat something?

2714
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,840
Why did you slap her?

2715
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:11,600
What happened?

2716
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:13,520
I left her not killing.

2717
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:14,520
Why are you angry?

2718
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:14,960
What happened?

2719
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:16,520
What hasn't happened?

2720
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:18,120
Everything is over.

2721
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:18,920
What do you say?

2722
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,240
Do you all went to elder
daughter's house?

2723
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:25,280
I'm asking you,

2724
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:26,520
Do you all went?

2725
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:27,440
Yes.

2726
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:30,880
She made our family ashamed.

2727
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:34,000
I'm trying to make things right.

2728
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:37,440
But you all went there and enjoyed.

2729
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:38,960
Who told you?

2730
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:39,480
Who?

2731
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:41,320
Who told you?

2732
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,560
So,it's not at fault you went there?

2733
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,720
but you bother about who said me?

2734
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:47,960
It's our fault to go
without informing you.

2735
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:50,760
You may feel hurt if you are informed.

2736
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:53,200
You would've get lost at the same way.

2737
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:55,200
Shameless beings.

2738
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:57,520
Do you all intake only food?

2739
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:58,040
Hey, stop it.

2740
02:06:58,480 --> 02:06:59,360
You are talking unnecessarily.

2741
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:00,360
What am I talking?

2742
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:01,600
Shameless clan.

2743
02:07:01,960 --> 02:07:04,080
What happened now to yell at us?

2744
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:06,200
Are you my father or am I your father?

2745
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,480
All the three are my children.

2746
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,680
Can I leave her alone if she desert us?

2747
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,320
You can understand it only
when you come of my stance in future.

2748
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,040
Leave it.

2749
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:15,440
He talks in anger.

2750
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:16,840
You talk to him equalising.

2751
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:17,440
Be silent.

2752
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:19,120
Will he talk rubbish in anger?

2753
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:21,000
What happened now to yell at us?

2754
02:07:22,040 --> 02:07:23,320
Your nephew called me and said,

2755
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:24,920
to cancel the marriage.

2756
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,640
He tells the younger girl also to elope.

2757
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:31,640
Then how about our daughter's marriage?

2758
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:32,040
Leave it.

2759
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:32,880
What the hell he says?

2760
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:34,680
Isn't there any bridegroom
for my daughter?

2761
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:35,600
I'll look after it.

2762
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,800
He says determined.

2763
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:38,440
Let him look after everything.

2764
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:40,240
I won't interfere in any stuff.

2765
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:41,320
What's this?

2766
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:42,240
Uncle talks in temper.

2767
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:42,640
Hey...

2768
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:44,000
Just be calm.

2769
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,360
That's the line of respect to you all.

2770
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:56,960
What promise you made on that day?

2771
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,440
Not even your pet dog
will go to that house.

2772
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:01,760
But except your dog,
everyone in your house went there.

2773
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:04,640
Don't stand out at my house.

2774
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:06,760
If I go in now,it's a shame to you.

2775
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:08,840
Go away afore I get in.

2776
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:13,360
Mathi made me feel ashamed.

2777
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:17,600
I mustn't leave him alive still.

2778
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,120
He must be lynched at first.

2779
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:25,320
Then only my brother-in-law will respect me.

2780
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,640
He'll come to my house to marry my sister.

2781
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:37,960
Hello,

2782
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:38,760
Elayarani!

2783
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,360
Tell me,

2784
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,560
Where are you?

2785
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:41,320
In college.

2786
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,320
I'll convey you an incident.
Listen without panic.

2787
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,200
What happened?

2788
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,760
Just now I told you not to panic.

2789
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:49,720
Okay, tell me

2790
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:52,760
The bride groom engaged to you,

2791
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:53,920
He...

2792
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:55,040
Is he dead?

2793
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:58,400
No,not to that extent.

2794
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:02,680
His household rejected you as bride.

2795
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,600
Sister-in-law!

2796
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,040
Be qualm

2797
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:09,480
How to be qualm?

2798
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:10,720
It's difficult.

2799
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:13,880
All of a sudden when you say,
what can I do?

2800
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:15,560
What can I do?

2801
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:16,760
Don't cry dear.

2802
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,360
I'll try sister-in-law.

2803
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:19,400
I'll try.

2804
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:24,080
Too young to carry on.

2805
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:31,240
I'm not worried about my brother,

2806
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:36,000
Not worried about my him.

2807
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:37,880
Are you free now?

2808
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:39,040
Why?

2809
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:41,400
Shall we enjoy a tune?

2810
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:03,880
"I'm not aghast of my brother,"

2811
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:08,280
"I'm not aghast of my father,"

2812
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:10,560
"I'm not aghast of the clan,"

2813
02:10:10,920 --> 02:10:14,800
"I'm not aghast of the whole world,"

2814
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:17,520
"I'm the rose, blossoms for you,"

2815
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:21,600
"Lift me as you wish,"

2816
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,560
"I'll go to my vicinity as mass,"

2817
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:28,360
"You are my basha of love."

2818
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:33,960
"Is your name Manickam,
lies as a secrecy to all?"

2819
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:39,440
"Come on dear... Come on dear..."

2820
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:43,000
"Come on..."

2821
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:47,920
"Come on dear... Come on dear..."

2822
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:49,200
"Come on..."

2823
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:05,800
"You're the barnyard fowl,"

2824
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:09,240
"I'm the sesame oil,"

2825
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:12,640
"You cook as you wish,"

2826
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:15,960
"I'll taste delicious."

2827
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:22,600
"I felt gloomy as presumed
that you've forsaken me,"

2828
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:29,360
"Hey dear, latched on to your hands now,"

2829
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:35,600
"We have become a remix,"

2830
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:39,320
"We'll bang sixes hereafter."

2831
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,800
"I'm not aghast of my brother,"

2832
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:46,240
"I'm not aghast of my father."

2833
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:08,360
"Look out for a auspicious date,"

2834
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:11,720
"Plant the poles for awning,"

2835
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:18,440
"Serve a good menu on the leaf to the horde,"

2836
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:21,880
"The garlands won't be withered "

2837
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:25,160
"If anyone inquire us we'll heed to it,"

2838
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:28,520
"When'll the drums bang?"

2839
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:32,000
"When'll the beatitude abound?"

2840
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:41,840
"Play the tune of the 'king of Music, Illayaraja'
and tie the knot,"

2841
02:12:41,880 --> 02:12:44,440
"I'm not aghast of my brother,"

2842
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:48,880
"I'm not aghast of my father,"

2843
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:51,120
"I'm not aghast of the clan,"

2844
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:55,400
"I'm not aghast of the whole world,"

2845
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:07,280
Selvarani,

2846
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:07,760
Aunt!

2847
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,000
Uncle asked for a cup of coffee,
didn't you give yet?

2848
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:09,840
I'll give now.

2849
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:13,840
He is the father-in-law not only to you,

2850
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:14,560
But to me also.

2851
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:15,520
Okay, be careful.

2852
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:16,120
Hmm.

2853
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:20,120
Will chill uncle by serving hot coffee.

2854
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:33,080
Okay...okay...

2855
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:33,840
Uncle, coffee.

2856
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,520
I'm not habitual of  taking coffee.

2857
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:52,120
Hello.

2858
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:16,680
I'll talk to dad.

2859
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:19,360
Don't worry.

2860
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:24,520
Dad!

2861
02:14:26,680 --> 02:14:29,160
Mathi and Illayarani love each other.

2862
02:14:29,160 --> 02:14:29,920
Is it?

2863
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:31,520
Yes,it is!

2864
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:33,560
What must I do now?

2865
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:34,960
Nothing to do dad.

2866
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:37,240
It's enough if you agree.

2867
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:38,320
If I agree?

2868
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:39,640
We'll ask for formally.

2869
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:41,840
If not?

2870
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:43,480
If not,we'll abduct her.

2871
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:43,840
Aah!

2872
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,360
Is it okay,dad?

2873
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:47,760
You go.

2874
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:50,920
Tell him to come.

2875
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:52,080
Hmm.

2876
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:52,440
Go.

2877
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:52,840
Happy dad.

2878
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:02,520
Mathi,I spoke to dad.

2879
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,160
He feels happy in soul.

2880
02:15:05,160 --> 02:15:06,360
But doesn't show off.

2881
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:07,600
You go and talk to him.

2882
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:09,080
Everything will be well and good.

2883
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:11,760
Hmm.

2884
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,160
Dad!

2885
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:21,080
Yes, come.

2886
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:26,880
What I know and your brother told,

2887
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,120
Is all these the fact?

2888
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:30,400
Yes dad.

2889
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:30,720
Hey.

2890
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:35,960
How long will you ruin a family?

2891
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:38,200
Your brother slapped them

2892
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,040
before they come out of it,

2893
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:41,120
you are ready to slap next.

2894
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:46,120
I would've sent you out of the house
on your brother's marriage.

2895
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:49,040
As you saved your brother's life,

2896
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:52,400
I left you and sent him out.

2897
02:15:54,760 --> 02:15:55,080
Hey,

2898
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:59,840
as there is no girls as siblings,
you don't know the hardship.

2899
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:08,080
On that day,Kalaiyarasi felt sad
about her relationship with brother.

2900
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:09,200
It's still in my mind.

2901
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:14,360
They are a affectionate family like our's.

2902
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:19,480
Though the marriage you
did to your brother is at fault,

2903
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:23,640
I felt happy when you unified
both the families

2904
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,440
But it's clear now,you did everything
for your sake.

2905
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,880
Dad,I promise.

2906
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:32,680
It's not for my sake.

2907
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:33,240
No...no...

2908
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:37,200
I don't even brawl for fun.

2909
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:40,080
Okay,

2910
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:43,920
I'll initiate the marriage on my own effort.

2911
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:44,800
Dad!

2912
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:45,920
My son...

2913
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:10,520
Arivu,before dad meets karunakaran,

2914
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:16,280
I'll meet him and do Illayarani's
marriage as they wished.

2915
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:19,840
It's rare that our wishes get fulfilled.

2916
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:20,920
I'm not lucky enough for it.

2917
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:41,240
If sheared,that must be done with my sickle.

2918
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:45,120
Your anger is on me.

2919
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:49,640
Don't stop your brother's marriage
enraged on me and my family.

2920
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:55,640
My dad took action on your shrimp farm
as a good deed to the public.

2921
02:18:56,200 --> 02:18:59,920
But you smashed all our
persons including my uncle.

2922
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:01,880
You closed the coconut market too.

2923
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:04,760
In that enrage,
I brawled with you.

2924
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:07,560
My brother gorged poison
and was struggling for life,

2925
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:09,960
For his sake I abducted the bride.

2926
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:13,160
If you were in the same situation,
you would've done the same.

2927
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:14,560
That's what I too did.

2928
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:18,880
It's a promise,
I doesn't know that both of your…

2929
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:21,080
…families are getting unified
after a long span.

2930
02:19:21,680 --> 02:19:25,080
My family must not bear that sin.

2931
02:19:25,560 --> 02:19:27,240
I plead not to stop the marriage.

2932
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,320
If you are still insane,
I’ll apologise to you.

2933
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:35,600
Hey, why do you fall on my foot?

2934
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,240
You are son of a respectful person.

2935
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:40,360
When my dad pleads to me,

2936
02:19:40,480 --> 02:19:42,240
it's not a fault to fall on your foot.

2937
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:43,760
Whether knowingly or not,

2938
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:46,520
our both families
unified on the brawl with you.

2939
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:49,560
We all together will make the
marriage a grand occasion.

2940
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,320
Okay, I'll leave.

2941
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:53,840
What's that wound?

2942
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,800
It's caused by your brother-in-law.

2943
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:58,880
Get that turmeric.

2944
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:00,160
It's okay brother.

2945
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:01,400
It's not painful.

2946
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:02,320
I'll take care.

2947
02:20:02,680 --> 02:20:03,200
I'll leave.

2948
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:10,760
Hey,

2949
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:11,080
Brother.

2950
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:12,160
Keep that sickle inside.

2951
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:14,760
Why brother?

2952
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:16,080
It'll be useful in future.

2953
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:17,200
I can't understand brother.

2954
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:19,240
Does he think of us as goofs?

2955
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:21,160
If he apologise,do we leave him?

2956
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:22,800
Let the marriage happen.

2957
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:25,840
I'll lynch him at the entrance
of the marriage hall.

2958
02:20:26,400 --> 02:20:27,880
Shall we buy the coconut groove?

2959
02:20:28,400 --> 02:20:31,440
It's good...very much happy.

2960
02:20:31,440 --> 02:20:32,120
In-laws in phone.

2961
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:34,760
How are you?

2962
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:38,480
I'm happy that the marriage takes place.

2963
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:39,680
So happy about it.

2964
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:06,800
Everyone must attend the marriage.

2965
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:22,400
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"

2966
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:27,480
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"

2967
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:32,240
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"

2968
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:37,320
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"

2969
02:21:37,320 --> 02:21:42,680
"An affinity born like a thread
from banana fibre!"

2970
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:47,880
"It's the happiness in this world!"

2971
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:58,040
"Who's to whom is contend by
god after gambol of ploy,"

2972
02:21:58,040 --> 02:21:58,080
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"

2973
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:07,880
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"

2974
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:16,080
"Though both hearts conjoin together,"

2975
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,320
"Though both become an unitary soul,"

2976
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:23,680
"The happiest ceremony,
the marriage doesn't happen to all,"

2977
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:26,120
"The honorary justice we own,"

2978
02:22:26,120 --> 02:22:28,440
"The wounds we suffer,"

2979
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:33,080
"The affinity won't heed to us,"

2980
02:22:33,080 --> 02:22:37,840
"Oft,the ardor tunes a lullaby,"

2981
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:43,240
"Oft,the ardor beheads us "

2982
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:48,320
"Known we'll be burnt as fire,
we become wood."

2983
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:53,760
"To unify the relationship."

2984
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:58,520
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"

2985
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:03,600
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"

2986
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:08,360
"Oh dear!The castle is divine,"

2987
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:13,440
"It holds a festive mood per diem in life,"

2988
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:17,320
"An affinity born like a thread
from banana fibre!"

2989
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:18,880
Welcome...

2990
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,720
Elayarani is not seen.

2991
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:23,520
What do you say?

2992
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:25,840
What are you blabbering? I searched all over.

2993
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,760
Did you checked well?

2994
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:27,680
Yes.

2995
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:29,960
Mom, i'll check it.

2996
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:31,440
Nothing will be wrong.

2997
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:32,640
Wait, i'll check.

2998
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:36,600
You go and see.

2999
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:40,640
Who's evil eyes bestowed on our family?

3000
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:42,360
All the ill things happens only to us!

3001
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:43,720
Be quite.

3002
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:44,600
Don't worry.

3003
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,960
Nothing will happen.

3004
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:46,720
What to do?

3005
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:47,400
Call her.

3006
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:49,200
Her phone is switched off.

3007
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:50,520
No...

3008
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:51,920
Don't know what to do?

3009
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:53,120
What happened?

3010
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,560
I searched everywhere.

3011
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:55,920
She is not anywhere.

3012
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:58,080
No...
No...

3013
02:23:58,080 --> 02:23:58,960
What I'll do?

3014
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:00,480
Don't know where she is!

3015
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:01,400
What happened brother-in-law?

3016
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,040
She is not here.

3017
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:07,680
Is she not here?

3018
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:08,760
Is she eloped?

3019
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:11,120
She made us to be ashame.

3020
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:12,160
Is she eloped?

3021
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:14,080
Why do you talk ill?

3022
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,200
Then how to talk?

3023
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:16,200
Please.

3024
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:16,960
Stop it uncle.

3025
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:20,200
Did I intended for this relationship?

3026
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:21,320
It's you asked for.

3027
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:26,360
Children don't understand
the desire of parents.

3028
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:29,720
I came to your house
neglecting my father's words.

3029
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:32,200
For that your whole family cheated me

3030
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:36,080
Did I struggled all the way
to divide the families?

3031
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:39,400
Nothing is going to happen hereafter.

3032
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:41,000
That's not son-in-law.

3033
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,080
You say it easily.

3034
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:45,040
Instead of making us to be
ashame each and every time,

3035
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:48,400
It's better you would've
slapped us with waders.

3036
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:50,560
Why do you talk so harsh?

3037
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:54,400
The relationship comes only once in life.

3038
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:56,400
We stand here for it.

3039
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,360
I don't want this compromises.

3040
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:01,040
Not as compromise,

3041
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:03,960
it's a fact that
both families wish to unify.

3042
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:08,800
For that,both of you have must brought
up your daughters disciplined.

3043
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:18,800
We don't have any rights to talk to you,

3044
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:25,680
Though you are younger,
i apologise on behalf of my children.

3045
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,360
What are you doing?

3046
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:32,000
Why do you fall on his feet?

3047
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:33,800
I'll do this marriage.

3048
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,080
It's my responsibility to do this marriage.

3049
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:37,720
She made us to bend down.

3050
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:38,440
Hey,Mathi...

3051
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:42,960
Where is she?

3052
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:50,320
What?

3053
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:50,720
Hey.

3054
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:52,280
What?

3055
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:53,680
Where is Elayarani?

3056
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:55,040
I don't know dad.

3057
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:56,280
Tell me.

3058
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:59,280
I don't know dad.

3059
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:00,680
Where did you hid her?

3060
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:02,120
I promise,I don't know dad.

3061
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:03,680
Why do you ask him brother?

3062
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,280
I can't hide anything.

3063
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:08,320
Ask him.

3064
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:10,160
Dad!

3065
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:11,480
What's this?

3066
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:15,040
What's happening here?

3067
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:17,440
What's happening here?

3068
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:22,440
It's true that we both loved each other.

3069
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:26,400
What do you say?

3070
02:26:27,360 --> 02:26:30,880
But I promise, I don't know where is she now.

3071
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:32,840
No...

3072
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:44,080
How many times you makes us ashame?

3073
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:46,160
Where is my sister?

3074
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:46,840
Mathi...

3075
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:49,840
No...

3076
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:52,080
Where is she?

3077
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:52,880
Really I don't know.

3078
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:53,560
Tell now

3079
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:55,480
They are asking.

3080
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:56,280
Tell them.

3081
02:26:58,040 --> 02:26:58,920
Don't hit him.

3082
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:00,160
Where is she?

3083
02:27:00,680 --> 02:27:01,320
Tell now.

3084
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:03,640
He mustn't have done any fault.

3085
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:04,160
No...

3086
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:06,080
Tell now.

3087
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:08,600
Tell them not to hit him.

3088
02:27:10,480 --> 02:27:11,960
Brother-in-law,ask where his brother now?

3089
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,440
His brother knows where is the bride?

3090
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:18,000
Past, he abducted the bride
for the sake of his brother.

3091
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,320
Don't hurt my brother.

3092
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:20,800
Today, his brother might did the same.

3093
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:23,800
Tell me, where is your brother?

3094
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:29,000
They are hitting our son, no one is bothered.

3095
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:29,680
Please ask them not to hit.

3096
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:31,160
I don't know.

3097
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:34,000
I promise on my dad.

3098
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,040
Believe me.

3099
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:36,120
Mathi...

3100
02:27:36,440 --> 02:27:37,560
Listen here.

3101
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:38,760
Hey, who are you?

3102
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:42,600
When he promise on his dad,
a person meant solely everything to us.

3103
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:44,680
Then it's true that he doesn't know.

3104
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:49,840
It'll be known now about your brother!

3105
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:51,520
Selvarani,

3106
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:52,240
I don't know uncle.

3107
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:54,000
Don't hurt my sister-in-law.

3108
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:57,840
Tell me, Elayarani,

3109
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:00,480
Selvarani,where is your husband?

3110
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:03,200
Hello Elayarani,where are you?

3111
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:05,560
Aunt, she is in our home.

3112
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:06,720
What is she doing in home?

3113
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:07,360
Didn't I tell you?

3114
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:09,200
Do you know what you did?

3115
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:11,560
You be there, we'll come now.

3116
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:13,080
What to do now?

3117
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:14,320
Brother,she is in home.

3118
02:28:14,360 --> 02:28:15,840
Everything went wrong.

3119
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:17,600
Don't know why does she do it?

3120
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:21,200
Why does she do it?

3121
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:28,120
You would've asked me in person dad.

3122
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:35,320
To keep up your word on this marriage,
I fell on others feet.

3123
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:36,720
Mathi...

3124
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:40,000
Mathi...

3125
02:28:42,360 --> 02:28:43,360
I'm leaving dad.

3126
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:45,640
Mathi...

3127
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:47,960
I hurt without my conscience.

3128
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:49,520
Don't tell that dad.

3129
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,120
I'll cry my heart out.

3130
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:12,840
Sister-in-law!

3131
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,440
What the hell you did?

3132
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:16,280
You made the whole family to be ashamed.

3133
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:20,040
I thought atleast one of my sister
will be light of life,

3134
02:29:20,040 --> 02:29:21,560
but both are charcoal.

3135
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:22,040
Brother!

3136
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:26,480
Mom,forgive me.

3137
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,040
Dad,forgive me.

3138
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:29,400
Is it forgivable?

3139
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:31,200
It's my fault.

3140
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:33,640
A fault,I did unknowingly.

3141
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:36,600
Instead of suffering in other's house,

3142
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:42,320
it's good to stay back in our house
with his rememberance.

3143
02:29:43,160 --> 02:29:45,200
You would've told us afore.

3144
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:52,240
I made my mind hard,
to fulfill your wish of unifying the families.

3145
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:57,160
I can't be as strong as Mathi.

3146
02:29:57,160 --> 02:29:58,920
That's why I left.

3147
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:06,040
It's not only him,
I don't want this marriage.

3148
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:08,800
I'll stay in our home.

3149
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:14,040
You stay here itself.

3150
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:25,440
Brother,I'm not saying it to fulfill my love.

3151
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:30,160
I promise on our whole family,

3152
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:34,600
I'll be as your sister throughout my life.

3153
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:46,160
Did she eloped like her elder sister?

3154
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:49,080
Yes,

3155
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:50,440
Ponder a little,

3156
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:53,960
when she is bold enough to
go to home from here,

3157
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:56,640
Can't she elope?

3158
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:01,880
We unified with our elder one,
who deserted us.

3159
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:05,080
Why we must hurt her
when she wish to be with us?

3160
02:31:05,080 --> 02:31:05,720
Yes.

3161
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:09,920
Elayarani, don't cry to me.

3162
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:11,400
Ask dad whatever it is.

3163
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,600
What do you say?

3164
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,280
Past,I spoke to you on frustration.

3165
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:19,520
How long my life span will be?

3166
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:21,320
Dad!

3167
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:22,680
Yes.

3168
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:28,760
Yes,you must take care of both
the girls from my stance after me.

3169
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:30,320
Dad,why do you go emotional?

3170
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:32,840
Brother,

3171
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:33,560
In-laws,

3172
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:36,400
In-law,

3173
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:41,720
Oft, youngsters behave matured,

3174
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:45,480
We the elders become immature.

3175
02:31:46,360 --> 02:31:47,480
That's what happened now.

3176
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:53,160
Before we came here,
 I know what would've happened.

3177
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:57,440
In-law,

3178
02:31:58,680 --> 02:31:59,440
Shall I ask you a favour?

3179
02:32:01,640 --> 02:32:04,360
Will you agree my son
to marry your daughter?

3180
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:06,520
What's this?

3181
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:08,960
If you haven't asked,
we must have come to you.

3182
02:32:09,200 --> 02:32:09,680
Sister,

3183
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:11,920
I know what do you  think about?

3184
02:32:13,480 --> 02:32:15,520
You are more than my own brother.

3185
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:20,200
We are happy to send our
younger daughter to your home.

3186
02:32:22,200 --> 02:32:22,760
Come on.

3187
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:25,520
Brother!

3188
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:26,840
Go.

3189
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:29,240
Be happy.

3190
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:36,720
I don't know about your relationships.

3191
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:40,120
When she came to our home for the function,

3192
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:43,480
I wish she must marry our son Mathi.

3193
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:46,040
It happened so.

3194
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:47,800
So happy.

3195
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:48,280
Bro,

3196
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:50,040
I'm so happy uncle.

3197
02:32:52,120 --> 02:32:52,840
Hello.

3198
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:55,400
Hello, is it Govindaraj mudaliyar?

3199
02:32:55,440 --> 02:32:56,000
Yes.

3200
02:32:56,280 --> 02:32:57,760
I'm Kannan speaking from pesticides shop.

3201
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:58,320
What's the stuff?

3202
02:32:58,360 --> 02:32:59,720
Is your elder son, Arivazhagan?

3203
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:00,160
Yes.

3204
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:01,920
Then your younger son is Mathiazhagan?

3205
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:02,280
Yes.

3206
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:05,800
Mathi bought all the pesticide content
from my shop and left in hurry.

3207
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:06,680
What do you say?

3208
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:08,840
It seems he'll gorge the whole and die.

3209
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:10,000
What do you say?

3210
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,480
One more important stuff.

3211
02:33:12,320 --> 02:33:14,640
Elder son is yet to remit the
amount for the content he bought.

3212
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:17,400
Your younger son also bought in debt.

3213
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:20,800
Either give me the money
or the contents of my shop.

3214
02:33:20,920 --> 02:33:21,480
Hey!

3215
02:33:21,760 --> 02:33:22,200
Hello.

3216
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:23,600
Hello.

3217
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:25,800
Hanged up.

3218
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:30,360
Others gorge poison unbearable
of the  mounted debts.

3219
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:33,600
But both of these guys
made debt to gorge poison.

3220
02:33:34,360 --> 02:33:35,760
Don't know what family is it!

3221
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,680
Mathi, please stop.

3222
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,320
Listen to us.

3223
02:33:38,360 --> 02:33:39,040
Mathi...

3224
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:39,680
Listen to us.

3225
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:40,840
I won't listen.

3226
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:42,440
I don't want anyone.

3227
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:44,080
I'll do whatever I wish.

3228
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,280
Mathi! Mathi!

3229
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:48,320
Yes, you did all the mistakes
and plead him now.

3230
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:49,960
Tell them clearly.

3231
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:51,680
What happened now?

3232
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,560
Is it a fault if both the brothers love
the girls of the same household?

3233
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:56,200
Do you know a gossip?

3234
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:56,520
What's it?

3235
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:59,160
I alone marry both the sisters.

3236
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:01,280
Next week is my marriage
with my wife's sister.

3237
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:03,840
My wife distributes the invitations to all.

3238
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:05,520
Not even a single invitation
will be given to you.

3239
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:06,840
It's the fact.

3240
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:07,760
Shut up.

3241
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:10,280
Be good.

3242
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:12,600
But don't be the best.

3243
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:14,080
Mathi,

3244
02:34:14,120 --> 02:34:15,360
Uncle is pleading,stop.

3245
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:18,520
He doesn't listen to his dad itself.

3246
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:19,800
Don't stop.

3247
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:25,080
Mathi...

3248
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:27,280
Welcome dude,

3249
02:34:27,560 --> 02:34:28,000
Hey,

3250
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,040
We can discuss it later.

3251
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,800
We can identify you,turn on.

3252
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:31,720
Brother-in-law,

3253
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:32,800
Why is he here?

3254
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:35,000
As you don't have the responsibility,

3255
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:35,680
So I arranged his marriage.

3256
02:34:35,720 --> 02:34:36,400
Oh,it's your work.

3257
02:34:36,440 --> 02:34:37,880
Leave now.

3258
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:39,680
Respectfully I said in telugu.

3259
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:40,440
Hey,
Mathi.

3260
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:43,080
Hey,who is she?

3261
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:43,920
She is new,you go now.

3262
02:34:43,960 --> 02:34:44,880
Will talk to you later.

3263
02:34:44,920 --> 02:34:48,360
Mathi!Mathi!

3264
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,160
Hey mathi, what's all this?

3265
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:50,880
Who is getting married?

3266
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:52,880
See, it's a temple.

3267
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:54,680
People will come and go.

3268
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:57,960
Pray god,take prasadam and leave.

3269
02:34:57,960 --> 02:34:59,360
Hey, he is your dad.

3270
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:01,680
Even if he asks the prasadam
is available in hot.

3271
02:35:01,680 --> 02:35:02,120
Hey,

3272
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:03,680
What happens here now?

3273
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:06,320
A marriage is going to  happen here.

3274
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:07,440
Marriage?

3275
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:09,680
If you wish,stay back.

3276
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:11,320
if not you leave.

3277
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:13,000
Call the bride.

3278
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,160
Uncle, get the bride soon.

3279
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:15,280
You are doing too proud.

3280
02:35:23,960 --> 02:35:25,760
Mathi, what's this?

3281
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:27,040
No..

3282
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:27,800
Mathi...

3283
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:29,040
What is it?

3284
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:31,360
Son-in-law!

3285
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:32,920
Hello, who are you?

3286
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:33,600
Aunt!

3287
02:35:33,800 --> 02:35:34,720
To whom?

3288
02:35:34,760 --> 02:35:35,240
No...

3289
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:35,720
Son-in-law!

3290
02:35:35,720 --> 02:35:37,120
Mr.Rajangam sir,

3291
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:38,240
What you mean, sir?

3292
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:39,560
Or else madam?

3293
02:35:40,040 --> 02:35:41,040
I also do comedy.

3294
02:35:41,800 --> 02:35:43,200
Dude, we have taken a good decision.

3295
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:43,720
Don't be in hurry.

3296
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:44,240
Yes.

3297
02:35:44,280 --> 02:35:45,800
I also took a good decision.

3298
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:46,960
You all watch it.

3299
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:47,840
What?  Listen to him.

3300
02:35:47,880 --> 02:35:49,080
Listen to me first.

3301
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:50,680
Do you know to chant mantras?

3302
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:54,520
Call Elayarani.

3303
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:58,160
Phone rings.

3304
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:58,800
Hello,

3305
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:01,080
Just now called! she comes suddenly!

3306
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:03,920
What?

3307
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:05,360
Nothing.

3308
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:07,120
Heard some noise outside.

3309
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,160
Doing entertainment.

3310
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:12,320
Flowers, designs etc...

3311
02:36:12,360 --> 02:36:13,400
Arrangements are amazing!

3312
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:14,440
To whom is the marriage?

3313
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:17,440
It's to my kin.

3314
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:18,360
To me?

3315
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:20,320
Yes, to you.

3316
02:36:20,600 --> 02:36:21,320
To me?

3317
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:22,680
I promise.

3318
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:23,240
The marriage is to you.

3319
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:23,920
Believe me.

3320
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:24,560
Come.

3321
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:25,640
Go... Go...

3322
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:28,640
Yes, how many times his
marriage gets disrupted?

3323
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:30,680
I feel pity for him.

3324
02:36:30,680 --> 02:36:32,880
In the first marriage,
 I abducted the bride for my brother's sake.

3325
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:36,280
In the next marriage,
 she rejected him.

3326
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:38,720
So,I arranged this marriage with
Mandiramoorthy's daughter.

3327
02:36:38,720 --> 02:36:39,480
He is pityful.

3328
02:36:39,520 --> 02:36:40,720
Dude is blabbering,

3329
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:41,760
Can't you help him?

3330
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:42,520
Yes,I'll proceed...

3331
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:46,920
When we mention his name not only bride
even banquet hall is not available.

3332
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:48,160
Don't cry.

3333
02:36:48,480 --> 02:36:49,600
I'll also be sentimental.

3334
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:51,440
Dude, do you like the bride?

3335
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:52,320
If not also she is only bride.

3336
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:53,160
Sit down, tie the mangal sutra.

3337
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:55,400
He panicked us in few minutes.

3338
02:36:55,440 --> 02:36:56,800
Shower ur blessings.

3339
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:57,720
Bang the drums!

3340
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:58,680
Are you in love with anyone?

3341
02:36:58,720 --> 02:37:00,000
I.....

3342
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,080
It's okay,even if so...

3344
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:03,080
Why are you in hurry?

3345
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:04,880
I didn't love anyone.

3346
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:05,760
God!

3347
02:37:05,800 --> 02:37:07,080
I'm yet to chant the mantras.

3348
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:08,960
He'll listen in Whatsapp

(Chanting Mantras)

3350
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:21,560
Greetings!

3351
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:22,360
What's the stuff?

3352
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:24,520
My brother has fallen in love.

3353
02:37:24,800 --> 02:37:25,200
I know.

3354
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:27,440
But it's not accepted in house.

3355
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:28,720
I know.

3356
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:32,360
He shouldn't gorge poison like me,

3357
02:37:32,360 --> 02:37:35,800
so I'm buying the poison contents
from all the shops.

3358
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:36,880
No...

3359
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:41,440
Mathi...

3360
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:43,680
Nothing happened to you, isn't it?

3361
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:48,640
Is it?

3362
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:52,880
You said a life will be lost,
whose life is that?

3363
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:54,480
It's mine.

3364
02:37:54,520 --> 02:37:55,280
Why?

3365
02:37:55,320 --> 02:37:57,560
Mathi told me to say so.

3366
02:37:57,560 --> 02:38:00,320
He told me to postpone
the marriage for a year,

3367
02:38:00,360 --> 02:38:02,600
so that he'll get rid of the problems.

3368
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:03,440
Why are you here?

3369
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:05,840
Anyone can come to temple,durai.

3370
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:07,520
But you shouldn't come.

3371
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:08,040
Why?

3372
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:09,640
I came after knowing the history.

3373
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:10,960
You know the history?

3374
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:13,040
Tell now to the public.

3375
02:38:13,320 --> 02:38:15,080
Who built Tajmahal?

3376
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,080
Bharathiraja...

3377
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:18,400
That's the film directed by him.

3378
02:38:18,440 --> 02:38:20,480
Why not we slap him?

3379
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:34,520
