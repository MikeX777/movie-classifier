1
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:54,262
What has turned into a
classic Formula 1 season.

2
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,860
With the weather
conditions so uncertain,

3
00:00:57,972 --> 00:00:59,178
the drivers prepare for...

4
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,814
the track is still
dangerously wet,

5
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:05,263
but following a drivers' meeting,

6
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,233
a decision has finally been taken.

7
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,415
Three minutes to go.

8
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:11,174
Everybody off the grid now.

9
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:29,257
Twenty-five drivers start
every season in Formula 1,

10
00:01:29,332 --> 00:01:32,415
and each year two of us die.

11
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,539
What kind of person
does a job like this?

12
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:38,694
Not normal men, for sure.

13
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:43,016
Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.

14
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:46,093
People who are desperate
to make a mark

15
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:48,453
and are prepared to die trying.

16
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:51,897
My name is Niki Lauda,

17
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:55,381
and racing people know
me for two things.

18
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:59,218
The first is my rivalry with him.

19
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,110
You want to change?

20
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,296
Photographers, please
clear the grid.

21
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,780
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

22
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,497
No, he's going on wets.

23
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:13,735
I don't know why it
became such a big thing.

24
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:17,140
We were just drivers busting
each other's balls.

25
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:20,578
To me this is perfectly normal,

26
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:22,814
but other people saw
it differently,

27
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,816
that whatever it was
between us went deeper.

28
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,270
Then we go on wets too.

29
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,094
The other thing I'm remembered for

30
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:47,938
is what happened on
1st August, 1976,

31
00:02:48,012 --> 00:02:51,694
when I was chasing
him like an asshole.

32
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:23,657
Trauma trolley, please.

33
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:24,818
Hello, I think the racetrack

34
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,252
telephoned ahead
that I was coming.

35
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,717
Hunt. James Hunt.

36
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:35,815
What's the matter? No one ever
seen a spot of blood before?

37
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,823
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

38
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,861
We all thought you'd
been in an accident.

39
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:45,019
I have.

40
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,822
If you call a
friendly disagreement

41
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,335
with another driver an accident.

42
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,256
What did you disagree about?

43
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:57,902
It's none of your business.

44
00:03:58,012 --> 00:04:00,014
Sorry.

45
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:02,377
His wife.

46
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,938
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

47
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:10,095
It was a nasty blow. Done
with a bloody crowbar.

48
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:13,777
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

49
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,613
Only what she asked me to do.

50
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,377
Which was...

51
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,538
I'd be happy to show
you, if you like.

52
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:29,019
Oh. Sorry.

53
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:32,932
I have a theory why women
like racing drivers.

54
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:35,613
It's not because they
respect what we do,

55
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,502
driving round and
round in circles.

56
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:41,143
Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.

57
00:04:42,372 --> 00:04:44,454
It's our closeness to death.

58
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:48,978
You see, the closer you are to
death, the more alive you feel.

59
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:52,056
The more alive you are. And
they can see that in you.

60
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,055
They feel that in you.

61
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,453
My name is James Hunt.

62
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:59,574
My father is a stockbroker,

63
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:03,219
my sister is a barrister and
my brother is an accountant.

64
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,737
And I...

65
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:07,902
Well, I do this.

66
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:10,937
It's a wonderful way to live.

67
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,140
It's the only way to drive.

68
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:16,493
As if each day is your last.

69
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:28,252
I've never been to a
Grand Prix before.

70
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:30,175
Oh, you still haven't.

71
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:32,778
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

72
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:35,853
It's a lower division,

73
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,458
where idiots like me mess about

74
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,519
in the hope of being
talent-spotted

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,537
to race in Formula 1.

76
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:43,614
- You look disappointed.
- No.

77
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,301
Ah. You only slept with me because
you thought I was famous.

78
00:05:47,372 --> 00:05:48,942
That's not true.

79
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,614
Don't worry. I will be one day.

80
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,296
Morning, everyone.

81
00:05:53,332 --> 00:05:54,936
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

82
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,456
Nursie, this is Bubbles
Horsley, team manager.

83
00:05:58,532 --> 00:05:59,613
How do you do?

84
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:01,776
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:04,816
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

86
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:08,817
And Alexander, Lord
Hesketh, the team's owner.

87
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,342
How do you do?

88
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,662
Fine, thanks.

89
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,581
Well done, Superstar.

90
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:18,178
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

91
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:20,021
Lotus 59.

92
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:22,863
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

93
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:25,816
She's no beauty, but
goes like the clappers.

94
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,532
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

95
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,574
Good sign, actually.
Means he's stoked.

96
00:06:36,652 --> 00:06:40,862
AH Formula 3 cars to the
assembly area now, please.

97
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:55,781
Drivers please bring them to
the scrutineering bay now.

98
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:57,742
All right, Superstar?

99
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,536
Never better, patron.

100
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:02,052
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

101
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:04,943
Quick toke of this.

102
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:08,742
At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,

103
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:12,860
with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him

104
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,543
and Dave Walker completing Row 1.

105
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:18,092
Row 2 is Mike Beuttler
and Dave Morgan,

106
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,339
with Tony Trimmer
and Gerry Birrell.

107
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Who's that?

108
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:22,977
He's new.

109
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:26,296
- Some German.
- Austrian.

110
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,455
He's been here since 5:00
am, walking the track.

111
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,899
You might actually have to
concentrate today, James.

112
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,576
You'll need these.

113
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:36,823
Okay, start her up.

114
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:39,372
Ah. What music.

115
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:40,902
They could never have imagined it,

116
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,259
those pioneers who
invented the automobile,

117
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:45,477
that it would possess
us like this,

118
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,582
in our imaginations,
in our dreams.

119
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,619
Nursie, men love women,

120
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:52,496
but even more than that,

121
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,894
men love cars.

122
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:06,175
- Come on, James.
- James. Come on, James.

123
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:08,583
Go, James.

124
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,413
Hunt's still in the lead,

125
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,654
but Niki Lauda is
right on his tail.

126
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:31,296
Hunt and Lauda are proving to
be in a class of their own.

127
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:32,936
They're leaving the
pack far behind.

128
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:34,936
Herr Red Devil's on his tail.

129
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,054
Lauda takes a look
down the inside...

130
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,456
and he's sold him a dummy.

131
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:51,974
Lauda is through.
He's in the lead.

132
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,213
Hunt will be determined to
make up for that mistake.

133
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:03,542
Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.

134
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:05,620
Lauda's not leaving any gap.

135
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:14,737
The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.

136
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:20,735
Oh. There's contact.

137
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:30,735
The leaders have spun out.
Lauda's facing the wrong way.

138
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:33,699
The back marker's gone through.

139
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,656
You can see why
Hunt's fellow drivers

140
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,573
call him Hunt the Shunt.

141
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:42,013
Asshole.

142
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:43,856
- Go on, James.
- The Kraut's out of it.

143
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:46,095
Lauda is clearly furious.

144
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:49,619
There's every reason to expect
sharp words in the pits.

145
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,581
It's gonna be victory for Hunt.

146
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:55,014
It's gonna be an ignominious
defeat for Niki Lauda.

147
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,623
So James Hunt scores his third
major Formula 3 win of the season

148
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:04,932
here at Crystal Palace,

149
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:07,783
after a desperate
battle with Niki Lauda.

150
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:09,581
Lauda was unable to restart

151
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,423
after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out

152
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,693
in the last lap of the race.

153
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:16,812
Hard luck. Better luck next time.

154
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,897
Hey, asshole.

155
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,134
That was my line. I
had that corner.

156
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:23,834
Do you mean the one
that you spun out

157
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,455
of and finished
facing the other way?

158
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,893
I think that corner had you.

159
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,498
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

160
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:33,416
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

161
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,420
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

162
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,415
Fuck you. What's your name?

163
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:45,421
James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember
it, my little Jerry friend.

164
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:47,422
Jawohl. Remember ze name.

165
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,262
And it's very simple.
Hunt. It rhymes with...

166
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,418
cunt.

167
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,972
A word that happens to
describe you perfectly.

168
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,017
Who was that?

169
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,254
I've no idea. He looks
like a rat, doesn't he?

170
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,017
In my home town, Vienna,

171
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:05,774
my family is famous for
one thing, business.

172
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,619
My grandfather was a businessman,

173
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,537
my father, too.

174
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,461
So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,

175
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:16,341
they had a few things to say.

176
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,380
Never.

177
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,460
Racing is for playboys
and dilettantes.

178
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,260
Frivolous amateurs with
nothing in their heads.

179
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,590
The name Lauda...

180
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,600
belongs with politicians
and economists,

181
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,600
on the front pages.

182
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,100
What if this is all I can do?

183
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,190
Then you need my money
more than ever,

184
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,480
so do as I say and follow me
into the family business.

185
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:42,817
Gut.

186
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,410
Keep your money.

187
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,700
Don't invest in me.

188
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,330
But when I'm world champion

189
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,370
and my name is on the
front pages too...

190
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,460
you will regret it.

191
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,590
Get out and never
show your face again.

192
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:05,494
So if my family wasn't
going to help me,

193
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:09,338
I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.

194
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:12,382
I found a Formula 1
team with an okay car

195
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:14,540
and an owner who had
run out of money

196
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,814
and was willing to
accept my terms.

197
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:18,896
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

198
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,776
I'm delighted to say

199
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,730
that the winner of the
Guild of Motoring

200
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:24,379
Writers Award Driver
of the Year...

201
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:27,073
is James Hunt.

202
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:31,937
Superb news.

203
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,854
- Well done, James.
- Superstar.

204
00:12:35,012 --> 00:12:36,457
Fantastic.

205
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:40,219
- Well done. Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

206
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:41,453
Yes.

207
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:42,863
Erm...

208
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,702
You know, my parents always
wanted me to be a doctor...

209
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,900
or a stockbroker or something.

210
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:49,696
They gave me the
first-class education,

211
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:51,854
but, well, that all
went terribly wrong

212
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,972
and I ended up with you lot.

213
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,292
Thank you. I need it
more than you do.

214
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:04,098
I mean, I have a hot head, an
inability to tolerate discipline.

215
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,577
- Yes.
- Very true.

216
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,135
I fall out with people
left and right.

217
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:10,363
The only creatures
I've ever really

218
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:11,821
loved or have treated honourably

219
00:13:11,892 --> 00:13:13,894
are budgerigars.

220
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:19,217
So in any normal area of life I'd
be... or I am, a total liability.

221
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:21,892
The only thing I've got going
for me is I'm quick in a car.

222
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,012
So, thank you for this and
for acknowledging that.

223
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:25,497
I'm going to give it to my father

224
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,336
and tell him to put
it on the mantelpiece

225
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:29,733
and imagine it's a first-class
degree in medicine.

226
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,935
Well done, Superstar.

227
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:49,578
Another season like that and I'll
move you up to the big time.

228
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,262
Come on, you don't
think I'm ready now?

229
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,700
You are. I'm not. I've got
to find you a car first.

230
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,173
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

231
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,649
Don't wait too long.
You don't want

232
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,852
him to do what Lauda just did.

233
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,616
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

234
00:14:02,652 --> 00:14:04,859
Well, how the hell did he
do that? He's a nobody.

235
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,377
He's never won a bloody thing.

236
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:08,375
Apparently, took out a
loan and bought his way in

237
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,102
with two million
Austrian schillings.

238
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:11,617
Jesus.

239
00:14:31,132 --> 00:14:34,181
Niki Lauda. Here for
pre-season testing. BRM?

240
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:38,502
Sign the release form. I'll
let them know you're here.

241
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:51,777
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

242
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:54,736
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay.

243
00:14:54,812 --> 00:14:57,497
Let me introduce you to
our number-one driver,

244
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,574
Clay Regazzoni.

245
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:02,701
- How are you?
- Good.

246
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:06,456
- Pleasure.
- And these are your mechanics.

247
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:11,461
They're reporting exclusively
to you, as per contract.

248
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:13,296
Pleasure. Do you
wanna see the car?

249
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,817
Sure.

250
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:18,263
Hello.

251
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,738
There she is. P160.

252
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:29,138
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

253
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,582
How much does she weigh?

254
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:34,338
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

255
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:37,138
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

256
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:40,341
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

257
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:42,335
Okay.

258
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,699
What horsepower are
you getting? 490?

259
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:47,173
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

260
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:48,663
It needs to be 500,

261
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,416
and the engine needs
to be 20 kilo lighter.

262
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,732
We already tried.

263
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:52,973
- Tried what?
- Everything.

264
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:54,692
We replaced the entire
exhaust system.

265
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:58,020
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

266
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,497
Now the engine block.

267
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,303
Any mounting or fixing
plates, strip it out also.

268
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,695
When you've done that, we have
to look at the aerodynamics,

269
00:16:18,772 --> 00:16:20,536
front and rear wing.

270
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:40,054
Okay, thank you. Good night.

271
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:01,457
What was Regazzoni's time?

272
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:04,743
1:53.

273
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,936
Okay, now put him in my car, and
he'll go round two seconds faster.

274
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:11,061
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

275
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:16,379
We've been working
on it all night.

276
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,500
Put Regazzoni in the
car. See what happens.

277
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,492
I don't understand. Why
am I supposed to do this?

278
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:22,872
I don't know, Clay. He just wants
you to take it for a spin.

279
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,217
Gloves, please.

280
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,737
'Fanculo.

281
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,981
- I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

282
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,054
What did you do to the car?

283
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:18,944
That's information
I will share with

284
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:20,659
you under certain conditions only.

285
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,337
Go on.

286
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:25,096
A guaranteed place in the team,

287
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,972
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

288
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,816
Are you crazy?

289
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:34,459
Clay's a senior figure in Formula
1. You're just a rookie.

290
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:37,372
Well, the only reason we took you
on is because you're paying us.

291
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:40,895
Well, as of now, if you want me
to stay, we rip up the contract.

292
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:43,703
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous.

293
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,294
Was he quicker in my car?

294
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:49,014
He was, wasn't he?

295
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,973
Did he go two seconds faster?

296
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,057
2.3.

297
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,900
So, have a think,

298
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,773
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

299
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,183
Hey, Niki.

300
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:26,462
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

301
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:27,573
What?

302
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:32,294
If it's the track manager you're
taking on your date tonight...

303
00:19:33,332 --> 00:19:34,902
It's none of your business.

304
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:38,738
Okay, but if you want my
advice, I'd let this one go.

305
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:43,733
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

306
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:49,263
Agnes's last boyfriend was
a British Formula 2 driver

307
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:51,653
who has a reputation
for two things.

308
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,417
For being a little
crazy on the track,

309
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:58,736
and for going all night and all
day and all night again in bed.

310
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:02,299
He's a good driver, but an
immortal fuck, apparently.

311
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:05,342
I don't know about you, but that's
not an act I'd like to follow.

312
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,734
But if that doesn't bother you...

313
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:15,622
What's his name, the driver?

314
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:17,377
Hunt. James Hunt.

315
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:24,939
You see, you share information
and I share information.

316
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,499
That's what team-mates are for.

317
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:40,222
Where the hell are we going?

318
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:42,579
I promise it'll be worth it.

319
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:44,097
Just keep them closed.

320
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:45,977
Wait for it.

321
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,621
Wait for it.

322
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:54,418
There. What do you say?

323
00:20:54,532 --> 00:20:56,102
She's Formula 1.

324
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,216
Yes, she is, Superstar.

325
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,462
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

326
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,943
And since the economics of F1

327
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,573
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

328
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,053
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

329
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:10,763
we might as well
be doing it on the

330
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:12,221
big roulette table in Formula 1.

331
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:15,614
You fat, little, inbred
beauty. Come here.

332
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:23,254
Actually, credit where it's
due, we got the idea from Niki.

333
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,455
- Who?
- Lauda.

334
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:28,297
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

335
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,942
I thought, Bloody
hell, he's right.

336
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:33,574
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

337
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:37,657
No vulgar logos for
cigarettes or condoms.

338
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:40,260
Just plain white
with the flags. Ooh.

339
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:43,662
And racing overalls which read,

340
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:47,378
Sex. Breakfast of champions.

341
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,941
So, when do we start?

342
00:21:52,892 --> 00:21:55,099
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

343
00:21:55,412 --> 00:21:57,983
I've been waiting for
this my whole life.

344
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,940
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello.

345
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:10,776
When the season started,
people wondered

346
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:13,902
whether Lord Hesketh and his
team of upper-class enthusiasts

347
00:22:14,252 --> 00:22:18,655
were bringing glamour to the
racing community, or just comedy.

348
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:20,814
Certainly, it was the first
time anyone had seen

349
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:24,453
a butler serving oysters
and caviar in the pits.

350
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:27,297
But they have made
quite an impact.

351
00:22:27,372 --> 00:22:30,535
Sixth in France, fourth in
Britain and third in Holland.

352
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:34,219
AH drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.

353
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,374
A severe crash at the Esses.

354
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:38,501
Red flag. There is a
car off the track.

355
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:40,256
And reports are reaching me

356
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:42,539
that there has been a serious
accident in qualifying.

357
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:44,174
Er, the identity of the driver we

358
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:45,612
don't currently
have at the moment,

359
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,699
but, as you can tell
from all the activity

360
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:49,416
going on behind me
towards the track,

361
00:22:49,492 --> 00:22:51,893
it is clearly a grave
incident indeed.

362
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:53,572
We will, of course, have
more information for you

363
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:54,573
as and when we get it,

364
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:58,617
but it is the sight and sound of
Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

365
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,376
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

366
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:15,897
Drivers of top stature

367
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:17,701
we've lost just in the
past four seasons

368
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:22,619
have included Piers
Courage, Jochen Rindt,

369
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,980
Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson

370
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:28,259
and today, at Watkins Glen,

371
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,653
Formula 1 has claimed
another driver.

372
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,539
The Tyrrell team have
withdrawn from the race.

373
00:23:33,652 --> 00:23:36,303
Their places on the grid
will be left empty.

374
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:38,818
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

375
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:40,577
Why?

376
00:23:40,892 --> 00:23:43,338
He made a mistake, went
into the corner too fast.

377
00:23:43,452 --> 00:23:44,863
It's his fault.

378
00:23:44,932 --> 00:23:46,821
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

379
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:48,941
Look at the tyre marks.

380
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:52,575
So says the nobody who had
to pay for his own drive.

381
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:54,332
How's that working out
for you, by the way?

382
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:57,342
Fine. How is it at the back?

383
00:23:58,252 --> 00:24:00,334
Not planning on being
there for long.

384
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:02,623
Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.

385
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:04,257
Ten minutes.

386
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,640
Asshole.

387
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:09,017
Arsehole.

388
00:24:10,412 --> 00:24:13,700
Heading into the Grand Hotel
hairpin, second gear.

389
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:14,773
Turn in hard,

390
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:17,503
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

391
00:24:19,252 --> 00:24:22,381
Heading into Portier,
second gear, clip the apex,

392
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:26,053
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

393
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:28,460
Heading through the
tunnel, gradual right,

394
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:31,502
up through third, fourth, fifth...

395
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,574
Is Alexander round?

396
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:36,698
Er, yes, he was.

397
00:24:36,772 --> 00:24:38,376
He went back to the
house to take a call.

398
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:40,216
He'll be back shortly.

399
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:42,454
He only wanted to show
me his pride and joy.

400
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:46,143
Rhymes with boy, if you ask me.

401
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:48,021
And toy.

402
00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:52,302
God, it's so flimsy for
something that costs so much.

403
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:56,377
There's no comfort, no
protection, nothing.

404
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:59,103
No, it's just a little
coffin, really.

405
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:02,221
Surrounded by high-octane
fuel in here.

406
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,216
Being driven round
170 miles per hour.

407
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:08,455
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

408
00:25:09,612 --> 00:25:11,535
You're James, aren't you?

409
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,262
Yes.

410
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:16,941
You fit the description.

411
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:18,743
Is that right?

412
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:21,940
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

413
00:25:22,052 --> 00:25:25,181
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

414
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:28,342
What was the description?

415
00:25:28,412 --> 00:25:29,973
Mostly positive, in
terms of appearance.

416
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:32,219
Negative only in
terms of character.

417
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,655
I've been told to avoid you.

418
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:36,463
By whom?

419
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:39,736
Alexander. He says
you're a bad boy.

420
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:42,099
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

421
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:44,539
I was. I'm not any more.

422
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:48,139
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

423
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:49,782
All very dull.

424
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,217
But according to the team,

425
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:53,973
the best way to keep
beating the goose-stepper.

426
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:56,452
Is that what you were
doing when I came in?

427
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,342
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

428
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:02,097
in this case Monaco,
which is up next.

429
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,452
Personally, I've
always been a great

430
00:26:08,453 --> 00:26:10,055
believer in getting
there on the day,

431
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:12,612
putting my foot down and playing
chicken with everyone else.

432
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,612
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

433
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:20,717
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

434
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,341
And what about your
soul, your heart?

435
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,574
Well, they've got ideas
about that, too.

436
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,178
They want me to stop messing
around, settle down,

437
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:31,493
get married with the
next nice girl I meet.

438
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:32,983
They think it would
be good for me.

439
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:35,454
What do you think?

440
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:39,134
It sounds fucking awful.

441
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:42,619
But since they're right
about most things,

442
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,543
they're probably right
about that, too.

443
00:26:45,612 --> 00:26:48,013
You don't fancy getting
married, do you?

444
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:14,937
Suzy.

445
00:27:15,652 --> 00:27:17,063
Bravo.

446
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:19,335
Hey, hey, hey.

447
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,815
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

448
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:26,583
Didn't want to ruin your day.

449
00:27:27,172 --> 00:27:29,573
It's the Kraut.

450
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:31,422
What about him?

451
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,135
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

452
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:37,933
You're kidding me? Jesus.
How did that happen?

453
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:39,702
Did he buy his way in there, too?

454
00:27:39,812 --> 00:27:42,708
Well, the old man
took Regazzoni back

455
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:45,376
and he insisted on it, apparently.

456
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:47,420
He says that Niki's a
genius setting up the cars.

457
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,496
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

458
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:11,699
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

459
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:14,100
- It's a Ferrari.
- It's a shitbox.

460
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:17,940
It understeers like crazy and the
weight distribution is a disaster.

461
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,597
It's amazing, all
these facilities and

462
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,061
you make a piece
of crap like this.

463
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,120
We are happy to welcome back
to the Ferrari family...

464
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,580
our good friend Clay Regazzoni,

465
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,000
and to introduce Niki Lauda,

466
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,710
from Austria.

467
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:55,695
Ferrari family. Our good
friend Clay Regazzoni.

468
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:59,254
You are family and friend to the
Commendatore as long as you win.

469
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:00,743
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

470
00:29:01,052 --> 00:29:05,182
I totally understand. It's
business. I would do the same.

471
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:08,216
But it isn't just business,
is it? What we do.

472
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,374
It's passion, love.

473
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:13,217
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

474
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,339
Not me.

475
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:15,811
If I had more talent
and could earn

476
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,133
better money with something else,

477
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,896
I would.

478
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:22,579
How do you know you will make
money here? You haven't yet.

479
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:24,973
Not yet, but I will.

480
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,541
If you can, I can.

481
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:33,255
You know, are you
ever not an asshole?

482
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:36,580
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

483
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:38,292
You know, by now I'm
both quicker than you

484
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:40,095
and better at setting up the car.

485
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:41,973
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

486
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:43,173
Screw you.

487
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:52,605
I brought you along today because

488
00:29:52,606 --> 00:29:54,301
you seem like a
lonely kind of guy.

489
00:29:54,372 --> 00:29:56,332
I thought if I introduced
you to some nice people,

490
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,141
that could rub off on you.

491
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,863
Forget it. Make your own friends.

492
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,617
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

493
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:40,577
Are you leaving?

494
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,103
Yes.

495
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:45,252
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

496
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,777
anywhere with a train station?

497
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:51,655
Sure. Trento's half
an hour's drive.

498
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:53,339
Get in.

499
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:08,139
♪ Been another blue day
without you, girl. ♪

500
00:31:09,252 --> 00:31:12,779
♪ Been another sad summer song. ♪

501
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:18,537
♪ I been thinking about you,
girl, all night long. ♪

502
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:21,573
What are you doing?

503
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:23,573
You hear that noise
when you accelerate?

504
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:26,259
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

505
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:28,056
My what?

506
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:30,533
And when you brake, your
foot goes all the way down,

507
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,132
which means there's
air in the system.

508
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:34,943
- Anything else?
- No.

509
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:38,697
Apart from the rear
brakes are worn out,

510
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,423
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

511
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:42,221
which explains why
you're weaving so much.

512
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,772
How can you tell?

513
00:31:45,132 --> 00:31:47,100
- My ass.
- Sorry?

514
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,141
God gave me an okay mind,

515
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:51,943
but a really good ass, which
can feel everything in a car.

516
00:31:52,252 --> 00:31:54,572
You don't know what you're
talking about. This car is fine.

517
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:57,303
- I just had a service a week ago.
- Not a good one.

518
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:00,023
Yes, a very good
one, very expensive.

519
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:02,654
This car is as good as new. Relax.

520
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,497
Not in a hurry, are you?

521
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:13,256
No. As long as I'm back

522
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:14,663
in Maranello Monday morning.

523
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,390
We can speak German. You're
from Vienna, aren't you?

524
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:18,392
Yes.

525
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:20,574
- Marlene.
- Niki.

526
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,070
How do you know Curd?

527
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,530
Who's Curd?

528
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,830
Curd Jürgens, the host.

529
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,370
He is, or was, my boyfriend.

530
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,830
There is something very
attractive about an older man.

531
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,500
But when they behave like
a frightened child...

532
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,380
I must have been mad.

533
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,090
Let me do this.

534
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,140
Otherwise we'll never get out of
here. We're in Italy, after all.

535
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,950
Not bad? Three seconds.
Admit it, you're impressed.

536
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:29,863
My scusi... Tu sei Niki Lauda?
Excuse me, are you Niki Lauda?

537
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,940
Yes.

538
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,851
Do you need a lift?

539
00:33:41,852 --> 00:33:43,263
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- Okay.

540
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:44,538
It's my honour, Niki, please.

541
00:33:44,612 --> 00:33:46,853
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

542
00:33:46,972 --> 00:33:50,693
On one condition, though. It's a
piece of shit. It's dog shit.

543
00:33:50,772 --> 00:33:53,855
But if you drive it, you
make my life, Niki?

544
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,570
No one will believe Niki Lauda
is driving my granny's car.

545
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,820
- Niki Lauda.
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda.

546
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:13,053
Will someone please tell
me what's going on?

547
00:34:13,132 --> 00:34:14,577
Who are you? Should I know you?

548
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,142
What, you don't know?

549
00:34:16,732 --> 00:34:20,657
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

550
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:22,222
- Him?
- Yes.

551
00:34:22,332 --> 00:34:24,539
- Impossible.
- Why?

552
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:29,180
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

553
00:34:29,212 --> 00:34:30,657
their shirts are open to here.

554
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:32,416
- Thank you.
- Yes.

555
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:35,894
Anyway, look at the way he's
driving, like an old man.

556
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:41,652
There's no need to drive fast.

557
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,934
It just increases the
percentage of risk.

558
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:46,493
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

559
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,857
Right now, with zero
incentive or reward,

560
00:34:49,932 --> 00:34:51,696
why would I drive fast?

561
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:55,534
Because I'm asking you to.

562
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,300
And do you always
get what you want?

563
00:35:01,352 --> 00:35:02,352
Yes.

564
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,090
Usually.

565
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,052
This is an incredible battle

566
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,493
between Niki Lauda
in the red Ferrari

567
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:06,098
and James Hunt in
the white Hesketh.

568
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:08,702
The challenge of Niki Lauda...

569
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:10,262
Lauda attacking Hunt.

570
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,101
Lauda gets through on the inside.

571
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,737
Goes wide at the exit.

572
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,422
Hunt is past again.

573
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:18,535
Once more Lauda tries
to sneak up the inside.

574
00:36:18,612 --> 00:36:22,617
They're absolutely side
by side, wheel to wheel.

575
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:24,805
So evenly matched.
Fantastic battle

576
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:26,742
between these two great drivers.

577
00:36:26,772 --> 00:36:29,139
Hunt is now ahead once more.

578
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:32,774
But Lauda's coming back again now.

579
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:35,254
Lauda once more
sneaks up the inside.

580
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:37,772
And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...

581
00:36:37,932 --> 00:36:41,095
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just... Just one second.

582
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:44,623
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

583
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,137
We're in the closing laps of
this race here at Watkins Glen.

584
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:49,213
They come down the hill.

585
00:36:50,932 --> 00:36:52,582
And Hunt's got a problem.

586
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:55,098
Hunt pulls across to the left.

587
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:57,976
Lauda goes ahead on his own.

588
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:02,132
A sad end to a wonderful battle.

589
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:04,823
Hunt pushing off the marshal.

590
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:17,337
The chequered flag is waiting
for Lauda and for Ferrari.

591
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,457
The title going to Niki Lauda,

592
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:22,937
who wins the race,

593
00:37:23,012 --> 00:37:25,492
who wins the World Championship.

594
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,960
Do I look like a
racing driver now?

595
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:10,302
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

596
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,497
Marlene.

597
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,992
With a car like that,
the rest of us

598
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,892
never really stood
a chance, did we?

599
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,902
Maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me.

600
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,902
Come on, Niki. You're in a
Ferrari. I'm in a Hesketh.

601
00:38:24,012 --> 00:38:25,901
Equal terms, the way
it was in Formula 3,

602
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:28,418
- I'd beat you and you know it.
- Never.

603
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:31,422
You might win one race, maybe
two, because you're aggressive.

604
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:34,735
But in the long run, over the
course of a season, no chance.

605
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:35,899
Right. Why's that?

606
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:38,903
Because to be a champion, it takes
more than just being quick.

607
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:40,736
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

608
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:42,812
You're just a charger
and a party guy.

609
00:38:42,852 --> 00:38:44,092
That's why everybody likes you.

610
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,694
Try saying that and tell
me you're not jealous.

611
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:50,737
Why would I be jealous?
Think about it.

612
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,174
All that affection,
all those smiles

613
00:38:53,252 --> 00:38:55,061
- is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

614
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:57,538
They don't fear you. Whereas
compare that to me.

615
00:38:57,612 --> 00:39:00,263
Yes, compared to you,
whom no one likes.

616
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,942
- Right.
- Not even his own team-mates.

617
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:04,777
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

618
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,293
I go to bed early, I look after
myself, look after my car.

619
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:10,461
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

620
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:13,303
And then, after the race, I go
home instead of going to bars

621
00:39:13,412 --> 00:39:16,541
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

622
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:18,455
Arseholes?

623
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,978
You should go home
more often, too.

624
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,294
I heard you got married.

625
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:28,896
Yes, I did.

626
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,058
So where is she, this
mysterious wife?

627
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:36,254
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

628
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:39,620
You know, I've never
seen you with her once.

629
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:40,892
No?

630
00:39:43,252 --> 00:39:46,142
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

631
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:50,137
on your own, looking after
yourself, being a good little boy.

632
00:39:54,332 --> 00:39:55,663
Take a drink on me, James.

633
00:39:57,572 --> 00:40:00,178
Thank you, Niki. I
might just have two.

634
00:40:11,532 --> 00:40:13,022
Right, Bubbles,

635
00:40:13,052 --> 00:40:16,181
whatever it takes to beat that
prick next year, just say it.

636
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,703
Your word is my command.

637
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:21,294
There are no lengths to which
I will not go. I mean it.

638
00:40:23,852 --> 00:40:25,695
What the hell's going on?

639
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:30,458
Where is everybody?
What's the matter?

640
00:40:36,052 --> 00:40:38,532
Do you know what
the date is today?

641
00:40:38,612 --> 00:40:41,058
Yes, it's November the 14th. Why?

642
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:45,736
Do you have any idea of the
significance of that date?

643
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:50,215
I don't know. Time to
start killing pheasants?

644
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:55,297
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

645
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,295
for the forthcoming
Formula 1 season.

646
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:58,977
Yes?

647
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:02,142
Which elapsed at midnight last
night, and we didn't attract any.

648
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:06,093
Well, so? We aren't
looking for sponsorship.

649
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,459
Like you said, condoms and
cigarettes, vulgar, right?

650
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:11,618
Right.

651
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,539
Except we are, or were.

652
00:41:18,332 --> 00:41:20,778
I've made something
of a miscalculation.

653
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:25,214
The economics, Formula
1, realities thereof.

654
00:41:26,612 --> 00:41:29,775
It turns out, not like the
lower divisions at all.

655
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,021
What are you saying?

656
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:38,412
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

657
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:42,779
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

658
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,973
Probably have to sell this place.

659
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:49,574
Oh, Christ.

660
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:33,978
I need a drive, Pete. I need
you to find me a drive.

661
00:42:34,412 --> 00:42:35,937
I mean, what about Lotus?

662
00:42:37,052 --> 00:42:38,497
You don't wanna know.

663
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:41,463
- Actually, I do.
- Okay.

664
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,814
They felt your
reputation preceded you.

665
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:47,816
And what does that mean?

666
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:52,501
It's my other line. Look,
I'll get back to you.

667
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:55,493
Peter Hunt.

668
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:57,422
Fuck.

669
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,697
Don't worry. Something
will turn up.

670
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,540
Doubt that will help
in the meantime.

671
00:43:23,492 --> 00:43:26,143
Why don't we go away
at the weekend?

672
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:29,341
Skiing. Before I go
back to New York.

673
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:36,374
Talk to me, James. Don't
make a stranger of me.

674
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:40,497
You know, Suzy, only a stranger
would invite me skiing

675
00:43:40,532 --> 00:43:42,978
when they know I haven't
got a fucking drive.

676
00:43:49,372 --> 00:43:51,136
I can't watch this.

677
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:54,213
What were you hoping for anyway?

678
00:43:54,692 --> 00:43:56,979
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

679
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:58,975
No danger of that.

680
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:01,339
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

681
00:44:01,412 --> 00:44:04,177
Don't go to men who are willing to
kill themselves driving in circles

682
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:06,903
- looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

683
00:44:07,012 --> 00:44:09,094
God knows I walked into
this with my eyes open.

684
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:10,662
I just hoped I'd married someone

685
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,815
who was half as impressive on the
inside as he is on the outside.

686
00:44:13,932 --> 00:44:15,696
At least there's something
behind the facade.

687
00:44:15,732 --> 00:44:17,939
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

688
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,413
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

689
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,256
that needs your vapid
mush to flog it.

690
00:44:59,972 --> 00:45:01,417
- Hello?
- Hi, James.

691
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:04,774
It's Peter. Something's
up at McLaren.

692
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,374
- What have you heard?
- Nothing. Why?

693
00:45:07,452 --> 00:45:09,978
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

694
00:45:10,652 --> 00:45:12,734
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

695
00:45:12,812 --> 00:45:15,213
Say anything, just
get me in that room.

696
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:21,896
I'll come straight to the point.

697
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:25,419
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

698
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:27,733
Has ditched us for another
team at the last minute.

699
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:30,133
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

700
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:31,662
ASA-fucking-P.

701
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:36,498
Fortunately, a few hands have
already gone up, good people.

702
00:45:37,332 --> 00:45:40,017
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

703
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:44,343
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

704
00:45:44,412 --> 00:45:47,859
Right, and will he go for that
gap when no one else will?

705
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:50,492
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

706
00:45:50,512 --> 00:45:51,697
The sponsors like him.

707
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,373
What do you want, a driver
or a brush salesman?

708
00:45:54,412 --> 00:45:56,332
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

709
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:58,012
But that means beating Niki Lauda,

710
00:45:58,013 --> 00:45:59,536
not being a show
pony for sponsors.

711
00:45:59,612 --> 00:46:01,137
I heard about this
thing with Niki.

712
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:02,378
Everyone has.

713
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:05,087
You really think you can beat him?

714
00:46:05,088 --> 00:46:06,212
I'd beat him in a McLaren.

715
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:09,520
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

716
00:46:09,692 --> 00:46:11,694
Which is why I'm here, begging.

717
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:13,617
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

718
00:46:13,692 --> 00:46:15,535
I'll put on a tie, I'll
smile for sponsors,

719
00:46:15,652 --> 00:46:17,541
say the right things.

720
00:46:17,852 --> 00:46:20,173
I can beat this guy, trust me.

721
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,901
Just give me the drive.

722
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:25,501
Yeah. Yeah, he can
be a loose cannon.

723
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:27,296
And, yeah, he will
drive you all mad,

724
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:30,899
but in terms of raw
talent and right stuff,

725
00:46:31,012 --> 00:46:32,901
there is no better
driver in the world.

726
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,454
He's the real thing, Teddy.

727
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:38,052
He's what we all
came into this for.

728
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:40,252
Nine days out of ten you'll
be pulling your hair out,

729
00:46:40,272 --> 00:46:43,375
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

730
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:45,693
And that is the day you will
wish you had him in your car.

731
00:46:45,713 --> 00:46:48,557
You will never win the
championship with Jacky Ickx.

732
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:51,259
You just might with James.

733
00:47:13,412 --> 00:47:15,779
Welcome to Sao Paulo, Brazil,
and the Interlagos circuit

734
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:19,533
for the first race in the
1976 Formula 1 season,

735
00:47:19,772 --> 00:47:22,935
where the main news is that James
Hunt has qualified fastest,

736
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:25,094
beating Niki Lauda's
Ferrari to pole position

737
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,943
by just two hundredths
of a second.

738
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,536
New car.

739
00:47:31,372 --> 00:47:33,022
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

740
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,383
I noticed that, too.

741
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,898
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

742
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:41,539
Yeah. Let's see where
we are after lap one.

743
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:44,422
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

744
00:47:45,252 --> 00:47:47,380
Hunt has the pit
lane pole position,

745
00:47:47,452 --> 00:47:48,977
which should give
him the best chance

746
00:47:48,978 --> 00:47:50,262
of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.

747
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:52,896
If ever there was a doubt about

748
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:56,260
whether Lauda had a serious
challenger to this season,

749
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:59,933
Hunt and his McLaren have
certainly given us the answer.

750
00:48:15,612 --> 00:48:17,137
Here in South Africa,

751
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:19,174
James Hunt is determined
to make amends

752
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:22,296
after that disastrous
retirement in Brazil.

753
00:48:23,292 --> 00:48:26,774
But it's Lauda who takes
the flag here at Kyalami.

754
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:28,502
James Hunt comes home second

755
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,018
to confirm his championship
challenge at last

756
00:48:31,092 --> 00:48:32,821
and score his first points

757
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:34,422
of the season.

758
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:38,858
That wind you can feel is me
breathing down your neck.

759
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:40,974
Next time I'll have you.

760
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,343
We'll see in Spain.

761
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:07,652
James Hunt finally takes his
first victory of the season

762
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:10,218
here in Spain, after
a brilliant drive.

763
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:12,539
It was only a matter of time.

764
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:22,702
Luca, don't you think
it's time to tell them?

765
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:31,733
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

766
00:49:32,132 --> 00:49:34,499
- What?
- You're disqualified.

767
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:36,256
How can we be disqualified?

768
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:38,181
- 1.5 centimetres.
- It's the same car.

769
00:49:38,252 --> 00:49:40,414
Giustissimo.

770
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:45,733
You fucking...

771
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:48,696
McLaren M23 has proved
very controversial here.

772
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:52,575
Just make it narrower.
I don't care how.

773
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:54,740
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

774
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:57,582
I wanna make sure this
thing is legal, no doubts.

775
00:49:57,692 --> 00:49:59,091
Well, then we'd
better move the oil

776
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:00,412
coolers back to the old position.

777
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:02,090
With the oil coolers
back, the wing brackets

778
00:50:02,091 --> 00:50:03,538
- need to be changed, too.
- Fuck.

779
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:05,740
What the fuck do you
think we're doing?

780
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,892
And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,

781
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,538
his championship year
is not going well.

782
00:50:20,612 --> 00:50:23,138
And now it's all gone
wrong here at Monaco.

783
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:25,380
His engine is smoking.

784
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:30,143
Smoke pouring from the
engine of that McLaren.

785
00:50:30,252 --> 00:50:31,697
And James Hunt is out.

786
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:34,252
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

787
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:36,454
We've taken a great car, a
great piece of engineering,

788
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:39,741
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

789
00:50:51,652 --> 00:50:53,063
Shit.

790
00:50:56,492 --> 00:50:58,779
What the hell have you
done? The car's evil.

791
00:50:58,812 --> 00:51:00,496
It's fucking undriveable.

792
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:02,639
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

793
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,732
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

794
00:51:04,752 --> 00:51:06,620
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

795
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:09,052
- They're killing us out there.
- Go and get your dick wet.

796
00:51:09,072 --> 00:51:10,621
- You're a wanker.
- Fuck you.

797
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,461
- You're a fucking wanker.
- I will, arsehole.

798
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:15,412
But this was a good
race for you, no, Niki?

799
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:16,513
It's good for everyone

800
00:51:16,612 --> 00:51:18,501
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

801
00:51:18,612 --> 00:51:21,343
James, you're 50 points behind
Lauda in the championship.

802
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:24,899
You've had another retirement
today. What's going wrong?

803
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:26,980
Oh, it's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

804
00:51:27,012 --> 00:51:28,423
that's what's going wrong.

805
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,019
So, as we approach
the halfway point

806
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:32,856
in this year's Formula 1 season,

807
00:51:33,372 --> 00:51:36,615
Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,

808
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:39,741
and James Hunt and
McLaren are struggling.

809
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:43,299
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

810
00:51:43,692 --> 00:51:46,935
It's fine. Just got a little
problem with an Austrian rat

811
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:48,622
and his team of Italian cheats

812
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:51,172
- who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

813
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:53,374
I'm talking about the
race in Spain that I won.

814
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:55,118
Yeah, in a car which is not legal.

815
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,701
Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

816
00:51:56,812 --> 00:51:59,053
You know that doesn't have the
slightest effect on speed.

817
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:00,572
But you complained
and your team of

818
00:52:00,573 --> 00:52:01,933
lawyers leaned on the authorities.

819
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,821
Now we've had to rebuild the
car, and it's become a monster.

820
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:06,269
At least it's a legal monster.

821
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,862
You've had to resort to cheating.

822
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:11,733
You're driving an illegal car and
call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

823
00:52:11,852 --> 00:52:15,061
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

824
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,213
Thank you. Thank you.

825
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:22,217
Do you really think
it upsets me, James,

826
00:52:22,252 --> 00:52:25,222
calling me a rat because
I look like one?

827
00:52:25,252 --> 00:52:26,981
I don't mind it.

828
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:28,901
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

829
00:52:28,972 --> 00:52:30,964
but they're very
intelligent and they

830
00:52:30,965 --> 00:52:32,693
have a strong survival instinct.

831
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,416
- Wonderful.
- Marlene, komm.

832
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,141
Leave this jerk alone.

833
00:52:36,142 --> 00:52:37,537
No wonder she left him.

834
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:56,902
Anyone seen Suzy?

835
00:52:58,572 --> 00:53:01,018
She's supposed to be here today.

836
00:53:01,092 --> 00:53:04,255
We, er... didn't wanna
tell you before the race.

837
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:06,782
Tell me what?

838
00:53:12,132 --> 00:53:13,577
Jesus.

839
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:39,817
Is that from him?

840
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:41,823
Yeah.

841
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,494
So when did all this start?

842
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:54,019
That weekend I went skiing.

843
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:59,099
Why have you come here, James?

844
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:01,097
I've come to get you back.

845
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:04,181
You don't want me back.

846
00:54:04,292 --> 00:54:06,252
You never wanted to be
married in the first place.

847
00:54:06,272 --> 00:54:08,593
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

848
00:54:08,932 --> 00:54:11,412
You did it because you
hoped it might change you,

849
00:54:11,492 --> 00:54:13,176
settle you down, help
with the racing.

850
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:14,943
No, I didn't.

851
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:17,294
And who knows? If it had
been just the drinking

852
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:21,132
or the dope or the
infidelity or the moods,

853
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:22,333
it might even have worked.

854
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:25,452
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

855
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:27,315
No, you're not terrible.

856
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:31,015
You're just who you are at
this point in your life.

857
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,016
God help anyone who wants more.

858
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:40,895
And Richard Burton, will
he able to give you more?

859
00:54:42,372 --> 00:54:44,818
You know, he has quite the
bad boy reputation himself.

860
00:54:45,892 --> 00:54:48,543
What's important is
how it feels to me,

861
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:50,979
and it feels like he adores me.

862
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:58,903
- James.
- New York Times.

863
00:54:58,972 --> 00:55:00,532
Are you and Suzy
getting back together?

864
00:55:00,552 --> 00:55:03,416
- James, how do you feel...
- It's all very amicable.

865
00:55:03,492 --> 00:55:06,018
My wife has found
herself a new backer...

866
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,578
I mean, lover, which
makes her happy.

867
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:11,223
And Mr Burton has found a
way of feeling young again,

868
00:55:11,252 --> 00:55:12,697
which makes him happy.

869
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:15,053
Let's hope his pockets are
deep. They'll need to be.

870
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:18,335
And I've found a way to be
single and have an ex-wife

871
00:55:18,412 --> 00:55:20,096
without it costing me a penny,

872
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:22,412
which has got to go down as
the biggest win of my career.

873
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:25,163
I have a flight to catch.

874
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:55,503
We haven't seen this
sort of intensity

875
00:56:55,532 --> 00:56:57,182
from James Hunt all season long.

876
00:56:57,212 --> 00:57:00,182
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

877
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:03,694
that their car is now fully
legal and faster than ever.

878
00:57:13,452 --> 00:57:15,580
Never mind the bloody
wets. We're still quick.

879
00:57:19,692 --> 00:57:23,094
Hunt has really closed the gap on
Lauda as they head into Druids.

880
00:57:25,252 --> 00:57:28,062
Niki Lauda is under real
pressure from James Hunt

881
00:57:28,092 --> 00:57:30,743
as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.

882
00:57:36,572 --> 00:57:38,415
And Hunt is in front of Lauda.

883
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:47,297
So James Hunt gets the plaudits

884
00:57:47,412 --> 00:57:49,221
of the crowd, the
first Briton to win

885
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:50,942
a British Grand Prix
at Brands Hatch

886
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:52,941
since Jim Clark in 1964.

887
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:58,580
James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

888
00:57:58,612 --> 00:58:01,582
over the rest of the field. How
have you achieved this advantage?

889
00:58:01,972 --> 00:58:03,576
Big balls.

890
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:05,142
Would you...

891
00:58:05,292 --> 00:58:08,262
Following an inquiry into
the disqualification

892
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:10,733
of driver James Hunt from
the Spanish Grand Prix,

893
00:58:10,852 --> 00:58:12,263
it has been decided

894
00:58:12,332 --> 00:58:13,774
to overturn this
disqualification...

895
00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:14,775
Yes.

896
00:58:14,776 --> 00:58:17,779
And to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.

897
00:58:23,972 --> 00:58:25,417
James. James.

898
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:27,452
James, a few weeks ago you
were out of the running

899
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:29,642
for the season completely, and
now you're right back in it.

900
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:30,643
What's changed?

901
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:32,256
Well, it's a combination
of factors,

902
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:34,460
not all of which I'm
prepared to discuss here,

903
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:38,816
but justice being done re the
disqualification in Spain helps,

904
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,378
and having my car back
at its best again.

905
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,820
In theory it's possible for James

906
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:46,220
Hunt to catch you.
Are you worried?

907
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,559
Not at all.

908
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,519
For him to catch me, he would
have to win a lot of races...

909
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,020
and pigs would have to fly.

910
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,280
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
a family matter to attend to.

911
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:59,982
James. James.

912
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,290
I should warn you. I'm not
going to be any good at this.

913
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,250
"Bringing flowers"
and "holding hands".

914
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,760
I'll probably forget
your birthday.

915
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:23,430
But if I'm going to
do this with anyone,

916
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,970
it might as well be you.

917
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,560
My God...

918
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,770
a poet.

919
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,920
What's the matter?

920
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,140
Happiness is the enemy.

921
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,520
It weakens you.

922
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,480
Puts doubts in your mind.

923
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:06,030
Suddenly you have
something to lose.

924
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,410
When you call happiness an enemy,

925
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,750
then it's too late.

926
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,760
Then you've already lost.

927
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:31,699
Welcome to the
legendary Nurburgring.

928
01:01:32,452 --> 01:01:34,295
This is a 14.2 miles track,

929
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:38,140
complete with 185
corners and bends.

930
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,850
An autograph?

931
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,860
With the date, please.

932
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,360
The date? Why?

933
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,570
You never know.
Could be your last.

934
01:02:37,092 --> 01:02:38,935
Welcome to the Nurburgring,

935
01:02:39,012 --> 01:02:41,618
the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.

936
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:44,742
In Formula 1 it is known
as the Graveyard.

937
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:46,581
The weather conditions
are far from ideal,

938
01:02:46,692 --> 01:02:48,262
and latest reports indicate

939
01:02:48,372 --> 01:02:50,022
there is no relief in sight.

940
01:02:54,852 --> 01:02:59,858
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

941
01:02:59,932 --> 01:03:02,094
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

942
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:03,817
Thank you.

943
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:07,935
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

944
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:10,214
the Nurburgring is the most
stupid, barbaric, outdated

945
01:03:10,252 --> 01:03:11,742
and dangerous track in the world.

946
01:03:11,772 --> 01:03:14,059
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

947
01:03:14,092 --> 01:03:16,037
Now, those of you
with experience know

948
01:03:16,038 --> 01:03:17,733
the ring needs perfect conditions

949
01:03:17,812 --> 01:03:20,463
to be even remotely
acceptable in terms of risk.

950
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:22,939
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

951
01:03:23,052 --> 01:03:26,135
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

952
01:03:26,212 --> 01:03:28,294
Cancel the race?

953
01:03:28,412 --> 01:03:30,414
There would be no
change to the situation

954
01:03:30,452 --> 01:03:31,897
as far as points is concerned.

955
01:03:31,932 --> 01:03:33,669
The race would
simply be cancelled.

956
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:34,683
This is bullshit.

957
01:03:34,684 --> 01:03:36,893
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

958
01:03:36,972 --> 01:03:39,298
That's true, you leave
without your fee,

959
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:41,341
but you might leave
with your life.

960
01:03:41,412 --> 01:03:45,656
It also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

961
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:48,618
So, I can see why this
suits you just fine.

962
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:51,583
Why? There would be no
points for me either.

963
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:54,253
No, but there would
be one race less

964
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:56,659
where I, or anyone else
here, could catch you.

965
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,019
James is right. This
is just tactics.

966
01:03:59,092 --> 01:04:01,777
Maybe he's just frightened.

967
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:04,817
Which asshole said this?

968
01:04:10,612 --> 01:04:13,661
Yes, of course I'm
frightened, and so are you.

969
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,625
I accept, every time
I get in my car,

970
01:04:17,626 --> 01:04:19,538
there is 20 per cent
chance I could die,

971
01:04:19,612 --> 01:04:21,182
and I can live with it,

972
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:23,294
but not one per cent more.

973
01:04:23,332 --> 01:04:25,653
And today, with the
rain, the risk is more.

974
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:28,503
I suppose that all depends on
how good you are in the rain.

975
01:04:28,972 --> 01:04:30,815
I have the track record here.

976
01:04:30,852 --> 01:04:32,236
I am the only person in history to

977
01:04:32,237 --> 01:04:33,742
do the ring in under
seven minutes.

978
01:04:33,812 --> 01:04:36,497
So, actually, it's to my
advantage to race here today.

979
01:04:38,132 --> 01:04:40,533
Because I'm quicker
than all of you.

980
01:04:41,572 --> 01:04:44,860
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

981
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:48,859
- Come on, Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

982
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:50,656
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

983
01:04:56,892 --> 01:04:59,543
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

984
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:11,496
All those in favour of racing.

985
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:19,337
Gentlemen, the race is on.

986
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,333
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

987
01:05:29,732 --> 01:05:32,576
You know, Niki, every now and
then it helps if people like you.

988
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:51,060
In places the track is
still dangerously wet,

989
01:05:51,092 --> 01:05:52,537
but following a drivers' meeting,

990
01:05:52,612 --> 01:05:54,137
a decision has finally been taken.

991
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,451
The Grand Prix will go ahead.

992
01:06:01,372 --> 01:06:02,578
Niki.

993
01:06:02,612 --> 01:06:04,376
One minute to go.

994
01:06:13,892 --> 01:06:17,055
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

995
01:06:17,092 --> 01:06:19,572
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

996
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:21,734
Then we stay on wets, too.

997
01:06:29,572 --> 01:06:31,336
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

998
01:06:33,812 --> 01:06:36,292
All right, fire her up.

999
01:06:49,652 --> 01:06:52,258
This season's fight for the
Formula 1 World Championship

1000
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:55,933
has so far been the
story of two men.

1001
01:06:55,972 --> 01:06:59,613
Thus far, it's been going pretty
much the way of Niki Lauda.

1002
01:06:59,652 --> 01:07:02,337
But James Hunt has
qualified fastest here.

1003
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:05,456
He is on pole position for
the German Grand Prix,

1004
01:07:05,532 --> 01:07:08,615
with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.

1005
01:07:10,052 --> 01:07:11,463
It's a long race.

1006
01:07:11,532 --> 01:07:14,183
If the track starts to dry out,

1007
01:07:14,292 --> 01:07:17,136
the wet-weather tyres will
no longer be as quick.

1008
01:07:38,572 --> 01:07:40,574
Niki Lauda and James
Hunt, side by side

1009
01:07:40,652 --> 01:07:43,815
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

1010
01:07:58,012 --> 01:08:00,219
Lauda very aggressive
on Hunt there,

1011
01:08:00,332 --> 01:08:02,334
forcing the McLaren
onto the grass.

1012
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:08,103
Lauda has the lead at the moment.

1013
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:10,539
Lauda leads into the first corner.

1014
01:08:10,732 --> 01:08:12,700
Hunt is in second place.

1015
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:19,943
Mass storming past Hunt.

1016
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,697
He made the right choice to go
with the dry-weather tyres.

1017
01:08:24,212 --> 01:08:26,021
Mass passing Lauda now.

1018
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:30,057
Jochen Mass, in the number
12 McLaren, takes the lead.

1019
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:31,896
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

1020
01:08:32,052 --> 01:08:34,100
with everybody else
making the decision

1021
01:08:34,212 --> 01:08:36,294
to change tyres after just
one lap of this race.

1022
01:08:36,372 --> 01:08:38,579
He's coming in. Come on, let's go.

1023
01:08:46,732 --> 01:08:50,782
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

1024
01:08:50,892 --> 01:08:52,656
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

1025
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:55,417
Behind you. He made
the same mistake.

1026
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:09,901
Come on.

1027
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,261
Come on. What's going on?

1028
01:09:15,772 --> 01:09:17,531
The tyre-changing
frenzy has caused

1029
01:09:17,532 --> 01:09:19,094
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

1030
01:09:19,132 --> 01:09:21,041
with Jochen Mass in the lead now.

1031
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:22,102
You're clear. Go.

1032
01:09:22,652 --> 01:09:23,778
Quick.

1033
01:09:25,252 --> 01:09:27,016
Lauda urging his
mechanics to hurry.

1034
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:28,253
Quicker, quicker, quicker.

1035
01:09:30,012 --> 01:09:32,094
It's a disaster. Come on.

1036
01:09:43,652 --> 01:09:45,222
What's going on, you assholes?

1037
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:11,134
This race has gone
wrong for him so far.

1038
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:14,659
His championship rival, James
Hunt, is a long way up the road.

1039
01:10:25,532 --> 01:10:26,977
Lauda passing car after car.

1040
01:10:27,012 --> 01:10:30,494
He's just going past Mario
Andretti's Lotus there.

1041
01:11:17,212 --> 01:11:19,214
Niki.

1042
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:26,294
Get me out. Help me.

1043
01:11:26,892 --> 01:11:29,452
We have an accident on the
course. Red flags are out.

1044
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:31,766
Several cars are
involved. Looks like

1045
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,532
it might be one of the Ferraris.

1046
01:11:40,732 --> 01:11:43,099
- Come this way.
- Come on, come on.

1047
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:56,743
Keep trying.

1048
01:12:04,412 --> 01:12:06,052
- Come this way.
- Okay.

1049
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:15,396
News is reaching
us that Niki Lauda

1050
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:18,410
was involved in the accident.

1051
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:21,309
He is being flown by helicopter to

1052
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:24,460
Mannheim hospital
with severe burns.

1053
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:02,200
It's not the burns to his
face that are the danger.

1054
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,080
It's the burns to his lungs.

1055
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:10,585
In the intensive care
unit, six doctors and

1056
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,090
thirty-four nurses
are on duty for him.

1057
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,590
But his condition is far worse
than originally feared.

1058
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:47,779
The flood, which swept down Big
Thompson Canyon in Colorado,

1059
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:49,536
was the worst since records began.

1060
01:13:49,572 --> 01:13:52,098
In Formula 1 today, victory
celebrations were muted

1061
01:13:52,172 --> 01:13:54,324
after a horrific
accident involving

1062
01:13:54,325 --> 01:13:55,938
world champion Niki Lauda.

1063
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:57,935
Due to safety concerns
before the race,

1064
01:13:58,012 --> 01:14:00,379
the Austrian had said
he would not take part,

1065
01:14:00,412 --> 01:14:01,902
but in the end he did.

1066
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:05,579
He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,

1067
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:08,059
puncturing the
Ferrari's fuel tank.

1068
01:14:08,452 --> 01:14:10,739
Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,

1069
01:14:10,892 --> 01:14:13,816
but was unhurt and joined with the
other drivers to rescue Lauda,

1070
01:14:13,892 --> 01:14:16,782
who was taken to Mannheim
Hospital with severe burns,

1071
01:14:16,892 --> 01:14:20,533
the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.

1072
01:14:20,652 --> 01:14:22,654
Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute

1073
01:14:22,732 --> 01:14:25,383
in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.

1074
01:14:34,212 --> 01:14:35,867
Do we have any
change this morning?

1075
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:36,868
No...

1076
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:38,415
Frau Lauda. Frau Lauda?

1077
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,470
He's awake and just spoke.

1078
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:46,600
He said, "Tell the priest to
fuck off. I'm still alive."

1079
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:48,430
You can go in.

1080
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:14,770
James Hunt gains on the
absent Niki Lauda.

1081
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,780
We need to vacuum the lungs.

1082
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,570
I should warn you.
It won't be easy.

1083
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,940
Do it again.

1084
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:42,320
Are you sure? The lungs
will already be bruised.

1085
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,360
Please, stop.

1086
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,910
I know what you're
thinking, but please...

1087
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:35,540
If you love me, you
won't say a word.

1088
01:19:12,172 --> 01:19:14,061
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1089
01:19:14,252 --> 01:19:15,902
Looking good.

1090
01:19:19,132 --> 01:19:21,942
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1091
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:24,060
- What about him?
- He's here.

1092
01:19:24,372 --> 01:19:25,897
- What?
- He's racing.

1093
01:19:41,252 --> 01:19:42,902
Niki.

1094
01:19:49,532 --> 01:19:51,057
It's that bad, huh?

1095
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:53,783
No.

1096
01:19:54,652 --> 01:19:57,576
In hospital I asked them
straight, no bullshit,

1097
01:19:57,652 --> 01:19:59,495
how bad my appearance would be.

1098
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:03,099
They said with time
it would be fine.

1099
01:20:03,972 --> 01:20:05,576
But it won't.

1100
01:20:06,492 --> 01:20:09,336
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

1101
01:20:10,292 --> 01:20:13,296
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

1102
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,321
You know, Niki, I
tried to write you

1103
01:20:19,322 --> 01:20:21,178
a letter at the
time, to apologise.

1104
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:25,292
The drivers' meeting in
Germany, before the race.

1105
01:20:25,412 --> 01:20:27,938
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1106
01:20:28,132 --> 01:20:30,339
That race should never
have gone ahead.

1107
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,696
No, it shouldn't.

1108
01:20:33,132 --> 01:20:35,270
So, in many ways, I
feel responsible

1109
01:20:35,271 --> 01:20:36,773
for what happened, and...

1110
01:20:36,852 --> 01:20:38,422
You were.

1111
01:20:40,092 --> 01:20:41,821
But, trust me...

1112
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:47,022
watching you win those races while
I was fighting for my life...

1113
01:20:49,332 --> 01:20:52,541
you were equally responsible for
getting me back in the car.

1114
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,977
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1115
01:21:23,372 --> 01:21:25,401
Niki, can you confirm
to us exactly

1116
01:21:25,402 --> 01:21:26,979
which procedures you've had

1117
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:29,014
and the expectations
for your recovery?

1118
01:21:29,572 --> 01:21:31,017
Sure.

1119
01:21:31,172 --> 01:21:32,981
I had a skin graft operation,

1120
01:21:33,012 --> 01:21:35,333
where they put half my
right thigh in my face.

1121
01:21:37,532 --> 01:21:42,333
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

1122
01:21:42,372 --> 01:21:44,659
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1123
01:21:44,732 --> 01:21:46,463
so sweat will never
run into my eyes

1124
01:21:46,464 --> 01:21:48,100
again, which is good for a driver.

1125
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,022
When they heard about
your condition,

1126
01:21:52,052 --> 01:21:53,462
Ferrari immediately hired a

1127
01:21:53,463 --> 01:21:55,499
replacement driver,
Carlos Reutemann.

1128
01:21:56,172 --> 01:22:00,177
Yeah, before even
reaching the hospital.

1129
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:02,260
Is Reutemann driving today, too?

1130
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:05,696
Yes, and keen to
make an impression.

1131
01:22:05,892 --> 01:22:09,863
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

1132
01:22:11,412 --> 01:22:14,097
James Hunt and McLaren have caught
up a lot while you were away.

1133
01:22:14,732 --> 01:22:16,222
Yes.

1134
01:22:16,852 --> 01:22:19,776
So is there a question now, or are
you just trying to piss me off?

1135
01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:24,861
You still think you can win?

1136
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:27,056
Yes, of course.

1137
01:22:27,092 --> 01:22:29,094
I have the better car.

1138
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:31,692
And possibly I'm
the better driver.

1139
01:22:31,892 --> 01:22:34,293
But he's a clever guy, and
he's used his time well

1140
01:22:34,372 --> 01:22:38,422
while I was lying half-dead in
hospital to win some points.

1141
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:43,057
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1142
01:22:49,252 --> 01:22:52,734
She said, Sweetie, you don't
need a face to drive.

1143
01:22:52,812 --> 01:22:54,940
You just need a right foot.

1144
01:22:55,252 --> 01:22:57,619
I'm being serious.

1145
01:22:57,812 --> 01:23:00,146
Do you really think
your marriage can

1146
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,295
survive with the way you look now?

1147
01:23:04,932 --> 01:23:06,980
And I'm being serious, too.

1148
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:10,942
Fuck you. Press conference over.

1149
01:23:16,132 --> 01:23:18,052
- That was hairy.
- Well, you got noticed, Clive.

1150
01:23:18,072 --> 01:23:19,258
I'll tell you that.

1151
01:23:19,332 --> 01:23:20,936
I thought it went
well, to be honest.

1152
01:23:21,012 --> 01:23:22,932
They don't like it when
it's not going their way.

1153
01:23:22,952 --> 01:23:24,496
- Clive.
- That's the game.

1154
01:23:24,612 --> 01:23:26,853
- See you.
- See you later.

1155
01:23:26,932 --> 01:23:28,821
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1156
01:23:28,932 --> 01:23:30,616
Listen, I think I've
got something for you

1157
01:23:30,692 --> 01:23:32,456
on that last question, about Niki.

1158
01:23:32,492 --> 01:23:35,098
- You heard about that?
- I did.

1159
01:23:36,332 --> 01:23:38,061
James.

1160
01:23:44,292 --> 01:23:46,863
Please, James...

1161
01:23:47,852 --> 01:23:50,776
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1162
01:23:53,212 --> 01:23:54,623
Prick.

1163
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:13,998
So Niki Lauda, just
42 days after his

1164
01:24:13,999 --> 01:24:16,373
near-fatal accident
at Nurburgring,

1165
01:24:16,492 --> 01:24:17,982
will race here today at Monza

1166
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:21,818
against all medical advice and
no doubt in incredible pain.

1167
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:56,182
Niki Lauda.

1168
01:25:04,892 --> 01:25:07,293
Photographers, please
clear the grid.

1169
01:25:07,532 --> 01:25:09,694
Niki, it's time.

1170
01:25:11,212 --> 01:25:12,702
Okay?

1171
01:25:19,372 --> 01:25:20,783
Please clear the grid.

1172
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:25,540
One minute to go.

1173
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:06,570
That's a bad start for
Lauda, he's slow away.

1174
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,176
The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.

1175
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:16,698
He's being overtaken
by car after car.

1176
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,249
A terrible start for the Austrian.

1177
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,590
It's perhaps too soon for
him to be racing again.

1178
01:26:26,492 --> 01:26:29,621
Lauda's off line. He runs
wide onto the grass.

1179
01:26:34,452 --> 01:26:36,136
He wrestles it back
onto the track,

1180
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:39,142
but that was a bad
moment for Niki.

1181
01:26:43,012 --> 01:26:45,219
Niki Lauda's the
reigning world champion,

1182
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:48,501
but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,

1183
01:26:48,652 --> 01:26:51,462
to himself and to the
rest of the field.

1184
01:26:53,452 --> 01:26:57,343
And Stuck has collided with
Mario Andretti's Lotus.

1185
01:26:57,492 --> 01:27:00,655
Niki's boxed in. He's
got nowhere to go.

1186
01:27:15,092 --> 01:27:18,653
Niki Lauda is actually making a
move. He's on Brambilla's tail.

1187
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:24,583
He pulls out of the
slipstream to overtake.

1188
01:27:25,332 --> 01:27:27,653
Lauda's starting to find the form

1189
01:27:27,772 --> 01:27:29,740
that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.

1190
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:38,007
Lauda's now lapping faster than

1191
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:40,257
Reutemann and closing
the gap ahead.

1192
01:27:44,172 --> 01:27:46,743
Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,

1193
01:27:46,852 --> 01:27:50,015
the man called in to be his
replacement in the Ferrari team.

1194
01:27:59,052 --> 01:28:00,861
And there's James Hunt's McLaren,

1195
01:28:00,972 --> 01:28:03,418
smoking stationary by
the side of the road.

1196
01:28:07,052 --> 01:28:10,135
This is bad news for
Hunt's championship hopes.

1197
01:28:14,532 --> 01:28:15,943
It's Ronnie Peterson

1198
01:28:16,052 --> 01:28:18,419
who comes home the
winner here at Monza.

1199
01:28:18,612 --> 01:28:21,502
But all eyes are on the man who
finishes a brilliant fourth,

1200
01:28:22,452 --> 01:28:24,580
Niki Lauda.

1201
01:29:05,452 --> 01:29:07,773
What a race, what a
man, what a season.

1202
01:29:07,852 --> 01:29:10,014
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

1203
01:29:10,092 --> 01:29:12,094
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1204
01:29:12,132 --> 01:29:14,339
to retaining the
World Championship.

1205
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:17,019
So, the long, gruelling and
incredibly dramatic season

1206
01:30:17,052 --> 01:30:19,419
comes down to this
final race in Japan

1207
01:30:19,492 --> 01:30:22,018
in the shadow of Mount Fuji.

1208
01:30:22,092 --> 01:30:23,537
Niki Lauda goes into

1209
01:30:23,572 --> 01:30:25,017
this deciding race at Fuji

1210
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,254
just three points
ahead of James Hunt.

1211
01:30:27,332 --> 01:30:29,592
Hunt knowing he must
beat the Austrian

1212
01:30:29,593 --> 01:30:31,621
fair and square to take the title.

1213
01:30:33,172 --> 01:30:36,699
James, do you think you can
cope with the pressure?

1214
01:30:36,732 --> 01:30:40,259
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

1215
01:30:40,372 --> 01:30:42,420
I love competing. I love racing.

1216
01:30:42,612 --> 01:30:44,455
Maybe you should ask Niki.

1217
01:30:44,532 --> 01:30:46,853
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

1218
01:30:46,892 --> 01:30:49,213
Mr Lauda, are you
feeling pressure?

1219
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:51,738
Do I look like I'm
feeling pressure?

1220
01:30:53,812 --> 01:30:56,054
I am World Champion,
and on the verge

1221
01:30:56,055 --> 01:30:57,942
to become World Champion again.

1222
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:00,054
Hunt now has the
opportunity to win,

1223
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:02,214
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1224
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:05,421
You have to really believe
it to make it possible.

1225
01:31:05,572 --> 01:31:07,620
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1226
01:31:07,732 --> 01:31:09,775
If Niki is being
tricky and getting a

1227
01:31:09,776 --> 01:31:11,657
kicky out of playing mind games...

1228
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:14,099
then fine, I'm flattered.

1229
01:31:14,212 --> 01:31:17,773
But the fact is, momentum is
with me. I've never felt better.

1230
01:31:17,892 --> 01:31:20,463
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1231
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:22,734
will be with me as World Champion.

1232
01:31:24,572 --> 01:31:27,018
How will you cope with the
weather, bad conditions?

1233
01:31:27,092 --> 01:31:30,574
Intermittent heavy rain has been
forecast here at Fuji today,

1234
01:31:30,652 --> 01:31:34,134
along with strong winds
and occasional fog

1235
01:31:34,252 --> 01:31:36,141
rolling in from the mountain.

1236
01:31:37,932 --> 01:31:40,583
And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,

1237
01:31:40,652 --> 01:31:42,416
Lauda's lead a mere three points.

1238
01:31:42,492 --> 01:31:44,176
What a way to finish the season.

1239
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:46,262
Hunt or Lauda?

1240
01:31:46,332 --> 01:31:47,774
Well, the final
chapter will unfold

1241
01:31:47,775 --> 01:31:49,336
when we bring you
extended coverage...

1242
01:31:49,452 --> 01:31:52,501
They've got to cancel the
race. It's lethal out there.

1243
01:31:52,572 --> 01:31:54,700
The race is going ahead.

1244
01:31:54,772 --> 01:31:56,892
Television rights have been
sold all around the world.

1245
01:31:56,912 --> 01:31:59,343
The showdown between you and
Niki is all anyone wants to see.

1246
01:31:59,412 --> 01:32:02,814
With heavy rain continuing
to fall here at Fuji,

1247
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,974
a decision has finally been made.

1248
01:32:05,092 --> 01:32:09,017
The 1976 Japanese Grand
Prix will go ahead.

1249
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:11,777
All drivers to your cars, please.

1250
01:32:36,412 --> 01:32:37,823
Five minutes to go.

1251
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,457
- All right?
- All right.

1252
01:33:22,532 --> 01:33:24,853
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1253
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,661
To let the condensation out.

1254
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:29,463
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1255
01:33:29,532 --> 01:33:31,899
Trust me, this race is
all about the start.

1256
01:33:33,812 --> 01:33:36,383
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1257
01:33:50,852 --> 01:33:52,502
Okay, start the bastard.

1258
01:33:55,492 --> 01:33:57,142
Good luck, kid.

1259
01:33:58,532 --> 01:33:59,943
Good luck, James.

1260
01:34:39,492 --> 01:34:41,494
Thirty seconds to go.

1261
01:35:00,932 --> 01:35:03,094
Electric tension here at Fuji.

1262
01:35:03,172 --> 01:35:05,727
80,000 bedraggled
race fans and the

1263
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,212
racing grudge match of the decade.

1264
01:35:08,292 --> 01:35:10,420
And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,

1265
01:35:10,492 --> 01:35:12,494
James Hunt alongside him.

1266
01:35:14,652 --> 01:35:16,575
On Row 2 of the grid,

1267
01:35:16,652 --> 01:35:18,541
there is Niki Lauda,

1268
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:21,058
and on Row 3 of the grid, Jody
Scheckter from South Africa

1269
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:22,577
in the six-wheel Tyrrell.

1270
01:35:22,652 --> 01:35:24,734
Behind him, the rest
of the 25-car field.

1271
01:35:42,572 --> 01:35:46,577
There's the flag, and finally the
Japanese Grand Prix is underway.

1272
01:35:58,812 --> 01:36:01,975
In these conditions, it must
be almost impossible to drive

1273
01:36:02,052 --> 01:36:04,054
a 450-horsepower car.

1274
01:36:31,212 --> 01:36:34,216
And it's Andretti who has the
lead, but Hunt is attacking.

1275
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:37,262
Hunt's going round the
outside of Andretti.

1276
01:36:37,332 --> 01:36:38,902
Niki Lauda following him through.

1277
01:36:38,972 --> 01:36:41,737
Hunt leads into the
first right-hander.

1278
01:37:24,812 --> 01:37:26,572
Hunt comes through to
complete his first lap,

1279
01:37:26,612 --> 01:37:28,023
leading the field.

1280
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:30,220
At least he has clear
vision in front of him.

1281
01:37:30,332 --> 01:37:32,494
Niki Lauda, behind
him, eating his spray.

1282
01:37:51,972 --> 01:37:53,383
Lauda is slowing.

1283
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:56,342
Niki Lauda is bringing the
Ferrari number one into the pit.

1284
01:37:58,092 --> 01:37:59,529
Some sort of problem, we can't

1285
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:01,301
imagine what, so
early in the race.

1286
01:38:07,612 --> 01:38:11,059
What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

1287
01:38:12,212 --> 01:38:13,941
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

1288
01:38:14,292 --> 01:38:16,374
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1289
01:38:20,772 --> 01:38:23,139
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

1290
01:38:23,212 --> 01:38:25,374
His mechanics are asking
what the problem is.

1291
01:38:25,452 --> 01:38:27,773
But wait. Niki Lauda's
getting out of the car.

1292
01:38:27,892 --> 01:38:29,496
This is sensational.

1293
01:38:29,572 --> 01:38:32,496
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

1294
01:38:33,412 --> 01:38:35,096
It's too dangerous.

1295
01:38:35,172 --> 01:38:36,777
Niki, you want me
to say there was a

1296
01:38:36,778 --> 01:38:38,381
problem with the
car, for the media?

1297
01:38:39,692 --> 01:38:41,182
No.

1298
01:38:41,572 --> 01:38:42,983
Tell them the truth.

1299
01:38:43,852 --> 01:38:45,422
Now, what is happening?

1300
01:38:45,532 --> 01:38:47,766
They're talking to
the team manager.

1301
01:38:47,767 --> 01:38:49,457
Lauda explaining something.

1302
01:39:05,012 --> 01:39:08,300
With Lauda out, James Hunt knows
he has to finish this race

1303
01:39:08,372 --> 01:39:12,138
in third place or higher
to be World Champion.

1304
01:39:12,212 --> 01:39:14,897
But the job's not done
yet for James Hunt.

1305
01:39:14,972 --> 01:39:19,580
In these dreadful conditions, he
still has to go the distance.

1306
01:39:20,692 --> 01:39:22,535
Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.

1307
01:39:22,652 --> 01:39:24,734
James Hunt or Niki Lauda?

1308
01:39:24,812 --> 01:39:27,895
This extraordinary
season is not over yet.

1309
01:39:27,972 --> 01:39:31,419
In this treacherous final
round, can James Hunt hang on?

1310
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:33,775
And the scoreboard tells a story.

1311
01:39:33,852 --> 01:39:36,662
Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.

1312
01:39:38,652 --> 01:39:40,495
Oh, God, his tyres,
they're blistering.

1313
01:39:42,132 --> 01:39:43,896
Brambilla very close behind now,

1314
01:39:43,972 --> 01:39:45,940
closing on him all the time now.

1315
01:39:46,052 --> 01:39:49,215
And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.

1316
01:39:49,292 --> 01:39:51,818
Hunt cuts across the
orange March nose.

1317
01:39:51,932 --> 01:39:54,219
Hunt's not having that at
all. And he's spinning.

1318
01:39:54,292 --> 01:39:57,455
He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race

1319
01:39:57,532 --> 01:39:59,899
and out of the world championship.

1320
01:39:59,972 --> 01:40:02,703
Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.

1321
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:09,220
Mario Andretti's going past Hunt.

1322
01:40:09,692 --> 01:40:12,696
Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.

1323
01:40:18,532 --> 01:40:20,296
Despite these wet conditions,

1324
01:40:20,372 --> 01:40:22,212
these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.

1325
01:40:22,232 --> 01:40:24,360
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

1326
01:40:24,572 --> 01:40:28,258
Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.

1327
01:40:30,252 --> 01:40:32,300
That back marker's
going past Hunt.

1328
01:40:44,732 --> 01:40:47,417
Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.

1329
01:40:47,492 --> 01:40:50,655
No tread on it at all. And
the other one is flat.

1330
01:40:50,812 --> 01:40:52,940
Let's go. Let's go.

1331
01:40:57,492 --> 01:40:59,893
Okay? When did you
break your gear lever?

1332
01:40:59,972 --> 01:41:01,576
Nine or ten laps ago.

1333
01:41:01,652 --> 01:41:04,098
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on.

1334
01:41:04,212 --> 01:41:05,896
- At the front.
- Let's go.

1335
01:41:05,972 --> 01:41:09,181
Regazzoni's Ferrari and
Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier

1336
01:41:09,252 --> 01:41:10,902
have gone ahead.

1337
01:41:11,012 --> 01:41:12,616
Come on, hurry.

1338
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:15,741
You did it. You're going
to be World Champion.

1339
01:41:15,812 --> 01:41:17,257
Not yet.

1340
01:41:17,332 --> 01:41:21,098
A few laps ago, James Hunt was
looking like champion elect.

1341
01:41:21,172 --> 01:41:23,539
Now it looks as though it's
all gone wrong for him.

1342
01:41:24,972 --> 01:41:26,383
- James.
- Come on.

1343
01:41:26,452 --> 01:41:27,897
- Listen.
- What?

1344
01:41:27,972 --> 01:41:30,213
Just go easy out there.

1345
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:34,263
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1346
01:41:34,332 --> 01:41:36,221
We want you back in one piece.

1347
01:41:36,292 --> 01:41:39,660
You're too far back. There's too
many drivers in front of you.

1348
01:41:39,732 --> 01:41:43,737
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1349
01:41:44,132 --> 01:41:45,622
Clear.

1350
01:41:45,692 --> 01:41:47,217
James.

1351
01:41:48,892 --> 01:41:50,815
- Clear.
- Fuck it.

1352
01:41:54,732 --> 01:41:57,975
James Hunt rejoins the
race in sixth position.

1353
01:41:58,052 --> 01:41:59,800
There are four laps left to go.

1354
01:41:59,801 --> 01:42:01,943
Surely no way back
for the Brit now.

1355
01:42:21,812 --> 01:42:23,052
Concentrate, Superstar.

1356
01:42:23,252 --> 01:42:24,936
Just brings it back under control.

1357
01:42:25,052 --> 01:42:26,258
Sliding the McLaren

1358
01:42:26,332 --> 01:42:27,572
on the very edge there.

1359
01:42:29,492 --> 01:42:30,778
Hunt's M23

1360
01:42:30,892 --> 01:42:32,532
twitching this way and
that under braking.

1361
01:42:32,572 --> 01:42:33,972
And he almost loses
it right there.

1362
01:42:34,092 --> 01:42:36,813
Hunt on the tail of Jacques
Lafitte in the blue Ligier.

1363
01:42:44,772 --> 01:42:46,183
Oh, don't do it, James.

1364
01:42:49,612 --> 01:42:51,182
He's inches away
from the pit wall.

1365
01:42:51,252 --> 01:42:53,061
He's inches away from the Ligier.

1366
01:43:02,092 --> 01:43:04,493
James Hunt has made
up another place,

1367
01:43:04,572 --> 01:43:05,573
but it's not enough,

1368
01:43:05,652 --> 01:43:06,892
and this race is running out.

1369
01:43:15,932 --> 01:43:17,934
And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.

1370
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:25,337
Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker

1371
01:43:25,412 --> 01:43:27,414
and the stationary Penske.

1372
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:29,494
He's catching Regazzoni

1373
01:43:29,572 --> 01:43:31,652
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

1374
01:43:31,672 --> 01:43:33,879
it's quite another to overtake.

1375
01:43:36,892 --> 01:43:39,047
He's alongside Clay
Regazzoni. This

1376
01:43:39,048 --> 01:43:41,022
could be the world championship.

1377
01:43:49,452 --> 01:43:50,977
He's got him.

1378
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:54,470
The scoreboard still
shows Hunt in 5th place.

1379
01:44:06,252 --> 01:44:08,334
Hunt crosses the line.

1380
01:44:08,412 --> 01:44:10,310
Now, he needed to
finish third to score

1381
01:44:10,311 --> 01:44:12,019
enough points to
be World Champion,

1382
01:44:12,092 --> 01:44:14,385
and in the confusion
here, we're being

1383
01:44:14,386 --> 01:44:16,620
told that he may
have finished fifth.

1384
01:44:16,692 --> 01:44:18,820
He finished fifth?

1385
01:44:18,892 --> 01:44:21,702
Our lap charts show
Hunt in third place.

1386
01:44:21,772 --> 01:44:23,695
Well, if the scoreboard's right,

1387
01:44:23,772 --> 01:44:26,298
it means he's just missed
out on the championship.

1388
01:44:26,372 --> 01:44:30,013
Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.

1389
01:44:33,972 --> 01:44:36,498
I can see the race
stewards conferring,

1390
01:44:36,572 --> 01:44:38,222
examining the official lap charts.

1391
01:44:38,292 --> 01:44:40,693
We're just going to have to
wait for their verdict here.

1392
01:44:58,332 --> 01:44:59,902
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

1393
01:44:59,942 --> 01:45:00,942
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry. I

1394
01:45:00,943 --> 01:45:02,139
thought I could
make up the ground.

1395
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:04,214
Sorry? What are you talking
about? You did it.

1396
01:45:04,292 --> 01:45:07,057
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

1397
01:45:07,132 --> 01:45:08,882
You came third. You
got the points.

1398
01:45:08,883 --> 01:45:10,341
You're champion of the world.

1399
01:45:10,852 --> 01:45:14,095
James Hunt is now
officially confirmed

1400
01:45:14,212 --> 01:45:16,260
as finishing third here in Japan,

1401
01:45:16,892 --> 01:45:20,533
and that means he is
champion of the world.

1402
01:45:22,012 --> 01:45:27,303
Our new World Champion, James
Hunt, by just one single point.

1403
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:33,982
Did we really win?

1404
01:45:38,052 --> 01:45:40,293
World bloody Champion.

1405
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:50,981
Tell us, James, what are
you going to do now?

1406
01:45:51,052 --> 01:45:53,214
I shall be getting drunk.

1407
01:45:53,732 --> 01:45:56,463
It's wonderful, an
absolute dream...

1408
01:46:09,690 --> 01:46:11,360
Are you okay?

1409
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,990
Fine.

1410
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:18,360
No regrets.

1411
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,450
Not one.

1412
01:46:43,452 --> 01:46:45,454
And our special guest,

1413
01:46:45,532 --> 01:46:47,375
Formula 1 champion James Hunt.

1414
01:47:10,772 --> 01:47:12,854
Wait. Come on.

1415
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:17,502
There's no better motor oil

1416
01:47:17,572 --> 01:47:19,176
than Havoline.

1417
01:47:29,692 --> 01:47:31,615
Yes, me, too. Where are we going?

1418
01:47:31,692 --> 01:47:33,182
Anywhere I want to go.

1419
01:47:33,252 --> 01:47:35,533
And I don't have to
hijack it, either.

1420
01:47:35,572 --> 01:47:37,222
As long as I pay for it.

1421
01:47:37,292 --> 01:47:39,613
I'm starving. Let's get some food.

1422
01:47:50,732 --> 01:47:52,461
- Where are we going?
- You lot go ahead.

1423
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:54,500
I won't be a minute.

1424
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:02,016
Good to see you.

1425
01:48:06,092 --> 01:48:08,493
I heard you were spending more
and more time in one of these.

1426
01:48:08,892 --> 01:48:10,860
- Do you fly?
- No.

1427
01:48:11,252 --> 01:48:12,742
I don't think they'd insure me.

1428
01:48:12,892 --> 01:48:14,735
You should try. It's
good for discipline.

1429
01:48:14,932 --> 01:48:17,412
You have to stay within the
rules, stick to regulations,

1430
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:20,103
suppress the ego. It
helps with the racing.

1431
01:48:20,212 --> 01:48:23,182
And there I was thinking you
were about to wax lyrical

1432
01:48:23,252 --> 01:48:24,856
about the romance of flight.

1433
01:48:25,212 --> 01:48:26,782
No, that's all bullshit.

1434
01:48:27,932 --> 01:48:29,377
So, what brings you here?

1435
01:48:30,532 --> 01:48:33,012
A friend's wedding. At least
I think it was a wedding.

1436
01:48:33,092 --> 01:48:34,323
Might have been a birthday or

1437
01:48:34,324 --> 01:48:35,936
something. It's all
a bit of a blur.

1438
01:48:36,012 --> 01:48:37,612
How about you? Have
you been at Fiorano?

1439
01:48:37,632 --> 01:48:38,632
Pre-season testing.

1440
01:48:38,633 --> 01:48:40,535
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1441
01:48:40,612 --> 01:48:42,774
I'm not sure that was
meant as a compliment.

1442
01:48:42,852 --> 01:48:45,139
When do you start
testing? Next week?

1443
01:48:45,172 --> 01:48:47,140
No. What, are you nuts?

1444
01:48:47,212 --> 01:48:49,012
I didn't just win the
biggest thing of my life

1445
01:48:49,032 --> 01:48:50,477
so I could get right back to work.

1446
01:48:51,772 --> 01:48:54,457
Why? You have to.

1447
01:48:54,772 --> 01:48:56,410
To prove to all the
people who will

1448
01:48:56,411 --> 01:48:58,140
always say you just
won it because...

1449
01:48:58,212 --> 01:49:01,614
Because of what? Because
of your accident?

1450
01:49:03,132 --> 01:49:05,180
Niki, is that other
people, or is that you?

1451
01:49:05,812 --> 01:49:08,895
I won, okay? On the all-important
day, when it came down to it,

1452
01:49:08,972 --> 01:49:11,816
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1453
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:14,054
And I put my life on the
line, and I saw it through.

1454
01:49:14,132 --> 01:49:16,180
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1455
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:18,374
The risks were totally
unacceptable.

1456
01:49:18,892 --> 01:49:21,372
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1457
01:49:21,492 --> 01:49:23,062
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1458
01:49:23,132 --> 01:49:25,976
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1459
01:49:26,012 --> 01:49:28,982
And that's the effect you have
on me. You'd pushed me that far.

1460
01:49:29,092 --> 01:49:30,503
And it felt great.

1461
01:49:31,412 --> 01:49:33,733
I mean, hell, isn't that
what we're in this for?

1462
01:49:33,812 --> 01:49:37,180
To stare death in the
face and to cheat it?

1463
01:49:37,532 --> 01:49:41,332
Come on, there's nobility in
that. It's like being knights.

1464
01:49:42,332 --> 01:49:44,096
You English, you're such assholes.

1465
01:49:45,052 --> 01:49:46,497
You know my position.

1466
01:49:46,772 --> 01:49:48,183
Twenty per cent risk.

1467
01:49:48,252 --> 01:49:49,954
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the

1468
01:49:49,955 --> 01:49:52,018
percentages into this.
Don't be a pro.

1469
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:54,703
The minute you do that, you
kill what's good about this.

1470
01:49:55,012 --> 01:49:56,776
You kill the sport.

1471
01:49:59,892 --> 01:50:01,542
James.

1472
01:50:01,852 --> 01:50:03,695
- James.
- Come on.

1473
01:50:06,692 --> 01:50:08,057
I've got to go.

1474
01:50:09,572 --> 01:50:11,540
Careful in this thing.

1475
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:14,062
James.

1476
01:50:19,292 --> 01:50:21,149
You know, in hospital,
the toughest

1477
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:23,058
part of my treatment
was the vacuum.

1478
01:50:23,372 --> 01:50:26,296
Pumping the shit out of
my lungs. It was hell.

1479
01:50:27,372 --> 01:50:29,295
And while doing it, I was
watching television.

1480
01:50:29,892 --> 01:50:32,657
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1481
01:50:32,732 --> 01:50:34,939
That bastard Hunt, I would
say. I hate that guy.

1482
01:50:35,492 --> 01:50:37,574
And then one day the
doctor came and said,

1483
01:50:37,652 --> 01:50:39,939
Mr Lauda, may I offer
a piece of advice?

1484
01:50:40,052 --> 01:50:43,738
Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life.

1485
01:50:43,812 --> 01:50:45,974
It can be a blessing, too.

1486
01:50:46,052 --> 01:50:47,597
A wise man gets more
from his enemies

1487
01:50:47,598 --> 01:50:48,817
than a fool from his friends.

1488
01:50:49,452 --> 01:50:51,739
And you know what? He was right.

1489
01:50:54,332 --> 01:50:58,098
Look at us. We were both a
pair of kids when we met.

1490
01:50:58,132 --> 01:50:59,941
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1491
01:50:59,972 --> 01:51:01,815
Disowned by our families.

1492
01:51:01,932 --> 01:51:03,297
Headed nowhere.

1493
01:51:04,412 --> 01:51:06,699
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1494
01:51:06,772 --> 01:51:08,183
It was not bad, huh?

1495
01:51:09,252 --> 01:51:11,175
No, it's not bad.

1496
01:51:11,252 --> 01:51:14,813
So, don't let me down now. I
need you busting my balls.

1497
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:18,017
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1498
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:20,820
But I intend to
enjoy myself first.

1499
01:51:21,172 --> 01:51:23,493
Some of life needs
to be for pleasure.

1500
01:51:23,612 --> 01:51:26,934
What's the point of having a
million cups and medals and planes

1501
01:51:27,012 --> 01:51:29,174
if you don't have any fun?

1502
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:31,701
How is that winning?

1503
01:51:32,772 --> 01:51:35,503
- James.
- We're gonna leave without you.

1504
01:51:36,012 --> 01:51:37,457
James.

1505
01:51:41,292 --> 01:51:42,703
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1506
01:51:44,452 --> 01:51:46,614
You will... champ.

1507
01:51:49,132 --> 01:51:50,896
You look good, Niki.

1508
01:51:51,452 --> 01:51:53,028
The only guy to
have his face burnt

1509
01:51:53,029 --> 01:51:54,342
off and it be an improvement.

1510
01:52:01,172 --> 01:52:03,220
Of course, he didn't listen to me.

1511
01:52:03,292 --> 01:52:04,737
For James,

1512
01:52:04,812 --> 01:52:06,974
one world title was enough.

1513
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,502
He had proved

1514
01:52:08,532 --> 01:52:11,820
what he needed to
prove, to himself

1515
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:14,179
and anyone who doubted him.

1516
01:52:15,012 --> 01:52:16,901
And two years later he retired.

1517
01:52:17,172 --> 01:52:20,813
When I saw him next in
London seven years later,

1518
01:52:20,932 --> 01:52:23,060
me as champion again,

1519
01:52:23,172 --> 01:52:25,061
him as broadcaster,

1520
01:52:25,132 --> 01:52:29,535
he was barefoot on a
bicycle with a flat tyre.

1521
01:52:29,652 --> 01:52:32,496
Still living each
day like his last.

1522
01:52:34,252 --> 01:52:35,742
When I heard he'd died,

1523
01:52:35,852 --> 01:52:38,219
aged 45, of a heart attack,

1524
01:52:38,332 --> 01:52:39,857
I wasn't surprised.

1525
01:52:40,852 --> 01:52:42,741
I was just sad.

1526
01:52:44,092 --> 01:52:45,935
People always think
of us as rivals,

1527
01:52:46,012 --> 01:52:49,619
but he was among the
very few I liked,

1528
01:52:50,932 --> 01:52:53,902
and even fewer that I respected.

1529
01:52:57,052 --> 01:52:59,783
He remains the only
person I envied.
