00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:33,480
"I was like grass and I was not torn out."
Fernando Pessoa

2
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:25,405
What are you...?
- Stop it!

3
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,358
Stop it!

4
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:38,364
You stop it!

5
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,278
What are you doing?

6
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,358
Stop it!

7
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,318
See?

8
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:29,281
AUTUMN BALL

9
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:51,280
I forgive you everything.

10
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,358
Do you still love Jaan?

11
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:06,281
It always annoys me
when I go into an interior

12
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:10,280
which is not done by a professional
and I see that it is so good...

13
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:16,317
How can it be? I feel that
I should be the one to do...

14
00:14:16,527 --> 00:14:19,405
And well I'm doing but...

15
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,478
You've got a problem.

16
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,399
Someone, who has not studied it
can suddenly do something...

17
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:31,523
Well, if one has a sense of style.

18
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:40,443
It's interesting the way
they've done it outside...

19
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:43,325
I wonder if it is finished
or still in progress.

20
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,403
They sure seem
to have something in progress.

21
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:13,522
Good party.

22
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:25,403
Listen Maurer you still live
in your... housing estate?

23
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:29,403
I do. - Why?

24
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,325
Practicing humility.

25
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,398
Yes, but really?

26
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:52,363
You're back early.

27
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,402
I'm so tired.

28
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:25,476
Of what?

29
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,438
With them everything has to be

30
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:35,482
so cozy,

31
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:40,484
pleasurable and soft.

32
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,363
With whom?

33
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:58,282
I cannot stand my friends,
colleagues any more.

34
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:08,485
That cynic attacked
me again today.

35
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:14,286
He asked me
why do we live here.

36
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:20,316
Does he really think
I'm insincere?

37
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:27,476
What a worm.

38
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,521
Yes, but really...

39
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,397
Why do we live here?

40
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,482
What?

41
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:48,444
I'm sure you could still be a fabulous
example to the mankind if you would live

42
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,438
a little bit closer
to the center of town.

43
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:53,323
What are you talking about?

44
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,443
Nobody lives here!

45
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,477
Here, there, over there!
Nobody lives here?

46
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,438
I'll get something to eat.

47
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:03,439
LITERARY CONFERENCE -
BALTIC CONCIOUSNESS 2006

48
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:17,280
Latvians and their hysterics again...

49
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:24,397
I don't think I have met you before.

50
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,403
I just came to eat.

51
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:33,442
What else is there to do here.
The presentations are as dull as always.

52
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:43,440
It is so contrived, the way
Eastern Europeans are continuously

53
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:48,277
trying to construct their identity.
Don't you think? - I do.

54
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:54,361
The West is financing
all sorts of nonsense,

55
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:57,325
trying to deal with its over fed guilt.

56
00:22:57,407 --> 00:23:02,401
But all this financing is simply
a continuation of colonialism.

57
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:07,365
There is no such thing
as Baltic consciousness!

58
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,483
There is no such thing as Baltic!

59
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:13,485
Naming things is pure violence!

60
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:20,477
You are looking at me
as if I was an idiot.

61
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,478
You know it all yourself.

62
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,399
What's your sign? - Aries.

63
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:03,359
You don't live at all like an writer.

64
00:24:09,487 --> 00:24:11,523
Have you read Pessoa?

65
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:18,320
"I made of myself something
beyond my knowledge,

66
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:23,285
And what I could make of myself
I failed to do..."

67
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:25,403
No, I haven't read it.
Who's Pessoa?

68
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:30,318
Who's Pessoa!

69
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:38,516
You're different.

70
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,517
You are... real.

71
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:46,403
Like a real person.

72
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:52,524
I'd like to read something
you've written. Will you let me?

73
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,518
I have nothing to give you.

74
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:01,363
You are modest, as well.

75
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:07,438
May be even a genius?

76
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,437
A quiet hermit noticed by no one...

77
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:19,282
But after your death your small,
shabby bachelor flat

78
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:23,526
will reveal the best text in
the world. - I'm a doorman.

79
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,358
I don't understand.

80
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:33,523
What is there to understand?

81
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:22,398
Maurer?

82
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:32,477
I saw a one-armed man today.

83
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:45,361
I'm saying that I saw a man
with one rotting hand,

84
00:29:46,407 --> 00:29:50,366
drinking cologne
and smelling of piss.

85
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,477
Do we have to discuss this now?

86
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:04,398
Oh Jesus!

87
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,478
I'm afraid of them.

88
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:21,315
I'm afraid that I might get
some horrible disease from them.

89
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:24,444
Something really contagious
even through the air.

90
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,403
Is it awful of me to speak that way?

91
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:41,438
Is it, Maurer?

92
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:49,358
Can I speak that way?

93
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:57,285
Can I even think that way?

94
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,437
Can't we discuss
this in the morning?

95
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,437
Two rooms... That's normal.

96
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,358
Three is already a luxury.

97
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:18,319
Two rooms with a kitchen
and a bathroom.

98
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,318
Not bad.

99
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:27,278
Not bad at all.

100
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm a very lucky person.

101
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:24,365
I'm done for today.

102
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,325
I'm not doing your clients.

103
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:31,398
What clients?

104
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:36,326
I've got no more
appointments for today.

105
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:40,398
What about the queue?

106
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:46,405
What queue?

107
00:32:51,407 --> 00:32:52,476
Kaski!

108
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:01,280
The fact that you're Finnish
does not change anything.

109
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:05,443
This here is
a business establishment.

110
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:10,319
Success does not come overnight.

111
00:33:11,487 --> 00:33:13,364
What we need is enthusiasm.

112
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:31,280
Don't call me! You're drunk!
Don't call here any more!

113
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:15,442
Well...

114
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:10,360
Yes, it seems to be working now.

115
00:37:14,447 --> 00:37:18,281
I wouldn't say no
to a drink, if offered.

116
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,358
Such a ladies' drink.

117
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,442
Sweet.

118
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:58,320
Nice flat you've got here.
Lots of space. - Yes.

119
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:01,398
You live here alone...

120
00:38:02,327 --> 00:38:05,444
I mean with your daughter?
- Yes.

121
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:13,436
It is not easy, everything
being so expensive these days.

122
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,438
And you, all alone...

123
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:22,286
And adults have their
needs as well, don't they.

124
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,482
What are you...

125
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:28,325
Oh no, don't! I'm just saying...

126
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,477
I'm just saying I know!

127
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:36,278
Sometimes these needs
overwhelm you so that...

128
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:40,524
And it's not getting
any easier with age!

129
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:43,283
Stop talking!

130
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:49,322
Listen young lady, don't be so...

131
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:56,276
I could... with you...

132
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:07,359
I'm a complete stranger to you.

133
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:11,479
We can be honest with each other.

134
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:14,436
There is no point...

135
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:22,519
You have my number.
If there is anything...

136
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:44,324
Laura!

137
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:46,284
Wait!

138
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,278
Listen!

139
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:59,483
I want to see my daughter!

140
00:41:01,407 --> 00:41:02,522
You're drunk.

141
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:05,398
This is unfair!

142
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:10,319
I'll have her
taken away from you!

143
00:41:10,447 --> 00:41:13,439
I know about all these men
who go to your place!

144
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:16,397
Don't think that I don't know...

145
00:41:16,527 --> 00:41:18,404
You are a slut!

146
00:41:21,487 --> 00:41:23,478
I'll kill you!

147
00:42:27,527 --> 00:42:30,485
Lotta! Come in! You'll catch cold!

148
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,283
What is this film about?

149
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:50,477
That woman is the main character.

150
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,361
Her love is forbidden love.
- What is forbidden love?

151
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,483
It's love that is not permitted.

152
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:15,483
Have you read Pessoa?

153
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,522
"I made of myself
something beyond my knowledge,

154
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,364
And what I could make of myself
I failed to do."

155
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:31,402
I know one too.

156
00:44:34,327 --> 00:44:39,321
A pig and a duck had a good fuck.

157
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:40,436
No! No!

158
00:44:41,327 --> 00:44:44,478
A pig and two ducks had a good fuck!

159
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:50,485
It's from Marjamaa region.

160
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:56,478
I'm sorry. You're a cool guy.

161
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:02,483
No offence.

162
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,323
My bad mouth...

163
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:16,358
You're cool.

164
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:19,523
It's nothing personal.

165
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,358
You're very cool.

166
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,403
What a bad mouth!

167
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:39,280
I'm really sorry!

168
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:43,326
If we have some time later on,
we'll feel sorry for you.

169
00:45:45,487 --> 00:45:47,478
I'm so sorry.

170
00:46:48,287 --> 00:46:50,482
MERIKE - Aquarius

171
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:10,446
Listen, I was thinking...

172
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:14,479
If you've got time
and have nothing better to do,

173
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:19,362
could you keep the front
of the restaurant clean?

174
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:24,318
How?

175
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,485
With a broom or something.

176
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:33,518
But I'm the doorman.

177
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:37,403
Well, we all have our responsibilities.
You have yours and I have mine.

178
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:40,399
I'm the manager here and
your job is to keep things tidy.

179
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:42,398
Differentiated task management.

180
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:49,444
I understood that it is not my job
to clean around here.

181
00:48:53,407 --> 00:48:59,403
So, we seem to have
a difference of opinions.

182
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:02,478
But I'm the manager here.

183
00:49:06,447 --> 00:49:08,483
Cleaning is not my job.

184
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:12,318
Not your cup of tea?

185
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:25,486
And where is the jacket?
The Jacket!

186
00:49:35,327 --> 00:49:38,399
Employees work!
Writers read books!

187
00:54:17,407 --> 00:54:20,479
Hello? - Well, congratulations,
God damn it! - About what?

188
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:24,320
You really don't know?
Everybody knows.

189
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:26,402
No, I don't.
- You've been given

190
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:29,399
The Cross of Terra Mariana
and a hundred thousand kroons.

191
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:32,358
The Cross, to me?
- Yes, to you.

192
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,438
It was in the paper as well.

193
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:42,482
Did you believe me?

194
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,516
No, I didn't.

195
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:50,285
I've already made this joke to five
people today. Everyone believed me!

196
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,358
Piss off with your stupid pranks!

197
00:54:52,447 --> 00:54:56,440
Listen, have you heard people saying
that I have gone mad? - No, I haven't!

198
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:51,399
It's not boredom that ends love,
but impatience.

199
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:04,326
The impatience of bodies yearning
to live, yet dying each day.

200
00:57:08,447 --> 00:57:12,440
Impatience of bodies dying
day by day, but yearning to live...

201
00:57:16,527 --> 00:57:19,360
and not letting go a single chance.

202
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:27,364
Who wish...

203
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:33,275
Impatience of bodies yearning
to live but dying each day,

204
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:37,319
Bodies that cannot
miss of single chance...

205
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:42,282
Who wish to make the most of their
limited, diminishing, mediocre lives.

206
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:47,442
Who can't...

207
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:52,361
Who wish to make the most of their
limited lives and cannot love anyone

208
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:55,479
because all others seem to them limited,
diminishing and mediocre.

209
00:57:55,527 --> 00:57:58,405
Limited, diminishing and mediocre.

210
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:06,398
Who cannot love anyone...

211
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:12,483
It is not boredom...

212
00:59:33,527 --> 00:59:36,325
So poorly printed.

213
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,318
Such a lousy print.

214
00:59:42,447 --> 00:59:44,438
Is it really that much?

215
00:59:47,407 --> 00:59:49,363
Natasha! - Yes?

216
00:59:49,447 --> 00:59:51,358
How much is "Maaja"?
- Forget it.

217
00:59:51,407 --> 00:59:53,398
What's that?
- The porn magazine!

218
00:59:55,487 --> 00:59:57,478
Doesrt it have a price on it?

219
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,439
It does but the print is so bad,
I can't read it.

220
01:00:01,327 --> 01:00:04,399
Hold on, I'll find out.
- Forget it.

221
01:00:06,447 --> 01:00:09,359
How much is "Maaja",
that porn mag?

222
01:00:11,447 --> 01:00:16,282
Yes, porn. It does, but the print
is so bad, impossible to read.

223
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:21,319
Well, there is,
but it is impossible to read.

224
01:00:21,407 --> 01:00:24,319
Thirty nine kroons.
- Thirty nine?

225
01:00:25,327 --> 01:00:27,318
Thirty nine, it's clearly visible.

226
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:30,479
Well yeah. I also looked that
thirty nine, but that seemed too much.

227
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,397
Thirty nine, it's quite clear.

228
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:37,516
What is going on here?

229
01:03:38,487 --> 01:03:42,275
What are you doing here? Dear God!

230
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:45,325
I... I just...
- I know your sort!

231
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:49,406
You're not going anywhere! Pervert!

232
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:53,478
Look! There is a pervert!

233
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,516
Look! There is a pervert!

234
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,516
Where are you going now?

235
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:04,443
Jump in, I'll give you a lift.

236
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:40,318
Closed all the time.

237
01:06:05,287 --> 01:06:06,356
Bad road.

238
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,483
You must be wondering
about my behavior.

239
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:48,315
I have been watching you
from a distance for quite a while

240
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:51,483
and I like you.

241
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:02,315
You are sad and...

242
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:07,318
...Ionely.

243
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:14,518
You have... class.

244
01:07:29,447 --> 01:07:32,439
Be mine. - Why?

245
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:44,275
There is no fairy in my house.

246
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,484
Or do you despise people like me?
- Like what?

247
01:08:16,447 --> 01:08:18,438
Perhaps you want to kiss me?

248
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,396
Lotta!

249
01:11:33,447 --> 01:11:36,280
Do you remember
what I told you about strangers?

250
01:11:39,527 --> 01:11:42,485
You mustrt accept anything
from strange men.

251
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:46,438
What does 'pervert' mean?

252
01:12:00,367 --> 01:12:04,440
It is very important
where and how I live!

253
01:12:04,527 --> 01:12:09,317
I'm an architect, not an estate agent!
- I see. You're a maniac.

254
01:13:26,407 --> 01:13:27,522
Don't look.

255
01:13:28,327 --> 01:13:31,319
Some psychopaths don't like it
when you look them in the eye.

256
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:39,517
Why did that doorman
look at you like that?

257
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:43,437
I'm afraid the kitchen is closed.

258
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,438
Give me a bottle of brandy.

259
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:55,399
Waiter! Bring me champagne!

260
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:01,404
You are divine.

261
01:15:05,407 --> 01:15:08,319
Like Aphrodite rising from the sea.

262
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:10,278
You know?

263
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:13,522
No, I don't. Behave!

264
01:15:14,527 --> 01:15:17,280
People are looking.
- What people?

265
01:15:18,327 --> 01:15:19,442
They're automats.

266
01:15:21,447 --> 01:15:25,326
You know, my wife left me...
because of my friend...

267
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:14,476
Lets drink!

268
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:21,278
Hello!

269
01:16:21,527 --> 01:16:23,438
Drinky drinky.

270
01:16:42,487 --> 01:16:46,275
Don't be so conservative.

271
01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:48,438
So reserved.

272
01:16:49,407 --> 01:16:51,443
It's not a beauty contest!

273
01:16:57,327 --> 01:16:58,476
Let's drink!

274
01:17:26,487 --> 01:17:29,320
Why do you always
wear that same dress?

275
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:32,517
What? - Shut up!

276
01:17:38,447 --> 01:17:40,403
I'm bored with it.

277
01:17:48,287 --> 01:17:51,279
Your breasts are
too small for this dress.

278
01:18:06,287 --> 01:18:08,323
Hey, young lady! Respect!

279
01:18:20,407 --> 01:18:22,477
Thank you for the lovely evening.

280
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:21,439
What's wrong?

281
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:49,405
I cried your shirt wet.

282
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:56,476
I'm sorry.

283
01:20:08,527 --> 01:20:11,360
Where did that woman go!
- What woman?

284
01:20:12,447 --> 01:20:14,324
Get my jacket.

285
01:20:34,447 --> 01:20:36,278
I'm sorry.

286
01:20:39,327 --> 01:20:41,318
I don't know what came over me.

287
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,358
Give me the keys!

288
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:27,325
Let's drive around for a bit.

289
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:29,364
I'll drive.

290
01:21:36,447 --> 01:21:40,360
Let's drive, we'll go to my place.
- Please. Please stop.

291
01:21:40,447 --> 01:21:42,438
Where are you going?

292
01:21:43,367 --> 01:21:45,403
Please don't!

293
01:21:53,487 --> 01:21:55,318
Dont go.

294
01:21:59,367 --> 01:22:01,483
Bastard!
- I'll drive the car into the tree!

295
01:22:02,327 --> 01:22:03,476
You hear?

296
01:27:22,327 --> 01:27:23,476
How did you sleep?

297
01:28:22,447 --> 01:28:24,358
Are you drinking this?

298
01:28:42,367 --> 01:28:44,323
Very good!

299
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,442
Shit,

300
01:28:54,367 --> 01:28:57,439
my shirt is so ugly.

301
01:29:18,487 --> 01:29:20,284
These...

302
01:29:21,487 --> 01:29:24,479
These are large eggs.

303
01:29:37,407 --> 01:29:38,476
Large eggs.

304
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:40,358
Anton!

305
01:31:40,447 --> 01:31:42,403
Why are you dressed like that?

306
01:31:43,527 --> 01:31:47,486
I got a job. It's impossible
to survive as a sculptor.

307
01:31:57,447 --> 01:31:59,438
Your car is not properly parked.

308
01:32:11,487 --> 01:32:13,443
Three rooms is something
completely different.

309
01:32:13,527 --> 01:32:16,439
Twenty one thousand kroons per
square metre. Pretty sweet isn't it?

310
01:32:17,327 --> 01:32:19,477
I think it's safe to say
I'm a very lucky man.

311
01:32:20,287 --> 01:32:22,482
But you, now that you're alone,
you should sell your apartment.

312
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:26,364
I don't know...
- Or find a new woman.

313
01:32:26,527 --> 01:32:29,405
Where? How? I don't know how.

314
01:32:29,527 --> 01:32:31,518
Then you should sell the apartment.

315
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:35,523
I just don't know
how to approach women.

316
01:32:36,407 --> 01:32:38,398
It's very easy to approach women.

317
01:32:38,487 --> 01:32:41,320
You should find out
when a woman is ovulating.

318
01:32:41,407 --> 01:32:45,286
Women are extremely
receptive during ovulation.

319
01:32:45,487 --> 01:32:49,480
But of course mainly to the men
who have angular jaws

320
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:52,280
and lots of body hair.

321
01:32:53,527 --> 01:32:56,405
Do you have to stick
these things everywhere?

322
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:58,318
Egoist!

323
01:33:28,287 --> 01:33:29,481
You see? See!

324
01:33:40,327 --> 01:33:42,443
Ovulation? What ovulation?

325
01:33:43,447 --> 01:33:46,484
I saw it on Discovery Channel.
- Discovery?

326
01:33:47,527 --> 01:33:49,438
Fuck off!

327
01:34:10,447 --> 01:34:13,280
I don't think I've ever eaten here.

328
01:34:22,327 --> 01:34:24,283
Exquisite cuisine.

329
01:34:41,487 --> 01:34:44,399
I have enough money now
to buy two skip containers.

330
01:34:45,327 --> 01:34:46,362
What?

331
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:48,358
Skip containers.

332
01:34:57,407 --> 01:35:01,525
Skip containers rental.
For construction waste and garbage.

333
01:35:02,527 --> 01:35:05,325
First I'll take two,
four and a half cubic meters.

334
01:35:05,407 --> 01:35:06,476
Later when the money

335
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:11,479
starts to pour in I'll take ten,
fifteen, hell, thirty cubics!

336
01:35:12,407 --> 01:35:16,446
For tractors, dump cars,
the whole deal.

337
01:35:20,367 --> 01:35:23,279
Think how much construction
takes place in this town.

338
01:35:23,407 --> 01:35:26,319
Think how much
construction waste it leaves.

339
01:35:27,447 --> 01:35:30,325
I'm not going to be
a doorman all my life.

340
01:35:42,327 --> 01:35:44,318
That is all just fine...

341
01:35:49,447 --> 01:35:52,280
But I have to be going now.

342
01:36:26,487 --> 01:36:28,523
Please wait!
Wait!

343
01:36:32,447 --> 01:36:34,438
What just happened?

344
01:36:36,367 --> 01:36:38,437
Nothing happened.

345
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:41,363
I just have to go.

346
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:43,404
But I thought...

347
01:36:45,487 --> 01:36:47,398
we had something.

348
01:36:47,487 --> 01:36:50,320
Don't say you didn't feel it.

349
01:36:52,327 --> 01:36:54,283
Yes, I felt it.

350
01:36:57,367 --> 01:36:59,278
So what happened?

351
01:37:04,447 --> 01:37:07,439
Theo, I just really have to go now.

352
01:37:13,487 --> 01:37:16,285
Give me your phone number.

353
01:37:17,367 --> 01:37:19,278
I'll call you.

354
01:38:47,527 --> 01:38:49,404
Where have you been?

355
01:38:54,527 --> 01:38:57,485
You know how much construction
waste the city generates?

356
01:38:58,327 --> 01:39:01,319
I asked you a question.
- I'll ask you something as well.

357
01:39:01,407 --> 01:39:03,443
Will you? - Yes, I will.

358
01:39:04,327 --> 01:39:05,476
Well, ask then.

359
01:39:14,527 --> 01:39:17,405
Lets talk honestly at least for once.

360
01:39:17,527 --> 01:39:19,324
Honestly?

361
01:39:19,407 --> 01:39:23,446
Yes, honestly. Not being afraid
to appear in a bad light.

362
01:39:25,447 --> 01:39:27,517
Honestly?
- Yes, honestly.

363
01:39:35,327 --> 01:39:36,442
Honestly.

364
01:39:51,367 --> 01:39:53,323
I'm bored with you.

365
01:39:57,527 --> 01:40:01,486
Your dry skin. Your cold eyes.

366
01:40:05,407 --> 01:40:10,356
Your petit bourgeois egotism,
which is so vibrant and natural,

367
01:40:17,327 --> 01:40:20,399
but to my mind
it is just plain stupidity.

368
01:40:24,367 --> 01:40:27,404
I'm bored with
your childish craving for attention.

369
01:40:29,327 --> 01:40:30,476
I'm bored with your...

370
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:36,283
...femininity.

371
01:40:41,527 --> 01:40:43,483
And you think I'm the problem?

372
01:40:45,447 --> 01:40:47,483
I don't care about the reasons.

373
01:40:48,327 --> 01:40:49,521
Do you know what you are?

374
01:40:51,527 --> 01:40:55,361
You're like some Bergman character,
not even human any more.

375
01:40:59,407 --> 01:41:02,365
Tiny little man suffering
because of your God's silence,

376
01:41:02,447 --> 01:41:05,359
squirming within his personal
black and white world.

377
01:41:09,327 --> 01:41:13,320
Maybe... Yeah.

378
01:41:22,527 --> 01:41:25,360
What are you?
What sort a man are you?

379
01:41:28,487 --> 01:41:31,445
All clean surface and self-admiration.

380
01:41:58,447 --> 01:42:01,405
That's what I think about
your clean surface.

381
01:45:52,407 --> 01:45:54,477
This is complete
lack of responsibility!

382
01:45:55,367 --> 01:45:57,358
You come here as you wish!

383
01:45:59,327 --> 01:46:02,478
If you disappear one
more time, you're gone!

384
01:46:03,447 --> 01:46:05,358
Is it clear?

385
01:46:09,327 --> 01:46:11,318
Where are you going?

386
01:46:54,527 --> 01:46:57,360
Get out! - Shit!

387
01:46:57,487 --> 01:47:01,275
Don't treat him like that.

388
01:47:06,447 --> 01:47:09,359
He's a great actor and director.
- How great?

389
01:47:10,527 --> 01:47:12,518
Rather well known.

390
01:47:32,447 --> 01:47:34,358
What do you direct?

391
01:47:36,327 --> 01:47:38,318
Relationship comedies...

392
01:47:38,407 --> 01:47:39,522
Relationship comedies?

393
01:47:45,407 --> 01:47:47,398
Relationship comedies...

394
01:47:59,367 --> 01:48:00,482
Relationship comedies.

395
01:52:03,527 --> 01:52:05,358
I came.

396
01:52:08,527 --> 01:52:10,358
Yes.

397
01:52:16,327 --> 01:52:18,318
You must hate me so much now.

398
01:52:29,487 --> 01:52:32,399
These buildings cannot
hold the past very long.

399
01:52:33,407 --> 01:52:36,365
I guess that's because they were
built thinking of the future.

400
01:52:52,487 --> 01:52:54,443
I just wanted to be happy.

401
01:52:55,487 --> 01:52:58,285
I want to be happy?

402
01:53:13,447 --> 01:53:15,517
In every fucking
little box out there,

403
01:53:16,327 --> 01:53:18,363
there is a human being
trying to be happy.

404
01:53:20,367 --> 01:53:26,397
Whole generations of mothers
and sons, fathers and daughters,

405
01:53:30,527 --> 01:53:34,486
spouses, their lovers,
car owners...

406
01:53:35,527 --> 01:53:38,325
Everybody wants to be happy.

407
01:53:41,447 --> 01:53:47,283
And their lives blow past like wind
against the grey limestone walls.

408
01:53:56,527 --> 01:53:59,405
And what is going to last of it all?

409
01:54:24,407 --> 01:54:28,286
Maybe you don't believe me,
but I still love you.

410
01:54:41,487 --> 01:54:43,523
I don't believe.

411
01:58:23,407 --> 01:58:26,319
The movie is inspired by the book
"Autumn Ball" by Mati Unt

412
01:58:26,407 --> 01:58:29,365
and dedicated to all the men
with gentle heart and weak liver

413
01:58:29,447 --> 01:58:31,438
who stand alone
in the night in underwear.
