Jesse's gonna be mad as hell at me

11
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:55,643
if I don't get this show
to the motel before sunrise.

12
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:58,980
Oh, what's the rush?

13
00:00:59,063 --> 00:01:01,315
I was supposed to be there this afternoon.

14
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,155
Jesse's not booked to perform
for at least a couple more days.

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,834
But I think you're forgetting
about practice.

16
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:23,421
One doesn't put on
a show like this without...

17
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:28,676
practice.

18
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,512
Mmm, then hang around and we'll practice.

19
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:34,849
Whoa, baby. We've been practicing all day.

20
00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:37,685
Then it's time to perform.

21
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:40,354
Jesse is going to perform on my skull

22
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:42,732
if I don't get this show on the road.

23
00:01:42,815 --> 00:01:45,276
- Oh...
- Don't worry, lover.

24
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,154
The show's only booked
for a few performances.

25
00:01:48,237 --> 00:01:51,073
I'll be back here again before we take it
to another part of the country.

26
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,284
Another part of the country?

27
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:56,412
- And another cabin?
- Mmm...

28
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:58,873
- And another girl?
- Mmm...

29
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,337
Oh, well. Who cares?
I'm having a good time.

30
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,636
Now go check the trailer
and make sure the door's closed tight.

Well, how's the door?

34
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,323
- All secure.
- Good.

35
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:34,408
Then I guess it's time to go.

36
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:35,868
Too bad.

37
00:02:37,953 --> 00:02:41,582
I hope you've had a good time. I have.

38
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,044
This cabin and these mountains
hold some beautiful memories.

39
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:47,880
Does that mean you'll come back up here
when I can get away?

40
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:51,801
If you promise to come here every time
the show's within 500 miles of this place.

41
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,427
You can count on it.

42
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:08,693
Think this thing will get you
where you're going?

43
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:11,237
Why is Jesse so cheap?

44
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,864
Any act that claims
to be the best of its kind

45
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:16,617
should at least have a truck
to haul it around in.

46
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:18,577
It could look better, PR-wise.

47
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:21,372
But for now,
we'll just be content on being the best.

48
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,499
Is Jesse really that good?

49
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:24,834
"The best"?

50
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,753
There's always someone better.

51
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:30,715
You can make an exception
in this case, baby.

52
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:34,760
As far as the planet Earth goes,
there ain't a gunslinger on this terrain

53
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:37,471
that can handle weapons
better than Jesse Jamison.

54
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,984
Damn. A plane crash.

55
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:23,429
Is anybody out there?

56
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,093
This is crazy.

57
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,765
It's gotta be here.

58
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:54,728
No!

59
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,232
No, wait! No! No! No, please!

60
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,609
Please don't. No!

61
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:03,696
No, please don't! No, wait. No! No!

62
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,197
No!

63
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,165
It's been a long time since I've seen
anyone do that blindfolded.

64
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:16,417
It's good.

65
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:20,879
Hey.

66
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,509
The sharpshooters I knew back in
the old days used one exactly like this,

67
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:29,221
only they were so thin that when you put
them on, you could see right through it.

68
00:08:29,304 --> 00:08:33,517
But it fooled the audience, and for
some people that's all that mattered.

69
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:43,444
Now let's see how sharp
those pretty eyes of yours really are.

70
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:47,698
These things blow up real pretty
when you hit one just right.

71
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:51,744
Let's see a bull's-eye.

72
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:53,662
It's all yours, Miss Jesse.

73
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:01,837
Hey, that was great, Jesse!

74
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,298
I hope I please you, Sunset.

75
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,676
What I've seen pleases me
very much, Jesse.

76
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,847
And if the rest of your show is anything
like what I've seen this morning,

77
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,476
I have no doubt the Diamond
theatrical agency will sign you up.

78
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:18,604
Jesse Jamison, fastest gun on earth!

79
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:22,066
I never claimed to be the fastest, Sunset.
Just the best.

80
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,317
Only the best?

81
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,153
The Diamond Booking Agency
is also the best.

82
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:29,031
They book acts
for all the big American amusement parks,

83
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:33,494
all the nightclubs, rodeos
and foreign shows.

84
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:35,746
My interview with Mrs. Diamond
is still at 1:00?

85
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:36,872
At 1:00.

86
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:40,501
And because I think you've got something
more on the ball than meets the eye,

87
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:41,668
let me warn you,

88
00:09:41,752 --> 00:09:45,005
be prepared when you walk
into her office to sell your show.

89
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,423
She's a tough old gal,

90
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:49,343
and she's never snowed by a pretty face.

91
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:52,596
She just uses them
to sell advertising or bookings.

92
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,889
I understand.

93
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:57,935
A lot of her agents have seen your show
and they're well impressed.

94
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:02,147
So while you're in her office,
do let her know you're there for business.

95
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,733
Thanks, Sunset.
I'll be all business at 1:00.

96
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:09,488
Hey! And don't forget,
it doesn't hurt to look your best.

97
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:35,430
Hello?

98
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:39,226
- <i>Good morning, Frank.</i>
- Oh, good morning, Jesse.

99
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,937
<i>My business manager
was up late last night.</i>

100
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,732
Yeah. I think maybe I got us
some bookings and show dates.

101
00:10:45,816 --> 00:10:47,860
<i>Get any private bookings, Frank?</i>

102
00:10:47,943 --> 00:10:51,405
<i>Sounds like you had quite
a show date yourself last night.</i>

103
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:54,408
- Oh, that agent's secretary.
- <i>She was pretty, Frank.</i>

104
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,452
<i>Did you convince her you were
a big-time booking agent</i>

105
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:59,163
<i>for the greatest gun show on earth?</i>

106
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:02,332
Come off it, Jesse.
That girl was business.

107
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,794
She's got a lot of contacts.

108
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:08,297
<i>Probably a long list of them.</i>

109
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,841
<i>Better go to the health clinic, Frank.</i>

110
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:14,469
I'd be writing all this down
if it were funny, Jesse.

111
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,638
<i>I have something else
that isn't funny, Frank.</i>

112
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,098
What, Jesse?

113
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:20,392
<i>Have you ever noticed how you and Wes</i>

114
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,644
<i>seem to get all sorts of pretty girls
using my show,</i>

115
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,062
<i>but I'm not making any money?</i>

116
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:26,982
- You've been making money.
- <i>Not much.</i>

117
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:30,068
<i>And speaking of not much,
just where is Wes?</i>

118
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:31,653
You mean he's not here yet?

119
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:34,198
<i>That's right, Frank.
That's just what I mean.</i>

120
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,868
Well, he's probably still at his cabin.

121
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,746
<i>Why, Frank? Why is he still at his cabin?</i>

122
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,998
We don't have a show
for two more days, Jesse.

123
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:44,833
<i>I need to practice, Frank.</i>

124
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,460
<i>I need my show.</i>

125
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:50,797
- He'll be here.
- <i>You've told me that before, Frank.</i>

126
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,966
<i>We've missed shows before, Frank.</i>

127
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,510
- Cut it out. I'm tired. I was up late.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

128
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:57,596
<i>This is the operator.
You'll have to deposit another--</i>

129
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:59,640
Just charge it to her room
and shut up, Operator.

130
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:00,557
<i>Sir?</i>

131
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:02,643
- <i>Frank?</i>
- Or put it on my bill.

132
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:05,729
Whoever heard of a hotel operator
charging for a room-to-room call?

133
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:08,440
- I'm not at the motel, Frank.
- <i>Where the hell are you?</i>

134
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,943
I had an appointment today
with the Diamond book--

135
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,528
Uh, I had an appointment
to have the oil in my car changed.

136
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:16,490
- <i>All right, we'll talk tonight.</i>
- We'll talk when I get back, Frank.

137
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:18,575
<i>Fine. Right now, I just want some sleep.</i>

138
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:20,953
Right now, I want you to find out
where Wes's cabin is.

139
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:22,996
<i>Sir, I cannot put it on your bill.</i>

140
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,376
<i>I bet this operator is only 15
and she's wearing some really tight pants.</i>

141
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,711
- <i>Sir...</i>
- We were talking about Wes's cabin.

142
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:31,713
- ... <i>do you realize this is a public utility...</i>
<i>- What?</i>

143
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:33,632
- Wes's cabin!
<i>- It's in the mountains.</i>

144
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:36,134
Wow, that tells me a lot, Frank.
I know it's in the mountains.

145
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:40,055
Wes has some kind of nasty cabin tucked
away on every mountain in the country.

146
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,432
I want you to find out where this one is.

147
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:44,518
Go there if you have to. I want my show.

148
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:46,645
I want it at the motel.
And I want it tonight.

149
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:47,688
Call Wes's uncle.

150
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:49,648
<i>...regarding the operation
of this facility.</i>

151
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:52,693
- You know, I like young girls, Operator.
<i>- I must insist that--</i>

152
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:54,861
Wes's uncle Alex. He'll know where it is.

153
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:56,196
<i>Frank, you call Alex.</i>

154
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,449
- <i>Abusive language will not be tolerated...</i>
<i>- Okay, just let me get some sleep.</i>

155
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:02,452
- Call now, Frank.
- Okay. Just let me get some sleep.

156
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,621
<i>Call now, Frank!</i>

157
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:07,791
I can't hear you, Jesse.
This line's too noisy.

158
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,876
What color are your shorts, Operator?

159
00:13:11,545 --> 00:13:14,548
Why have I put up with this for so long?

160
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,399
Whew.

161
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,835
Whew-whew!

162
00:13:53,503 --> 00:13:55,547
Now, Jack, that's a nice outfit.

163
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:01,595
Hey, you can't bring it back!

164
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:45,305
- Good morning, Miss Jamison.
- What's going on here?

165
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,225
I believe it's about checkout time,
Miss Jamison.

166
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:51,770
Checkout time?
We're gonna be here for two more days.

167
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,231
I'm sorry, Miss Jamison.
No one made me aware of that.

168
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:56,358
Well, you're aware of it now.

169
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:58,318
Put my bags back in the room.

170
00:14:58,402 --> 00:15:01,363
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Jamison,
but we're all filled up.

171
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:03,073
And I've already booked
this room for the week.

172
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:06,284
That's ridiculous.
You must have another room.

173
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,370
What about my manager? Where is he?

174
00:15:08,453 --> 00:15:10,580
We called him
when he was late for checkout time.

175
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,791
He said he wanted his room
for two more nights.

176
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:16,837
And didn't he also say that I wanted
this room for two more nights?

177
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,257
Apparently, you are the victim
of bad management, Miss Jamison.

178
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:24,636
We're liberal people here. We understand.

179
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:29,015
I'll have the porter take your bags
down to your, uh, manager's room.

180
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,362
- Boy.
- Huh?

181
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:45,490
The bags in front of 203,
take them down to 110.

182
00:15:45,574 --> 00:15:47,284
I'm going to lunch.

183
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,744
- Always leaving for lunch.
- What's that?

184
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:52,831
- I said, "Yes, ma'am."
- Oh.

185
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,418
Well, hop to it.

186
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:58,795
I like to see a little hustle
out of my employees,

187
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,881
especially when I'm having to pay them
minimum wage.

188
00:16:00,964 --> 00:16:02,466
Going right now.

189
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:07,929
Carry the bags, clean the room,
swab the deck, mop the floor!

190
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:09,514
Take them up, take them down!

191
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,685
Frank! Frank, open the door.

192
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,063
Frank, I wanna talk to you.

193
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:23,695
It's monotonous. I'm young.
I need some excitement around here.

194
00:16:23,778 --> 00:16:27,157
I wanna swing. I wanna dance.
I wanna ha-cha-cha-cha.

195
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:30,327
Frank?

196
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,706
I have a 1:00 appointment
and I need this room.

197
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:37,918
Frank?

198
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,337
Okay, Frank.

199
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:48,512
Do you have a passkey?

200
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:51,848
No, ma'am.

201
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:56,269
- Only the manager has a passkey.
- Where is she?

202
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:58,396
Godzilla's gone to lunch.

203
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,505
Never mind me. I'm just the porter.

204
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:32,847
Frank!

205
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:37,519
Dear? Dear?

206
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,312
Beautiful man!

207
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,275
Frank...

208
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:46,111
Frank.

209
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,737
Wake up, sleepy head.

210
00:17:47,821 --> 00:17:49,197
Get the hell up!

211
00:17:49,281 --> 00:17:51,616
Come and open the door, Frank.

212
00:17:55,036 --> 00:17:57,330
He doesn't seem to hear me.

213
00:17:57,956 --> 00:18:00,625
Okay, scum! Open the damn door!

214
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:04,921
That was it, Frank.
That was your last chance.

215
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:07,674
Better be away from the door now,
Rip Van Winkle.

216
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,553
- Ow.
- I've got a passkey to open all doors.

217
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,473
I hate this job!

218
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:19,019
Wake-up call.

219
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:30,090
Hey, bozo. What are you doing in there?

220
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:33,468
We put the door up to keep the horse in.

221
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:35,970
So keep the doors shut.

222
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,850
What is this, Halloween?

223
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:12,090
- Hi, boys.
- Hello, Alex.

224
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,258
Good to see you.

225
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:15,593
You fellas up here for a vacation?

226
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:18,304
- Uh-huh.
- You bet.

227
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:27,355
Oh. Yeah, college students always dress
more for comfort than they do for working.

228
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,065
Oh, she's not there for work.

229
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:31,067
It's a study course from college, I think.

230
00:20:31,151 --> 00:20:32,444
Check it out.

231
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:38,533
She's majoring in agriculture
and farm resources, I believe.

232
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:43,371
Maybe we should help her out
and see that she gets the lay of the land.

233
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,206
You know? Me?

234
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,250
Here.

235
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:52,922
- Are you ready?
- Just a minute.

236
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:58,511
This all looks a little strange to me.

237
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:02,849
You ready?
Get the hell outta there. Come on.

238
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:09,063
You boys were looking
at the girl, weren't you?

239
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:12,567
Have you noticed she's moved over there?

240
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:23,745
Damn!

241
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,209
Why in the immortal hell

242
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:31,628
didn't you tell me
they were clearing land?

243
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:34,923
You all right, Alex?
Hey, is that the last one, Jane?

244
00:21:35,006 --> 00:21:37,884
I think so, Peter. At least for today.

245
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:40,345
- Hello, Alex!
- Hello, Luger.

246
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:42,680
What are you doing off work so early?

247
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:45,975
Well, I got special company
coming tonight.

248
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:47,811
I had to go home and clean my house.

249
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:50,396
I tell you what,
after you get through cleaning yours,

250
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,565
come over and help me clean mine,
all right?

251
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:55,568
Looks like you got a college girl
to help you clean yours.

252
00:21:55,652 --> 00:21:58,029
Ah, hell, she's one of them modern women.

253
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,490
She'd rather work out in the garden
like a mule.

254
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:05,119
Hey-- Damn! She's crazy too!

255
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:07,956
I wonder why it is Luger always gets
those female students

256
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,166
to come up and intern on his farm?

257
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,419
Maybe he's got an earthy sex appeal
about him. What do you think?

258
00:22:14,087 --> 00:22:15,129
How about you, pal?

259
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:17,924
Who's the special company
you're expecting this evening?

260
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:20,593
Just a girl my nephew works for.

261
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:21,970
Uh, your nephew Wes?

262
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:23,930
- That's right.
- Wes?

263
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,974
Where the hell does he find time to work?

264
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:28,476
Every time I hear from that boy,
he's shacked up somewhere.

265
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,146
Wes's daddy left him so much money,
he bought six damn mountain cabins,

266
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,190
each one of them
in a different part of the country.

267
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:37,193
And he keeps them all stocked
with young lovers. You know what I mean?

268
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:39,404
- Mm. Sounds nice.
- Yeah.

269
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:42,740
But who is this woman he works for?

270
00:22:42,824 --> 00:22:46,995
Well, I probably should have said
"worked for" instead of "works for."

271
00:22:47,078 --> 00:22:50,415
I think she's coming up to fire him,
and I can't say he doesn't deserve it.

272
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:53,501
- That isn't that Jesse Jamison, is it?
- The one and only.

273
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,337
- Who's Jesse Jamison?
- She's the Annie Oakley of the '808.

274
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:58,172
- You've never heard of her?
- The what?

275
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,091
She's got a gun show and it's pretty good,

276
00:23:00,174 --> 00:23:05,179
despite the way my nephew and
that lazy manager of hers has handled it.

277
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:08,641
Yeah, but, you know,
they do a lot of low-rent stuff--

278
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:11,519
perform for supermarkets,
department store grand openings.

279
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,062
You know what those things are like.

280
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:16,357
Yeah, but with a little bigger show
and a little more range,

281
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:18,359
I think she could hit the big time.

282
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:22,614
She's a fantastic lady, Peter, and she
handles a gun like nobody I've ever seen.

283
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:26,284
Well, sounds like ol' Alex
should have us over for dinner tonight.

284
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:27,660
- Huh?
- Definitely.

285
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,330
- I will on one condition.
- What's that, Alex?

286
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:32,498
Tell me where in these damn mountains

287
00:23:32,582 --> 00:23:35,668
are you gonna find fish big enough
for this rig you're carrying?

288
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:39,714
It's big enough for the Loch Ness Monster.

289
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:42,258
This is just for casting practice.

290
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:45,303
I brought it along because
I'm in a large tournament next week

291
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:47,221
and I want to do real good in it.

292
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:50,099
- Jane, I'll be back in a minute!
- All right!

293
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,441
Why don't you just show him
how you hang those big ones, Peter?

294
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,318
Okay, watch this.

295
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:04,030
This man never misses.
Buffalo Bill with a fishing rod.

296
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:07,867
What the hell?

297
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:09,827
Boy, I'll tell you one thing.

298
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:12,413
You better be glad
you didn't get no skin off my hind end,

299
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:14,082
'cause I'd sure take some of yours.

300
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:19,087
Maybe you should just show Jesse Jamison
how you handle that rod of yours, Peter.

301
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,797
Well, so much for the humor.

302
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,091
I'll see you boys over at my place
for dinner, right?

303
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:25,593
- You got it. See you, Alex.
- Take care, Alex.

304
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:30,515
Alex, why don't you take
these two turds with you?

305
00:24:30,598 --> 00:24:32,767
All right, let's hit these woods, buddy.

306
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,978
I'm about ready
for a little recreation.

307
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:37,271
It looks like a beautiful day.
I can't wait!

308
00:24:37,355 --> 00:24:40,692
- Let's do it.
- Hey, Jane!

309
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:45,363
Would you like to go along with us up to
the creek for a little fun and relaxation?

310
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:47,573
Me? Alone with you two?

311
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:51,035
Why not? Besides,
you'll get to see Andrew sunbathe.

312
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,997
That's right. Why don't you come on?
We can take all our clothes off.

313
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,583
I think I'll be safer if I stay here
and keep my clothes on.

314
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,086
- That's too bad.
- Hey, Jane!

315
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:01,838
You stay away from them boys.

316
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:04,841
It ain't no time for partying.
You boys leave her alone.

317
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:06,592
Anyway, I have to work.

318
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,594
So maybe next time.

319
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:11,848
- Okay, maybe next time.
- Wow, yes, ma'am.

320
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,099
Maybe.

321
00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:15,268
Jane, I'll be back in a minute, I reckon.

322
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:18,563
Y'all just go about your business now.

323
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:21,357
- Next time. Anytime.
- Wow, yes, ma'am.

324
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,776
- Okay. See you, Janie.
- See you.

325
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:30,491
It's just as well. It'll be me and you.
Drink a few beers, do a little fishing.

326
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:35,580
They're silly.

327
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,921
I wonder how they pay the rent with this.

328
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,885
Small-time stuff here.

329
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:53,765
Interesting portfolio, Miss Jamison.

330
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:56,642
Very interesting.

331
00:25:56,726 --> 00:25:58,895
You present your credentials quite well.

332
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:05,318
Nevertheless, I've always felt
that gun shows and things of that sort

333
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:07,695
are about as exciting as a bowel movement.

334
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,032
- You know what I mean.
- Well, no.

335
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:14,368
I've never compared entertainment
to a bodily function before.

336
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:17,789
You would if you saw
some of the stuff that comes in here.

337
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:22,543
What I'm saying is
that acts like gun shows

338
00:26:22,627 --> 00:26:25,088
just do not have punch.

339
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:28,091
They lack sparkle, style.

340
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:29,759
You know what I'm saying.

341
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:32,303
I only know
you're not talking about my show.

342
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,141
The Diamond Booking Agency
needs acts with class.

343
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:39,769
We play in places besides...

344
00:26:39,852 --> 00:26:42,396
mill towns and county fairs.

345
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,689
We book acts and talent

346
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:47,443
for some of the most prestigious
social events in the country.

347
00:26:47,527 --> 00:26:51,739
You are aware of our prestige and
reputation in the business, aren't you?

348
00:26:51,823 --> 00:26:54,033
- That's why I'm here.
- Of course.

349
00:26:55,368 --> 00:26:58,913
And you know it takes a great deal
of skillful and well-schooled talent

350
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:01,833
to fill the needs and demands
of our clientele.

351
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:04,710
People are asking us
to provide entertainment

352
00:27:04,794 --> 00:27:06,295
for all types of occasions.

353
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,841
- Sounds like you need me.
- We need people with something special.

354
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:14,095
People who can take something
as dated and dull as a gun show

355
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:16,180
and turn it into...

356
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:19,851
a momentous event.

357
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:23,563
A momentous event?
Now you're talking about my show.

358
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:25,106
Oh? Really?

359
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:26,607
Oh, yes.

360
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:28,526
A momentous event?

361
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:31,654
- A gun show?
- Yes, Mrs. Diamond.

362
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:34,615
- Your gun show?
- A momentous event.

363
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,367
A momentous event?

364
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,871
That's not exactly what I hear.

365
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:42,081
But it's pretty close.

366
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:47,545
And if what my talent scouts and advisers
are telling me is true, Miss Jamison,

367
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:50,631
then it's time for your act
to move up in the world.

368
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:52,383
With us.

369
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:55,595
With the help
of the Diamond Booking Agency,

370
00:27:55,678 --> 00:28:00,892
you can have not only
the best gun show on earth,

371
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:04,854
but the greatest gun show
the earth has ever seen.

372
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:07,940
We are that big, Miss Jamison.

373
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:09,066
Oh, really?

374
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,862
Miss Jamison,
with the help of Diamond Booking,

375
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:17,116
you will never have to play
one of those backwoods performances again.

376
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,901
- We made it.
- This is it!

377
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:53,819
- This is great.
- This is it!

378
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:55,863
I outdid myself again.

379
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:57,531
We're back to nature!

380
00:28:57,615 --> 00:28:58,616
Whoo!

381
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,577
- Throw me one of those beers.
- Let me get my stuff settled.

382
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:03,704
Get this old feller out right here.

383
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:09,043
- Where's that beer at?
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

384
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:10,127
Here.

385
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:12,421
Man, let's cool that boy off a little bit.

386
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:14,131
It's time to get crazy.

387
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:16,926
Crazy? You already look like a lunatic.

388
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:20,263
- Settle down.
- Oh, kiss my shorts, brother.

389
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:24,684
We're in the country. Come on. It's time
to let loose and have a little bit of fun.

390
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:29,647
Damn, you idiot!
What the hell's wrong with you?

391
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,607
What's wrong with you?

392
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:35,027
I came out here to get loose,
enjoy myself, have a little fun.

393
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:38,281
Well, tighten up.
I came out here to relax, all right?

394
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:39,740
Relax?

395
00:29:39,824 --> 00:29:43,411
This is the jungle, man.
Wild beasts. Hungry predators. Here.

396
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:45,037
Come on, fire a few rounds.

397
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:48,165
Loosen up a little bit.

398
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:51,335
Come on. Kill some animals.
Enjoy yourself.

399
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:52,670
No.

400
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:57,925
I don't feel like making a fool
out of myself today. Okay, Andrew?

401
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,721
I came out here with you to get
a little relaxation and a little sun,

402
00:30:01,804 --> 00:30:04,974
and on top of that,
a lot of peace and quiet.

403
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:08,019
Let me practice
casting my line, all right?

404
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:11,814
Man, you're already getting dull.
We ain't been here ten minutes.

405
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,190
Jeez.

406
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,512
Sorry, Peter. I won't disturb you anymore.

407
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,681
- Okay?
- Man...

408
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:56,650
Ha-ha. Look at this.

409
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:00,654
Thanks, Mr. Clean.

410
00:31:00,738 --> 00:31:04,283
Oh, I just really appreciate
you picking up my trash.

411
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:09,038
Ha! What can I say?

412
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:13,709
I guess you are pretty good
with that thing.

413
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:17,046
I'll tell you, Andrew, I really want
to win that tournament next weekend.

414
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:19,382
You know they're giving away a boat?

415
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:22,134
The grand prize is a boat.

416
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:24,637
Think you got any chance at all
of winning it?

417
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,723
I don't know. I'll be up against
some pretty stiff competition.

418
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:30,142
I'm fairly good with that light line,

419
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,395
but it's this heavier stuff
that gives me the trouble.

420
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:36,148
See, that's why I brought along
this 17-pound test line.

421
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:39,944
I need practice. Lots of practice.

422
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:42,655
Well, practice, practice, practice.

423
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:43,948
Thank you.

424
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:49,787
What do you say for now
we go find some serious targets, though?

425
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,830
What?

426
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,332
Let's trot over that hill right there.

427
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,418
I'll bet there's a lot of birds
over there.

428
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:57,420
Eff.

429
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,339
I'm gonna let you use my favorite rifle.

430
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:03,134
I'm gonna try to bring them down
with this baby right here.

431
00:32:03,217 --> 00:32:05,803
- "Bring them down"?
- Birds.

432
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:08,514
- Birds!
- Why?

433
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:12,560
What the hell is wrong with you?
I mean, what's your problem?

434
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:15,271
I just don't like killing animals.

435
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:17,773
Christ, they're just birds, damn it,

436
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:20,734
and there's nothing wrong
with knocking off a few damn birds--

437
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:23,571
or squirrels, or rabbits, or whatever.

438
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:25,322
Then enjoy yourself.

439
00:32:26,782 --> 00:32:29,827
I could have sworn
we came up here on vacation.

440
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,788
- We are.
- Then when are we gonna start having fun?

441
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:35,958
- I am, Andrew.
- Casting your damn fishing rod.

442
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,961
There are some pleasures in life
that just can't be defined,

443
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,838
and this happens to be one of them.

444
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:43,632
Well, you just have yourself a real blast.

445
00:32:50,764 --> 00:32:52,892
Don't kill anything you won't eat.

446
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:55,978
Yes, sir, Mr. Game Warden.

447
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:58,564
- I just don't like waste. That's all.
- Waste?

448
00:32:59,482 --> 00:33:01,901
I'd like for you to know
that if it wasn't for hunters,

449
00:33:01,984 --> 00:33:05,237
there'd be a lot of stinking animals
running wild all over the place.

450
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:08,032
So there's just nothing wrong
with shooting a few damn birds.

451
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:10,868
- Then have a good kill, pioneer.
- You can bet on it.

452
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:13,078
And tell Daniel Boone I said hello.

453
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:17,333
And beware of redskins. You know there's
potential danger behind every tree.

454
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:20,085
Listen, butt face,
you'd be thinking a lot differently

455
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:23,172
if squirrels and other animals
weren't kept in control around here.

456
00:33:23,255 --> 00:33:25,216
Right. First you want to shoot at targets.

457
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:27,885
Next you want to terminate
out-of-control squirrels.

458
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:30,554
Why don't you go ahead
and make a big joke about it.

459
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:32,431
But you just remember this:

460
00:33:32,515 --> 00:33:36,727
It's people like me
who protect people like you.

461
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,270
Protect me, Andrew.

462
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:41,774
Protect me from the deadly squirrels.
Oh, they're falling out of the sky!

463
00:33:41,857 --> 00:33:44,401
The crazed deer! The vicious rabbits!

464
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:47,780
Here comes a deadly woodpecker!
Look out!

465
00:33:47,863 --> 00:33:49,990
Jackass.

466
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:52,743
Go on.

467
00:33:55,496 --> 00:33:57,540
Acts like a dildo.

468
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,601
P-Peter? Peter!

469
00:34:19,728 --> 00:34:20,729
H-Help!

470
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:22,815
Help? Ha!

471
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,400
Help!

472
00:34:24,483 --> 00:34:27,486
Help you kill some poor animal?

473
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,322
Why don't you try shooting at something
that can shoot back?

474
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:51,969
Andrew?

475
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,306
Where has he gone?

476
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,515
Andrew!

477
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:58,392
You all right?

478
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:04,064
Andrew!

479
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:09,528
Andrew!

480
00:35:15,868 --> 00:35:17,161
Oh, God!

481
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:42,728
No.

482
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:29,400
And this gun was given to me by my father.

483
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:31,652
It's a Browning .22 lever-action.

484
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:34,613
I started shooting with that gun
when I was seven years old.

485
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:36,532
Tremendous collection.

486
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,867
And you say your show
is in transit at the present time?

487
00:36:38,951 --> 00:36:42,162
- Yes.
- In good hands, I hope.

488
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:46,417
So, in a week, you will have fulfilled
all of your prior commitments.

489
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,794
- Eh, Miss Jamison?
- Yes, Mrs. Diamond.

490
00:36:48,877 --> 00:36:51,004
I wish you could start
preparing and organizing

491
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:52,840
your new show with us immediately,

492
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:56,385
but I respect your obligation
with other agents.

493
00:36:56,468 --> 00:36:59,680
And I am sure you will show
the same courtesies to the Diamond Agency.

494
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:02,725
- Thank you.
- But let me caution you, Miss Jamison.

495
00:37:02,808 --> 00:37:06,520
In a week, we will be promoting you big.

496
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:09,440
No more small-town stuff.

497
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:12,067
You will have to stop giving
those backwoods performances.

498
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:13,402
Well, I certainly don't expect--

499
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:17,197
We will be working on an image,
Miss Jamison.

500
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:19,032
Understand?
- Yes.

501
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:21,201
With the Diamond Booking Agency
behind you,

502
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:28,500
the scope of your little gun show
will be stretched beyond your imagination.

503
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:42,973
Okay, Mrs. Diamond.

504
00:37:43,056 --> 00:37:46,602
After this week,
no more backwoods performances.

505
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:56,069
Oh, Jesse.

506
00:37:56,153 --> 00:37:59,281
I was wondering
when you were gonna come back.

507
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:01,575
It's a good thing we don't have a show
for two more days.

508
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:03,660
Wes isn't here yet.

509
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:07,456
Looks like we'll be going
to Alex's place after all.

510
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,711
The maid came in and wanted to clean up.
I told her not to bother.

511
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:16,423
I needed to sleep
after working like I did last night.

512
00:38:19,092 --> 00:38:20,969
You know,
she saw what you did to the lock.

513
00:38:21,053 --> 00:38:23,555
It looks like we're gonna be
buying a new door, Jesse.

514
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:32,231
All that time and energy
I spent last night,

515
00:38:32,314 --> 00:38:36,360
and that agent's secretary
turns out to be a real loser.

516
00:38:38,153 --> 00:38:40,531
You know, she called
shortly after you left.

517
00:38:40,614 --> 00:38:45,118
Said she couldn't talk her boss into
booking us, not even for one single show.

518
00:38:45,202 --> 00:38:47,329
God, that burns me up.

519
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:50,916
Leading me to believe
she really had influence.

520
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,711
It's amazing how some people
abuse a little bit of power.

521
00:38:54,795 --> 00:38:56,713
I understand, Frank.

522
00:38:56,797 --> 00:38:59,842
I know how you hate
being abused by young girls.

523
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:01,468
You know what I mean, Jesse.

524
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:05,013
Yes, I do, Frank.
I know exactly what you mean.

525
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:08,767
You mean that you have
absolutely nothing booked after this week.

526
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:11,770
And the reason for that
is you have no discipline.

527
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:15,858
The only time you ever manage to get
anything booked at all is by pure luck.

528
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:18,485
The rest of the time, you use my show

529
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:21,780
to impress some gullible young girl
and get her into bed with you.

530
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:23,365
Well, I'm tired of it.

531
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:26,451
Jesse, I am shocked and offended.

532
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:28,036

Where's the map, Amanda? I don't see it.

553
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,321
I know I put it in there, Robert.
I'm not lying.

554
00:40:44,404 --> 00:40:45,656
I can't find it.

555
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:48,241
- Well, I know I put it in there.
- Then where the hell is it?

556
00:40:48,325 --> 00:40:49,743
Somebody must have taken it.

557
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:51,954
Nobody drives
the darn car but you, Amanda.

558
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:53,538
Somebody could have stolen it.

559
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:55,832
Why don't you just admit
you left the darn thing at home?

560
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:58,627
I didn't leave it at home. I put it
right there in the glove compartment.

561
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,421
- I don't see it.
- Warren, can you help this lady?

562
00:41:01,505 --> 00:41:02,673
Right, George.

563
00:41:02,756 --> 00:41:04,132
Now I'm gonna have to buy a new map.

564
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:06,677
- Just fill it up please.
- Yes, ma'am.

565
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,346
No, Robert. I'll buy the map.
You just stay in the car.

566
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:11,098
No, no, no. I'm gonna buy the map.

567
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,308
No, just shut up. Okay?
I don't want to hear it.

568
00:41:13,392 --> 00:41:16,103
- I'm going to buy the map.
- Shut your mouth. I'll buy the darn map!

569
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,689
- You stay in the car. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, I'll pay for the map.

570
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:20,023
I'll buy the map.

571
00:41:20,107 --> 00:41:23,235
What do you think you're doing?
You come back here right now!

572
00:41:24,987 --> 00:41:27,572
You'd think people far enough along
to afford a car like this

573
00:41:27,656 --> 00:41:28,991
wouldn't act like schoolchildren.

574
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:31,159
Maturity doesn't necessarily
come with age.

575
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:33,620
- Or with money.
- You said that right, ma'am.

576
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:39,126
- A horse trough?
- Yes, ma'am.

577
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:41,586
We refuel horses as well as cars.

578
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,963
Quite an enterprise.

579
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:46,758
I bet we've refueled ol' Alex Thompson's
horse more than anybody else's.

580
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:47,968
Alex Thompson?

581
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:51,388
Yes, ma'am. His horse is forever running
away and coming down here to eat.

582
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:54,182
That's funny.
I'm headed for Alex's house now.

583
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:55,892
- You are?
- Yes, I am.

584
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:57,894
Well, don't eat his cooking.

585
00:41:57,978 --> 00:41:59,896
Even his horse can't stand it.

586
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:06,653
Kiss my butt.

587
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,780
Shut up, Amanda, and get in the car.
How much is this map?

588
00:42:08,864 --> 00:42:11,658
- I believe that's a dollar.
- A dollar down the drain, Amanda.

589
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:14,369
Kiss my butt, Robert.
I know I put it in the glove compartment.

590
00:42:14,453 --> 00:42:15,871
Then why wasn't it there?

591
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:18,081
- You lose everything.
- Kiss my butt, Robert.

592
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:20,000
- How much?
- Ten dollars.

593
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,084
Thanks.

594
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:24,046
Here, try not to lose this one.
What are you complaining about now?

595
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:26,298
- I didn't lose it.
- It wasn't there.

596
00:42:26,381 --> 00:42:28,884
Watch, Robert.
Watch me put it in the glove compartment.

597
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:31,428
Give me the map.
I'm putting it right here. Do you see?

598
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:32,596
- Go ahead.
- It's right there!

599
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:34,431
You watch the stupid thing
blow out of the window.

600
00:42:34,514 --> 00:42:37,059
And then who are you gonna blame, huh?
Who you gonna blame then?

601
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:38,143
Just shut up.

602
00:42:38,226 --> 00:42:40,896
Robert, I've had it with you.
Kiss my butt.

603
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:42,689
Oh, for God's sake.

604
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:49,362
- You're Jesse Jamison, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

605
00:42:49,446 --> 00:42:51,156
I thought I knew who you were.

606
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,075
Alex's nephew works for you,
doesn't he?

607
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:54,159
Yes, he does.

608
00:42:54,242 --> 00:42:57,621
Alex's nephew... Wes?

609
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:03,376
Warren, just put the lady's gas cap
back on, will you?

610
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,630
No, he's right.

611
00:43:06,713 --> 00:43:09,633
Wes has been a little something
less than an asset working for me.

612
00:43:09,716 --> 00:43:11,843
Yeah, I recall Alex saying

613
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:14,971
he hoped working for you might settle
his sister's boy down to business.

614
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:18,433
- Mm-mmm.
- Hmm.

615
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:21,436
All ready.

616
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:23,105
Thank you.

617
00:43:27,067 --> 00:43:30,112
You know, I saw your show
about a year ago, Mrs. Jamison.

618
00:43:30,195 --> 00:43:31,404
It sure was good.

619
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:35,117
I feel like every man
should have a gun to protect his family.

620
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,494
- You do?
- Yes, ma'am.

621
00:43:39,204 --> 00:43:43,291
That's funny. I think some people
shouldn't even own a water pistol.

622
00:44:17,826 --> 00:44:18,994
Damn.

623
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,925
Three of them.

624
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:54,196
- Hello, Jesse.
- Hello, Alex.

625
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:56,740
It's nice to see you again, little lady.

626
00:44:56,823 --> 00:44:59,034
It's been a long time, Alex. How are you?

627
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:01,578
Fine, thank you.
Pretty good for an old mountain man.

628
00:45:01,661 --> 00:45:04,122
Oh, you're not old
and you're not a mountain man either.

629
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:06,166
Of course I'm a mountain man.
Look around you.

630
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,043
This is all right in the middle
of the mountains.

631
00:45:08,126 --> 00:45:11,504
All I see is the owner of the most popular
sporting goods store in the county.

632
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:13,215
But a mountain man at heart.

633
00:45:13,298 --> 00:45:14,674
You still living alone up here?

634
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:17,260
Yes. I'm looking forward
to your company today.

635
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:19,221
I fixed up the guest room,

636
00:45:19,304 --> 00:45:21,765
and I've invited
a couple of young men to dinner.

637
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:23,725
- How young?
- Well, not too young.

638
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:26,186
- Just about right for you.
- Sounds great.

639
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:28,521
- Come on in.
- First, I'd like to find Wes.

640
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:29,940
Is his cabin very far?

641
00:45:30,023 --> 00:45:32,442
Not very far.
I haven't seen that boy in years.

642
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:36,279
- I'll take you up right after dinner.
- I need to go now, Alex, and alone.

643
00:45:36,363 --> 00:45:39,282
I have some business to finish with Wes.
Do you understand?

644
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:41,368
I understand.
But can't it wait until after dinner?

645
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:42,452
I'm afraid not.

646
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:44,996
Wes was supposed to meet me
at a motel yesterday.

647
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,957
You know how punctual he is.

648
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,626
Yes, I understand he has
a little trouble meeting appointments

649
00:45:49,709 --> 00:45:51,044
that don't concern a girl.

650
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:54,047
You said it. And I think he's still
shacked up in his cabin.

651
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,548
I want to catch him before he leaves,

652
00:45:55,632 --> 00:45:57,550
'cause if he starts now,
I came up here for nothing.

653
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:00,345
I understand. Come on in.
NI draw you some directions.

654
00:46:00,428 --> 00:46:01,638
Great!

655
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:21,926
You know, that road up to Wes's cabin
is a real rough mountain road.

656
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,305
I'm gonna put you
in some real transportation.

657
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,396
Oh...

658
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:36,649
What a beautiful animal!

659
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:38,651
I thought you'd like him.

660
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:40,862
Are you gonna let me ride him
to Wes's cabin?

661
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:42,572
Well, that's the general idea.

662
00:47:43,323 --> 00:47:44,741
What's his name?

663
00:47:44,824 --> 00:47:47,535
- Um, well...
- Well?

664
00:47:48,328 --> 00:47:50,205
We call him Mr. Stud.

665
00:47:50,288 --> 00:47:52,290
- Mister...
- Stud.

666
00:47:52,374 --> 00:47:53,625
Mr. Stud.

667
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,252
- He's quite a horse.
- I can imagine.

668
00:47:56,336 --> 00:47:58,463
We'll be burning moonlight pretty soon.

669
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:01,508
I hope you get back
before the dinner gets cold.

670
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:04,469
- Well, let's saddle up Mr. Stud.
- You got it.

671
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,548
Always someplace besides
where he's needed.

672
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:50,640
Damn it, Wes! That's not funny.

673
00:48:51,474 --> 00:48:53,518
Wes, is that you?

674
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:57,897
All right, whoever's in there,
I'm giving you five seconds to come out,

675
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:00,525
and then I'm gonna blow you
straight to hell.

676
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:03,862
One-thousand one, one-thousand two,

677
00:49:03,945 --> 00:49:05,780
one-thousand three...

678
00:49:05,864 --> 00:49:07,073
Don't shoot.

679
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:09,951
Speak up, woman!
What the devil's going on in there?

680
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:12,162
Are-- Are you Jesse Jamison?

681
00:49:12,245 --> 00:49:15,039
Come out here and get my autograph.
Get out now.

682
00:49:15,123 --> 00:49:16,583
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

683
00:49:16,666 --> 00:49:18,918
- But move slowly.
- Yes, ma'am.

684
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:24,549
I-- I thought you were them.

685
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:28,511
They keep coming by here. I wouldn't have
fired the gun had I known that--

686
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:30,096
If you'd known it was me?

687
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,891
Damn it, woman!
People kill their best friends that way.

688
00:49:32,974 --> 00:49:35,310
- I didn't think.
- Obviously.

689
00:49:35,393 --> 00:49:37,562
Are you sure you're alone in there?

690
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:38,855
Yes, ma'am.

691
00:49:38,938 --> 00:49:41,900
- Who did you mistake me for?
- The monsters.

692
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:44,903
The what? Monsters?

693
00:49:44,986 --> 00:49:46,362
They look like monsters.

694
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:48,531
Where's Wes?

695
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:50,700
Are you one of his friends?

696
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:52,660
Uh, yes.

697
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:54,704
He left last night. Haven't you seen him?

698
00:49:54,787 --> 00:49:55,997
He left last night?

699
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,874
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

700
00:49:57,957 --> 00:50:00,585
I was supposed to leave this evening.

701
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:02,504
But the monsters wrecked my car.

702
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:07,675
Well, the only thing I want is my show
and an explanation from Wes. Come on.

703
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:09,802
- Where are we going?
- To the sheriff's office.

704
00:50:09,886 --> 00:50:11,763
You can tell him about your monsters.

705
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:13,765
You can put your hands down now.

706
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:04,107
- Morning, Alex.
- Good morning, Jesse.

707
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,526
Did you get that little outfit in Paris?

708
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:09,904
I guess the boots do look
kind of silly with a bathrobe.

709
00:51:09,988 --> 00:51:12,615
Aw, I think it looks kind of cute
on you, Alex.

710
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:15,076
What time did you get in last night, lady?

711
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:17,495
I remember you woke me up
and said something

712
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:20,373
about the sheriff
taking a woman out of Wes's cabin.

713
00:51:20,456 --> 00:51:22,208
It was close to midnight.

714
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,460
But I'm afraid you're not gonna be
very happy with me

715
00:51:24,544 --> 00:51:26,838
- when I tell you what I did.
- What did you do?

716
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:29,549
Well, while I was missing
our dinner engagement last night,

717
00:51:29,632 --> 00:51:31,843
I asked the sheriff to find Wes for me.

718
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:34,846
What's so wrong about that?
You needed to find your show.

719
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:37,056
Besides, Peter and Andrew never showed up.

720
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,809
They've eaten my cooking before.
It's pretty bad.

721
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:42,854
- But it's another thing.
- Besides my cooking?

722
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:45,523
- No, I mean about Wes.
- What about him?

723
00:51:45,607 --> 00:51:47,942
Well, when they find Wes,
I'm gonna fire him.

724
00:51:48,026 --> 00:51:50,111
- I figured that.
- You did?

725
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:52,572
Of course.
And I'm a little disappointed, Jesse.

726
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:53,948
I was sure that you would be.

727
00:51:54,032 --> 00:51:55,992
- I know he's your nephew and--
- Now, wait a minute.

728
00:51:56,075 --> 00:51:59,662
I was disappointed,
because as an intelligent young lady,

729
00:51:59,746 --> 00:52:02,415
you should have fired him a long time ago,

730
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:05,960
along with
that lazy business manager of yours.

731
00:52:06,044 --> 00:52:09,547
I sure hope your aim
is better than your business sense.

732
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:20,308
Oh, get this thing, will you?
I've got to get ready for work.

733
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:23,227
Tell whoever it is
I've dropped dead or I just left.

734
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:30,693
Hello? Hello?

735
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,182
Oh! My!

736
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:04,143
You have just all sorts
of interesting apparel, don't you?

737
00:53:04,227 --> 00:53:05,853
Jesse, please!

738
00:53:05,937 --> 00:53:07,647
Okay, Alex.

739
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,524
That was the sheriff on the phone.

740
00:53:09,607 --> 00:53:12,193
He said some men called
and reported finding my show.

741
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:15,279
- Good. Now, get out.
- But it's odd.

742
00:53:15,363 --> 00:53:17,365
They found it not far from here.

743
00:53:17,448 --> 00:53:19,867
That woman said Wes left
night before last.

744
00:53:19,951 --> 00:53:22,537
Now, why would he stop and camp
so close to his cabin?

745
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,206
Wes is completely irresponsible.

746
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:27,750
- Couldn't the sheriff tell you anything?
- No.

747
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:31,421
The men called in from the car.
They're investigating now.

748
00:53:31,504 --> 00:53:35,174
I think, if it's all right, I'll take
Mr. Stud and ride and meet them.

749
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:38,386
Good. Now, get out.

750
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:41,347
Unless, of course,
you want to wash my back!

751
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:44,350
Which is not a bad idea.
How old are you, girl?

752
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:56,571
Jesse Jamison. Hey, I've heard of him.

753
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:04,620
I wonder why whoever did this
didn't take that guy's money.

754
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,670
Bob, I'm gonna follow this trail
until the big boys get here.

755
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:15,590
Don't go too far.
They'll be turning up here any minute.

756
00:54:15,673 --> 00:54:16,883
Yeah, I know.

757
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:31,689
Excuse me, miss.
We're conducting an investigation here.

758
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:33,858
I'm gonna have to ask you
to move on along.

759
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:35,443
- Where's the rest of my show?
- Pardon?

760
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:38,029
Half my show is missing.
Where's the rest of it?

761
00:54:38,112 --> 00:54:40,490
- I don't know.
- The sheriff's not here yet?

762
00:54:40,573 --> 00:54:44,535
No, ma'am. He should be here soon.
But he had to wait on the coroner.

763
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:47,246
- The coroner!
- Yes, ma'am. They won't be long.

764
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,623
The coroner?

765
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:50,666
Oh, ma'am, I'm-- I'm sorry.

766
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,377
Since you were here,
I figured he told you.

767
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:56,714
Wes. Where is he?

768
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:58,090
Where is Wes?

769
00:54:58,174 --> 00:55:01,594
Over there in the front seat.
But I don't think you wanna look in there.

770
00:55:02,428 --> 00:55:03,471
Oh...

771
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,641
- You're not his girl, are you?
- No.

772
00:55:06,724 --> 00:55:08,601
I'm Jesse Jamison.

773
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:11,187
He worked for me. Sometimes.

774
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:53,604
Hey. What are you doing out there?

775
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:56,148
What the hell does it look like I'm doing?

776
00:55:56,232 --> 00:55:57,900
I ain't mowing the yard.

777
00:55:57,984 --> 00:55:59,902
I ain't cooking out on the grill.

778
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:02,613
And I sure as hell
ain't driving in my Chevrolet.

779
00:56:02,697 --> 00:56:05,616
- Do you have a permit?
- What kind of permit?

780
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,161
- A fishing license.
- Why don't you come out here and check?

781
00:56:10,371 --> 00:56:13,916
Now, look, old man.
We're conducting a murder investigation.

782
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,918
Now bring that boat over here.

783
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:18,671
Suck worms. I'm a-travelin' on.

784
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:20,965
Now, wait a minute. Hey, listen.

785
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:25,678
There are footprints coming in and out
from the water's edge, right here.

786
00:56:25,761 --> 00:56:29,807
I need to get to the other side to see
if the killer came in from over there.

787
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:32,351
There might be a trail
to tell us where he came from.

788
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:36,814
Now, if you cooperate
and paddle me over to the other side,

789
00:56:36,898 --> 00:56:39,191
I won't hassle you, okay?

790
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:42,987
- Footprints?
- Right. They lead to the victim's car.

791
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:47,199
I need to get to the other side and see
if I can find out where they came from.

792
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:50,786
Well, what if your killer
went on downstream?

793
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,039
That's what I need to find out.

794
00:56:53,122 --> 00:56:55,541
Hmm.

795
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,336
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, I don't see no footprints.

796
00:56:58,419 --> 00:56:59,754
Now, look--

797
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:02,214
Oh, my God!

798
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:06,719
Come in, 01.

799
00:57:08,429 --> 00:57:09,472
Matt?

800
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:13,100
Dumbass. Never could use a walkie-talkie.

801
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:50,888
Come on, boy. Let's go.

802
00:57:50,972 --> 00:57:53,683
It doesn't feel very safe around here.

803
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:16,015
- Are you all right?
- No! Let's get out of here!

804
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:17,349
Wait! Help me walk!

805
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:18,809
It's the least I can do.

806
00:59:18,893 --> 00:59:20,352
- Where's your horse?
- He ran away.

807
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:23,939
- Yeah, well, call him!
- Who do you think I am, the Lone Ranger?

808
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:26,734
<i>Police are asking
local residents to be on the lookout</i>

809
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:29,361
<i>for three men believed to be dressed
in skin diving suits,</i>

810
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:32,782
<i>suspected of committing a rash
of county murders over the past two days.</i>

811
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:35,493
<i>In addition, authorities believe
one of the divers is responsible</i>

812
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:38,662
<i>for yesterday's attack
and sexual assault of a college student.</i>

813
00:59:38,746 --> 00:59:41,457
<i>Based on descriptions provided
by surviving attack victims,</i>

814
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,251
<i>rumors of Bigfoot creatures
have begun to circulate.</i>

815
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:46,420
<i>However, authorities believe
the huge footprints</i>

816
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:48,589
<i>to have been caused
by some type of flippers</i>

817
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:51,217
<i>the skin divers were wearing
when the attacks were made.</i>

818
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,636
<i>That's news to this hour.
Now back to more music.</i>

819
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,346
Jesse, what's going on?

820
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:59,517
The place is like a booby trap,
with string and pots and pans.

821
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,311
You'll have to forgive my paranoia, Alex.

822
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:05,648
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to sleep
without some kind of an alarm.

823
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:08,317
Well, where did you get the idea for this?

824
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,152
From an old Western movie?

825
01:00:10,236 --> 01:00:13,697
I've never done anything like this before,
but I have to get some sleep.

826
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,407
I've got a show tomorrow.

827
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:19,120
Jesse, do you think you can do a show
with most of your guns stolen?

828
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:20,371
I'd better be able to.

829
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:24,166
The Diamond Agency people
will be watching me very carefully.

830
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:27,711
Tomorrow is
my final backwoods performance.

831
01:00:27,795 --> 01:00:30,381
And if I don't come through
and look really good,

832
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,466
I'm afraid they'll go back
to Mrs. Diamond,

833
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:35,511
and there goes my star-studded contract.

834
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:38,097
Well, Jesse, if there's anything
you can use in my store,

835
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,307
- you're more than welcome to it.
- Thank you, Alex.

836
01:00:40,391 --> 01:00:43,144
This is really something.

837
01:00:43,227 --> 01:00:48,524
Alex, that thing couldn't breathe
when Peter broke the tank tube.

838
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:50,776
Peter thinks they're from another world.

839
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,404
"From another world"?

840
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:57,158
Do you realize how far advanced
a person would have to be

841
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:59,451
in order to come in from outer space?

842
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:04,999
It's not rational to think
that it would be so barbaric and terrible

843
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:06,667
as the thing that attacked you.

844
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,255
If the human race is any example, Alex,
then I think it's quite rational.

845
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:14,383
Well, get some sleep, doll.

846
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,010
- Good night.
- Good night.

847
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:33,068
Oh, hell, I forgot my damn ladder.

848
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:37,907
Damn truck.
Cause you to talk in a high voice.

849
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:53,964
- Oh, excuse me!
- Oh!

850
01:01:54,048 --> 01:01:55,424
- Sorry.
- That's perfectly all right.

851
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:57,384
- Are you looking for Alex?
- Yeah. Is he home?

852
01:01:57,468 --> 01:02:00,471
- Yeah, go on in.
- Well, thank you. Oh.

853
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,060
Sheesh.

854
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:14,652
What in the hell is going on around here?

855
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:19,740
I'm sorr-- sorry about that, Luger.

856
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:22,117
But if any of those outlaws
had come around,

857
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:23,369
we'd have sure heard them.

858
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,996
Well, I'm real, real impressed.

859
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,916
How did you get so tangled up in this?

860
01:02:28,999 --> 01:02:31,335
- Damned if I know.
- Your name is Luger?

861
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,379
Well, it sure as hell ain't B--

862
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:35,631
Come on, help me
get the hell out of this mess.

863
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,092
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're going the wrong way.

864
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:40,427
- You gotta go this way.
- Wait! Wait!

865
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:43,264
I wonder if Mr. Stud came back last night.

866
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:44,890
- He wouldn't come here.
- Why not?

867
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:48,519
Whenever he gets loose,
he goes to George's filling station.

868
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:50,854
They feed him like
he was an elephant down there.

869
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:56,568
Well, I think I'll check on him
before I leave.

870
01:02:56,652 --> 01:02:57,736
He won't be there.

871
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:01,156
He likes George's food
a lot better than he likes mine.

872
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,409
By the way, did you finish breakfast?

873
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:05,286
Sure did. It was awful.

874
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,789
- I gotta get a cook.
- You sure as hell have.

875
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,835
I'll help you if you'll just hold still!

876
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:15,087
Wait, wait, wait!

877
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,464
You're pulling my arm! Just wait a minute!

878
01:03:24,138 --> 01:03:25,639
Mr. Stud?

879
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:28,726
Mr. Stud?

880
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:31,770
He's not there, right?

881
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:34,189
- No, he isn't.
- See, I told you.

882
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:37,359
He knows where the food is.

883
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,548
- Well, Jesse.
- Well, Alex.

884
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:02,134
I can't say the last couple of days
have been fun.

885
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,635
Neither can I.

886
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:05,429
But when things get back to normal,

887
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:08,807
I hope you'll figure this is a good place
to spend a few days once in a while.

888
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,893
I'm sure that I will, Alex.

889
01:04:10,976 --> 01:04:13,228
Of course, I have to come back
for Wes's funeral.

890
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:17,441
You're not having guilt feelings about
what those monsters are doing, are you?

891
01:04:17,524 --> 01:04:19,234
Oh, only a little.

892
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:22,446
You know, running off
to protect my career, that kind of thing.

893
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:25,574
Listen, young lady,
your career is important.

894
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:28,660
You're not the police
and it's not your responsibility

895
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:30,704
to go around looking for hobgoblins.

896
01:04:30,788 --> 01:04:32,956
Maybe not. I don't know.

897
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,542
You know, I just came
to work out my credit problem,

898
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:38,337
not to learn
some new self-defense technique.

899
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:41,006
Well, we were just stringing you
up a little bit, Luger.

900
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:43,926
You sure did look funny.

901
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:54,770
Now, Jesse, drive slow.
You've got plenty of time.

902
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:58,107
And when you get to the filling station,
be sure and give me a call.

903
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,734
I'd like to know if Mr. Stud
got in all right.

904
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:03,278
Sure thing, Alex.

905
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:32,474
- Hey, cowgirl.
- Hi.

906
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:40,566
Have you been eating candy?

907
01:05:41,525 --> 01:05:45,237
Uh, candy. Ah, yes, ma'am.

908
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,114
Looks like a thoroughbred bar.

909
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:52,244
Do you know what this is?

910
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,248
That's a motor, ma'am.

911
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:58,792
Do you know what's wrong with this?

912
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:04,465
Oh, you lost a belt.

913
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:07,259
Yeah, your battery will discharge
unless you get another one.

914
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:08,927
Do you have another one like it?

915
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:16,143
Uh, let me ask George. George!

916
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:29,031
Well, hello again, Mr. Chicken.

917
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:31,658
You ran out on us yesterday.

918
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,619
It's okay. I can't blame you.

919
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:36,079
You look good.

920
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:38,499
- How are you, Miss Jamison?
- I'm fine, thank you.

921
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:41,543
Listen, we can't afford
to carry all size belts up here.

922
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:44,671
We're gonna have to do a little doctoring
to get this belt to fit your car.

923
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:48,091
Well, can you just fix something for me
so I can drive a few miles?

924
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:50,719
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'll fix you right up.

925
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:52,679
I'll take care of this personally,
Miss Jamison.

926
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:55,390
Thank you. Oh, and could I use your phone?

927
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:57,434
I'd like to call Alex about Mr. Stud.

928
01:06:57,518 --> 01:06:59,144
Certainly. Go right inside.

929
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:00,771
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

930
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:11,782
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

931
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:49,403
Damn timing.

932
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:51,613
Get all settled down with a good book,

933
01:07:51,697 --> 01:07:54,408
first thing that happens,
damn phone rings.

934
01:07:56,994 --> 01:07:58,870
Uh...

935
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:00,247
- Hello?
- Luger.

936
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,960
- I was afraid that--
- <i>Afraid? Wh--</i>

937
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,087
Well, no, no, I just--

938
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,881
Well, it's just a little bother.

939
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:24,730
Well, it took you so long
to answer the phone.

940
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:28,942
Uh, um, well, you can rest assured
everything's just fine here.

941
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:30,986
It's just the timing is a little off.

942
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:34,031
You see, I was--
Well, I was kind of indisposed.

943
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:38,160
<i>Luger?</i>

944
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:40,454
Luger?

945
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,122
Luger?

946
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:45,208
<i>Luger?</i>

947
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:48,795
<i>Luger?</i>

948
01:09:07,105 --> 01:09:08,690
Shit, Shit, shit.

949
01:09:14,988 --> 01:09:17,074
Shit.

950
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,499
What's wrong? What's happening?

951
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:33,924
Be careful!

952
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:36,510
Whoo! Go get 'em, girl!

953
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:50,941
What the hell is that thing?

954
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:59,825
I gotta get out of here.

955
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:07,290
Uh, just hold on a minute out there, guy.

956
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:10,502
If you wanna use the toilet,
I'll be out in ten minutes.

957
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:20,220
Oh, hell, I'm just gonna go.

958
01:10:39,197 --> 01:10:41,158
Oh, he's a persistent sucker.

959
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:19,529
Run, Luger!

960
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:32,417
- Run, Luger!
- Hell!

961
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:39,925
For God's sake, run!

962
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,514
Come on, Alex. You get out of here, boy.

963
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:53,939
No! Whoa!

964
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:12,582
What?

965
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:50,078
Give 'em hell, Jesse!

966
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:56,918
Aim for the tank.

967
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:01,715
Ride on, you devils.

968
01:13:07,888 --> 01:13:12,142
That a way, girl! Way to go!
I mean, really give it to them!

969
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,395
I'll get some ammunition.

970
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:29,117
Jesse, the horse rides double just fine.
Why don't I come with you?

971
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,786
Sorry, Alex. I need the practice.

972
01:13:32,954 --> 01:13:34,039
Be careful, girl!

973
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:37,083
Way to kill him, girl!
I appreciate it! I owe you one!

974
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,820
What happened, Alex?
Did your grill catch on fire?

975
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:09,282
- Oh, that's cute.
- Just shooting off a few firecrackers.

976
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:10,951
You know that's against the law here.

977
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:15,163
Oh, well, I feel so much safer now.
I mean, now that the cavalry's here.

978
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:15,223
What the fuck is this?

979
01:15:27,652 --> 01:15:29,320
Yes, sir. We'll stay positioned here.

980
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,322
But you better get most of your men
in this area.

981
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:33,575
That woman is supposedly chasing
two of the guys now.

982
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:35,243
<i>One's tank exploded?</i>

983
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:37,245
I don't know.
I don't think they really killed one.

984
01:15:37,328 --> 01:15:38,830
You know what fear and panic do to people.

985
01:15:38,913 --> 01:15:40,999
I'm sure Alex thought the woman
shot one of them, though.

986
01:15:41,082 --> 01:15:45,003
- <i>No body near the tank?</i>
- Uh, no, sir. No body, just a fire.

987
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:49,466
And I was a fireman for seven years.
I know what burning flesh smells like.

988
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:52,343
There's nothing here. The killer got away.

989
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:54,262
It was monstrous.

990
01:15:54,345 --> 01:15:56,097
Bigger than you and me both.

991
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:58,975
Well, maybe you and him,
but not me and you.

992
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,310
I mean, it wasn't that big.

993
01:16:00,393 --> 01:16:03,104
- Luger, you're not normal.
- I resent that!

994
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:05,565
It was a terrible-looking thing!

995
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:08,026
- Ugly as hell.
- Yes, sir.

996
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:11,154
Double ugly. Seven feet tall, at least.

997
01:16:11,237 --> 01:16:12,530
Yes, sir.

998
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,616
Oh, the hell with him, Alex.

999
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:16,326
It's obvious that he doesn't believe us.

1000
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:18,369
Well, now, wait a minute, fellers.

1001
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,538
I mean, maybe the policeman
will believe us

1002
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:23,708
when that thing walks up
and bites him on the ass.

1003
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:25,168
Hey.

1004
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:27,670
Shouldn't you be in bed
with that foot of yours?

1005
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:30,340
You think we're crazy
with our monster stories, don't you?

1006
01:16:30,423 --> 01:16:32,092
Well, uh...

1007
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:35,428
Well, it is crazy. I know.
I don't understand it.

1008
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:37,347
I mean, who are they?

1009
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:40,308
Where did they come from?
What's their game, huh?

1010
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:41,559
We're their game.

1011
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:47,565
And if we don't do something besides stand
around talking about it, we're in trouble.

1012
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:50,652
Spacemen? Coming up out of the water, huh?

1013
01:16:50,735 --> 01:16:53,238
Well, now, actually,
he'd come at me through a toilet window.

1014
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:54,447
Yes, sir.

1015
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:55,782
Coming out of the water?

1016
01:16:55,865 --> 01:16:58,368
We didn't say anything
about coming up out of the water?

1017
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,161
- Look, I was just kidding.
- Kidding!

1018
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:02,914
Why are you kidding? This is serious, boy.

1019
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:05,834
- They're supposed to be dressed alike--
- Wait a minute.

1020
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:08,753
You know, they may have
come out of the water.

1021
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:09,879
What?

1022
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:13,299
Well, then it would be obvious
where their spaceship is.

1023
01:17:13,383 --> 01:17:15,426
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1024
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:19,472
I can't believe you wouldn't have
at least checked that out.

1025
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:20,890
What is he talking about?

1026
01:18:08,062 --> 01:18:09,939
Three little bullets.

1027
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:17,739
Jesse, you've gotta stop giving
these backwoods performances.

1028
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:29,542
Hey, Peter!

1029
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,755
Do you really think
there's a spaceship out there?

1030
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:35,048
I know there is, Luger.

1031
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:36,633
I'm gonna get the shotgun.

1032
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:41,638
I'd think you were crazy
if I didn't know what happened to Jane.

1033
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:44,182
Grab a shotgun, Alex.
Come on. We're losing time.

1034
01:18:44,265 --> 01:18:47,685
Feels just like a--
It'll be just like blowing up a still.

1035
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:49,020
You stay here, Luger.

1036
01:18:49,103 --> 01:18:50,230
What? Stay here?

1037
01:18:50,313 --> 01:18:52,398
W-Wait a minute. I wanna go with you.

1038
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:58,905
But I wanted to go with you!

1039
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:02,617
Ah, shit.

1040
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:57,755
If your crazy theory is true,

1041
01:19:57,839 --> 01:20:01,801
I have serious doubt as to our ability
to blow up anything

1042
01:20:01,884 --> 01:20:04,429
that came God knows how far to get here.

1043
01:20:04,512 --> 01:20:06,597
We can sure give it a try.

1044
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:35,710
You know, I think we should be
out looking for Jesse.

1045
01:20:35,793 --> 01:20:38,212
I'm not too sure
we're doing the right thing at all.

1046
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:41,841
Alex, I wish you'd stop doubting me.
You're beginning to sound like the police.

1047
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:44,427
Listen, can you handle that stuff?

1048
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:47,847
- Look, have a little faith.
- I have very little faith.

1049
01:20:47,930 --> 01:20:50,141
I'm not too sure
you know how to handle that stuff.

1050
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:51,225
Well, I do.

1051
01:20:51,309 --> 01:20:53,978
It takes somebody
that has been studying it, you know?

1052
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:56,147
What did you bring the fishing rod for?

1053
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:58,191
Well, you're good with it.

1054
01:20:58,274 --> 01:21:00,360
I brought what was there.
What are you gonna do?

1055
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:02,862
- Is this the spot?
- It looks like it.

1056
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:09,827
I'm gonna take the line and run it back
over there along with the box.

1057
01:21:09,911 --> 01:21:11,371
Hang on a minute.

1058
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:17,752
Hold the wire.

1059
01:21:20,046 --> 01:21:23,257
Peter, you better know
what you're doing, boy!

1060
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:06,551
Peter, when you're working with powder,
you have to do it in the right sequence.

1061
01:22:06,634 --> 01:22:09,512
Now, are you sure
you've got it in the right order?

1062
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,473
Hey, Alex. Look!

1063
01:22:12,557 --> 01:22:14,475
Hey, Jesse! Jesse!

1064
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:16,227
Over here! Hey!

1065
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,521
Quiet, Peter. You'll wake up your monster.

1066
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:20,440
Don't worry about a thing, Jesse.

1067
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:22,859
We've got everything
under control right here.

1068
01:22:22,942 --> 01:22:26,863
Peter, you make too much noise
to be a good hunter.

1069
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:32,118
Oh, hell.

1070
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:37,915
Oh, my God.

1071
01:22:43,588 --> 01:22:45,756
He's a dead one now, Jesse! I got him!

1072
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,300
You better be fast.

1073
01:22:50,261 --> 01:22:51,429
Well, come on!

1074
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:55,600
It's not working, Alex!

1075
01:22:55,683 --> 01:22:57,810
I knew you didn't know
what you were doing.

1076
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,260
Alex!

1077
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,936
Alex!

1078
01:23:45,858 --> 01:23:47,652
Thank God you're here.
Let me have that gun.

1079
01:23:47,735 --> 01:23:49,654
- Alex, no.
- I think I can get him.

1080
01:23:49,737 --> 01:23:51,781
There are only three bullets.

1081
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:57,328
- Please, Alex.
- Get him in a hurry.

1082
01:23:57,411 --> 01:23:58,538
He's killing Peter.

1083
01:23:59,247 --> 01:24:00,414
Alex!

1084
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:14,679
Hang on, Peter.

1085
01:24:30,069 --> 01:24:32,780
- You'll take him, all right.
- Shoot him!

1086
01:24:32,863 --> 01:24:34,532
You can hit him!

1087
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,743
Shoot him! Shoot him, Jesse!

1088
01:24:37,827 --> 01:24:39,954
I'm sorry, Peter. I just can't do it.

1089
01:24:40,037 --> 01:24:41,330
Kill him!

1090
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:43,583
Kill him before he kills me!

1091
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:45,251
Keep your courage up. You'll take him.

1092
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:48,129
I just have three bullets left, Alex.

1093
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:51,215
Even if I'm faster,
it'll never take him down.

1094
01:24:51,299 --> 01:24:55,428
- I wish he'd just back up and walk away.
- He's not gonna do it.

1095
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:04,228
I think he wants you
to holster your gun, Jesse.

1096
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:06,480
Maybe he just wants to get away.

1097
01:25:06,564 --> 01:25:09,358
If he puts his gun away,
you holster yours.

1098
01:25:09,442 --> 01:25:11,902
It's suicide. Don't do it, Jesse.

1099
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:13,821
No!

1100
01:25:17,366 --> 01:25:20,036
It's not worth it, Jesse! No!

1101
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:29,170
How about that? Bilateral disarmament.

1102
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:45,561
Aim for the tank, Jesse.

1103
01:25:45,645 --> 01:25:49,523
Look at him, Alex.
He remembers what happened at your house.

1104
01:25:49,607 --> 01:25:51,776
He'll never turn his back to me.

1105
01:25:51,859 --> 01:25:52,985
He don't have to.

1106
01:26:11,837 --> 01:26:15,007
Come on. You can take him, Jesse.

1107
01:26:15,091 --> 01:26:17,009
But I've never been fast, Alex.

1108
01:26:17,093 --> 01:26:19,929
You don't have to be fast to be good,
and you're good.

1109
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,223
I've never been fast.

1110
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,148
Aim careful, Jesse.

1111
01:26:31,899 --> 01:26:33,859
I wanna watch him die.

1112
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:46,038
Alex!

1113
01:26:53,504 --> 01:26:55,172
Alex!

1114
01:26:56,006 --> 01:26:58,008
Jesse! Dynamite!

1115
01:26:59,635 --> 01:27:01,679
Blow him to hell, Jesse!

1116
01:27:03,431 --> 01:27:04,473
Aim careful.

1117
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:39,467
I knew I'd watch that bastard burn.

1118
01:27:48,809 --> 01:27:50,311
Way to distract him.

1119
01:27:52,146 --> 01:27:54,440
Now I'll never know who's the fastest.

1120
01:27:54,523 --> 01:27:57,777
That's all right, boy.
Now you know who's the best.
