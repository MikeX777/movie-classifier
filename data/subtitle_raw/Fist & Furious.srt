<i>Dongjin TV's videographer
Gook-hyun Nam?</i>

5
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,999
<i>I heard you're digging
around for an exclusive.</i>

6
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,711
<i>I got a kickass tip, you want it?</i>

7
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:45,257
<i>It's about a dirty cop
who took out loans from me,</i>

8
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,845
<i>his name is Ki-man Kang.</i>

9
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:53,392
Det. Kim, let me ask you a favor.

10
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:57,105
Lend me some money.

11
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:59,525
Just for a week, if it's too much.

12
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,821
Don't lie to me, Mr. Park.

13
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,034
I know your bar is doing well.

14
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:09,830
<i>Asshole, where's my damn money?!</i>

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,336
Don't just say no! Hello?

16
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:17,923
Hello? Hello?

17
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:25,850
Fucker, pay back the principal
and the interest in a week!

18
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:28,311
Or I'll fucking kill you!

19
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:37,447
<i>He was a hotshot cop
who took on big cases.</i>

20
00:01:37,615 --> 00:01:41,452
<i>Then he got hooked on
gambling while on a case?</i>

21
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:45,875
<i>Right! Then he messed
with a narco units case.</i>

22
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,546
<i>The drugs were made by Tae-hwa Jung.</i>

23
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:53,718
<i>He's infamous for selling
hybrid drugs in Gangnam.</i>

24
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:58,599
<i>Kang shot him after trying
to stab him while high.</i>

25
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:03,396
<i>I don't know who Jung's informant is,</i>

26
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:06,275
<i>but he heard about Kang's plan.</i>

27
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,237
<i>Crocodile Bird.</i>

28
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,200
Wow, first call in a year.

29
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:17,122
I heard you went bust with
stocks, it must be true then.

30
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,127
Steal from me?

31
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,882
Cops do something so low nowadays?

32
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:26,717
I understand.

33
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:30,931
I'll send you a large one
for giving me this exclusive.

34
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:34,519
Sure, take care.

35
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:48,453
Young-dae.

36
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:52,166
That cop's on the way
to steal our package.

37
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:57,255
<i>Things got complicated when
a rookie was assigned to Kang.</i>

38
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,759
You got a new rookie partner.

39
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:01,594
Salute! I'm Jae-ho Yoon!

40
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:07,810
<i>Det. Kang! Deadline is
tomorrow, don't be late!</i>

41
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,689
What is that?

42
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,904
Det. Kang.

43
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,282
Do you remember me?

44
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:23,455
The goalkeeper from Gupabal
warehouse 5 years ago.

45
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:33,092
Det. Kang, are you sure it's here?

46
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:36,179
We got no warrant,
we could be in trouble.

47
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:42,061
Open your eyes wide and watch, got it?

48
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:45,858
See how you lose an ankle
for not cooperating.

49
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,860
Grab him!

50
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,075
Cops!

51
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,078
It's a raid!

52
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:57,873
Cops!

53
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,386
Wait a minute.

54
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:17,389
Detective...

55
00:05:17,724 --> 00:05:19,850
Thank you for saving me.

56
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,565
Could you tell me your name?

57
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,941
I'll pay you a visit.

58
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,069
Just get well, asshole.

59
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,794
I gave up soccer after that injury.

60
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,757
After the academy,
I worked as a patrolman,

61
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:48,177
and requested transfer when
I found out you were here.

62
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:55,603
Det. Park said you were the
best cop in Mapo Police.

63
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,818
I lost my touch a long time ago.

64
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,573
So ask for another partner.

65
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:16,004
But I still want to learn from you

66
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,175
I may be a novice, could you teach me?

67
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:30,397
<i>Say hi to daddy!</i>

68
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,648
<i>Will you be late?</i>

69
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:33,276
Yeah, probably.

70
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,112
Honey, say hello to Det. Ki-man Kang!

71
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,739
<i>Hello!</i>

72
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,910
<i>Are you free this Sunday?</i>

73
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:46,334
<i>It's our daughter's first
birthday, please come for lunch.</i>

74
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:51,840
- I'll call you later!
- <i>Honey!</i>

75
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:54,510
She's a bit immature.

76
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:58,265
But I'll give you an
invitation just in case.

77
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,992
Why are we here?

78
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:16,162
I'll be right back, standby here.

79
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,207
Yes, sir!

80
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,497
My baby...

81
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,668
Come here, bud.

82
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:48,061
Kill him!

83
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,651
Grab him! Go!

84
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,506
Son of a bitch!

85
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,897
You bastard!

86
00:12:19,835 --> 00:12:22,837
Det. Kang! Sir!

87
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,676
Just go!

88
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,231
Asshole!

89
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:43,146
<i>His partner Det. Yoon died on the spot.</i>

90
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:46,233
<i>And Jung lost his precious lieutenant.</i>

91
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:53,159
<i>When the narcos raided the place,</i>

92
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:55,537
<i>Jung was long gone.</i>

93
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:59,458
Find the switch! Turn the lights on!

94
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:02,253
We're so fucked! They aren't here!

95
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:04,131
Find the switch.

96
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:05,382
Motherfuckers!

97
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,227
The chance of damaging the
brain artery is too high.

98
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,522
Then can he lead a normal life?

99
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,150
I'm not sure...

100
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:23,488
One thing's for sure, the knife
will stay inside his head.

101
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,741
Until the day he die.

102
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,205
When I got to he scene, Jung had fled,

103
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:32,750
and Yoon was dead

104
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:36,713
I found out that they
were working together.

105
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:38,841
You didn't know, right?

106
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:42,220
Jung bought him up when
Yoon was a patrolman.

107
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:45,933
A bag full of money was
found inside Yoon's desk

108
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:49,729
and he was killed while
trying to steal Jung's drugs.

109
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,734
Who stabbed you, Det. Kang?

110
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:57,281
Was it Det. Yoon or Tae-hwa Jung?

111
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:04,289
Det. Jae-ho Yoon

112
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,087
I'm absolutely sure it was Det. Yoon.

113
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:11,674
Very well.

114
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,847
<i>In Mourning</i>

115
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:23,355
With the investigation over,
allow me to speak freely.

116
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,774
Don't you think this is too much?

117
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:30,155
Without much evidence you
put all the blame on Yoon?!

118
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,114
Hey, watch it!

119
00:15:31,157 --> 00:15:32,366
You know Jae-ho,

120
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,161
does this sound like something he'd do?

121
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:36,955
This is all bullshit!

122
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:39,667
You can throw him under
the bus because he's dead!

123
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:40,334
Enough!

124
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:42,879
Burying this won't turn it into truth!

125
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,506
You know better than anyone!

126
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:45,925
That's enough, asshole!

127
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,344
Dude, he died because of you,

128
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:51,098
You assigned him to this team!

129
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,850
How could I have known, you bastard!

130
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,187
You killed him, why did you do it?!

131
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,689
How could I have known?!

132
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,109
He died because of you!

133
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:23,680
<i>Eun-jae's First Birthday!</i>

134
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:34,944
<i>I was standing on the edge of a knife.</i>

135
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,908
<i>When I fell over,</i>

136
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:46,292
<i>the knife didn't lodge
in my head, but my heart.</i>

137
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:50,881
<i>Can handle this?</i>

138
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:55,011
<i>Mr. Tipster don't worry about that</i>

139
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:57,472
<i>just gave me Kang's address.</i>

140
00:16:57,932 --> 00:17:00,726
This is the place.

141
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:06,108
This is where a man who lived
3 years with a knife in his head.

142
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,739
I'll ring the bell now.

143
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:16,538
I'm excited to see how he looks now.

144
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,844
Hello?

145
00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:31,974
Anyone home?

146
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,984
I don't think anyone's here.

147
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,822
Where the hell did he go?

148
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:47,535
No phone number, no nothing.

149
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:57,214
Why is she pestering me?

150
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:02,262
Yes, Producer Hong.

151
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:06,851
<i>Nam, return the camera
and empty your locker!</i>

152
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,354
You're overreacting.

153
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,030
<i>The dip is the cruel part</i>

154
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:19,825
I'm bringing in a major story!

155
00:18:19,826 --> 00:18:21,494
This one's huge!

156
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:24,164
- <i>Like hell it is.</i>
- It's a blockbuster!

157
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:26,167
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>

158
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:29,212
- Ms. Hong.
- <i>What?</i>

159
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:33,259
This guy has a knife lodge in his head!

160
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,427
<i>So he's dead?</i>

161
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:37,264
Nonsense, I'm here to meet him.

162
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:39,266
- <i>For real?</i>
- Yeah

163
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:43,021
I'll show you the footages, I gotta go.

164
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,690
Yeah.

165
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:47,610
She pesters me so much...

166
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:51,490
Holy cow! Jesus!

167
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,951
Are you here to meet the man here?

168
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:55,954
I am.

169
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,123
Get him to the mental ward ASAP!

170
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:02,504
He' screams every night,
smashes everything in sight!

171
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:06,634
We can't even report him
because we're all scared of him!

172
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:09,346
Excuse me.

173
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:10,847
- About this man...
- What the shit?

174
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,141
How long was he like this?

175
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:14,560
Are you filming me?

176
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,483
When was it? I'm not 100% certain,

177
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:21,861
but over a year, I think...

178
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:29,579
Wait, are you Det. Ki-man Kang?

179
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:30,956
Wait a minute!

180
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:35,587
I'm Gook-hyun Nam, a
videographer from Dongjin TV.

181
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,190
I heard you got a knife in your head,

182
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,152
did it happen 3 years ago...

183
00:20:01,912 --> 00:20:03,914
You son of a bitch!

184
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:12,341
Goddammit!

185
00:20:12,676 --> 00:20:13,926
Son of a bitch!

186
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:24,815
Come at me, let's get this over with!

187
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,542
Fucking hell...

188
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:44,840
Come out!

189
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:47,510
Come out, asshole!

190
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,806
Get out of there!

191
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:54,102
How dare you mess with my pride!

192
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:56,855
You embarrassed me.

193
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:05,074
4532...

194
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:09,120
You've met your match, fucker.

195
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:19,925
You bastard!

196
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,387
What the hell?

197
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:23,972
What's up?!

198
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:25,307
What's wrong with you?

199
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,226
Hey!

200
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:30,147
What?

201
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,566
What? This?

202
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,193
Give you a shot?

203
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,029
Fucking tell me!

204
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,743
Fuck this...

205
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,716
Goddammit!

206
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,804
Boot up!

207
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,485
Holy fucking shit...

208
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,028
<i>Give me a call.</i>

209
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:56,463
<i>How did it happen to Det. Kang?</i>

210
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,925
<i>He had a rookie partner,</i>

211
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:02,011
<i>named Jae-ho Yoon.</i>

212
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:06,308
<i>He was working for a drug kingpin,
and Det. Kang caught him!</i>

213
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,311
<i>When my husband was alive,</i>

214
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:13,192
<i>he made this to show the guests.</i>

215
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:18,157
<i>Det. Ki-man Kang, thank you
for coming to the party.</i>

216
00:23:18,158 --> 00:23:24,832
<i>Since I'm a novice I thought
I'd be a burden to you...</i>

217
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:26,834
<i>Please be patient with...</i>

218
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:34,427
Do you always throw
punches instinctually?

219
00:23:34,428 --> 00:23:37,514
It's a good thing I can take a beating,

220
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,850
you could've killed someone.

221
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,144
Are you from North Korea?

222
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,647
Why is it important where I'm from?

223
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:48,152
Yeah, it's been 15
years since I defected.

224
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,865
Why did you defect?

225
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:56,955
Yeah, I ask myself that lately.

226
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:59,291
I should've gone elsewhere.

227
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:01,377
Family?

228
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:15,562
When did you start this work?

229
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:19,233
When I was 20 or so...

230
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:23,613
I worked for a private detective agency.

231
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:27,994
It was always about
chasing down affairs.

232
00:24:27,995 --> 00:24:32,166
I did this and that and
ended up doing this.

233
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:37,506
My life deserves a 5-part
documentary series.

234
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:42,554
Why am I opening up myself to you?

235
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,850
We're here, this is it.

236
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:48,102
- Thank you.
- Bye.

237
00:24:48,145 --> 00:24:51,523
- Please come again!
- Okay!

238
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:08,169
I'm scared because of Eun-jae.

239
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,797
I don't want her to
remember him as a bad guy.

240
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:12,466
Want me to film you?

241
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,728
You know what happened, right?

242
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:27,902
What people are saying,
they're all lies, no?

243
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:35,036
I know it'll be hard, but
try to forget everything.

244
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,789
How could I, when he died like that?

245
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:40,626
Somebody...

246
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,505
will tell me the truth...

247
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,229
Wasn't that kid adorable?

248
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:59,900
It'd have looked good
if you hugged her.

249
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:05,741
It's a bit blunt, but
that's what people want.

250
00:26:06,118 --> 00:26:07,660
Come on...

251
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:10,873
I just feel bad about it.

252
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,377
Where are you going?!

253
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,673
I had an inkling it'd be here.

254
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:20,718
You should just forget it.

255
00:26:20,928 --> 00:26:26,475
If you want to live in Korea,
you gotta forget quickly.

256
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:32,566
Do you still want to report about me?

257
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:36,029
Sure, I do.

258
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,034
Then start recording, from here on.

259
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:45,708
Why the sudden generosity?

260
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:48,837
It'll be my pleasure.

261
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:55,178
Camera is rolling, you
want to say anything?

262
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:01,394
I'm gonna make him
confess with his own mouth

263
00:27:01,437 --> 00:27:05,691
that Jae-ho Yoon had
nothing to do with him.

264
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:09,863
I want everything he says
recorded on your camera

265
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:14,035
and show it to his family
and beg for her forgiveness.

266
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:19,792
Where is Jung now?

267
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:22,462
I'll have to start looking.

268
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:25,049
Wait, hold on.

269
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:33,559
I'll need some payment
for taking on such a risk.

270
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,613
Send me your bank info.

271
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,434
Det. Kang!

272
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,147
Who's that?

273
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:12,983
He'll find Jung with me.

274
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:15,862
The docs?

275
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:16,947
Oh, right.

276
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:20,451
Due to my transfer to homicide,
the only Jung file I got

277
00:28:20,452 --> 00:28:22,454
is a year old.

278
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:25,958
Yeah? This will have to do.

279
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,710
Please call me when you find him

280
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:29,713
I'll back you up.

281
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:31,715
Take care.

282
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:38,682
Who are those girls?

283
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,144
Overdose victims of Jung's drugs.

284
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:44,439
This guy is a real villain.

285
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:48,152
So they were used for clinical trial?

286
00:28:48,153 --> 00:28:50,781
Masseuse, whores, escorts,

287
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:53,826
they got anyone who needed money high.

288
00:28:53,827 --> 00:28:58,540
The drug's effects were
tested and sold it afterwards.

289
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:04,172
Wait, wait.

290
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:13,434
I can't wait to find out how
Det. Kang will investigate this case.

291
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:14,602
How will you start?

292
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:21,653
Seol-ran Choi, I'll
have to find her first.

293
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,555
You came without a reservation?

294
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:44,973
Here.

295
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:49,312
Pick out who you want to kiss.

296
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:54,318
Someone like you prefer
girls in high school uniform.

297
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:56,738
Seol-ran.

298
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:57,865
Bring her.

299
00:29:58,324 --> 00:29:59,909
What? Bring her?

300
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:00,910
What the hell?

301
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:04,957
Shit, I didn't get that!

302
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,724
Dammit...

303
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,852
Who are you?

304
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:24,231
Song-hwa Han, she ever call you?

305
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:27,276
Never.

306
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:31,407
Why are you looking for her?

307
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,451
Why're you looking for my sister?!

308
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:40,209
You're not gonna get off?

309
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:46,425
Is she deaf or what?

310
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,970
Just go.

311
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm an Uber driver, that's what.

312
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,729
Where should I take you, Mr. Kang?

313
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,731
Wonil district.

314
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,569
Oh yeah,

315
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:02,946
put this on.

316
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:04,364
Just in case I miss something.

317
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:05,491
Piss off.

318
00:31:05,492 --> 00:31:07,493
Fuck, I need the footage!

319
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:13,709
Christ!

320
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,138
- Drink!
- Yes, boss!

321
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:24,473
So adorable!

322
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:26,809
Go cook some meat, asshole.

323
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,727
Sure!

324
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:31,565
I'm so full...

325
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:38,323
What's here?

326
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:42,078
What are you looking for?

327
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:45,332
Don't look through my stuff!

328
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:48,419
Pop your trunk

329
00:31:49,338 --> 00:31:51,715
I'm not his fucking minion.

330
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:56,471
What is it?

331
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:04,356
Shit, he's got a thing
for making me invisible.

332
00:32:11,992 --> 00:32:13,868
Where are you going?!

333
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,413
Going instinctual again!

334
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:19,875
Stupid used car!

335
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:23,422
You stay right here.

336
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:26,968
Who's that?

337
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:29,179
What are you?

338
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,889
Why are you here...

339
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,100
You son of a bitch!

340
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:06,392
You bastard!

341
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,223
What the fuck?!

342
00:33:57,373 --> 00:34:00,459
Where's Jung?

343
00:34:03,256 --> 00:34:08,052
He went to fuck your
mom, motherfucker!

344
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,820
I don't know!

345
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:25,658
Last chance, spill it.

346
00:34:29,246 --> 00:34:31,081
Where's my sister?

347
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:33,125
Stop it! Please!

348
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,420
Heuksan Island, he went to Heuksan!

349
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,422
What for?

350
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,759
To smuggle out.

351
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:43,346
Those addicted to his shit

352
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:46,475
can't control themselves.

353
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:54,110
One of them happened to
be a police chief's son

354
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:56,863
so Major Crime's been on his tail

355
00:34:56,864 --> 00:35:01,119
so he's trying to smuggle
out of the country.

356
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:13,759
When are we leaving?

357
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,891
Buddy, is he a cop?

358
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:22,938
Look what he did. He's a thuggish cop.

359
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,860
Where's Mok?

360
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,863
In there.

361
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:32,908
Det. Kang, should I join you?

362
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,831
Just lock up Mok.

363
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:45,174
Request support anytime.

364
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:55,979
Yo.

365
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,066
You must've kissed thousands of guys.

366
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:01,527
What's it to you?

367
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:05,616
Do you want to kiss
someone you've just met?

368
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:09,538
You've never kissed, right?

369
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:11,540
Wanna do it?

370
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:16,087
Pay me, I'll kiss you.

371
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:22,429
This bitch bitches like a rude mofo.

372
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,640
What?

373
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,851
Are you from North Korea?

374
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,521
So what?

375
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:33,693
Why is that so fucking important?

376
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,699
Goddammit...

377
00:36:40,953 --> 00:36:43,371
I was looking for my sister.

378
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:46,083
That was the last place
where she worked.

379
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:50,172
You idiot, you thought you
could find her that way?

380
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:54,510
What was I supposed to do?
No one wanted to help.

381
00:36:55,763 --> 00:37:00,643
The world is fucked,
no one will ever help!

382
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:28,636
Very well, I'll give you
half of the package.

383
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,349
Yes, sure.

384
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:37,522
Boss, you're really
going to China?

385
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:44,156
Kang is coming to Heuksan.

386
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:46,158
To kill me.

387
00:37:46,618 --> 00:37:49,287
Why? Scared?

388
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:54,460
This is good, I wanted to
see him one more time.

389
00:37:54,461 --> 00:37:59,300
I gotta get half of my
knife in his head back

390
00:37:59,301 --> 00:38:02,470
I was curious about that.

391
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:04,848
What's so special about it?

392
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,977
My whore of a mother

393
00:38:08,771 --> 00:38:12,691
slit her wrist while addicted on drugs.

394
00:38:13,527 --> 00:38:15,612
With this knife.

395
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:24,540
All alone, I was beaten everyday
by her pimp and fled to Mokpo.

396
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,542
When I was 13.

397
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:31,340
I told myself I'd never
come back to Heuksan.

398
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:37,681
How dare those fucking chinks
get me to come back here

399
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,266
Gil-ju.

400
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:40,309
Yes, boss.

401
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,147
Ask the skipper to have
a few good men ready,

402
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:46,192
and send them to Kang as my present.

403
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,860
Right away.

404
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:54,285
But he's not coming alone.

405
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,753
What is it?

406
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:13,009
Is this how cops investigate?

407
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:15,428
It's so barbaric.

408
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:29,863
Want me to buy you one?

409
00:40:30,573 --> 00:40:32,324
Whatever.

410
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:37,122
Why stare at it all day
when you won't fucking buy?

411
00:40:37,916 --> 00:40:39,458
Is swearing all you're good at?

412
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,920
Swear at me again,
and I'll fucking kill you.

413
00:40:46,718 --> 00:40:50,555
This reminded me of the one
my sister bought for me!

414
00:40:57,982 --> 00:41:01,694
When I first arrived at the orphanage,
boys harassed me endlessly.

415
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:04,865
They'd hit me, trip me,
pull my hair everyday.

416
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:10,163
She told me to blow it
whenever they did that.

417
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:13,709
She bought it for me for that reason.

418
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,424
I still have it at home.

419
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:30,230
Have some too.

420
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:35,111
Have plenty.

421
00:41:35,112 --> 00:41:40,076
You loved my mom's chicken soup.

422
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:50,881
You ate chicken with the money
my mom sold her body for.

423
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:52,341
Was it good?

424
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:55,345
Tell me, was it?

425
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,098
Was it good?

426
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,893
Was it fucking good?!

427
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,733
Fucking gimp.

428
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:13,743
Something smells good!
I baked a sample!

429
00:42:17,165 --> 00:42:18,540
How is it?

430
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:22,128
Weak ass shit won't impress the chinks.

431
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:24,965
You'll know once you try.

432
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:30,806
Son of a bitch!

433
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,268
You fucking trash!

434
00:42:37,732 --> 00:42:39,400
I'm sorry!

435
00:42:49,664 --> 00:42:51,290
Det. Park?

436
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,462
I'm in Heuksan Island.

437
00:42:57,382 --> 00:43:00,301
It won't be easy,
but I still gotta try.

438
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:03,972
Yeah.

439
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:08,812
I'll call you when I need back up.

440
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:16,238
Mister, you okay?

441
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:18,949
- Are you sick?
- Leave him.

442
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,541
What's wrong?

443
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:28,753
The headache again?

444
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,380
Are you all right?

445
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:33,301
Buddy, he's sick, right?

446
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,681
He's got a knife wedged in his head.

447
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,475
What?

448
00:43:42,104 --> 00:43:44,314
You okay?

449
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:59,041
Why did Jung kill Det. Yoon?

450
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:00,960
You said they aren't linked in any way

451
00:44:00,961 --> 00:44:03,255
I told you he died while
trying to save him!

452
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:04,882
So he died because of you.

453
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:06,717
Right?

454
00:44:08,095 --> 00:44:11,265
You'll kill Jung when you meet him?

455
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,893
He and I will both die.

456
00:44:15,396 --> 00:44:18,857
What are you saying? You can't die!

457
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:23,488
You have to survive this
and go back to Seoul

458
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:28,286
I have to film you get
examined at a hospital!

459
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:31,457
Audience nowadays are
sensitive and experts.

460
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:34,961
No one will believe about
the knife without evidence!

461
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:37,965
So we need to have an x-ray shot,

462
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,301
and an interview with the doctor.

463
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:45,307
Then end with a piano
BGM on your face...

464
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:49,813
If you're done, get up, let's go.

465
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:55,028
Fuck, I'm invisible till the end.

466
00:44:58,158 --> 00:45:00,243
Punk ass bastard!

467
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,203
Hey!

468
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:05,165
<i>DO NOT ENTER</i>

469
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,165
Is there a room?

470
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:53,267
Granny,

471
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:55,937
why are you wiping
that pot so diligently?

472
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:58,607
This will bring us luck.

473
00:45:59,151 --> 00:46:02,779
In a bit, that inn will be mine.

474
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,577
It's all because I've
been wiping this clean.

475
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,162
I see.

476
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:17,589
Are there any Chinese ships in Heuksan?

477
00:46:17,882 --> 00:46:19,592
None.

478
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:22,888
There are a few during a storm.

479
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,743
Seol-ran...

480
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:43,330
You don't have any family?

481
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,250
They all left.

482
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:49,796
You don't miss them?

483
00:46:49,797 --> 00:46:52,091
I lost that feeling a long time ago.

484
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:55,720
A feeling isn't a lost item.

485
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:59,517
It's not something you lose.

486
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:03,230
You just feel it here,
like an instinct.

487
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:12,449
Where are you going now?

488
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:27,093
Fine, I'm used to
being an invisible man.

489
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:04,348
Take it.

490
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,479
If you meet Kang, do not hesitate.

491
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:49,988
Who are these bastards?

492
00:49:19,401 --> 00:49:20,985
Shit, we're fucked...

493
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:25,783
Where are you going?

494
00:49:25,784 --> 00:49:28,161
You stay right here.

495
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:29,538
I'll come with you!

496
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:31,540
Just stay here!

497
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:36,922
It's... dangerous outside.

498
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,929
I bought this just in case.

499
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:44,932
Use it in emergency.

500
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:50,981
And when I asked you about
the kiss in the car...

501
00:49:57,198 --> 00:50:01,661
I was so fucking immature
and you know, being dumb,

502
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:03,956
I'll apologize, I'm sorry.

503
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:08,711
This is so embarrassing...

504
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,347
Det. Kang!

505
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,643
I don't believe this, where did he go?

506
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:21,936
Det. Kang!

507
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:23,063
Detective!

508
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:26,525
Why he is always acting alone?

509
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:02,270
Who ordered you?

510
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,555
Where the hell did he go?

511
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:27,452
What's wrong?

512
00:54:27,453 --> 00:54:29,746
Hold on, let me see,
where's the shot?!

513
00:54:29,747 --> 00:54:31,915
Where's the shot?!

514
00:54:41,595 --> 00:54:43,221
Hold on, it's okay!

515
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:44,556
I'm right here, don't worry!

516
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:46,976
What's wrong?!

517
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:48,853
Come on!

518
00:54:48,896 --> 00:54:50,021
What is it?!

519
00:54:50,648 --> 00:54:51,690
It's okay, hold on

520
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:54,694
it's fine, all right?
You'll live through this!

521
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:56,905
Just hold on!

522
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:58,949
It's all right.

523
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:15,136
<i>You're here?</i>

524
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:21,144
<i>My man will meet you with the
package after killing Kang.</i>

525
00:55:21,812 --> 00:55:23,605
<i>Don't be late.</i>

526
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:22,888
Are you okay?

527
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:31,356
So why did you take off alone?

528
00:56:43,164 --> 00:56:45,291
Jung sent these men?

529
00:56:46,752 --> 00:56:49,504
Thanks for earlier.

530
00:56:55,638 --> 00:56:58,891
You actually know how to thank someone?

531
00:57:38,358 --> 00:57:40,860
Take care of Seol-ran.

532
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:03,555
What took you so long to answer?!

533
00:58:05,266 --> 00:58:08,061
Bring the package to the lighthouse.

534
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:11,315
If you're not there in an hour,
I'll have you arrested.

535
00:58:11,399 --> 00:58:13,276
Got that?

536
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:20,409
<i>Mok?</i>

537
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:26,167
<i>He was found dead
in a container in Paju.</i>

538
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:30,088
<i>It was a gas suffocation
accident or something.</i>

539
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,759
<i>Det. Park found him.</i>

540
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,223
Feed that bitch and come back,
don't stay with her too long!

541
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:41,352
Will you stop calling her bitch?!

542
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:44,356
Her name is Song-hwa.

543
00:58:44,357 --> 00:58:48,820
Jung said he'll leave her
here when he goes to China.

544
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:52,742
So I'll keep her.

545
00:58:53,285 --> 00:58:54,744
Just so you know.

546
00:58:54,745 --> 00:58:56,538
- Stupid bastard!
- That hurts!

547
00:58:56,539 --> 00:59:00,376
Jung sucked all her juice,
why do you like her?

548
00:59:00,377 --> 00:59:03,088
Throw away her stuff in the storage!

549
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:04,631
Leave those!

550
00:59:04,632 --> 00:59:08,177
If you touch them,
I'll torch this place!

551
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,111
<i>National ID Card</i>

552
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,467
Gui-su!

553
01:00:13,468 --> 01:00:15,470
Load the booze in the kitchen.

554
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:26,442
I left my truck running.

555
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:50,180
Holy shit...

556
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:52,182
Watch it!

557
01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:54,185
Hey! Hey!

558
01:01:00,694 --> 01:01:02,028
Shit...

559
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:58,724
What's wrong with this?

560
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:01,185
What the shit is wrong?!

561
01:02:08,445 --> 01:02:09,905
All right...

562
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:15,912
Answer, answer...

563
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:18,082
- Answer...
- <i>The number you are calling...</i>

564
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:20,793
I don't believe this...

565
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,339
Goddammit!

566
01:02:29,722 --> 01:02:31,640
Is this Mokpo police?

567
01:02:32,225 --> 01:02:35,270
I'm at...

568
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:43,113
Det. Kang, why are you...

569
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:47,452
So you've been colluding with Jung.

570
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:51,457
What do you mean?

571
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:57,089
<i>Kill Kang then Jung afterwards.</i>

572
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,134
<i>Half of the package is mine.</i>

573
01:03:00,135 --> 01:03:01,970
<i>You little punk.</i>

574
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:06,392
You were gonna backstab
Jung and take his package?

575
01:03:16,906 --> 01:03:18,157
Fuck...

576
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:23,246
I was gonna take the package.

577
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,103
Stupid arm...

578
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,379
Boss, they're at the meeting point.

579
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,006
Any contact from Jong-do?

580
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,132
No, not yet.

581
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:14,886
Are we taking Song-hwa?

582
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:19,183
They won't give us a boat
if we don't test the drug.

583
01:05:25,317 --> 01:05:27,360
Gui-su!

584
01:05:30,406 --> 01:05:33,743
Sell Song-hwa to me.

585
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:42,587
I can give you more money.

586
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:44,464
So sell her to me

587
01:05:44,465 --> 01:05:46,717
I'll give you more money!

588
01:05:46,718 --> 01:05:50,180
No need to raise your voice.

589
01:05:54,395 --> 01:05:57,272
Could I...

590
01:05:57,273 --> 01:06:00,318
do it with her once?

591
01:06:02,822 --> 01:06:05,157
Goddamn fuck...

592
01:06:29,772 --> 01:06:31,690
Song-hwa! Song-hwa!

593
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:35,528
Song-hwa!

594
01:06:37,031 --> 01:06:38,824
Seol-ran?

595
01:07:06,818 --> 01:07:09,321
What the shit?!

596
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:12,575
Is she nuts?!

597
01:07:13,493 --> 01:07:15,036
Gimpy fuck...

598
01:07:15,037 --> 01:07:17,664
Boss! Song-hwa escaped!

599
01:07:24,716 --> 01:07:25,674
Get up!

600
01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:42,070
Take this, just go!

601
01:07:54,044 --> 01:07:56,463
Where did she go?

602
01:08:53,243 --> 01:08:55,161
Song-hwa!

603
01:09:00,252 --> 01:09:02,212
Song-hwa.

604
01:09:11,099 --> 01:09:16,563
Song-hwa! Baby! Let's leave together.

605
01:09:42,555 --> 01:09:43,597
Seol-ran!

606
01:09:49,313 --> 01:09:50,188
No...

607
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:54,318
Come here!

608
01:09:55,446 --> 01:09:57,698
Fucking pervert!

609
01:10:34,244 --> 01:10:35,328
Why?!

610
01:10:35,705 --> 01:10:36,747
Why!

611
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:37,956
Stop!

612
01:11:13,043 --> 01:11:14,878
Hey! Wake up!

613
01:11:14,879 --> 01:11:16,880
Are you okay? Wake up!

614
01:11:30,064 --> 01:11:31,607
Untie me!

615
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:33,401
You're awake?

616
01:11:33,402 --> 01:11:37,406
I'll melt your heart
in front of the chinks.

617
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:51,966
I'll bring back Seol-ran.

618
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:24,506
<i>He's in Silrak Mountain,
I found Seol-ran's sister too.</i>

619
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,841
Also...

620
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,678
the inn owner and her son,

621
01:12:28,888 --> 01:12:32,683
they're all working for Jung.

622
01:12:44,532 --> 01:12:45,157
My money! My money!

623
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:56,213
Only Jesus' blood will
wash away my sins!

624
01:12:56,255 --> 01:12:57,881
Only Jesus' blood!

625
01:13:22,663 --> 01:13:23,914
Begin.

626
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:29,045
Doesn't she look like
she'll get high nicely?

627
01:13:55,246 --> 01:13:57,372
Boss, I left the sample in there!

628
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:05,507
Find Seol-ran first.

629
01:14:14,443 --> 01:14:15,620
<i>Who is he?</i>

630
01:14:15,837 --> 01:14:17,837
It's not important who he is,

631
01:14:17,862 --> 01:14:19,618
but that he should be killed.

632
01:15:29,322 --> 01:15:32,366
She's just a kid, how
could you do that to her?!

633
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:35,578
Your accent is weird,
where are you from?

634
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:40,418
Why the hell is that important?!

635
01:15:40,753 --> 01:15:42,212
I'm from Yanbian, asshole!

636
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,131
Fuck that!

637
01:15:49,889 --> 01:15:51,390
I'm gonna kill you...

638
01:17:14,078 --> 01:17:15,119
Hey!

639
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,830
Seol-ran!

640
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:19,375
Wake up! Snap out of it!

641
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:24,631
Fucking hell...

642
01:18:02,471 --> 01:18:03,305
I'm sick of this.

643
01:19:39,259 --> 01:19:40,051
Tell me.

644
01:19:40,469 --> 01:19:45,057
Did you know Det.
Yoon, whom you killed?

645
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:57,656
Who's the informant
you've been feeding?

646
01:19:57,949 --> 01:20:04,122
Fucker, you know it was Park!

647
01:21:10,373 --> 01:21:11,623
Bastard...

648
01:21:11,624 --> 01:21:15,754
Son of a bitch...

649
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:18,090
Shit...

650
01:21:54,386 --> 01:21:56,513
Seol-ran, Seol-ran!

651
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,685
Wake up!

652
01:22:01,061 --> 01:22:03,188
Wake up! Seol-ran!

653
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,651
Song-hwa...

654
01:22:08,654 --> 01:22:10,697
Where's my sister?

655
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:22,879
Let's go see her, I hid her away.

656
01:23:42,271 --> 01:23:44,731
Song-hwa!

657
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:00,668
Song-hwa!

658
01:24:25,367 --> 01:24:27,910
Don't want to go to Seoul?

659
01:24:28,078 --> 01:24:30,706
I don't want to go yet.

660
01:24:42,930 --> 01:24:43,972
Gook-hyun!

661
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:55,987
Thank you.

662
01:25:33,076 --> 01:25:39,291
<i>To the deceased Det. Kang,
Heuksan was an island of hope.</i>

663
01:25:46,051 --> 01:25:48,762
Where were you?

664
01:25:51,057 --> 01:25:51,724
Eun-jae, what's this?

665
01:25:59,443 --> 01:26:01,361
Who gave this to you?

666
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:08,828
<i>This is Ki-man Kang.</i>

667
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:14,752
<i>Det. Jae-ho Yoon was framed
and died because of my mistake.</i>

668
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:21,970
<i>He was a brave cop who
died saving his colleague.</i>

669
01:26:22,513 --> 01:26:26,559
<i>I'm glad his reputation
can be restored.</i>

670
01:26:26,894 --> 01:26:33,693
<i>With heavy heart, I'd like
to beg for his forgiveness.</i>

671
01:26:44,374 --> 01:26:46,918
Baby, who gave this to you?

672
01:27:01,687 --> 01:27:03,522
<i>Nam!</i>

673
01:27:03,523 --> 01:27:07,443
<i>I heard you won't air
the Heuksan cop story.</i>

674
01:27:07,861 --> 01:27:11,824
<i>Think about it again,
it'll be a big hit.</i>
