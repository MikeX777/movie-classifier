son of a bitch.

172
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:44,085
´´A professional photographer

173
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,880
You know what?
There are in sale.

174
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:51,421
lf you take 10 photos of an ass
you get a Star Wars watch.

175
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,354
That´s the good part.

176
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,120
The bad part is, there is
nothing here worth while, Nico.

177
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:08,020
What do you mean?

178
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,522
How much do you want
for the photos?

179
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:35,427

100 and 100.

180
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,966
-l´ll give you a million dollars.
-A million dollars?

181

lf you kill my wife.

182
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:50,831
One moment, one moment.

183
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,257
Kill Margarita?

184
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,534
No, my other wife, stupid.

185
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:03,098
-You´re crazy. Why?
-Are you interested or not?

186
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,996
How can l be interested?

187
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:08,467
l see. You´re still in love
with Margarita.

188
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,263
Don´t be stupid, that has
nothing to do with it.

189
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,335
-l´m not a murderer.
-No?

190
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:16,367
You´re extorting me

191

problem killing someone.

192
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:26,538
Why don´t you go to hell?
You´re a son of a bitch!

193

call me.

194
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:52,206
Hi, Nicolito,
do you have something for me?

195
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,601
Did you bring money
to pay the rent today?

196
00:16:57,846 --> 00:17:00,369
-Leave it there, by the mirror.
-Okay.

200
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:36,550
Where will he take me?

201
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:44,083
Hi darling, did you bring
something for me?

202
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:45,114
Hi baby.

What are you doing here
at this hour?

204

Why do you ask?

205
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:52,313
Do l have visiting hours now
or what?

206
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:57,585
Come on baby. You´re so angry.
Problems with your wife?

207
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:00,183
How did you guess?

208
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,622
l love you when
you´re so angry.

209
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:08,247
She´s a bitch. l don´t want
to see her again in my life.

210
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:12,157
Calm down, sweetheart.
Just forget it.

211
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,014
Are we going out to dance?

212
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:16,122
No, baby, there´s not
enough money.

213
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,591
Oh, darling.

And that money?

215
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:25,154
Where did you get
this money?

216
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:33,550
Are you mute?
Where did you get this money?

217
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,120
You gave it to me.

218
00:18:39,062 --> 00:18:42,461
That´s shit. l would remember
if l had given it to you.

219
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,862
-You have another guy, right?
-No!

220
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:49,223
No, sure,
how stupid can l be?

for your expenses

222
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,790
and when l´m not here,
you sleep around.

223
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,122
No, Walter, don´t say that.
You know l adore you.

224
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,765
This´s a lot of money,
where did you get it?

225
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,955
My mother gave it to me.

226
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,697
Shit again. Your mother
doesn´t have a cent.

227
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,197
You´re cheating on me
just for money. What a whore!

228
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,959
Walter, don´t talk like that.
You´re scaring me.

229
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:16,427
-Sweetheart.
-No, don´t. Don´t touch me!

230
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,733
Shit!

and what for?

232
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:26,233
[To be cheated on with the first
bastard that comes your way.

233

[Where is your moral,
Rosemary?

234
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,828
[Walter, how can you
believe that, baby.

235
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,863
Sweetheart, you´re my life.
Come here.

236
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,834
Don´t touch me, slut!

[l knew it, l knew it!
l knew l couldn´t trust you.

Very pretty, very young

00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:44,368

l would be wearing horns

240
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,767
and l´ll tell you...

241
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:48,237
[Now what?
You´re playing victim?

242
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,772
[No, go act in La Candelaria.
Come on, get up!

243
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:52,705
Get up, l said, Rosemary.

244

Oh, no!

247

[No, you can´t do this to me!
You can´t die like this!

[Rosemary, no, what is this?
Why do you do this to me?

Rosemary!

252
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,611
No, don´t be a shit with me,
Rosemary.

253
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,545
You see what happens when
you do whatever you want?

254
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,637
Now what am l going to do?

255

Perez, don´t be a nuisance,
okay?

260
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,657
But why did you leave,
being on duty?

261
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:06,092
What if the district attorney
needs you?

262
00:22:06,797 --> 00:22:08,127
What will l tell him?

263
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:10,955

We´ll talk later, Perez.

[Baby, l have to leave you.
What can l do?

Bye, baby.

[Baby, can you imagine
if l had left the gun?

274
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:41,802
Why should l leave
this money here?

All of them, probably.
They´re all stupid.

00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:38,901
You´re so sweet!

342
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:41,567
So sweet, darling.

343
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:45,177
So sweet, darling.

344
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,271
l love you very,
very, very much.

345
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,811
You are a very special
person, very special.

346
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,707
-Okay.
-And your intelligence.

347
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,272
-Your intelligence seduces me.
-Okay.

348
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:08,705
l know what we have to do.

349
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,744
Look, l´ll leave the country
for a while.

350
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,240
l know it´s a difficult moment
for you and you need me.

351
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,610
lt´s also going to be
difficult for me.

352
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,982
But it´s not convenient
for us to be seen together.

353
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:28,145
l´m so proud of you.

354
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:31,043
Very proud.

355
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:40,182
Sorry.

356
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,687
No, brother, what do you
mean he´s a woman?

357
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:57,118
Goofy is not a woman.

358
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:59,348
Goofy is not a woman
and that´s it.

359
00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:01,848
What do you mean
he´s a woman?

360
00:36:05,669 --> 00:36:06,862
-Good morning.
-Hello.

361
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:10,366
ls the gentleman going to stay
over or just for a few hours?

362
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:13,024
-How much is a few hours?
-We are on sale.

363
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:14,567
Pay 3 hours and stay 4.

364
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,535
-The 4 hours, then.
-lt´s 50,000 pesos.

365
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:21,537
Wait a moment.

366
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,271
You said 50,000, right?

367
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:48,439
Fifty.

368
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:53,972
Thanks.

369
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,967
And please don´t
interrupt me, okay?

370
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:58,907
Okay, sir.

371
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:03,872
Bye, thanks.

372
00:37:11,113 --> 00:37:13,671
With that car and the bastard
doesn´t tip?

373
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:15,710
We´ll have to teach him
a lesson.

374
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:52,641
Hi, Montes,
l need your signature.

375
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:54,683
l´m busy.
Can´t you see l´m busy?

376
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:56,911
You can´t just come
and interrupt me.

377
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:58,643
l thought you weren´t busy.

378
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,685
You thought l wasn´t doing
anything, anything at all.

379
00:38:01,855 --> 00:38:02,616
No, but...

380
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:05,118
What? Are you going
to insult me or what?

381
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:08,116
No, calm down, l just want
you to sign these papers.

382
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,819
Just a signature...
You know something, Perez?

383
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:15,550
l´m fed up with you.

384
00:38:19,524 --> 00:38:21,150
And now,
where are you going?

385
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:26,951
Margarita.
Margarita, l´m going to open.

386
00:38:35,427 --> 00:38:37,416
Margarita, are you awake?
Margarita.

387
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:47,594
lt´s always the same thing
with you, goddamn.

388
00:38:48,329 --> 00:38:50,522
Calm down, calm down.

389
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,619
Why is everything so difficult
with you, shit.

390
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,825
Yes, l know.

391
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:02,463
Wait, l didn´t kill her,
she was already dead.

392
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:03,992
She was already dead.

393
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:09,957
Calm down.

394
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:14,261
Just hear me. Calm down,
Pablo hired me to kill you.

395
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,661
But this dead girl
will take your place.

396
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:19,766
That son of a bitch will pay me
and you will be okay.

397
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:22,991
l need your help.
Calm down, calm down.

398
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:24,330
Calm down.

399
00:39:27,502 --> 00:39:28,365
Calm down.

400
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:33,765
l´ll untie you only if you calm
down, only if you calm down.

401
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,766
Will you calm down? Will you
calm down? Yes or no?

402
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:37,732
Untie me!

403
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,968
l´ll do it.

404
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:42,237
Just calm down.

405
00:39:44,538 --> 00:39:47,232
Goddamn, why is everything
so difficult with you?

406
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:51,869
Why would Pablo
want to kill me?

407
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,937
How would l know?
He´s an asshole.

408
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:56,436
You´re a liar!
You kidnapped me for money.

409
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,697
You´re a bastard.

410
00:39:57,874 --> 00:40:00,204
How can you think of
something like that?

411
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:02,706
Margarita, think,
Pablo has a lover.

412
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:04,934
Look, look, look.

413
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:08,939
She probably convinced him
that you´ll keep everything.

414
00:40:09,642 --> 00:40:10,471
Look!

415
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,471
Look!

416
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:17,702
You don´t understand,
do you?

417
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,602
You don´t understand that
l´ll save your life?

418
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:22,142
You don´t realize that.

419
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:30,406
l look like shit! Everything
with you has to be like that.

420
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,070
But, of course, with Pablito

421
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:41,007
everything is fine.

422
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:44,376
Let´s see.

423
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:47,873
-Take off your clothes.
-What?

424
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:50,774
-Hello, Ana.
-Good morning, sir.

425
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,312
-Anything new?
-No, sir, no important calls.

426
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:55,173
But she is waiting for you.

427
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:00,547
-Where is she?
-ln the waiting room, doctor.

428
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:34,952
Yes, l know what
you´re thinking.

429
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:37,714
There are methods
to prove she´s not Margarita.

430
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,947
l also watch CSl

431
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:40,914
But l don´t care.

432
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,716
l need this to last long enough
for Mallarino to pay me.

433
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:48,418
Afterwards, if he finds out she´s
another one, l don´t care.

434
00:41:48,858 --> 00:41:50,324
What can he do? Sue me?

435
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:15,760
Oh, excuse me, l thought
you had already left.

436
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:05,437
-Hello, Emilia. How are you?
-Hello, Pablo. Fine, and you?

437
00:43:06,304 --> 00:43:08,668
Pablo, l am here
representing Margarita.

438
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:10,828
And you brought
divorce documents?

439
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:13,235
Yes.

440
00:43:13,772 --> 00:43:16,603
As you know, Margarita decided
to ask for a divorce

441
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:19,335
due to reasons of which
we are all aware.

442
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,302
So?

443
00:43:20,673 --> 00:43:23,731
She also renounced to all the
properties that were hers.

444
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:26,772
Therefore, Mr. Mallarino,
they´ll be back in your name.

445
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:29,430
The properties in her name
are just a screen.

446
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,334
As a lawyer,
you´d understand.

447
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:35,471
What?

448
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:43,609
My client gave up her rights to
her part of property and money.

449
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:48,571
And also decided not to initiate
legal action against you.

450
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:52,303
Decisions with which,
l must say l totally disagree.

451
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:55,005
So, she´s not going
to demand

452
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:58,305
and does not want a cent of
my money or any of my things.

453
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:01,243
Are we completely
sure of that?

454
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,705
Yes, we´re sure.

455
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:06,143
And why?

456
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:09,143
Because Margarita is
economically independent.

457
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:11,449
She doesn´t need money from
anyone to get ahead in life.

458
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:12,540
She doesn´t need money from
anyone to get ahead in life.

459
00:44:21,217 --> 00:44:21,978
Goddamn!

460
00:45:18,993 --> 00:45:20,618
What the shit is happening?

461
00:45:24,727 --> 00:45:27,989
l have to make an important,
personal phone call.

462
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,122
What?

463
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:32,827
You can´t wait a second
to call your lover?

464
00:45:37,096 --> 00:45:38,686
No, don´t worry,
Mr. Mallarino.

465
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:40,957
And one last thing.

466
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:45,291
lf you need to contact
Margarita, do it through me.

467
00:45:45,664 --> 00:45:48,654
And, as she herself told you,
when you get home tonight

468
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,627
-she will not be there.
-l know!

469
00:45:52,265 --> 00:45:53,992
Okay. Have a good day.

470
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:05,397
[How stupid!

471
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:16,330
Am l stupid or what?

472
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:20,565
Goddamn.

473
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:26,628
-Hello.
-Nicolas, where are you?

474
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:28,532
Wait, l don´t understand.

475
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:30,871

l have no signal.

476
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,664
-Nico!
-Hold on, please.

477
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:34,305

-That´s not what we agreed.

00:49:46,337 --> 00:49:48,133
[-You can´t go in.
-lt´s my room.

514
00:49:48,304 --> 00:49:50,167
[-You can´t go in.
-l already paid.

515
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:52,930
[-l don´t care, you can´t go in.
-You don´t care?

516
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:55,367
[l´d say it in a nice way,
you can´t go in.

517
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:56,800
Where are you going?

518
00:49:57,939 --> 00:50:00,201
Let go of me!
What´s wrong with this guy.

519
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:04,033
Calm down. lf you don´t calm down,
l´ll have to call the cops.

520
00:50:04,207 --> 00:50:06,695
Brother, l´m staying here.
What´s the problem?

521
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:10,137
What do you mean you´re staying
here? You left an hour ago.

522
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,433
l paid 4 hours, l´ve been here 3,
l still have 1 hour left.

523
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:17,872
l´m going to my room. Excuse me.
Let go of me, shit.

524
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:21,700
-Please tell this chimp to stop.
-Don´t insult the kid.

525
00:50:21,877 --> 00:50:24,036
Understand brother,
this is not a hotel.

526
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,574
-Of course, it´s a pigpen.
-lt´s not a hotel.

527
00:50:26,744 --> 00:50:29,040
You came here
with a girl and left.

528
00:50:29,245 --> 00:50:31,404
Pay attention to me,
you left with her.

529
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:34,542
Do you understand?
You came and left with the girl.

530
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:36,837
Once you leave,
you can´t come back in.

531
00:50:37,012 --> 00:50:39,570
Look, there´s someone inside,
someone is inside.

532
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:41,302
l have to go in now, okay?

533
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:44,139
No, you went in with a girl
and left with a girl

534
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,643
there was no one else.

535
00:50:45,814 --> 00:50:48,746
Brother, there´s another girl
inside, l´m going in, bye.

536
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:51,006
-Wait a moment, wait!
-Let go of me!

537
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,440
-What´s wrong with him?
-Hold on.

538
00:50:55,415 --> 00:50:56,676
ls this guy drugged?

539
00:51:04,817 --> 00:51:07,409
You have to tell me
if there´s an extra person.

540
00:51:07,551 --> 00:51:09,107
l´m telling you now, stupid.

541
00:51:09,284 --> 00:51:11,944
There´s another person in
the room. Can l go in?

542
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:15,580
Well, the other person
has an extra charge of 25,000.

543
00:51:17,485 --> 00:51:19,714
So that was the problem, huh?
Money.

544
00:51:19,919 --> 00:51:22,943
-Everything has its price.
-For money, the monkey dances.

545
00:51:23,187 --> 00:51:24,880
Here, buy the monkey
a banana.

546
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:27,217
Ok?

547
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:30,350
Bye.

548
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:33,850
Go ahead. What a bastard.

549
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:58,451
Your husband
doesn´t want you dead now.

550
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,419
What a coincidence.

551
00:52:01,627 --> 00:52:04,457
He doesn´t want me dead now
or he never wanted it?

552
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,894
Now what the hell
am l going to do?

553
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,057
There has to be a way
to make him pay us.

554
00:52:18,529 --> 00:52:19,359
Liutenant

555
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:22,526
-buy them a cup of coffee, thanks.
-Yes, sir. Let´s go.

556
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:39,028
What´s new?

557
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:42,861
Perez!

558
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:50,634
-Hello, Montes.
-What happened?

559
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,700
Supposedly, we have
a car accident.

560
00:52:54,202 --> 00:52:56,861
´´The car´s smashed.
What do you mean ""supposedly"".´´

561
00:52:57,202 --> 00:53:00,794
l think the girl was dead before
the car ran off the road.

562
00:53:01,602 --> 00:53:02,398
Before?

563
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:06,167
-She´s rigid already or what?
-More or less.

564
00:53:07,471 --> 00:53:08,437
What else?

565
00:53:08,803 --> 00:53:10,963
We found a bottle of liquor
in the car.

566
00:53:11,638 --> 00:53:14,104
Her papers and her purse were
in the shrubs.

567
00:53:14,405 --> 00:53:16,268
The car is in her name.

568
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:19,328
So, you believe this is
a sham or what?

569
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,664
lt seems her name is
Margarita Nieto.

570
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:26,299
And guess whose wife she is.

571
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:28,937
No Perez, this is serious
business. Guess...

572
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,136
Guess!

573
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:31,504
Perez!

574
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:33,467
Pablo Mallarino.

575
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:37,307
No, no, wait a moment,
Pablo Mallarino, of the...

576
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:39,964
-the Mallarinos, the Mallarino?
-The same one.

577
00:53:41,175 --> 00:53:44,142
Wow! Then we really
have to work.

578
00:53:44,577 --> 00:53:47,407
Your car did not explode,
Rosemary is almost intact.

579
00:53:47,944 --> 00:53:51,775
The police will immediately
notice that the girl´s not you.

580
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:54,343
[And will tell Mallarino.

581
00:53:56,912 --> 00:53:59,140
What can l do for
the bastard to pay us.

582
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,878
What can we do for
him to pay us.

583
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:04,143
You´re right.

584
00:54:05,713 --> 00:54:09,146
This woman is the wife
of that Mallarino... Pablo.

585
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:13,575
l don´t watch T.V., but l have
seen her in the show biz news

586
00:54:13,748 --> 00:54:15,806
arriving at those parties
they go to.

587
00:54:16,348 --> 00:54:18,144
Well, l´ve never
seen this woman.

588
00:54:18,315 --> 00:54:20,475
That´s not strange,
you never watch T.V.

589
00:54:21,283 --> 00:54:24,182
Think, stupid, think...
What can l do?

590
00:54:25,384 --> 00:54:29,817
lt´s depressing that young
people die like this.

591
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:33,248
Well, that´s life.

592
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:37,351
You have the woman´s l.D.,
right, Perez?

593
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:39,451
-lt´s there.
-There, where?

594
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:42,119
-lt was in her wallet.
-There´s nothing here.

595
00:54:42,486 --> 00:54:44,282
Don´t tell me you lost it,
Perez.

596
00:54:44,686 --> 00:54:46,949
No, impossible, it was here,
in the wallet.

597
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:48,177
What a problem!

598
00:54:48,487 --> 00:54:51,976
Now we´ll have to wait until
the fingerprints are compared.

599
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:54,478
You did take
the fingerprints, right?

600
00:54:54,688 --> 00:54:55,711
Of course l did.

601
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:59,346
Couldn´t the fingerprint expert
have taken the l.D.?

602
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:02,555
No way, l didn´t let anyone
get near until you arrived.

603
00:55:02,722 --> 00:55:03,983
What a problem, Perez.

604
00:55:04,256 --> 00:55:06,848
We could have identified
this woman right away.

605
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:12,320
You two! Look for the
deceased´s l.D. immediately.

606
00:55:12,658 --> 00:55:14,215
Come on! Get to it!

607
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:18,625
And pay close attention,
from now on, l, personally

608
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,382
will take charge of everything
related with this case.

609
00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:24,259
ls that clear?

610
00:55:25,294 --> 00:55:26,260
Wow, Superman.

611
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:30,359
-What did you say, Perez?
-That l think it´s super.

612
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,226
l think it´s super also.

613
00:55:33,194 --> 00:55:37,752
And in legal medicine, only l
will see the forensic report.

614
00:55:39,762 --> 00:55:41,126
Did you finish, doctor?

615
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:43,190
No sir, l still need
some more.

616
00:55:43,362 --> 00:55:45,522
Don´t take any more,
give me the camera.

617
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:47,492
l´ll download
those photographs.

618
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,887
l don´t want them
to also get lost!.

619
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:53,565
What a blunder, Perez,
what a blunder.

620
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:54,997
What a blunder, Perez,
what a blunder.

621
00:55:55,232 --> 00:55:57,095
What we will do
is the following.

622
00:55:57,566 --> 00:56:00,532
We´ll call Mallarino to tell
him that l kidnapped you

623
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:02,991
and that, if he wants
to see you alive

624
00:56:03,233 --> 00:56:05,927
he has to give me
what he offered me to kill you

625
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:07,588
then we keep the money.

626
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,159
What do you think?

627
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:14,163
What do l think?
l´m kidnapped

628
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,597
and stop talking about ´us´,
as if we were in this together

629
00:56:17,769 --> 00:56:21,065
because you´ll pay for killing
that woman and kidnapping me.

630
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:26,266
Margarita, please help me,
don´t leave.

631
00:56:27,037 --> 00:56:29,970
Help you? Ask the models
you fucked for help.

632
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,261
[Pathetic madman!

633
00:56:32,004 --> 00:56:34,698
Margarita, this is not the time

634
00:56:36,738 --> 00:56:37,897
to talk about that.

635
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:51,336
-What are you doing here?
-Can we talk?.

636
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,438
-No.
-Yes.

637
00:56:53,775 --> 00:56:55,206
Pablo, our agreement was

638
00:56:55,408 --> 00:56:57,670
that we would not meet
until it was over.

639
00:56:57,841 --> 00:57:00,307
l have something to tell you,
can l come in?

640
00:57:06,476 --> 00:57:08,272
Margarita doesn´t
want anything.

641
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,671
She doesn´t want money or
properties and will not demand.

642
00:57:11,844 --> 00:57:14,503
-There´s no need to kill her.
-Now you´re stupid.

643
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:15,709
Stupid, why?

644
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:18,703
-l can´t believe what you did.
-What did l do?

645
00:57:19,046 --> 00:57:21,274
Obviously she doesn´t want
anything now

646
00:57:21,446 --> 00:57:24,469
but when we get married,
she´s going to want everything.

647
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,604
What belongs to her by law
and what belongs to me.

648
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:31,277
-She´s not like that.
-She´s not like that.

649
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:33,004
Again, she´s not like that?

650
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:35,473
You don´t seem
to know women.

651
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:37,205
Don´t be so naive.

652
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:40,405
l´ll have her sign a document
renouncing to everything.

653
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,913
lf she asks for money,
l can sue her, okay?

654
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:44,878
Killing her seems drastic
to me.

655
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,182
l didn´t think
you were so stupid.

656
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,338
l have to leave.

657
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,649
Don´t leave, please.
Don´t leave, please.

658
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:56,307
l have to leave.

659
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,683
[Start the car, let´s go.

660
00:58:03,053 --> 00:58:05,883
Don´t leave, driver,
stupid, l´m talking to you.

661
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,086
Shit, l´m begging.

662
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:38,091
Let´s see baby,
help me understand.

663
00:58:38,258 --> 00:58:40,747
Why were you dressed
in that woman´s clothes.

664
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:44,986
l have to find that woman,
before anyone else

665
00:58:45,226 --> 00:58:48,852
because if she says she´s not
the person we found in the car

666
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,625
goddamn, you understand?

667
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:53,460
l´d really be in big trouble.

668
00:58:56,028 --> 00:58:57,221
[Hi, this is Rosemary.

669
00:58:57,528 --> 00:59:00,620
[l´m not at home. Please leave
a message, we´ll talk later.

670
00:59:00,862 --> 00:59:01,623
[Bye.

671
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:05,660
[Hi, Rosemary, is your mother.
Where are you?

672
00:59:05,996 --> 00:59:08,656
[l´m worried. Why weren´t
you there this morning?

673
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,693
[Please, call me when
you get home.

674
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,093
There has to be
a clue somewhere.

675
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,867
She did have a son of a bitch
living here. l was really stupid!

676
00:59:56,605 --> 00:59:57,502
And this?

677
01:00:02,806 --> 01:00:06,170
What´s this?
This is the same woman.

678
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,736
Those two are
working together.

679
01:00:15,307 --> 01:00:19,900
So this was the bastard

Detective, Mr. Pablo Mallarino
is looking for you. Come on in.

764

The face of the person
in the photos

765
01:06:22,201 --> 01:06:26,100

because the impact was... right?

766
01:06:26,302 --> 01:06:29,063
You wouldn´t have recognized
her anyway.

767
01:06:30,536 --> 01:06:34,367
That´s why l covered her with
this blurry rectangle.

768
01:06:36,404 --> 01:06:41,030
Why? Because it would be
terrible, apart from your grief

769
01:06:41,605 --> 01:06:45,231
to have a disfigured image
of her. Do you understand?

770
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:47,137
Yes, it´s okay, it´s okay.

771
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,166
Well, the idea Mr. Mallarino,
is for you

772
01:06:52,707 --> 01:06:55,468
to tell me if, apart from the car,
you can identify

773
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:58,702
some of the objects your wife
had with her.

774
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:03,701
That is, her watch, her clothes,
things like that

775
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:07,268
and physically,
some small details, l don´t know.

776
01:07:07,876 --> 01:07:11,673
Some mark, a mole, the hair.
Yes? Are you ok with that?

777
01:07:17,644 --> 01:07:23,077
Yes, those are the clothes she
was wearing when l said good...

778
01:07:25,046 --> 01:07:27,239
At home, when l left...

779
01:07:28,046 --> 01:07:31,013
when l left this morning,
she had those clothes on.

780
01:07:31,212 --> 01:07:33,701
Her appearance,
there´s no doubt it´s her.

781
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,011
The hair that l saw was...

782
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,145
The watch that we saw before.
Can you go back?.

783
01:07:41,415 --> 01:07:42,210
Yes.

784
01:07:42,948 --> 01:07:45,812
The watch, l gave it to her,
for her birthday.

785
01:07:46,349 --> 01:07:47,872
The necklace is also hers.

786
01:07:56,217 --> 01:07:58,649
Mr. Mallarino, are you ok?.

787
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:02,613
Yes.

788
01:08:07,652 --> 01:08:09,982
We found this purse
near the car.

789
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:13,279
We didn´t find her
identification card.

790
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,350
But there´s a wallet
with other documents.

791
01:08:16,554 --> 01:08:20,009
l would like for you to check
and try to identify these things.

792
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:37,316
Do you recognize
what you see? Do you?

793
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:45,050
Yes, it´s...

794
01:08:46,092 --> 01:08:48,354
They are her things.
lt is Margarita.

795
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,450
lt was Margarita.

796
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,557
Well then.

797
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:03,254
This is a copy of
the forensic report.

798
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:07,184
Since we didn´t find
any identification card

799
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:10,487
we sent the fingerprints we
took, to the Register Office.

800
01:09:10,662 --> 01:09:11,754
But what for?

801
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:16,162
To be compared and matched
with the records of your wife.

802
01:09:16,597 --> 01:09:21,586
However, the Register has too
much work due to the... yes?

803
01:09:22,098 --> 01:09:24,963
And l think it will take quite
a while, let´s say

804
01:09:26,565 --> 01:09:28,895
a year or so, before they
send the results.

805
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,964
However, with your
identification of her belongings

806
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:40,525
l think we are more than
certain that it is your wife.

807
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:46,857
And, Mr. Mallarino,
believe me, l am really sorry.

808
01:09:50,235 --> 01:09:51,701
What does it say there?

809
01:09:53,036 --> 01:09:53,967
Where?

810
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,764
-On that report.
-Oh, yes.

811
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,836
What it says is that

812
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:07,734
several hours before the
accident, your wife was dead.

813
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:16,373
And that they found alcohol
in her throat and esophagus.

814
01:10:17,574 --> 01:10:20,631
We believe it was introduced,
the alcohol

815
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:22,771
after she was dead.

816
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:25,933
Why? Because the body
hadn´t absorbed it.

817
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:28,336
Okay, what does
all this mean?

818
01:10:30,109 --> 01:10:31,200
lt means that

01:10:33,776 --> 01:10:36,038

Yes? Well, that´s not difficult.
Look at me.

1190
01:36:40,335 --> 01:36:41,767
l came to give you this.

1191
01:36:41,935 --> 01:36:44,527
The other envelope was
destroyed by the bullet.

1192
01:36:44,703 --> 01:36:46,862
-Did you see the photos?
-Yes.

1193
01:36:47,569 --> 01:36:49,536
How long have you
been doing this?

1194
01:36:52,003 --> 01:36:53,765
l started after
our separation.

1195
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:55,858
That means that

1196
01:36:56,271 --> 01:36:58,863
you´ve been following me
for a year and a half

1197
01:36:59,038 --> 01:37:00,004
taking photos?

1198
01:37:00,305 --> 01:37:01,770
-Stupid, right?
-Stupid.

1199
01:37:03,072 --> 01:37:03,731
Wait, wait.

1200
01:37:03,906 --> 01:37:07,599
-Did you come to laugh at me?
-Yes, exactly.

1201
01:37:07,772 --> 01:37:10,170
Yes? Very nice.
You like it, don´t you?

1202
01:37:10,673 --> 01:37:11,434
Bye.

1203
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:19,674
Bye, sweetheart.

1204
01:37:32,544 --> 01:37:33,703
l forgot something.

1205
01:37:34,777 --> 01:37:35,572
Yes?

1206
01:37:40,611 --> 01:37:42,100
Are you going to behave?

1207
01:37:43,312 --> 01:37:45,335
Yes, yes, l´m going to behave.

1208
01:37:45,546 --> 01:37:46,375
You´d better.

1209
01:37:48,913 --> 01:37:50,708
Give me a call
when you get out.

1210
01:37:51,347 --> 01:37:52,472
To take you home.

1211
01:37:55,947 --> 01:37:58,812
[Do you want to know what
happened to the rest? Okay.

1212
01:37:59,214 --> 01:38:01,942
As you can imagine, nothing
happened to Mallarino.

1213
01:38:02,681 --> 01:38:05,671
There was no investigation.
Nothing at all.

1214
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:10,181
[He paid Walter to accept full
responsibility and keep quiet.

1215
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,315
[His sentence wasn´t long.

1216
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:13,647
[l didn´t die.

1217
01:38:14,017 --> 01:38:15,506
[Rosemary was an accident.

1218
01:38:16,317 --> 01:38:18,079
[There wasn´t much
against him.

1219
01:38:18,584 --> 01:38:21,846
[Perez got the best part, he was
promoted to Chief Detective

1220
01:38:22,085 --> 01:38:24,211
[and was given
Walter´s office.

1221
01:38:25,452 --> 01:38:26,384
[Now, Margarita

1222
01:38:26,986 --> 01:38:30,044
[asked Mallarino for much more
than half of his fortune

1223
01:38:30,353 --> 01:38:33,752
[as retribution for not accusing
him and for leaving him alone.

1224
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,149
Take it easy Pablo, this is a
piece of cake. Asshole.

1225
01:38:38,388 --> 01:38:40,616
´´[Mallarino´s lover,
""actress/model""´´

1226
01:38:40,788 --> 01:38:42,049
[never went to Madrid.

1227
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:46,883
[But, when she realized Margarita
was alive and Mallarino was poor

1228
01:38:47,823 --> 01:38:52,017
[she accepted the offer and
went to Per£ to work.

1229
01:38:52,357 --> 01:38:55,482
You know, if l place my hand
like this, it´s super organic.

1230
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,090
[And that´s all.
The end.

1231
01:39:30,363 --> 01:39:32,829
Sarah, you did it wrong again.

1232
01:39:33,063 --> 01:39:34,461
Everyone ready!

1233
01:39:35,063 --> 01:39:39,588
Chapter 2536, scene 25,
take 18, shooting right now.

1234
01:39:39,764 --> 01:39:41,196
Five, four, three...

1235
01:39:44,665 --> 01:39:45,563
Carlos Lopera

1236
01:39:47,599 --> 01:39:49,360
our relationship
is impossible.

1237
01:39:50,433 --> 01:39:51,262
But, Natalia

1238
01:39:52,266 --> 01:39:53,596
l love you.

1239
01:39:57,167 --> 01:39:57,996
l know

1240
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:00,562
but...

1241
01:40:03,035 --> 01:40:05,831
l am, l am your real
twin sister.
