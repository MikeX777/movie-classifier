1
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
I am sure that our weapons
is of the best quality.

2
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
And the SM corporation
has the highest competence.

3
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,700
Especially in the production of laser weapons.

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,700
True, our company always fulfills the
of the contract.

5
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,000
It always delivers equipment on time.

6
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,400
And we guarantee the military as well as important officers a
a very attractive offer.

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,700
I think they offer you ladies an excellent product.

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,700
General Kane.

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,100
This anti-tank weapon, which the SM corporation
offered us last year.

10
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,700
Well, I think it was not so bad.

11
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Let's order 10,000 pieces.
By.

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,100
So my ladies.
We are finalizing.

13
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Let's not kid ourselves, I'm terrified.

14
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,600
Change is not easy. But I am proud,
That I had the courage to do it.

15
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Are you writing a book?

16
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,900
This may sound idealistic....

17
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,400
But especially in a politics and government steeped in
cynicism in politics and government.

18
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,900
This is where I hope to do something
valuable for my country.

19
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,600
To contribute something from yourself.

20
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,600
And be proud of it.

21
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,600
That's great to hear.

22
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,600
People still only criticize.
What happened to this country?

23
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,300
They are ashamed of the greatness,
that we have achieved.

24
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,900
Are you writing an article for a newspaper?

25
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,600
- No, this is just my diary.

26
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,300
- A diary?
- Easier than writing in a diary.

27
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,300
Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

28
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,300
My name is Bill Slater.
- Melinda Griffin.

29
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,300
Where are you from?

30
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,500
- From a small town in Ohio.
You've never heard of him.

31
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,300
From where.

32
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,500
- Ashtabula
- No kidding.

33
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,600
You probably won't believe it, but my first girlfriend,
first love.

34
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,000
She came from Ashtabula.

35
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,600
Unbelievable.

36
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Unbelievable.

37
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,000
I fell in love with her.
She was the girl of my dreams.

38
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Then suddenly she disappeared.
With my things.

39
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,000
- It's sad.
- I missed them.

40
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
She was not as pretty as you.

41
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,700
- Pardon?

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,300
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

43
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,800
Melinda.

44
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,500
What are you doing here?
- Forgive me, I am so ashamed.

45
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
- Don't be ridiculous,
What are you doing in Washington?

46
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,800
Well, I decided to take you up on your offer.

47
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,800
- That's great.
What kind of offer?

48
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,100
- Do you remember when we talked on the phone,
about a year ago?

49
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
You said it was like being in Washington,

50
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,700
then I would live with you.
- A year ago?

51
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
I don't remember.

52
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,400
- Didn't you get a letter?
I wrote that I was coming.

53
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
- I never got it.

54
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
- Didn't you get it?

55
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Would you be so kind?

56
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,200
This is Mark Drysdale, a friend of mine.

57
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,500
Or rather, a partner.

58
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Mark, meet Melinda Griffin,
my best friend from home.

59
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,200
Hello, very nice to meet you, Melinda.

60
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,600
I am really very sorry,
That I have disturbed you.

61
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,300
- But you didn't interfere at all,
I only came here for...

62
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,900
I have to go now.

63
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,900
Have you checked with these papers?

64
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,100
"International Singles Rally.

65
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,300
"Computer Dating with Captain Hill."

66
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,100
"Performances at the Millionaires' Club."

67
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,100
Did you take advantage of everything?

68
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,900
- No, just from a date with Captain Hill.

69
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
See what I found.

70
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,600
Sorry, can't believe I missed it

71
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm really happy to see you.
- Me too.

72
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,500
Gosh, you look great,
- Thank you.

73
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
You also look good.

74
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,800
I put something on.

75
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,800
Then how long did you come for?

76
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,000
- Forever.
- As much as that?

77
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,500
It's too long, my roommate will be angry.

78
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
- I'm not talking about your apartment, Debbie.
But about Washington.

79
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,900
I left Ohio for good.

80
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Melinda.

81
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,800
Look what happened to me.

82
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Cheryl!

83
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,600
This is my friend from home,
Melinda Griffin.

84
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,900
It's nice to meet you Melinda.
- Nice to meet you too, Cheryl.

85
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,600
Don't be surprised, this is normal with her.

86
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,800
But he's a great guy,
He has everything I've always dreamed of.

87
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,300
He is rich, strong, sensitive,
caring and rich.

88
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,300
You got to know each other two days ago.
- But for that, in-depth.

89
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,600
Lester Chadsworth III.

90
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,400
He teaches me accounting.

91
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,600
- Accounting?

92
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,300
- He likes my potential.
- That's nice.

93
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Cheryl, do you mind,
to have Melinda stay with us, for a while?

94
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,600
- But no.
If you don't mind the couch.

95
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,400
I don't want to cause trouble.
I'll find some housing.

96
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,900
- Are you kidding, do you know what prices are
in this city?

97
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
You will stay with us.
- Yes.

98
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,300
Thanks. And as soon as I get some work,
I'll contribute to the rent.

99
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,100
Do you type?
- Yes, 80 words per minute.

100
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,300
Maybe we can get you a job.
We both work at the Pentagon.

101
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,400
- Pentagon?
I would love to work there.

102
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,700
This is the most stimulating work
in Washington.

103
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,200
- Stimulating?
We are just secretaries.

104
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,100
- No matter what, you are working for the country.

105
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,700
Right.

106
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,800
They are doing it again.

107
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
What do they do?

108
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,200
Mark believes this makes you burn calories.

109
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,600
Well, let's celebrate.
Here's to Melinda's new life in Washington.

110
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,400
I'll drink to that and the three P's.
- What three P's.

111
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,100
Kisses, caresses, fucking.
And for having fun.

112
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,300
As much fun as possible.
- Here's to having fun.

113
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
And for a better government.

114
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,400
Sorry.

115
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,800
The top?
- No, the bottom.

116
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,800
Thank God.

117
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
Hi Melinda, I talked to my boss,
He will definitely find you a job.

118
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,000
Really? That's wonderful,
I don't know how to thank you.

119
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,100
- Don't thank me just him.
Come on.

120
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm not going to work here?

121
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Hi Mark, remember Melinda?

122
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
I did not recognize the gentleman without the cap.

123
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,200
Sit down please.

124
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Lieutenant Cranston, this is Captain Drysdale.
- How are you doing, Mark?

125
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,500
There's the young lady I told you about at my place.
Melinda.

126
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,200
So maybe I'll send it to you.
- What does it look like?

127
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,900
We're talking through a microphone, jerk.

128
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,600
His office is the third door away.
Lt. Cranston.

129
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,500
Thank you captain.
- Pleasure on my side.

130
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,200
I show her the city,
So we won't meet today.

131
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,900
I can't meet either.
- Really?

132
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,900
Why?
- What difference does it make, you can't anyway.

133
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,900
- Where are you going?
- And I ask you?

134
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,900
- After all, I told you.
So you don't need to ask.

135
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,900
- No matter what.
- I'm going to miss it.

136
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I studied political science,
so I have the required knowledge.

137
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Let's get something straight, Melinda.

138
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,900
This is the Public Information section.

139
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,600
Our main function is
Preparing information worthy of publication.

140
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,400
Showing the army in a positive light.

141
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
And passing them on to the media.

142
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,500
This sounds equally fascinating.

143
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,500
Let me show you something fascinating.

144
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,200
In short, it is not hard work.
Quite relaxing.

145
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,000
If you know what I mean.

146
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,600
It's all about the best possible stories,
That can be shared with the media, right?

147
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,300
Let me take care of it, okay?
- Sure.

148
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,900
Can I ask you a personal question?
- Of course.

149
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,500
Are you married?

150
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,300
- Don't.

151
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,000
Mistake.

152
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,900
So Melinda doesn't mind
Working on weekends?

153
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Not all of them, of course.
Only when necessary.

154
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,600
- No, it can be.

155
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,900
Is the boyfriend okay with it?
- I don't have a boyfriend.

156
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,600
Such an attractive woman doesn't have a boyfriend?

157
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,100
You must be feeling lonely.
- Do you have any more questions, Lieutenant?

158
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,900
Let me ask you Melinda,
what do you think about the population in India?

159
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,600
- What's wrong with her?

160
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,600
They have overpopulation, so they could probably use a
birth control program.

161
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,400
And they have one. They have clinics,
where they teach birth control methods.

162
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,700
And where they hand out contraceptives.

163
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm glad you support birth control.

164
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,600
What methods do you use?
- I don't think it's related...

165
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,000
- It's nothing personal,
Just government procedures.

166
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,300
If you don't want to answer...

167
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,600
Well, I guess that's it.
- So what should I do now?

168
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,600
Go home and wait for a call?
- Don't.

169
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,000
Take these press releases,
and get to work.

170
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,900
You mean I got the job?
- That's right.

171
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,400
15 thousand a year,
medical care and raises.

172
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,700
That's great, thank you.
Good luck Melinda.

173
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,700
We will definitely fit together.

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,400
Thank you.

175
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,900
You guys are finally done screwing around,
While I'm talking...

176
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Lieutenant Cranston?
What the hell are you talking about?

177
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,100
General Kane... it was just...
such a joke.

178
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,100
No sir, this will not happen again.

179
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
- That's a good thing.

180
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,400
Thank you very much.

181
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,400
One margherita. For me, too.
And for me.

182
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,800
At my expense.

183
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Next on mine.

184
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm Sidney, this is Michael,
and that one is Steve.

185
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,800
I'm Debbie, this is Cheryl
and Melinda.

186
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,800
Pleasure.

187
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,500
It's hard to talk through the noise.
It doesn't hurt to go out anyway.

188
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,300
I haven't seen you here before.
- We go out a lot.

189
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,800
But mostly to very expensive
restaurants.

190
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,300
Melinda is here for the first time.
She has just arrived.

191
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,100
- Where from.
- From a small town in Ohio.

192
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,700
In the south they go to bed early.
- And what do you do for a living?

193
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,800
We work at the Pentagon.
- That means we should know you.

194
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,900
And what do you guys do?
- We are lawyers.

195
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,700
"Casey Hubbell & Smith.

196
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,100
Which ones are you?
- None, they are the owners, they are dead.

197
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,500
Where are you from?

198
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,500
Attention, someone here is targeting a permanent relationship.
- We accepted.

199
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,100
Remember he needs motivation.

200
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,800
I thought we had two bachelors,
But there are three.

201
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,200
Yes Melinda, tell them.

202
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,800
Yes, for the three P's. Kisses, caresses, and....
- Fun.

203
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,400
Oh Sidney, I don't want to live without you anymore.

204
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,800
Tell me more about your mother.
- I'll be right back.

205
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,600
- Wait, where are you going?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

206
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,900
- Will I see you again?
- You will see me when I return.

207
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,400
I would like you to handle my case.

208
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,900
A week ago I tripped on a slippery floor.

209
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,500
My case is quite like this one.

210
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,000
Mason vs. Janowicz. I researched it.

211
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,800
What is with you?
- Nothing, and what should be?

212
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,900
- What do you think was going to happen
After arriving here?

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,900
- I thought we would sit down, talk,
and get to know each other better.

214
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,900
After all, we are talking.

215
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,200
But I think we could get to know each other
even better.

216
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,500
Like our friends.
- I don't like it that way.

217
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,900
I don't go to bed with someone
whom I hardly know.

218
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,300
- Don't you know?
I told you the story of my life.

219
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,100
My parents' divorce.
How I had surgery as a child.

220
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,600
About my brother's alcoholism.

221
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,200
How my dog died.
How I walked 5 miles to school.

222
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,900
Through the snow.
And you say you don't know me?

223
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,700
- Michael, it's nothing personal.
I just ...

224
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,600
I don't believe in casual sex.

225
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,300
Why do you think God put us on earth
as male and female?

226
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,700
This is what we are supposed to do.
That was God's plan.

227
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,300
- But not mine,
I want to do something else.

228
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,400
You are so beautiful, I'm serious.
Someone already told you that?

229
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,300
See how tense your neck is.

230
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,000
Let yourself get a massage.

231
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,700
My neck is fine, Michael.

232
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,000
I can read from your hand,
take a look at this line.

233
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,600
Te jes unusual...
- You squish my hand.

234
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,300
Are you injured?
We'll remedy that right away.

235
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,600
Don't you ever give up?
I'm surprised you live alone.

236
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,700
Just trust me.

237
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,000
I will do anything for you.

238
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,000
Hello, I need to fix my typewriter.
It is not working.

239
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,600
Two weeks?

240
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,700
This is ridiculous, I work
In Public Information.

241
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,300
Yes.

242
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,700
Official notification of the defect?
In three exemlpages?

243
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Yes, I understand.

244
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,000
Sorry, Lieutenant, but I reported
typewriter repair.

245
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,400
Can I do something in the meantime?

246
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,700
Whatever you feel like.

247
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,300
Hi Melinda.

248
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,100
I'm going out, all right?
- Yes, I just wanted to arrange the file.

249
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,300
- You can take a break.

250
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,600
- Am I taking a break? I thought it was important.

251
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,100
- What's important, Melinda, is reciprocal relationships.

252
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,400
Sit in my chair.

253
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,400
For everything to work smoothly,
we need to be one team.

254
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,300
One for all
And all for one.

255
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,000
This is the most important principle, do you agree?
- I agree.

256
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,700
We are the American team of the
Department of Defense.

257
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
We are like the "Devil's Cowboys."

258
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,100
I'm the quarterback, and you....
you're on defense.

259
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,400
We need to get to know each other.

260
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,400
To be able to adjust and synchronize the work of the
of the two bodies.

261
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,400
To make it work as one. Do you understand?
- Yes.

262
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,100
Right.

263
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,100
You have to receive the signals that are sent.
- You are the boss.

264
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,800
When I throw the ball, you catch it.
- Yes.

265
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,100
And if I catch,
I'll catch it hard.

266
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,200
Like in soccer, you know?
- I never played, but checking the records....

267
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,100
Leave the files.

268
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,900
I'm talking about playing, I'm talking about catching.

269
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,100
Catching balls

270
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Send signal. 1, 2, 3.

271
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,500
How about a Chinese evening?

272
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,800
How about you Melinda?
- It could be.

273
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,100
Can I ask you guys something?
- Sure.

274
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,500
Does everyone here work like that?
- You mean?

275
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,500
My work actually consists
of doing nothing.

276
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,200
I arranged the file and sent the materials
to Roldex.

277
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,600
But I mainly spend my time defending myself
from a sex maniac.

278
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,200
- And what did you expect?
- Probably something else.

279
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,700
- Relax Melinda, you don't work for the government.

280
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
- I don't think anyone works for him.

281
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
What's going on?

282
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,400
Disappeared. All information on the
Russian defense system,

283
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,400
simply disappeared.

284
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
- All of them?
- The ones from computers.

285
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
About the number of their submarines
in the atlantic.

286
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,900
Military deployment in Eastern Europe.
I'm sick of it.

287
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,700
I'm telling you, it's the work of a spy.

288
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,300
Smart and well-trained.

289
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
- Double clever.

290
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,700
Someone as unscrupulous as you,
should not use such words.

291
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,000
Now listen, it's top secret.

292
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,700
There must be no leaks.
- Absolute confidentiality.

293
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,400
- This is good, I like it.
Absolute confidentiality.

294
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,600
I heard that someone last night
cleared out the computer archives.

295
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,600
- You are joking.
- I'm not kidding.

296
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,100
It has dusted off all information
on Russian defense.

297
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,400
- Who could have done it?
- A wily treacherous mole.

298
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Hey, how's it going?

299
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,400
When I saw that it didn't work,
I remembered...

300
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,700
That I had the same.

301
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,700
Thanks a lot.

302
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Do you know what happened in the computer archive?
- No, what?

303
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,500
Some spy broke in,
and deleted all the information,

304
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,100
About Russian defense.

305
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,100
- It's scary.

306
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Absolute confidentiality.

307
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
If the machine was messing up,
call me.

308
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,700
Hey Melinda!
- Debbie, I've already heard the terrible news.

309
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,700
Some Russian spy broke into the
into a computer archive,

310
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,100
And deleted the data.

311
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,700
- I know, the manicurist told me about it.

312
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
Don't worry,
we have no control over it.

313
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,700
For that, I just met the sweetest guy.

314
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
- What.
- He was waiting in my office for Drysdel.

315
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,700
He is a major, having just returned
from West Germany.

316
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,400
He conducted exercises at the Frankfurt base.

317
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,900
He has been married for eight years and has two children.

318
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,900
But he wants to leave his wife,
He is not happy with her.

319
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,200
She is frigid, hasn't had an orgasm in years
and it's driving him crazy.

320
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,200
She is also a terrible hostess.

321
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,000
And every time she comes home
she has curlers in her hair.

322
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,000
He's tall and we have similar intimations.

323
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,500
We both enjoy swimming
And going for long walks....

324
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,500
You learned so much,
While he was waiting in your office?

325
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,500
- Drysdale was about five minutes late.

326
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Debbie, sometimes it's hard to believe.

327
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Great, I'll be right there.

328
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,700
We will talk later at the gym.

329
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,200
If you haven't run away with it by now.

330
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,800
This is very important.

331
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,800
It will go to staff, major news and the Pentagon.

332
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
"Dear Colonel Rogers.

333
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,300
Army swimming championship.

334
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,300
They cannot be held at Camp Drummond this year.

335
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,300
Because they don't have a pool there.

336
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,500
As a result, the army decided,

337
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
That the championship will be held in Fort Culver.
Where they have a swimming pool."

338
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,800
Lieutenant, I can't concentrate,
when you do that.

339
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,400
Focus on the team, Melinda.

340
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,200
Should I read it to you?
- You don't.

341
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,500
The most important thing is the division of roles,
so that everyone does their own thing.

342
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,500
This will allow us to increase the chances.
And achieve success.

343
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Under this garment you must hide
a magnificent body.

344
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,900
Soft and firm to the touch.

345
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,600
Lieutenant Cranston.

346
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,900
You hired me as a secretary.

347
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,500
My responsibilities include,
typing,

348
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,100
Taking care of files, answering phones,

349
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,900
And the rest of routine office work.

350
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,500
On the other hand, kissing and groping me,
do not fall into this category.

351
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,600
When you are ready to finish this letter,
I'll be outside.

352
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,500
I heard that Paul is
very angry.

353
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,500
- Is he mad at me?
I'm the one who's mad at him.

354
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,300
You have to be careful what you do.

355
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,500
Such a job is very difficult to get,
and very easy to lose.

356
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,800
- Do you know what he did?

357
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,300
While dictating the letter
He grabbed me by the breast.

358
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,500
- He could catch me whenever he wants,
He's such a cool teddy bear.

359
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,900
- Cheryl, this is my job,
I can't work like this.

360
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,000
He is my boss, not my boyfriend.

361
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,600
I have not encountered anything like this anywhere.

362
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,300
Melinda, we are not "nowhere".

363
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,000
Only in the US capital.

364
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
You won't need it.

365
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,700
You have certain responsibilities here,
that you don't seem to understand.

366
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,600
And I don't mean coffee brewing.

367
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,300
- Is there anything else I can do for you?

368
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,300
- Yes, get undressed, and do it now.

369
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
- What?

370
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,700
Attention!

371
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,300
Lt. Cranston prefers that you do not come
next week.

372
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,600
So at the end of the week
you can collect your paycheck.

373
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,600
Ms. Perkins, I would like to clarify.
- This will not be necessary.

374
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,400
- It's not my fault.
- It never is, is it?

375
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,700
That would be all.

376
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,400
I will take the key to the bathroom, if you can.

377
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,400
- I'll bring.

378
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,400
Is that what you've been doing all morning?

379
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,300
- No, this is my costume for the weekend party.

380
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,100
See this?

381
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
- What are you talking about?

382
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,000
Masked Ball at "Cassie Hubbel & Smith"

383
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,500
- They are dead.
- I know.

384
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Lawyers whom we sptk arranged them.

385
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Michael has already forgiven you for your broken head.

386
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,400
- As nice as it is, he better
not cancel the ambulance.

387
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,400
What's wrong with her?
- Today she was fired.

388
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,600
What, you didn't want to pretend to be a prisoner of war?
- A prisoner of war?

389
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,400
- He plays along with all the secretaries.

390
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,800
This is the only way you can satisfy the lieutenant.

391
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,800
In any case, you must come to the party,
Friday night.

392
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,800
I have to change my clothes.

393
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,800
I think I just figured out,
How you can get your job back.

394
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,100
Bounce the ball.
- How.

395
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,000
- File a lawsuit with a firm of dead lawyers
For sexual harassment?

396
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,700
- Give it a rest.

397
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,700
One thing Cranston doesn't like,
is when a girl accosts him.

398
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,500
He always has to be Mr. tough guy.
He's nuts about it.

399
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,500
Start molesting him,
and he'll get as soft as a teddy bear.

400
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,800
Turn it into a puppy

401
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,000
- I can't do it, Debbie.
It's not my style.

402
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,800
- That's fine, do as you please,
But you are unemployed.

403
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,200
Think about it.

404
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,800
- How do you know he doesn't like it?

405
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,500
- Trust me, I know.

406
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,200
I can't say that.
And I won't be able to even in a million years.

407
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,400
That's not me.
- Just pretend to be someone else.

408
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Like Mata Hari, or Mae West.

409
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,400
- I can't do it.
- You can.

410
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,800
- I can't.
- You have to. Do you want to get your job back?

411
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,400
- Yes.
- Do you want to work at the Pentagon serving the country?

412
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,200
- Yes.

413
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,500
- Do you want to teach Cranston a lesson,
And overcome your own fears?

414
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,400
- Yes.
- So you can do that.

415
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
- I can do it.

416
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,900
Show him.

417
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,500
Am I talking to Lieutenant Cranston?
- That's right.

418
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,900
- I have an obscene call for you.
Do you agree to pay for the call?

419
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,900
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No, it's not a joke.

420
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
- Very indecent, or just a little?

421
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,600
- Wonderfully indecent.

422
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,200
- I agree.

423
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,200
I would like to... slowly undress you.

424
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:34,500
And I would like to wander with my tongue.

425
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,300
All over your body.

426
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,600
On your shoulders,
your chest.

427
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,300
I would lick my way lower
along your belly.

428
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,300
And finally just then
I would take it in my mouth.

429
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,900
And I would go further

430
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
But don't worry, I'm licking on.

431
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,300
In the stifle of your leg.

432
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,100
And then the other.

433
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And then you explode.

434
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,600
And I'll take into my mouth everything....
What you give me.

435
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,600
Is that all you're going to tell me?

436
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,700
Who is talking?

437
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,300
- Melinda, your former secretary.

438
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,700
Please be at the office tomorrow,
at nine o'clock.

439
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,700
- I'm looking forward to it.

440
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,300
That's until tomorrow, boy

441
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,600
Dear Diary, I will say goodbye for now.

442
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,300
It was nice to record all this
over the years.

443
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,300
But I have a feeling,
I'm going to be very busy right now.

444
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,600
Washington is now in a
A terrible mess.

445
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,400
So starting tomorrow I'm going to start
to do some cleanup here.

446
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Melinda?

447
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,800
In the flesh.
Sexy enough, lieutenant?

448
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,400
- So very sexy.

449
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,300
- Right.

450
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,800
I like guys who are as hard as a rock.

451
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,800
What's the matter?
Don't you like how I kiss?

452
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,900
Is that all you're going to say?

453
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,300
I thought I was attractive to you.

454
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,000
- You don't play fair.
- Did I do something wrong?

455
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm the quarterback, remember?

456
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,800
I send signals.
- Bottom line.

457
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,500
So start playing out.
Send the signal.

458
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,200
I'm waiting for the ball to be passed.

459
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,200
You don't understand anything,
I can't play like that.

460
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,700
I'm the one who sends the signals,
And we play by my rules.

461
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,200
Sit down.
- What?

462
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,200
I said, sit down.
That's an order, Lieutenant.

463
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,500
Here you have correspondence from...

464
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,800
1968, it's shameful.

465
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,900
Let's do some work.

466
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,500
- Right

467
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,900
Completed.

468
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,600
Quite.

469
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,600
- Still last year's correspondence.

470
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,800
Now we will play my game.
My favorite.

471
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,300
A prisoner of war.
- And yes, a prisoner of war.

472
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,600
- That's right, you'll like it.
- Really?

473
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
- Yes, you have just been captured
Middle Eastern guerrillas.

474
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
- Yes?
- Exactly.

475
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,500
Interpol has prepared a rescue operation.

476
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,600
I stand at the head of it.
I will save you.

477
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,300
- It's okay, boy.
You'll have to do your best.

478
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,300
Count to 50.

479
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,300
One Mississippi, two Mississippi....

480
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,400
Breaker 10-4, this is Pixie.
Come on Melinda, are you there?

481
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,700
- Yes, Lieutenant, you have to help me.

482
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,000
They did terrible things to me.

483
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
They want to hound me.
- Don't let them.

484
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,000
Help me!

485
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,300
Hurry up lieutenant,
Before it's too late.

486
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,500
- I'm on my way, Melinda.
Help is on the way.

487
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,100
I'll rescue you, where are you?

488
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,400
- They are already doing it to me. Not so hard!

489
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,100
I can't take it anymore.
Faster Lieutenant.

490
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,400
They torture me.
- No, don't let them.

491
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,700
Where are you?

492
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,400
- I'm at the bottom.
Bottom Line.

493
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,400
Did you understand?

494
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,800
Yes, I want it, yes.
- No!

495
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
I'm going to kill everyone!

496
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,500
I think someone shouted
On the third floor.

497
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,800
You'd better check it out.
- I will.

498
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
My God. Succinct.

499
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,700
Code red.

500
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,500
They detected us!

501
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,500
Smash them.

502
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
That's right, sons of bitches.

503
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,100
Whoever you are,
come out with your paws up.

504
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,100
- Let my secretary out first.

505
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
You are supposed to fire her.

506
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,400
We have another one, bring on the straitjacket.

507
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,200
Drop your weapons and hand over my secretary.

508
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,100
- You throw yours then we will too.

509
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,100
- I do not negotiate with terrorists.

510
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,200
It's my game, so you throw first.

511
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
- Then maybe we'll drop our guns at the same time.

512
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,900
I'll count to three and we'll put it away.
Ready?

513
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,500
- Do you promise?
- We promise.

514
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,300


516
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,600
I will get you.

517
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,600
No please, let me go.

518
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,600
I'm not a crazy person.
- We know. Do you work for us?

519
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,600
Yes, in the information section.

520
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,900
Melinda, I will save you!
Don't say anything to them!

521
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,900
Too many bullets here.

522
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,300
In the corner.

523
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Excuse me.
- Melinda?

524
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,300
- Do we know each other?
- It's me, Michael.

525
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,300
I told you the story of my life.

526
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,000
- Yes. I'm sorry for the blow.
Sorry, I have to find Debbie.

527
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,000
- Wait, maybe we'll have dinner.
Would you like to hear more about my life?

528
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,000
Debbie, I did it, ripped into his game.
- Then what are you doing here?

529
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,300
- I decided to drop in.
- I like your costume.

530
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,100
Who was it?
- It was Major Magnus, head of military intelligence.

531
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,700
- This major? That's it for now.

532
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,800
Sorry, I want you.

533
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,400
I think you are the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

534
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,400
- Thank you.
- My name is Abdul Undine

535
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,000
- Pleasure.
- I am a direct male

536
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,600
I would be honored if you
accompany me after the party.

537
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,000
- I am a direct woman.
Forget.

538
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,000
- I can solicit you much more.
- Really?

539
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,000
- I can give you money, diamonds,
yachts, carpets, everything.

540
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,400
Let's do it darling.
- Right.

541
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,400
But in the pool.

542
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,100
Sorry.

543
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,400
I think you are the most beautiful woman,
I have ever seen.

544
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,400
My entire staff is working on it.

545
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,000
They comb through the files,
they check every shred of backup,

546
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,500
On Russian defense.

547
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,300
How long will it take to put this together?

548
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,700
- Not so long.
- That is, how long?

549
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,000
- About three years.
- Three years?

550
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,800
It is necessary to sort it all out.

551
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,800
- What will we do with Russia during this time?
- We are working on it.

552
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,800
Okay, how long will it take you?
- A few years.

553
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,300
- What about our spy satellites?

554
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,300
- The problem is that we can't
reprogram them.

555
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,800
But we are working on a plan.

556
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,100
We will send out new satellites
and we'll get everything we want.

557
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,700
- Okay, how long will it take?

558
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,800
- Several years before they get everything ready.

559
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,900
It's a disaster.
- I know that.

560
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,500
There must be something we can do now.

561
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,800
I will probably never sleep again.
- Neither will I.

562
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,500
Now I regret that I am responsible for being

563
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,400
a responsible patriot.

564
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,900
Twice you said "responsible."

565
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,100
- Of course, with someone as responsible as me,

566
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,400
this word should be used twice....

567
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,200
Major.
- Yes?

568
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
- I have confidential materials for you.

569
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,800
- Really?

570
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,900
- How did you know?

571
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
Major Magnus' office.

572
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,500
Melinda, the new secretary, said.

573
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,900
The major is just busy.

574
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,900
I will definitely be able to help.
I have access to secret data.

575
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,100
Sorry agent Bluedevil,
this code is inactive.

576
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,600
Please check the access code
of the new package.

577
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,900
Yes, I will inform the major.

578
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,600
Sir, the press corps is here.
Can they come in?

579
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,900
- Oh, yes.

580
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,200
I'll be right there.

581
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,300
Please click here.

582
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,300
Who goes.
- The press corps, sir.

583
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,200
They had an appointment at 10;00.

584
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,200
O 10;00.

585
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,300
So I will accept them.

586
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,800
Major Magnus, is it true,
That the pentagon

587
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:20,300
lost secret data on Russia?

588
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,900
Secret data? But why?

589
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,300
We have the right to know everything,
that goes on behind that desk.

590
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,300
- Nothing happens behind that desk.

591
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,000
You are very tense,
Is something bothering you?

592
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,600
- No, no, everything is fine.

593
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,600
Recently, the military has dragged
the country into a major affair.

594
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,200
You are not in good shape major.

595
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,600
It seems that officers spend too much time
spend behind a desk.

596
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,600
- But I like my desk.

597
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,300
We wanted to find out what happened
With the pentagon's computer archive?

598
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,200
- Rubbish.

599
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,000
- How do we communicate this to the
American public?

600
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,300
I apologize to you, but Mr. Major
is indisposed today.

601
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,600
He seems to react strongly to something....

602
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,500
What he could eat.

603
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,700
Tomorrow afternoon he will certainly answer
all your questions.

604
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,300
Now please forgive me.

605
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,300
Please do not get up, we will hit the exit.

606
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,000
I am linking to Melinda Griffin's office.

607
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,000
Melinda wants them to be rigged.

608
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,300
Melinda asks for data from the computer.

609
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,400
These are reports for Melinda.

610
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:58,000
If you think you can change
the prevailing work rules here, young lady.

611
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,000
That's not going to happen.

612
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,700
- Ms. Perkins.

613
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,000
If someone here distributes functions.
Or is hiring.

614
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,400
This is me.
- I know.

615
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,400
The chain of command applies here.

616
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,700
And I will not let it be broken.

617
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,700
Colonel Brian's office.

618
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,200
He is busy at the moment.
I may be able to help.

619
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,300
The Pentagon has its standard procedures,

620
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,600
and top-notch staff.

621
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,700
Composed of the best experts in the world.

622
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,400
I would rather not disturb
General Drake.

623
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,600
I will speak with the Secretary of State.

624
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,400
I warn you, young lady.

625
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,800
Never do it again.

626
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,100
Yes senator,
now we need this information.

627
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,400
General Watson and I are on our way.

628
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,900
Bergen doesn't appeal to me.

629
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,800
General Watson. I can't believe it,
how high you've gone.

630
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,100
- You could, too, if you wanted to.

631
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,800
- I don't know,
maybe one day.

632
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,100
Watch how you drive, jerk.

633
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,600
- First, learn to drive.

634
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,000
- Do you think I'm undoing the first time?
- The mistake was me undoing it.

635
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,300
Melinda, tell that bastard,
Who reversed first.

636
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,500
- I don't know, I haven't seen it.

637
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,400
Don't we know each other?
- Come on, buddy.

638
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,000
Do you think we were born yesterday?

639
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,700
Ashtabula.
- That's right, Ashtabula. How's it going?

640
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,200
How's it going?
- Great, how about you? What are you doing at the Pentagon?

641
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,400
He is responsible for traffic accidents.
Can I see the driver's license?

642
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,700
I work here.
- No kidding, that's great.

643
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,000
I was counting on you to succeed.

644
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,800
Well, sure, you will pay for the damages

645
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,500
Slater?
- That's right, Bill Slater.

646
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,800
You also look familiar to me.

647
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,500
- It was actually my fault.

648
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,100
Nothing has happened.
Let's go, or we'll be late for the opera.

649
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,400
- Opera? Debbie, after all, we ...
- Debbie Ross.

650
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,800
Do you know Debbie?
- Yes, she's the one who took my clips.

651
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,800
Well, I wanted to give it back to you.
- You can keep it.

652
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,900
I would really like to go out with you,
But I have a date...

653
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,200
- That's okay, I'm going out with Melinda today.

654
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,500
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

655
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,300
I had a great time.
- So did I.

656
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
We will have to do it again.

657
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,900
- Maybe we could have a cup of coffee?

658
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,700
- Rather not.

659
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,300
It's late, and I'm up in the morning.

660
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,900
I like you.

661
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,300
I want to get to know you better.

662
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,900
Will you call?
- Yes.

663
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,300
You will disappoint me,
If you don't.

664
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,600
- I will call.
Good night.

665
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,700
General Kane.
- Thank goodness you are.

666
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,400
I don't know what to do.

667
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,000
- What is the problem, sir?

668
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,200
- This is a key issue in terms of
security of our country.

669
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,300
- Really?

670
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,400
According to our data, you are the
the most competent,

671
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,900
and a trusted Pentagon employee.

672
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,800
- Thank you, sir.

673
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,700
You can't squeak a word
about what I'm about to tell you.

674
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,700
This is top secret information,
Ms. Griffin.

675
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,000
- You can trust me, I won't say a word.

676
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,600
Two months ago, a spy
broke into the computer room,

677
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,700
and deleted all data
on Russian defense systems.

678
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,200
- Yes it's terrible, I've heard about it

679
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,600
When they repaired the typewriter for me.

680
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,700
- Do they know, too?

681
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,700
The press is asking questions.

682
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,400
You shouldn't, General.

683
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,000
I have to, I'm in serious trouble.
And I need help.

684
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,700
Please sit comfortably and relax.

685
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,700
What should I do now?

686
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,400
They will probably take away my stars.

687
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,100
I already know, sir.
Please listen.

688
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,300
I must have an invitation to tomorrow's party,

689
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,800
For the Russian ambassador.

690
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,200
- Of course, whatever you want.
Thank you.

691
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,000
Well Boris, you look healthy.

692
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,800
You have to introduce me
This beautiful woman.

693
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,700
I would like to introduce you to Miss Melinda Griffin.

694
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,500
Melinda, this is Mr. Boris Nabokov,
Russian ambassador.

695
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,400
It is a great pleasure for me
to get to know such an extraordinary being.

696
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,500
- Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

697
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,300
And this is my secretary Tania,
with a name that is too long,

698
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,000
To pronounce them here.

699
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:47,800
Pleasure.

700
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,200
Say Boris, it's true,
That a few of yours have escaped

701
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,800
From the Bolshoi Ballet during performances here?

702
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,100
- Please, today is not the time for business,
Only for pleasure.

703
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,100
We can move our mutual relations
by a big step forward.

704
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,600
Boris, meet my friend.

705
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,000
An excellent chess player.

706
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,500
I see you have caught the eye of my boss.

707
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,400
You speak excellent English.

708
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,500
And also French, Hebrew,
Moroccan, and Italian,

709
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,800
In sign and party language.

710
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,200
- And are you a secretary?

711
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,000
But also a political advisor, astrologer,
oriental masseuse,

712
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,900
tennis coach and sex instructor.

713
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,700
- A sexual instructor?

714
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,700
- All Russian diplomats
have sexual instructors.

715
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,400
This means that you do not provide
such services....

716
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,900
For their country?

717
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,700
- I often give tips, but mostly

718
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,800
I work behind a desk.

719
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,700
- Probably for a good tip.

720
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,500
We have a lot in common,
we should get to know each other better

721
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,500
- Of course.

722
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,300
Even if you smash with missiles
western europe.

723
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,000
Still ours will get you.

724
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,000
And actually we all want the same thing.

725
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,900
I guess you won't deny it?
- Yes, of course.

726
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,200
- What's that?
- Meaning that I...

727
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,500
- That you agree with us?

728
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,200
Then why don't you accept our
zero option?

729
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,900
- If Melinda is that option....

730
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,800
- He will certainly agree to anything,
In the service of the country.

731
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,200
She is a true patriot.

732
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,900
- In that case, I am in favor of it.

733
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,100
This means you will support disarmament,

734
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,600
and start dismantling
European installations,

735
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,900
If we do the same thing?

736
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,200
- I will talk to the prime minister later today.

737
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,600
But I'll have to see what Melinda says.

738
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,500
I will end the cold war for you, Melinda.

739
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,500
- That would be great, Mr. Ambassador.

740
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,800
I just found out,
That the rules at the Pentagon,

741
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,900
Are the same as in the Kremlin.

742
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,900
I suggested for you to
end the Cold War.

743
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,900
- You are teasing me, and that is not nice.

744
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,900
- I'm serious.
Fly to Bermuda with me that night,

745
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,300
And I will withdraw the stupid missiles from Europe.

746
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,900
- It's impossible,
I have to go to work tomorrow.

747
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,400
- No Bermuda.
I told you,

748
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,300
American girls are not
so liberated.

749
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,300
That is, no Bermuda,
then maybe let's go to my place.

750
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,900
- Just a moment, maybe I'll give you a number,
and you will call me....

751
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,200
And have breakfast together.

752
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,600
What can I write on?

753
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:03,000
If Comrade Khrushchev saw you,
he would no longer let you go.

754
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,700
Do I look good?
- Fantastic.

755
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,600
You look great, go now.

756
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,600
- I know, I just think,
Bill is special.

757
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,300
- I always knew he was cute.

758
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,900
Where it takes you

759
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
- Sightseeing.
- For a date?

760
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,000
Some women are pleased
The presence of a man.

761
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,300
Without flaunting money

762
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,700
- I've had that happen, too.

763
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,000
If the ambassador calls,
Let him leave a message.

764
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,300
Do you think Lester
would take me sightseeing?

765
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,100
Come on, they close in 20 minutes.

766
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,500
- Tyko put the briefcase in the trunk.

767
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,500
What's going on?

768
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,500
Who are you?

769
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,800
Let me go.

770
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,800
Help!

771
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:36,200
Good evening, Melinda.
I'm glad to see you.

772
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:40,800
Now I would like you to satisfy
my voyeuristic tastes.

773
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,200
Please take off your shoes,
and show me your feet.

774
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:53,200
- I don't think so, Excellency.

775
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,600
Please without titles,
call me Boris

776
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,200
Why don't you show me your shoulders?

777
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:08,800
- No chance Boris.

778
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:11,200
How about a piece of the belly?

779
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,900
- What kind of girl do you take me for?

780
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,600
I think you know,
That we both know that Melinda.

781
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,200
Let me show you.

782
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,200
How do you like my outfit?
- Charming.

783
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,200
Do you like it when men watch
As you undress?

784
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,100
I can organize it.

785
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,900
- Not necessary, but thank you.

786
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,200
You mean to say...

787
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,300
What are you actually trying to say?
Are you teasing?

788
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,600
You're fast, Boris.

789
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,300
I hope you will satisfy me.
Because you see...

790
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,600
I have to confess something to you.

791
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,300
No American has ever managed to
Satisfy me.

792
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,900
- What a shame, Americans are such faggots,
they lack balls.

793
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,900
- Sad, but true.

794
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:19,600
Americans can do this
for two, maybe three hours one night.

795
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:25,000
But a real Russian Cossack
Even by...

796
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,000
10 or 11 hours
won't let me get there.

797
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,000
You remind me of Cossack, Boris.

798
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,700
- How many hours were you talking about?

799
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,800
- It's not just about time,
but also volume or range.

800
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,600
- Range?

801
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,000
- After all, it's no problem for you.

802
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,000
I know that all rusks
have tank barrels there.

803
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,300
- It's not always hammers,
sometimes sickles.

804
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,700
- Don't worry.
Jetem sure you will confirm in full,

805
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,000
your reputation.

806
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,900
That's my next point Kevin.

807
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,700
We have to assume that she was abducted by the Russians.

808
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,100
Although for now we are treating it
as a possibility.

809
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,900
Not necessarily true.

810
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,600
- Because there is a possibility,
that only

811
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,400
They were impersonating Russians.

812
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Trying to put the blame on them.

813
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,900
Let's order more avocados and tomatoes.

814
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,900
- The press can't find out,
Until we are sure

815
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,300
Who is behind it.

816
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,900
I said no tuna.

817
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I ordered ham and cheese.

818
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,000
I would like to see these treasures of yours.

819
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,700
Take off your clothes, please.

820
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,400
- I'm not cheap, Boris.

821
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,500
- So name your price.

822
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,300
- It's a secret.

823
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,300
- If you don't tell me,
how will I know.

824
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,600
- This secret you
must reveal to me.

825
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,400
- To you?
I don't understand.

826
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,400
- If I have to take off this blouse....

827
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,600
And show you the firmest titties
in this time zone.

828
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,700
Remove.

829
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,400
How many do you have in the Atlantic
Nuclear ships?

830
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:32,400
- It's secret,
I can't tell you.

831
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,400
Now I understand.

832
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,800
I can't say.
My lips are sealed.

833
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,100
- How badzo?

834
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,100
- Very.

835
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,800
- Nothing can be done?

836
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,400
- Not a bit.

837
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,100
How many ships...

838
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,800
How many nuclear ships?

839
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:18,800
60

840
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,100
So she may know some secret information,

841
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
When she worked for the Pentagon.

842
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,000
- The Russians know everything anyway.

843
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,800
- Maybe it's a jealous lover?
- Or some kind of pervert.

844
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,200
Before I pull down my panties,
you must see this pair of legs,

845
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,800
And see where they lead.

846
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,200
- I really want to see them.

847
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,500
Give the location of the radar station
tracking our bombers.

848
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,200
- I can't tell you that.
Over my dead body.

849
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,500
- No?

850
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,800
- Never...

851
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,500
New top-secret installation.

852
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,200
Where is it?

853
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,900
Here you go.

854
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,500
In Yarkutsk, Siberia.

855
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,500
I think it might have been the Russians,

856
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,200
to sabotage my entire operation.

857
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,400
- Are you serious?

858
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,400
Here is mayonnaise, and I said,
I don't want it.

859
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,900
I hate mayonnaise.

860
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,900
Surely you know the access code,
to the Kremlin's military computer.

861
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,900
- I can't.

862
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,500
Even if you were to electrocute me.

863
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,600
Or she burned with cigarettes.

864
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,200
I can't say that.
Never.

865
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:13,200
- Don't you want to try a soft, sweet...

866
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:29,300
Access code for a military computer.

867
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,900
Exactly.

868
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,900
Access code.

869
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,900
This is the date of Karl Marx's birth.

870
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,500
She may have been spying for the CIA.

871
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,300
The Russians have discovered this
and are holding it as a hostage.

872
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,900
They will exchange it for one of the ones held with us

873
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,300
their spies.

874
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,500
We have several of them, don't we?

875
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:12,600
- Yes, but none with such boobs.

876
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:19,000
Now it's time to warm up.

877
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,500
- I thought we had already done it.

878
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,500
- I have my toys here.
- That's cool.

879
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,300
Let's have some fun.

880
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:32,000
What do you feel like doing?
- I think for.

881
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:39,000
I love rough play.

882
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,700
American women are so perky.

883
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,300
Come on.

884
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:55,200
You will pay for it my little Tsarina.

885
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,700
What happened to free love?

886
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,700
That's what I like.

887
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,400
- Agreed, Boris.
Be it to you.

888
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,400
- What are you doing?
- I'm going home.

889
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,800
Help.

890
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,100
Hello gentlemen.

891
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,500
Here you go.

892
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,500
I have been quite busy lately,
conducting reconnaissance.

893
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,600
Friends helped me copy
in triplicate,

894
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,100
all the lost information
from our computers.

895
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,600
- In addition, we have developed a strategy
to paralyze

896
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,300
Russian radar system.

897
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,100
Tracking our bombers.

898
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,300
- This maneuver has a 100% success rate.

899
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,500
We have a willing staff and a guarantee of

900
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,000
lack of retaliation by the Soviet Union.

901
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,400
- The goal is.

902
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,800
Jarkuck in Siberia.

903
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,800
Dimitri.

904
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,800
- Is that all you have to say?

905
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,800
Won't you take care of something else?

906
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,400
- It has been 7 years, 9 months,
and 22 days.

907
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,300
7 years, 9 months, and 22 days
without a woman.

908
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,700
You don't even know.
- Stop it already...

909
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,800
What is it?

910
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,000
- Probably a penguin.

911
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:58,500
- A penguin, or maybe a Koala bear.

912
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,100
Need to check.

913
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,800
We have a problem, Vladimir.

914
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,100
Wait, let me zoom in.

915
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,800
It seems to be an invasion.
Paratroopers everywhere.

916
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:18,000
By the spirit of Lenin, we are already dead.

917
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,800
They are everywhere.

918
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,400
Oh my......,
- What happened?

919
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,400
- This is exactly what we dreamed of.
- About the attack?

920
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,200
Just look at those tits.
- Show?

921
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,400
The sky is full of them.
- Flooding.

922
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,500
This one will be mine.
- Please.

923
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,200
I love you.
- I plead with you, Dimitri.

924
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,800
I need to see.

925
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,100
I want a blonde.

926
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,400
- Get those paws off.

927
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,800
America is beautiful.

928
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,900
And what, should we shoot?

929
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,200
- No, we have to check it first.

930
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,500
I'm quitting this job.
- Me too.

931
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,300
Evening.

932
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,800
Officially announced by the Pentagon
passive action,

933
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,900
code-named "Sky Beavers."

934
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,600
has proven to be extremely effective.

935
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,800
Apparently, radar operators
throughout the Soviet Union.

936
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,500
Under mysterious circumstances
they abandon their posts.

937
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,200
Many ask about the reasons for their behavior.

938
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,500
Here's another seemingly unrelated one,
but surprising

939
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,100
telegram from the White House.

940
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,600
The president has asked Congress
for approval of

941
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,100
new cabinet member.

942
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,500
It looks like we will have
the first female

943
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,900
As Secretary of Defense.
