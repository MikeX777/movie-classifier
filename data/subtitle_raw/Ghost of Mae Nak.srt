1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,833
The legend of Mae Nak
is a tale of true love...

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,069
...and is a tale that Thai people have
been telling for many generations.

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,836
Because one day the Ghost of
Mae Nak will return again...

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,673
...so she can find her true love.
The true love that once was.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,356
Her spirit will never die.

6
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,071
Hey who's there?
It's very late to be knocking...

7
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Who are you? Stop banging!

8
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,760
What are you doing?
Stop banging now!

9
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,109
Stop it! Just stop banging!

10
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,992
Hello. Good morning sir this is
your wake up call.

11
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,434
Nak! Oh I am so glad to hear
your voice. I had another nightmare.

12
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,999
-Mak are you okay?
-Yeah I'm fine. Just a bad dream.

13
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,390
-What do you mean?
-Well this one was...

14
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,318
Well tell me when I see you.

15
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,438
-Okay. Mak loves Nak.
-Nak loves Mak.

16
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,195
Going to work now?

17
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,595
No Father, I'm meeting Nak.

18
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,677
Here, what about your breakfast?

19
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,392
It's okay,
I'll have breakfast with Nak.

20
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,711
We're going to see a house.

21
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,114
They serve breakfast at this house?

22
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,439
No Mother. We'll probably get
something to eat beforehand.

23
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,760
Mother? Father?
Did you hear something last night?

24
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,509
No. nothing.

25
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,518
No. Why?

26
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,669
It must have been nothing. See you.

27
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,870
Nak! Not here. It's too public.

28
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,357
I haven't seen you in twelve hours.

29
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,515
This time I saw her.

30
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,670
Saw what?

31
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,949
This woman.

32
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,990
What woman?

33
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,273
In my nightmare. Her smile was black.
She had no teeth. No gums.

34
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,878
Just shiny black.
It was very real. Very scary.

35
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,674
Well from next week I'll be
sharing the bed with you.

36
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,269
So this woman will have to smile at me
first before she can scare you again.

37
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,950
Maybe a change of home
will improve things.

38
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,911
Let's hope that this Estate Agent
is as true as the words in his ad.

39
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,360
For sale:. Two bedroom house
with kitchen and bathroom

40
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,998
in Phrakanong district.

41
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,510
Needs some attention but...

42
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,839
Yes read on!

43
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,594
...ideal for newly wedded couple.

44
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,951
Asking price 300,000 Baht.
Contact Angel Estates.

45
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,676
It seems too good to be true.

46
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,230
I like the last part best:
"suitable for Newly Wedded Couple"

47
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,113
That'll be us.

48
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,712
You must be the
ten o'clock appointment.

49
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,199
Come on inside.

50
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,713
Sit down.

51
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,311
We've come about the property.

52
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,559
Not so fast! No so fast.

53
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,197
I knew you two would be
coming here today.

54
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,637
Now tell me about yourselves.

55
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,355
Well I'm Mak.
This is Nak, my fiancee.

56
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,910
We are getting married next Saturday.

57
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,080
Excellent. How wonderful.

58
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,797
So that must mean you are interested
in my little house in Phrakanong?

59
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,311
Well. I'm afraid it's sold already.

60
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,755
But you said we are the only ones...

61
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,757
...because we were first to call you.

62
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,712
Just kidding!

63
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,392
I just needed to see
your level of interest.

64
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,756
But I should warn you.
This house does need a few repairs.

65
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,753
Do you want to see it now?

66
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,916
If possible.

67
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,236
Let me find the key then.

68
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,348
What do they mean? These symbols.

69
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,832
They protect me.

70
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,554
Protect you from what?

71
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,319
The key used to be here...

72
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,751
These are so beautiful.

73
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,158
Ah! Here it is.

74
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,955
Phrakanong! You will never find
such a beautiful mix of people

75
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,032
in the whole of Bangkok.

76
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,193
See you're not far from the Skytrain.

77
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,040
Now we have to walk for
a little bit... Just over here.

78
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,240
So who lived in this house before?

79
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,559
There's been several owners.
They don't seem to stay long.

80
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,911
It's been empty for a few years.

81
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,196
You said it is an old house?

82
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,558
It's a very old house.
Probably the oldest in the area.

83
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,915
How old?

84
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,390
Over one hundred years old.

85
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,033
This is going to be
an exciting new area to live in.

86
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,797
They will build condominiums. Soon
all this will change for the better.

87
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,074
The key.

88
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
Like I said it's old.

89
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,112
But it's beautiful.

90
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,157
At the back is the bedroom
and bathroom. Simple but cosy.

91
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,949
We want the house Mr.Angel.

92
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,468
Yes! We'll buy the house.

93
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,672
I knew you two would be ideal
for this place.

94
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,312
So let's begin the paperwork,
shall we?

95
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,151
I'm afraid the garden is a bit wild.

96
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,512
But a little work will fix it.

97
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,913
Sorry. I left my bag inside.

98
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,076
Mak! Come on. I've got to go to work.
They only gave me the morning off.

99
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,556
Hey. They look nice and rich.

100
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,910
Yes, rich for the picking.

101
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
Mak, call me at work.
Let me know that it's confirmed.

102
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,670
No wait and call me at home tonight.

103
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,991
No, no. Call me at work!

104
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,119
Here's the contract for the Phrakanong
house. You sign your name here.

105
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,356
Hello, I'm calling about
the Phrakanong house...

106
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,149
advertised in the
newspaper yesterday...

107
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,909
Please call me back urgently...

108
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,151
Yes hello! I'm calling about
buying the house in Phrakanong...

109
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,070
Leave it too long,
and you might be too late.

110
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,832
But maybe I should speak
to a lawyer first.

111
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,194
The house is not going anywhere.

112
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,671
It's been there
for over one hundred years.

113
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,235
Sign it.

114
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,750
Well done!

115
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,673
This house has been waiting
for you for a long time.

116
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,196
Hello.

117
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,274
It's ours.
Contract signed and sealed!

118
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,314
Really? Oh Mak I know it's so right.

119
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,191
-Nak loves Mak. -Mak loves Nak...
and needs more change!

120
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,480
Excuse me.
Could I look at this one please.

121
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,074
Can I see it?

122
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,797
What is it?

123
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:35,235
It's very old. One hundred...
The price to you..One hundred!

124
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,232
I'll take this one.

125
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,838
Look after it.

126
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,353
It's very fragile.

127
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
It will bring you good luck.

128
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,195
Nak!

129
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,517
-Hi Noi.
-Look these arrived for you.

130
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,228
Mak's such a romantic.

131
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,433
-Did Mak send these? -I don't know.
Have a look at the card.

132
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,400
So tell me. Did you get it?

133
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,790
So did you get it?

134
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,873
Yes we did. Noi it's so perfect.

135
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,158
Sounds so romantic...

136
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,512
-But it needs a little work.
-What does it look like?

137
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,831
Beautiful. Like in a fairy tale.

138
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,913
It's an old traditional house...

139
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,439
-But the wedding is so soon.
-I hope we can get it ready in time.

140
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,679
-Don't worry. Noi and I will help you.
-That's great!

141
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,279
Don't worry. Chai and Noi will help.
Let's talk later.

142
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,556
Matching furniture. That's nice.

143
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,719
-I don't like the colour.
-It's good that it isn't for your home.

144
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,597
Look! There's the king size bed for
that first romantic hot sweaty night.

145
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,749
-I bet it won't be their first
hot and sweaty night. -Why?

146
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,639
Young people have
no control these days.

147
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,197
Hello Mr. Preecha.
This is Mr.Angel.

148
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,034
You're the lawyer for Mr Mak who signed
the contract for the Phrakanong house?

149
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,396
I'd like to make an appointment to
meet you to discuss the contract...

150
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,273
Driver stop here please.

151
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,273
I've got to get up early
to see Master Tring.

152
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,678
-Which Master Tring? -Our Fortune
Teller for the wedding plans.

153
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,028
Why don't you ask him
about me and Chai?

154
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,955
I don't believe a word he says. I'm
doing this for my Mom and Grandma.

155
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,073
Oh, C'mon! It's tradition.

156
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,357
I'm doing it just for you.
I gotta go now.

157
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,432
Bye bye.

158
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,830
Mak. Is that you Mak?

159
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,036
Nak, What's happened?

160
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,753
Have you seen a ghost?

161
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,633
Grandma, you know
I don't believe in ghosts.

162
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,518
Mom, I'm leaving.

163
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,956
Kong!

164
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,230
Nak, aren't you scared
walking through this cemetery?

165
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,029
I don't mind. I've been
walking through this way many years.

166
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,831
By the way, Did you get my flowers?

167
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,237
I'm in a rush Kong.
I don't have time to talk.

168
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,271
And stop sending me flowers!

169
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,798
Don't do it Nak. Do you know
you'll make a big mistake!

170
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,234
Kong, What are you saying?

171
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,592
Don't marry him. You can't do it.

172
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,190
Kong, I don't care what you think.

173
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,398
I am going to marry Mak. I love Mak!

174
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,675
But I love you Nak.

175
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,471
Good morning, Master Tring.

176
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,875
My Mom and Grandma asked me
to tell you that...

177
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,509
we've done everything
you have suggested for the wedding.

178
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,832
Actually, it's not my suggestion.

179
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,473
But what the
astrological readings inform us.

180
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,869
We must live by them.

181
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:14,958
And they will guide us to happiness
and a fulfilling future.

182
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,428
My Mom and Grandma hope that you'll
attend our reception and blessing.

183
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,919
I'll do my best for you, Nak.

184
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,515
Thank you.

185
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,397
Master Tring.

186
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,679
Your first morning reading
is waiting.

187
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,319
Come on then.

188
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,951
I'll leave now.

189
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,913
Wait!

190
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,708
Master Tring would like
completion of payment today.

191
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,437
Yes.

192
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,194
What is this?

193
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,759
There should be another two hundred?

194
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,592
Are you sure?

195
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,517
Oh I thought my Mom said...?

196
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,515
I don't know what your mom said
but there's two hundred Baht missing.

197
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,188
I'm sorry.

198
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,994
I'm so happy for Mak and Nak.

199
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,194
They look so good together.

200
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,796
It's true love.

201
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,554
And when are we going to...

202
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
This present is for both of them.

203
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,160
Thank you. Please go inside.

204
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,553
Mr. Preecha!
I'm so glad that you're here.

205
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,429
Here's to you
and your wonderful wife.

206
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,589
Mak, Mr. Preecha tells me that the
Phrakanong house is a real bargain.

207
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,956
Well it's a good job we have a great
lawyer like Mr Preecha to help us.

208
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,720
Noi, my feet are aching.

209
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,400
-So how is the cake?
-It's yummy.

210
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,557
Look.
Nak, there's your fortune teller.

211
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,154
But he's brought that
seedy housekeeper with him.

212
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,271
He wasn't invited.

213
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,119
Noi, look he's stealing food!

214
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,959
It's a great honour to be able
to attend the wedding of my niece

215
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,429
who I love very much.

216
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,470
And wish both of you to be happy,
prosperous and have children soon.

217
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,756
And to be wealthy.

218
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,995
Thank you all.

219
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,678
Thank you everyone
for being here today.

220
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,835
I know that Nak and I are so happy
that this day has finally arrived.

221
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,669
And is the start of
our new life together...

222
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,234
And we are going to share our life
together, no matter what happens.

223
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,270
So I raise my glass to everyone.

224
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,317
And especially to Nak
who I love very much.

225
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,789
I promise I'll love and look after
her for the rest of my life.

226
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,750
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

227
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,035
Nak you scared me!

228
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,234
What are you eating?

229
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,277
Grandma gave it to me.

230
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,472
It was once a very beautiful look
to have many years ago.

231
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,190
Kiss me Mak and taste some...
Let me see how you look.

232
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,878
It's probably not good for teeth...

233
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,033
here wash your mouth
and drink some water.

234
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,474
Nak!

235
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,313
What is it Mak?

236
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,360
I'm okay. Just got a fright.

237
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,200
What was it? Can you tell me?

238
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,280
Nothing Nak... Let's sleep.

239
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,232
So how are you my Husband?

240
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,835
I'm fine. And how are you my Wife?

241
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,237
I'm fine too.
And did you sleep well my Husband?

242
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,232
Yes my wife...I did...

243
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,200
Oh look what my Grandma gave me.

244
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,352
It's a leaf. Couples used to
chew it many years ago.

245
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,199
But it makes your teeth
and gums shiny black.

246
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,710
Oh you know about it. It was sign of
beauty once. Now we have the opposite.

247
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,229
I guess it's just tradition
to give it.

248
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,431
Nak, I like your teeth white.

249
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,315
Your Father would have loved
your wedding day Nak.

250
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,634
I guess Mr. Preecha will go through
all the paperwork within this week.

251
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,675
Well let me know
if you need more help.

252
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,790
Yes Father.

253
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,635
Let's hope it gets done before
you go on holiday next Saturday.

254
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,438
Krabi is such a beautiful place.

255
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,393
Nak, I don't know if you remember
but Mak's Father and l...

256
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,391
went there 3 years ago.

257
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,312
to celebrate our
25th wedding anniversary.

258
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,877
Well a toast to
Mak and Nak's wedding.

259
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,794
And may they return to Krabi in 25 years
to celebrate their wedding anniversary.

260
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,356
Cheers!

261
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,872
Mak what are you doing...
You'll fall.

262
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,239
Now I get to carry my bride,
my new wife, over the threshold.

263
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,829
Nak!

264
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,999
I'm sure I locked it...

265
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,236
I think someone has broken in.

266
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,471
Our stuff is missing.

267
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,997
Look! Our wedding gifts
have been stolen too.

268
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,793
What did the police say?

269
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,875
There's not much they can do.

270
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,314
Except wait and see if
any of the gifts turn up.

271
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,955
The thieves will probably try and
sell our stuff on the street.

272
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,071
Then we'd have to prove
they were ours.

273
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,758
It's a pity.
They took my wedding suit.

274
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,751
It had a wedding gift
I bought for Nak in it.

275
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,590
It was an antique brooch.
I would like to get that back.

276
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,078
Will you be okay
staying here tonight?

277
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,716
Yes we'll be fine.
This is our house.

278
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,310
What about the neighbours.
Didn't they see anything?

279
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,037
Nothing. Police spoke to them
but no one saw anything.

280
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,998
That's crazy!

281
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,429
You've only got to fart where I live

282
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,028
and a neighbour will come around
to have a good sniff.

283
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,195
Look it's a clock-radio.
I could use this.

284
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,308
We're keeping nothing Tick.
We've gotta' get rid of everything.

285
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,192
We can't be found with any of it.

286
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,117
Why?

287
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,914
That newly married couple
are connected to the police.

288
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,709
We will be in big trouble
if they catch us.

289
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,636
Hey! Stop! Stop!

290
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,435
Mak. I'm here Mak...

291
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,313
It's Nak next to you.

292
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,076
Can you hear me? Mak

293
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,669
Mak...wake up and talk to me.

294
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,430
I'm here Mak.

295
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,471
Can you hear me?

296
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,832
Nak, Doctor has got something to...

297
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,237
Are you Nak?

298
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,959
I'm Doctor Grid.
You must be Mak's wife.

299
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,075
What happened? Why is he like this?

300
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:57,111
We know he was in a hit and run
accident. It has left Mak in a coma.

301
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,914
Coma? When will he wake up?

302
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,440
It's hard to tell at this stage. We
are monitoring him for any responses.

303
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,909
Mak's parent just arrived.

304
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,200
Doctor I'll go with you.

305
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,475
Find Mae Nak.

306
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,716
You must find Mae Nak.

307
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,358
Doctor, Mak spoke to me. He spoke!

308
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,957
Are you sure that Mak spoke to you?

309
00:40:53,560 --> 00:41:03,231
The monitor shows no response at all.
He's been stable...no change at all.

310
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,954
You have to rest.

311
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,231
You have to keep your strength
so you can be with Mak.

312
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,551
You've been at his bedside all day.

313
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,070
You haven't eaten much...
nothing at all.

314
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,435
I've made a congee for you...
eat some.

315
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,151
Here...eat Nak.

316
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,639
Grandma! Mak said something to me
this morning in hospital.

317
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,916
Are you sure he spoke to you?
The Doctor said there was no change.

318
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,192
Yes, he did!

319
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,157
He told me to find Mae Nak.

320
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,511
To find Mae Nak?

321
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,551
But Mae Nak...is a Ghost!

322
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,598
Ghost! What do you mean a Ghost?

323
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,197
What I am going to tell you
is the story of Mae Nak.

324
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,993
Over a hundred years ago,
there was a young woman called Nak.

325
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,035
Nak married a young man named Mak.

326
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,030
They were very much in love.

327
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:27,277
And their marriage
was a true commitment...

328
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,678
They were inseparable. Because they
loved each other very much.

329
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:40,269
And they were blessed with
conception of a child.

330
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:51,479
But then the dream was broken...
her Mak had to go to war...

331
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,910
Mak was seriously injured.

332
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,439
The monks helped him recover.

333
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,273
Soon Mak was ready to return
to his true love...his Nak.

334
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,953
They were together again as a family.

335
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:36,517
But then Mak noticed that
things had changed.

336
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:46,198
Neighbours they knew so well had gone.
People would not stop at their house.

337
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,914
Mak then went home to tell Nak.

338
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,949
The villagers told him she died in
childbirth, and she was now a ghost!

339
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,719
That night the GHOST OF MAE NAK
had her revenge on the village.

340
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,197
The dead were the people that
tried to take Mak away from Nak.

341
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:35,592
She would not let them.
She cursed them and stopped them.

342
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,231
The villagers awake Mak to face
the truth about his young wife.

343
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,632
That she is dead and he has been living
with a ghost who has struck revenge.

344
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,076
on those who tried to
come between her and Mak...

345
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,471
There in the grave was the
decaying body of the young Mae Nak.

346
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,110
Mak's wife and true love...

347
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,513
and next to her their dead child.

348
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,796
The Higher Dignitary performed
an exorcism on Nak and her child.

349
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,474
They were made to rest in peace.

350
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,595
Mae Nak no longer sought revenge

351
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,989
on those who tried to stop
her love between her and her Mak.

352
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,032
Grandma, why did
Mae Nak want revenge?

353
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,670
She wanted to keep the true love she had.
Her love for her Mak was so overwhelming.

354
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,150
It became her obsession,
turned to anger and finally revenge.

355
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,280
You're late Tick!
Where have you been?

356
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,028
The scrap guy is waiting for you.

357
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,078
I know! I know! I had to go
the long way round.

358
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,079
Police are everywhere.

359
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,273
So you need to get to the scrap yard
as soon as possible.

360
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,272
I'm scared Tock!

361
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,271
Call me when it's done.

362
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,158
Murderer! Thief!

363
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,595
Who is this?

364
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,238
Who are you?

365
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,468
Where have you been?

366
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,031
I've been waiting for you.
You're late.

367
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,912
Here's your money.

368
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,400
You can go. I'll do this myself.

369
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,199
Now all the tests show that Mak is
physically normal.

370
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,955
But he is still in his coma.

371
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,358
He has no response at all.

372
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,949
We are going to do
a brain scan today.

373
00:49:53,600 --> 00:50:05,478
Hopefully that will pinpoint
a cause for his state.

374
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,034
Mak's Father told me that
you have got something to tell me?

375
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,469
It's about Mr. Angel the Prakanong house
Estate Agent, who sold the house to you.

376
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,031
But now...

377
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,958
I'm afraid he is dead!

378
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:44,752
He was meant to come to our
wedding reception. Poor Mr.Angel.

379
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,798
Well actually, Mr.Angel was about to
create problems for you and Mak.

380
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,791
Recently, I received
a phone call from him.

381
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,752
Saying that he was going to double
the price of the Prakanong house.

382
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,674
Then I checked the contract
that Mak's signed.

383
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,077
It was there in the small print...

384
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:16,551
that he could increase the price
of the house after one week,

385
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,031
and that it was legal to do so.

386
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,913
Actually, his intention
was never to sell it.

387
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,030
Prakanong House was the
ONLY property Mr.Angel had.

388
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,193
He used it for his
real estate company registration.

389
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:44,036
And he used it to exploit money
from young newly married couples.

390
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,394
Couples like you and Mak.

391
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,399
Why would Mr.Angel do that?

392
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,509
Greed. What other reasons are there?

393
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,519
Maybe he went too far
for this time...

394
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,750
You are very lucky Nak.

395
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:05,075
You and Mak own
a very special property.

396
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,273
If you look at the map.

397
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,151
That is Bangkok today.

398
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,750
This map shows the same area
but over hundred years ago.

399
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,229
What I discovered when I was
investigating the contract...

400
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:34,632
is that Prakanong house
is the oldest house on the map.

401
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,271
Its foundations have been there
for over a hundred years.

402
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,036
Rumour has it that it is also
a land told in legend...

403
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,593
It is said that the Ghost of Mae Nak
used to live there.

404
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,278
You can buy it if you're gonna
look at it that close!

405
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,911
Where did you get this?
This was stolen from my house!

406
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,753
Hey Tock! Come here Tock!

407
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,991
I'll call the police!

408
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,713
Call the police?

409
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,509
Take your hands out of the pocket
or I'll cut it off!

410
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,828
Look she's taken something!

411
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,838
Mak I went to see our Estate Lawyer,
Mr.Preecha, about the house.

412
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,710
He had good news to tell.
The house is finally ours Mak.

413
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,153
Mak look! I found something.

414
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,479
I found the brooch
you brought for me.

415
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,234
It's so beautiful Mak.

416
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,109
It feels so strange.

417
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,838
Very cold.

418
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,269
Mak, feel it.

419
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,396
Mak did you see that?

420
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,080
It was me and you. Our first kiss.

421
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,918
Mak do you remember?

422
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,235
You are lucky Master Tring
will see you at such short notice.

423
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,790
It must be important?

424
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,437
I am saddened to hear about your Mak.

425
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,999
But he is strong.
I'm sure he'll be okay.

426
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:13,794
I'll read his chart for him
and we will see a positive future.

427
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,917
Master Tring I must ask you
about another concern.

428
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,436
Before Mak had his accident,

429
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,034
Mak told me that
he was having nightmares.

430
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,351
And he was being haunted
by a vision of a ghost woman.

431
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:33,799
And when he was in hospital,
he spoke to me from his sleep.

432
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,112
He said "Find Mae Nak!"

433
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,195
Mae Nak? Mae Nak is a ghost.

434
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,512
Yes. My Grandma told me her story.

435
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,113
This is why I come to see you.
To give me an answer.

436
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,800
What did they do to her?

437
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,432
The Higher Dignitary at that time...

438
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:16,637
put a stop to Mae Nak's
curses and vengeance.

439
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:24,351
He exorcised her to rest in peace.

440
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:36,719
The Higher Dignitary removed a
piece of bone from Mae Nak's skull.

441
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,791
He now had Nak's spirit
held in the bone.

442
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,788
Her grave was filled in and forgotten...
Unmarked, lost in the woods and in time.

443
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:07,754
The bone was made into a brooch that
the Dignitary wore until his last day.

444
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,750
What happened to the brooch then?

445
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,348
Legend has it that the brooch
was lost in time.

446
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,157
It is still out there...

447
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,310
But holding Nak's spirit inside.

448
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,393
Nak what is this!

449
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,549
I knew it, I sensed something strong
and evil when you entered the house.

450
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,278
Is this the girdle brooch
made from the bones of Mae Nak!

451
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,598
Take it out! Take it out!

452
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,079
Master! Master!

453
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,468
Master. What is wrong? Master!

454
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,919
What happened?

455
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,998
I ask what happened?

456
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:55,034
Get out! I can deal with this!

457
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,750
Master! Master! Master!

458
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,912
Master is well now but needs rest.

459
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,472
I don't understand what happened.

460
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:25,437
His strong visions overpower him
controlling his body and mind.

461
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,471
He explained to me about
the object you have.

462
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,435
This object is very very valuable.

463
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,829
And must be handled carefully.

464
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:46,679
It's extremely powerful
and can cause you great harm.

465
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,309
So it's true?
This belongs to Mae Nak!

466
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,836
Yes, it is.
Master has asked that I take...

467
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,358
you to a Higher Dignitary
to discuss the outcome of the brooch.

468
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,953
Master does not want it to fall
into wrong hands.

469
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:13,234
It will be very dangerous
for you to keep.

470
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,354
Come let's go now.

471
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,876
Where are you going? Wait!

472
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:45,195
Yes! Yes! That's good price.
Very good.

473
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,753
I tell you my friend
you won't be disappointed.

474
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,355
I'll be with you soon.
Have the money ready!

475
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,115
Mak loves Nak.

476
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,794
Nak loves Mak.

477
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,871
Our love forever and ever and ever.

478
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,556
Nobody comes here anymore.

479
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,560
It used to be a nursery
for young children.

480
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,278
But they had to close it.

481
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,630
Because of the children
seeing the GHOSTS.

482
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:29,633
It was a burial ground
many many years ago.

483
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,113
A burial ground?

484
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:01,917
Kong

485
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,511
Nak

486
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,439
So, what's back there?

487
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,158
What do you want Kong?

488
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,480
I'm sorry to hear
about Mak's accident.

489
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,116
I called your Mom to say I er'...
couldn't come to your wedding.

490
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,234
Then she told me about Mak.

491
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,151
I was shocked Nak.

492
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,839
Are you okay?

493
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:35,436
I kept thinking back to
when your Father died,

494
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,671
and you come to me.

495
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,594
I'm here for you Nak.

496
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,832
Look Kong! You were not
invited to my wedding.

497
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,389
And you have no right
to call my Mom.

498
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:49,320
I told you leave me alone!
Don't you understand?

499
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,640
If Mak doesn't survive, if he dies,
then you will be alone.

500
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,759
But I'll still be here for you.

501
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,473
Forget Mak.

502
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,355
We can make a fresh start Nak?

503
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,236
Get off!

504
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,398
Our love forever and ever and ever.

505
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:35,677
NAK

506
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,876
Mak's Mother and Father have arranged
for a Monk to come and pray for Mak.

507
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,429
It will give him strength.

508
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,358
Noi. Chai.

509
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,996
I need your help.

510
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,193
I want to explain something to you.

511
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,518
I believe that the old nursery
is the burial place of Mae Nak.

512
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,671
Somehow she connected
with Mak through his dreams

513
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,994
and was trying to
tell him something.

514
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,150
Tell him something?

515
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,437
I think she wants to be at peace.

516
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,799
We have to return what is hers.

517
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,756
And how do we do that?

518
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,955
We dig.

519
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,517
We dig and find
the remains of Mae Nak.

520
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,320
Nak are you sure
no one owns this place?

521
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,000
I've checked. We're okay.

522
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,190
But I think we should
speak to the Police first.

523
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,718
And tell them what?
That we are digging for a ghost!

524
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,915
There!

525
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,393
We have to dig here!

526
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,712
Why there Nak?
Why do we have to dig there?

527
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,514
Okay! But if we don't find anything
after 30 minutes, then we go home.

528
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,910
Okay, but now we have to dig.

529
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,791
Some water for you Chai?

530
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,759
C'Mon Chai you've done enough.
Let's go home now...Chai?

531
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,997
Gotta' dig!
The ground's so hard...

532
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,197
Gotta keep digging!
The ground is so...

533
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,678
This is a bone!

534
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,071
It was a baby!

535
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,436
Why is it buried here?

536
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,232
Now we HAVE to call the Police!

537
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,878
No we can't...Not now...
we need to keep digging.

538
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,438
Nak, this needs a serious police
investigation. We have to call them.

539
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,599
Hello Mom! What is it?

540
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,951
Yes I'm with Chai and Noi.

541
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,796
We'll be there right away.

542
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,720
Something serious has happened to Mak.
We've got to go to the hospital now.

543
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,949
Let's go now.

544
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,634
What's about this?

545
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,519
Let's find something to cover it.

546
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:08,917
Nak

547
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,634
What have you been doing?

548
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,716
We've been working on the house.

549
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,552
This is the brain scan of Mak.

550
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,880
We are concerned that there
may be injuries to the brain.

551
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:33,077
Such as a hemorrhage,
that we cannot detect.

552
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:39,909
So we are going to do
intensive tests.

553
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,155
It will show signs
of damage to the brain.

554
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,789
We are treating this as an emergency
procedure and we want to start tonight.

555
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,193
We are worried that Mak's brain...

556
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,111
might be permanently damaged...

557
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,549
Mak! No!

558
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,231
Mak

559
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,869
Mak

560
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,111
Mak

561
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,992
Can you hear me Mak?

562
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,429
Mae Nak!

563
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,395
Mae Nak!

564
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:31,077
I was worried about you Nak.
I had to call the police.

565
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,990
Don't worry Nak I told them I'll
help you. Come back to my place.

566
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,235
Nak!

567
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,514
Noi Chai

568
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:41,398
I found Mae Nak. I found her!

569
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,148
Mak? How is he?

570
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,800
He was taken away.
Doctors cannot help him.

571
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,838
Where is Mak?

572
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,273
They took him away.

573
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,030
No! Nak!

574
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,796
Look! I found Mae Nak.

575
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,631
I gave you...what you wanted...

576
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,718
No!

577
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,149
Grandma

578
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,192
I don't understand.

579
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,833
Why doesn't Mae Nak release my Mak?

580
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,319
Why Grandma?

581
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,957
I will take you
to someone who can help.

582
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,517
Legend says that
the spirit of Mae Nak...

583
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:54,675
was very revengeful on those
who tried to stop her love.

584
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:57,754
She will do them great harm.

585
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:08,832
How are you feeling Nak?

586
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,908
Much better now thanks.

587
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,068
It was a difficult night
for us all last night.

588
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,038
Where is Mak now?

589
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,878
He is in safe hands now.

590
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,636
He was taken to a monastery
where they will help him.

591
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:27,153
The monks will remove the spirit
that possesses him.

592
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,117
We have given them
our permission for an exorcism.

593
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,991
Mrs.Grimm?

594
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,239
Are you there?

595
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,270
I have brought my granddaughter
Nak here. She needs your help.

596
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,390
Who is it?

597
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,320
Can't you remember my voice?

598
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,748
Yes. Come in, come inside.

599
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,871
How wonderful it is to have you
visit us with your grandmother.

600
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,149
So you must be Nak?

601
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:48,392
I remember you when you
were a little girl.

602
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,994
And I remember her grandmother
when she was a young girl.

603
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,640
Oh don't talk about
such ancient times.

604
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,310
May I touch your face Nak?

605
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:05,237
It's how Mrs.Grimm sees you.

606
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:07,909
Yes, of course.

607
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,994
There now I can see you Nak.
You are very beautiful.

608
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:27,470
Now let's find out how
we can help you young Nak.

609
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,560
Come inside the house.

610
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,799
Mrs.Grimm is tuning
into the spirit world.

611
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:44,632
She has been a spiritualist
all her life.

612
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:49,756
Oh I nearly forget...This may help.

613
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,119
Nak was holding it all last night.

614
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,273
Ah! Wonderful!

615
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,638
Let Mrs.Grimm hold it. It may help.

616
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:16,198
You are surrounded by pure love,
young Nak.

617
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:31,515
The presence that
this belongs to...

618
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,515
is reaching out to you
through this pure love.

619
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,832
The presence is a woman.

620
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,470
A woman who is not at peace.

621
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,274
Who cannot rest.

622
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,314
The presence is with us.

623
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,353
She's here with us.

624
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,156
We sense that you are with us here.

625
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,676
Will you talk to us? Yes or no?

626
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:27,151
Will you communicate with us?
Yes or no?

627
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,954
Will you come through to us?
Yes or no?

628
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,959
We are here to help you.

629
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,912
What is your name?

630
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,112
Will you speak to us?
Yes or no?

631
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:47,471
Yes.

632
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,028
What is your name?

633
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,000
Do we know you?

634
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,750
Are you connected to us?
Yes or no?

635
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,476
No.

636
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,719
What is your name?

637
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:04,751
Nak.

638
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,349
Mae Nak.

639
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:15,873
Is there someone here
you wish to communicate with?

640
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,395
Nak.

641
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,998
Will you speak to Nak?
Yes or no?

642
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:29,236
Will you tell us why
you are not at rest?

643
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,594
Speak to Nak.
Nak is with us here.

644
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,637
What do you want of Nak?

645
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,477
Nak. Help me.

646
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:41,636
Help me.

647
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,998
Why do you feel no peace?

648
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,232
What help do you need?

649
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,070
Speak to Nak. Nak is with us.

650
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,914
Release me.

651
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,834
Release me.

652
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,838
Release me. Release me!

653
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,713
Release me. Release me.
Release me!

654
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:18,319
The spirit of Mae Nak has been
awoken by the true love

655
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,789
that you and your Mak
have for each other.

656
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:29,638
It is the love that
she once had and misses deeply.

657
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,960
I did everything I could.

658
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,632
I searched until I found her.

659
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,830
And you must continue young Nak.

660
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,600
But what does she want?

661
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:52,070
You must return
what belongs to Mae Nak.

662
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:07,557
Nak, I must warn you that
your Mak is in great danger.

663
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:17,110
Your grandmother told me about the
exorcism they plan to do on Mak tonight.

664
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,231
They will do him great harm.
You must stop them Nak.

665
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,553
Nak, what are you doing here?

666
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,037
Chai, I need your help.

667
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:56,790
I need to go to the Police morgue.

668
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,951
Come on Nak. You're going to create
serious problems for yourself.

669
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:08,753
Please Chai you must help me.
This will be the last time I promise.

670
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,113
Look Nak this whole thing has
caused a strain between Noi and l.

671
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,678
Noi is worried I may lose my job.

672
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,637
Chai, I just need you to help me get
inside the Police morgue, that's all.

673
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,797
I have to help Mak.

674
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,720
Mak is in good hands now.
The monks are taking care of him.

675
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,680
You'll make things worse for him.

676
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,435
Chai you must help me.

677
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,398
If you don't help me Chai
you could be in danger too.

678
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,149
Mae Nak can do strange things.

679
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:42,030
Stop it. Enough talk about ghosts
and bones and such crazy nonsense!

680
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,430
Nak!

681
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:36,791
Touch this.

682
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:43,271
If you don't help me you'll be
in great danger Chai.

683
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:46,120
Mae Nak won't let anyone stop her.

684
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:55,830
Happy now?

685
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,840
Okay Nak I'm going to
drive you home.

686
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,032
And then I'll have some explaining
to Noi because I'll be late and...

687
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,600
I work in the pay-roll department.
I need to collect the job sheets.

688
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:28,277
They were meant to be sent over today.
So I came over myself.On my way home.

689
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:30,920
You guys need to get
paid this month right?

690
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,557
-Okay.
-Thanks.

691
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,591
Quickly Nak. Get under here.

692
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,148
You might need
this flashlight inside.

693
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,910
Hey where are you taking that?

694
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,960
It was blocking the entrance.
I'm just returning it.

695
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,430
Returning it?
Returning it where?

696
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,874
That's my job.

697
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:22,198
Hello? Yeah. Where are you?

698
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:28,553
I can't come. I'm working tonight.

699
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,871
Have a guess who I'm with.

700
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:46,799
That man who got
sliced in two by glass.

701
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,038
It's been mad busy all week.

702
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,550
We've got that train guy in too.
Lost his head. Clean off.

703
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:56,071
Some other guy got burnt alive.

704
01:32:56,840 --> 01:33:00,958
Hang on. The other phone's ringing.
I gotta' go. See you tomorrow.

705
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,673
Our love for ever and ever.

706
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,556
And look after each other forever.

707
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,789
I've done everything
you want me to do.

708
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:11,869
Now you give back Mak to me.

709
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,557
Give my Mak back to me!

710
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:16,235
Mak!

711
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,800
Mae Nak can rest in peace now.

712
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,832
This is what she wanted us
to help her with.

713
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,351
They say that this temple is also
the resting place of her Mak.

714
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:33,878
He is telling you that we will
burn the coffin tonight.

715
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:38,279
This will complete
the religious ceremony.

716
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,628
Everything's all done now.

717
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,077
Now you'll be happy together.

718
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:58,353
Nak, come and look at this photo.

719
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:03,757
Mak.

720
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,555
Come and be with me Mak.

721
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:14,232
No! I'm not your Mak.

722
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,996
Don't you remember me Mak?

723
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,474
Where is Nak?

724
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,593
Where is my wife?

725
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,995
Mae Nak...

726
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,038
I'm not your Mak.

727
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,079
Give me back my wife.

728
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,596
Please Mae Nak!

729
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,711
Give me back my wife.

730
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,590
Chai...I need to borrow your car.

731
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,753
No time to explain!

732
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:02,397
Help me please!

733
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,119
Mak!

734
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,954
Please help me!

735
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,395
Mak

736
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:31,752
Help me. There's somebody in here!

737
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,755
Mak! Help me.

738
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:44,799
Nak!

739
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:46,868
Nak!

740
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:48,835
Nak!
