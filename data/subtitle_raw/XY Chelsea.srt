I don't know. I just
like coming-of-age stories.

4
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,333
There's something about them.

5
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,709
Not...

6
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,291
...hero versus villain.

7
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:15,625
Maybe it's the trans
part of me that feels like

8
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,875
life is a coming-of-age story.

9
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm not the person
that people think I am.

10
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:30,041
I just know that.

11
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,250
Hold on.
I've got to take this call.

12
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,583
I've got to take this call.

13
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,250
Hello.

14
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,250
Hello?

15
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,917
Hello?

16
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,083
Yes, it is.

17
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:03,917
I do.

18
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,041
Oh, my God.

19
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,792
-  Oh, my God!

20
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,625
What did he commute it to?

21
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,875
Oh.

22
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,959
Oh, I can't tell you...

23
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,125
I can't tell you how happy I am.

24
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,542
Thank you so much. How do I...

25
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,125
He's gonna announce it
in a couple of minutes?

26
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,291
And how do we tell her?

27
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,625
Vince!

28
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,917
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

29
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:50,125
I just got a call
from the President's counsel.

30
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,709
It's commuted plus 120 days.

31
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,834
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, the...

32
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,291
Let's do it out here.

33
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,166
The President's counsel
just called me.

34
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,208
He's gonna announce it
in a couple of minutes.

35
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,959
I'm pretty speechless.

36
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,542
I'm gonna start crying.

37
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,083
Holy shit!

38
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,792
Fucking shit.

39
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:18,041
It's just...

40
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,834
I just... I just...

41
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,542
I can't even fucking...

42
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,959
It's crazy.

43
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,166
Jesus fucking Christ.

44
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,583
First of all...let's be clear,

45
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:39,458
Chelsea Manning has served

46
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,125
a tough prison sentence.

47
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,792
The sentence that she received
was disproportionate

48
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:51,291
relative to what other leakers
had received.

49
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:56,792
She took responsibility
for her crime.

50
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:03,792
It made sense to commute,
and not pardon, her sentence.

51
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:07,291
- Nancy just got the order...
- I just got it.

52
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,208
...with the Barack Obama
signature.

53
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:12,041
- Oh, my God!
- So that is in possession.

54
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,875
Oh, God.

55
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,542
- This is a lot to process.
- Yeah, it is.

56
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,417
- These types of huge changes.
- Yeah, yeah.

57
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,583
So...

58
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,500
You know, we're here, Chelsea.
We're thrilled for you.

59
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,000
But it doesn't mean
it's all just simple.

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,625
- An inmate

61
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,208
at a military
correctional complex...

62
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,792
- ...Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

63
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,083
This call is from
a correction facility

64
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,917
and is subject to monitoring
and recording.

65
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,959
This is a prepaid call from...

66
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,083
- Manning.

67
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,709
Hey. So, you're on today's
New York Times.

68
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,166
And your story is
upper right-hand corner, baby.

69
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,083
Yay!

70
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,500
He had to be a human being
for this to work.

71
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,041
We didn't know
if he was or not, right?

72
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,458
I didn't know.

73
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,333
Yeah?

74
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,417
I got the Elle  magazine.

75
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,333
Hold on.
I'm running off to get it.

76
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,834
Where did that thing go?
Oh, here it is.

77
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:58,041
I got the Elle.
They didn't have Marie Claire.

78
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,000
But it's gonna
come in tomorrow.

79
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,458
Yes. And bow...

80
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,083
And a bow.
Bows on the shoulders.

81
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,208
Yes?

82
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,625
Six women.

83
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,417
- Far left. A little suit.
- Yeah.

84
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,542
Yeah. That's cute.

85
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,959
- Vincent?
- Yes, ma'am.

86
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,041
Commander, sir. I'm gonna be
there to make sure she's safe.

87
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,375
- That's great.
- You know, we did her clemency.

88
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,709
We're her clemency lawyers.

89
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:49,041
We're gonna make sure
this clemency happens.

90
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,375
She's really worried

91
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,250
that she's gonna
do something stupid.

92
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,041
What does that mean?

93
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,625
Well,
what she kept saying was,

94
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,542
"I might run away. You guys
should be aware of that."

95
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,291
And I said, "You're not...

96
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,083
Once you're with us,
you won't be able to run away."

97
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,333
I don't think people realize
how traumatic

98
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,667
getting out of jail is.

99
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,583
Imagine going from
being in the military

100
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,500
- to being incarcerated.
- I know.

101
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,417
Because people who are
in the military and get out

102
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,709
- have difficulty transitioning.
- That's right.

103
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,083
She needs to go figure out
her life.

104
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,417
Having been in the military,

105
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:27,709
I can't imagine
making a decision like that.

106
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:30,417
I just can't.
No chance I would've done that.

107
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,500
It takes a rare
historical person

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,250
who is willing to sacrifice
personal freedom

109
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,500
and all the privileges of life,

110
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,875
doing what he or she thinks
is the right thing to do.

111
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,333
You have to have a little bit
of a sense of self-importance

112
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,041
about yourself...

113
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,125
...a bit of ignorance...

114
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,792
...a little bit of
a sense of optimism.

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,125
Mostly, they're just people
who, deep down,

116
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,375
feel as though
there's some problem

117
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,625
or something's really wrong.

118
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,166
Yeah.

119
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,625
I'm particularly bitter
that a Commander in Chief,

120
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,125
in a time of war,
would pardon a traitor.

121
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,208
Republican
House Speaker Paul Ryan

122
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:09,500
released a statement saying,

123
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,667
"Chelsea Manning's treachery
put American lives at risk."

124
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:15,375
This young man
or woman, or whatever,

125
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,709
should have been hung.

126
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,208
I don't think it's right.

127
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,208
She should serve her time.
35 years.

128
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,291
100 years ago,

129
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,542
they'd have just taken him out
and shot him.

130
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:31,667
The debate about
how much harm was caused,

131
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,291
or wasn't,
by her actions, is ongoing.

132
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,458
National security officials
will tell you

133
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,041
Manning gravely harmed
national security.

134
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,208
So far as
actually killing someone,

135
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,875
there's absolutely no credible
allegation of that happening.

136
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,959
And another factor,
as you alluded to,

137
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,208
seems to be the stress for
Manning's gender transition.

138
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,375
Chelsea Manning

139
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,542
attempted to commit suicide
twice last year.

140
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:55,083
Is it clear that
the gender transition concern

141
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,583
was part of this, that she'd
been going through...?

142
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,583
It seems to be.

- Another day.
- Hey.

147
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,500
Another day in the woods.

148
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,583
God,
it's such a beautiful sight.

149
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,834
I wasn't handling it
very well initially.

150
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,709
- You...
- Aargh.

151
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,542
We were in an actually
incredibly stressful situation

152
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,542
where I thought
I was gonna vomit.

153
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:35,750
- Um, so...
- You wanted to vomit, too?

154
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,875
Yeah. I really did.
I was, like, "Oh,

155
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,792
I'm gonna be super embarrassed

156
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,959
if I throw up in front of
these security guys."

157
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,750
- We're still trying to adjust.
- Yeah.

158
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,834
To find a soft landing.
So, I think, today,

159
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:50,875
just kind of...
vegging out a little bit

160
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,417
and, like, you know,
like, learning.

161
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,583
Learning how to...

162
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,083
I mean, for me,
learning how to...

163
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,625
Yeah.

164
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,875
...be again.

165
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,709
Yeah, fuck,
I mean, you're, like...

166
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,667
- Fuck.

167
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,917
- It's still sort of amazing.
- Yeah.

168
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,125
And unimaginable,
like, this is...

169
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,834
...this is where you are

170
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,250
on May 17, 2017.

171
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,250
- Yeah.
- And not 2045.

172
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,834
- How the fuck did I get here?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,125
You ever find yourself
asking yourself that?

174
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,500
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- "How did I get here?"

175
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,333
Yeah.

176
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,583
It just feels so natural
for me to do whatever I want...

177
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,667
- Yeah. Yeah.
- ...in nature.

178
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,709
You get past this idea

179
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:40,959
of, like,
"Oh, a miracle might happen."

180
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,458
I mean, I was in prison
for the rest of my life.

181
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,959
There was a lot of
people that...

182
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,417
didn't think
it was worth the effort,

183
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:55,875
didn't think Obama
would consider it,

184
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,125
it was never gonna happen.

185
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,917
It was a shot in the dark.

186
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,041
I am not a make-up artist,
by any means.

187
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,583
I had to learn in prison,

188
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,166
making shit up
as I went along.

189
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,083
I'm sure there's a bazillion
tutorials on YouTube.

190
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,250
There's a disproportionate
number

191
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,083
of trans women in the military.

192
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:38,417
You know? Like something...

193
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:41,125
Something about, like,
our twenties,

194
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,417
and I was, like, running away
from, you know...

195
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,500
...this... this weird problem

196
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,875
that, like, we're cross-dressing
and stuff.

197
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:54,458
Like, I was trying to,
like, man up and...

198
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,834
I... I think
I'm not alone in that.

199
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,709
There's a lot of
social pressure,

200
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,000
especially for people
in, like, the South

201
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,083
and people in the Southwest,
and the West.

202
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,583
Um...

203
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, I think there's
a pressure to...conform,

204
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,667
and what better
conformity environment

205
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,917
than the military?

206
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:16,542
So...

207
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,875
I saw it as kind of like
going cold turkey from, like...

208
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,333
a drug addiction or something,

209
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,750
or, like, trying to quit
cigarettes or something.

210
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,250
But, obviously, you can't stop
being who you are.

211
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,917
So, that was always...
never gonna happen.

212
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,250
And this is a fantastic
shade of lipstick.

213
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,750
I could hear the river from...

214
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,834
prison, on a non-windy day.

215
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,125
Because there was
the Missouri River...

216
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,125
...right outside the uh...

217
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,083
right outside
the prison itself.

218
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,333
Through the tree...

219
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,250
If you go beyond
the treeline of the prison,

220
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,208
there's the river...um...

221
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,792
And...so, but...

222
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,834
I haven't heard
a stream like this.

223
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,792
This is just... It's nice.

224
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,834
It's nice to have a stream.

225
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:28,792
It's nice to have leaves,
you know?

226
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,875
What story?

227
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,458
Uh... That's a good question.

228
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:51,709
♪ brooding instrumental music ♪

229
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:05,166
I grew up in a small
town: Crescent, Oklahoma.

230
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,917
I had a...complicated
relationship with my father.

231
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,750
You know, like, he would
just...

232
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,667
take his anger out,
from being...

233
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,041
...angry at work, and just...

234
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,750
My mother,
she would drink pretty heavily.

235
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,041
My father drank very heavily.

236
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:35,375
And they finally split up
when I was 13.

237
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,542
My father had a new wife.

238
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:45,291
She didn't like the fact
that I even existed.

239
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:51,375
She saw that, you know,
I was dating boys and...

240
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:54,125
...eventually she had me
removed from the house...

241
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,208
...and I was homeless.

242
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,375
All Americans know that
the stakes in Iraq are enormous.

243
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,250
On television every night,

244
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,000
you'd see images
of the Iraq surge.

245
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,041
It was chaos.

246
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,041
I am saying we must
significantly increase...

247
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,208
That realization
that I was on thin ice

248
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,166
and that I didn't know
who I was,

249
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,583
and that I needed meaning.

250
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:25,333
I understand the consequence
of committing people into war.

251
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,166
So, I enlisted in the Army.

252
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,166
I did it kind of on a whim.

253
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,583
They needed people,
I signed the paperwork.

254
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,166
And a few days later,
I was in basic training.

255
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,667
Oh, shit!

256
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,542
Where the fuck
did you come from?

257
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,333
Shit.

258
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,000
Yep.

259
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,333
What's up?

260
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,542
Lisa just says, "Great photo."

261
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,000
You know,
I'm just making sure...

262
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,750
Disconcerting amount
of boobage there.

263
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,542
Like, my eye is drawn to it,
so I'm just, like...

264
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,250
...super aware of the fact

265
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,542
that dresses expose
a lot more skin

266
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,417
and it's uh...

267
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,166
I don't know if my body
movements are trained yet

268
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:06,041
for this kind of thing.

269
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,500
You're moving around a lot
and you're not used to it.

270
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,166
There's always the possibility
of, "Oop, there you go."

271
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,583
The whole world could see.

272
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,542
And I had that in prison, too.

273
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:19,375
You know, I was definitely
scrutinized by...

274
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,792
prison staff, you know...

275
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:25,208
inmates, visitors, you know?

276
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,625
Because even though I wore
a loose-fitting uniform,

277
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,208
you could tell...
you know, they could tell.

278
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,667
And they...
I could sense the judgment.

279
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:36,041
Guards would walk in
on me sometimes

280
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,458
while I'm doing... You know,
while I was changing my shirt

281
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:43,375
or, like, taking my bra off
or putting it on, or whatever.

282
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,375
So, you know, stuff happened
and people would go...

283
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:50,417
And then there are
strip searches, so...

284
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:53,542
Their reactions
could sometimes be...

285
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,041
...you know...

286
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,750
...complicated.

287
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,417
Human.

288
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:17,417
I remember it was
a really hot and muggy day.

289
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:25,041
The lawyers advised
against coming out

290
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,875
in the middle of
a court martial.

291
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,542
They thought it would be
misinterpreted

292
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,250
as some kind of stunt
or something.

293
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,125
But I came to the conclusion
that I needed to just

294
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:40,792
come out publicly.

295
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,041
As I transition into
this next phase of my life,

296
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,291
I want everyone
to know the real me.

297
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,375
I am Chelsea Manning.
I am a female.

298
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,583
I'm confused, Bill.

299
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,875
I don't care if you call him
a he or a she.

300
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,458
He's a traitor.
She's a traitor.

301
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,709
You had these rumors.

302
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:10,166
"What does it mean
that Manning is really a woman

303
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,709
or is claiming to be a woman?"

304
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:14,959
"Did she leak the documents
because she's transgender?"

305
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:17,208
This is late January, 2010.

306
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:21,208
I came back from Iraq,
on leave.

307
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,417
And I came to an empty house.

308
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,709
It was...surreal.

309
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:39,792
I had this sense
of disconnect.

310
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,166
People were living
normal lives

311
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,375
while we were killing
or being killed.

312
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,500
Thank you
for calling the  New York Times.

313
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,375
..for calling
the  Washington Post.

314
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,250
News outlets,
they didn't care.

315
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,959
- It wasn't newsworthy to them.

316
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,333
The notion of the Iraq War

317
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,000
has left the consciousness.

318
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,583
I'm trying to do
something different.

319
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:21,083
I have all these documents
and I have the data

320
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:23,458
and I need to do
something with it.

321
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,291
We have no reason to doubt

322
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:58,709
the reliability
of these documents.

323
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:02,041
It is up to a court to decide...

324
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,792
...clearly, whether something
is, in the end, a crime.

325
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,125
That said, prima facie,

326
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,125
there does appear to be

327
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,333
evidence of war crimes
in this material.

328
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,000
We also have one individual,

329
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,917
uh...appears to be wounded,
trying to crawl away.

330
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,667
Come on, buddy.

331
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
All you gotta do
is pick up a weapon.

332
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,208
They're taking him!

333
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,458
Bushmaster, Crazy Horse 1-8.

334
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,208
Come on, let us shoot.

335
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,333
This is Bushmaster 7.
Go ahead.

336
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,375
Roger, we have a black SUV,
uh, Bongo truck

337
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,750
picking up the bodies.

338
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,875
Request permission
to engage.

339
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:13,375
Bushmaster 7. Roger.

340
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,709
This is Bushmaster 7.
Roger. Engage.

341
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:18,208
1-8. Okay. Clear.

342
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,542
- Come on.

343
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,959
- Clear.

344
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,458
- Clear.
- We're engaging.

345
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,417
- Come around. Clear.
- Roger.

346
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,750
Hacker Adrian Lamo,
who turned him in,

347
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,291
says that he contacted
the Army

348
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:17,625
after a series of very intense
email exchanges

349
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,959
with the Army specialist
in late May.

350
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,250
Adrian Lamo claims
that Manning was unhappy

351
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,375
with some policies
in the military.

352
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,875
He said that there was
an ideology problem,

353
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:31,333
that he had leaked

00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,375
to the website WikiLeaks.

355
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,291
Now, among the charges,
of course, the most serious one

356
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:47,667
for Private Bradley Manning,
that of aiding the enemy.

357
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:49,625
In a way,
it's the sheer scale of it

358
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:50,792
that's hurt America's image.

359
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,792
That a vast volume
of sensitive documents

360
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,625
was so easily available
to a private soldier

361
00:29:56,625 --> 00:29:58,000
with some hacking skills.

362
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
The United States Of America
is on trial today.

363
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,750
Let him go!

364
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,750
Manning stood up
as an American soldier,

365
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,709
put himself in harm's way,

366
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:10,750
and he should be free.

367
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,709
No, ma'am.

368
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,625
You've been
invisible for so long...

369
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,291
Yeah.
- ...people have already...

370
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,709
formed their own opinions
of who you are.

371
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:01,583
I feel pressure
to correct that and to, like,

372
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,458
clear that up.

373
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:09,000
I was an unknown before.

374
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,375
It's a little bit
nerve-racking.

375
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,959
I'm not... I'm not ashamed
of anything.

376
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,500
I'm not ashamed
of being trans.

377
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,959
I'm not ashamed
of what happened.

378
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:33,709
Everything happened
and, like...

379
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:35,333
I'm okay with that.

380
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,333
Yeah? And...

381
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,417
The main thing that I had
to do was just let go...

382
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,834
of other people's expectations.

383
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,333
And that was tough.

384
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:53,000
It was one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do

385
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,917
because I had built my life

386
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:57,500
around other people's
expectations.

387
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,542
And I'm not gonna
fucking do that any more.

388
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,583
It does feel a little
bit like a calm before a storm.

389
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:18,166
We know how fragile she is.

390
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,083
What I worry about
is that she'll be a big name

391
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,875
and there'll be all this press
that'll happen,

392
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:31,542
and then all of a sudden,
it'll be over

393
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,291
and she'll just be
out there on her own.

394
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:39,667
We make these
in the wood shop,

395
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,792
but we don't paint ours.

396
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,083
We put oil on ours.

397
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,792
We made Adirondack chairs
at the prison.

398
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,458
Yeah.

399
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,291
Oh, it'll be like that
for a few weeks, I'm sure.

400
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,667
God, I missed
trying to do this.

401
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,583
- I feel old.

402
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,792
- Feel old?
- Yeah.

403
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,125
I lost...

404
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,375
I've lost seven years
of my life already.

405
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,375
That's unfair.

406
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,625
Last time
I walked down these streets,

407
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:01,875
down the streets of this city,

408
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,959
Lady Gaga had just become big

409
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,500
and the Iraq War
was still going on.

410
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:13,542
It just feels like I've been
through a time machine.

411
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:14,875
Time warp.

correctional complex...

413
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,000
- ...Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

414
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,333
Where do you think
he got that idea?

415
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,291
All I was trying to get at

416
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:14,625
was this whole idea
of personal responsibility

417
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:18,208
that you seem to feel,
even though, of course,

418
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,792

419

You know,

- Look at you.

444
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,291
- How different do I look?

445

00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:53,750

- Not even a little.

It's amazing to me.

00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:13,208
that hormones
changed that much

455
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:16,458
of, like...bone structure?

456
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,542
No, it doesn't change
the bone structure.

457
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,125
Well, it changed...
It changed something.

458
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,291
It changes how the skin, like...

459
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,917
how the skin wraps around
the bones a little bit.

460
00:40:27,917 --> 00:40:30,166
Okay.
It's just so much different.

461
00:40:30,917 --> 00:40:32,792
- It's really different.
- Yeah.

00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:34,333
Yeah.

468
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,542
Shit.

469
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,291
Even I didn't realize how much
you were hurting, Chelsea.

470
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,291

Very good at...?

474
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,250
You know, she watched
the firework celebration

475
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,583
from her window...

476
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,083
and then she took
the shoestrings

477
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:32,625
that were, you know,
on her boots,

478
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,250
attached them to a vent
hanging from the ceiling,

479
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,625
put a pillowcase
over her head...

480
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:43,250
bound her hands
and her legs,

481
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,417
and then the next thing
that she remembers, actually,

482
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,667
is being on the floor.

483
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:55,000
She was unconscious...

484
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,500
...and it could have
very well worked.

Um...

512
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,709
So, you'd looked at
the documents,

513
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:14,458
and you made the judgment

514
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,625
that they wouldn't harm
any individuals

515
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:19,291
before you disclosed them?

00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:21,500

00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:58,583
We're in a moment of history,
where this stuff is important

531
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,333
and I don't want to
screw it up for somebody else.

532
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,542
One of the things that's nice

533
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:22,458
is, like, when you have
a historical figure like this,

534
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,291
is there is
something that's um...

535
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:28,166
...that's quite powerful
about being so up close.

536
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:30,792
But there's also something
very powerful about seeing

537
00:47:30,792 --> 00:47:33,041
her entire body,
like, head to toe.

538
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,875
She's, like...the entire figure
is present on this cover.

539
00:47:37,709 --> 00:47:41,375
I love how she just totally...

540
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,375
uh...seems at ease.

541
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,041
I like this one
because it has...

542
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:47,250
It feels to me enormous power,

543
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,834
the kind of power
that she must have

544
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:50,709
to be the person she is.

545
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:55,250
There's something about
the atmosphere of that picture,

546
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,083
like, there's a sense
of narrative to this one...

547
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,625
Yeah.

548
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,750
There's also, like,
some vague suggestion

549
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,500
of, like, an interrogation,
or something like that,

550
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,667
sitting in the chair,

551
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,500
in a kind of, like,
stripped-down room.

552
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,583
And for her first time,
sort of, sitting down

553
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:12,291
and telling her story,
I think that works.

554
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:20,083
Alright. You ready
to go on the record?

555
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:22,917
About how many weeks
into the second deployment

556
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:25,917
did you get in touch
with WikiLeaks?

557
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:28,458
It was all one deployment,
but after, it was...

558
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:31,417
It was uh...
It was during leave...

559
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:33,750
It was during
my leave that I...

560
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,792
that I started using the site.

561
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,875
It was never about
being caught.

562
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:44,166
I...wanted
the information out.

563
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:46,792
Uh...

564
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:49,041
I was eventually going
to go public.

565
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:50,959
- You were?
- Yes.

566
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:53,125
I just didn't know
how to do that.

567
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:09,625
Yes, I was worried that
being trans would be...

568
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:11,542
would take over
everything else.

569
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,625
Right.
I was worried it would...

570
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,500
It would be used against me.

571
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,917
I wanted people to know then
the things I was seeing.

572
00:49:35,959 --> 00:49:38,542
Life was cheap in Iraq.

573
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:46,542
And it made me realize

574
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:50,041
that... how precious
life actually is.

575
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:55,166
How precious
everyone's life is.

576
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,667
♪ tense music ♪

577
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:58,125
That's right.

578
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:19,709
This is a war
that resulted in the deaths

579
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,959
of hundreds of thousands
of Iraqis,

580
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:26,125
four and a half thousand
American soldiers...

581
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:39,417
It was also a war
that we sped into

582
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:43,166
in no small part because of
government secrecy.

583
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:46,250
How can a nation function

584
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,208
if we don't know
what we've done?

585
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,667
And the finale of this war,

586
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:28,375
that started under cover
of secrecy and lies,

587
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:32,166
ends with the prosecution
and court martial

588
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:34,875
of someone
who got the truth out.

589
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,250
Mm.

590
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:13,583
He was good.

591
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,375
Oh...

592
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:18,792
So sorry, sweetheart. Um...

593
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,792
Ch-Ch-Chelsea.
I'm getting used to it now.

594
00:54:22,667 --> 00:54:24,291
Slowly.

595
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,792
It's tough. Tough.

596
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,000
He was always my baby.

597
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,834
He was always my...

598
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:38,458
...Bradley. Hm.

599
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:46,625
He had the box room,
where he slept in.

600
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,792
And he had
how many computers?

601
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,125
I think it was...
one, two, three...

602
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,375
Three computers set up.

603
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:02,583
And he had this desk chair,

604
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,166
on rollers.

605
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,208
Ah.

606
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:14,000
And... Oh! And it was locked.

607
00:55:14,792 --> 00:55:16,542
There was a bolt.

608
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:19,834
I used to say, "That's one room
I don't have to clean."

609
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:37,291
I can't remember.

610
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,125
Quant... Quant-something.

611
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,375
That's it.

612
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:46,125
It was a cinder block,
cinder block,

613
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,375
and just two chairs.

614
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:56,250
I-I didn't say a lot because...

615
00:55:57,375 --> 00:55:59,166
...I don't know.

616
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,125
He's, like...

617
00:56:04,417 --> 00:56:06,709
I couldn't touch, couldn't hug.

618
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:10,250
He was, like...

619
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:14,125
Oh.

620
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:17,625
Sorry. But I do love you.

621
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,208
And if I could hug you,

622
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:24,250
I'd give you the biggest hug
you ever had.

623
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,917
It's ten o'clock.

624
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:52,000
Twitter's quite addictive.

625
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:59,208
They're seeing me
push back from, you know...

626
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:03,542
In a reasonable way
for the first time.

627
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:07,709
"I don't agree with
what Chelsea Manning did.

628
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,834
There are appropriate channels
to go through.

629
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:11,959
Our national security
is important."

630
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:15,458
And I just...
I responded to that

631
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:19,000
and said, "Ever actually
try those channels?"

632
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,959
And that's it.

633
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,834
And, like, people
went nuts after that.

634
00:57:23,834 --> 00:57:25,041
So...

635
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,625

641
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:47,083
I was trans before
I started taking hormones.

642
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,500
I'm the same person as I was.

643
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,458
I just am presenting
myself differently.

644
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:05,208
People don't understand

645
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,291
how young the people are
who are in the military.

646
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,917
I'm uniquely situated
to have been the person

647
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:16,375
that probably interacted with
Chelsea face to face the most

648
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:19,333
over the last several years
now.

649
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:22,375
However many years it's been.
I don't even know.

650
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:26,083
And I have my own sense of
who she is as a person, right?

651
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,417
It doesn't always
line up and match

652
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:30,750
what the public perception
of Chelsea is.

653
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:38,041
And I think that she's aware

654
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:42,250
of that journey ahead of her.

655
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:46,333
And I think she also
recognizes that she can't...

656
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:47,500
You can't really dictate...

657
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,291
She can't dictate for herself

658
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:52,375
which path that's gonna go,
right?

659
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:55,000
Because she's been prevented
for the last ten years

660
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,375
of having the kinds of
experiences that we had

661
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:59,583
that helped shape us.

662
00:59:59,583 --> 01:00:03,000
And then that becomes
very overwhelming for people.

663
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,333
But particularly
for somebody like Chelsea,

664
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,458
who's still trying to be her.

665
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:10,041
You know, she's still
trying to be who she is.

666
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:14,375
So as she's finally able
to be who she is,

667
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:17,542
I just can't wait to see
what she turns into.

668
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,625
Ahh...

669
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,625
Mm...

670
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:44,583
You are now an icon
to many people

671
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:47,291
who believe that the government
needs to be more transparent,

672
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:49,083
not just in war but in general.

673
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,625
If someone,

674
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:52,083
let's say a young programmer,

675
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,667
comes to you

676
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:56,750
who wants to work for more
government transparency,

677
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,542
what would you suggest?

678
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:01,792
Make your own decisions,
make your own choices,

679
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:03,834
make your own judgment...

680
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:06,500
Are there specific things
that they could do

681
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,166
to further
that particular cause?

682
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:10,834
No. I mean,
you have to pay attention.

683
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,291
You have to pay attention.

684
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:16,542
How did the turmoil
that you were going through

685
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:20,417
in terms of thinking
about transitioning...

686
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:23,709
How did that affect
your disclosures later on...

687
01:01:23,709 --> 01:01:25,709
- I don't...
- ...as your attorney says?

688
01:01:25,709 --> 01:01:27,083
I don't think it did. You know,

689
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,375
it was this endless, straight,
like, you know, like...

690
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:32,125
They're not connected.

691
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:33,583
I don't think they're connected.

692
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,792
I see the, like, endless stream

693
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,875
of violence and death
and destruction

694
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:40,083
as being the primary motivator.

695
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,583
Okay.

696
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:45,291
Now, WikiLeaks, it's gone
a whole road since back then.

697
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:47,542
What did you know
about WikiLeaks in 2010?

698
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:49,750
What did you...
It was much more obscure.

699
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,709
Well, I mean...
Yeah, it was, it was.

700
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:53,750
I wasn't really a part of,
like, you know...

701
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,792
It was, like... I was, like...

702
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:57,917
I was running out of time
and decisions

703
01:01:57,917 --> 01:01:59,625
and they just had
the tools available.

704
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,458
They knew how to use them.
That was it.

705
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:02,917
That's all it boiled own to.

706
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,667
It's like, I...
I was running out of time.

707
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:07,250
- Because you had to go to Iraq.
- I had to go back to Iraq.

708
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,625
And, you know...

709
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:12,375
There was no way I was gonna
be able to upload it from Iraq.

710
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:15,500
You know, it's a policy of
newspapers to redact names

711
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,625
to protect the identities of
people who might be in danger

712
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:21,750
and the head of WikiLeaks,
Julian Assange,

713
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,375
believes in much more
complete transparency

714
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:27,333
and he believes that it would
contaminate the evidence,

715
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,583
to use his phrase,

716
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:30,250
if you did redact those names.

717
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,083
And so he did not,
in some cases,

718
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:37,500
which potentially
endangered informants,

719
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,208
particularly in Afghanistan.

720
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,250
We strongly dispute those facts.

721
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,375
Okay.

722
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,083
We strongly dispute those facts.

723
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:47,583
The government was not able
to show any indication of that.

724
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:49,625
- Yes, yes.
- Zero.

725
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:52,959
Did you not fear sending out
these things

726
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,750
that you didn't know
what was in them?

727
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,166
I did know. I worked
with this information every day.

728
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,208
Did you not fear
that it might hurt someone

729
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:01,458
- if you didn't know exactly...
- Absolutely not.

730
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,709
It was historical data.

731
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:04,500
There's no sources.
There's no methods.

732
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,125
There's no intelligence
information in here.

733
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,667
It's not there. It's people
dying and people getting killed

734
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:12,500
and people suffering

735
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,875
and on a massive,
incredible scale.

736
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:21,667
As a result... I'm going to
skip ahead a little bit...

737
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,041
It must be a difficult position

738
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:26,458
because you're an important
public figure for many people

739
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,083
and yet I can understand

740
01:03:28,083 --> 01:03:30,917
how you want to just get on
with a new life as well

741
01:03:30,917 --> 01:03:32,667
and these things
keep coming back.

742
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:34,667
How do you deal with that?

743
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:39,875
I don't know.

744
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,500
I haven't figured that out yet.

745
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:00,875
How did you survive
in solitary confinement?

746
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:09,500
I just remember, you know,
whenever I was in Kuwait,

747
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,667
that I died.

748
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
I was alive but I was dead.

749
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:20,583
And I've been dead ever since.

750
01:06:20,583 --> 01:06:22,583
Sort of...
If that makes any sense.

751
01:06:25,417 --> 01:06:28,667
Like, somehow I'm, like, in this
visceral, like, purgatory

752
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:32,709
between...the two.

753
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,875
And that time.

754
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,041
And then I wake up for a while.

755
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:42,834
I just want to forget
it ever happened.

756
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,166
I just want to not be reminded

757
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,083
that it ever
happened to me ever.

758
01:06:55,959 --> 01:06:58,959
I think that the moments
that I've enjoyed,

759
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:01,417
you know, in the years since,

760
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,208
have been whenever
I've completely forgotten.

761
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:22,041
People want me to relive it
and I can't.

762
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:31,834
I'm just trying
to find some closure

763
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:33,583
and some peace to all this.

764
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:39,041
I live in a state of,
you know, uncertainty

765
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:41,709
and I feel like
every step I take

766
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:44,583
is a step on thin ice.

767
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:46,208
I mean, I'm just, you know,

768
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:49,250
I'm just another one of us
that's scared.

769
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:52,083
You know. I just...
I find myself backed in a corner

770
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:53,750
and there's no other way to go

771
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,583
other than to fight back

772
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:59,125
and I'm certainly not going to
wait for somebody to save me.

773
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,750
Or save any of us.

774
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:08,250
I'm certainly not going to wait
for anybody to save any of us

775
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:12,458
because, chances are...
nobody's coming.

776
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,291
Go ahead.

777
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:30,166
These are not the people
that made our country great.

778
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:32,208
But we're gonna
make it great again.

779
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:37,291
These are the people that
are destroying our country.

administration's ban

783
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:45,417
was announced via Tweet.

784
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,750
What happens to transgender
service members now?

785
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,041
Are they immediately
thrown out of the military?

786
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:27,000
- Hey.

787
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,917
- How are ya?
- I'm doing okay.

788
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:32,917
I just wanted to check in 'cause
I know I've been super busy.

789
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:35,375
Yeah.
It's nice to hear your voice.

790
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,208
It's like
everything's just falling apart

791
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:39,250
and getting worse
and becoming a disaster again.

792
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:41,500
- Mm-hm.
- My safe is coming.

793
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,041
And my surveillance cameras
are... I have them installed.

794
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,709
I just need to wire them.

795
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:48,583
Good.
You do what needs to be done.

796
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:49,709
Yeah.

797
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,875
As soon as I started to see...

798
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:54,250
As soon as
Charlottesville happened,

799
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,542
I was, like, I need security.

800
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:06,125
For the last
six months, the alt-right,

801
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,291
they've been, like, mobilized,

802
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:13,333
and emboldened by the fact that,

803
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,250
you know,
they have an administration

804
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,458
that appears to be
favorable to them.

805
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:28,166
Can you explain
what we're doing?

806
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:34,166
For somebody
like me, like a trans person,

807
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:36,875
or somebody who's black
or brown in this country,

808
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:40,542
or Jewish in this country...
this is an existential threat.

809
01:10:40,542 --> 01:10:44,792
You know, today it might not be
an existential threat.

810
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:47,917
But five years from now, it's
an absolute existential threat.

811
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:56,333
We can be afraid to say
something sometimes.

812
01:10:56,333 --> 01:11:00,250
And I'm not as afraid any more
as I used to be

813
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,625
of saying the thing
that needs to be said.

814
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,917
What are they gonna do?

815
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:09,125
Throw me in prison?

816
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:11,959
Or kill me?

817
01:11:11,959 --> 01:11:14,125
They're gonna do that anyway.

818
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:17,417
If we let them, you know...

819
01:11:17,417 --> 01:11:21,542
If we let them take
the reins of our society.

820
01:11:21,542 --> 01:11:24,041
You know, like,
they're gonna do that anyway.

821
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:28,125

You are on the air.
Go ahead, please.

My question is,
so, Chelsea,

857
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,458
you had some suicide attempts
in prison.

858
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:33,458
For someone who's had
those kind of issues,

859
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,417
what makes you the candidate

860
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:37,750
to represent
the people of Maryland?

861
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,875
Are you suggesting
that someone

862
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,917
who has suffered
from clinical depression

863
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,792
is not qualified
to run for office?

864
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:44,834
No, that's not what
I'm suggesting.

865
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:45,917
Okay.

866
01:13:45,917 --> 01:13:48,041
He's asking, are you
mentally stable now

867
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:51,250
given all the horrific...?
I think that's what he's asking.

868
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,166
Given discussions
about the President

869
01:13:53,166 --> 01:13:55,500
and his mental stability,

870
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,375
I think that
should be something

871
01:13:57,375 --> 01:13:59,333
we ask about all candidates.

872
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:00,917
I strongly disagree.

873
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:03,291
You know, we shouldn't be
stigmatizing anybody

874
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,917
for any mental health issues.

875
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:06,458
You know. But um...

876
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:10,125
Like, I'm more than willing
to admit I'm in therapy.

877
01:14:10,125 --> 01:14:12,417
As a senator, would you release
confidential information

878
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,583
that was being held
by Senate panel?

879
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:18,250
No, but I would certainly move
to push for as much transparency

880
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,709
in government as possible.

881
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:22,709
You're challenging
the Democratic incumbent

882
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,166
in the primary.

883
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:26,542
Your platform includes
closing prisons,

884
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:28,917
free college,
universal healthcare...

885
01:14:33,834 --> 01:14:36,166
Hi, I'm Chelsea Manning.
I'm running for US Senate.

886
01:14:36,166 --> 01:14:38,333
And I get asked this a lot
by reporters, you know.

887
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:40,417
"Why are you running
for Senate?"

888
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:43,583
If you look around and you look
at everything that's going on,

889
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,458
whether it's
the immigration debate,

890
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:48,792
healthcare or police,
police brutality,

891
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:50,166
and mass surveillance...

892
01:14:50,166 --> 01:14:52,417
Like, why the hell
wouldn't I be running?

893
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,041
You know, in this environment,

894
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:57,000
in this toxic environment
that we live in,

895
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,709
where's our say?

896
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:07,625
We're just trying
to excite people.

897
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:09,083
And... And...

898
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:11,041
Yeah, we know
it's an uphill battle.

899
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:13,291
We know...

900
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:16,458
words like "Cinderella story",

901
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:18,959
"long shot", "underdog",

902
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:20,917
words like that
are going to be applied.

903
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:23,417
Is it stressful? Oh, yeah.

904
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:25,542
This is very stressful.

905
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:29,542
But we also know that

906
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:31,375
at the end of it all

907
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:34,417
we're going to be
so happy that we tried.

908
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:36,625
Changing the world isn't easy.

909
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:39,291
It's not. I mean...

910
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,458
Chelsea knows.

911
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:12,917
If you're
an intelligence analyst,

912
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:15,500
you really have to
understand your opponent.

913
01:16:17,542 --> 01:16:19,750
And you have to think
like your opponent.

914
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:24,291
A certain amount of empathy
is a requirement

915
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:26,250
to being effective.

916
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:38,417
Whenever I've protested

917
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:40,834
against the alt-right,

918
01:16:40,834 --> 01:16:43,625
I realized
that Cassandra Fairbanks

919
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:45,208
was there.

920
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:48,125
She was a supporter
in my campaign

921
01:16:48,125 --> 01:16:50,000
to get me out of prison.

922
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:57,458
I decided to use
that connection

923
01:16:57,458 --> 01:17:00,250
to try to see what information
we could glean

924
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,667
from that particular
flavor of the alt-right.

925
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:09,000
It's called rapport-building
in intelligence work.

926
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:14,500
I didn't really know what the
fuck I was getting myself into.

927
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:19,500
I finally hit the jackpot.

928
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:23,417
She invited me to an event.

929
01:17:23,417 --> 01:17:27,417
All of alt-right Twitter
in the same fucking room.

930
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:31,208
USA! USA!

931
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:34,333
Manning...

932
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,375
We're never coming down.

933
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:38,291
We took America back.

934
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,291
America's ours now.

935
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:41,709
We're never coming down.

936
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:43,458
- Never!
- Never!

937
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,166
- Never coming down.

938
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:47,166
- We're never coming down.
- We're coming to get you

939
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:48,500
if you try and take
our firearms!

940
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,709
America's back!

941
01:17:49,709 --> 01:17:52,333
- That's what's up!
- You piece of filth!

942
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:56,375
Everybody keeps
getting mad at me.

943
01:18:56,375 --> 01:18:58,542
Every time I open my phone,
people are mad at me.

944
01:18:58,542 --> 01:19:01,250
Every time they fucking talk
to me, I have to break shit up.

945
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,542
They're fucking...

946
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:05,583
And guess what, they're gonna
counter-attack for months, okay?

947
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:06,750
Every time we do something,

948
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,250
they're going to
fucking respond.

949
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:09,417
- Shh.
- We're not going to.

950
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:10,834
Chelsea, I'm not mad.

951
01:19:10,834 --> 01:19:12,917
- I'm not mad.
- Yeah, you are.

952
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:15,208
You might not think you're mad
but you're mad.

953
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,458
Do you realize, this is like
a scene in the movie

954
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:19,000
when all the good guys realize

955
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,834
that the enemies are
manipulating them

956
01:19:20,834 --> 01:19:22,375
and dividing them
against each other.

957
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:23,959
We are a roomful of allies.

958
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,625
We're all on the same team
in here and we're fighting.

959
01:19:34,166 --> 01:19:36,625
- This is old fucking news.
- Okay.

960
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:40,125
Seven days old now.

961
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:42,875
I'm tired of fucking
hearing about this.

962
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,417
I am too. We all are.

963
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:47,959
This is driving us
into the fucking ground.

964
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,625
We've said so much
to your supporters,

965
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,291
so much to people
who were upset.

966
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:55,125
We can't say any more
to smooth it over.

967
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:57,208
Nothing we say
will change anyone's minds.

968
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:59,834
No matter what we do,
people's minds are set.

969
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:09,875
This week was fucking traumatic.

970
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,917
And I am over it.
I'm so over it.

971
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:13,667
You don't fucking...

972
01:20:13,667 --> 01:20:15,917
You don't do that.
You don't play their game.

973
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:17,875
Yeah, don't play their game.
Thank you.

974
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:21,667
I messed this up.

975
01:20:24,041 --> 01:20:26,000
♪ brooding violin music ♪

976
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:06,917
I knew I'd fucked up.

977
01:21:06,917 --> 01:21:10,875
I immediately knew
that it was indefensible.

978
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,458
It was wrong.

979
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:35,917
I don't know what people
are expecting out of me.

980
01:21:35,917 --> 01:21:38,542
I mean, I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

981
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:40,500
I just got out of prison.

982
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:46,750
You know. And here we are.

983
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,834
We're right next to Quantico,
by the way.

984
01:21:48,834 --> 01:21:50,625
Where we are.

985
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:52,709
So... About a mile and a half

986
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:55,583
from where I was held
in solitary confinement.

987
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:16,458
I was never gonna be a...
a mouthpiece.

988
01:22:19,959 --> 01:22:22,125
I'm not a hero.

989
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:29,792
I'm just somebody who...

990
01:22:32,417 --> 01:22:34,792
...you know...

991
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,959
I've always been somebody

992
01:22:36,959 --> 01:22:39,291
willing to, like, jump in
and do something.

993
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:47,667
I've spoken through
other family members to her

994
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,709
but it's very difficult
to reach her.

995
01:22:56,834 --> 01:22:59,083
You know, and she's not well.

996
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:03,000
She had a stroke. Yeah.

997
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,208
I try to not get them involved

998
01:23:07,208 --> 01:23:09,417
in all the craziness
that happens around me.

999
01:23:13,625 --> 01:23:16,667
I heard from my father but...
we don't talk much.

1000
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:24,583
Our...

1001
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,083
Our positions on life
are so divergent

1002
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,709
that I don't know
if we can reconcile.

1003
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:35,959
I don't know
if we can reconcile.

1004
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:41,917
He cared less
about me being gay.

1005
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:47,291
I think he's kind of in denial
about my trans-ness.

1006
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:52,125
I think...

1007
01:23:54,792 --> 01:23:56,583
I think...

1008
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:02,709
I think he doesn't know
who I am.

1009
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:12,959
Suspicions undoubtedly
have been raised

1010
01:25:12,959 --> 01:25:15,792
that this happened
to Chelsea Manning.

1011
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:17,542
The police raid her home
with guns drawn

1012
01:25:17,542 --> 01:25:19,500
in this so-called
"Wellness Check".

1013
01:25:20,792 --> 01:25:22,625
She's a candidate
for the US Senate

1014
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:24,208
who is known
for participating

1015
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,166
in political protests.

1016
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:59,000
Come on, Janice.

1017
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:05,166
Hey,
I have the final statement

1018
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:07,333
if you want me to read it.

1019
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,667
Uh-huh.

1020
01:26:09,959 --> 01:26:12,417
"Last year, when I was
released from prison,

1021
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,041
I emerged into a world
of hate and injustice.

1022
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,291
I wondered if I should spend

1023
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:20,041
my first year of freedom
recovering.

1024
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:23,875
But I couldn't sit still.

1025
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,250
I tried to use my platform
as a public figure

1026
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:27,625
to send a message.

1027
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:29,625
Every one of us has power.

1028
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:33,542
Over the past several months
it has become clear

1029
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:36,208
that my experiences
have taken an enormous toll

1030
01:26:36,208 --> 01:26:38,375
on my physical
and emotional health.

1031
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:41,750
I stepped back
from campaigning

1032
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,750
to prioritize
my own well-being.

1033
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:48,875
I found the space and
the treatment I need to heal.

1034
01:26:49,917 --> 01:26:51,375
I'm not giving up.

1035
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:53,792
I'm grateful for everyone
who believes in me.

1036
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,208
Together we got this."

1037
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:59,500
- Does that sound good?

1038
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:04,000
Chelsea?

1039
01:27:20,917 --> 01:27:23,667
It's harder
to do the right thing

1040
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:26,583
than it is
to go within the process.

1041
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:31,792
And so I think everybody
has to make their own call

1042
01:27:31,792 --> 01:27:33,834
as to what they're willing
to do.

1043
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:42,792
Being trans,
being queer as a kid...

1044
01:27:45,458 --> 01:27:47,041
...being unwanted

1045
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:48,917
and being unloved...

1046
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:52,125
being not cared about...

1047
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,542
...I've always felt
a close connection

1048
01:27:56,542 --> 01:27:59,792
with the people
who are hurting the most.

1049
01:28:02,166 --> 01:28:03,750
If I wasn't exposed to that,

1050
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,959
maybe I could ignore it
or not see it.

1051
01:28:05,959 --> 01:28:07,542
But I can't.

1052
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,542
I think Chelsea
will always be

1053
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:46,417
looking over her shoulder...

In this country,
once you've been marked

1057
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:57,500
as an enemy of the state,

1058
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,291
I think you'll always be
an enemy of the state

1059
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:02,375
and you'll always have to worry

1060
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:05,083

some other reason.

1061

1065
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:34,125
in an investigation
into WikiLeaks.

1066
01:29:34,125 --> 01:29:37,041
Manning can be held
for a maximum of 18 months

1067
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,583

As everybody knows,
Chelsea has tremendous courage.

Julian Assange's
arrest in London on Thursday,

under a warrant from the
United States for extradition.

a government computer

to Chelsea Manning.

1078
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:14,750

up? Do you have any idea?

I'm worried and I think other

about the...

that they're holding her
in solitary.

1084
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:32,625
The grand jury can go for what?
About 18 months.

1085
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:34,542
And then they can start
all over again.

1086
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:37,125
- They could.
- They can go forever.

1087
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:39,542
She's gonna have to
do something to...

1088
