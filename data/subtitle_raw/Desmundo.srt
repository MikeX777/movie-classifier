1
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,345
Come on!
Lower it.

2
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,716
Let it down!
Come on!

3
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:53,697
BRAZIL
AROUND 1570

4
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:02,672
Keep your head down.
The sun will burn your skin.

5
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:19,460
I've written Your Highness about
the lack of women in this land...

6
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,201
to marry the men, so...

7
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,467
they can live to serve Our Lord apart
from the sinful life they live now.

8
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,642
Send as many orphans as possible,
and if you can't find as many...

9
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,769
send us women of any kind...

10
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,239
since here,
white women are so rare...

11
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,983
that any kind of them
will be good for the land...

12
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,679
and for the men.

13
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,540
I don't read very well.
I'll give it to the abbot.

14
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,489
I see no women here.

15
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,226
Maybe there isn't any.

16
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,297
It can't be true.
Who would bear the children?

17
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,962
Men, if it's God's wish.

18
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,327
-And how'd men deliver them?
-Through the armpits.

19
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,531
Boys through the right,
and girls through the left.

20
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,769
Silence!

21
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,407
-Are they healthy?
-Yes, thank God.

22
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,417
The boys are in the church.

23
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,763
It says here you were a nun,

24
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,598
but you've laid down with a man.

25
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,466
They took my child from me. That
was the worst punishment of all.

26
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,648
Maria, come wash yourself!

27
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,616
Old women wash only their face.

28
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,727
Where are my flowers?

29
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,524
Where are they?

30
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,462
They are so beautiful.

31
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,037
They are so beautiful!

32
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,375
I will not allow them to marry.

33
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,516
I want them all for me.

34
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,287
It will be very nice.

35
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,398
We'll go to the mass.

36
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,526
We'll embroider.

37
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,531
The church is almost ready.

38
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,707
Smile, girl...

39
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,783
Like this.
Like this!

40
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,417
Strong, good...

41
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,981
Good!

42
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,696
What's wrong with you?

43
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,823
Why are you upset?

44
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,536
Lady Oribela is sensitive to heat.

45
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:55,064
She'll get use to it.
I'm sure she will!

46
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:59,304
She came from a convent.
She is very religious.

47
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,849
If you could find her
a devotee husband...

48
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:07,582
A devotee husband? There are
no devotee men in this land.

49
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,421
Don't worry.

50
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:17,126
Married life is easy.

51
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,128
You just have to live
by the men's rules.

52
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,905
Never show too much trust,
or there will be distrust.

53
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,731
Never bite your lips,
that means anger.

54
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,347
In the end, the first to lie down...

55
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,338
will be the first to die.

56
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,619
Enough!

57
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,590
I'm praying.

58
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,944
Ask the father to send me
back to the convent!

59
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,976
For God's sake!

60
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,781
How can I help you if I can
hardly help myself?.

61
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,087
Satan tempts us...

62
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,585
to believe that we have virtues
that we don't have.

63
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,983
Go to bed!

64
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,179
Silence!

65
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:20,944
Are these the Tupinambás...
who've captured the white men?

66
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,179
My poor husband!

67
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,490
It's so hard for him
to control these people!

68
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,172
Come! Come!

69
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,950
Out of the way!

70
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,290
Silence!

71
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,885
Silence!

72
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,629
Tell him to bring
the white prisoners.

73
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,335
If they are French,
they can keep them.

74
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,647
What did he say?

75
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,920
''We'll kill the white men.

76
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,629
Since the white men arrived...

77
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,826
we haven't eaten
half of our prisoners.''

78
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,294
Forget the Indians,
call the orphans.

79
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:54,537
Take the Indians
and wait outside.

80
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,239
There will be trouble.

81
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,881
We'd be better off if the king send
us weapons for our defense.

82
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,185
The orphans!

83
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,490
Let's see these beauties.

84
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,433
I prefer the savages!

85
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,477
-I'd like to take one of them.
-You'rejust a poor man.

86
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,377
Cristóvão, the widowed!

87
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,244
Approach, Mr. Cristóvão Borralho!

88
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,026
Lady Tareja de Sande.

89
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,778
Thank you, sir.

90
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,016
Lady Giralda Teixeira.

91
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,666
I brought it...
for you.

92
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,846
Thank you.

93
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,421
Dom Alfonso!

94
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,887
Dom Alfonso Soares D'Aragão!

95
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,838
Lady Oribela de Covilhã.

96
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,058
So, father...

97
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,123
didn't they come from the convent?

98
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,332
Out of here!
Take this girl out of here!

99
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,631
Seven...

100
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,568
eight...

101
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,914
Just like a chicken, you want
to fly and you can't.

102
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,945
You are a fool.

103
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,484
Nine...
You're hurting me!

104
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,391
Be quiet!
Keep your misery for yourself.

105
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,628
Ten!

106
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,071
Look!

107
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,149
Not even a drunkard will take you.

108
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,288
Maybe they'll send me back.

109
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,625
All these girls...

110
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,561
are welcome here.

111
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,462
And thank God...

112
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,400
they made a safe trip.

113
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,502
Women, give the hand
to the grooms.

114
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,074
The spouses will rule over...

115
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:03,250
their wives and daughters.

116
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,091
But, shall not live in lust.

117
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,861
Do never lie down...

118
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,027
with your mothers...

119
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,762
or your daughters.

120
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,900
Do not behave like the Indians...

121
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,307
the natives...

122
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,576
the Brasis,
who live like savages.

123
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:36,815
May you be blessed by
the Holy Matrimony...

124
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,061
and may your children be blessed...

125
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,095
with white skin.

126
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,152
Who are you?

127
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,728
Francisco de Albuquerque.

128
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,200
Thank you,
lady Oribela...

129
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,739
for coming from so far
to marry me.

130
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,813
I'd like to offer you
a real bed, but...

131
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,350
-there's no lodging house here.
-Where are my belongings?

132
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,288
With the load I'm taking
to the mill.

133
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,236
Do you want to pray?

134
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:39,140
I want to sleep.
I'm tired from the trip.

135
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,379
Lie down, then.

136
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,980
I don't know you, sir!
Don't force me!

137
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,503
I'm your husband!

138
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,597
I'm your husband!

139
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,548
I need time to know you,

140
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,941
to learn to like you.

141
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,480
I'll accept you, but be patient.

142
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,320
I can wait some time...

143
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,052
for you to be acquainted with me.

144
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,217
Sir!

145
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,158
Sir!

146
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,992
Where are we going to?
I don't see the ocean.

147
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,633
Shut up!
We're almost there.

148
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,582
Lady Oribela,
this is my mother.

149
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,093
Are you hungry?

150
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,525
You really don't want to eat?

151
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,223
No.

152
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,913
Where does she come from?

153
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,808
Covilhã.

154
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,315
And the dowry?

155
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,162
Two cows.

156
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,102
Couldn't you choose another one?

157
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,238
Fatter? With larger hips?

158
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,379
I liked this one.

159
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:57,847
Lady Oribela.

160
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,824
Your blessing.

161
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,229
It took you long to wake up.
It's late.

162
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,569
Did you sleep well?

163
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,541
Yes.

164
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,511
The heat bothered you?

165
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,609
-No.
-Really?

166
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,613
I got used to it
during the trip.

167
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,523
Do you have sleeping clothes?

168
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,023
I've never changed
my clothes to sleep.

169
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,745
Sit down, lady Oribela.

170
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,009
You're very welcome
in this house.

171
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,621
Francisco is a very good son.

172
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,357
He's renounced many good women.

173
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,095
He has always cared for me.

174
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,063
-Good morning, lady Oribela.
-Good morning.

175
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,894
Come with me.

176
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,173
Get on it.

177
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,962
Lady Brites said your father
was a dealer,

178
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,821
that you came from Covilhã.

179
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,301
You better get used to this life.

180
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,050
You were offered as remainder.

181
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,112
As someone nobody wanted.

182
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,147
I'm not some leftover.

183
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,423
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

184
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,890
Forget about what's out here.
You'll stay in the house.

185
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,835
I'II send for furniture and
cloths for you.

186
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,399
I can hear you breathing.

187
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,009
Can't you sleep?

188
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,901
The air is healthy here.

189
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,676
Are you healthy?

190
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,275
I'm not very healthy.

191
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,390
Why lady Branca got upset
when I looked at the child?

192
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,590
Viliganda is my sister.

193
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,795
She is ashamed
of the girl's disorder.

194
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,772
Ximeno Dias!

195
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,402
Francisco!

196
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,156
I've traveled for two days only...

197
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,322
and my legs already hurt.

198
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:03,939
Carajás?

199
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:05,947
Guarus.

200
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,811
Not many.

201
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,478
It's been hard to deal with them.

202
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,052
They don't want utensils anymore.

203
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,027
They rather eat them
than sell.

204
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,400
They don't want utensils
but they do know gunpowder.

205
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,759
Everybody understands
that word.

206
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,768
I brought it from Açores.

207
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,174
I won.

208
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,705
Oribela...

209
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,477
-Yes, sir.
-Come here.

210
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,271
Pick something.
Do you embroider?

211
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,839
Choose anything.

212
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,769
I want these.

213
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,759
These used to be worth
two or tree men.

214
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,356
Now they don't want anything.
They don't trust anyone.

215
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,903
May I go, sir?

216
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,780
How much?

217
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,278
I didn't do anything!

218
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:41,026
-He laughed at my misfortune!
-He is a Marrano!

219
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,893
A New-Christian.

220
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,964
-I did nothing.
-A Jew!

221
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,429
I did nothing.

222
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,903
Despicable...
false Christian!

223
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,940
Look what I found!

224
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,283
Sir, take me on board.

225
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,061
Let me go!
Let me go!

226
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,938
For God's sake!

227
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,374
-Give her to me!
-Let me go!

228
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:53,309
-I found her!
-How much do you have?

229
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,143
-Let me down!
-Get away!

230
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,811
Let me go!

231
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:01,148
For God's sake!
Take me back.

232
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,055
-How much do you have?
-What?

233
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,359
Money.

234
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,661
I have no money.
I'm desperate.

235
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,458
There's nothing in here!

236
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,598
Pedro is desperate too.

237
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,194
I beg you!

238
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,034
Little whore.

239
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,174
I'm the wife of...

240
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,094
Look! Look!

241
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,634
You stole my boots.

242
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:39,143
God will punish us
with anger.

243
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,282
Francisco, forgive me.

244
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,927
I'll never do that again.

245
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:05,844
What?

246
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,529
Get me out of here!

247
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,201
Let me out!

248
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,307
I'm not an animal!

249
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,908
I'm not a hunted beast!

250
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,450
You coward! You shit!

251
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,690
You damned!
Beelzebub!

252
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,150
Go!

253
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,298
You've really upseted me.

254
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,409
If I was a cruel man,
I'd never let you stay here.

255
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:23,075
I'd whip you with a hog's
leather lash...

256
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,572
in the village.

257
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:08,285
Don't be fool trying
to escape from me.

258
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,867
-I'll never run away again.
-If you do...

259
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:23,064
I'll kill you.

260
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,944
They're all yours.

261
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,978
Good afternoon, Francisco.

262
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,660
Have you been in the woods?

263
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,693
Good afternoon, father.

264
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:48,912
If they were only nine or ten...
But there are many more.

265
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,680
There are many, but I need...

266
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,282
each one of them to work.

267
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,374
Your blessing, father.

268
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,450
You should have called me.

269
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,655
The Brasis need to be catechized.

270
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,714
-We were going to.
-Sit down, father.

271
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:04,127
We'll start to build the chapel.

272
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,685
It's about time.

273
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:09,159
They're Christians.
They can sit with us.

274
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,927
How do you say?

275
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,942
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

276
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,068
Not here.

277
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,368
Father...

278
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:27,444
Ximeno was here selling natives.
We didn't buy them.

279
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,285
We are building a school.

280
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,322
Your blessing, father.

281
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:40,493
Good evening, lady Maria.

282
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,834
I'll take some with me to be
raised like Christians.

283
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:45,769
Some of what?

284
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,871
Some of your new Indians.

285
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,533
Father, would you like to eat?

286
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:56,434
That's right, father, get some rest.
It's a long trip.

287
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,444
Tomorrow we'll talk
about natives.

288
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,753
I'll take some of them.

289
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:07,190
We teach the children and
then they teach their parents.

290
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,523
But not many.
Two or three of the small ones.

291
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:29,469
My dear!

292
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:30,971
I'm sorry.

293
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,306
I didn't mean to wake you up.

294
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,350
Come.

295
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,623
Do you want to lie down
with me?

296
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,759
I have to go.
Francisco may wake up.

297
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,691
Go and get an older one.

298
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,702
I wanted so much to talk to you.

299
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,905
It wasn't easy for me to come.

300
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,847
I need an older one to fish.

301
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:45,814
Bring the animals.
It's time to go.

302
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,325
Bring the animals.

303
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,594
Navarro, take the boy back.

304
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:57,033
I offered you a bride and
2 cows as dowry...

305
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,466
and you deny me an Indian?

306
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,800
This one is old enough to work.

307
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,041
-What do you mean?
-Father, for God's sake!

308
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,070
If you want savages,
go get them!

309
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,181
These ones are mine!

310
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:15,241
Francisco, this is a disgrace for us!

311
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,180
You'll pay for this.

312
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:20,350
You'll pay a lot for this!

313
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,951
Come, Maria!

314
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,825
-Why do they argue?
-For no good reason.

315
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,686
They should cut the Indians in half.

316
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,359
Each Indian you deny me,
nearer you are of your damnation.

317
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:37,032
Your husband has a bad reputation.

318
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:43,368
You talk too much!
Go help!

319
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:58,092
Don't think you can escape
from the law hiding yourself here!

320
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,621
Go inside.

321
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,497
Greed and cruelty,
nice match!

322
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:08,494
The kingdom is close,
closer than you imagine.

323
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,599
You'll pay for your sins.

324
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:50,703
Who do you think you are?
Have you lost your mind?

325
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,409
Affronting the father like that!

326
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:56,945
Stupid!

327
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:00,883
-I care for my belongings.
-Your head belongs to you!

328
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:04,860
I want more than that.

329
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:09,362
We're not absolute,
we have nothing.

330
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,259
This is a great land.

331
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:16,365
If they bother me,
I'll go further into the woods.

332
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,205
What do you intend to do?

333
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,436
Become a savage?

334
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,443
Francisco...

335
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,263
Do you like the chest?

336
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,297
Yes.

337
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,782
I could buy you another one...

338
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:06,917
with the natives the father took.

339
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,880
One is enough.

340
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,628
I'll give you a veil
to pray in church.

341
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,706
The church is too far.

342
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:40,951
Long ago...

343
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,720
I wanted to go into the woods...

344
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,958
after the treasures...

345
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,927
there are beyond the forests.

346
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,678
But that wasjust a dream.

347
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,812
Have you seen a ghost?

348
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,410
No.

349
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,380
Is it because of the girl?

350
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,085
Forgive me.

351
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:19,682
For what?

352
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,492
Were you imagining things?

353
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,288
You think you know everything.

354
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,565
But what do you know?

355
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,334
-What do you know about life?
-Nothing.

356
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,172
I left Portugal 15 years ago.

357
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,641
Alone. By myself...

358
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,344
with my son.

359
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,510
There were no houses here...

360
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,548
no beds.

361
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,617
We slept on the floor.

362
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,650
Nobody is innocent...

363
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,491
especially you.

364
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:10,623
My name is Antonio.

365
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,918
My name is Paulo.

366
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,988
My name is Paulo.

367
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,540
I'm Paulo.

368
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,109
My name is Paulo.

369
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:13,849
Ximeno Dias!

370
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,536
I'm Antonio.
I arrived from south today.

371
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,400
I heard you're a dealer.

372
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,807
I want leave on
the next ship.

373
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,885
-If it's not enough...
-I don't deal with that.

374
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,088
Don't worry...

375
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,426
you'll be well paid.

376
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,059
-I can't help you.
-For God's sake.

377
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:57,462
I'm sorry.

378
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:01,532
Mr. Ximeno,
just one day!

379
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:07,841
Get rid of that mule.
People know who owns it.

380
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,237
I want to talk to Ximeno Dias.

381
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:19,876
Where is he?

382
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,085
She's been here for too long?

383
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:06,424
-Was she riding a horse?
-I didn't see.

384
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:10,722
Go.

385
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,596
For God's sake!

386
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:20,903
I need a place to stay for a while.

387
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,510
Just until the ship arrives.

388
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,648
Your husband is in the village.

389
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,878
I have two gold coins.

390
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,014
-Go back to him.
-I couldn't even if I wanted to.

391
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:33,848
And I don't want to.
I need you.

392
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,484
Go or I'll kick you out!

393
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,556
It's all yours.
Whatever you want.

394
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:46,727
Take! Nobody will ever
hear from me again.

395
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:48,797
Francisco is outside
asking for you.

396
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,439
Be merciful!

397
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,441
Go to the port.

398
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,464
-How can I help you?
-Somebody stole my animals.

399
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:21,269
-Cows?
-Mounting mules.

400
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,063
Do you think they'd come here?

401
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:27,769
Maybe they went into the woods.

402
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,236
I'm not after the mules.

403
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,477
I'm after the thief.

404
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,651
I can get you some mules.

405
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,812
Don't you understand me, Marrano?

406
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,355
-Weren't you going to Açores?
-I'm thinking about.

407
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,188
There is time before
the next ship.

408
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:59,038
Maybe I'll stay in the village
for a few days.

409
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,905
Maybe...

410
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:05,846
I'll recover what they've stolen me.

411
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,408
-Do you plan to go to the woods?
-Maybe, in a few days.

412
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,549
If you do, let me know.

413
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:17,421
I may need you.

414
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,723
Order you some things.

415
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,288
What did you say?

416
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,921
Don't walk. Don't talk.
Don't make any noise.

417
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,724
Stay here...

418
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:32,261
and don't touch anything
or I'll kill you!

419
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,344
Where did you get those clothes?

420
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:52,950
From Francisco.

421
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,892
This moistness makes me crazy.

422
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:05,576
Bring me a basin.

423
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,492
Why did you run away?
Who was your father?

424
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,194
I'm not one of yours.

425
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,168
What's a New-Christian?

426
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,565
It's nothing.

427
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:36,481
When I get back to Portugal, I'll
ask for shelter in the convent...

428
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,509
in the house of the orphans.

429
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,887
I have faith...

430
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,363
I'll serve some madam.

431
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,107
Servants also live in confinement.

432
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,911
They're not allowed to go out.

433
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,289
Your beard...

434
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,495
has grown longer.

435
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,523
I'll bring some water.

436
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,999
Are you taking me?

437
01:18:35,143 --> 01:18:37,077
I'll bring you some water.

438
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,477
What are you doing here?

439
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:15,613
Good afternoon, father.
I want to talk to Maria.

440
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,281
What about?

441
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:21,280
I want to ask her something.

442
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,389
It won't take long.

443
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,331
If you had any honor, you
wouldn't be here asking anything.

444
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,320
Father...

445
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:34,692
You're arrogant! Vain!
Proud!

446
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,039
If I knew what
a low character you were,

447
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,064
I'd never give you a wife.

448
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,744
You'd be praying with the Brasis,

449
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,336
who are not so savage as you.

450
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,270
I know, father.

451
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,616
No, you don't.

452
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,651
Let me talk to Maria.

453
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:13,599
Be brief, Francisco.

454
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:23,349
I want to talk about Oribela.

455
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:26,585
If your wife needs her, forget it.

456
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,614
She's in seclusion.

457
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:32,621
My wife... ran away.

458
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,376
Where is the ship?

459
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:03,355
There are three villages
south from here.

460
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:13,971
Two of them are Portuguese.
The third one is Spanish.

461
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:28,581
There won't be any ship
for the next 3 months.

462
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:32,723
I can't hide you for so long.

463
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,157
Are you coming too?

464
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:37,987
No.

465
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:52,838
You prefer the savages.

466
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:06,049
There are too many Holy
hangings in Portugal.

467
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:39,584
It's a Spanish city.

468
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,162
People are happier.

469
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:47,258
Stay with me until
the ship arrives.

470
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:51,868
I'll stay a few days.

471
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:17,955
Follow me.

472
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,490
Don't make me shoot.

473
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,957
Go away!

474
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:31,199
Francisco, for God's sake!

475
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,598
I just want what's mine.

476
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:37,338
I'm not going to kill you,
or him!

477
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:38,828
Let her go!

478
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,629
Come!

479
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:44,706
Let's go.

480
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:48,507
-Let's go home.
-I'm not coming with you!

481
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,584
We are tied to each other.

482
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:55,248
Tied by chains.

483
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,054
Go away!
Disappear!

484
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:13,830
For God's sake, Francisco!

485
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:20,179
I will not punish you!

486
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:24,051
Go away! Just go!

487
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:25,609
Out of the way!

488
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,522
Don't make me shoot!

489
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:29,285
For God's sake!

490
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:36,323
Go away! Go away!

491
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,532
Come on! Out of the way!

492
01:32:58,506 --> 01:32:59,666
Let's go!

493
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,377
To my mother Fanny and my aunt
Fernanda, New-Christians...

494
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:44,718
Late baptized at the ages of 15 and 1 3.
And in memory of the superior mother...

495
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:47,220
from the convent of St. Chamond, France,
who has saved their lives in 1942.
