1
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:39,099
Once upon a time, there was a girl
who lived in a small town.

2
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,185
She had friends.

3
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,190
A boy who loved her.

4
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,361
But she had secrets.

5
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,448
And she wasn't free.

6
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,189
You want something to eat?

7
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,941
I'm not really hungry.

8
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,863
I have just the thing for you.

9
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,038
Works for me every time.

10
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,590
I forgot earlier.

11
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,383
I had to get another credit card.

12
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,220
-I got you one.
-Thanks.

13
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:07,247
So, yeah, who are you?

14
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,543
My name is Lindsay, aka Lady Bug, aka...

15
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,171
Some call me Bug, some call me Lady B.

16
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,714
What's pure happiness?

17
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,597
Pure happiness to me is

18
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,682
in the eye of the beholder.

19
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,186
I mean, only you can make yourself happy.

20
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:39,947
Motherfucker...

21
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,840
That's mine.

22
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,301
Get the fuck off.
Get the fuck off my hair, bro.

23
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,679
You disrespectful little shit!

24
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,433
Hey, man. What's your name?

25
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,394
Marcus.

26
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,660
I'm Trey.

27
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,664
Well, I don't really know
who I am at the moment.

28
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,292
-I know who you are.
-Who am I?

29
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,169
-You're my guy, bro.
-You're my guy, too.

30
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,296
I won't forget you, bro.

31
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,682
I can find happiness
in the smallest things,

32
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,100
or the biggest.

33
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,259
Hey, Mom.

34
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,514
Where are you getting all that money from?

35
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,393
I'm working. Just trying to save up.

36
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,188
Well, where you been working?
Where they paying you that kind of dough?

37
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,731
I'm just working, Mama.

38
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,693
You're just going
to keep it all to yourself

39
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,362
and you're not going to give none
to your poor mother?

40
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,864
You're fucked up, Mom.

41
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,243
I ain't know I raised such
a selfish bitch. Come on. Give it here.

42
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,536
Mom, stop!

43
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,706
If you ain't gonna share,

44
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,000
then you're gonna have to
get the hell out of my house.

45
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,796
Fine.

46
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,423
Well, then go on.

47
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,484
When do you feel most free?

48
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,946
When do I feel most free?

49
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,366
I feel most free...

50
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,704
probably when I'm laughing.

51
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,333
'Cause laughing is uncontrollable.

52
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,335
And, with my homies, I'm always laughing.

53
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,340
There's not much to do in this small town.

54
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,550
So, I'm like, it's either I laugh

55
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,595
or get high, or party.

56
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,983
So macho, T. Damn.

57
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,281
Bug!

58
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,368
Guys, who is all in there?

59
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,162
-Okay. Okay.
-Let's do this shit.

60
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,248
-Get your ass up in the car.
-Let's go, Captain.

61
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,753
What's up, Bug?
Are we late picking you up?

62
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,421
You know it.

63
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,464
What are we about to do, y'all?

64
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,590
We're about to smoke.

65
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,718
-Yeah.
-Thatâ€™s what we about to do.

66
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,887
-I already knew. I already knew.
-You already knew.

67
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:14,972
Look at that.

68
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,223
-Look at that glow.
-Oh, man. Come over here.

69
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,059
-That light!
-Right. That glow.

70
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,352
That is everything, bitch.
Get up in there.

71
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:21,895
That glow.

72
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,856
What's up with your mom?

73
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,025
You guys know, right? She wallin', always.

74
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,959
Nobody gives me hugs, though.

75
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,419
-Hey.
-Hey.

76
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,421
-Good to see you.
-How you doing?

77
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,507
Aren't you looking fresh as fuck?

78
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,056
It feels fancy to me.

79
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,184
-That's bougie.
-She's classy.

80
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,688
It's us in this fucking town.

81
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,190
I dare you to howl.

82
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,526
Shit's fire.

83
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,695
-Where'd you get that even?
-At thrift.

84
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,530
-You thrift?
-Yes.

85
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,199
If I had a son, yo...

86
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,701
Brother, obviously
just fucking rose up...

87
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,870
Oh, my fucking God.

88
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,038
You're saying it doesn't...

89
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,958
Both including Munich and chocolate malt.

90
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,461
Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,880
-Hey.
-Hey.

92
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,715
You good?

93
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,467
Yeah. Of course.

94
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,136
Then why're you over here like a creep?

95
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,227
Pure happiness.

96
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:48,482
You got these questions written down?
This is fucking...

97
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,027
Pure happiness.

98
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,699
Just doing my own thing.
Thinking about the void.

99
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,284
"The void," what's that?

100
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,956
What have we been doing? You know,
we used to have a purpose.

101
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,668
You would wake up, go to school,
come home, go to bed,

102
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,336
and it's all for something.

103
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,797
You know, what the fuck
have we been doing now?

104
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,592
Absolutely fucking nothing. You know,
we're fucking here every single week.

105
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,888
You know, I wish we could just

106
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,100
get in the fucking car
and drive the fuck out of here, you know?

107
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,018
Start a whole new thing.

108
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,229
Bah.

109
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,690
You said, "Bah."

110
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,693
-Bah...
-Let's just fucking go.

111
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,070
We've seen the same shit our whole lives.

112
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,947
-I wish...
-Let's just fucking go.

113
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,991
-I'm serious.
-"Let's fucking go."

114
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,117
I'm serious.

115
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,619
Powerful. There's a lot of power
behind this fucking man.

116
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,663
-Let me see this real quick.
-All right. You got it.

117
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,374
-Hey.
-What's up, Bug?

118
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,836
This fucking town
is sucking our souls dry.

119
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,338
We need to fucking go.

120
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,256
Can you hear me out here?

121
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,758
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

122
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,136
We gotta get the fuck out of this town!

123
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,555
-Okay, Bug.
-There ain't shit for us here!

124
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,473
Y'all really just want to just fucking go?
For real?

125
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,851
Yeah. Let's go to the fucking city.

126
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,561
How good does that shit sound?

127
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,314
-Fucking hell.
-All of us together, let's do this shit!

128
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,065
Let's fucking go. Get up!

129
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,233
We're going now?

130
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,904
My mom would beat the shit out of me.

131
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,071
-You wanna go?
-Okay.

132
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,032
That right there is
God's way of telling us.

133
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,867
That van has its window rolled down.

134
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,035
-I could boost it, man.
-Do that shit.

135
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,412
All you gotta do is you get
the red with the blue.

136
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,955
Hey, look, I watch YouTube videos,
all right?

137
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,498
-Okay.
-Stop it. Stop it.

138
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,416
Go.

139
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,545
Shit. Got it. Got it!

140
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,256
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up!

141
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,927
-Let's go.
-Here we go.

142
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,637
-Yay!
-Yes. Yes.

143
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,975
You all gave me...

144
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,062
Honestly, Bug, you gave me
these small-ass joints.

145
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,439
-"Just trade it to her."
-Okay?

146
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,067
We really just stole a fucking van.

147
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,902
Nah, I don't want to know...

148
00:12:57,194 --> 00:13:00,405
And so, she left on a journey
with the boy and her friends.

149
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,618
The road was full of new places.

150
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,954
Enchanted.

151
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:16,380
And she felt something
she may have never felt before.

152
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,641
Wait. Wear them horns
on your head like this.

153
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,142
Wait. Stand right...

154
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,280
Which way do you look at?

155
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,743
What's pure happiness to you?

156
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:50,581
Happiness.

157
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,291
What is happiness for me?

158
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,376
It's a feeling. It's an emotion,

159
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,213
it's something that you can't necessarily
hold in your hands,

160
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,633
but still it has so much impact

161
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:04,303
on how you live, how you breathe,
how you think.

162
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,528
Did you not examine it?

163
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:25,782
You're first. Okay. Truth or dare?

164
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,951
I hate you guys.

165
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,122
All right. I dare you
to get up on this table

166
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,832
and sing "Mary Had a Little Lamb."

167
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,251
Okay. I'll make the beat.

168
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:37,961
I've been waiting for this moment.

169
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,548
All right. Five, six,
seven, eight. Hit it.

170
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,486
Please, sir.

171
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,280
-Please don't dance on the table.
-I'm sorry.

172
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,741
Sorry, ma'am.

173
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,622
Hey, five seconds, switch,
and you got it. Here we go.

174
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,874
What do you pick? What do you pick?
Truth or dare?

175
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,835
Truth.

176
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,587
All right, truth. 'Cause we did
kinda get a little wild.

177
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,464
All right. Let's calm down.

178
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,091
-Let's calm down.
-You got any "truths"?

179
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,552
Just corny ones.

180
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,013
Like, you think you ever been in love?

181
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,349
Yeah, absolutely. I love all y'all.

182
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,227
Nah. Nah, nah, nah.

183
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,397
Not that love. Not that love.
Not that love. Not homie love.

184
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,441
Do you believe in falling in love?

185
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,195
I don't know if you can fall in love,

186
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,364
because, like, I'm not... I don't know.

187
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,700
No! It's too much, too much, too much.

188
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,243
-Too much, too deep, right?
-I don't know. I...

189
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,664
Yeah, too... Yeah. No. I love hard.
So, that's what it is. I feel like you...

190
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,126
Yeah.

191
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,005
Yes. Yes, I am.

192
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,382
Would that person know it?

193
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,300
No.

194
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,177
No. She won't.

195
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,263
Who's paying for this, though?

196
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,390
Y'all, I got us.

197
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,893
-Hey.
-Hey, let me look at that.

198
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:24,693
Hey, you must be a...

199
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,102
How are you feeling about this trip?

200
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,188
I don't regret it.

201
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,941
-That's good.
-We out here.

202
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,108
We out here.

203
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,987
That's good. Yeah. I don't know.

204
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,241
I hope everyone's on board
with this shit, though. You know?

205
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,993
I ain't going back. Fuck going back.

206
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,271
Shit. My bad, bro. I'm sorry.

207
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,147
Hey, bro, you scared
the shit out of me, man.

208
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,066
Yeah. Bad for the smoking, man.

209
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,278
It's all good. It's all good.
It's what heathens call it, right?

210
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,197
I guess you're right.

211
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,825
-Man, you scared the shit out of me.
-Shit.

212
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,661
-Take my shit.
-All right. All right. Okay.

213
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,913
You from out here, bro?

214
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,584
I'm on a road trip with my family.
We're trying to go to the Grand Canyon.

215
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,503
Shit. I've never been to the Grand Canyon.

216
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:07,504
Don't go!

217
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,257
That shit ain't nothing
but a hole in the ground, man.

218
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,592
-Yeah.
-Shit's over-rated.

219
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,302
Yeah.

220
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,096
Honestly, I'm out here
with my friends, too.

221
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,933
We were supposed to go
on this crazy-ass road trip to the city,

222
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,560
but I think I'm gonna go home.

223
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:22,895
Yeah? Why? Why's that?

224
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,689
I'm not built for this.

225
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,567
In the moment,
I thought things would be different.

226
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,527
Now I just wanna take my ass home.

227
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,779
It's understandable, man.

228
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:36,158
Sometimes in life,
you have too much expectation.

229
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,242
Yeah.

230
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,495
And when reality hits you
and everything's settled,

231
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,247
you know, then you sort of figure it out.

232
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,958
You don't even look like the smoking type.

233
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,919
-Word?
-That shit's crazy.

234
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:47,836
No shit.

235
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,921
I'm faded.

236
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,425
You don't say that
'cause I got the cowboy boots on?

237
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,220
-I think it might be the boots.
-It might be the boots.

238
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,264
-This don't go with the boots.
-No.

239
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:00,390
But I'mma tell you something, though.

240
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:03,894
Sometimes it's just the little moments.
When you take a moment,

241
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,314
you enjoy the view, you know,

242
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,899
and just count your blessings.

243
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:09,816
Shit.

244
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,237
I'mma tell you something that

245
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,824
these grown folks
ain't going to tell young bucks,

246
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,826
'cause it's too harsh of a reality.

247
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,081
You don't ever have it figured out.

248
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,000
Fuck.

249
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,335
You just get older.

250
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,006
Honestly, when you put it that way,
I think you're right, man.

251
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,019
I moved to LA from El Paso, Texas.

252
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:50,440
I'm a military kid,
so I lived all over the place.

253
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,527
If I were to build
a relationship with someone,

254
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,738
or a friendship or whatever it was,

255
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,782
in a year or two, they'd end up leaving

256
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,200
and moving somewhere else.

257
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,119
That's always the saddest part.

258
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,705
The losing the friends.

259
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,967
It's time to dip.

260
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,636
-Dip, like...
-Like...

261
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:22,431
Y'all going back?

262
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,142
We can't... We can't do this no more.

263
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,269
Do what?

264
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,107
We were on this path of
y'all trying to find yourselves,

265
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,358
or whatever y'all got going on,

266
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,319
but for real, we gotta go.

267
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,196
Why can't you go back home with us, bro?

268
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,739
I can't go back, y'all.

269
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,409
There ain't nothing for me.

270
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:45,412
All of y'all are going.

271
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,330
-You going?
-Yeah.

272
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,207
For real, y'all?
You're just about to bounce?

273
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:11,480
There's a point in every journey,
in every adventure,

274
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:14,024
when you've travelled so far
that you've lost sight of both

275
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,985
your home and your destination.

276
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,281
It's in those dark moments
that true explorers are tested,

277
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,866
boundaries pushed.

278
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
It's when companions turn back,
the chaff falls away,

279
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,749
and you're left to find your own path.

280
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,085
Well, the girl refused to turn back.

281
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,006
They had to press on.

282
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,517
What is pure happiness to you?

283
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,939
Pure happiness is...

284
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,192
just looking in the mirror

285
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,571
and just being comfortable with yourself.

286
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,877
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.

287
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,007
What's going on? What's going on, Trey?
Do you got...

288
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,426
-I'm about to die.
-You're not gonna die, Trey.

289
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,303
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

290
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,434
It's gonna be okay, Trey.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

291
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,102
It's gonna be okay.

292
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,116
All right.

293
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,290
All right.

294
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,295
Highly over-rated.

295
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,473
It actually tastes like freedom.

296
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:16,271
-No, no, no.
-Real shit. Don't fucking shit at me.

297
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,773
That's the last shit to say, bro.

298
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:22,611
I'm on some real shit and I would like
to thank you for buying me this,

299
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,698
because I feel very amazing,

300
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:30,244
and off that, I'll take a big bite
just for you.

301
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:39,086
Lady Bug guaped up,
got the unlimited credit card.

302
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,880
Where did you even get that credit card?

303
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,217
Can you get my phone out of the car?

304
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,177
It's in your purse?

305
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:49,763
All right, got you.

306
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,400
You know, the consistency of the fries,

307
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,237
it's, like, quite astonishing.

308
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,574
-Shut up. Shut up.
-Quite astounding. No, no, no...

309
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,375
...like your hand about to fall off.

310
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:04,588
Hey.

311
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:07,716
-What's up, my bro?
-What took so long?

312
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,717
Here.

313
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,385
Hey, did you grab my phone?

314
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,431
You were out here the whole time.

315
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,643
-You didn't even grab the phone.
-It's in the front seat.

316
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,188
-All right.
-Is my book still in there?

317
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,567
Yo, check it.

318
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:31,865
They got actual humans in there.

319
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,829
-It's like some animal shit.
-Step the fuck back.

320
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,207
-They look hungry.
-Yeah, man.

321
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,084
-I said step away from the vehicle.
-They're starving.

322
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,961
-The little girl is starving, bro.
-There's a little girl in there.

323
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,379
I'm not gonna ask you again.

324
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,047
Hey, man, this is all humans, man.

325
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,132
-Like, you really signed up for this shit?
-I'm not gonna ask you again.

326
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,218
They're people, too.

327
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,595
-Yeah, they're really people, too, man.
-Boys, take your friends

328
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,222
-and step away from the vehicle right now.
-Yo, yo, calm down.

329
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,682
Yeah, you're a real fucking tough guy,
aren't you?

330
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:58,225
-Yeah, I am.
-You see something on my fucking face?

331
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,477
Have you guys ate something?
Have you guys ate something?

332
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,313
-Step away from the vehicle, boy.
-Yo, chill, chill.

333
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:04,648
-"Boy"?
-Yeah, "boy."

334
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,567
-Don't fucking touch him.
-You gonna hit me with the "boy," man?

335
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,735
Hey, man, days like that,
that's over with, man.

336
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,195
We're really trying to move on
from that, man.

337
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,655
Don't hit me with the "boy"
'cause I'm not a boy.

338
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,365
"Move on from that"?
I told you to move on.

339
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,450
Get the fuck away from this van.

340
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,537
-You're being aggressive for no reason.
-Step away.

341
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,747
All I'm saying is, I'm not trying
to be aggressive, bro.

342
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,708
-Fuck this. We don't gotta...
-Let's go.

343
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,209
Hey, cop, calm him down.

344
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,004
-Get in the car.
-Hey, I'm not resisting, I'm backing up.

345
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,409
Bug.

346
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,413
Bug, you awake? You awake, Bug?

347
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,624
What? What's up?

348
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,503
-You good?
-Yeah.

349
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:10,672
What's up?

350
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,096
Do you love me?

351
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,558
The fuck?

352
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,019
Why the fuck are you asking me that?

353
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:26,730
Do you?

354
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,485
I can't do this, go to sleep.
Go to sleep, Marcus.

355
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,785
What do you think about
her and Trey's relationship?

356
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,588
There is... I mean,
they're just friends, you know?

357
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,507
They're just friends. I've...

358
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:58,762
It gets me tight.

359
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,235
-You got that one out, huh?
-Yes.

360
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,613
That was like... Sounds like you're angry.

361
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,740
-That wasn't angry.
-This is crazy.

362
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,158
You don't know me angry.

363
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,495
The air feels different.

364
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,874
Who would've thought, like, 10 days ago
we'd have been on this shit.

365
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,294
They keep always fucking littering
on this fucking shit.

366
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:31,503
Pick it up.

367
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,466
"Bulltown Rodeo."

368
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,011
I haven't been to a rodeo before.

369
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,972
Yes, a fucking rodeo.
Hey, we should go to this.

370
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,350
Bug, we should go. You know, the rodeo
and the shit with the bulls?

371
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,564
-Yeah.
-Yeah, baby.

372
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:00,782
-We're fucking late.
-For real.

373
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,077
-It is cold as fuck.
-Where's all the people?

374
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,833
This shit is nice, like,
what the fuck is this shit?

375
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,168
This is the rodeo.

376
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,089
Hey, what's up, man?

377
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:18,217
I like your horse.

378
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:22,429
She nervous?

379
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,557
No, I wouldn't say she's nervous.

380
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,023
I don't see no bulls.

381
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,778
-Didn't the sign say bull, bull riding?
-It did.

382
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:39,029
I think it's coming up.

383
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:48,956
Shit.

384
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:51,625
Dang.

385
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,546
-So majestic.
-She taking off.

386
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,590
Yeah, she's hard.

387
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,636
It's crazy how she really know
what she's doing,

388
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,221
like, she's controlling it.

389
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,809
See how fast that thing going?

390
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,897
That's crazy.

391
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,274
That's Hallie.

392
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,109
She was county champ last year.

393
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:21,989
-Y'all do this a lot?
-Yeah. All our lives.

394
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:25,409
Y'all ain't from around here, are you?

395
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,829
-I'm Taylor.
-I'm Annie.

396
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:31,456
-I'm Trey. Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

397
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,624
-Nice to meet you guys.
-I'm Marcus.

398
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:33,959
I'm Lady Bug.

399
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:35,836
This what y'all do around here?

400
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,215
I mean, this is kinda it. We just kinda
come to these, hang around.

401
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,509
I mean, look around, there's not much.

402
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,053
Shit.

403
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,931
Thought it would be more exciting.

404
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,434
This is some shit you get drunk at,
for sure.

405
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:51,977
Yeah.

406
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,522
Do you guys wanna drink?

407
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,024
Fuck, yeah.

408
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:22,966
Always on some different shit, huh?

409
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,259
Love that dude.

410
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,428
You like Trey more than me?

411
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,306
Shut the fuck up with that shit.

412
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,600
You're such a hater, damn.

413
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:33,602
You're such a fucking hater.

414
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,187
-Who am I sitting with right now?
-That's not smooth.

415
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,272
-I've seen smoother shit.
-You have?

416
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,273
Yeah.

417
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:40,609
-Can you do smoother shit, though?
-Not right now.

418
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,070
Of course, not on the spot.
You're putting me on the spot right now.

419
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,079
Everyone's the same everywhere you go.

420
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,413
-Nah.
-Yeah.

421
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:57,918
Out here, I already know
shit is entirely different.

422
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:02,005
If I lived out here,
I would be lit all the time.

423
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,717
I wanna take a trip like you guys did.
I think that'll be fun.

424
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:08,345
Fuck a trip, man.

425
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,181
Are you guys not having fun here?

426
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,910
He has a crush on her,
I know that for a fact.

427
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,496
And Lady Bug
would not admit that, definitely.

428
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,959
In Lady Bug's eyes, though,
they're just friends, so, it's whatever.

429
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,752
You know, I don't have anything...

430
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:09,882
I love Trey.

431
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:17,808
He definitely knows
how I feel about her, though.

432
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:21,395
I got these B-E-E-R.

433
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:22,980
-Beer. Beer.
-B-E-E-R.

434
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,398
Let's go. We're leaving, bro.

435
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:26,315
I'm done with this. We fucking out.

436
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:27,734
-What's up?
-Bro, calm down.

437
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,360
Don't tell me to fucking calm down.

438
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,946
Yo, yo, yo, chill out, man.

439
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,906
-You smell like alcohol...
-I'm fucking leaving.

440
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,032
Are you just not having a good time?

441
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,617
-Like, what's up?
-Yeah.

442
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,911
I'm fucking done with this.
These people are fucking losers.

443
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:40,414
-Okay, just chill. Chill.
-I'm done with this shit.

444
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,915
-Calm down.
-Get in the fucking van.

445
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,417
-You coming with me?
-We don't got to take no van.

446
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,752
-Yo, chill, chill.
-Get calmed down.

447
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,212
What the fuck, Marcus?

448
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,177
-Yo, yo, Marcus, hey.
-Marcus, where are you going?

449
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,969
-Text Annie.
-Okay, I'll text Annie.

450
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,306
Calm down, man, what you doing?

451
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:00,225
-Yo, yo, yo.
-Marcus, I just want some.

452
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:02,436
-Take it away. Take it away.
-I just want some, Marcus.

453
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,354
Come on. Come on, bro. Get in the car.
Get in the car, man.

454
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,607
Right here. Go ahead. Get in there.

455
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:14,615
I hated that he got so jealous.

456
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:18,577
You know, like, the me and Trey thing

457
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,704
was always something
that really tick him off.

458
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:25,584
He's just insecure and very lost.

459
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,504
Hey, man, text Annie.

460
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:30,589
Make sure she know
that we gonna come back for her.

461
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,300
Trey, you gonna tell
Lady Bug you love her?

462
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,010
This is...

463
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,930
Marcus, you're drunk, just leave it alone.

464
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:44,228
Why you all always fucking
teaming up on me for no reason?

465
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,106
-What?
-The fuck?

466
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,943
-What are you talking about?
-What am I talking about?

467
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,362
You guys both know
what I'm fucking talking about.

468
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,030
-You're talking bullshit, man.
-I'm not fucking crazy.

469
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:56,573
-You talking out your ass, bro.
-I'm not fucking stupid.

470
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,659
I've seen the same shit
that y'all been fucking living.

471
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,577
-You're a fucking item.
-I don't wanna hear that, man.

472
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,287
We're not no fucking item, man.

473
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,206
Ain't nothing up here, Marcus, chill out.

474
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,333
-And you don't even know shit.
-I don't know shit?

475
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,544
You don't even know
why the fuck we're out here.

476
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:10,796
He's only out here
'cause he likes you, you know that?

477
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,633
Man, what the fuck. Fuck all y'all.

478
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:17,511
-Marcus...
-I'm out. Keep that shit.

479
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,097
Keep that shit, man.

480
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,808
Marcus, leave him alone.
Marcus, leave him alone.

481
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,687
You were acting tough.

482
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:28,605
Chill, what more you need?

483
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:31,149
Man, can you smell yourself, bro?
You're fucking drunk right now, man.

484
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,526
Just like your dad, man.

485
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,695
-You're turning exactly like your dad--
-Motherfucking--

486
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:36,446
Marcus, leave him alone. Marcus.

487
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,115
-Keep saying that shit.
-Keep that shit.

488
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,408
-Get the fuck out of here!
-You're acting like your father.

489
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:40,659
You don't fucking know me!

490
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,703
You don't know fucking shit about my dad.

491
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,705
Stop, yo, stop! Stop!

492
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,206
Hey, fuck you, man.

493
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,833
-Fuck me?
-Fuck you, bro.

494
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,877
You stay with your drunk boyfriend,

495
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,545
whatever the fuck y'all got going on, man,

496
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,755
keep that shit.
Keep that shit to yourself, all right?

497
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,757
-Trey, where are you going?
-I'm out of here, man.

498
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:05,017
Okay, but who got the GPS?

499
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,396
You got the end like that...

500
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,856
-You hold it like so.
-...and you eat it.

501
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:13,400
-Eat what? The joint?
-Yeah.

502
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:17,321
I think the best part of the trip...

503
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:23,202
was when we first got the van.

504
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,921
I feel like, in this life,

505
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:37,174
it's like a journey
to find yourself, you know?

506
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,635
You spend your whole life
figuring out yourself

507
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:41,553
and when you do figure out,
you know, like,

508
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:45,807
everything about yourself,
it keeps you at peace.

509
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,898
You know,

510
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,152
I love Lady Bug.

511
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,117
I feel like she's the type of person
I would wanna...

512
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,162
raise a family with, you know?

513
00:38:09,373 --> 00:38:11,416
Everybody loves Lady Bug, though.

514
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,128
Literally everybody.

515
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,810
We all felt this similar happiness.

516
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,728
That was cool,

517
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:34,106
because it was like we were all as one.

518
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,379
Marcus.

519
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:02,217
Marcus, it's okay. It's okay.

520
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,929
He's so crazy.

521
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,850
But the best kind of crazy.

522
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:18,150
You gotta...

523
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,235
You gotta go.

524
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:03,899
It's easy to get lost
trying to figure things out.

525
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,111
No one really knows why we're here.

526
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:12,324
So, we all look to different places
to find purpose and meaning.

527
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:16,745
Maybe it's a new city,
maybe it's another person.

528
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:23,293
But the truth is,
purpose isn't something external.

529
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,214
It's something we create in our hearts,

530
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:30,843
our thoughts, our dreams.

531
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:35,305
It's okay not to have things figured out,

532
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,349
to not know who you are in this world.

533
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,687
Because the world
doesn't define who you are.

534
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:43,522
You do.

535
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,278
And once you've accepted that,

536
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:53,323
well, that's the day
you'll finally be free.

537
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:20,475
And if you could give yourself
a message for in 10 years,

538
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:23,437
if you look at this camera
and know you'll watch it in 10 years,

539
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,022
what would that message be?

540
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:30,652
My message in 10 years would be,
"Bitch, you did that shit."

541
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:35,866
Man, I don't know what you did, bro,
I hope that you... No.

542
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:38,911
Grind, baby, be on that grind.

543
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,247
Don't be idle,
know you were weak for that reason,

544
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:44,416
you gotta move on, you know?

545
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:50,047
I don't wanna ever see you being sad
for no reason, you know?

546
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,050
I love you. I fucking love you, baby.

547
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:55,677
And I see you and I recognise you.

548
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,179
That's love.

549
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,350
I would love to see that,

550
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,727
if it was me 10 years from now.

551
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:09,816
All right. This is crazy,
'cause this is very emotional for me.

552
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,528
Ten years from now, Khalid,

553
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:16,573
you're gonna have done
a lot of crazy shit,

554
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,325
lot of great shit.

555
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:21,119
You probably got too drunk on your 21st,

556
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:23,580
it's okay, your friends picked you up.

557
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:27,376
Hopefully, some of those friends
are still by your side in 10 years.

558
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:32,381
And hopefully, you mean it
when you say that you're happy.

559
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,470
Hopefully, you're still yourself

560
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:41,348
and hopefully, there's still
a little bit of me in you,

561
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:44,560
the day that you watch this,
10 years from now.

562
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:50,774
Love you.

563
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,027
Mutha... Joshua tree.

564
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:56,446
Okay, we good? Can we go?

565
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,241
-Yes.
-Let's fucking go!

566
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:01,743
I think we need the key.

567
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,954
I need a key.
There's no key in the car.

568
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:06,081
Guys, there's no key in the car.

569
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,042
"It's trying to get lit",
is old folks talk.

570
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:10,294
I got you. I got you.

571
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:12,087
-And that shit is booty.
-Thank you.

572
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:13,839
They got these.

573
00:45:15,966 --> 00:45:18,927
I'm using this microscope
and they still look like...

574
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:22,472
I don't know why they give this
to people. Well, not people...

575
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:26,018
-The chickens.
-Well, animals are people too.

576
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:34,234
We're kind of cute, baby.

577
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:37,738
Yeah, we need to tell.

578
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,364
I was peeing looking at the stars

579
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:42,367
and the wolf started howling
the entire time I was peeing.

580
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,578
-What?
-How does that feel as a person?

581
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:48,248
Because it was the most beautiful
pee I've had in my life. I swear.

582
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:52,085
It was howling when I was peeing
and looking at the stars.

583
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:53,587
Bro, shut up.

584
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,514
I'm a wolf!
