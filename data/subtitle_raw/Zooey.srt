2
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,463
Wait, don't run away.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,253
Come back here.

4
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,250
Don't run away.

5
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,079
A pet or a monster?

6
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:53,498
Wherever he
is, I've got to find him,

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,418
if I have to search every
street, every house,

8
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,754
every alley, every inch of this...

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,233
Come back.

10
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:13,990
Hey, boy, where are you?

11
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,978
Where are you, pal?

12
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,103
Come here.

13
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,926
Noah?

14
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,933
- Did you wipe the tires off?
- Yes, Owen.

15
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,053
Oh, okay.

16
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,793
Shoes.

17
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,222
Yo, I can start this over,
if you wanna watch it.

18
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,988
It's a good one.

19
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,958
This woman, she was walking
her dog late one night,

20
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,498
and then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere,

21
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,298
she gets sucked up into the
sky by extraterrestrials.

22
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,638
Now, when she was a kid,

23
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,128
the same thing happened
to her younger brother,

24
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,657
but he was just five.

25
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,278
Now, while she was in this lost spaceship,

26
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,332
she found her long, lost younger brother,

27
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:51,288
but he was still five.

28
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,108
Oh, man, had I been abducted,

29
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,193
I would never want to come back.

30
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,046
You're awfully quiet tonight.

31
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:10,429
What are you doing?

32
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:11,264
Nothing.

33
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:16,438
You sure?

34
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,107
Yeah, yeah, I just
missed you, that's all.

35
00:05:22,109 --> 00:05:26,458
Uh-uh, now I know you're lying.

36
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,468
Grab me a soda from the fridge.

37
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,720
Geez, what are you, 13?

38
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:45,888
You out of school already?

39
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,940
It's summer, idiot.

40
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,218
Oh, shit.

41
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,108
Ah, ah, what time is it?

42
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,418
Is that the time?

43
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,157
Oh, Noah, get on your coat.

44
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,258
We've gotta go.

45
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,959
Come on, let's go, Noah,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

46
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,540
Oh, shit, let's go, get up, come on, man.

47
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,542
What are you doing, kid?

48
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,817
Hey, let's go, let's go.

49
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,458
- Ah, there he is.
- Hey, Joe,

50
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,818
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Ah, don't sweat it.

51
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,598
Right, we've got a lot to go out today.

52
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,549
Almost forgot.

53
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,663
- That one's kind of heavy.
- Okay.

54
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:02,901
Yup, you weren't kidding.

55
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:05,128
- Got it?
- Who me?

56
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,728
Yeah, of course.

57
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,876
Now, remember, if you
got comics, I want 'em.

58
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,639
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:13,048
Nostalgia's a powerful drug.

60
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,549
Sure is.

61
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:15,880
Later, Joe.

62
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:16,715
Bye.

63
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:22,818
Thank you.

64
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,853
Number 46.

65
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,803
Head out, let's go, huh?

66
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,208
Hey,
man, don't drop the package.

67
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,408
We need that.

68
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,870
Boy, I love this weather.

69
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,836
Oh, no, we don't want magazines or...

70
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:47,641
It's cool, it's just a package.

71
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,755
Oh, sweet, one sec.

72
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:51,010
- Me?
- Yeah, you heard me.

73
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,901
He wants you to fix the bell.

74
00:08:52,903 --> 00:08:54,798
Oh, it's just a pinball machine.

75
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,881
Well, listen, why don't
you let me get Arland?

76
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,098
He's got all the tools.

77
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,010
He knows all about it.

78
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,549
I don't know.

79
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:00,718
Here you go.

80
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:04,242
- Oh, thanks.
- Have a good one.

81
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,433
Where the tips?

82
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,863
Good?

83
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,744
- Hungry?
- Starving.

84
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:28,037
My man.

85
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,501
Where the hell do
you think you're going?

86
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:01,358
- What's it to you?
- No, no,

87
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,618
we're not done talking yet.

88
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,713
Yeah, well, I am.

89
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,472
You don't make the rules
around here, you got I?

90
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,183
Get off of me.

91
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,508
I'm telling you, man, it was a dead body.

92
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,588
- No way, man.
- He put it in that car.

93
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,868
No way, you're making this up.

94
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,668
Listen, it looked like
he put a girl in that car.

95
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,830
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

96
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,758
I think you've been watching

97
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,958
too many scary movies, kid.

98
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,793
Shut up.

99
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,910
Hey, dude, that's expensive, man.

100
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:27,778
Come on.

101
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,808
Get out the way, get out the way.

102
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,160
Oh, this key's not working.

103
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,480
You okay?

104
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,373
Just please don't let him in.

105
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:46,375
Hey, hey, everything's
going to be okay, all right?

106
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,080
I won't let him anywhere near you.

107
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,108
Oh, shit.

108
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,193
I know you're in there.

109
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,503
Hey, go to the bathroom,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

110
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,383
Come on, I'm just here for the kid.

111
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,258
Ah, what's up, my brother?

112
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,518
You seem very angry.

113
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,128
Where's the kid?

114
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,058
Huh, what, what?

115
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,468
Listen, I don't know who you are

116
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,768
but give me my goddamn kid and
stay the hell away from him,

117
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,958
- got it?
- Sir,

118
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,791
I think you have the wrong room, sir.

119
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,806
, you goddamn fool.

120
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,303
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

121
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,077
You good?

122
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,803
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

123
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,702
Well, everything go okay?

124
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,713
What do you mean?

125
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,628
The delivery.

126
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,763
Oh, yeah, that,

127
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,933
just peachy.

128
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:52,915
Peachy?

129
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:56,369
Dude, you're weird.

130
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,621
Leave me alone.

131
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,958
Oh, why today of all days?

132
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,860
I just want sleep.

133
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,343
- Can I help you?
- No.

134
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,123
Yes, actually.

135
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,581
One moment.

136
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,353
Do you mind?

137
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,281
- Yeah.
- Oh, oh, oh.

138
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,116
Mm-hmm.

139
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,248
What the hell were you doing in my room?

140
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,668
Well, look, I swear,

141
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,102
I didn't even know that you were in there.

142
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:47,168
He dropped his room key.

143
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,148
Yeah, yeah, you should
totally have it back up.

144
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,970
I'm sorry about that.

145
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,128
I saw him walking around
with dirt and stuff in there

146
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,708
and he never really talks to anyone.

147
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,538
I thought that I saw him carry
a dead body into his car,

148
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,418
and I don't know, just the
whole thing looked really shady.

149
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,698
Shady?

150
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,953
Yeah, like maybe he's
a killer or something.

151
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,518
My brother?

152
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,188
Yeah, I don't know.

153
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,023
He's not.

154
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,808
Okay, well, that's cool, I guess.

155
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,193
I just wasn't feeling good,

156
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,603
and the dirt's for the bath, obviously.

157
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,817
It's not that strange.

158
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:30,618
Oh, no, no, I've heard of
people take mud baths and stuff

159
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,818
because it's supposed to be
good for your skin and stuff,

160
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,978
but I've just never really done that.

161
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,173
Yeah, I always shower.

162
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,103
Not always.

163
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,488
I don't shower all the time.

164
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,778
I don't have some sort
of a weird odor problem

165
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,880
or anything like that.

166
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,018
I'm a clean person.

167
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,453
I shower the normal amount.

168
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,428
Gotcha, well, look,
whatever your name is,

169
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,698
don't come into my room again, got it?

170
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,913
Yeah, of course.

171
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,303
Noah.

172
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,948
What?

173
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,063
I'm Noah.

174
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,203
Yeah, I just thought you should know.

175
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:13,930
Zooey.

176
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,700
Nice to meet ya.

177
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,743
What?

178
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,573
Who was that?

179
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:33,408
Nobody.

180
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,558
Does nobody have a name?

181
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,688
- Just forget it.
- All right, fine.

182
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,348
If you don't wanna share.

183
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,748
I just walked into the
wrong room, that's all.

184
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,918
It's a motel.

185
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,408
- There's numbers on the door.
- Yeah, just drop the subject.

186
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,403
I'm off, I'm off.

187
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,168
She was cute.

188
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,434
Shut up.

189
00:18:21,845 --> 00:18:25,393
Oh, sorry, I didn't
know anyone was in here.

190
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,173
No, no, it's fine, really, totally.

191
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,243
It's fine.

192
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,263
So you planning on swimming?

193
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,358
What?

194
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,623
Oh, no.

195
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,413
Oh, I get it, you
don't know how to swim.

196
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,318
Oh my God, you actually
don't know how to swim.

197
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,373
It's fine.

198
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,573
Nobody taught me.

199
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,777
How about you?

200
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,288
Well, I wouldn't come to the pool

201
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,740
if I didn't know how to swim.

202
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,943
I did.

203
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:09,615
Ah, okay,

204
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,975
I'm just gonna have to go in.

205
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:22,802
I can do this, okay.

206
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,338
Oh, God, I'm sorry,

207
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,233
it just looked like you were
maybe drowning or something.

208
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:36,129
I don't know.

209
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,783
You were just under there
for a very long time.

210
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:44,148
Were you gonna jump in?

211
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,470
- Well, I was...
- Zooey.

212
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,730
What were you thinking?

213
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,278
You can't just run off like that.

214
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,858
I didn't run off.

215
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,988
I went to go swim.

216
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,508
I don't care where you went.

217
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,860
What if something happened?

218
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,298
You're being paranoid.

219
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,198
I'm being cautious, Zooey.

220
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,608
Do you want to spend the
rest of your time in a place

221
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,608
that doesn't understand you?

222
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,723
A place that'll hurt you until it does?

223
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,468
No.

224
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,558
Because that's what's going to happen

225
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,293
if somebody finds out.

226
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,583
I'm just trying to keep you safe.

227
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,420
If anything were to happen to you, I...

228
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,493
Just please?

229
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,611
You don't have much more time.

230
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,593
I'm sorry.

231
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,023
I know.

232
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,263
Who was that out there?

233
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,923
Just some kid.

234
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,192
Okay.

235
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:39,073
What are you doing?

236
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:42,624
Nothing.

237
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,340
You're weird, kid.

238
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,527
Don't go in there for awhile.

239
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:22,857
Extraterrestrials.

240
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,360
Can't sleep, huh?

241
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,788
Milkshake time, let's go.

242
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,008
What time?

243
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,197
You heard me, it's milkshake time.

244
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,032
Go, let's go.

245
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,881
Come on.

246
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,143
Ow, brain freeze.

247
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,503
Oh, I love milkshakes.

248
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,693
So?

249
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,048
What?

250
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,923
That girl.

251
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,418
- Zooey?
- Bingo.

252
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,206
She has a name.

253
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,041
Shut up.

254
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,048
Oh, man, so how's she doing?

255
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,058
- Fine.
- Oh, you think she's fine?

256
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,553
That is not what I said.

257
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:12,823
Oh, man,

258
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,998
to be young again, chasing girls around.

259
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,600
You did a lot of girl chasing?

260
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,863
Nope.

261
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,823
Just aliens then?

262
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Yo, wait, is that...?

263
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,113
Yo, what is that?

264
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,598
That's a freaking UFO.

265
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,738
That's a goddamn...

266
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,623
Wait, my bad, that's a plane.

267
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,883
Anyway, I'm happy for you, kid, truly.

268
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,313
You should ask her out.

269
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:07,262
Oh, man, I don't know about you,

270
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:10,633
but all this sugar's making me tired.

271
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,103
Ready to go?

272
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:17,185
Let's do it.

273
00:26:17,187 --> 00:26:20,848
Yes, dear, what is it?

274
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,300
When I came to your
place, it was because of...

275
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,150
Yes?

276
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,357
I just arrived here.

277
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,988
I did not know where else to go,

278
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,483
but everything was so strange to me.

279
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,580
I'm glad you came, so is grandpa.

280
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,543
Gotta meet family and friends.

281
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:17,336
Hey.

282
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,171
Hey.

283
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,313
So what's up?

284
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,301
Nothing.

285
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:28,173
Okay, guess I'll see you later then.

286
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,961
Oh, wait, wait,

287
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:31,498
I came over here to ask you

288
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,083
if you wanted to go see
something or go do something?

289
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,163
Go out to do something with me?

290
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,623
Yeah, sure.

291
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,558
Yeah?

292
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,393
Yeah.

293
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:49,659
Yeah?

294
00:27:50,618 --> 00:27:52,234
Mm-hmm.

295
00:27:52,236 --> 00:27:53,819
Yeah, okay, cool.

296
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I'll just go and find with
something for us to do.

297
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,633
I'll get back to you.

298
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,723
Sounds good.

299
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,493
For awesome.

300
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,523
For awesome?

301
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:25,057
For awesome.

302
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,103
Mind if I sit?

303
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,213
Plenty of room.

304
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:07,618
You live next door, right?

305
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,453
Taylor?

306
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,763
Yeah.

307
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,963
Owen.

308
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,405
Want a beer, Owen?

309
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,663
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,383
- So...
- They can't be together.

311
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:10,328
Zooey doesn't have time
to be playing around

312
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,893
with your little Noah.

313
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,448
What do you mean?

314
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,188
They're pretty good together.

315
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,723
Yeah, that's the problem.

316
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,113
It's not gonna work, it can't work,

317
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,250
so there's no point in them both

318
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,650
getting their feelings hurt.

319
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,333
But isn't that just a process though?

320
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,381
They're young.

321
00:33:43,383 --> 00:33:45,810
It's not like they're going
to be together forever.

322
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,183
What's going on?

323
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,683
I'm sorry.

324
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,848
You're fine.

325
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,683
No, it's okay.

326
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:06,843
Zooey's got a condition

327
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,503
and we don't have much longer,

328
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,713
so we just drove,

329
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,918
figured we'd see the country.

330
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,078
I'd never been further
west than Wisconsin,

331
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,003
so you know what's in Wisconsin?

332
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,733
Cheese?

333
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,253
Yeah, yeah, and nothing else.

334
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,060
- So you're just gonna...
- Just gonna go.

335
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,822
We figured we'd just really go.

336
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,520
This can't be the
final destination though.

337
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,203
No, no, it is nice though.

338
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,343
Yeah?

339
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,993
She picked it.

340
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,560
That'll be great.

341
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,413
So how long's she have left?

342
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:04,411
I don't know, I don't know,

343
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,883
a couple of weeks or less.

344
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,933
You can finish the beer.

345
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,140
Okay, I want to show you something,

346
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,857
but you have to promise
not to scream or anything?

347
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:38,798
What?

348
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,631
Promise.

349
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,783
Okay, I promise.

350
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,220
Oh, hey, that's...

351
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,413
You're a...

352
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,999
What are you?

353
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:11,408
I'm not from here.

354
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,818
Does anybody else know?

355
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,720
Just my brother.

356
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,468
This is amazing.

357
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,348
Can you do that tongue thing again?

358
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,181
What?

359
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:20,016
No.

360
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:26,128
This is crazy, crazy.

361
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,478
My girlfriend is an alien.

362
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,593
Hang on, girlfriend?

363
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,228
Did I say girlfriend?

364
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,438
No, no.

365
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,514
What I meant to say was...

366
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:41,078
No, no, I like it.

367
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,573
- Really?
- Yeah.

368
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,573
It just seems right.

369
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,438
I have so many questions.

370
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,390
Where are you from?

371
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,398
I don't know.

372
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,348
Oh, and the mud baths.

373
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,972
Is that how you feed or something?

374
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,288
No.

375
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,468
Can you breathe under water?

376
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,878
Oh, oh, oh, can you fly

377
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,030
or do you have super
strength or something?

378
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,943
Wow.

379
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So out of all the places,

380
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,273
why in a motel?

381
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,140
Before I was adopted by Richard,

382
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,463
he found me here.

383
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,683
I guess my parents just
left me there on the steps.

384
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,703
I don't know, dude.

385
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,773
I just feel like I've
always felt at home here,

386
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,123
more than any other place anyway.

387
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,080
I didn't know my parents either.

388
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,168
I always thought,

389
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,483
out of all the places they
could've left me in the galaxy,

390
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,223
they chose here.

391
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,313
Your brother, is he...?

392
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,203
No, he just found me,

393
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,903
saved me.

394
00:39:48,806 --> 00:39:51,670
He never told anyone what I was.

395
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,493
He always protected me.

396
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,213
What about your parents?

397
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,383
Do you think they'll ever come back?

398
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,121
It doesn't matter anymore.

399
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:15,223
It doesn't matter?

400
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,850
What's that supposed to mean?

401
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,173
I just don't care.

402
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,403
Do you think your parents
are out there somewhere?

403
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,750
I don't know.

404
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,503
Maybe.

405
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,043
Maybe not.

406
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,963
Well, I'm glad now that
my parents left me here.

407
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,353
I'm happy.

408
00:41:21,038 --> 00:41:22,371
Mm, whoa, man.

409
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,141
Why you so smiley?

410
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:30,338
We live about 20 steps
from her door to mine.

411
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,440
I think I'm in love.

412
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,828
Whoa, hold up, love?

413
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,828
Like love love?

414
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,378
Yeah.

415
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,213
Shit,

416
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,333
what's it like?

417
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:55,478
It's really weird.

418
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,248
Yeah, well, considering
the circumstances.

419
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,289
I just don't even know
what to do with my life.

420
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,468
What?

421
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:04,301
- What's so funny?
- You don't know what to do

422
00:42:04,303 --> 00:42:06,048
with your life.

423
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,688
Kid, I'm 30 years old,
living out of a motel,

424
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,378
using an empty chip bag
as a damn trashcan liner,

425
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,671
not to mention the only socializing I do

426
00:42:12,673 --> 00:42:14,828
is with a 14 year old.

427
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,198
And whose fault is that?

428
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,158
Entirely mine.

429
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,813
No, wait, so tell me what happened.

430
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,697
Oh, that's what you're going...

431
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:27,530
You're not going to tell me?

432
00:42:27,532 --> 00:42:28,363
You're just going to...

433
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:29,348
Okay, okay, all right, fine.

434
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,181
No donuts for you.

435
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:31,016
Get out of here.

436
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,098
I can see why you like this stuff.

437
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,608
It's so...

438
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,688
Sugary?

439
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,338
Yeah.

440
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,568
Here, have one of these.

441
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,423
It's always been one of my favorites.

442
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,540
Your eyes...

443
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,918
I've just never seen them like that.

444
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,028
Yeah, they do that sometimes.

445
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,463
No, it's beautiful.

446
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,690
I can't believe you've
never had any of these.

447
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,498
Yeah, my brother
doesn't really allow it.

448
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,333
That sucks.

449
00:43:43,657 --> 00:43:46,408
One time, Owen and I got a huge
bucket full of these things

450
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,323
and we downed it in 15 minutes.

451
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,868
Owen?

452
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,928
Yeah, the guy I live with.

453
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:53,880
Oh, your brother.

454
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:57,923
Not exactly.

455
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:02,803
He's like family.

456
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,887
Like family?

457
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,693
Is, I guess, is family.

458
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,123
Here, try one of these.

459
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,363
I do have to warn you though,

460
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,352
they tend to get a little bit...

461
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,393
Oh, no.

462
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,568
Sour.

463
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:33,401
Noah.

464
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:34,780
Sorry, Owen.

465
00:44:34,782 --> 00:44:38,328
Boy, you and that girl,
you're lucky, mm-hmm,

466
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,013
but you not sleeping
here tonight, go on home.

467
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,423
So what's going on?

468
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,583
Here.

469
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:00,568
Zooey, what are you doing with those?

470
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,738
Aren't you a little curious?

471
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,268
About what?

472
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,483
To try it, dummy.

473
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,263
No.

474
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:13,371
Okay, fine, it doesn't smell too bad.

475
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:16,468
What if you're allergic
to it or something?

476
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,848
I don't have any problems with gluten.

477
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,098
That's not what I'm talking about.

478
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,468
It's fine, Noah, here, try some.

479
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,303
No.

480
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:28,513
Fine, you're going to
make me drink alone then.

481
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,248
Oh, nice, peer pressure now.

482
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,681
Suit yourself.

483
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,920
Why do we adults drink that?

484
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,763
I honestly don't know.

485
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,298
You can finish it.

486
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,131
After all that,

487
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:50,297
you honestly think that
I'm going to want some?

488
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,668
Let's go do something else.

489
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,813
Oh my God.

490
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:38,123
Owen, hey, what's going on?

491
00:46:42,323 --> 00:46:45,510
I think I might have something for you.

492
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:47,679
Okay, let's have a look.

493
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,423
Oh, wow,

494
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,980
I haven't seen one of these
come in here for quite a while.

495
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:03,217
Where'd you get it?

496
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:04,669
I had it since I was a kid.

497
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:07,289
It was my first comic.

498
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:13,828
You sure?

499
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,048
You sure you want to sell?

500
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:17,883
I do.

501
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,243
Yeah.

502
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,268
Okay, well, the last
one we had come in here

503
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,070
was pretty beat up, let me tell you.

504
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,693
Still, it went for quite a bit,

505
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:40,710
but since this one's
mint, or basically mint,

506
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,790
probably looking at...

507
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,148
- Bull shit.
- No, sir.

508
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,113
What?

509
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,878
I know a guy who would
buy this in a heartbeat.

510
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,713
Who?

511
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,818
- Me.
- Really?

512
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,965
You say the word, I'll get
my cheque book right now.

513
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:13,967
You promise to
take good care of it, yeah?

514
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:16,817
Of course.

515
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:27,263
Let me get my cheque book.

516
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:32,005
Zooey.

517
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,340
It's okay, just breathe.

518
00:49:43,787 --> 00:49:45,287
Hey, just breathe.

519
00:49:48,844 --> 00:49:50,344
You're doing okay.

520
00:49:54,937 --> 00:49:56,187
You'll be okay.

521
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:01,905
Keep breathing, okay, okay.

522
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:25,657
Zooey's busy right now.

523
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:28,295
Yeah, okay, I was just...

524
00:50:46,484 --> 00:50:50,073
,
my sisters are calling.

525
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,693
Wake up, wake up now.

526
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,063
Our sisters are awake.

527
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:58,518
They're hungry.

528
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,460
They've slept it off.

529
00:51:00,462 --> 00:51:02,879
It's time to go into the sea.

530
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:33,742
Zooey?

531
00:51:54,974 --> 00:51:56,391
Where you been?

532
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,630
Are you just gonna ignore me like that?

533
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,628
I didn't even know you were coming.

534
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,463
Yeah.

535
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:41,018
Do you want to go somewhere?

536
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,143
Can we just sit and talk?

537
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:45,793
Yeah, sure.

538
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,328
I came over and knocked earlier...

539
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,163
I know.

540
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,428
He just seemed pretty upset with me.

541
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,918
It's not you.

542
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,888
Really?

543
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,793
Sometimes he just gets like that.

544
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:10,743
Like what?

545
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,753
Stressed out, mad or something,

546
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,848
usually because of me.

547
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,950
I'm sure it's not always because of you.

548
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,450
You're just saying that.

549
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,893
No, I'm really not.

550
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,753
Look, Noah,

551
00:53:36,364 --> 00:53:38,293
I don't think we should see each other.

552
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,358
What, you don't think...?

553
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,193
Why not?

554
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,593
We can't hang out, not anymore.

555
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,268
Is it Taylor?

556
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,143
No, it's not my brother.

557
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,628
What did I do?

558
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,880
You didn't do anything.

559
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,523
It's just because it's what I want.

560
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,128
I don't understand.

561
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,430
It's what's best for me.

562
00:54:22,247 --> 00:54:23,080
Okay.

563
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:57,063
New, bold, daring, I hate it.

564
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,400
Yo, you all right?

565
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,253
Talk to me, kid.

566
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,458
Zooey doesn't want to see me anymore.

567
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,510
Why? What happened?

568
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,263
I don't know.

569
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,475
I guess I'm just not good enough.

570
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:24,088
Oh, what the hell are you talking about?

571
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,493
She's just so special.

572
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,758
I'm just me.

573
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,683
No way.

574
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,203
I should have known.

575
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,738
Why would anyone like her
wanna be with someone like me?

576
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,440
Hey, what are you talking about?

577
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,458
He's right.

578
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,343
Who's right?

579
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,031
- Richard.
- Oh, no, no.

580
00:55:43,033 --> 00:55:44,758
- He's always been right.
- Hold on.

581
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,758
I'm just a piece of shit.

582
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,278
Hold on.

583
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,823
- It's all I am.
- No, hey,

584
00:55:51,525 --> 00:55:52,442
look at me.

585
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:55,268
I know you're not about to believe a word

586
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,220
that comes out of that asshole's mouth.

587
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,348
He's right.

588
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,463
No, he's wrong, Noah.

589
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,108
When he says stuff like that,

590
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,368
that has nothing to do with you.

591
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,853
It has everything to do with him.

592
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:13,573
Since when are you the expert?

593
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,643
Trust me, I know.

594
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,883
My parents were the same way.

595
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:29,433
As hard as it may seem, we
just can't believe that shit.

596
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,218
You gotta focus on you
and what makes you great,

597
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,923
because you are great.

598
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:39,783
Cool?

599
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,373
What?

600
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:55,728
It's not that weird.

601
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,289
It is that weird.

602
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,653
A little, yeah.

603
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,763
Point is, Richard's a loser.

604
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,080
You're nothing like him.

605
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,073
Who?

606
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,023
My man.

607
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:17,841
What?

608
00:57:17,843 --> 00:57:19,408
Get away from me with all that, dude.

609
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,938
My mustache?

610
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,638
Yeah, shave it off and
then you can come back.

611
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,006
God, come give me a hug, man, at least.

612
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,558
- Stop.
- Show your boy some love.

613
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,709
- Stop.
- Oh.

614
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:39,708
I knew it, God damn it.

615
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:41,048
I knew you were staying
at that guy's house.

616
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,379
His name's Owen.

617
00:57:42,381 --> 00:57:44,168
I don't give a shit what his name is.

618
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,348
Do you know how long you've been gone?

619
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:46,288
You tell me, asshole.

620
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,338
Hey, watch your mouth.

621
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,408
It's been weeks.

622
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,360
What do you care?

623
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,488
Excuse me?

624
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,633
You've never given a shit about me.

625
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:56,711
Say the same for you.

626
00:57:57,852 --> 00:58:00,018
- Come on, let's go.
- Ow, Owen.

627
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:00,970
- Shut up.
- Owen.

628
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,868
Hey, Noah, we've
got some more deliveries.

629
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:11,828
Where you at, man?

630
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,728
Give me a call back as soon as you can.

631
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,563
All right, bye.

632
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,388
Noah, you are way late, man.

633
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,178
Okay, are you with Zooey again?

634
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,158
Give me a call.

635
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,053
All right, bye.

636
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:28,723
Yo, it's Owen.

637
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,823
I found your bike, man.

638
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:35,838
Did Taylor give you two a ride somewhere?

639
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,673
Give me a call.

640
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,563
Noah, Zooey's here.

641
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:44,825
What's going on?

642
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,896
I'm coming, kid, just hang on.

643
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,958
What do you want?

644
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,560
To break you out of here, kid.

645
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,298
Come on, let's get you out of here.

646
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,138
What about Richard?

647
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,263
Oh, I think he's preoccupied.

648
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:43,723
Hey, oh, sorry.

649
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,573
Come on.

650
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,292
What's the point?

651
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:53,266
What do you mean?

652
01:00:53,268 --> 01:00:55,318
He's just going to keep on coming back.

653
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,708
I'm not even getting any sleep,

654
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,118
just worrying about the next time he...

655
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,103
He hits you?

656
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,331
We're going to call

657
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,808
Child Protective Services or something.

658
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:12,448
I don't wanna cause anymore problems.

659
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,281
Problem?

660
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:17,283
No, no, no, you're not
causing the problem, he is.

661
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,907
Please, don't.

662
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,894
Okay, I think I know we're gonna do.

663
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,200
What do you mean?

664
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:43,523
I've got an idea, but
I need you to watch.

665
01:01:44,713 --> 01:01:45,663
What's your idea?

666
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,168
- I'm gonna fight him.
- What?

667
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,578
Yeah, come on, let's go quickly,

668
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,513
before I realize how stupid this is.

669
01:01:57,444 --> 01:01:58,527
Wait, okay.

670
01:02:25,793 --> 01:02:27,376
Eye of the tiger.

671
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,233
- Hey.
- What?

672
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:36,913
What the hell are you doing in my house?

673
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,448
I'm taking Noah with me.

674
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:40,427
Like hell you are.

675
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:42,228
You heard me.

676
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,698
You think I'm just gonna let you go?

677
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,171
Yeah.

678
01:02:45,173 --> 01:02:46,123
Are you an idiot?

679
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:48,598
Probably.

680
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,628
So let me get this straight,
you come into my house,

681
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:54,045
you try to take my kid

682
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:56,942
and you think I'm just gonna
let you walk out the door?

683
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:58,544
Why don't you try and stop me?

684
01:03:15,377 --> 01:03:16,960
Go, go, go, go, go.

685
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:23,108
Oh, shit, oh, go, go, go, go, go.

686
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:26,530
There's the car, there's
the car right there.

687
01:03:27,509 --> 01:03:29,264
Where's my keys?

688
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,245
Why'd you make me watch that?

689
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:45,297
I needed a witness.

690
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,693
Now I need a payphone.

691
01:04:05,038 --> 01:04:06,922
911.

692
01:04:37,018 --> 01:04:39,298
What a day, huh?

693
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,133
Yeah.

694
01:04:43,811 --> 01:04:46,328
I never thought

695
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,728
I'd get my first black eye this way.

696
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:50,288
First?

697
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,123
Yeah.

698
01:04:52,015 --> 01:04:53,468
It doesn't surprise me.

699
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,420
What do you mean?

700
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,213
I wouldn't want to be the
guy who gets hit by you.

701
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,283
Hey,

702
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:16,790
I'm thinking about buying
some land out in the valley.

703
01:05:21,697 --> 01:05:26,138
Either you can help me get it started...

704
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,700
Do you want me to work
for you or something?

705
01:05:27,702 --> 01:05:28,785
No, no, no,

706
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:37,473
you could come help do some chores.

707
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:43,889
You're asking me to move in with you?

708
01:05:43,891 --> 01:05:46,383
No, what, you crazy?

709
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:55,793
Yeah, I am actually.

710
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:58,853
Yeah.

711
01:06:03,105 --> 01:06:03,938
Okay,

712
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,758
but no talking during my alien movies.

713
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,998
You and those damn movies, dude.

714
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,700
You'll grow to love them, watch.

715
01:06:16,058 --> 01:06:16,946
Is that so?

716
01:06:16,948 --> 01:06:19,281
Mm-hmm, just give it time.

717
01:06:23,348 --> 01:06:24,181
You okay?

718
01:06:25,888 --> 01:06:26,721
Yeah.

719
01:06:27,978 --> 01:06:28,811
Sure?

720
01:06:30,894 --> 01:06:31,977
I think so.

721
01:07:27,204 --> 01:07:28,500
Let's go.

722
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,518
What time is it?

723
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,458
It doesn't matter.

724
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,588
Let's go.

725
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:33,423
Why?

726
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,278
Wake up.

727
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,111
Through the window?

728
01:08:36,304 --> 01:08:38,493
This summer with you,

729
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,733
it's been awesome.

730
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,490
For awesome.

731
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:07,317
So I'll see you tomorrow?

732
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,208
Yeah.

733
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,042
See ya.

734
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:12,323
Bye, Noah.

735
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,300
No, no, no, no, no.

736
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:30,938
Dear,
Noah, I wasn't really sure

737
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,608
what to put down here,

738
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:34,858
but I knew that I had to say something,

739
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,362
even if I couldn't directly.

740
01:10:38,889 --> 01:10:43,889
Goodbyes have never been hard
for me, but this one hurts,

741
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,850
and I hope that you
won't hold it against me.

742
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,198
When Taylor and I came out here,

743
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,300
I didn't think I'd end up meeting anybody,

744
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,930
and there was this stupid
boy who broke into my room.

745
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:11,508
Well, that's everything.

746
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,341
All right.

747
01:11:12,343 --> 01:11:13,658
Being
with you has made my time here

748
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:15,702
really, really special,

749
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,263
but it also makes what's about
to happen so much harder,

750
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,618
because I think that, in some kind of way,

751
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,112
I feel like maybe I love you.

752
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:45,670
Maybe in a while, you and Owen
could check on Taylor for me.

753
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:48,038
Give him some time,

754
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,378
but I know he'll need somebody to talk to,

755
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,023
somebody that really knows.

756
01:12:25,191 --> 01:12:27,608
Goodbye, Noah, and thank you.

757
01:12:29,566 --> 01:12:30,648
Yours, Zooey.
