00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,493
Greetings sir.
-You must save us.

3
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,668
Greetings sir.
- How did this happen?

4
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,599
What happened, Subbu?

5
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:57,002
The new ACP has baton charged.
Ravi is very serious.

6
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,177
This wouldn't have happened
if you were in town.

7
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,676
Who is that ACP?

8
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:01,845
ACP Ratnam.

9
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,610
He is police officerfor namesake.
But he is a rowdy.

10
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:10,016
He does everything illegal.
He is corrupt to the core.

11
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,685
He will do anything for money.
Very arrogant.

12
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,695
Awomaniserto boot.

13
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,096
He is little clever.
That's why he is still in office.

14
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,868
Since we don't have permission
for our caste meeting,

15
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,036
He ordered baton charge.

16
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:33,309
iDream

17
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,374
He should die.

18
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,047
Boys, kill him.
-Wait Suryam.

19
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,308
Why?

20
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,283
You are our caste leader.

21
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,214
4 lakh people are behind you.

22
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,783
Don't take any hasty decisions.

23
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,727
We must think & strike.
He is an ACP.

24
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,796
He must be handled legally.

25
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,065
First, speak to Home Minister.

26
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,640
Hello, what's happening?

27
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,573
You won because of our votes
and now ordered to hit us?

28
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,411
Who is that ACP?
Elections are not too far.

29
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,751
4 lakh votes.
Don't forget that.

30
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:20,752
Caste away all the evil
eyes fallen on him.

31
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,087
Our enemies are very angry.

32
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,593
Where is Madhu?

33
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,089
She has gone on a tour.

34
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,767
How many times l told you not to send
her out without my permission?

35
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,264
lt was organised suddenly in college.

36
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,600
l informed him to inform about this
when you went forthe meeting.

37
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,936
Didn't you tell him?
- Sorry, l forgot.

38
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,371
What will she do
becoming a doctor?

39
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,707
Why do you get angry?

40
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,678
Wait for a year and
she'll finish her studies.

41
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,443
Which place?
-Araku.

42
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,548
Give medicines to all patients.

43
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,957
How is your health?

44
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,454
How will he understand
if you speak in Hindi?

45
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,963
Now watch my Telugu language.
Spit it out.

46
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,302
We are leaving to Hyderabad
in another 2 hours.

47
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,972
Sir, are we eloping so soon?

48
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,302
Madhu, your upper cloth is flying away.

49
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,242
Where did Madhu go?
- Let's search overthere.

50
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,685
There she is.

51
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,685
What are you doing here?

52
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:01,860
lt's getting late. Let's go.

53
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,859
Look how beautiful this place is.

54
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,368
l wish l could stay here always.

55
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,469
That cuckoo is cooing in
a romantic mood.

56
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:20,368
lf we coo back and if it likes
our voice, it will answer us.

57
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,147
Really?
-Yes. Listen now.

58
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,382
Monkey is the right choice foryou.

59
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,952
Madhu, you do it.
- Do it.

60
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,403
Do you like my voice?

61
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,103
l don't love strangers.

62
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,777
lt was forthe cuckoo & not foryou.

63
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,280
Don't humans love you?

64
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:40,622
Who is he?

65
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,355
The cuckoo you mentioned just now.

66
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,628
Darling, will you divorce her & marry me?

67
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,471
Why are you teasing them?

68
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,975
lf not now, when will you enjoy.
-Yes.

69
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,305
Drag herto the party.

70
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:05,644
Come.
- Leave me. l won't come.

71
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,151
You must say ''l Love You''
to anyone you see now.

72
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,589
Me? Never. l won't.

73
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:12,922
Okay, forget it.

74
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,094
l thought you would become a great
doctor if you say ''l love you''.

75
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,162
Looks like it won't happen.
- Stop talking like that.

76
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,925
ls it wrong to think that you
would become a great doctor?

77
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,503
Whatever she says comes true.
- Common say it.

78
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,177
Shit! Don't you have any work other
than saying ''l Love You''?

79
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,583
What happened?
- lt's him again.

80
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:44,218
lt's all because of you.
- Look there girls.

81
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,360
You are beautiful, darling.

82
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,196
How could you go away just like that?

83
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,296
l too love you.

84
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,863
Just give me a kiss.

85
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,767
Just one kiss.

86
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:04,040
How could you hide yourself?
Look at me, my girl.

87
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:07,212
Show me yourface.
- Drive fast.

88
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,981
Driver, stop the bus.

89
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,658
What is it?

90
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,899
l will teach you a lesson. Come.

91
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,569
Don't you have any sense?
We were just joking.

92
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,569
Move. We both have to
open up our hearts.

93
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,072
What does he want to open?
-Just shut up.

94
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,075
Sorry grandfather.
l was just joking.

95
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,746
Even l thought the same way.

96
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,245
But some girls like variety.

97
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:49,354
Saying that some girls like old men,
he brought me here.

98
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:54,820
What?

99
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,925
Do you want to make trouble?

100
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,089
Who is making trouble?
You & me?

101
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,764
You say ''l love you'' to every
passerby on road.

102
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,591
Don't you have any shame?

103
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,199
What are you?
Girls or ghosts?

104
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,767
How dare you call me trouble maker!

105
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,546
Get up.

106
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:15,609
This is my seat.

107
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,780
Did you bring this from home?
- No. l paid Rs. 200 to T.T.

108
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,453
l've got a confirmed ticket.
Get up.

109
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,951
T.T. has cheated me.

110
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,959
Your name is Pentaiah.
-Yeah.

111
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,635
Are you 48?
-Any doubt?

112
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,295
Do l look like an idiot?

113
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,633
l would say my age is 80
if you were an idiot.

114
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,969
lt's true that my age is 48.

115
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,145
What is your age?
- 50.

116
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,644
Stop joking.
Why lie infront of girls?

117
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,307
You must be around 35.
Moreover girls are staring at you.

118
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,322
She might even say you
''l love you''

119
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,492
You are used to it, aren't you?

120
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,157
He is torturing me.

121
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,827
Why do you trouble her
for such silly things?

122
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,993
My seat.
- lt's behind you. Come.

123
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,233
He doesn't believe that
my name is Pentaiah.

124
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,103
Even l won't believe you.
-Why?

125
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,001
Pentaiah is my brother.

126
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,181
l told him to cancel the ticket.
But he sold it to you.

127
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,440
ldiot!

128
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,843
l pulled my own legs.

129
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,852
What happened?

130
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,026
Where are you going?

131
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,196
What happened?

132
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,795
l missed the bag which contains
ourtickets & money.

133
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,370
Pentaiah might help us.
Shall we ask him for help?

134
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,607
You go & bring him.

135
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,442
Come.
-Very urgent?

136
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:07,548
Please show us something...
- She's punjabi, doesn't know telugu.

137
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:13,490
We lost ourtickets.
Save us from the T.T.

138
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,392
Okay. What is your name?

139
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:18,968
Why should l tell you?

140
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,565
Then why should l help you?
- Tell him.

141
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,074
Kanthamma.
-What?

142
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,575
lf you can be Pentaiah,
can't l be Kanthamma?

143
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,738
What is your name?
- Pichamma.

144
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:37,680
You said you're a Punjabi.
-Athamma singh.

145
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,756
All of you go to the bathroom.
-Why?

146
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,519
Do as l say. Go.

147
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,099
Why did squeeze all into
the bathroom?- Keep quiet.

148
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,099
Who is inside?
- Move.

149
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,431
ls it you Pentaiah?
-Yes sir.

150
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,609
Carry on.

151
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,278
Saw how l managed it.

152
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,276
What if the T.T. comes back
once we go out?

153
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,448
Show him the tickets.

154
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,117
How is it possible?
Tickets are in the missing bag.

155
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,286
ls this your missing bag?

156
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,290
Greetings sir.

157
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,705
ls he short-sighted?

158
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:35,336
iDream

159
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,380
Was he sleeping till now?

160
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:38,809
What is it?

161
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,816
My name is Bunny.
l am from Vizag.

162
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,917
Did you come from Vizag to say this?

163
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,549
Recommendation letter?

164
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,988
To Respected Appala Naidu...

165
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,494
Did you think l will say this.

166
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,327
l will slap you.
You're not so great.

167
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,997
You will come up only if you stop
sleeping with your eyes wide open.

168
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,009
A small obligation.

169
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,178
He is a very good boy.

170
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,677
My relative.

171
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,516
He is an orphan.

172
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,514
He got admission in MBA.

173
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,846
He wants to work & study.

174
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,522
So, give him a good job.

175
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,691
My recommendation is very high.

176
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,860
After reading the letter,
he will look at you.

177
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:27,862
Give him a smile.

178

ls that idiot still alive?

180
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,709
My life got ruined because of him.

181
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,209
During my school days,
he squeezed me into pulp.

182
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,048
l've come to this level after
a lot of hard work.

183
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,708
l would've given you job if you
hadn't come with his letter.

184
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,388
Now, no job foryou. Get out.

Sir, medical college gang is back.

189
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,737
When they were teasing girls,
l objected them and they hit me.

190
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,406
They have become a daily menace.

191
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,248
l will take care of them.

192
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,746
You refused to offer me a job
on seeing the letter.

193
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,418
Atleast look at my skills
and offer me a job.

What skills?

195
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:29,920
Why are you closing your ears?

196
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,760

197
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,593
Fight & music?
- Keep watching.

198
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,596
Looks like you are teasing girls.

199
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,755
lnstead of exhibiting yourfighting skills,
you are getting beaten up.

200
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,082
Sorry sir. There are no batteries
in the walkman.

201
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,793

202
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:02,619

Victory is a must in a contest.

00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,197
They must get admitted in hospital.

213
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,266
Beat them like a mega star.

214
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,769

355
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,003
Why are you getting angry?

356
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,671
Boy friends are very common these days.

357
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:44,933
Boy friends for her!
She is a book worm.

358
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:50,943
Yes. My education is more important
than love & marriage.

359
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:56,348
ls that it?
- No. My father is a caste fanatic.

360
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,753
lf he comes to know that l'm in love,

361
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,523
He will stop my studies and marry me off.

362
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,132
Never again talk about
this topic, okay?

363
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:24,105
ln today program,
let's find out what the youth thinks.

364
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:27,543

368
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,222
Your name?

369
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,218
Tell me about yourfamily.

370
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,727
Mother, father, sisters, brothers.
l have none of them.

371
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,459
What?
- l have none.

372
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,724
So, you are an orphan.

373
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,227
How could you be so happy
while saying that?

374
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,564
Should l cry?

375
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,571
Only when there is no one for me
in this world, l should feel sad.

376
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,743
l don't have that problem.

377
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,344
Because people of this state
are my relatives.

378
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,576
Your opinion on love?

379
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:03,246
Your opinion on friendship
between boys & girls?

380
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,987
Their intentions would be different.

381
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,090
They shake hands to be friends
and do all sorts of nonsense.

382
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,261
Nevertrust such friendship.

383
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,265
Would you like to give any message
to any of yourfriends?

384
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,359
l will give a message to my enemy.

385
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,593
Hey Kanthamma...!

386
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,531
Where are you?

387
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,435
You made me lose Rs. 4000
and escaped.

388
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,109
l won't leave you this time.

389
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,542
Your studies will get stopped abruptly.

390
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,442
You will get married to
someone you hate.

391
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:35,380
Your husband will drink and
kick you every night.

392
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,781
Your mother-in-law will be a devil,
your children will be little brats

393
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,948
and you will face all kinds
of torture. This is my curse!

394
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,630
Kanthamma, why fight with him?
Return his money.

395
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,962
What should youngsters
do to be happy?

396
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,471

00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,737
Beating 3 is very easy.

533
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,041
Come in 4's.

534
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,132
l can save time.

535
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,430
The other day you said you
can't fight without music.

536
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,156
Music is not necessary to fight.

537
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,299
A mood to fight is enough.

538
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,451
Just another minute is left.

539
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:46,088
Get 2 more guys.
l will beat you all.

540
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,751
Come.

541
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,323
Why are you crying?

542
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,392
A girl took away your bike.

543
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,534
l came to tell you but you hit me.
- She escaped again.

544
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,762
Sir, your daughter is coming.

545
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:39,801
Where are you coming from?

546
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,568
From college.

547
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:42,879
Go.

548
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,444
lnquire about the boy...

549
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,819
The girl who ran away
without giving money

550
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,819
has given money.
- Really?

551
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:54,452
There she is.

552
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:57,918
Good.

553
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,554
Bunny, a small help.
-What is it?

554
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,961
My sweetheart Shanthi stopped
talking to me for a week.

555
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,101
Please keep this letter in
her book. Just once.

556
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,702
How do l look like to you?

557
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,429
Please.
- Do l have to do this too?

558
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,972
Please...you will keep the
letter unnoticed.

559
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,643
Please buddy.
-Who?

560
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:14,776
The girl in blue churidhar.

561
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,745
Please.
- Oh! My customer.

562
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,644
Give it.
- Thanks.

563
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:23,376
Hi Kanthamma!

564
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:24,986
l have given the money.

565
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:25,914
So, don't come to me.

566
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,091
You talk well.
But your pizza is like shit.

567
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,522
Was it yesterday's or
day before yesterday's?

568
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,330
Everything in our shop is fresh...
just like you.

569
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:37,923
lsn't it?

570
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:41,532
Eat.

571
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:43,530
l will leave.

572
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,033
Father will scold me if l go late.

573
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,114
Buddy, you kept my love letter
in the wrong book

574
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:55,944
And she is going.

575
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:58,450
Hey Kanthamma...

576
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,020
My letter..?

577
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:03,355
lt is just a letter.
We can see to it tomorrow.

578
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,363
Your Sambar is the tastiest one.

579
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,156
Madhu, l want to talk to you.

580
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:11,690
Finish your dinner & come.

581
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:15,738
You eat.

582
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:22,178
Father...

583
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,110
His name is Arvind,
Deputy Commissioner of Police.

584
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:33,084
He is the richest man in our caste.

585
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,255
He agreed to marry you
on seeing your photo.

586
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:39,662
The marriage is on 10th
of next month. Go.

587
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,729
There are only 20 days
left forthe marriage.

588
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,929
We must send invitations
to our people in Delhi.

589
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:48,669
No one should be left out.

590
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:50,267
Make the arrangements.

591
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,970
Why all of a sudden?

592
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,540
What was my mistake?

593
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:03,515
Didn't you commit any mistake?

594
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,687
Where did you see herthe other day?

595
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,884
She was going with a boy on
a bike near Nagarjun Circle.

596
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,131
We have nothing between us.

597
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,397
The other day in Pizza hut...

598
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:23,429
How did this love letter
sneak into your book?

599
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,537
l swear l don't know.

600
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,974
Believe me. Please.

601
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,713
Stop beating a grown up girl.

602
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,143
Don't poke your nose in our matter.

603
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,418
lf people in our caste marries
someone else in other caste,

604
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:37,917
l will lose only one vote.

605
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,080
lf my daughter marries someone
else in other caste,

606
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,650
l will lose a lakh votes.

607
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,062
Listen to me...
- Shut up.

608
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:47,954
This marriage will happen.

609
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,999
No more studies.

610
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:03,472
ls all your hardwork a waste?

611
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:09,979
lf l get the one who kept
the letter in your book...

612
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,321
Have you organised a meeting?

613
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,255
Get up.

614
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:19,493
Move.

615
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,702
Yesterday, l kept a letter in
your book by mistake.

616
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,427
lt is not foryou. lt is for Shanthi.
Give it to her.

617
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:28,562
Vijay gave it foryou.

618
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:42,015
iDream

619
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,859
l don't understand what you are saying.

620
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:50,957
Anyone tell me.

621
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:52,889
What bloody should l tell you!

622
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,928
You have ruined my life.

623
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,675
lf this marriage happens,
l will die.

624
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,281
Then you will understand
how big your mistake is.

625
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,960
l never expected this to go so far.

626
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,031
Very sorry...

627
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,903
lf your studies are getting
ruined because of me,

628
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,635
lt is my responsibility
to stop this marriage.

629
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,852
Don't get tensed.

630
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,146
Conducting a marriage
is very tough.

631
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:54,186
But stopping is very easy.
Who is the groom?

632
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,453
Somebody Arvind,
Deputy Commissioner of Police.

633
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,290
DCP Arvind...?

634
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,024
No. He is an encounter specialist.

635
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,064
lt's not as easy as beating
few college students.

636
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,700
He uses gun like a pen.

637
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,561
l've a superb idea.

638
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,270
Shall we spread rumour
that DCP has AlDS?

639
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,341
Enough of your outdated ideas.

640
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,316
ls it DCP Arvind?

641
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:26,277
My name is Bunny.

642
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,817
l want to meet you personally.

643
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,391
What will you say after going inside?

644
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:36,966
l don't know.

645
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:38,727
But l must stop this marriage.

646
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:39,896
That's the only thing l know.

647
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,433
Buddy...
-Yes.

648
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,068
lf something goes wrong,
what remains is a dead body.

649
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,569
Don't worry. You will be fine.

650
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,807
l was talking about you, idiot.

651
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,412
lt's all because of you.

652
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,984
Wait for 5 minutes. He will come.
- Okay.

653
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:08,623
Give me a missed call
if something goes wrong.

654
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:20,674
Where is the old city gang?

655
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:26,680
Proud to be goons!

656
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:30,042
l will kill you if you repeat this.

657
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,150
And you...?
- l called you...

658
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:38,827
What for?

659
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,652
l said l wanted to talk to you.

660
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:46,535
What's the matter?

661
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:50,201
The one who is going to
marry Madhumathi...

662
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,173
lt's me, of course.

663
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,575
What's the matter?

664
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:01,342
Actually...

665
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,580
l've no time.

666
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:10,618
Cancel this marriage.

667
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:15,627
What did you say?

668
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,566
What did you say? Tell me.

669
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,866
Why should this marriage be stopped?

670
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,004
Are you trying to stop my marriage?

671
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:26,968
Why did you say that?

672
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,779
Why shouldn't l marry Madhumathi?

673
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:33,677
There must be a reason.

674
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,148
Tell me the reason.

675
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,050
Will you tell me or not?

676
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,257
l & Madhumathi are in love.

677
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,727
How dare you love the girl
l am going to marry?

678
00:52:51,635 --> 00:53:00,509
Don't kill me. l beg you.
- How dare you love my fiance?

679
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:08,575
What do you do?

680
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,448
Pizza delivery...- Pizza delivery boy?

681
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,065
Do you know how rich she is?

682
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,805
l will make her my queen.

683
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,567
But you...shit!

684
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:38,979
l will marry her no matter
what so everyou may say.

685
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,779
Do anything you like.

686
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:46,914
Marry her.

687
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,387
You marry her.

688
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,456
But she will die the moment
you marry her.

689
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,997
l will also die with Madhumathi.

690
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:03,765
Then l will also die.

691
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:10,437
l can't live without her.

692
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,049
l'm late forthe next delivery.

693
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:40,575
iDream

694
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,348
Did the plan work out?

695
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,950
DCP was stunned by my performance.

696
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,281
You told him about your love. Fine.

697
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,981
Did you tell her about that?
-Why should l tell her?

698
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,322
What if the DCP inquires her?

699
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,267
Oh my God! DCP is here.

700
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:13,039
Will you call Madhumathi,
3rd year student to come here?

701
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:13,709
And you...?

702
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,974
Tell herthat herfiance has come.

703
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:33,460
A big clash broke out in Ameerpet.
Come immediately.

704
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,855
2 men are already dead.

705

lt's urgent sir.

706
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,463

l won't come to college
from tomorrow.

708
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,971
Can't you continue your
studies after marriage?

709
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,072
They didn't agree to it.

710
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:58,314
Someone is here foryou, Madhu.
-Who?

711
00:55:58,822 --> 00:55:59,686
Yourfiance.

712
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:05,184
Him..?.

713
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:09,699
Did you say you're my fiance?

714
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,030
Why would l say that?

715
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:11,991
Then, what did you say?

716
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,963
l said we are just lovers.
-What?

717
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,471
Lovers?

718
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,674
Are you mad?

719
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:19,975
Don't shout.

720
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:21,507
DCP will kill us if he knows this.

721
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,576
Did you say this to that DCP too?

722
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,976
l told that DCP only.

723
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,042
DCP..?

724
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,277
You lunatic.

725
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:30,784
Why did you say that?

726
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:35,520
l didn't know how to stop your marriage.

727
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:36,952
So, l said that we are in love.

728
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,659
lf DCP asks you,
tell him that we are lovers.

729
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,823
Should l say that l love you?

730
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,297
Your marriage will be stopped
only if you say that.

731
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,600
lf you don't say that,
he will kill me.

732
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:49,197
l won't say that.

733
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,268
lf you don't say that...

734
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,941
Damn it! How dare they lie to me?

735
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:57,742
l will call you later.

736
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:16,788
Do you love him?

737
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:21,970
l am asking you.

738
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,706
Since when?

739
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:27,906
Since 5 years.

740
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,244
Then why don't you get married?

741
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,408
l want to marry after completing my studies.

742
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,047
You could have said this before.

743
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:44,860
l feel insulted.

744
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,055
l used to dream a lot.

745
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,526
l bought 100 silk sarees from Kanchi.

746
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,967
l will sell them foryou if you want.

747
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:54,600
Does yourfather know about this?

748
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,102
He can't understand.

749
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,208
l told you because you are a gentleman.
-Who said that l am a gentleman?

750
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,143
l'm not a gentleman.

751
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:22,456
Shall l tell yourfatherthat
the letter was for me?

752
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,530
lt's of no use.

753
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,400
l'm scared about what would
that DCP tell my father.

754
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,770
How dare they!

755
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,340
Everyone has insulted me.

756
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,177
l've lost my honour.

757
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,814
l will chop them into pieces.

758
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,174
l will kill them.

759
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,114
Be cool.
-What cool!

760
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,820
l am very angry forthe humiliation.

761
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,422
What happened?
Why are you shouting?

762
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,286
DCP is not interested
in this marriage.

763
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:53,854
Why?

764
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:54,629
Who knows?

765
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,363
He didn't tell me the reason no matter
how many times l asked him.

766
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:11,572
Father!

767
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,577
l'll say one thing if you
promise not to get angry.

768
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:17,082
Go ahead.

769
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,088
The letter wasn't for me.

770
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,418
Her boyfriend wrote the letterfor her.

771
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,593
With those books...
- Shut up!

772
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:31,597
Go away. l mustn't see you
again with my daughter.

773
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:40,602
Father...anyway the marriage
is cancelled.

774
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:44,779
You know it wasn't my mistake.

775
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,779
Can l go to college from tomorrow?

776
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,616
Please father.
- Go.

777
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,329
What is it Kanthamma?
You look very happy.

778
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:36,825
ls your marriage cancelled?

779
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:42,671
Can't you say thanks for it?
-Why should l?

780
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,999
You made the mistake
and rectified it.

781
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,011
This reaction for nothing!

782
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:52,839
He placed real gun on my forehead,
you know that?

783
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,516
How brilliantly l escaped!

784
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,377
Who?

785
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,042
Our DCP!

786
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,046
He's inviting us to have lunch
with him in Gandipet.

787
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,048
l'll not come.
- Good!

788
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,882
Policemen are generally suspicious,

789
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,887
if he comes to know the truth,
your marriage will be fixed,

790
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:37,218
l'll not come then.

791
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,561
l'll come.
- l'll not come.

792
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,240
l shouldn't have behaved
like that yesterday.

793
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:05,417
l meet only thieves, rogues, liars,
it has hardened me.

794
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,594
No problem sir,
you've understood our love.

795
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:16,594
That's enough.

796
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:23,272
Do you know Bunny very well?

797
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:28,102
Just 4 like you are enough to spoil
the lives of Andhra girls.

798
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,775
How did you both meet?

799
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,285
Nothing like that sir, l'll tell you.

800
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:46,625
lt was on a deepavali day,

801
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:51,300
l was sitting dull on the road after
a Pizza order got cancelled,

802
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,970
l heard a girl's laugh,

803
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,137
l was taken by her voice and wishing
to see her beautiful face l turned,

804
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,645
l saw a girl getting down from car
with few kids in the dark,

805
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,820
She lighted a flower pot,

806
01:03:13,689 --> 01:03:17,489
in the flower pot's light...
the girl's legs...

807
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:21,830
...her waist...

808
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,501
...her neck...

809
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,001
...when l was about to see herface...

810
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,176
Madhumathi!
- lt's Keerthi reddy, you fool!

811
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:38,343
Police are very clever.

812
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,175
Just tell them the scene,
they'll understand everything.

813
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,180
He's narrating a scene from
the film 'Tholiprema',

814
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,512
and this man is enjoying
it as real.

815
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:48,520
Don't you watch films sir?

816
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,194
Films are full of lies!

817
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,197
ls it sir?

818
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,525
Then, temple scene,
a scene in smoke,

819
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,530
airport scene,
there are many scenes sir.

820
01:04:03,406 --> 01:04:05,203
Just one scene!

821
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:19,415

No man's land...

824
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:35,696
Don't jump O maiden...

825
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:38,703
My man is clever...

826
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:45,040
Come...come...come once...

827
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:57,718

828
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,057
Mischievous young man...

829
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:04,563
He intruded...

831
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,451
Why are you displaying your beauty?

832
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,625
lf a handsome is near me,
it's natural...

833
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,953
You can't escape from
coming out today...

01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:10,132

Your beauty and youth

Don't stare at me,

Whatever it is,
this night is festival of love...

01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:27,206
l'm all yours and
let's have fun...

844
01:07:49,772 --> 01:07:50,898
What are you thinking?

845
01:07:51,607 --> 01:07:52,733
Are you not interested?

846
01:07:54,443 --> 01:07:57,742
You think betterthan me
when you're cool.

847
01:07:58,614 --> 01:07:59,911
Okay, l'll take leave now.

848
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:09,591
What is it father?

849
01:08:09,858 --> 01:08:12,918
l was sad forthat DCP's rejection.

850
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:15,423
You too felt sad for me.

851
01:08:17,299 --> 01:08:23,260
Did you feel sad or not?
-Yes.

852
01:08:23,472 --> 01:08:24,769
You don't worry,

853
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:27,442
you'll get married on the
same day l had fixed.

854
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:32,440
Groom is my friend
Subba Rao's son Venu.

855
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:35,609
He's wealthierthan DCP.

856
01:08:35,818 --> 01:08:37,615
Only thing is he's uneducated.

857
01:08:39,655 --> 01:08:41,953
Father.
-What dear?

858
01:08:42,658 --> 01:08:44,626
What have l done now?

859
01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:48,622
Why are you arranging
my marriage again?

860
01:08:49,665 --> 01:08:55,626
No dear, l told everyone about
your marriage on 10th.

861
01:08:56,505 --> 01:08:57,972
if your marriage doesn't happen,

862
01:08:58,173 --> 01:09:01,301
we'll lose ourface and honour
among our caste people.

863
01:09:02,344 --> 01:09:04,972
Will you stop my marriage
for it, father?

864
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:08,638
Why are you again insisting on studies?

865
01:09:08,851 --> 01:09:10,318

Father, l'll not agree.
-Won't agree?

867

lf you don't l'll kill you.

868
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:21,655
This marriage will happen.

869
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:24,828
How dare you bite me!
Kill it boys!

870
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,498
Don't harm it.
l'll obey you.

871
01:09:30,873 --> 01:09:34,331
Subba Rao doesn't like his
daughter-in-law to study.

872
01:09:46,722 --> 01:09:49,350
l don't know why you
refused my daughter,

873
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:53,858
l'm getting her married on the
same day l had fixed foryou.

You're getting the first invitation.

875
01:09:56,398 --> 01:09:58,696
lt has time and venue
of the marriage.

876
01:09:58,901 --> 01:10:01,369
Stay away from the place on that day.

877
01:10:02,404 --> 01:10:03,530

01:12:09,364 --> 01:12:10,831
Kill him in an encounter.

01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:48,859
Once l killed 5 people
in an encounter.

01:13:37,452 --> 01:13:39,079
Why did you bring us to
the registrar's office?

918
01:13:39,788 --> 01:13:40,755
You both are marrying now.

919

This is injustice sir.

920
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,420
This is injustice.

921
01:13:47,629 --> 01:13:49,597
ls it a joke to marry
all of a sudden?

922
01:13:49,865 --> 01:13:54,268
lf you don't marry Madhu now,
you'll lose herforever.

923
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:57,768
Just sign it, l'll take care
of otherthings.

Why?

926
01:14:00,142 --> 01:14:01,268
Because we are not...

927
01:14:02,144 --> 01:14:04,942
l'll talk to him,
you don't give him any tension.

928
01:14:07,149 --> 01:14:09,777
Give us 5 minutes time.
