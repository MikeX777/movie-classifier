SYNDROME: SET OF SYMPTOMS
THAT CHARACTERIZE AN ILLNESS

3
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,812
Well, Victor,
we have the test results.

4
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,353
And I called because
you wanted me to be

5
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,685
frank with you.

6
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,783
In the images
one can clearly see

7
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:38,386
the advanced growth
of the tumor.

8
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,126
Given its location,
the possibilities

9
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:45,898
for intervention, as we
discussed, are zero.

10
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,372
Under these conditions
you cannot expect to live

11
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,944
more than one or two months.

12
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:58,344
SYNDROME

13
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,231
See? See?

14
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,464
All right then.

ABSTINENCE SYNDROME:

THE DEPRIVATION OF THAT
TO WHICH ONE IS ADDICTED

17
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,697
What is it?
Really, what is it?

18
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,870
- AG-string.
- You knew... you idiot.

19
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,336
I didn't see a thing.

20
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,202
What colour is it?

21
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,243
What colour is it, or what
colour would I like it to be?

22
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,574
What colour.

23
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,975
You've got no idea.

24
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,085
Black.

25
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,063
You're an idiot.

26
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,666
Alex, you know you look
a lot like Dad?

27
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,903
No.

28
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,072
DEPENDENCE

29
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,625
I'll leave you
the keys, Alex?

30
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,264
Are you taking yours?

31
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,936
I can only see these.

32
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,697
Get a copy made.

33
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,478
Coca Cola and an apple.

34
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,113
And see if he's there, okay?

35
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,426
Just a second.

36
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,059
Ciao.

37
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,234
COMPULSION

38
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,971
Pull and m assage it, right?

39
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,345
Lock by lock since it's dry...
so it penetrates.

40
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,711
What are you doing?

41
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,254
- What are you laughing at?
- How should I know?

42
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,787
Is it nitwit's day today?

43
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,157
You're so cute,
we're hung up on you.

44
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,025
Yeah, right.

45
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,623
You're leaving?

46
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,563
- Yes.
- Give mea kiss.

47
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,762
- Will you do the till?
- okay.

48
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:20,567
Ciao.

49
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,542
Are you sure?

50
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,208
Don't worry,
just do me a favour.

51
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,218
Go and see if there's a guy
dressed in black, and tell me.

52
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,779
Ciao.

53
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,633
He wanted a shag or something.

54
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,868
He's funny, and sweet.

55
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,035
I've just got 4,000 pesetas,
but I want two pills.

56
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,909
Two pills and a Smiley.

57
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,441
- Hold on.
- You want some mushrooms?

58
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,383
Careful.
Shit, girl.

59
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,841
I'm going to clean the table.

60
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,936
I can't stand the smell, okay?

61
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,394
What? What?

62
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,581
I'm going to bed, Alex.

63
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,684
Tomorrow, we'll see, okay?

64
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,326
Good night.

65
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,731
Once upon a time
there was a boy and a girl,

66
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,867
a brother and a sister,
called Hansel and Gretel.

67
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,284
And they lived
with their parents,

68
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:25,323
until one day
their father went

69
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:31,385
to the forest to hunt...
and never returned.

70
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,070
So the two children,
Hansel and Gretel,

71
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,472
were left alone
with their mother.

72
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,479
But the mother
loved the father so much,

73
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:54,581
that she took no notice
of the children.

74
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:00,621
She gave them no water,
she gave them no food,

75
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,786
she didn't keep them warm
at night.

76
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,161
She didn't care for them,
she didn't read them stories.

77
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,633
And the children had to
love each other,

78
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,705
and take good care
of each other.

79
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,207
They got thinner and thinner,
and hungrier and hungrier,

80
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,574
and m ore and more
in need of affection,

81
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,773
so both of them decided
to leave home

82
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,943
and look for something
wonderful,

83
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:32,183
and someone to
give them the love

84
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,624
they weren't being given.

85
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,969
It's all right.

86
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,710
I'm not pregnant.

87
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,483
Show me you love me.

88
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,592
Look at me.
We've gone insane.

89
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,497
This can't happen.
It can't.

90
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,518
I don't want to follow you.

91
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,089
No.

92
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,424
I'm looking.

93
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,300
I'm looking at you.
Be yourself.

94
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,466
Whatever the cost,
above all else.

95
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,173
You won't lose
if you are yourself.

96
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:21,309
You will die when you want
if you are yourself.

97
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,217
Change is within.

98
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,516
Alone.

99
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,420
With fear...

100
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,425
and pain.

101
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,087
Open your eyes.

102
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,687
Wake up.

103
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,968
No.

104
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,960
I am a m an.

105
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,195
Here and now..

106
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,134
WANT

107
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,777
- I haven't got it now.
- Why?

108
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,936
Hang on.

109
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,480
Why?

110
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,348
Not now, I sold what I had.

111
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:14,289
That's a lie.
Your nose will grow.

112
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,260
No, really.
I don't have it.

113
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,327
Shall we take a walk?
Have a drink somewhere?

114
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,263
At home?

115
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,301
Do you fancy that?

116
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,893
Who's at home?

117
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,995
Nobody.

118
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,701
I'll have a glass of water
and then you can walk me.

119
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,107
Water?

120
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,508
Yes.

121
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,911
Okay, I've got some water
you're going to like.

122
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,574
I've never been up there,
have I, Willy?

123
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,676
What floor is it?

124
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,585
The fiirst.

125
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,590
So it's perfect for
failed suicides.

126
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,284
Yeah.

127
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,352
Is that your room?

128
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,082
Play the piano.

129
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,340
I'm hungry.

130
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,073
Chocolate.

131
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,417
Do you think I'm pretty?

132
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,520
Very,.

133
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,750
Yeah, and clever?

134
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,517
Not especially.

135
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,402
I can't help thinking
about that baby..

136
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:26,815
I did it yesterday,
and since then I've im agined

137
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,376
a baby the whole time.

138
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,184
And now, when I held you
in my arm s...

139
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,054
Can you imagine?

140
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,685
A baby that,
if it was still alive,

141
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,789
would be born, growup,
would one day be like you,

142
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,734
and I could hold it
in my arm s.

143
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:52,439
Shit, it's amazing,
one decision changes...

144
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,138
an entire life.

145
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,340
Worst thing is I can't cry...

146
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,817
I can't scream...

147
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,356
I can only piss
myself laughing,

148
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,687
laugh with pain.

149
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,153
Father... I'm sorry..

150
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,656
Everything I do is wrong.

151
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,958
Forgive me.

152
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,601
I love you.

153
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,395
I love you.

154
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,365
I love you.

155
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,398
ISOLATION

156
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,813
You want some water?

157
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,054
Do you?

158
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,462
Come, we won't let go
of each other.

159
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,596
Look, it's beautiful.

160
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,835
Hello, night.

161
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,741
Hello, night.
Hello, night star.

162
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:28,849
As a child, walking
with Dad and with you,

163
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,445
I thought you could touch
the clouds,

164
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,254
and they'd be
like cotton balls.

165
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:41,458
I'm happy here with you,
and the night.

166
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,799
Call a taxi.

167
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,569
Hold on, it's okay..

168
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,700
Relax.

169
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:57,042
We're friends,
but you don't want to see me.

170
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,242
You only come when
you feel like it.

171
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,809
You want it?
Or not?

172
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,890
Ana.

173
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,558
Ana, talk to me.

174
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:11,664
Ana.

175
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,168
Hey, are you all right?

176
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,902
Answer me.

177
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,740
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

178
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,914
He's gone.
He's gone.

179
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,869
Take it easy.

180
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,357
STOCKHOLM SYNDROME:
AN ILLNESS IN WHICH

181

THE KIDNAPPED PERSON
ENDS UP LOVING THE KIDNAPPER

00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,489
FEAR

183
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,101
Do you want me to gag you?

184
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,196
- Yes or no?
- No.

185
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,332
Okay.
Don't scream.

186
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,934
Please, leave me
this hand free.

187
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,971
Do you know me or not?

188
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,276
Do you know who I am?

189
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,816
Do you?

190
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,886
Yes.

191
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,751
Please, leave me
this hand free.

192
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,084
I'll let you go.

193
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,386
I give you something
when you give me something.

194
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:45,326
- I'm suffocating.
- You understand?

195
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,057
I give you something
when you give me something.

196
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,030
What do you want?

197
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,730
You know nothing about
me since I left.

198
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,065
You know nothing.

199
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,071
We really hurt each other.

200
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,801
We both really hurt each other.

201
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,070
I'm so sorry I left.

202
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,908
You hurt me.
I have to sort this out.

203
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,963
Going to dinner, Alex?

204
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,656
No.

205
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,865
I let you go.

206
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,564
I let you go,
it's a show of trust.

207
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,732
I don't want you to touch me
or know. Anything about you!

208
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,399
I want to go!

209
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,375
You left me in a hospital
and split.

210
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,173
You didn't care about me.

211
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,840
Not at all!

212
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,543
I want to go to the only person
that cares about me.

213
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,143
He'll be worried -
for sure he'll be worried!

214
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,654
He thinks about me.

215
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,587
And he DOES love me!

216
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,387
And he DOES want me
to be happy!

217
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,064
Let me go!
No, please!

218
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,530
Let me put this on you.

219
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,726
No, I'll be good.

220
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:03,137
If you pass the test,
I'll take it off, or not.

221
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,537
You want me to tie you up?

222
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,166
No.

223
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,608
Let me do it.

224
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,703
Please...

225
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,144
Let me go,
you fucking nutcase!

226
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,847
Let me go.
You're crazy.

227
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,228
What, you think I'm kidding?

228
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,662
If you don't do as I say,
I'll smash your face in.

229
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,672
What a shame.

230
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,208
I'm going to cry,
I'll play the waif.

231
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,437
I'll play the baby girl,
the girl in need.

232
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,705
Huh?

233
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,044
Poor thing,
abandoned her whole life.

234
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:52,089
No daddy,
with that fag brother of hers.

235
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,158
Spit in my mouth, go on!

236
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,817
I like it.

237
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:58,622
Spit inside of me.

238
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,463
Please don't hurt me.

239
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,897
Please, let me go.

240
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,565
What do you want us to play?

241
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,673
Fine, try to leave.
Try to leave.

242
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,578
Go on.
Okay, fine.

243
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,318
- No, no, no!
- No?

244
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,320
No! No!
Take it.

245
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:02,720
Let me go, please.
Please.

246
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:14,162
Let me go, please.
Please!

247
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,537
Get in the corner and shut up
unless you want me

248
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,609
to hit you again.

249
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,879
Don't ask me to release you.

250
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,884
Don't ask me to let you go.

251
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:36,091
Don't ask me anything
you know I'll say no to.

252
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,923
Have you got that?

253
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,784
She was meant to be here
at 12, right?

254
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,787
Yes, but maybe she left
a message or something.

255
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:20,260
If she doesn't turn up,
we'll call the police,

256
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,963
though I think it's nothing.

257
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,700
NECESSITY

258
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,012
Your life is shit.

259
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:55,956
Say it.

260
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,658
"My life is shit".

261
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,750
I can't take it.
I can't.

262
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,759
Give me your wrist.

263
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,056
Please, tie them in front.

264
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,598
Please, I'm asking you.
Really, I'll do what you want.

265
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,361
I won't scream.

266
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,265
I beg you,
don't tie me up, please.

267
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,589
And how long can
this take to develop?

268
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,056
Yes, keep up the treatment.

269
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,134
All right, doctor.

270
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,226
Thanks a lot.
Bye.

271
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:47,873
I want to be all right.
I don't want to cry...

272
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,909
I will not cry,
I will not cry.

273
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,917
I will not cry,.

274
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,289
I will not cry.

275
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,724
I will not -

276
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:14,195
Can you get me something
to calm me down?

277
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,272
Have you got money?

278
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,567
No.

279
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,835
Then what will I get
in exchange?

280
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,345
Am I making myself clear?

281
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,905
I accuse you
of being a menace.

282
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,045
A manipulator!

283
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,550
"Oh, I can't!"

284
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,987
You cry, a bit, and that's it.

285
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,149
I accuse you of being
a little girl

286
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,886
who has to be spanked.

287
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,484
Daddy has to spank
the little girl.

288
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,790
Huh?

289
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:17,799
She doesn't know. what to do.
She didn't have a daddy.

290
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,699
I condemn you to having a mirror
always in front of you.

291
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,175
I condemn you to judge yourself.

292
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,576
I condemn you to life.

293
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,819
I'm going out.

294
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,554
If you do what you shouldn't,
I'll tie you up.

295
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,527
I'll put a gag on you,

296
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,794
and you'll stay like that
till you explode.

297
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,870
I swear I won't.

298
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,811
They confirmed it to me.

299
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,881
This isn't a medicine that's...
alternative in the sense of -

300
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,984
one thing or another.

301
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,859
There are many factors
that in the end

302
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,262
may result in a cancer.

303
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:27,030
Has there been anything
emotional that might have...

304
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,401
had a great impact on you?

305
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,872
Some sort of loss?

306
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:37,208
My brother died three years ago.

307
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:39,179
He committed suicide.

308
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,684
He needed meand...

309
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:48,324
I feel like I couldn't...
be there for him, or...

310
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,427
Do you feel guilty?

311
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:09,105
If you decide to undergo
radiotherapy or chemotherapy,

312
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:14,411
we're all here to help you.

313
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:19,182
But you're the one
who has to take hold

314
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,621
of the reins of your life.

315
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,809
Can I use the bathroom
before I go?

316
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,450
OPPRESSION

317
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,762
Do what you have to do.

318
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:11,566
Victor?

319
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,267
Are you okay?

320
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,970
Yes.

321
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,774
You're a dick.

322
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,726
Water!

323
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,598
Give me some water!

324
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:54,740
Give me some water, please.

325
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,391
I will tame you.

326
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,668
If I tell you to do something,
you do it.

327
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,501
You don't want to see
what I'm capable of.

328
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,199
Can you understand
two things at the same time?

329
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,776
Yes!

330
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,538
Did I tell you to shout at me?

331
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,376
No.

332
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:33,081
The only thing you have to
put your energy into,

333
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,819
concentrate your thoughts on,
and the only thing you have to

334
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,896
put your whole being into
is in doing what I tell you.

335
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,897
I tell you to look at me,
and you look at me.

336
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,990
All the time.

337
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,332
Did I tell you to
stop looking at me?

338
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,301
No.

339
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,373
- Did I?
- No.

340
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,297
Mom, it's Alex.

341
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,770
Ana hasn't come home
in two days.

342
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,139
I've looked in her usual
places the past two nights

343
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,735
and I can't find her.

344
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:33,373
I don't know who else
can help me.

345
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,772
You've changed,
you're someone else.

346
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:04,210
Though in reality,
you're the same as ever.

347
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,750
A coward.
You left me like a cow ard

348
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,753
and now you have me here,
like a coward.

349
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,914
So let me go.

350
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,966
IMPOTENCE

351
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,872
Hope.

352
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,207
I love you.

353
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,451
I love you.

354
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,182
I can't live without you.

355
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,451
I don't know how to tell you.

356
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,024
I don't know how to tell you.

357
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,124
I'm in bad shape.

358
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,938
Look at me, please.

359
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,870
Don't take your eyes off me.

360
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:34,205
Don't take your eyes
off me, please.

361
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,642
Don't take your eyes off me.

362
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,304
Trust me, please.

363
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:39,574
Look at me.

364
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,979
Don't take your eyes off me.

365
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,574
Don't take your eyes
off me, please.

366
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:46,177
Please! Please!

367
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:48,814
Look at me!
Look at me!

368
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,062
Ana.

369
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,190
Ana, don't make me crazy.

370
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,132
Don't make me crazy.

371
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,397
I'm capable of any madness.

372
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,338
Don't make me crazy.

373
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:08,433
Don't do it,
for your own good.

374
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:23,491
Victor, please!
Let me go, please!

375
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:31,294
I'm dying
and you have no idea...

376
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:36,973
because you don't feel anything
and I feel everything

377
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:41,832
and I'm dying!

378
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:44,413
I don't want to die!

379
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,840
I have to rid myself of this.
I have to.

380
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,151
Let me go.

381
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:00,560
No! No!

382
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,496
Please!
Please, no.

383
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,403
Please.

384
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:16,701
I hate you.

385
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,432
I can't anymore.

386
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:50,574
He's not going to stop.
He's not going to stop.

387
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,079
How do you stop?

388
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,367
Oh, God!

389
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:37,109
You want to stay tied up?
Yes, you do.

390
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:41,156
You want be tied up,
to be told how things are,

391
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,782
for them to fuck up your life
as much as possible, right?

392
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,686
Very, well.

393
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:49,889
Help me, please.

394
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,357
Come here.

395
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,566
I know...

396
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,660
I know l have to be better,
and I know

397
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:06,037
I have to change, but...

398
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,508
I don't know how
to do it alone.

399
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,074
Please help me.

400
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:18,586
Do what you have to do...

401
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:22,681
but I want to get out of this.

402
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,283
Please.

403
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:29,960
Please, come here.

404
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:39,701
I know I did everything wrong.

405
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:43,176
I do everything wrong,
but I want to do it right.

406
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,645
I want to live differently.

407
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:53,746
Victor...

408
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,556
Please, come, help me.

409
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,355
Please.

410
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:08,772
I don't feel I can do it,
and I'm really scared.

411
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,798
And so alone.

412
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:17,674
SUBMISSION

413
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,547
Victor, please, come here.

414
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,018
I'm so scared of being alone.

415
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:30,718
Don't leave me alone, please.

416
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,196
I don't want to be alone!

417
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,664
I'm always alone!

418
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,960
Come here, please.

419
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,731
Help me.
Come here.

420
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,437
You really don't remember
what happened to your father?

421
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:21,976
What happened?

422
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,807
I don't know how to remember.

423
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:35,647
Are you cold?

424
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,528
You have to give it up.

425
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:04,179
Your mother and father,
they turned their back on you.

426
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,523
And look at you.

427
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,594
You're chained up.

428
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:17,227
Look at them.

429
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,867
Tell them:

430
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:27,272
"Dad, Mum, thank you. "

431
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,276
I don't know how..

432
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,868
To them.

433
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,438
Dad, Mom...

434
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,383
thank you.

435
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,731
Victor, please help me.

436
01:08:02,344 --> 01:08:04,278
It's your father.

437
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,848
He turns his back on you.

438
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,541
It's your mother.

439
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,778
Look at your mother, look.

440
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:14,219
Your mother is here.
She tums her back on you.

441
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:17,087
You tell them:

442
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,629
"I have come with you this far. "

443
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,663
Turn your back.

444
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:50,685
Victor, I think
you got me wrong.

445
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:55,186
I don't understand a thing,
I just want to get out of here.

446
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,670
You're not going now.

447
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,367
I have it all ready so that
you go when you have to.

448
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:11,003
When the time is right.

449
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,844
Everything I have is yours.

450
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,616
Do you understand?

451
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:24,014
The money I have left,
this place,

452
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:28,119
the shrouded furniture,
it's all yours.

453
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,893
When you have to go,
when you're ready,

454
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:36,233
when the time is right...
you'll go.

455
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:43,303
You're not ready yet.

456
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:50,344
But you're doing well.

457
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,613
I'm very proud of you.

458
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:59,490
Well done.
Well done.

459
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:07,830
But there's work to be done...

460
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,802
hard work.

461
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,882
It's so painful loving you.

462
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,782
You have to live.

463
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,151
I have to die.

464
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:18,734
I loved tricking you.

465
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,510
I told you I turned around,
but I saw it all.

466
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,013
You sat down for a piss,
it dribbled at first,

467
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,142
but then it came out.

468
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,619
How it hit the water.

469
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,917
Then came the feces,

470
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:38,425
the crap.

471
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:42,019
The shame, the shame
I made you feel.

472
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,430
You squeezed softly,
very softly,

473
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:48,264
but I was there watching it all.

474
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,933
What are you doing?

475
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,916
I heard how your piss fell.

476
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,058
You're making me dizzy.

477
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:45,023
Move around a little.

478
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:47,459
Go on, yes, for yourself.

479
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:49,258
I'm not looking at you,

480
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,094
I don't care.

481
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,861
I'm not looking.

482
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:55,095
Why do you think you're here?

483
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,672
For me to look at?

484
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,172
Move a little.

485
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:01,504
I'll move around, too.

486
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,601
Move a little so I can
talk to you.

487
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,339
Do you want me to tell you
what's wrong with me?

488
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,880
Yes.

489
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:13,086
I have a tumor on the left
hemisphere of my head.

490
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:18,785
It began the size of a lentil,
and now it's a fist.

491
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:23,524
It's spreading through my head,
spreading through my head.

492
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:27,491
I feel my tumor
as a sixth sense.

493
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:30,367
I am a product of my tumor.

494
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:34,067
I see I am not capable of being
an artist as I wanted to be.

495
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:37,737
Don't touch me because if you do
I will pass my tumor onto you,

496
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:43,307
and you will become ill like me,
and see the light like me.

497
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:48,823
You WILL see the light and you
won't have to live in fear...

498
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:52,022
in fear...
Like Shit!

499
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,464
Cancer, how evil it is.

500
01:14:02,571 --> 01:14:04,903
It kills us all.

501
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,373
Such fear!

502
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:12,040
Pneumonia, angina,
cardiac arrest...

503
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,446
Fear.

504
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:22,655
We are dating; how wonderful
that we are dating!

505
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:26,922
Oh, the love.
The love is wonderful.

506
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:32,126
What a feeling for life.
Wanting to live.

507
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,333
How I love to be with her.

508
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,307
How l love when she touches me.

509
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,909
How I love my life.

510
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:53,144
Let's dance, let's live.

511
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:57,487
I don't want it to end.

512
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:03,823
Let's not lose respect -

513
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:08,869
because if we lose respect,
what's left?

514
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,373
And you're blind.
You're going to see.

515
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:29,849
The truest thing in my life
is the tumor.

516
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,586
The tumor is true.

517
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:38,226
It's the only fucking dark,
painful thing I truly have.

518
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:44,897
It's the only thing of mine
that I have.

519
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:48,636
The only true thing I have.

520
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:51,679
It is the truth.

521
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,485
My brother came to see me.

522
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:09,860
He was in a bad way.
I couldn't see it.

523
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:14,493
He needed me there,
and I wasn't.

524
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:20,874
I was all he had.

525
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,877
The next time I saw him
he was dead.

526
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,556
It hurts me to look at you.

527
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,936
GIVING IN

528
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:44,874
I think if you hadn't come,

529
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:48,285
I would have simply thrown
myself to the ground,

530
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,881
and died.

531
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,927
Look...

532
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:58,488
I've spent almost a year
in a process of

533
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,467
getting myself off everything.

534
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,936
Incredible, terrifying,

535
01:19:04,039 --> 01:19:06,507
a nightmare.

536
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,668
Really, you can't imagine.

537
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,871
Was it worth it?

538
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,949
Well, I'd like to think so.

539
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:21,181
Though for me,
almost nothing seems worth it.

540
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:25,049
You're worth it.

541
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:28,520
There's a writer who talks about
something called epic legend.

542
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,993
Things happen,
and in such a way,

543
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,936
but we tell a story,
and that is epic legend.

544
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:55,579
I think the story,
I tell myself...

545
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,786
is about a girl...

546
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:04,457
and the father
is evil because...

547
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:07,160
he hurts the girl.

548
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,109
And...

549
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:20,948
He touches her.

550
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:26,988
The girl only thought
and dreamt of

551
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:31,923
hurting this father,
until...

552
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,468
the father died,

553
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:46,006
but not how...
everyone thought,

554
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:54,772
from a sudden heart attack,
with no explanation.

555
01:21:15,937 --> 01:21:18,371
Did you kill him?

556
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:24,104
I was always jealous
of your brother.

557
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:35,380
I want you to kiss me.

558
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:21,208
My love.

559
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,012
Stop, don't move.

560
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:31,218
Don't breathe.

561
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:12,190
Everything will be all right,
won't it?

562
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:19,572
Everything will be all right.

563
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:34,682
Not alone again.

564
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:37,156
You're not alone.

565
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:41,757
You're not alone.

566
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,268
Death.

567
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,767
I'm going to come back.

568
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,027
Please.

569
01:30:47,909 --> 01:30:49,877
Please.

570
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:31,977
Each time you
embrace me I feel you.

571
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:38,054
Each time getting smaller;
each time getting more fragile.

572
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:44,662
But with your death,
something new is born.

573
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:47,495
The necessity to live -

574
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:53,164
to live and leave behind
the guilt, the ghosts;

575
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:56,939
and the fear;

576
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:59,342
Forever.

577
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:28,493
I will miss you very much.
