1
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,083
"Your turn!"

2
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:38,000
(Soundtrack: finger-guessing game from TV)

3
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:40,166
"Here goes ..."

4
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:41,500
"Straight six!"

5
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,250
"We have deep feelings for each other"

6
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:47,082
"That's five wins! Don't let go"

7
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,751
"Loneliness is hard to bear"

8
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:52,458
"Four happinesses, two couples"

9
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,167
"Let me give you all my love"

10
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:57,833
"Two good brothers, eight highways"

11
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,542
"Three toasts to the revolution!"

12
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:03,125
"Drunk every day, drink with every meal"

13
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:05,792
"Drink like an Asian hero"

14
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,458
"There's a cow up the mountain"

15
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,999
"Dancing with rigid hips"

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,541
"Eyes like green peas on a turtle's head"

17
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:15,959
"My hands are on your hips ..."

18
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,000
Get on

19
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,791
Where to?

20
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:57,501
- Downtown
- Get on!

21
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:19,709
Get the guy to pay his fare

22
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,459
Mister, can you pay your fare?

23
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,876
Your ticket?

24
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,292
I'm a policeman

25
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,750
Fenyang Public Security Bureau...

26
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:53,292
Fenyang People's Procuratorate...

27
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:55,542
Fenyang People's Court...

28
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:57,626
and Fenyang Justice Bureau...

29
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:03,334
urge criminals to turn themselves in

30
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:07,751
To advance the rectification policy
and the fight against crime...

31
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:10,291
the county party committee
and the government...

32
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,375
have launched a 100-day
public security campaign

33
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:19,667
This campaign is county-wide

34
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:26,334
The relevant national laws
and regulations...

35
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,500
There's one thing...

36
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:39,041
My supplier from Xiaoyi came yesterday

37
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,999
Someone stole his wallet on the way

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The money is no big deal...

39
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,791
but he needs to get his ID back

40
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,542
As you know, it's a hassle to get a new ID

41
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:47,876
When was it stolen?

42
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,917
Around dusk, yesterday

43
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,042
Where?

44
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,542
By the bus terminal

45
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,876
I'll ask around

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,209
Try your best, will you?

47
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:06,125
That damn Xiaoyong is going great guns

48
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:09,918
They say he's been to South Korea

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,082
No way, it was North Korea!

50
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,500
Whatever, he got to go abroad

51
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,042
He's smart

52
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:26,333
Dear viewers,
our famous local entrepreneur...

53
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,626
Mr. Jin Xiaoyong will
get married tomorrow

54
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:31,583
On behalf of Fenyang
TV's call-in program...

55
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:33,708
I'd like to give Mr. Jin
our most sincere congratulations!

56
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:34,918
Thank you

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,958
Mr. Jin, tomorrow is your wedding day

58
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:40,166
Many friends have called in to us...

59
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,584
to request songs for your wedding

60
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,125
Do you have a few words for
our viewers and friends?

61
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,125
People of Fenyang, old friends...

62
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,876
First, I want to thank you for all
the support and help over the years

63
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:57,459
On this special occasion...

64
00:05:57,709 --> 00:06:02,792
in gratitude to supporters
of our company in Fenyang...

65
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,125
I'd like to give something back
to the community

66
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,667
Our company has decided
to donate 30,000 yuan...

67
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:12,459
to Fenyang's 'Project Hope'

68
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:16,541
Hang on, there's no rush! Er Bao...

69
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,792
There's no need...

70
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:19,918
Don't go just yet

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,459
A gift from Xiaoyong. Take it, take it

72
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:31,250
- Come on
- Okay

73
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,083
- See you tomorrow
- Take care

74
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,250
Bye

75
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,834
What a schedule!

76
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,876
Hey, your mother was asking
if you've invited Xiao Wu

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,500
Huh? Why is she worrying about Xiao Wu?

78
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:56,042
I'm just saying she asked

79
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,542
Forget it

80
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,834
What should we do? Shall I tell him?

81
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,209
Are you kidding? Too late for that

82
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,792
- Where's Dong Dong?
- He hasn't shown up yet

83
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:12,375
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, I was at his place yesterday

84
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:17,167
Who lifted from a Xiaoyi guy yesterday?

85
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:20,250
- Near the bus terminal
- I did

86
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:24,209
- Where's the ID?
- I threw it away

87
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:25,834
Go find it

88
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,542
What's up?

89
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:31,125
He's Gengsheng's friend

90
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,876
This is from yesterday

91
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,334
Liubao...

92
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:45,542
Thanks for the tip

93
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,918
- Lousy weather these days, stay dry
- Does it matter?

94
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,834
You're asking me?

95
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,459
Let's eat

96
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,083
Go ahead

97
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,292
Do you know what this
provincial campaign is all about?

98
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:18,876
Then do you know what 'crack-down' means?

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,167
The purpose of this campaign is...

100
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,416
to promote the newly
promulgated criminal laws

101
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,584
In order to implement the new measures...

102
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:43,625
we must raise public awareness...

103
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,083
and promote the study of the new laws

104
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,333
Such as the code of criminal procedure
and the criminal law

105
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:50,709
Both have come into force this year

106
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,584
We promote...

107
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,375
Give your uncle a hug

108
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:58,833
Be a good girl, will you?

109
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:00,626
Give me a hug

110
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:03,125
Who bought you this mango?

111
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:04,958
Who bought this mango?

112
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,999
- It was your daddy, wasn't it?
- Tell uncle

113
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,167
I'll take her, she's a shy kid

114
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:12,708
Seems nice to have a kid

115
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:15,209
Yeah, means a lot

116
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,834
Did you find that thing?

117
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,876
That ID card, the Xiaoyi guy's

118
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,501
- Is this the one?
- Here, let me see...

119
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,876
Yes, it is

120
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:29,417
You guys know what you're doing

121
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,417
I'll buy you lunch

122
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:32,541
Sure

123
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,042
As you wish

124
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,125
You need to lie low for a bit

125
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,667
They're turning up the heat

126
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,918
If you get yourself caught...

127
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,417
you'll be in real trouble

128
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:43,876
I've stopped

129
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, go easy

130
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:49,751
Why don't you learn to do business?

131
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,292
Look at Xiaoyong

132
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,791
He's doing great

133
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:57,501
I hear he's putting up another building
by the West Gate

134
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,082
I don't think like him

135
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,541
Who does? It's all about gut feeling

136
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,459
Think big, grab your chances

137
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:08,876
Do nothing, get nowhere,
that's what I'm seeing

138
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,375
Excuse me, boss...

139
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,042
What do you want?

140
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,292
We're here with the police,
about the demolition and relocation

141
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:22,417
We don't see you for ages and when you
come you want to demolish the place

142
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,709
- We'll take measurements
- Okay

143
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,709
- Got it?
- Yes

144
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,250
Liang Xiao Wu,
what are you doing here?

145
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:37,334
Chief...

146
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:40,876
Not even a hello?
Pretending you don't know me?

147
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:43,709
I didn't see you

148
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,542
What are you up to?

149
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,042
I'm doing business

150
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,625
Business?
You've heard the announcements?

151
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:52,791
Yes, I have

152
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,458
You... You need to shape up

153
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:55,958
Learn to be a good person

154
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,042
Look at your buddies from the old days

155
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:00,459
Most of them have changed

156
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:02,292
Look at Jin Xiaoyong

157
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:04,374
He runs his own company

158
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,918
They even named him "Model Entrepreneur"

159
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,082
And you? Still up to your old tricks?

160
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,459
I stopped, long since

161
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:13,209
Oh yes, it's his wedding tomorrow

162
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:15,416
His bride is as pretty
as Ni Ping (a TV star)

163
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:18,542
What about you? Are you engaged yet?

164
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,042
He's getting married tomorrow?

165
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,417
Of course, why would I lie to you?

166
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,667
Here, he gave me an invitation

167
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,959
An invite to the wedding, here

168
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:36,375
Chief, I've got to go

169
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,918
Sure

170
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,458
Give it back! What are you doing?

171
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,375
Come over here

172
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:47,291
- What's up?
- Come

173
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:51,125
Don't fool around!
What's wrong with you?

174
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,959
What do you want?

175
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,833
Did Jin Xiaoyong invite you
to his wedding?

176
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:02,082
He didn't tell you?

177
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,584
No, did he tell you?

178
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,626
It's his wedding, not mine...

179
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,375
Did he invite you or not?

180
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,751
He did

181
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:13,375
Maybe he was too busy to tell you

182
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,125
At least you won't have to
shell out for a gift!

183
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:21,626
Shut up!

184
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,750
You just sit there smoking!
Get a move on!

185
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,500
Don't you see what time is it?

186
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:30,082
Time's getting on! And you?

187
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,751
You want to smoke all 20 boxes
before you move your ass?

188
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:36,125
It'll take forever to get it all done

189
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,584
Chef, what are you doing?
Filling prescriptions?

190
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:43,751
Look at the time!
Can you get it done?

191
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:47,584
Just got your jobs done!

192
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:55,083
Hello? What is it?

193
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,459
Of course! What's happening?

194
00:13:59,918 --> 00:14:03,709
I still think you should invite Xiao Wu

195
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:07,333
A wedding is a big deal

196
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:10,751
At least do it as a courtesy

197
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:15,375
I know it's not really my business
but I just had to say it

198
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:19,209
Everyone who comes tomorrow
knows what he does

199
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:20,167
What do you want me to do?

200
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,750
Remind everyone that Jin Xiaoyong...

201
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,667
was once a pickpocket too?
Is that it?

202
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,542
Is that what you want?

203
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:33,291
Let it go! The army is holding
up a load of my cigarettes

204
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:36,042
I need to sort that out

205
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,083
Talk later

206
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,209
And fifthly...

207
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:59,291
Those who fail to report cases,
shelter criminals...

208
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:03,041
destroy criminal evidence
or traffic in stolen goods...

209
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:06,167
shall be investigated and prosecuted

210
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,209
Those who threaten
reporters and witnesses...

211
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,958
will be punished in
accordance with the law

212
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,375
Those who persist in
flouting national laws...

213
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:20,459
will be severely punished

214
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:05,667
"I stand in the mighty wind"

215
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:11,876
"Wishing it could blow
away my endless heartache"

216
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,918
"I watch the clouds which span the skies"

217
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:24,792
"With sword in hand,
wondering who's the hero in this world"

218
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,542
This is cheaper, but the other one's better

219
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,583
Sounds good, doesn't it

220
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:27,958
- Can we have another listen?
- It's not that expensive

221
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,500
You won't find anything
with better sound quality

222
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,875
Even it's not too pricey,
but we want one with better sound

223
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:35,250
Let's hear something else on it

224
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,249
It's the best you can get at this price

225
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,125
See for yourself, have another listen

226
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,625
The bass isn't great

227
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,000
- You think the bass isn't good?
- Hmm...

228
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:52,291
It has the best sound of
any domestic-made product

229
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,834
Great quality absolutely

230
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:36,958
There was one in the mailbox at 8am

231
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:41,334
And then more came at 6pm

232
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,709
Hey, you

233
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,876
What's up?

234
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,709
Change these to big notes for me

235
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:42,292
Are you tired of living?

236
00:19:42,834 --> 00:19:45,999
I told you this morning,
can't you see what's going on?

237
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,292
Are you asking to be caught?

238
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:50,167
Why do it?

239
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:52,042
I need the money

240
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:55,042
If it's urgent, I can lend you some

241
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,166
It makes no sense if I borrow it

242
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,082
Why? Is your ma sick?

243
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,542
No

244
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,583
You need to hide out for a couple of days?

245
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:03,834
No

246
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,501
Then what's it for?

247
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,875
Xiaoyong is getting married tomorrow,
it's for him

248
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,959
As a gift?

249
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,334
Was it worth the risk?

250
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,876
What notes do you want?

251
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,542
Hundreds

252
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,959
Here you are

253
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,125
What is it for?

254
00:20:55,459 --> 00:20:57,626
Give me some red paper, to wrap it

255
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,167
Red paper?

256
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:14,291
Why are you weighing it?

257
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:17,083
It's paper money, not gold

258
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:40,501
One year when Xiaoyong and I
had only 41 cents between us...

259
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:44,876
we went on foot all the way
from Fenyang to Beijing

260
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:55,667
We were in a motel when I told him...

261
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,959
that when he got married...

262
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:02,125
I'd give him six kilos of money

263
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,083
There weren't 100-yuan notes back then
The biggest was a 10

264
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:27,041
You think he still needs your money?

265
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:29,292
He's much better off than you now

266
00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:31,541
It's not about the money

267
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,542
We are different

268
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,667
Here...

269
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,167
- Is it done?
- Yes

270
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:23,209
Go on then

271
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,167
You're here...

272
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,709
- Been busy?
- So-so

273
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,584
Let's talk inside, come on

274
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,876
Can you take a look at this, boss?

275
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,375
- You go in first
- Do what you have to

276
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,667
- What is it?
- How's this deep-fried meat ball?

277
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:02,292
It's okay, as long as it is deep-fried

278
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,959
Try some, it's freshly made

279
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:00,626
I just ate

280
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,792
Try it

281
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:07,334
What's this all about?

282
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:22,417
I'm getting married tomorrow

283
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:42,000
You didn't invite me?

284
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:50,542
It won't be a big party, just family,
haven't told many others

285
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,667
Don't tell me you were
too busy or just forgot...

286
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:59,501
to invite me to your wedding

287
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:02,209
Not many people knew

288
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:06,459
It's not what you think,
just a few people, mostly family

289
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:09,501
You're doing it on the cheap?

290
00:26:09,709 --> 00:26:11,834
Mostly family

291
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:14,667
Family?

292
00:26:14,709 --> 00:26:17,792
Since when is the police chief family?

293
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:24,125
And Fatty Wu? He's family, too?

294
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:36,292
You've fucking changed...

295
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:45,792
Fucking changed...

296
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,124
Stop fucking this, fucking that...

297
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,375
Okay, okay

298
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:53,626
Are you pissed-off?

299
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:56,459
I pissed you off?

300
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,501
No

301
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:05,501
I'm not pissed off with you

302
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:21,709
Don't say you forgot

303
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:25,167
You fucking did forget

304
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,709
I did forget

305
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,459
It's true

306
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,500
What's this?

307
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,250
A gift

308
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,125
Money?

309
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,417
Take it back

310
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:07,417
What's it for?

311
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,292
I have to go

312
00:28:24,459 --> 00:28:28,375
Look at your tattoo, you fucker

313
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:01,999
Dear viewers...

314
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,583
Our famous local entrepreneur...

315
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:06,124
Mr. Jin Xiaoyong will
get married tomorrow

316
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:09,124
On behalf of Fenyang
TV's call-in program...

317
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:12,501
I'd like to give Mr. Jin
our most sincere congratulations

318
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,374
Mr. Jin, tomorrow is your wedding day

319
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,666
Many friends have called in to us...

320
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:20,249
to request songs for your wedding

321
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,542
Do you have a few words for
our viewers and friends?

322
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:26,333
People of Fenyang, old friends...

323
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:31,167
First, I want to thank you
for all the support and help over the years

324
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:34,209
On this special occasion...

325
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:37,542
In sincere gratitude...

326
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:43,000
to supporters of our
company in Fenyang...

327
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:46,834
I'd like to give something back
to the community

328
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,625
Now, it's time for your calls

329
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:53,708
Our first request comes from Erhu
and others in the Fenyang Grain Bureau

330
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,459
The song they've chosen
for Mr. Jin is 'Raining Heart'

331
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:22,876
"The lady is pretty, the lady is charming"

332
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:26,459
"The lady walks in the green fields"

333
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:30,959
"The ears of corn have grown"

334
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,167
What's so funny?

335
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,751
Nothing, go on singing

336
00:32:02,792 --> 00:32:05,000
I won't

337
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:11,834
How come?
I spent big money to hear you sing

338
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,709
Go on

339
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,959
No, I won't

340
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,918
Karaoke isn't fun if you don't join in

341
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,709
I want you to sing

342
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:31,834
Big sister, play some duets

343
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:51,792
This song is for two people

344
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:14,751
"My feelings are like an untouchable net"

345
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:23,125
"My feelings are no
longer a streaming ocean"

346
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,250
Your turn

347
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:26,375
You go on

348
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,958
Come on!

349
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,292
Go on, sing!

350
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,000
Grow up! You're as shy as a girl!

351
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,584
Take the mic

352
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:36,416
It's only a song, it won't kill you

353
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:38,125
Come on

354
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:54,042
Why aren't you singing?

355
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,834
I can't sing

356
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:58,792
- You can't do 'Raining Heart'?
- No

357
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,375
'I Heard You Singing Once'?

358
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:10,292
When was that?

359
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,417
It's the name of a song

360
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:14,584
How about...

361
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:19,583
'Tow-men in Love'?

362
00:34:19,584 --> 00:34:21,000
No

363
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,458
'Neither Rainy Nor Windy'?

364
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:28,209
No

365
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,959
Are you kidding me?

366
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,709
I really can't

367
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:03,250
Boss...

368
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:05,918
Your girl is no good

369
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,000
What's wrong?

370
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:11,584
I spent 50 just to sit around?

371
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:13,584
How come?

372
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:15,208
In our "Great Shanghai Karaoke"...

373
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:17,458
everyone has fun dancing and drinking

374
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:20,500
She refuses to sing or dance

375
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:23,876
That can't be right! Meimei!

376
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:29,167
Our guest Xiao Wu isn't satisfied
with your service

377
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,250
I asked him to join in
a song and he wouldn't

378
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:34,292
I asked him to dance and he wouldn't

379
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,250
What did I tell you?

380
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:39,125
Our guest Xiao Wu is like my brother

381
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:41,167
If he doesn't want to
sing, you do it for him

382
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:43,834
If he doesn't dance, you do it for him

383
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:47,083
- How can you be so dumb?
- Never mind

384
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,167
Brother, this won't do

385
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:54,459
You're my brother,
I can't accept your money

386
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:58,542
It's too embarrassing

387
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,791
You don't have a smaller bill?

388
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,125
No

389
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:06,000
How about this...

390
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:10,584
Meimei, take a stroll
outside with your brother

391
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:14,292
Cheer him up, you hear me? Go on

392
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:19,876
Here's your jacket, get going, all right?

393
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:24,792
Brother, get her back here before dawn

394
00:36:24,918 --> 00:36:27,709
What am I saying? Dawn?

395
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:30,124
Get her back here before nightfall

396
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,292
All right?

397
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,792
Get going! Hurry up!

398
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,000
You silly girl, get going! Go on!

399
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:41,542
What a nuisance!

400
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,876
Where are we going?

401
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:17,125
I shouldn't have worn my high heels today

402
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:30,667
You could go up there,
that'd be even higher!

403
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:13,334
You're quite stubborn, aren't you?

404
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,250
Let's go back

405
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,417
Okay, I can go by myself

406
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,876
That's all I get for my 50 yuan?

407
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:35,249
You're boring

408
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,626
Didn't you tell me to go?

409
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:41,584
You're the fucking boring one

410
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,417
What isn't boring?

411
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,417
How about this...

412
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:03,125
Come with me,
I need to make a phonecall

413
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:10,918
Is that the paper mill?

414
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,667
Can I speak to Chen Gailian?

415
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,167
I'm her daughter

416
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:22,541
It's a long distance call from Beijing,
so please hurry

417
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:25,959
From Beijing, thank you

418
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,417
Noisy, isn't it?

419
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,375
Ma, it's Meimei

420
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,417
No, I'm not at school

421
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:47,083
I'm with a film director

422
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,584
Don't know yet

423
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:53,167
I know

424
00:39:57,751 --> 00:40:00,167
I know

425
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:03,709
How's everyone at home?

426
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:09,792
Is my brother still getting into fights?

427
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:14,667
After all, he's a worker now,
he needs to grow up

428
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,125
How's dad?

429
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,626
Is he getting better?

430
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:27,000
Tell him not to lose his temper

431
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:30,709
Don't you worry

432
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,876
Take care of yourself

433
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,542
I know

434
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,375
Don't worry, I'm fine

435
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:43,250
No need to worry about me

436
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,125
Okay

437
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:51,959
Okay, I'll call you when I'm free

438
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,000
Bye

439
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,584
So this is Beijing?

440
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,334
Who am I?

441
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:07,250
I'm the film director?

442
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:31,834
Miss, what would you like
to do with your hair?

443
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,250
Just a shampoo and oil treatment

444
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,918
Miss, you have great hair
Do you fancy trying a 30s look?

445
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:40,167
It's called "Red Dust in the Wind"

446
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,626
- What's that?
- It's the latest thing!

447
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,626
Forget it, just the oil treatment is fine

448
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:49,501
Oil treatment it is

449
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:52,459
Shit, you southerners know all the tricks

450
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,584
Have a cigarette

451
00:41:58,334 --> 00:42:01,334
Everyone's into mood and taste these days

452
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:05,542
- No shampoo for you, mister?
- Me? No

453
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:20,626
Let's put on some music to enhance the mood

454
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:28,125
- Have you ever been to a salon with a girl before?
- Never

455
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:31,459
But you know how to please a girl

456
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:33,125
What do you mean?

457
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:36,876
You unplugged the guy's
electricity, just like that

458
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,542
That's easy

459
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:43,791
Deep-fried dough sticks
are called 'Youtiao' in Fenyang

460
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:46,626
In Tianjin, they call them 'Guozi'

461
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:49,542
So 'Guozi' are 'Youtiao'
but they taste better

462
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:51,667
Really?

463
00:44:17,459 --> 00:44:19,083
Pretty?

464
00:44:19,292 --> 00:44:20,584
Not bad

465
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,917
Actually, you're more
interesting than I thought

466
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:33,334
I'm ordinary

467
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,501
It's getting dark

468
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,667
I must go back

469
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:46,459
So that's all?

470
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:55,125
Time's up, no more entertainment

471
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:58,959
So I spent 50 on your
phone call and hair-do?

472
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:06,584
You had nowhere else to
go, that's not my fault

473
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:17,876
I'm going back to the karaoke bar

474
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:20,501
Come and see me there sometime

475
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:25,958
What are you doing here?

476
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:28,751
Nothing, officer, just passing the time

477
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:31,999
Passing the time? Show me what's in the bag

478
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,959
Come on, open it

479
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:41,334
Fuck! Did you betray me?

480
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,626
Aren't you going to check the guns?

481
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,125
I trust you

482
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:13,292
"Each day, I wander"

483
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:18,292
"Wander with no regard for day or night"

484
00:47:18,459 --> 00:47:23,041
"How I long for some companionship"

485
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:28,167
"To keep my heart from drifting"

486
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,209
Give it back!

487
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:50,000
Come here

488
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:30,792
Are you fucking crazy?

489
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:33,417
Just having fun, no meaning

490
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,333
Let's go play mahjong

491
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:37,250
Not interested

492
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:39,124
What's wrong? I can' fool around with you?

493
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,834
No, fuck it, you can't

494
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,709
You bloody idiot!

495
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,709
Fine!

496
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:20,458
I want to stand on the seashore,
I'd like to see the sky again

497
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,918
The sound of the waves is so wonderful

498
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,708
Okay, pack your things first

499
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:27,250
I'll be back soon

500
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:29,459
I'll wait for you

501
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:41,209
You had the chance to leave

502
00:49:41,334 --> 00:49:43,042
Why didn't you go?

503
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,167
Why?

504
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:43,083
"My feelings are like an untouchable net"

505
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:52,459
"My feelings are no
longer a streaming ocean"

506
00:50:53,792 --> 00:51:01,459
"In these long, rainy days ..."

507
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,834
"why do I keep thinking about you?"

508
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:57,167
Boss?

509
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,334
Boss?

510
00:52:03,751 --> 00:52:05,584
Boss?

511
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,083
Who is it?

512
00:52:16,083 --> 00:52:19,334
You're too early, we're not open yet

513
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:23,292
- Spending my money here is no good?
- Not at all

514
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:30,083
Hurry up! Get ready!

515
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:39,125
Who'd you like to see today?

516
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,750
A Sichuan girl or a Guizhou girl?

517
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:44,625
Today, I want a Beijing girl

518
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:48,875
- Beijing? So you want me to keep you company?
- Sure!

519
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:51,792
Come on, be serious

520
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:55,459
Where's Hu Meimei?

521
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:58,834
Meimei?

522
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,834
You have a thing for her

523
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,709
That's right

524
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:04,959
She's sick, not in today

525
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:07,250
- Sick?
- Uh-huh

526
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:10,334
She must've been dancing too much

527
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:11,709
Listen...

528
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:13,709
We have other girls here

529
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:15,501
I'll get you another one

530
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:17,375
You're playing me

531
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:33,750
Don't just stand there

532
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,792
You have work to do, clean up this mess

533
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:38,000
She really is sick?

534
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:40,000
Yes, I wouldn't lie to you

535
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,417
Where does she live? I'll go see her

536
00:53:42,459 --> 00:53:44,375
Why not, if you want to...

537
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:54,000
Meimei, you're lucky to have a day off work

538
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:57,042
Lucky? I feel like I'm dying

539
00:53:57,584 --> 00:53:59,459
Can you stay with me?

540
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:01,125
It's nothing serious

541
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:03,083
Drink some hot water and you'll be fine

542
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:06,918
- Is there any hot water?
- We haven't boiled it yet

543
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,292
Meimei, we're going now

544
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,584
Bye-bye

545
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,959
I'm off. Bye-bye

546
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,751
I'm going, too. Bye-bye

547
00:56:05,792 --> 00:56:07,291
Did you find it?

548
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:08,667
Yes, I did

549
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:10,751
Good

550
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:43,417
Santu!

551
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:45,417
Over here

552
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,209
Fuck, you're smart!

553
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:52,584
Learning to socialize...

554
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:55,626
and pick up girls!

555
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:57,875
And you're not even shaving yet!

556
00:56:57,876 --> 00:56:59,959
Give me some face, okay?

557
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,292
You'll do

558
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:08,834
Run along

559
00:57:35,959 --> 00:57:37,375
Who is it?

560
00:57:37,417 --> 00:57:39,000
Me

561
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:43,459
Why are you here?

562
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:46,667
To see if your boss lied to me

563
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
You shouldn't be here,
the landlady doesn't allow visitors

564
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:55,042
You said to come when I had time,
and I'm free today

565
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:57,918
You're crazy

566
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,042
So you really are sick?

567
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,709
Why would I pretend?

568
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:06,875
What's the problem?

569
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:08,334
Stomachache

570
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,918
That's no big deal

571
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:13,000
Have a smoke, that'll help

572
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,918
No

573
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,792
You want to see a doctor?

574
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,501
No

575
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:29,918
Can I get you some medicine?

576
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:34,375
No, but you could pour me some hot water

577
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:08,042
What's your name?

578
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,292
Seriously?

579
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,709
Liang Xiao Wu

580
00:59:18,876 --> 00:59:21,542
I was just kidding

581
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:23,542
How could I forget?

582
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:26,667
You went to the hair salon with me

583
00:59:35,918 --> 00:59:37,292
Are you all right?

584
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:39,125
Yeah

585
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:49,667
I wish I had a hot-water bag

586
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:53,459
Stay right there

587
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:12,416
What's up?

588
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:14,501
I need a hot-water bag

589
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:19,918
It's on the house, take it

590
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:22,501
- I won't stay, then
- Bye

591
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:27,999
- Are they really demolishing it?
- Yes

592
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,500
I'll come and lend a hand

593
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,334
Don't worry about it

594
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:44,250
Thank you, I'm much better now

595
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:46,000
You're welcome

596
01:00:46,584 --> 01:00:48,417
Take a seat

597
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,541
Your family must own a coalmine

598
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:10,876
You seem to be rolling in money

599
01:01:13,834 --> 01:01:15,918
I'm just a craftsman...

600
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,876
living on my skills

601
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:21,083
You don't look like one

602
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:27,083
I earn my living with my hands

603
01:01:32,834 --> 01:01:36,209
It's not easy to be a craftsman

604
01:01:42,083 --> 01:01:45,959
Some run karaoke bars
Some wholesale cigarettes

605
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:49,959
This is all I can do

606
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:04,876
You really can't sing?

607
01:02:04,918 --> 01:02:06,041
No, I can't

608
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:08,918
Then why do you keep coming?

609
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:20,209
- Do you like hearing me sing?
- Yes, I do

610
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:25,542
I do like singing

611
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:28,626
You know...

612
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:31,792
People often say that I look like a star

613
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,584
But I know very well...

614
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:39,626
that I'll never be a star

615
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:51,667
Sing me a song

616
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:56,334
What do you like to listen to?

617
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:01,417
Your favorite song

618
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:17,209
- I like Faye Wang's songs
- Okay

619
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:21,250
Then I'll sing one

620
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:23,041
Go ahead

621
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,458
Don't laugh at me

622
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,292
I won't

623
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:42,167
"Why is my sky always weeping?"

624
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:52,501
"Why is my sky always so gray?"

625
01:03:54,334 --> 01:04:01,167
"Drifting on the other side of the world"

626
01:04:01,334 --> 01:04:04,584
"Letting loneliness invade me"

627
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:07,249
"Over and over again"

628
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:15,250
"The sky, filled with longing"

629
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:24,959
"Is your sky hung with clouds?"

630
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:35,501
"Does your sky have a cold moon?"

631
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:46,000
"Exiled to the other side of the world"

632
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:49,500
"Letting loneliness invade me"

633
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:52,166
"Night by night"

634
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:59,626
"Sky... filled with ..."

635
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:56,167
How about you sing me a song, too?

636
01:05:56,501 --> 01:06:01,083
- I really can't
- Just one song

637
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:11,209
Close your eyes, then

638
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:25,959
"My feelings are like an untouchable net"

639
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:35,417
"My feelings are no
longer a streaming ocean"

640
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:45,083
"In these long, rainy days ..."

641
01:09:46,751 --> 01:09:54,751
"Why do I keep thinking about you?"

642
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:00,959
"I miss you ..."

643
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:04,834
"I'll miss you one last time"

644
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:26,167
"My feelings are like an untouchable net"

645
01:10:26,918 --> 01:10:34,918
"My feelings are no
longer a streaming ocean"

646
01:10:36,209 --> 01:10:43,834
"In these long, rainy days ..."

647
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:50,834
"Why do I keep thinking about you?"

648
01:10:51,959 --> 01:10:59,959
"My feelings are like the rain in June ..."

649
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:39,667
Xiao Wu...

650
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:43,667
- Why didn't you knock?
- In a joint like this?

651
01:11:43,751 --> 01:11:44,834
Why are you here?

652
01:11:44,876 --> 01:11:46,876
Xiaoyong wants me to give this back to you

653
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,751
What did he say?

654
01:11:49,834 --> 01:11:53,709
He says your money isn't
clean, he can't accept it

655
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:57,667
We're all friends, hope you understand

656
01:11:57,751 --> 01:12:01,209
Go back and tell him these exact words...

657
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:04,959
He gets money by smuggling tobacco
and ripping off bar girls

658
01:12:05,042 --> 01:12:07,125
That's not clean, either

659
01:12:07,209 --> 01:12:09,751
Sure, I'll pass that on

660
01:12:09,834 --> 01:12:11,125
I'll be going

661
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:12,709
Get out!

662
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:15,250
On my way

663
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:22,667
It's okay

664
01:12:22,751 --> 01:12:25,542
Sing your song

665
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:30,334
Be nice to me, will you?

666
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,459
All right

667
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:38,125
- I'll be counting on you
- Fine

668
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,375
Will you be my man?

669
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:45,584
- Sure
- Really?

670
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:48,292
Yeah

671
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:51,334
Promise?

672
01:12:52,792 --> 01:12:54,542
Promise

673
01:12:57,501 --> 01:12:58,751
Xiao Wu!

674
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,292
You again!

675
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:02,751
Xiaoyong says to tell you...

676
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:07,250
He's not smuggling cigarettes,
that's regular trade

677
01:13:07,459 --> 01:13:11,667
And he's not ripping off the singers
in the karaoke bars

678
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:14,959
That's just the entertainment business.
That's it

679
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:16,124
Get lost!

680
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,542
Sure, I'm off... Bye-bye

681
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:22,501
What's wrong?

682
01:13:24,626 --> 01:13:26,209
What's wrong?

683
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:28,125
It's okay

684
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:32,209
I'm fine

685
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:38,125
From now on I'll come
by to see you every day

686
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:40,417
No need for that, just buy a pager

687
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:44,250
I'll page you whenever I'm free, okay?

688
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:45,751
Okay

689
01:14:07,751 --> 01:14:10,500
"Can't shake my thoughts
about being in love"

690
01:14:10,501 --> 01:14:13,918
"Can't stop thinking about anger and hate"

691
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:18,876
"All generations are fated"

692
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:22,584
"We shed the same blood"

693
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:26,083
"We drink the same water"

694
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:30,709
"It's a long road, stretching far"

695
01:14:31,542 --> 01:14:34,542
"Each red flower has its own green leaf"

696
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:38,250
"But who will be my life's companion?"

697
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:43,167
"So distantly remote, coming and going"

698
01:14:43,459 --> 01:14:46,500
"Days gone by return to haunt me"

699
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:50,167
"A lotus root may snap,
but its thread holds"

700
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:55,667
"The world keeps changing,
and I can only sigh"

701
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:12,501
Is it for your fiancée?

702
01:16:35,459 --> 01:16:37,958
No need to check,
it beeps when someone pages you

703
01:16:37,959 --> 01:16:40,334
Your play, come on

704
01:17:20,626 --> 01:17:23,708
Well, brother, look at you today!

705
01:17:23,709 --> 01:17:24,875
I look okay?

706
01:17:24,876 --> 01:17:28,334
Better than that, you look great!
As if you're just back from America

707
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,750
You must be doing well!

708
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,334
Not bad

709
01:17:34,334 --> 01:17:37,167
Thanks for the smoke

710
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:41,625
Big sister, how's business?

711
01:17:41,626 --> 01:17:43,918
We get by

712
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,417
Not like you!

713
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:52,125
Always making easy money, aren't you?

714
01:17:55,584 --> 01:17:57,501
You've made all this money...

715
01:17:57,584 --> 01:17:59,583
But you still smoke Hong Ta Shan?

716
01:17:59,584 --> 01:18:02,125
You should switch to imported ones

717
01:18:02,292 --> 01:18:04,375
You can afford it, brother

718
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:09,083
Is Meimei here?

719
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:11,626
Not here today

720
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,375
Where is she?

721
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:15,709
She's out on a job

722
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:19,751
I'll wait for her then

723
01:18:19,959 --> 01:18:21,667
Sorry, no

724
01:18:21,751 --> 01:18:23,834
Not today, not possible

725
01:18:23,876 --> 01:18:27,834
See, she won't be back soon

726
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,000
Where has she gone?

727
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:33,501
There were some clients from outside

728
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,750
From where?

729
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:38,792
They picked her up by car

730
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:40,249
Where are they from?

731
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,876
Taiyuan

732
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:42,918
From Taiyuan?

733
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:45,584
Yes, from Taiyuan

734
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:55,125
Why did you let her go?

735
01:18:55,709 --> 01:18:57,833
You knew I was coming today

736
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,750
You should have come earlier

737
01:18:59,751 --> 01:19:02,834
It's not my job to watch her for you

738
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:11,209
You're so fucking ungrateful

739
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:14,167
Watch what you say, you

740
01:19:14,209 --> 01:19:16,000
You don't own her

741
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,666
What are you to her?

742
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:20,000
What is she to you?

743
01:19:20,209 --> 01:19:26,083
You swagger in with your dirty money,
like you own the place!

744
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:40,751
Hu Meimei

745
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:44,042
Who's looking for Hu Meimei?

746
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:49,459
Oh, it's you

747
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,416
Is she back yet?

748
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:53,334
She moved out

749
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:06,876
She really did move out

750
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,959
Someone came in a car this morning...

751
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:14,459
and helped with her stuff

752
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,501
Where the hell did she go?

753
01:20:41,584 --> 01:20:42,875
No idea

754
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:44,583
She didn't even tell the boss

755
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:47,584
It must be somewhere great

756
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:40,584
Ma, I have something for you

757
01:21:40,626 --> 01:21:42,792
You brought me a gift?

758
01:21:42,918 --> 01:21:45,417
It's a ring

759
01:21:47,918 --> 01:21:50,667
You must be tricking me

760
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:53,918
Let me see it

761
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,709
I got it for Ma, not you

762
01:21:56,751 --> 01:22:02,501
Your old man can look at whatever he wants

763
01:22:12,459 --> 01:22:14,583
We've been peasants for three generations

764
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:17,959
I can't tell if it's gold or copper

765
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:24,000
It's gold,
I wouldn't give my ma a copper ring

766
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:34,584
What's the occasion? Why do a pig's head?

767
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:37,751
Our sister-in-law is coming tomorrow

768
01:22:37,959 --> 01:22:40,917
You call her that even though
they aren't married yet

769
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:43,584
- Don't be an idiot
- Like you're any better, loser

770
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:45,918
I am a loser

771
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:03,417
"Oh, papa"

772
01:23:05,334 --> 01:23:10,709
"My sweet papa"

773
01:23:12,876 --> 01:23:17,167
"Oh, mama"

774
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:23,083
"My beloved mama"

775
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:54,000
"Poison!"

776
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:59,000
"You... What do you think you're doing?"

777
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:17,334
- Dad, are my brother and his fiancée back?
- Yes, they are

778
01:25:18,959 --> 01:25:20,958
And Cui Xian and the kid?

779
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:22,834
They'll be here in a minute

780
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:24,709
Xiao Wu, when did you get here?

781
01:25:24,751 --> 01:25:26,167
Last night

782
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:29,167
Did you hear that Zheng
Gangtie was arrested?

783
01:25:29,209 --> 01:25:30,583
No, I didn't

784
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,375
That's what I heard

785
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:35,834
Nonsense, I played mahjong
with him a couple of days ago

786
01:25:35,876 --> 01:25:39,374
Since you're all here,
there's something I want to discuss

787
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:42,374
Your brother's fiancée...

788
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:44,500
is a city girl

789
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:46,292
Her family is well off

790
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,542
Ours is not

791
01:25:48,584 --> 01:25:51,417
I've talked with your ma about the money

792
01:25:51,751 --> 01:25:56,124
And I want to talk with you about this too

793
01:25:56,125 --> 01:26:00,291
I want each of you boys
to make a contribution of 5,000 yuan

794
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:03,292
What do you think?

795
01:26:05,584 --> 01:26:07,959
Let's discuss it later

796
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:11,918
Xiao Wu, I hear that Xiaoyong got married?

797
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,125
Yes

798
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:14,750
Who's the bride?

799
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:15,751
I don't know

800
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:18,501
I'm waiting to hear what you think

801
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:25,417
Let's discuss it later

802
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:34,125
Xiao Wu, when did you get a pager?

803
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:36,459
Let me see it

804
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:51,000
Let me see it

805
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:23,459
You're the eldest, say something

806
01:27:23,876 --> 01:27:26,416
Where will I find 5,000?

807
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:29,459
I haven't paid the road
tax on my tractor yet

808
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:32,209
Xiao Wu, what do you say?

809
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:34,876
I'm broke, I'll do what brother does

810
01:27:34,959 --> 01:27:37,501
So what do you think?

811
01:27:37,792 --> 01:27:41,083
Let's come back to it
later, there's no rush

812
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:58,375
Sister...

813
01:27:58,626 --> 01:28:00,918
- You're back
- Yes

814
01:28:03,876 --> 01:28:07,751
Sanduo, you don't need your ma to carry you

815
01:28:13,626 --> 01:28:16,167
Come here, greet your uncle

816
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:19,459
There you go, greet your uncle

817
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:22,334
Say 'uncle'

818
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:25,292
You don't want to?

819
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:28,250
You forgot your uncle?

820
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:32,166
I gotta go

821
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:33,917
Is your brother here?

822
01:28:33,918 --> 01:28:36,375
Yes, he's inside

823
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,000
Uncle, you're here

824
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,291
Would you like some water?

825
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:21,082
No, I've had some

826
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:24,209
I was looking for Erbao

827
01:29:33,375 --> 01:29:37,458
Dad, I saw the fields have been ploughed

828
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:41,625
I did it twice,
yesterday and the day before

829
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:42,917
It's done

830
01:29:42,918 --> 01:29:44,666
I thought you must've been busy

831
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:47,751
I wanted to come and help

832
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:50,750
I planned to come yesterday

833
01:29:50,751 --> 01:29:54,833
But my tractor was held up in Xiaoyi

834
01:29:54,834 --> 01:29:57,666
I know you're quite busy

835
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:00,417
So I thought I'd do it myself...

836
01:30:00,459 --> 01:30:03,291
rather than to wait for you
when it's getting so hot

837
01:30:03,292 --> 01:30:05,124
Did you plough all the fields?

838
01:30:05,125 --> 01:30:07,250
Yes, they're all done

839
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:08,791
What are you going to plant this year?

840
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:12,250
We're planting maize and sorghum

841
01:30:12,584 --> 01:30:15,792
There's been plenty of rain this year

842
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:24,791
How about millet?

843
01:30:24,792 --> 01:30:26,042
Sure

844
01:30:26,918 --> 01:30:29,334
We'll grow more millet, for sure

845
01:30:29,417 --> 01:30:32,209
Millet fetches a good price

846
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:36,167
There's been plenty of rain this year

847
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:38,709
I do plan to grow more millet

848
01:30:38,751 --> 01:30:41,042
Right, this area is great for millet

849
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:43,959
What else can we grow here?

850
01:30:44,375 --> 01:30:47,918
It's harder to husk sorghum and corn

851
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:50,209
The market for millet is strong

852
01:30:50,334 --> 01:30:53,417
And there's hay, good for feeding livestock

853
01:31:05,709 --> 01:31:09,000
Get up! Give us a hand

854
01:31:09,626 --> 01:31:12,918
We only just came back

855
01:31:13,751 --> 01:31:16,459
Had a good snooze

856
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:24,000
Dad, have a smoke

857
01:31:26,876 --> 01:31:29,167
Brother, here you are

858
01:31:30,417 --> 01:31:32,876
Xiao Wu, try one

859
01:31:42,667 --> 01:31:44,541
What kind of cigarette is this?

860
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:47,250
- It's Marlboro
- Marlboro?

861
01:31:47,959 --> 01:31:49,291
How much is one pack?

862
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:51,918
- 12 yuan, they're American
- 12?

863
01:31:52,042 --> 01:31:56,667
That's as much as a whole
carton of Princess brand!

864
01:31:57,125 --> 01:32:00,791
How can it be worth that much?

865
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:02,667
Is it some special tobacco?

866
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:06,124
No, this is the cheapest brand in America

867
01:32:06,125 --> 01:32:08,209
That's how much it costs

868
01:32:15,959 --> 01:32:20,542
Erbao and his wife work for the state

869
01:32:20,751 --> 01:32:25,334
They drink coffee and
eat cakes all the time

870
01:32:26,042 --> 01:32:28,708
Imported cigarettes are
no big deal for them

871
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,751
Sister, you're wrong,
money's hard to come by in the city too

872
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:35,125
- I didn't mean it, sorry
- Never mind

873
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:39,999
Enough talk, is the food ready? Let's eat

874
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,667
Wait, it's still cooking

875
01:32:41,834 --> 01:32:43,166
It'll be done very soon

876
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:45,792
Erbao, when did you buy the ring?

877
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,209
How could I afford it?
It was a gift from her ma

878
01:32:51,751 --> 01:32:54,250
Can I take a look?
How much did it cost?

879
01:32:54,292 --> 01:32:57,792
It's an imitation, 18k gold-plated

880
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,375
Ma, where's your ring?

881
01:33:10,542 --> 01:33:12,459
I've put it away

882
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,834
Show me

883
01:33:14,959 --> 01:33:16,958
Wasn't it a gift to me?

884
01:33:16,959 --> 01:33:18,541
Yes, I gave it to you

885
01:33:18,542 --> 01:33:20,584
But not so you could
give it to someone else

886
01:33:20,792 --> 01:33:23,250
I haven't given it to anyone

887
01:33:23,417 --> 01:33:25,542
Then what ring is my
brother's fiancée wearing?

888
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:29,042
I've been in here, how should I know?

889
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:32,125
Show me the ring anyway

890
01:33:33,459 --> 01:33:35,042
Are you forcing me?

891
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:38,375
- No, I'm not - I should have
never raised a black sheep like you

892
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:42,083
Do you know how I earned the money?

893
01:33:42,542 --> 01:33:43,666
Show me the ring

894
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:45,834
You want it back? I don't have it

895
01:33:45,959 --> 01:33:47,667
Show it to me

896
01:33:47,751 --> 01:33:49,333
You want to destroy this family?

897
01:33:49,334 --> 01:33:51,208
Both family and state have rules

898
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:52,834
How did I raise such a disobedient kid?

899
01:33:52,876 --> 01:33:57,834
I should've drowned you in urine at birth!
I'll kill you with a rolling pin

900
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,791
Do you know who you are?

901
01:33:59,792 --> 01:34:02,542
You're the son of Liang Changyou!

902
01:34:02,792 --> 01:34:06,292
If you're not my son,
get the hell out and stay out!

903
01:34:06,834 --> 01:34:08,999
You unfilial son...

904
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,125
I won't come back!

905
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:12,083
Don't!

906
01:34:12,167 --> 01:34:13,501
I'll never come back!

907
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:15,834
Never ever!

908
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,501
Zhang Wenhuai reporting for Shanxi Radio

909
01:34:34,584 --> 01:34:38,374
With a brand new look to welcome
the return of Hong Kong...

910
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:40,708
the 15th Party Congress
has concluded successfully

911
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:45,458
Xinzhou Prefectural Administrative Office has
decided to prioritize the building of urban culture

912
01:34:45,459 --> 01:34:49,501
The policy will be promoted widely

913
01:34:52,334 --> 01:35:00,334
Anyone who wants a slice of pork,
