1
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:03,949
Oh, no.

2
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:09,354
Bad news, I guess.
Sign here, please.

3
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:11,223
What? Here.

4
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,993
Where it says, "received by."

5
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:17,162
My brother's lost his mind.
The doctor says it's permanent.

6
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:20,432
I'm putting him away.
The minute he's committed, I'll be rich.

7
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:24,269
I'm his executor.
I'll handle all his money.

8
00:02:24,303 --> 00:02:28,240
I'll start now.
I'll get commitment papers signed.

9
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:32,511
That's easy.
But a judgment from a court takes time.

10
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:35,948
I don't get paid
if you don't sign.

11
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:39,919
Are you from them,
or are you just a messenger?

12
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,487
Who are you, anyway?
I'll find out for you, if you like.

13
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:46,258
Oh, it's of no consequence,
old sport. Don't bother.

14
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,427
As you wish.

15
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,595
Doesn't anybody sign this?

16
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,898
I'll be glad to. Oh, thank you.

17
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,902
Don't you have a handkerchief?

18
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,338
Not on my salary.

19
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:01,340
Oh, thank you.

20
00:03:01,373 --> 00:03:03,308
By the way,

21
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:05,444
you suffer from lumbago.

22
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,688
You're hagridden by your wife,
you keep a sheepdog for a pet,

23
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:10,449
and you had chicken soup
for breakfast.

24
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,017
I just love it when you do that.

25
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:16,688
Yes, he's a messenger,
all right. Ahh!

26
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,224
Blackmail.

27
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,960
Just what I've been waiting for.

28
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,531
"Never!

29
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:31,336
Not one penny!"

30
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,539
- Really, Justin.
- Don't be frightened. I'll protect you.

31
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:37,943
Here. Give them this.

32
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:42,281
Oh, if that's a message,
I've gotta charge you for it, sir.

33
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:45,250
Give that dog of yours
more, uh, meat.

34
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:47,652
I think he's got pellagra.

35
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,656
Oh, bless you, sir. Bless you.

36
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,561
Don't touch it. It's my clue.

37
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:58,964
I, uh, shan't be up for lunch.

38
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:00,599
We're going to the clinic.

39
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:03,702
If you need me, I'll be downstairs
in the laboratory. Wait!

40
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:07,706
The clinic?
Oh, not another specialist.

41
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,674
I'm always so afraid
they'll make him well.

42
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,510
I like him this way.

43
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,645
Get him, will you, Daisy?

44
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:16,715
Something's wrong. I know it.

45
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:19,451
I can always tell
when something's wrong.

46
00:04:19,484 --> 00:04:21,386
You're in awful trouble,
aren't you?

47
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,687
Just go get him.

48
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:29,494
Oh, you were such a nice man
when I married you.

49
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:32,131
Do what I tell you to.
I've had enough.

50
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,133
We're going straight
to Dr. Strauss.

51
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,635
Land sakes alive.

52
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,403
There isn't any doubt, is there?

53
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:42,541
My goodness. No, indeedy.
He's incurably psychotic.

54
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,009
That means he's committable?

55
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:47,546
And then some.
Is there room here for him?

56
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,749
Always room for one more,
Mr. Playfair.

57
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:53,018
Especially for kin of yours.

58
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,654
You see, there's a spider
up there.

59
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:57,689
There.

60
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:02,094
He's got huge teeth,
and he's coming at me!

61
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,163
Doctor. He's coming at me.

62
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:07,032
He's coming at me!
Doctor. Mildred.

63
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:11,036
Oh! Now, is that what
your dream was like?

64
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,174
- Mildred. Mildred.
- Dr. Strauss, I am with a patient!

65
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:19,144
This here is Mr. Playfair,
an important member of our board.

66
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:22,081
How do you do, Mr. Playfair?
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

67
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,450
It's about my brother.
He's a hopeless paranoid.

68
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:26,818
Is that your
medical opinion, sir?

69
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,821
It's the consensus
of your staff.

70
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:33,058
He has a sizable estate
he isn't fit to handle.

71
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:35,460
It's my duty to commit him,
and, uh,

72
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:38,763
I need your signature.

73
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,632
Without examining the patient?

74
00:05:40,665 --> 00:05:43,435
That was never in my mind.
He's upstairs waiting.

75
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,370
Well, I have another
patient waiting.

76
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:46,738
Have them bring him down.

77
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:51,610
This gentleman is Mr. Small.

78
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:56,115
We're having some trouble
getting him to verbalize.

79
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,217
Is that correct, Mr. Small?

80
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,587
He can speak, but he just won't.

81
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:06,091
Now, Mr. Small cannot afford
to go to another doctor.

82
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,728
All my life I have worked with
people who have no place else to go.

83
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:11,763
I'm sorry to seem unreasonable.

84
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:14,166
But if you want me,
you'll have to wait for me.

85
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,602
I expect you better finish
with him later, Mildred.

86
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,772
Dr. Strauss, you are a money raiser.
Go and raise money!

87
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,807
I am a doctor.
Leave me to my work!

88
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,444
Nurse, take him to the ward.

89
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,650
He stays with me.

90
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:35,454
Now, ma'am, you are
flouting my authority.

91
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:37,122
It's all right.

92
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:39,858
Y'all take this poor
unfortunate away, you hear?

93
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,693
Not in my office, you don't!

94
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:45,264
- That's an order!
- No. Oh, Mr. Small!

95
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:47,532
Mr. Small! Oh!

96
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,668
Oh!

97
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,138
Oh, no. Oh! Oh.

98
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:55,874
Oh, you fool!
You've ruined weeks of work.

99
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:58,543
You ape!
Get that thing off of him.

100
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,479
Release that man.

101
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:05,450
No one belongs in one of those.

102
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:11,256
If you please. Hah! Esh! Hah!

103
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,894
Hyah!

104
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,235
A classic paranoid. Fantastic.

105
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:25,470
I don't think
I've ever done it better.

106
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,539
Well, now.

107
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,709
They'll think twice next time.
Are you all right?

108
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,279
Who let this happen?
Who's in charge here?

109
00:07:34,313 --> 00:07:36,815
Mr. Small, I'm so sorry.

110
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:38,583
Can you forgive me?

111
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:41,186
Don't let her off so lightly.

112
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,954
Is she decent to you?

113
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:45,257
You like her?

114
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,859
She didn't do this
to you, then, hmm?

115
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:49,228
Who did?

116
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:55,600
- You did.
- I guess you're really Sherlock Holmes.

117
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:58,770
You don't at all. You think I'm mad.
You analysts are all alike.

118
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,839
Thinks you're mad, too,
I suppose, huh?

119
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:04,209
Why? Because you won't talk?
Huh. Typical.

120
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,878
Why is it analysts
can't ever analyze?

121
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,748
Don't tell me you've deduced
what's wrong with Mr. Small.

122
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,716
Not yet. I can do if you like.

123
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,785
Will you nod when I'm right?

124
00:08:13,818 --> 00:08:17,889
Now, why should an obviously
proper gentleman refuse to talk?

125
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:20,725
Because he hasn't been
introduced.

126
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,695
We don't know who you are, but
once we do know, then you'll talk.

127
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:25,897
Now, where is the logic?

128
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,234
Think. He can talk,
but he won't.

129
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:31,536
The silence is the clue.

130
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,273
No coaching, please.
I work by pure deduction.

131
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,907
Now, who was silent?

132
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,777
Who had everything but sound?

133
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,780
The mutes of history? No,
they couldn't talk. He can.

134
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,982
A monk with vows of silence!

135
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:49,554
No, no. No sound, no sound.

136
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,923
Why, the early movies.

137
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:54,626
Why, the man's
a silent film star.

138
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,997
Which one? The most unlikely one.
It's only logical.

139
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,335
That means he's brave, hmm?
A man of action.

140
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:06,638
Stern, aloof, yet passionate.

141
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:11,810
By God. Rudolph Valentino.

142
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,745
Sherlock Holmes.

143
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:15,614
An honor, sir.

144
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:18,717
I've read your books. I'm
really quite a fan of yours.

145
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,886
I'll be damned.

146
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,357
Tell him how much you
liked him in The Sheik.

147
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,927
- This is ridiculous.
- You didn't like me?

148
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,896
Oh, no, no. You were very good.

149
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,898
I wish we had you
on the staff here.

150
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:35,800
You could use me.
Well, I must be off.

151
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:38,337
My best to Vilma Bánky.

152
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,340
Ah, ah, couldn't we just sit down and talk?
We could discuss your work.

153
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,074
I'm very sorry.
I'm a terribly busy man.

154
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:44,909
I don't have time
to be examined.

155
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:47,846
Are you working on a case? Better
save your strength for Mr. Small.

156
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,014
Chances are he isn't really Valentino.

157
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,451
Well, I like that. No offense.

158
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:55,720
I have daily office hours. If you
feel the need of a consultation,

159
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:58,657
please feel free to call
for an appointment.

160
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,949
Yes.

161
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:28,019
Yes, no clues of any kind.

162
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,889
It all points to Moriarty.

163
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,725
If only all the tests
are negative.

164
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,827
Damn.

165
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,963
Justin? Ten-to-one that moron
doctor wants to see me.

166
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:41,666
Someone's here
who wants to see you.

167
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,903
Holmes, why are you never wrong?

168
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,905
Really, Doctor,
do you have to see him?

169
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,474
Oh, absolutely. One good
session with him. I insist.

170
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:51,376
May we come in?

171
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:55,914
Right this way.

172
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:35,086
Amazing. Classic paranoia.
What an opportunity.

173
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:38,490
It's really sort of cozy.

174
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:40,425
Did he do all this himself?

175
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,429
Oh, I helped a little.
He's not here.

176
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:47,098
He's probably hiding.
Does he have a hiding place?

177
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:49,067
A secret panel. How'd you know?

178
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,436
Oh, they always do.

179
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,104
He'll come out when he's ready.

180
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:57,442
You say he used to be a lawyer, huh?

181
00:11:57,476 --> 00:12:00,144
And a judge.
He was a brilliant man.

182
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,482
It's just marvelous.

183
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,985
Oh, we shopped at Abercrombie's.

184
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,853
You'll just have to forgive me,

185
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,890
but I haven't seen
a classic since, oh,

186
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,592
the spring of '59.

187
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,027
They're very rare, you know.

188
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:20,164
How long has he been
Sherlock Holmes?

189
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,568
Since Lucy... Uh, since his wife died.
For about a year.

190
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,970
And how long does
each attack go on?

191
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:29,541
Oh, all day, every day.
He's never Justin anymore.

192
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:31,810
Do you remember when
the symptoms first started?

193
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:34,613
That's hard to say.
He was a great reformer.

194
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:37,015
Always out to make
things better, Justin was.

195
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,117
He, uh, lived on books.

196
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,953
Detective fiction mostly.

197
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:45,056
You don't think you can cure him,
do you?

198
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:47,058
Cure a classic?

199
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,127
Once in a generation.

200
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,630
It's a marvelous disease,
you know.

201
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:54,866
The victim's faculties
grow keener,

202
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,901
and-and ultrasensitive.

203
00:12:56,935 --> 00:13:01,506
And he's capable of things
that seem like genius.

204
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,008
Where's the secret panel?
Oh, he won't tell us.

205
00:13:05,143 --> 00:13:09,848
Watch, I'll bring him out.

206
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,051
You see, the classic
changes his identity.

207
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:18,256
And everything is very mysterious,
and there's evil lurking everywhere.

208
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:22,160
And dollars to doughnuts behind
it all is Professor Moriarty.

209
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,095
Give her money for a taxi.
Send her home.

210
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,101
You be nice now.

211
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:32,136
Will you be taking me
to mesmerizers next?

212
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,072
If you'll excuse us, hmm?

213
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,007
We'll be upstairs, Doctor.

214
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:48,653
I don't suppose there's any point
in asking you to go.

215
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:52,023
You don't mind if I get on with my work?
Oh, no. Go right ahead.

216
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:55,694
The usual procedure is to start
off with family questions.

217
00:13:55,727 --> 00:14:00,298
Background data, childhood
recollections, traumas and the like.

218
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:03,001
Well, come, come.
Ask me anything you like.

219
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:05,970
I'm at your service.

220
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,906
What are you doing?

221
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:10,942
Just routine.
It wouldn't interest you.

222
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,244
Why don't we start off
with my father?

223
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:15,146
Why? Does it bother you
to talk about him?

224
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:17,281
Not in the least.
What would you like to know?

225
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:21,920
Ah, well, um, a stern man, wasn't he?
Aloof and cold?

226
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:23,673
I really couldn't say.
I don't remember him.

227
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:28,259
Well, uh, your mother
must've been a lovely woman.

228
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:29,994
What's your earliest memory of her?

229
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:33,364
I haven't any.
None? You don't remember her at all?

230
00:14:33,397 --> 00:14:36,100
No more, I'd say,
than you remember yours.

231
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:37,902
Your father raised you,
didn't he?

232
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:40,905
I'd say he was a doctor too.
Country practice, Midwest.

233
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:43,307
You're not bad.
It isn't guesswork, either.

234
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,376
It's observation
of detail, deduction.

235
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:48,312
Couldn't that paper wait?
I often do two things at once.

236
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,249
If necessary,
I can manage three or four.

237
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:54,686
Now, about your wife. What wife?

238
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,021
You know, I have a feeling
you're resisting me.

239
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:00,058
Because I can't recall
a wife I never had?

240
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:04,062
Let's see now:
Kentucky pulp, rag content zero,

241
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:07,398
12-pound weight, produced
for Woolworth's, 39 a box.

242
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:09,734
That's interesting.

243
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:11,712
Do you really believe that paper
came from Woolworth's?

244
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:14,305
Where do you think it came from?
I have no opinion.

245
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:16,407
Yes, you do.
You think I'm wrong.

246
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,043
Well, I take it a great many
people think you're wrong.

247
00:15:19,077 --> 00:15:22,213
Don't you have anything to do?
I'm doing it.

248
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:30,188
Now, what is that?
Is that a clue?

249
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,190
Yes, it is a clue.

250
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,192
Well, tell me about it.

251
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,327
I'm a patient, humble,
understanding man.

252
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,339
Why don't you come back next week, and I'll
play 20 questions with you all you like.

253
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:43,668
I love games. I always have.
But not today.

254
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:45,970
No, not when
it's life and death.

255
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:50,441
Are you in danger?

256
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:54,245
There's a master plan,
and that is the master clue.

257
00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:57,348
It holds the date and time and place
where he lies waiting for me.

258
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:01,019
- Who?
- Professor Moriarty.

259
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:02,787
He taunts me, Doctor.

260
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:04,765
He could kill me anytime. He
has his agents everywhere.

261
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,359
But no. No. He wants another
kind of victory first.

262
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:10,237
Those two words, "twenty
grand," are a challenge,

263
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,197
and he wants to see me fail.

264
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,700
I've got to find their meaning
and be waiting, ready for him.

265
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:18,436
If I don't, I die.

266
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:21,239
I take it you've met
face to face before?

267
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,142
I really couldn't say.
The man is a master of disguise.

268
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,244
That's going to make him
very difficult to catch.

269
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,112
I wouldn't have him
any other way.

270
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:30,124
He's the greatest enemy a man could have.
He's everywhere!

271
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:31,415
Here, look.

272
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:37,722
Uh... "Girl Scout killed
crossing street."

273
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,725
Uh... "Grandmother raped
and beaten." Huh?

274
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,295
Uh... "Orphanage in flames,
five die."

275
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:48,432
"Excursion boat explodes." Who-Who
does these things? Who's responsible?

276
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,168
Well, they might be accidents.

277
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:52,270
I don't believe in accidents.

278
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,739
Take Mr. Small, for instance.
How did I bring that off?

279
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,108
'Cause there are
two laws in life.

280
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,143
All things are logical.
They must make sense.

281
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:01,512
And no things are ever
exactly what they seem.

282
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:05,249
Each accident
is part of a design.

283
00:17:05,283 --> 00:17:08,853
And every object has
its secret side.

284
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:11,823
Was that how you did it?
Is it so insane?

285
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:13,892
Oh, I didn't use that word.

286
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:16,060
Yes, but you think it.
That's what brought you here.

287
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:18,396
No, I came here
because your brother...

288
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:21,299
You do have a brother,
don't you?

289
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,801
Blevins. Yes, of course.

290
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,437
You've remembered something
from your past.

291
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,430
I know all about my past,
and Blevins isn't in it.

292
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,775
He's not in
"The Speckled Band" or...

293
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,311
Check it out. I've been
completely written up.

294
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,380
Still, if he needs to think
we're brothers, let him use me.

295
00:17:36,414 --> 00:17:39,317
I can answer when he calls me Justin.
After all, it's only a name.

296
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,419
Do many people call you Holmes?

297
00:17:43,888 --> 00:17:46,324
No, scarcely anyone.

298
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,860
That must make you
very much alone.

299
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,796
It does that, but it
doesn't make me wrong.

300
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,799
I've listened to so many doctors
tell me who I am.

301
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,477
I've studied Justin Playfair. I've read
all his books, his papers, his decisions.

302
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,804
Everything he did.

303
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:03,574
He tried to make the world the
kind of place it might have been.

304
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:07,879
It drove him mad.
He lost his mind.

305
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:11,115
But I am not that man.

306
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:13,184
I'd like to visit you
from time to time.

307
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,819
What for?
I don't need doctoring.

308
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,420
Mr. Holmes...

309
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:18,857
Don't call me that.
You don't believe I'm Holmes.

310
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,226
- I won't be patronized.
- You don't have to snap at me.

311
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,462
A lunatic is entitled to his temper!
Go away!

312
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:26,564
I want to help you.

313
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,967
"Twenty grand." A sum of
money, but what else?

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,369
I'm on your side.
Nobody's on my side.

315
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,138
Ah, the whole world
is against you. Typical.

316
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:36,407
Now, when did this sense
of persecution start?

317
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,509
When you walked in.

318
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:42,146
If you're not careful,
I'm going to walk right out.

319
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,849
Woman, I have got to think! My
life depends on what I think.

320
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,918
Your life depends on me.

321
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:49,287
Well, God help me, then. **

322
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,356
Oh! Put down
that ridiculous violin.

323
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:56,194
Holmes fiddles when he thinks.

324
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,396
That's awful.

325
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,199
But I absolutely cannot
play the goddamn thing!

326
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:05,403
Stop laughing at me.

327
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,405
- I'm not laughing.
- I'll show you.

328
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:11,209
That paper is real. Moriarty's real.
I am not mad.

329
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:14,545
You want to test me out?
Let's test me out on you.

330
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,948
Very well.
You'll tell me when I'm wrong.

331
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,583
I'll shake when wrong and nod
when right, like Mr. Small.

332
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,520
Are you ready? Go right ahead.

333
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:25,356
You're left-handed.

334
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:29,260
Your molars and incisors,
lower right, are false.

335
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,329
You tint your hair and
have a vitamin deficiency.

336
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:35,199
You were a tomboy and an only child.
Your adolescence was a nightmare.

337
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,535
And you didn't lose your
acne until your middle-20s.

338
00:19:37,568 --> 00:19:40,638
You can neither cook nor sew, and your
apartment needs a thorough cleaning.

339
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,574
You suffer from insomnia and
sometimes drink yourself to sleep.

340
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,685
You think you're homely and
you're glad you're growing old.

341
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:47,454
You bite your nails. You're
frightened you're a failure,

342
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,047
but you're lost
without your work.

343
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,349
I've got more. Do you want it?
By all means.

344
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:56,921
You haven't any friends.

345
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,589
You have never been engaged.

346
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:02,560
No one you've loved
has ever loved you back.

347
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:05,496
You're stubborn and inflexible.

348
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,331
You've got a temper
that you can't control.

349
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:10,634
That suit is 10 years old, and you
annoy the living Jesus out of me.

350
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:18,943
Now it's my turn.

351
00:20:18,977 --> 00:20:21,079
I'm going to stay right here.

352
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:23,514
Go, stay. What you do
doesn't interest me.

353
00:20:23,547 --> 00:20:26,417
- The hell it doesn't.
- I forgot. You swear.

354
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,253
Listen, my name is Watson,
Mildred Watson.

355
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:32,490
I'm a doctor. I'm not beautiful
or rich or ambitious,

356
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,259
and about the only thing I
care about in life is to cure.

357
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,528
Now, I have offered you
what skills I have,

358
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:41,032
and in return you have fought and jeered
and tried to hurt me. But never mind.

359
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:43,101
I don't care.
All I feel is dedication.

360
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:45,569
Watson? Shut up. I
am not finished.

361
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:49,540
I am a dedicated doctor, sir, and
I will cure you if it kills me!

362
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:51,675
Watson? No, that's impossible.

363
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,078
I mean, good Lord, I am
the underdog, but this...

364
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,380
Are you quite sure
you're Dr. Watson?

365
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:59,083
You are to show up in my office
tomorrow morning at 10:00!

366
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:01,552
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You just won't do.

367
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:04,022
There must be some mistake.
Here's my address.

368
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,658
Fool. Fool! It's an address!

369
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:10,394
Twenty Grand is an address.
Are you ready, Watson?

370
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:13,031
What? We haven't any time to lose.
Come on.

371
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,433
Well, aren't you coming with me?

372
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:17,435
It's going to be
my greatest case.

373
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:20,004
You wouldn't want to miss
the chance to write it up.

374
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,507
She'll come. She's coming.
There she is.

375
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,143
My chronicler
and good right arm.

376
00:21:25,176 --> 00:21:27,311
Frankly, I'm a little
disappointed.

377
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:30,414
But if anyone can make a detective
out of you, I'm the man. Let's go.

378
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,357
Come along, Watson.
Where's your pluck?

379
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,625
Well, I ought to call
the clinic.

380
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,662
They'll never miss you.
Follow me.

381
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:47,165
We're coming for you, Moriarty.

382
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:51,335
We may not look like much. We may not have
your weapons. We may lack your dark allies.

383
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,038
Why, we may even lose.

384
00:21:54,072 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm not invincible.
God knows she's no asset.

385
00:21:56,574 --> 00:22:00,178
But together, sir,
we may surprise you.

386
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:02,746
Do your worst. We're on our way.

387
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,682
Watch out.

388
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:11,522
Where are we going? Grand
Street, naturally. 20 Grand.

389
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:13,591
What are we going to do
when we get there?

390
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,735
If I'm right, we'll find the
meaning of the master clue.

391
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,729
You can't just barge in.
I never barge.

392
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:22,633
I infiltrate. I filter. Here.

393
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,502
You better practice.
Walk like this.

394
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:37,415
What if it's somebody's home?

395
00:22:37,448 --> 00:22:39,483
We'll visit.

396
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:42,086
Or a store? We'll browse.

397
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,655
What if somebody... I'll do
the thinking, thank you.

398
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,475
You're not practicing.

399
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,121
I can't afford to be seen creeping
along the street in broad daylight.

400
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:09,113
Well, you must be good
for something.

401
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:11,882
Are you any good with firearms?
Guns?

402
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:16,454
I don't suppose you know very much about
jiujitsu, either. No, you wouldn't.

403
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:20,858
If I'm such a liability, what do you
want me for? You mustn't feel inferior.

404
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:23,694
Try saying to yourself,
"I'm adequate."

405
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,663
Mr. Playfair, really.

406
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,800
Come on. Try.

407
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,603
I'm adequate. Good girl.

408
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:03,167
Here. Oh, great Caesar's ghost.

409
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,703
Strange things go on in
Greenwich Village. Take it.

410
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,838
It's not loaded, is it?

411
00:24:07,871 --> 00:24:10,274
Well, I can't shoot down
Moriarty with imaginary shells.

412
00:24:10,308 --> 00:24:12,576
Now, catlike, on your toes.

413
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,645
We've got to find the clue.

414
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:17,515
What if there isn't one?
There will be.

415
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:19,517
Moriarty won't disappoint me.

416
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,585
Well, if you don't know
what you're looking for...

417
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:24,855
Half the trick in finding clues
is knowing that they're there.

418
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:26,524
Ah!

419
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,195
Ah, we're getting closer now.

420
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:33,731
How innocent these houses look.

421
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,733
That's bad.

422
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,935
The worst things always
seem like innocence.

423
00:24:45,343 --> 00:24:46,910
Look!

424
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,313
What do you think?

425
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:54,252
It's the telephone company.

426
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:57,221
Just the place he'd leave
a message for me.

427
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:58,922
You're not going
to cause a scene?

428
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:09,700
The essence of method
lies in quiet and surprise.

429
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:12,370
Can't we talk this over
in my office, please?

430
00:25:12,403 --> 00:25:14,643
They're expecting us. Remember,
be prepared for anything.

431
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:44,335
Now, don't shoot unless
it's absolutely necessary.

432
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:49,807
Information. May I help you?

433
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,310
Please, you've got to talk to me.
You've got to listen.

434
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:54,378
Sorry, we may not divulge
that information.

435
00:25:54,412 --> 00:25:56,947
You've just got
to help me find him.

436
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,719
Miss, I told you when you called. We
cannot give that information on the phone.

437
00:26:01,752 --> 00:26:03,987
But that's why I came here.
I'm not on the phone now.

438
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,890
So you'll tell me, won't you?
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

439
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:09,627
We only give out information
on the telephone.

440
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,662
But you refused to give it
to me on the telephone.

441
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,732
I'm sorry. If you wanna talk to me,
you'll have to call me on the telephone.

442
00:26:14,765 --> 00:26:17,368
All right. Where is the telephone?
Right there.

443
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:19,837
Listen to the misery.

444
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,740
That means we're getting close.

445
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:24,442
Let's see if there's a message.

446
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:26,844
Madam, the crash is out of town.

447
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,680
You need long distance
information.

448
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,882
Have you anything for me?

449
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:34,385
The input's on the fritz. I think
the rheostats are shorting.

450
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:37,921
You see? I knew
they were expecting us.

451
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:39,823
The game begins.

452
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:42,993
Oh, no. You can't do that.
My clue is inside.

453
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:45,329
Information. May I help you?

454
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:47,331
You've got to help me, please.

455
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:50,668
I don't know where he lives,
but we're in love.

456
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,069
He called me half an hour ago.

457
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:54,338
He just found out
he failed his bar exam.

458
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:58,876
He's taken sleeping pills.

459
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,712
He said good-bye. He's dying,
and he isn't in the phone book.

460
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,347
He's probably unlisted.

461
00:27:03,381 --> 00:27:06,116
We've saved him.
What's his number?

462
00:27:06,149 --> 00:27:09,353
Sorry, we may not divulge
unlisted numbers.

463
00:27:09,387 --> 00:27:11,789
His address. Forget the number.
Give me his address.

464
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:14,358
I'm sorry. No addresses
on the telephone.

465
00:27:14,392 --> 00:27:16,460
But I'm not on the telephone.
I'm here!

466
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,696
We only give out information
on the telephone.

467
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:20,097
I can't go on.

468
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,733
This is unendurable.

469
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,370
You there. Give me
the unlisted list.

470
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:28,382
Send a guard
to the information room.

471
00:27:28,406 --> 00:27:30,674
You, then. At once.

472
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:39,383
- Why, you care.
- I do.

473
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:41,985
I'm finished here.

474
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,956
It doesn't matter. Here.

475
00:27:45,989 --> 00:27:48,926
Take it.

476
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,795
Here, child.

477
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:54,131
My name is Grace.

478
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:56,133
I wish I had something beautiful
to give you.

479
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,871
But I don't.

480
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,742
Okay, girls, what's the trouble?

481
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:06,744
It's the repairman.

482
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:08,812
What repairman?

483
00:28:08,846 --> 00:28:11,815
Mr. Playfair, do something.

484
00:28:11,849 --> 00:28:14,418
Draw your pistol, Watson.
Keep him covered. I will not.

485
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,954
They got guns. Call the cops.
Right.

486
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,557
What's their number?

487
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,793
Fool. He's got my clue. Uh...

488
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,762
Excuse me, that magazine
you're holding.

489
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:27,731
Stop right there. I don't
suppose you'd let me see it.

490
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:30,968
It's a Double-Crostic.
I haven't finished it yet.

491
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,471
You know the crosswords
in the London Times?

492
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,474
Yeah, I-I heard about 'em.
They're the best.

493
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:40,778
Last Sunday. Here.
Have a look. Oh.

494
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:47,785
Oh. Oh!

495
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,487
Hello, police. Help, murder.

496
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,822
Aw. Run for it!

497
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,057
How do I know what precinct?

498
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:56,960
I can't call information.
I am information.

499
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,887
Watson, your first impression
of detective work.

500
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,156
You like it? No.

501
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:29,860
Good girl. I know how girls are.
"No" means "yes."

502
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,163
I haven't been a girl in 20 years,
and when I say no, I mean no!

503
00:29:33,196 --> 00:29:35,132
You have any notion
of what you've done?

504
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:37,635
I found two clues: A Double-crostic
and a girl named Grace.

505
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:39,870
You could've jeopardized
my whole career.

506
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,607
Wasn't much of a career from what I
could see of it. Now, hold the phone.

507
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,643
Grace. What could Grace mean?

508
00:29:45,676 --> 00:29:48,512
Do you realize that
I have been published?

509
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:50,914
And that I have three degrees.

510
00:29:50,948 --> 00:29:53,984
And that I've... I've had a
Rockefeller and a Guggenheim.

511
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:56,053
A-And I've studied in Vienna.

512
00:29:56,086 --> 00:30:00,157
Tuesday. It's tomorrow.
"Tuesday's child is full of grace."

513
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,192
We're meeting him tomorrow!
No, no, Mr. Playfair.

514
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:04,194
Listen. I'm no good
to you here. Really.

515
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:06,997
I-I can't work under these conditions.
Look at this place.

516
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,036
Okay, okay. What's going on?
Good morning, Officer.

517
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,138
Why, Mr. Rathbone.
It's an honor, sir.

518
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:17,107
They want you up the street
at number 20.

519
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,077
Ah, yes. I've just been there.

520
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,879
You're the ones. Quick thinking.

521
00:30:21,912 --> 00:30:24,057
I wonder, if you see them later,
would you give this back?

522
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,983
Oh, I'd...

523
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:45,869
She's unorthodox,
I'll grant you.

524
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:48,205
If she didn't bring him here,
where are they?

525
00:30:48,238 --> 00:30:52,142
Moseying along.
I expect they'll get here soon.

526
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:54,144
I've got to get
those papers signed.

527
00:30:54,177 --> 00:30:58,148
She'll sign 'em. Yes, indeedy.

528
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,148
I didn't write that.
Someone did.

529
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,249
My brother.

530
00:31:32,282 --> 00:31:34,251
Oh, that's just great!

531
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,755
He knows.
This nut knows all about me.

532
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:39,957
He'll be in a cell.
What can he do?

533
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,259
You get his money
if he dies, right?

534
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:45,629
Where's he at? He's disappeared.

535
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:48,632
All right, here's how it is.

536
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:52,202
You find him first,
it's the loony bin for life.

537
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:55,138
I find him first and...

538
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,610
Let's go!

539
00:32:05,315 --> 00:32:07,284
Get that guy
in the hotel window.

540
00:32:07,317 --> 00:32:10,353
He's got me pinned down.

541
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,656
Ah. Where are we?

542
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,725
Eh, last reel. The ambush scene.

543
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:17,127
Is that a screen back there?
We're five flights up.

544
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,063
I know. I counted 'em.

545
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:22,241
It's that vitamin deficiency. You
ought to eat more leafy things.

546
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:26,203
- Here, hold on. I know the way.
- Shh!

547
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,339
Oh, my God, Justin. Is he dead? He's
quite all right. He lives here.

548
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:32,009
What? All the time?
Except for Saturdays.

549
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:33,452
You see, we have no showers
in the men's room,

550
00:32:33,476 --> 00:32:36,213
so he bathes
in Pennsylvania Station.

551
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,415
Here, uh, have a sweet.

552
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:41,218
Oh, man. Not again.

553
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,021
Do it again.
God, what are they doing?

554
00:32:44,054 --> 00:32:46,256
Shut your trap
and watch the movie!

555
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:49,059
It's all right, Maud.
She's with me.

556
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,761
Why, Mr. Holmes.

557
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:54,231
Oh, you missed a lovely
one yesterday.

558
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,233
Oh, it's good to have you back, sir.

559
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,703
Thank you, Maud. Have some
popcorn while it's hot.

560
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:01,705
No, thank you.

561
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:04,441
What's wrong? Nothing.

562
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:07,044
Well, we missed lunch. You
really ought to have something.

563
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:09,312
I'm an adult.
I can feed myself, all right?

564
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:12,215
Oh, sorry. No offense.

565
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:13,717
Just watch the movie, all right?

566
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:18,488
Watson?

567
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:21,358
Why so moody?

568
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:27,765
You're not watching. You can't see
a thing without your glasses.

569
00:33:35,906 --> 00:33:38,742
Watson? Yes.

570
00:33:38,776 --> 00:33:41,411
Regardless of your feelings
on the matter, I...

571
00:33:41,444 --> 00:33:45,148
have enjoyed
collaborating with you,

572
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:47,317
and I'm very pleased
that you're here.

573
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,120
I wouldn't be here
except for the police.

574
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,756
Yes, I am sorry about that.

575
00:33:55,793 --> 00:33:58,295
What am I going to do with you?

576
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,731
You might try smiling. Nothing
much, just once a day or so.

577
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:08,305
I will have some candy.
Help yourself.

578
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,540
Oh, it's Jujyfruits.

579
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:13,276
I broke three sets
of braces on those.

580
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,246
She'll be there!
She'll save you!

581
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:22,185
God bless you, Barbara Stanwyck.

582
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,187
You want to know something?

583
00:34:24,221 --> 00:34:25,856
You were right about
my adolescence.

584
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,359
It was awful.

585
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:34,832
And my apartment is a mess,
and I can't cook.

586
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,235
You like the movies, hmm?

587
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:40,270
Only westerns.

588
00:34:40,303 --> 00:34:43,573
All the other doctors
found it most amusing.

589
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:45,475
I don't find it amusing,
just curious.

590
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:47,811
It isn't even that.

591
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:52,149
If you look closely down there,
Watson, you can see principles.

592
00:34:52,182 --> 00:34:54,384
You see the possibility
of justice and proportion.

593
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,453
You can see men move
their own lives.

594
00:34:56,486 --> 00:34:59,122
There are no masses
in Virginia City.

595
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:02,926
Only individuals whose will
for good for bad...

596
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,896
can bring them to the ends
they ought to have.

597
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:08,565
I like that very much.

598
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:15,138
Why did I have to meet you now?

599
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:18,241
What's wrong with now? We're
together, and we're after Moriarty.

600
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:20,210
There isn't any Moriarty.
There is!

601
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,212
You dreamt him up!

602
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,147
If I am Holmes, there has
got to be a Moriarty.

603
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:26,216
Well, what if you're not Holmes?

604
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:30,287
Let me see now. One word left blank.
"Electric News," 11 letters.

605
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,455
Justin, I want to help you.

606
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:35,158
Would you please
just let me try?

607
00:35:35,192 --> 00:35:38,628
Think, man!

608
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:40,597
Oh, man.

609
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,009
Man, I gotta groove or blow my mind.
Let's go someplace and groove.

610
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:44,434
Oh, let's groove here.

611
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:47,404
Groovy. Groovy.

612
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,872
What's groove?

613
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:54,211
My god!

614
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:58,448
Madam, you are creating
a disturbance. Shh!

615
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:01,618
- But they're grooving!
- Madam, I warned you. Usher!

616
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:04,287
Usher!

617
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,900
- Hey, this woman's the fuzz. I'm gonna bust her one.
- No, I'm not. No.

618
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:09,192
This woman woke me up.

619
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:10,536
You makin' trouble, huh?
No, I'm not.

620
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,595
- Shh!
- Out! Out!

621
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:16,233
No! Justin! Okay, mom.

622
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:17,567
I've got it! Watson, quick.

623
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,370
Where is my shoe?

624
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:23,240
Why, it's Mr. Holmes.

625
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:24,641
We're coming, Moriarty!

626
00:36:24,674 --> 00:36:27,477
Ew, all this gum.
It's like a swamp.

627
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,513
Stop dawdling!

628
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:33,951
I think they're growing mushrooms.
Damn it, Watson.

629
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,618
Justin, give me my shoe!

630
00:36:37,054 --> 00:36:39,222
My shoe!

631
00:36:44,361 --> 00:36:45,929
Against the wall. Get back.

632
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:47,931
I will not! This is idiotic.
Quiet!

633
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,933
I've got a run in my stocking.
Creep forward.

634
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:52,602
My feet hurt. Shut up.

635
00:36:52,635 --> 00:36:54,337
I want my shoe!

636
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:56,373
You want to get us killed?

637
00:36:56,406 --> 00:36:59,609
No, just one of us. I've
got a blister on my foot.

638
00:37:02,112 --> 00:37:03,947
Holmes, you are fantastic.

639
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:07,084
"Electric news," 11 letters.

640
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:08,952
Times Square.

641
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:25,535
Yes. Just the sort
of place he'd...

642
00:37:25,568 --> 00:37:27,971
Now, if I were Moriarty,
where would I...

643
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:30,307
Let's try him. Why him?

644
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,042
You never know.

645
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,712
I'd like a bag
of chestnuts, please.

646
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:39,482
I'm out of chestnuts. Odd. I
took you for a chestnut man.

647
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:42,552
I am a chestnut man. A chestnut
man who's out of chestnuts?

648
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:44,654
That's the picture.
There's no chestnuts.

649
00:37:44,687 --> 00:37:48,458
We're in luck. When is the
professor going to strike?

650
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:51,528
Tomorrow sometime.
Check the papers.

651
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,531
Midnight.
We meet tomorrow midnight.

652
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:57,000
It's not Moriarty who's striking.
It's Columbia.

653
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:59,436
He had to get the
message to me somehow.

654
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:02,005
Now, the clue that
leads us to the place.

655
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:06,576
He'd put it somewhere obvious but...
unexpected.

656
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,638
My clue, my clue.

657
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,815
Oh, my God!

658
00:39:30,693 --> 00:39:33,130
Taxi! Taxi!

659
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,432
Taxi!

660
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:38,101
Help!

661
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:41,671
- I'm off duty. Can't you read?
- Your sign says on.

662
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:43,773
Tough. I'm going back
to the garage.

663
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:47,844
Listen, I'm a doctor, this is an
emergency, and you can stuff it!

664
00:39:52,615 --> 00:39:54,651
Oh, he hurt you.

665
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,686
Nonsense. Never better.
Like a rock.

666
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,256
No, you look awful. Here.
Wait a minute. Here.

667
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,823
You look a little shot yourself.

668
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,193
No, it's all right.
I'll be all right in a minute.

669
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:06,163
Here. Have a nip.

670
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,499
I don't know what came over me.
Drink up.

671
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,692
I have never been like that
before in my life. Honestly.

672
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,179
I don't know what
you must think of me.

673
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,680
I think I'll make a detective
out of you yet.

674
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,207
Hey, no boozin' in my hack!

675
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,642
Speak when you're spoken to.

676
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:21,187
You came through
very nicely back there.

677
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,680
I'd like to thank you
for defending me.

678
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,549
I didn't defend you. I attacked them.
There's a difference.

679
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,685
It's all the same.

680
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,754
I wish you'd stop thanking
me for everything I do.

681
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:35,692
You are the touchy one, aren't you? You
don't want anyone to owe you anything.

682
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,260
Perhaps you ought
to be the analyst.

683
00:40:39,596 --> 00:40:42,199
Here. What do you make of it?

684
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:44,234
God, you're just like
Don Quixote.

685
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:46,303
You think everything
is always something else.

686
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,906
Well, he had a point. Of course,
he carried it a bit too far.

687
00:40:49,939 --> 00:40:53,476
That's all. He thought that
every windmill was a giant.

688
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,811
That's insane.

689
00:40:54,844 --> 00:40:57,580
But thinking
that they might be...

690
00:40:57,614 --> 00:41:01,218
Well, all the best minds
used to think the world was flat.

691
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:04,487
But what if it isn't?
It might be round.

692
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:06,689
And bread mold might
be medicine.

693
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:09,835
If we never looked at things and thought of what
they might be, why we'd all still be out...

694
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:11,761
in the tall grass with the apes.

695
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:14,731
Look, are we cruising,
taking in the sights, or what?

696
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:18,635
Sixth Avenue and 10th. And if you
want a nickel tip, keep talking.

697
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,945
Hey, wait a minute! My shoe!
Oh, to hell with it.

698
00:41:35,718 --> 00:41:37,520
Where are we?
What is this place?

699
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:51,000
Wilbur. Wilbur.

700
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:52,935
Your latest text on sanitation,
if you please.

701
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,004
I'll get it, Mr. Holmes.

702
00:41:55,037 --> 00:41:58,775
We're closing in. This time,
with any luck, he's mine.

703
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,877
You're meeting Moriarty?

704
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,979
It's happening at last.

705
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,918
Oh, this creature has
attached herself to me.

706
00:42:08,951 --> 00:42:10,753
You talk to her.

707
00:42:15,792 --> 00:42:17,660
Yes. I'm Dr. Watson.
How do you do?

708
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:19,662
Oh, how nice.

709
00:42:19,696 --> 00:42:21,764
No, I am Dr. Watson.

710
00:42:21,798 --> 00:42:24,267
Would you like to see
my driver's license?

711
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:26,269
He's waited for you
such a long time.

712
00:42:26,303 --> 00:42:28,805
I'm so glad he's found you.

713
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,308
Listen, I'm his doctor.
I'm a licensed analyst.

714
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,843
Of course you are, my dear.

715
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,790
There. "Dr. Watson."

716
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:52,295
Dr. Watson. Dr. Mildred Watson.

717
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:54,364
"Dr. Watson." It's me.

718
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:57,834
And now I've got you all upset.
I'm sorry, Doctor.

719
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,803
Who does he think you are,
Lestrade of Scotland Yard?

720
00:43:00,837 --> 00:43:04,307
He calls me Wilbur. It's my name.
Wilbur Peabody.

721
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,848
You don't know what I've been through.
And look at him!

722
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,951
Oblivious. He's like that
when he concentrates.

723
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,721
Have you known him very long?

724
00:43:18,755 --> 00:43:21,624
For over 30 years,
since he was very small.

725
00:43:21,658 --> 00:43:24,694
Oh, he was such
a serious young man.

726
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,896
The dustier the book,
the more he studied it.

727
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:31,734
Now he studies guns,
fisticuffs, acrobatics.

728
00:43:31,768 --> 00:43:34,003
Have you been hired
to cure him, Doctor?

729
00:43:35,772 --> 00:43:39,742
Just the opposite, I think.

730
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:43,746
I'm not quite sure I understand.

731
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,449
I'm not quite sure I do, either.

732
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,691
I've got my work! I'm busy!

733
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:56,826
And I'm satisfied.

734
00:43:56,859 --> 00:43:59,796
And I've got a perfectly
fascinating schizoid case at 8:00.

735
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:02,399
If I hurry, I'll make it.
Nothing. Damn!

736
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,768
Garbage.

737
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:08,771
Yes, it's garbage. That's all it is.
Garbage!

738
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:12,942
And I've had enough.
What's wrong with you?

739
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:17,480
I've lost my shoe. I've got
a gun in my pocketbook.

740
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:22,452
One minute you're all smiles,
and the next...

741
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:24,754
I'm going back
to where I belong.

742
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,756
The clinic?

743
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,925
Yes, the clinic.

744
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,094
And they're gonna put you in there, and
there's nothing I can do about it.

745
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:35,031
I cannot help you, because
I cannot make you well!

746
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,836
You don't think I'm insane.
Not you.

747
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:43,072
I'm Holmes.
I am Sherlock Holmes!

748
00:44:43,105 --> 00:44:46,108
I've got a patient waiting.

749
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,144
I'm a doctor. I heal the sick!

750
00:44:48,177 --> 00:44:52,081
Watson! Watson!

751
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:56,719
Silly woman. Go ahead!

752
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:00,122
I've always been alone.

753
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,029
- Wilbur?
- Yes, Mr. Holmes?

754
00:45:07,063 --> 00:45:11,100
What does garbage in a
shopping bag suggest to you?

755
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:21,844
But I'm much too old.

756
00:45:21,878 --> 00:45:24,080
I never think of you as old.

757
00:45:24,113 --> 00:45:26,449
Neither do I.

758
00:45:26,483 --> 00:45:29,552
But every morning when I see that old
face peering at me from the glass,

759
00:45:29,586 --> 00:45:31,554
I count my years, I tote 'em up,

760
00:45:31,588 --> 00:45:33,890
and sure enough, I come out old.

761
00:45:33,923 --> 00:45:36,225
You don't want me.

762
00:45:36,258 --> 00:45:38,227
Well, I don't...
I don't want anyone.

763
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,197
I have my errand.
I have Moriarty.

764
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,504
Come on, Professor.
Strike me now!

765
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,207
You see?

766
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,243
I frighten him.

767
00:45:54,276 --> 00:45:56,145
He knows what I can do.

768
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:04,086
Wilbur?

769
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,488
Yes?

770
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:11,828
She went away
in stockinged feet.

771
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:05,081
- Watson!
- Lord have mercy, Doctor.

772
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,650
Seemed like you
done disappeared.

773
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:11,120
I got the police out
lookin' for you.

774
00:47:11,153 --> 00:47:13,590
Listen, it's late,
and I'm tired, okay?

775
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:17,927
Well, I'm mighty weary waitin'
for that paranoid of yours.

776
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,264
Quick like a bunny now, you bring
him in and sign these papers.

777
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:25,201
He's not here.
You're joshin' me.

778
00:47:25,234 --> 00:47:27,103
I left him in the reading room.

779
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,706
And as for signing papers, you
can stick 'em in your ear!

780
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:33,109
Lookee here now, Mildred. If you
wanna lose your job, you're gonna...

781
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,645
Heinrich, you've got
yourself a deal!

782
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,023
What's the matter?

783
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:02,131
Nothing much.
What are you doing here?

784
00:49:06,202 --> 00:49:10,773
I had an urge to read.
Fascinating book.

785
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:12,241
What's wrong, Holmes?
Are you ill?

786
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:17,646
That is the question.

787
00:49:23,385 --> 00:49:26,455
You're my final friend.
Do you know that?

788
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:29,191
You're the last.
Where's Dr. Watson?

789
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:35,297
- Tell me something offhand.
- She won't leave you.

790
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:42,138
I've spent quite a lot
of time researching.

791
00:49:45,074 --> 00:49:47,777
This is the perfect
place for me.

792
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,412
Who's Who?

793
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:55,417
No, not for me, for him.

794
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,454
I have to be very clear
on that point.

795
00:49:58,487 --> 00:50:01,357
What you need is some breakfast.
Would you like a jelly doughnut?

796
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:03,025
Listen.

797
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,329
Here he is, Playfair, Justin.

798
00:50:07,363 --> 00:50:11,100
Born New York City, 1923.

799
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,469
Harvard College, Harvard Law.

800
00:50:13,502 --> 00:50:15,805
Thesis published, '48.

801
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,275
Married, 1950.

802
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,811
Lucy Clark.

803
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:23,479
Pretty name, Lucy.

804
00:50:26,448 --> 00:50:28,317
Lucy.

805
00:50:30,419 --> 00:50:32,755
Lucy.

806
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,159
Just a name.

807
00:50:37,193 --> 00:50:38,427
Doesn't mean anything.

808
00:50:41,197 --> 00:50:43,432
There are his accomplishments.

809
00:50:43,465 --> 00:50:45,902
Why, he's a happy man.

810
00:50:45,935 --> 00:50:48,304
And proud.

811
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:56,178
For Christ's sake,
which is my life?

812
00:50:56,212 --> 00:50:59,148
I've got some chicken broth.

813
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:03,485
You haven't answered me.
I'll heat it up.

814
00:51:07,824 --> 00:51:10,893
I can't remember childhood.

815
00:51:10,927 --> 00:51:13,896
I have no past.
That's not so bad.

816
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:20,136
There's got to be more
in here than Moriarty.

817
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:27,810
I dreamed it all.
That must be it.

818
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:30,579
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

819
00:51:30,612 --> 00:51:34,483
What's wrong with being Sherlock
Holmes, I'd like to know?

820
00:51:34,516 --> 00:51:36,352
Sometimes I wish to God...

821
00:51:40,156 --> 00:51:41,423
You do?

822
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:51,500
A fop by day,

823
00:51:51,533 --> 00:51:54,503
but after dark,

824
00:51:54,536 --> 00:51:56,438
I ride.

825
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,246
Abuse the meek, will you?

826
00:52:12,554 --> 00:52:14,256
Have that!

827
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,360
Who am I? Ha!

828
00:52:18,394 --> 00:52:20,296
Is he in heaven? Is he in hell?

829
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:23,966
That damned elusive Pimpernel.

830
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,634
What's that?

831
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:29,872
You want to see
the face behind the mask?

832
00:52:29,906 --> 00:52:32,308
This is the face.

833
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:43,552
- I think that's beautiful.
- Thank you.

834
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:45,521
And now I think I'll call up
Dr. Watson.

835
00:52:45,554 --> 00:52:47,323
Please don't do that.
I-I couldn't face her.

836
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:50,359
I've been stuck in the
goddamn subway for an hour!

837
00:52:50,392 --> 00:52:51,928
Justin, thank heaven.

838
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,896
I'm busy. Go away.

839
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:59,435
I couldn't sleep. I've been so worried.
Look at that.

840
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:03,472
They've been searching
for you every place.

841
00:53:06,342 --> 00:53:09,045
Blevins wants your money, and
he's gonna lock you up to get it.

842
00:53:09,078 --> 00:53:10,947
Now, here's my plan.

843
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,215
Do you think I'm Holmes,
or don't you?

844
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:17,319
I'm sorry, but it's the only
point I've got!

845
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:19,989
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll challenge you.

846
00:53:20,022 --> 00:53:22,600
First we'll search for garbage, and
then we'll put the heat on Blevins.

847
00:53:22,624 --> 00:53:25,061
Is that fair enough?
You're patronizing me again.

848
00:53:25,094 --> 00:53:26,695
I'm Watson!

849
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:29,999
I'm here, ready for the chase.

850
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:33,402
Now, come on.
A shopping bag full of garbage.

851
00:53:33,435 --> 00:53:37,506
Think. The city dump.
No, that's much too obvious.

852
00:53:40,642 --> 00:53:42,611
Now, this one said,
"Back to school."

853
00:53:42,644 --> 00:53:44,947
That must be the way
to solve it... schools.

854
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:47,483
How many different kinds
of schools are there?

855
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,953
Library school?
I like you, Doctor.

856
00:53:52,654 --> 00:53:55,724
There's public,
private, parochial...

857
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,728
- Prep.
- Rabbinical.

858
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:01,964
- Charm.
- And schools of fish. Why have you come?

859
00:54:01,998 --> 00:54:03,632
To save your neck.

860
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:06,668
- You care for me?
- I care for all my patients.

861
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,570
Ha. Florence Nightingale.

862
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:10,306
You're damn right.

863
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:12,641
Drama school. And music school.

864
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:15,444
- Grammar.
- High.

865
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:18,314
- Dance.
- Military.

866
00:54:18,347 --> 00:54:20,316
- Cooking.
- Charm.

867
00:54:20,349 --> 00:54:22,751
You said that. I did not!

868
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:26,322
Well, we can't be out of schools.
Let's name some more.

869
00:54:26,355 --> 00:54:29,625
That's it. It's a name.

870
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:31,727
The bag's a name.

871
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,663
Someone named Bag
has got to have a school.

872
00:54:34,696 --> 00:54:36,008
Come on, now.
What kind of a name is Bag?

873
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:38,410
What difference does it make? Wilbur,
quick, a telephone directory.

874
00:54:38,434 --> 00:54:39,634
Right away. I like you, Watson.

875
00:54:39,635 --> 00:54:41,637
You have qualities.
I suppose I do.

876
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:47,009
May I be frank? I'm very glad you're here.
I like you very much.

877
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:49,011
Regular classified.
Ah, good man.

878
00:54:49,045 --> 00:54:51,326
This won't take a minute.
I could use that jelly doughnut.

879
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:55,317
Wilbur, if anybody should ask
you, you haven't seen us.

880
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:57,486
Ah, I've got it!
I was right again!

881
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:00,689
Quick, Watson.
We're gaining on you, Moriarty!

882
00:55:00,722 --> 00:55:02,591
After you.

883
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,698
She came back.

884
00:55:31,087 --> 00:55:33,089
You ready?

885
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,091
Well, what if we get separated?

886
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,459
Yes, we need a rendezvous.

887
00:55:37,493 --> 00:55:39,728
Well, why don't we meet at my apartment?
Good idea.

888
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:41,763
I'll even cook you supper.

889
00:55:48,437 --> 00:55:50,739
Now, try looking academic.

890
00:55:50,772 --> 00:55:53,142
We're two students
come to register.

891
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:18,667
It must be some kind of academy.
Where is it?

892
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,711
Up these stairs. Stay close.

893
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:34,183
Don't lose me.

894
00:56:57,906 --> 00:57:00,642
This door hasn't been used
in 20 years.

895
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:05,447
Make that 30.

896
00:57:05,481 --> 00:57:07,183
Strange.

897
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,487
Maybe our clue is out here.

898
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,856
A pigeon with
a message, possibly.

899
00:57:18,594 --> 00:57:20,796
Don't!

900
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:22,731
We are going to matriculate.

901
00:57:27,836 --> 00:57:30,172
This may be a trap.

902
00:57:30,206 --> 00:57:34,510
Uh, nice sort of school.
Just our kind of place.

903
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:36,212
Keep your pistol ready.

904
00:58:08,244 --> 00:58:11,547
Ah, good afternoon.
Is this the bursar's office?

905
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,215
Who are you?

906
00:58:13,249 --> 00:58:15,884
Holmes and, uh, Watson.

907
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:18,620
Oh.

908
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:21,757
But I thought you were dead.

909
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:24,960
I came back in the sequel.

910
00:58:24,993 --> 00:58:26,795
Oh.

911
00:58:28,664 --> 00:58:31,300
My, is that quincunx
your design?

912
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,702
Yes, it is.

913
00:58:36,004 --> 00:58:39,341
Oh, it's magnificent.
Sir, you're a genius.

914
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,277
Yes, I am.

915
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,679
You're just in time for tea.

916
00:58:43,712 --> 00:58:46,315
We'll meet you by
the basket, my dear.

917
00:58:55,724 --> 00:58:59,295
We haven't put a foot
outside since 1939.

918
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:02,298
We didn't like the look
of things out there.

919
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,800
So, we bought every kind
of vegetable seed.

920
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,003
- Shut down the school.
- Well, we didn't have any pupils, anyway.

921
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:11,940
And ever since,
we've been very happy.

922
00:59:11,973 --> 00:59:15,277
Except for one thing.

923
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,813
Nobody's ever seen our work.

924
00:59:19,715 --> 00:59:22,284
We don't know if it's any good.

925
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,788
But you did recognize
a quincunx when you saw one.

926
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:36,598
Would...
Would you criticize our garden?

927
00:59:36,632 --> 00:59:39,335
- We'd be honored.
- Oh.

928
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,464
And this we call our
bird of paradise.

929
01:00:08,497 --> 01:00:10,298
Mr. Playfair.

930
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:16,805
- Who are you?
- We're friends... of Blevins.

931
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:19,875
- No, you're not.
- We've come to take you for a ride.

932
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,686
You've got a pistol in your pocket.
Keep it there.

933
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,713
Run for the hall and keep going!
Aaah!

934
01:00:31,453 --> 01:00:33,855
Cover me.

935
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:40,829
- Brutes.
- Savages! Savages!

936
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:42,798
Murderer!

937
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:05,086
Whatever you are, don't burn!

938
01:01:17,899 --> 01:01:20,135
Melt, damn you.

939
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,181
It's foggy and damp
here in New York.

940
01:01:24,205 --> 01:01:26,408
The temperature at Central Park
is 45 degrees.

941
01:01:26,442 --> 01:01:28,444
Humidity, 84%.

942
01:01:32,047 --> 01:01:34,127
Winds out of the east at a
brisk 10 miles per hour...

943
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:36,117
gusting up to 15.

944
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,954
Oh, God.

945
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,198
Tonight's forecast calls for
rapidly dropping temperatures,

946
01:01:41,222 --> 01:01:43,825
heavy fog and a chance
for some more light showers.

947
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:46,027
Oh, thank God.

948
01:02:13,822 --> 01:02:15,491
Some women do this every day.

949
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:28,537
Oh, I'm not dressed.

950
01:03:25,026 --> 01:03:28,864
They never think to
watch the fire escape.

951
01:03:37,305 --> 01:03:39,107
What's the matter?

952
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:42,544
Nothing is the matter, and
don't look at me, please.

953
01:03:42,578 --> 01:03:45,547
You don't look
any worse than usual.

954
01:03:45,581 --> 01:03:47,048
Would you just go away?

955
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:01,697
They're lovely.

956
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:03,331
I wish they were.

957
01:04:03,364 --> 01:04:07,335
It's been some time since
anyone bought me flowers.

958
01:04:10,271 --> 01:04:12,240
Uh, new dress?

959
01:04:16,745 --> 01:04:20,115
Olive oil, hmm. Very chic.

960
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:25,253
Oh, yes, uh... Uh, dinner's cold.

961
01:04:25,286 --> 01:04:29,124
Sorry I'm so late. Oh, no,
it hasn't warmed up yet.

962
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:32,027
I'd have been here sooner, but
the clue was most complex.

963
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,896
I have worked out where we're
meeting him, though it wasn't easy.

964
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,898
Where is the bar?

965
01:04:36,932 --> 01:04:40,168
Oh, it's in the oven. Oh...

966
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:42,370
Oh, I'm sorry.

967
01:04:42,403 --> 01:04:45,741
I have to use the oven for storage
'cause it's such a small apartment.

968
01:04:45,774 --> 01:04:47,175
Very sensible.

969
01:04:48,744 --> 01:04:51,146
Uh, we're just going
to have a simple supper.

970
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:54,015
Plain home cooking.

971
01:04:54,049 --> 01:04:58,019
- Yes, I see.
- That's right. Go ahead and make fun of it.

972
01:04:58,053 --> 01:05:00,622
That insecurity of yours.

973
01:05:00,656 --> 01:05:02,357
I know.

974
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:07,062
I like your house.

975
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:13,935
It's nice. It's just like you.

976
01:05:13,969 --> 01:05:16,738
You know, somehow that just
misses being flattery.

977
01:05:18,073 --> 01:05:20,108
I haven't got a vase.

978
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:23,244
I think the beans are burning.

979
01:05:25,013 --> 01:05:26,982
Oh, no. That... That's soup.

980
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:30,686
Well, are the drinks ready?
After you.

981
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,195
Oh, here.

982
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,130
Oh, thank you.

983
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,678
Well, here we are.

984
01:05:58,847 --> 01:06:01,249
We're having wine with dinner.

985
01:06:01,282 --> 01:06:03,151
Ah, very civilized.

986
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:09,290
Ice on crystal.
Good sound, isn't it?

987
01:06:09,324 --> 01:06:12,293
Well, it's not crystal. Oh.

988
01:06:12,327 --> 01:06:14,162
Your-Your good health.

989
01:06:22,871 --> 01:06:27,008
You know, I... I really should
have taken you out to dinner.

990
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:28,710
Oh, no. It's good
for me to cook.

991
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,715
Well, when this case is over,

992
01:06:33,749 --> 01:06:36,718
we'll have plenty of time for
going out to the theater...

993
01:06:36,752 --> 01:06:38,395
and fashionable places and
all that sort of thing.

994
01:06:38,419 --> 01:06:41,122
I was thinking earlier,

995
01:06:44,525 --> 01:06:47,162
a little recreation.

996
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:57,172
Why don't we set
a date right now?

997
01:06:57,205 --> 01:07:00,308
Would you be free
tomorrow night?

998
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:10,518
Actually those fashionable
places can be very tedious,

999
01:07:10,551 --> 01:07:12,754
and I might embarrass you.

1000
01:07:12,788 --> 01:07:18,760
I-I don't think I would,
uh, fit in.

1001
01:07:18,794 --> 01:07:21,462
There's no denying that.

1002
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:25,500
Of course I have an awful lot of costumes.
I could change.

1003
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:31,506
It's a foolish notion, even so.

1004
01:07:31,539 --> 01:07:33,441
No-No offense.

1005
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,145
Tomorrow?

1006
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,351
Do you mean tomorrow night?

1007
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:53,528
Do you dance? Uh, well, I
haven't in years. Uh, do you?

1008
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:56,197
I don't know. I can't remember.

1009
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:58,399
Let's find out. No, let's not.

1010
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:01,202
I'd really rather not. Come on.

1011
01:08:01,236 --> 01:08:03,138
I-I'd only stumble.

1012
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:05,206
Nobody's watching.

1013
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,810
**

1014
01:08:08,844 --> 01:08:10,511
Come on. Don't be scared. Uh...

1015
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,513
**

1016
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:19,855
You're doing fine.

1017
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,323
Well, I'm a natural athlete.

1018
01:08:22,357 --> 01:08:24,325
Oh, I beg your pardon. Oh.

1019
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:27,328
Well, maybe we both need
a little more practice.

1020
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:30,598
Just think of all the dancing
we can do once this is over.

1021
01:08:30,631 --> 01:08:33,401
Do you play checkers?
I'm a whiz.

1022
01:08:33,434 --> 01:08:36,437
Ah. There's so many things
you need two people for.

1023
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:38,206
I'll teach you billiards too.

1024
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:41,442
We'll, uh,
sip our port and read aloud.

1025
01:08:51,019 --> 01:08:53,188
I'm here. I'm right beside you.

1026
01:08:53,221 --> 01:08:55,390
Oh, please. Can you hear me?

1027
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,926
Oh, dear God.

1028
01:09:00,295 --> 01:09:03,264
You can't do this to me.

1029
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:06,968
Holmes!
Oh, my Holmes, you can't die!

1030
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,406
You're some doctor.

1031
01:09:15,911 --> 01:09:19,547
Get off my chest.
I'm having trouble breathing.

1032
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:22,951
Oh, I'm sor... You're alive!

1033
01:09:24,052 --> 01:09:26,287
You called me Holmes.

1034
01:09:26,321 --> 01:09:29,257
- I did?
- You don't look so good.

1035
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,426
I'll get my bag.

1036
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:34,195
I tell you, Watson,

1037
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:36,531
I expected better of him.

1038
01:09:36,564 --> 01:09:39,500
It's beneath the Moriarty
I've always known.

1039
01:09:39,534 --> 01:09:41,502
You ought to be in bed.

1040
01:09:41,536 --> 01:09:43,604
Don't worry, Watson.
Tip-top shape.

1041
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,573
No, no, no, no.
Let me look at you.

1042
01:09:45,606 --> 01:09:47,575
No time for that.
We've got to mobilize.

1043
01:09:47,608 --> 01:09:50,445
We're staying right here.
It isn't safe here.

1044
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:53,448
But at our rendezvous at
midnight, I'll be ready.

1045
01:09:54,715 --> 01:09:56,985
Someone's going to die tonight.

1046
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:59,320
It might be me.

1047
01:09:59,354 --> 01:10:03,324
Oh, Watson, no one's as black
as he or half as quick.

1048
01:10:03,358 --> 01:10:04,960
He is perfection.

1049
01:10:04,993 --> 01:10:07,228
You can tell a lot about
a man by his enemies.

1050
01:10:07,262 --> 01:10:09,230
I'm proud he wants me dead.

1051
01:10:09,264 --> 01:10:11,466
Hold still.

1052
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,336
We've got so much to do.

1053
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,476
Hershey Kisses.

1054
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,378
Out the back.

1055
01:10:33,388 --> 01:10:36,257
Wilbur. Wilbur!

1056
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:40,628
Holmes, you startled me.

1057
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:43,999
I've solved it all.
Here is where he will be.

1058
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:45,967
What's that you got?

1059
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:48,069
It was a white plume once.

1060
01:10:48,103 --> 01:10:51,272
We're meeting Moriarty at midnight.
Will you wear it?

1061
01:11:22,337 --> 01:11:23,538
What's up?

1062
01:11:24,772 --> 01:11:26,741
I'm helping
one poor nut escape...

1063
01:11:26,774 --> 01:11:28,643
if it's the last
damn thing I do.

1064
01:11:28,676 --> 01:11:30,011
I want you.

1065
01:11:31,446 --> 01:11:36,384
Is there romance,
excitement, danger?

1066
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:38,586
All in glorious Technicolor.

1067
01:11:44,559 --> 01:11:46,703
Your house is right around the corner.
They'll be watching.

1068
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:48,063
Back.

1069
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:51,766
Daisy! Oh, it's you.

1070
01:11:51,799 --> 01:11:53,701
Guess what. I'm leaving Blevins.

1071
01:11:53,734 --> 01:11:57,038
I'm glad to hear it. I married him for
love, but I don't love him anymore.

1072
01:11:58,639 --> 01:12:01,176
Hot dog!

1073
01:12:01,209 --> 01:12:03,511
You miserable...

1074
01:12:15,523 --> 01:12:17,024
Maud!

1075
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:20,461
Why, Mr. Holmes.

1076
01:12:20,495 --> 01:12:22,530
What's the matter?

1077
01:12:22,563 --> 01:12:25,133
There are no more westerns.

1078
01:15:33,854 --> 01:15:36,657
Dear friends,

1079
01:15:36,691 --> 01:15:41,962
will those of you who know what this
is all about please raise your hands.

1080
01:15:53,073 --> 01:15:56,777
I think...

1081
01:15:56,811 --> 01:15:59,013
if God is dead,

1082
01:16:00,981 --> 01:16:03,718
he laughed himself to death.

1083
01:16:03,751 --> 01:16:07,755
Because, you see,
we live in Eden.

1084
01:16:07,788 --> 01:16:09,290
Genesis has got it all wrong.

1085
01:16:09,324 --> 01:16:12,693
We've never left the garden.

1086
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:14,695
Look about you.

1087
01:16:22,837 --> 01:16:26,874
It's hard to find,
I grant you, but it is here.

1088
01:16:26,907 --> 01:16:29,310
Under our feet.

1089
01:16:29,344 --> 01:16:33,814
Beneath the surface. All around
us is everything we want.

1090
01:16:33,848 --> 01:16:39,954
The earth is shining
under the soot.

1091
01:16:39,987 --> 01:16:43,958
We're all fools.

1092
01:16:47,662 --> 01:16:51,031
But together,
you and I, tonight,

1093
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:55,002
we'll bring him... down.

1094
01:17:24,064 --> 01:17:27,334
Nobody came.
I don't much blame them.

1095
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:41,048
Turn it backwards,
and you'll see the sense.

1096
01:17:41,081 --> 01:17:43,117
Suppose we took
the shopping bag.

1097
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:45,953
What kind of garden
would we take it to?

1098
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,798
Wow.

1099
01:17:57,832 --> 01:18:00,768
We're here.

1100
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,136
What happens now?

1101
01:18:02,169 --> 01:18:05,406
We'll wait.

1102
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,176
Well, I'm not afraid
if you're not.

1103
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:12,813
It's starting.

1104
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:15,416
He's out there, somewhere.

1105
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,184
Crouching, steady, cold.

1106
01:18:17,217 --> 01:18:20,888
He never sweats, you know.

1107
01:18:20,921 --> 01:18:26,026
Is pride a sin, Holmes?
Because I'm proud of you.

1108
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,429
Control yourself.

1109
01:18:28,463 --> 01:18:33,133
Cross your fingers.

1110
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:37,738
That makes nine.

1111
01:18:37,772 --> 01:18:39,106
I love you.

1112
01:18:47,147 --> 01:18:48,983
This week only,

1113
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:52,987
loin of pork,
79 cents per pound.

1114
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:59,860
Delicious, tender sirloin
steaks, 89 cents a pound.

1115
01:18:59,894 --> 01:19:05,032
Lean boiled ham,
99 cents a pound.

1116
01:19:05,065 --> 01:19:08,135
Fresh frying chickens,

1117
01:19:08,168 --> 01:19:11,138
29 cents a pound.

1118
01:19:11,171 --> 01:19:16,577
Fresh ground beef,
49 cents a pound.

1119
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,813
Delicious, tender...

1120
01:19:18,846 --> 01:19:21,549
sirloin steaks...

1121
01:19:21,582 --> 01:19:24,919
at 89 cents per pound.

1122
01:19:34,629 --> 01:19:36,897
God.

1123
01:19:36,931 --> 01:19:40,935
Moriarty? I'm here.

1124
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,239
I mean, in budapest,
I think I saw mostly.

1125
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,775
The inside of the concert hall
and the marriott.

1126
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,012
But, you know,
I shouldn't complain.

1127
01:20:02,022 --> 01:20:06,093
I'm patient. I can wait.

1128
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,203
I've misread the clue.

1129
01:20:16,236 --> 01:20:17,672
But if twenty grand
was a number,

1130
01:20:17,705 --> 01:20:20,207
then the clue might be...

1131
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:22,543
The number on the door at Dr.
Bagg's. What was it?

1132
01:20:22,577 --> 01:20:25,045
Sixty-seven. Right, but 67 what?

1133
01:20:27,114 --> 01:20:29,950
What else was twenty grand?

1134
01:20:29,984 --> 01:20:33,120
A horse. A racehorse!

1135
01:20:33,153 --> 01:20:35,556
Watson, you're a genius.

1136
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:41,128
Well, add it up.
A horse, a school and 67.

1137
01:20:41,161 --> 01:20:43,898
It's a riding school
at 67th street!

1138
01:20:43,931 --> 01:20:45,566
God, there is one.
Just off Central Park.

1139
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:51,606
It's all done now. You are a detective.
Here we go.

1140
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,260
You put her in a big bowl,
at least a gallon.

1141
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:30,830
Get a good bubbler,
maybe a plecostomus.

1142
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,732
And don't feed her too much.

1143
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,161
I'm ready.

1144
01:21:17,064 --> 01:21:20,567
Do you really mean to walk with me?
I do.

1145
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,293
He believes jimmy transposed
the address numbers.

1146
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:42,462
Transposed the numbers?

1147
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:45,198
How would he even do that?

1148
01:21:22,737 --> 01:21:26,240
We may have to walk near
dangers, close to awful things.

1149
01:21:26,273 --> 01:21:28,242
I know that.

1150
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,904
If there's one thing
I cannot abide,

1151
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,073
It's a man who won't
own up to his mistakes.

1152
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:31,578
Now, whatever mud mcgill
is slinging he's not gonna.

1153
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:36,583
Screw me out of the best
outside counsel I've ever had.

1154
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,382
They blot the sun out
for miles around.

1155
01:21:35,415 --> 01:21:37,317
I may not always win.

1156
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:39,987
Does justice ever lose?

1157
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,590
It does, from time to time.

1158
01:21:49,229 --> 01:21:51,699
We'll meet him here.

1159
01:21:58,172 --> 01:21:59,674
Get down.

1160
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:07,682
Somewhere...

1161
01:22:11,786 --> 01:22:16,056
I'm not afraid,
because you're with me.

1162
01:22:22,797 --> 01:22:25,299
I can't remember how
I lived before you came.

1163
01:22:25,332 --> 01:22:27,334
Oh, Holmes, I love you.

1164
01:22:31,806 --> 01:22:33,240
Listen.

1165
01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:36,343
What?

1166
01:22:37,712 --> 01:22:41,348
It's him. It's Moriarty.

1167
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:49,389
There's nothing.

1168
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:55,763
Now. He's coming.

1169
01:22:55,796 --> 01:22:58,733
On horseback,
riding like a king.

1170
01:23:00,034 --> 01:23:02,169
I can't hear.

1171
01:23:02,837 --> 01:23:04,238
Not on my knees.

1172
01:23:06,373 --> 01:23:10,010
There's nothing.
There's nothing!

1173
01:23:10,044 --> 01:23:11,278
On your feet by me.

1174
01:23:13,147 --> 01:23:15,315
A sound, please.
Just a little sound.

1175
01:23:15,349 --> 01:23:17,184
Stand up.

1176
01:23:17,217 --> 01:23:19,053
Holmes, he's not there.

1177
01:23:19,086 --> 01:23:21,155
There isn't any Moriarty,
it's just...

1178
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:25,760
You hear it?

1179
01:23:32,232 --> 01:23:34,401
They're nearer.

1180
01:23:34,434 --> 01:23:36,136
Nearer.

1181
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:40,741
Ah, now, there. Do you see him now?
Not yet.

1182
01:23:42,877 --> 01:23:45,112
Yes.

1183
00:24:58,216 --> 00:25:00,016
And he wanted to help.

1184
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,952
That's sanctimonious.

1185
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,787
He's everything you said he was.

1186
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,089
He makes you proud.

1187
01:23:55,122 --> 01:23:57,758
He does.

1188
01:23:57,792 --> 01:24:01,328
Stand closer to me.
Hold my hand.

1189
01:24:03,864 --> 01:24:06,433
And now we're together. Yes.

1190
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,179
<i>Jimmy.</i>

1191
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:40,450
<i>You do realize
you just confessed to a felony?</i>

1192
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:42,618
<i>I guess.</i>

1193
01:24:08,468 --> 01:24:13,107
Let it be said he found us
very close together...

01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,075
in the light.
