1
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,733
Agreed then; 
for whoever comes or calls,

2
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,033
tomorrow I'm gonna 
leave for Paris.

3
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,389
Send a bunch of roses to 
Madam Jordaine on my behalf.

4
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,599
The Duke of Fadda and
the Prince of Sebasto.

5
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,838
Allow me, dear Fabio
to introduce 

6
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,638
the great officer Ferrani, 
the Prince of Sebasto.

7
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,599
What do you decide, sir?

8
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,033
Countess of Parma.

9
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,432
- Reine-Claude.
- Countess of Parma, Reine-Claude.

10
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,308
Countess of Parma, Reine-Claude.

11
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,711
Countess of Parma, Reine-Claude!

12
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,356
Countess of Parma, Reine-Claude.

13
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,474
The Duke of Fadda,
the Prince of Sebasto.

14
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,115
- That one in the box nearby.
- He is the Duke of Fadda.

15
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,239
- The other one is 
the Prince of Sebasto.

16
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,639
- Who are the women? 
That one on the left!

17
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,038
What Milan! Let the lady know
that I  leave for Paris at 17:05.

18
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,773
Allow me to say 
that according to the telegram

19
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,273
it seems that widow Marta Rossi...

20
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,638
has bought all the shares
- All the shares? For my company?

21
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,829
But I've got three of them!

22
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,829
Except those three, 
she bought the other 997.

23
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,234
So what? Just because she's
the owner? But I'm the brain!

24
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,550
Nonsense! 
I'm leaving for Paris!

25
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,636
Very well. I'll send you
a telegram from Paris, 

26
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,636
let the agency know that.

27
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,235
All done sir.

28
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,939
Today at Mirafiori
the climax of the season. 

29
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,439
It'll be very smart.

30
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,558
What do you decide, sir?

31
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,471
- Ardour, Prestige
- Ardour and Prestige?

32
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,553
Ardour and Prestige.

33
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,639
Ardour, Prestige
Do you like these names?

34
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,035
- Did you give them yourself? - Yes.
- They're appropriate, but...

35
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,239
- Better the old fashion names.
- Yes, Countess of Parma...

36
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,951
No! Countess of Parma!

37
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,236
The names of these suits 
are better!

38
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,554
- Ardour! Prestige!
- That's it! - Ok!

39
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,794
- Let's go!
- Sir, may I have a word with you?

40
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,631
- Right now, in here?
- But sir, you're about to leave!

41
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,635
All right then, 
100 lire all together.

42
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,635
Don't be like that sir,
100 yesterday and 100 today.

43
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,031
100 lire all for 
the evening and tailcoats.

44
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,877
It doesn't matter,
don't be a petty bourgeois!

45
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,877
150 deal!

46
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,237
- The Prince?
- He brought me a Russian Prince...

47
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,396
- He's Russian, but he's a Prince.
- 50 lire more for the Russian.

48
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,835
- All right, Duke?
- Sure.

49
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,635
Let's see...

50
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,836
Well, let's go.

51
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,635
Ok then, 
today the introductions.

52
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,838
The Prince with Adriana 
at Lambergo tea meeting.

53
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,153
The Duke with 
Marcella at Mirafiori.

54
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,153
Remember, 
I don't want people thinking...

55
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,359
'She's a model 
at Maison Printemps.'

56
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,232
You may say: 
'My wife, do you like her?

57
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,232
She dresses 
at Maison Printemps'

58
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,272
Are you joking? 
Either you're joking or...

59
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,272
Am I supposed to say: 
'My wife, do you like her?'

60
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,035
Say then: 
'My sister, do you like her?'

61
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,229
- He's kidding, he's kidding!
- Then say: 'This is my friend.'

62
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,438
- Make sure they understand.
- They won't let anyone understand.

63
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,130
That's right. 
We are not "friends" of anybody.

64
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,630
Make your mind up, 
let's go now.

65
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,958
- Cigarette, babe? 
- No, thanks.

66
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,958
You don't want me calling you babe?
Shall I call you Marcella?

67
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,671
- Or Countess of Parma?
- How long before arriving to Mirafiori?

68
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,435
You look nervous, have you
argued with your boyfriend?

69
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,514
- What boyfriend?
- Don't you have a boyfriend?

70
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,716
What a cutie!

71
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,714
I won't spoil you!
Does the dress make you dizzy?

72
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,270
You can try to fool someone 
else with these things.

73
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,638
- For me you're just a model
- And who do you think you are?

74
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,395
You're a model just like me
Got a title? I see how you use it!

75
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,634
How dare you talking to me 
like that, little braggart. 

76
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,634
You'll pay 
for your words dearly.

77
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,839
Put it on the chief's bill 
You'll strike a bargain!

78
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,709
I won't drop at your level.

79
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,709
For god's sake, 
don't bother, stay higher!

80
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,039
Don't try following me, 
I don't know you.

81
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,512
And if you see the boss, 
tell him...  actually, 

82
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,512
I will speak with the boss, 
understand?

83
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,716
Go away!

84
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:35,117
- What sort of people!
May I go to smoke? - Yes, go on.

85
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,036
- Will you let me know 
when you finish? - What?

86
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,431
- What are  you trying to do?
- Nothing. I'm trying to reverse.

87
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,832
- Do you think is that the way
to do it? - Do me a favour!

88
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,837
Don't be like that.
Haven't I got the right to try

89
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,837
the car as I wish? 
- Ah, is that so?

90
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,435
Give me 
your driving license.

91
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,958
Here it is, 
but it'll cost you dearly.

92
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,113
- Don't worry about it. Your name?
- Gino Vanni, born in Udine...

93
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,591
- One moment. Are you Vanni?
- Can't you read?

94
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,638
Thing is with that hat on 
I couldn't recognize you.

95
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,638
I do beg your pardon.

96
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,997
- It doesn't matter.
- A striker like you!

97
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,873
How could I not recognize you?

98
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,873
I remember that action 
two Sundays ago towards the end.

99
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,432
I suffered about that missed goal, 
I wasn't able to eat my dinner.

100
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,255
Even my wife was saying 
'Why don't you eat?' 

101
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,755
- What can you do? It's the feeling!
- Never mind. We'll do better next time

102
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,039
Come to the stadium and ask about me,
I'll let you in next time.

103
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,271
- Thanks, will do. Eleven and ten.
- What?

104
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,671
Try to understand. 
I've got to do my duty!

105
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,638
An eleven and 
ten fine you said?

106
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,638
Not sure but 
I may have some small change.

107
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,237
- Here ten lire, did you say eleven?
- Eleven and ten.

108
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,109
- Here one lira...
- Don't worry.

109
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,796
No, I must have money. 
Wait.

110
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,951
Here one coin...

111
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,351
- It doesn't matter really! 
- No, wait.

112
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,434
- I have a stamp.
- Thanks and sorry about that.

113
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,996
After all they're good people, he
probably didn't want to make me pay.

114
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,030
But then he issued 
the ticket already.

115
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,434
I never pay fines thanks to 
my popularity.

116
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,231
You're not a fan, aren't you? 
Pity!

117
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,913
How can one not 
get excited for a sport.

118
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,713
so dynamic and healthy 
like football?

119
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,353
I'm sorry, maybe you're waiting
for someone. I'll go away. 

120
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,353
Will I see you at the races?

121
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,591
Yes? No? I hope so!

122
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,950
Well? I say miss, 
what are you doing here?

123
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,159
During the day you don't train,
at night you go dancing, theaters...

124
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,428
- Who knows what you do at night!
- I dream. - Dreams!

125
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,630
- I dream of you 
in small pants scoring a goal!

126
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,630
If I had a few kilos 
less I'd show you!

127
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,237
- When I was a winger...
- They could tackle you no bother!

128
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,837
- In the game against Florence...
- Marco, stop bothering me!

129
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,437
- Actually, give me 500 lire. - What?
- I'll give them back tomorrow.

130
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,240
- Tomorrow!
- Yes, my aunt is coming.

131
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,432
It's 6 years you've been 
talking about this aunt; 

132
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,032
we all know she doesn't exist.

133
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,829
Doesn't she? Look at the envelope!
Sender, Marta Rossi. She's loaded!

134
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,231
She's rich and she loves me, don't 
be stingy and lend me the money.

135
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,232
I can give you 100 lire only.

136
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,632
- They're not enough! 
- Do you want them?

137
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,438
Don't show it 
to everybody like that!

138
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,035
I've paid you 75 lire to take 
the Miss to the races 

139
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,435
and not to leave 
her in the car park!

140
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,639
Do you call her "Miss"?
Dear sir the Duke of Fadda...

141
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,938
The Duke of Fadda 
grabbed 75 lire to take her.

142
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,638
75 lire. Do you want me 
to give them back?

143
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,838
- Yes
- Well, let's not overact.

144
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,753
Ok, I'll do it for you. 
Where's the girl?

145
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,753
There she is.

146
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,354
- Dear Countess!
- Dear Duke!

147
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,878
I wouldn't have gave up 
the pleasure of meeting you. 

148
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,878
You're so kind Countess!

149
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,438
- Do you play?
- No. - I do. May I?

150
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,238
Sure!

151
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,636
Countess, I beg your 
pardon for the nonsense.

152
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,636
I said earlier; 
I was confused.

153
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,836
You see, I didn't know...

154
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,555
One moment, Grivola is favorite,
I'm going to the totalizator.

155
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,829
Grivola can't win 
for goodness sake!

156
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,612
Are they giving Leda at 20?

157
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,312
What an effort! 
They could give her even at 100.

158
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,837
She's old, lame and 
with a whooping cough.

159
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,237
She couldn't win 
even if she races alone.

160
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,990
- Hundred on Leda winning.
- Leda, 2000 against 100.

161
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,874
Hundred on Leda 
for me as well.

162
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,436
- Did you take it for 20?
- 2000 lire for sure.

163
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,229
- If you want I'll give 
it for 1000. - I... 500

164
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,436
- 1000!
- 500.

165
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,636
All right, spit it out!

166
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,839
That's where you 
hide the money!

167
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,839
They belong to the ironer... 
belonged!

168
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,140
- Hello, Jack. 
- Did you play Grivola?

169
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,840
- Grivola? 
No, I played Leda!

170
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,430
Leda failed to start!

171
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,636
That's when 
you bet on a bastard!

172
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,109
One plays for fun, 
after all.

173
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,634
Damn!

174
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,429
They said it was the favorite.

175
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,429
Yeah, right. 
Favorite to come last sure!

176
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,118
It's Leda!

177
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,670
Leda! Leda!

178
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,277
C'mon babe! A bit more!

179
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,034
Yes! Leda!

180
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,838
Darling, dear!

181
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,829
Leda has won!

182
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,834
- So, I won 2000 lire then!
- Yes.

183
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,231
- But, you won them as well!
- Of course I won as well.

184
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,238
- God, so many people at the counter.
- If you wish, I'll go for you.

185
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,278
- Actually...
- Don't you trust me?

186
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,476
Yes, but...

187
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,197
- Well, you've got to collect as well.
- That's right. I've got to!

188
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,793
Thanks.

189
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,231
- Miss, what are you doing here?
- I'm waiting for... the Duke.

190
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,314
- Here he comes!
- Dear Miss, you always disappear!

191
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,037
It's 16:30! I've got to go
to the railway station.

192
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,956
I'm taking the car, 
you'll get a taxi. Let's go!

193
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,513
- Leda, 2000 against 100.
- 1000, 1500, 2000, 2100.

194
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,830
- What are we looking for?
- 2000 lire - What?

195
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,994
I thought 
he was a gentleman.

196
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,834
But dear, nobody is that
in front of 2000 lire.

197
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,358
- He'd be far away by now.
- Let's see. There is his car!

198
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,035
Was that him? Oh dear, 

199
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,035
how could you trust 
a stranger with 2000 lire?

200
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,795
- Did you know him? - No.
- Can you trace him? - No.

201
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,932
- What does this idiot 
want with his horning?

202
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,832
The usual one 
who wants his way.

203
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,719
Speed up, c'mon!

204
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,599
- I'm sorry, what about that lady?
- Who?

205
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,355
- Before there was a lady in here.
- Before, but not now.

206
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,312
- Where is she? 
- I don't know.

207
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,912
I've got to pass 
an important message.

208
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,598
- No message, I don't...
- No, a letter.

209
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,354
All right then.

210
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,229
Sir, your compartment
in the centre is ready.

211
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,837
- Are the suitcases all right?
- Yes, but there's a problem.

212
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,629
The widow Rossi called,
she's coming tomorrow.

213
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,032
- You told her...
- That you booked the train for Paris.

214
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,877
- What did she say?
- She gave me this message.

215
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,977
"If you leave for Paris, 
you can stay there!"

216
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,509
Tell the lady that I am in Paris
and that she stops teasing me or...

217
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,992
- I could just give my notice!
- But... - Enough.

218
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,509
- All on board! - Actually, 
I've got an idea. Porter!

219
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,236
- Good morning Sir!
- Good morning.

220
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,752
Now you'll see! 
Today we'll have fun.

221
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,152
What time does 
the widow Rossi arrive?

222
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,356
During the day, 
she didn't mention the time.

223
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,435
Whatever time she comes, 
remember to say...

224
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,859
that the director 
is not around, 

225
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,359
he's gone for a stroll, 
just like that!

226
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,640
C'mon then!

227
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,635
What's this?
The new Jordaine's models!

228
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,077
- Those parcels arrived this morning.
- Yes, but...

229
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,440
I want to breath Paris's air,
let them put on straight away.

230
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,638
- But...
- No excuses!

231
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,830
I keep on managing this company and
choose my own designs in Paris.

232
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,229
Sir, the models from Milan
sent by Mrs. Rossi...

233
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,439
What a bore, what a trouble!
Milan!

234
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,990
Look at that! Paris!

235
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,198
I'm looking, 
but you won't let me speak sir!

236
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,037
- These are the models from Milan.
- Has Mrs. Rossi sent them?

237
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,115
- Yes.
- Aren't they Jordaine's models!

238
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,035
So they are the models from Milan!
I thought there was something fishy.

239
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,639
Would that be 
a casual lounge-suit?

240
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,431
- 2000 lire of cloth waisted.
- It costs 2300 lire.

241
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,151
Miss, have you heard?
The rug you're wearing...

242
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,394
..costs 2300 lire so, careful 
when you take it off. Don't ruin it.

243
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,670
Make sure not 
to show them to customers,

244
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,670
and if I see them again 
I'll fire you.

245
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,040
- What's wrong with him?
- The new boss is coming.

246
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,354
- Does it look so bad?
- No - It's lovely.

247
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,558
'You look divine
in that dress, countess.'

248
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,634
I let myself being fooled.

249
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,237
Beside he was a bore and persisting!
I don't want to think about it.

250
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,156
- Not even about the 2000 lire?
- No, I want that!

251
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,358
Who is it?

252
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,558
- C'mon, don't worry!
- It's too much, go away!

253
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,758
Is Miss Marcella here?

254
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,231
An urgent message 
for you, Countess!

255
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,630
Go away!

256
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,111
- I knew he wasn't the type...
- Who is it?

257
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,432
No!

258
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:31,233
'Countess, you disappeared 
like a sweet dream'. - My god!

259
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,439
'The pain of not seeing you
and a debt of 2000 lire.'

260
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,036
- You were right then.
- I knew it!

261
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,236
'Please do call me 
tomorrow at the stadium.'

262
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,836
Vanni!

263
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,953
Vanni! Phone!

264
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,756
Thanks!

265
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,993
- Hello?
- This is Count Buzzicanti

266
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,470
No! Two installments, two!

267
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,438
What? Waiting more?

268
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:21,310
Yesterday I waited almost two
hours in front the stadium.

269
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,792
I'm waiting since three months,
what do you think I should do?

270
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,034
Do as you like, you are free
to use the means you want.

271
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,670
Stop it now, 
you understand?

272
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,359
Hello!

273
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,518
I beg your pardon, are you
looking for Mr Vanni? Sure!

274
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,718
Call Mr Vanni down the pitch!

275
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,909
Receptionist, put the call through
to Mr Vanni's private cabin.

276
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,230
- One moment, he's coming soon.
- He's coming soon.

277
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,953
Oh boy, they threw in turmoil
half stadium, 

278
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,553
they treat them very well!

279
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,037
Hallo, is that Mr Vanni?

280
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,829
Wait, the countess would
like a word with you.

281
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,433
You shouldn't 
have called me 'Countess'.

282
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,633
Done! Be indifferent 
about the 2000 lire.

283
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,037
Hallo? Yes, it's me.

284
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,239
I'm so sorry but yesterday
when we left each other...

285
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,031
I and the Duke received
an invitation we couldn't refuse.

286
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,035
The 2000 lire? No rush for 
such a thing at all.

287
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,350
Send them to me.

288
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,592
Oh no, I can't give the name!

289
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,836
You are right.

290
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,599
I don't know then.

291
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,992
- An appointment?
- You play hard to get.

292
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,437
I don't know, I don't go out
often and I've got a few commitments.

293
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,832
- Good.
- At my home? It's not possible!

294
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,671
No, on the street
it would be risky.

295
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,708
In a coffee shop 
is not nice.

296
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,396
Give him the appointment now,
poor thing.

297
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,634
Almost every morning,
at midday, I pass by...

298
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,236
- Without commitment though.
- Two minutes only.

299
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,678
Just the time to sort my debt out
and give you my best regards.

300
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,476
Marco!

301
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,637
- Marco, my dear, in an hour!
- What?

302
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,235
An appointment, 
at midday under the arcades.

303
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,239
Well, it wasn't 
actually an appointment,

304
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,439
she's a lady, you know.

305
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,834
She said that almost every morning
she walks down the arcades.

306
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,631
- What do you do?
- At midday I'll be there.

307
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,236
'Oh, Countess, what a coincidence!'
Come on.

308
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,040
And what about aunty?

309
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,159
I forgot about her,
she had to come right today!

310
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,475
Call the countess and say blah blah
and move the appointment.

311
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,397
I can't! I don't know where
she lives, where do I call her?

312
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,475
- Do me a favour... - No money.
- I don't need money!

313
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,998
- You go and pick aunty up.
- You're crazy!

314
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:45,437
- How do I recognize her?
- It won't be difficult

315
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,355
She's old with glasses, shrewish 
and strut. You can't miss her.

316
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,034
- Mr Vanni will you give me 
an autograph? - Sure.

317
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,638
- Stop playing the diva. - Poor boy,
he just want an autograph - Good!

318
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,552
Me too!

319
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,038
So young and so wretched! 
Pretending to be a star!

320
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,308
You're jealous, when you played
no-one was asking you an autograph.

321
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,712
- Mr. Vanni?
- One more autograph!

322
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,229
- Hurry up.
- A signature here.

323
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,435
- Done - One moment, 
this is the judicial attachment.

324
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,359
I'm a bailiff, I'm gonna
take your car away...

325
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,036
... on a legal request from
Mr Buzzicanti.

326
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,637
- Unless you want to pay the 1.850 lire!
- I don't have time now.

327
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,839
- We can talk about it tomorrow.
- I've got to do the seizing today.

328
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,835
- All right, come back tonight.
- The car won't move from here.

329
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,594
- Either pay or...
- I'll pay!

330
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,798
- All right.
- See you tonight.

331
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,717
If you want to use the car,
you've got to pay now.

332
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,033
- And I'm doing you a favour because...
- I understand! How much is it?

333
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,592
- 1.850 lire and 75 cents.
- Here.

334
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,032
I think he won't give you
the 2.000 lire straight away.

335
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,159
- He was on a hurry over the phone.
- He'll take you for a ride - Oh, no!

336
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,393
- You used the Countess' money.
- What could I do?

337
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,029
- Shame!
- What?

338
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,239
I would have liked
this story ending happily.

339
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,838
- What's the problem?
- Where do I find a smart dress?

340
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,436
It's true. 
I've got an idea!

341
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,036
The boss doesn't want
the models from Milan.

342
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,238
- Take this!
- Magnific!

343
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,032
Actually, I hope she won't come.
She said "almost every day".

344
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,239
- Maybe today she won't pass by.
- What if she will?

345
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,436
If she will... amen!

346
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,030
Oh Countess, finally! 

347
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,230
I thought I couldn't 
come this morning.

348
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,916
- But at the last moment...
- That's how luck strikes.

349
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,093
You're right. 
Like yesterday with Leda.

350
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,393
It's true! Then...

351
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,234
- You're exaggerating 
being in a hurry.

352
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,834
Hurry? 
I'm not in a hurry!

353
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,270
So, shall we have 
an aperitif at Conti?

354
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,270
No, 
I just got the time for...

355
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,638
Do you really want to handle money
under the arcades... people watching!

356
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,112
- I've got my car.
- Oh no, I've got little time.

357
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,798
That's right. I'll take you
and give you the money on the way.

358
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:27,388
But if you don't want, we can meet
tomorrow in a more secluded place.

359
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,156
- Where's the car?
- There - One minute only

360
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,870
Two coffees and the bill.

361
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:59,630
Some nice music, a casual meeting,
two cars too close...

362
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,031
An unexpected win,
but substantial

363
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,637
- I hate this 2000 lire business.
- Why? - They bother me.

364
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,839
I would give anything to stop 
this business between us.

365
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,516
It's easy, 
as long as you...

366
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,479
As long as 
I don't talk about it.

367
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,110
Right! Let's not talk about it
anymore as if it never existed.

368
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,636
Let's talk about us.

369
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,714
About us? 
Don't you think it's too much?

370
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,032
I'd suggest 
to sort it out, like you say.

371
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,753
Let's sort 
the financial issue.

372
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,753
But who can guarantee 
I will see you again?

373
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,278
I'm not saying you came for
the 2000 lire which are nothing...

374
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:52,197
- Well, not just "nothing"...
- Yes, but they are the reason...

375
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:58,236
- Countess, I won't give you
the 2000 lire - Why?

376
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,315
Because I want 
to keep this link between us.

377
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,035
Next meeting we'll
talk about the 2000 lire.

378
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,635
Enough now.

379
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,839
- All right then,
but let's go now - As you wish.

380
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,038
- May I see you again?
- Of course!

381
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,436
- Oh my god! - What happened?
- Look at this!

382
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,639
- I'm sorry. Luckily it's nothing.
- Don't you see what a rip?

383
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,032
- A couple of stitches...
- Yes, two stitches! What shall I do?

384
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,636
What now? A new dress... 
you can't understand.

385
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,839
Even with two stitches one can
see it's broken. Let's go!

386
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,469
- Where?
- Downtown, hurry up!

387
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,233
- You haven't told me 
when we'll meet again.

388
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,233
I don't know now, 
I can't say.

389
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,632
- And that money? - Well, 
let's sort this business now.

390
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,032
- Now? But I want to wait.
- And I want it now.

391
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,637
- This sort of blackmail 
is bothering me - Blackmail?

392
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,237
I start thinking 
you came for the money only.

393
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,538
Of course, what do you expect?

394
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,238
If it's so, 
you'll have your 2000 lire.

395
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,436
- Will I?
- Yes.

396
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,798
I didn't bring it because I thought
the meeting'd have gone differently.

397
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,636
- I'll send my servant today.
- Give it to my housemaid.

398
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,032
- Where?
- At 18:15 in Duca D'Aosta Square.

399
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,035
- Well, where shall I take you?
- To the Grand Hotel, please.

400
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,752
Wait to take the suitcases, they
may be mixed with someone's else.

401
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,629
- How much?
- 13.50 with the luggage.

402
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,974
13.50 for a couple of steps?

403
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,874
Couple of steps? 
We crossed the city!

404
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,318
Look at the meter after all!

405
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,318
- I'll give you 5 lire.
- The price is right.

406
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,235
- How do you know it's right?
- Calm down, Mrs.

407
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,429
- I won't be cheated.
- Cheat? What a fool!

408
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,912
- Did you say 'fool'?
- No! The lady is a bit upset.

409
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,518
Get a doctor 
and ask for a cure!

410
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,518
Rude and lout! 
Taking advantage of a woman!

411
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,038
- Slap him for me please!
- Me? - I give you 5 lire!

412
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,637
- I'll sort it out, Mrs.
- Would you slap me?

413
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,429
I don't even think about it,
here 20 lire and enjoy Ishtar!

414
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,550
Gino, she just came!

415
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,679
- I saw her, move now.
- Have she seen you? - Sure.

416
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,037
- When?
- Two hours ago, at the arcades.

417
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,028
What? I'm talking about aunt!

418
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,628
She came now and 
she's worse than the plague!

419
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,590
I had to tell her you had the fever.
If she sees us here, she'll kill us!

420
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,796
Let's go!

421
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,038
- Where's the hatbox?
- It's gone!

422
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,400
- It can't be possible.
- It is, with all such a bedlam!

423
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,639
- May I help you Madam?
- I'm waiting for someone but maybe...

424
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:26,228
- If you'd give me the name I'll check.
- It doesn't matter. Mrs Rossi.

425
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,040
- She has arrived just now.
- Who?

426
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,556
Mrs Marta Rossi, haven't you 
asked about her?

427
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,951
Have you asked about me? 
You can go.

428
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,398
- Have you asked about me?
- No, I mean, yes.

429
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,599
- What does that mean?
- It's a misunderstanding.

430
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,311
What misunderstanding? You asked for
Mrs Rossi, that's me you see.

431
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,076
I thought that you 
hadn't come and then...

432
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,312
You asked about me because you 
thought I hadn't arrived.

433
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,030
Let me go, please. 
Goodbye.

434
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,556
- Don't try to leave or 
I'll stop you - What?

435
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,236
Who are you? 
Let's see, you are...

436
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,229
You are a customer 
from Primavera stores.

437
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,429
No, I'm an employee there.

438
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,752
- Employee how, what, where?
- At the Maison Printemps.

439
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,390
- What?
- Model at the Maison Printemps.

440
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,633
Printemps! 'Primavera Stores' 
sounds better!

441
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,838
So you are a model 
at the Primavera Stores.

442
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,517
He gave you 
this dress to come here...

443
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,639
and inquire about me, didn't you?
- You are wrong, Mrs!

444
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,919
- This is a rip.
- Let me explain.

445
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,628
Come to my room.

446
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,072
- But Madam!
- Undress over there.

447
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,116
- Madam, I've got...
- Undress!

448
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,735
Can someone sew in here?

449
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,035
- Sew? - Mending a rip 
with thread and needle!

450
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,033
- I'll send the cloakwork attendant.
- Well do that then!

451
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,229
I'll show your manager. This time
I'm gonna have some fun

452
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,836
Put this dressing gown on.

453
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,638
Come in!

454
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,031
- I'm the cloackroom attendant.
- Look at this dress.

455
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,352
- Pretty! - I didn't ask 
your opinion! Look at the rip.

456
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,558
- Oh dear, what happened?
- Mind your own business!

457
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,234
Fix it, and hurry up.

458
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,236
Sit there.

459
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,349
It's my fault. 
I took the dress furtively.

460
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,160
- You've got some cheek!
- What are you saying?

461
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,439
I'm saying you wore 
that dress under

462
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,439
the manager's order 
and I want to know why!

463
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,029
If he'd know that 
I took that dress,

464
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,629
going out with that dress, 
I'd be ruined.

465
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,998
- You insist! - He said that 
the dress is horrible.

466
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,196
Horrible ?

467
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,468
- He said the dress is horrible.
- Yes, that's what he said.

468
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,271
- So, this dress is horrible.
- Not for me. I like it a lot.

469
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,115
I've never seen such 
a lovely dress before!

470
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,798
- Just the idea of those cuffs...
- The idea of those cuffs then?

471
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,034
- It's original.
- And the fabric?

472
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,037
Oh the fabric, the fabric is 
extraordinary! Soft, light...

473
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,238
- I've got to say you wear it well.
- You're too kind.

474
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,632
You wear it finely
You picked a good choice.

475
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,874
Don't worry about your manager; 
if he says anything...

476
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,874
actually, 
I'll call him now.

477
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,475
I won't move from here.

478
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,429
I want to be the first to meet 
such an arrogant hick coming here...

479
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,640
Hello? 
This is the Maison Printemps.

480
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,836
The Grand Hotel?

481
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,913
- Widow Rossi.
- Ah, widow Rossi!

482
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,236
Hello?

483
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,238
Go away, please, 
do me a favour, go away.

484
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,109
Close the door 
and don't let anyone in.

485
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,356
Hello?

486
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,431
Yes Madam, it's me.

487
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,639
I'm eager to meet you.

488
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,632
What? Paris? 
No, Paris can wait

489
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,269
I didn't want 
to miss the pleasure...

490
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,478
You'll give me the pleasure 
and honour tonight.

491
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,029
What?

492
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,035
Is it ok if I come tonight?
I'll come tomorrow then.

493
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,793
Enough, you talk too much! 
Goodbye.

494
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,639
Done. I have treated him bad, 
haven't I?

495
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,635
Maybe, but that little voice 
was so tantalizing...

496
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,599
After 20 years, 
it's always the same!

497
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,796
The same voice!

498
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,997
Come here, 
who told you to go away?

499
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,228
20 years passed by and who knows
what happened to her!

500
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,472
Marta Piacentini, 
widow Rossi...

501
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,678
- It must be her!
- Who Sir?

502
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,437
A woman from the times gone,
when I was young, rich...

503
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,796
..and I was traveling for fun.

504
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,160
He was a penniless, a 
poor traveling salesman.

505
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,751
She fell head 
over heels for me.

506
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,072
He insisted, 
threatened to kill himself!

507
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,111
Jealous and so much in love! 
She wanted me all for herself.

508
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,479
I trusted him a bit 
and in the end 

509
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,879
I became fond of him, 
like I was of a cat.

510
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,272
Poor woman!
Maybe I'd have married her...

511
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,833
if in my life Henriette 
wouldn't have appeared!

512
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,631
From a French noble family, 
rich, smart, refined...

513
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,678
...living in famous hotels, 
stylish!

514
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,230
And do you know who 
that French woman was?

515
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,554
The cashier from 
a day hotel in Marsiglia.

516
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,078
Men? You can 
never trust men, my child!

517
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,832
- Very well!
- Who was it? - Nobody.

518
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,473
I just tested the bell, 
you're pitiful.

519
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,554
Stop it! I'll get dressed put 
the shoes on and go away now.

520
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,758
- Where to?
- To find the 2.000 lire, yeah?

521
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,629
- I've got to find it by 6 o'clock.
- Where? - Wherever.

522
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,158
If you find them, 
you'll do everyone a favour.

523
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,236
Wait.

524
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,329
It's half past three Madam, 
in 5 minutes.

525
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,829
I've got to be at the Stores.

526
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,153
You're right, 
I like you a lot!

527
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,236
Hello? Yes, put him through!

528
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,029
My nephew: I wouldn't 
recommend him to you! A rascal! 

529
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,478
You can go, I'll give you the dress
as  present because you're nice...

530
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,234
..and I make you 
Store supervisor.

531
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,871
You're dear, good and kind and 
for this... let's not anticipate.

532
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,638
- Come here tonight at 8 bang on time.
- All right Madam, thank you!

533
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,269
Hello? Who is it?

534
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,638
I'm the big one 
who slapped the driver.

535
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,917
I need to tell you that your 
nephew is in bad condition.

536
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,949
He's delirious 
and moans, poor thing!

537
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,914
I gave him 
two injections already.

538
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,674
Yes, Fitina injections.

539
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,038
I see, apply 
a hot poultice, two actually!

540
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,396
I've done that!

541
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,439
He was so hot that I had to 
place an ice bag on his head.

542
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,949
Very well. Let's check 
the temperature first,

543
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,949
and then let's make 
a couple more. Thermometer!

544
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,477
#incomprehensible words#

545
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,130
Like I thought, 
he's not running a temperature.

546
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,430
That's very worrying.

547
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,232
If he had the fever, 
we could say:

548
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,232
'Poor thing, 
he's got a fever' but...

549
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,029
I understand, 
if I give you the 2000 lire...

550
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,171
and he wastes them with 
his crooked life-style, 

551
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,671
and then asks for more.

552
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,233
No! You've got to change life-style,
stop such a damned sport!

553
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,870
- What? - Shut up!
- Are we in the army?

554
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,434
You've got to have a family. 
I could introduce 

555
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,034
you a good girl for instance...

556
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,431
- Who knows how to make meatballs.
- My dear!

557
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,037
Meatballs are important
in marriage relationship.

558
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,638
Yeah, right! 
If you think that I'll

559
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,638
sell you my soul for 2000 lire, 
you're wrong!

560
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,229
It's 3 hours I'm suffocating under 
the sheets to gain what? Same lecture!

561
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,913
You're a rogue! 
Where are you going? 

562
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,713
To a woman who doesn't 
know how to make meatballs.

563
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,513
- A woman? So even this morning then...
- Yes, I was with a woman.

564
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,832
Who knows what kind of woman!

565
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,232
A wonderful, 
elegant and beautiful woman!

566
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,156
- Excellent - Who wants 2000 lire.
- It's her's!

567
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,635
God! Do you let 
a woman supporting you?

568
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,635
No, I owe her 2000 lire.

569
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,992
Yesterday at the horse races... 

570
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:10,992
too long to explain, 
but it's a serious thing.

571
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,634
If you care about 
the family honour,

572
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,634
give the 2000 lire 
to Marco. Goodbye.

573
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,676
Madam...

574
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,933
Did he give them to you?

575
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,833
Listen, I won't step 
in your house ever again!

576
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,036
I...

577
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,316
What are you gonna 
do now poor sonny?

578
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,028
What do you 
expect me to do?

579
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,239
'A nice dream has finished but,
better to confess you everything'

580
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,951
'I'll try to give you the sum back
within two, three days. Gino Vanni.'

581
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,231
I told her that I would have 
sent my servant...

582
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,029
- Servant? Am I supposed to be
your servant? - So what?

583
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,432
I'm good, generous but...

584
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,069
I get it, I'll go myself.

585
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,031
We've arrived, 
I'm going away.

586
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,829
But the servant 
doesn't know you.

587
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,229
I'll wait for you 
at that coffeehouse.

588
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,233
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

589
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:29,635
I don't want the servant may 
think that I came to check.

590
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,155
He came himself!

591
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,631
- Shall I go then?
- Yes, I'll wait here for you.

592
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:47,398
- What if he courts me?
- Not a problem.

593
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,750
Are you Mr Vanni's servant?

594
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,958
- Don't be smart! Give it
to the lady - Lady? Ah!

595
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:16,229
Are you always so rude 
when you meet a girl?

596
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,892
I don't have time to waste.

597
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,637
Good day, 
are you surprised that I came?

598
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,031
- Forgive me Countess...
- Are you not taking me for a walk?

599
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,432
- Did you get the envelope?
- Sure.

600
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,638
Now all is clear 
and we can talk.

601
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,159
- So, don't you want to take me
for a walk? - At your service.

602
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,029
- Can we talk to the driver?
- Sure.

603
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,037
- The walking is not pleasing you.
- Not really. Those damned 2000 lire...

604
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,636
We gave too much 
importance to that money.

605
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,637
You sealed them in the envelope, me 
in the handbag. Let's change subject.

606
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,235
- So you believe...
- Let's change subject!

607
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,631
- Look at my dress.
- Pretty.

608
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:45,238
It doesn't cost more than 200 lire,
What does that make you think?

609
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,395
Distrust of my car? By the way,
Have you managed to fix it?

610
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,756
Yes, it was nothing.

611
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,232
- The cloackroom attendant fixed it.
- The cloackroom attendant? - Yes

612
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,190
Have you looked at it carefully?
Don't I look a model?

613
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,592
- A model?
- A little tailor, a hatter.

614
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:12,198
What are you saying? You can't think
of mingling with some sort of girls.

615
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,629
The dress is not important, 
it depends who wears it...

616
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,014
The model, the tailor..
it's a matter of style.

617
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,314
at the end of the day.

618
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:28,113
- I could never be with such women.
- Why have you stopped?

619
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,636
- Where are we going?
- I don't want to go too far.

620
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,237
- Are you in a hurry to go back?
- Yes - I'll go back then.

621
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,391
What are you doing?

622
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,070
A few kilometers 
and we'll be there.

623
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:06,031
- I'm afraid we won't meet again.
- So what? - In that envelope...

624
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,479
You're still talking 
about that nasty issue!

625
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,235
- You're right, but in that 
envelope, Countess... - Well!

626
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,439
I forbid you to talk about it
and to call me Countess.

627
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,638
You don't want 
to tell me your name.

628
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,038
I'll tell you if you wish.

629
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,637
- Marcella - Nice. I always 
loved such a name.

630
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,831
Do you know many
women with that name? 

631
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,031
No, you are the first.

632
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,955
I mean, no other 
woman's name is so nice.

633
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,794
- Let's go - This way?
- No, that way.

634
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,395
- Shame!
- Why such a big sigh?

635
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,030
I told you. I've got the feeling
that we won't see each others again.

636
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,113
I swear I was really 
fond of you, Countess.

637
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:46,037
- My words would sound 
ridiculous after - After? When?

638
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,056
- Don't open it now Countess!

639
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,756
- Oh no! Remember what 
you said this morning?

640
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,792
'I won't give you 
the 2.000 lire, so...'

641
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,792
- So what? 
- Take them back

642
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,112
- But Countess...
- I beg you.

643
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,036
Countess, I...

644
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,830
Just promise to me not trying
to find out who I am.

645
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,354
You have my word.

646
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,031
Countess, it's 8 o'clock, 
satisfied of the driver?

647
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,798
- Yes, tomorrow then - For our 
own appointment or our servants'?

648
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,068
- Our servants'.
- At quarter past six.

649
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,472
That lady who went upstairs...

650
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,633
- She goes to number 148.
- 148, thanks!

651
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,030
Miss, come.

652
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,875
10, 20...

653
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,230
- 37 and 80 of these roses.
- 37 and 80?

654
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,031
Yes, it's that simple. send them
to the the Grand Hotel, room 148...

655
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,157
..from Gino Vanni, 
tomorrow at dawn.

656
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:33,230
Son, you couldn't say 
sorry in a better way!

657
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,836
The roses moved me, 
you deserve a kiss!

658
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,029
You've found a way to take 
that money from me, you rascal!

659
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:47,308
- How much did you say?
- 2000 lire - I thought 3000.

660
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,518
I always exaggerate, here.

661
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,630
Stop it!

662
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,032
Enough talking, another kiss 
and I'll go away.

663
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,638
I'll wait for you at the Grand Hotel 
tonight, there'll be a big party.

664
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,030
At 8 o'clock!

665
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,638
She could've put 1000 lire
for me too!

666
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,031
- What happened? - The florist 
must have made a mistake.

667
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,875
I'll give her 
the 2000 lire at once!

668
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,398
- So, tonight at the appointment...
- Don't forget lunch with aunt.

669
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,598
- You go there.
- Me? No!

670
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:35,229
All right then so, I'll
get the taxi fare back.

671
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,029
- But you go to bed at 9!
- Yes.

672
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,271
But at quarter 
past six my dear...

673
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:48,039
Tonight you won't go out so you will 
celebrate your new manager post.

674
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,910
You got in touch with Mrs Rossi
trying to bypass me.

675
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:58,393
- I explained it was a coincidence.
- A coincidence? Should I believe you?

676
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,509
Describe Mrs Ross, 
what does she look like?

677
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,231
I'm not worried of that hick. 
She'd feel lost...

678
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:14,635
..among the customers I created. Today
I invited the Marchioness of Lambergo. 

679
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,310
A rosé dress.

680
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,839
I know Mrs Rossi since 20 years, 
born Piacentini.

681
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:08,392
She'll find out 
when she sees me.

682
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,634
She'll wrap her hands around my neck
and I'll make her jump like that!

683
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,713
..like a grasshopper!

684
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,631
Marta, dear, why...

685
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:31,228
Stay there! I don't know you and
I don't tolerate such liberty.

686
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,429
Let's get to the point, what
do you want to do?

687
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,638
I'll go by your arrangements.

688
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:45,637
Too easy! I arrange 
and you criticize, no!

689
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,429
You'll arrange 
and I'll criticize.

690
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:55,232
If you'll let me do it, I have
a few ideas for the launch.

691
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,439
- Let's hear one - In three months...
- Three months are too many.

692
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,639
In a week there's 
an exhibition at Sestriere.

693
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,032
What are you plans today?

694
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,592
Tonight there's the opening 
season party at the Grand Hotel.

695
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:19,029
Dinner at eight, dancing and 10.
I'll personally take care...

696
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,635
- I'm sorry!
- One moment, please.

697
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,030
A table for three, good.

698
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,229
- How can I help? - I'd like to know
the room number of a Countess.

699
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,315
- She's young, beautiful, smart.
- May I have the name...

700
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,439
- If I knew the name...
- Cloackroom attendant to 115!

701
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,069
- Attendant?
- To 115

702
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,637
- Attendant, to 115.
- I'm going.

703
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,633
Yesterday you mended a black 
dress with ermine cuffs?

704
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,838
- Yes. - Do you know the lady 
who gave it to you?

705
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,038
- Sure.
- Here.

706
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,751
- Give her this - All right.
- In person.

707
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,638
'This money burns in my hands'
What a fool!

708
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:18,432
'When we'll meet tonight, the field
will be clear of financial issues'.

709
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,629
What clear field is he on about?
Romantic and loudmouth like his dad!

710
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,438
But I like him.

711
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,635
- Good evening young man.
- My nephew sent you to tell me...

712
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,475
The club suddenly called him...

713
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,029
I understand, he's not coming.

714
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,035
For the second time he prefers
a cow's company to his aunt.

715
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,635
No, for goodness sake!

716
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:26,479
Madam, you're not right entirely.
You always tackle him.

717
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:32,192
You tell him: 'No this, that's fine!'
And he does the opposite.

718
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:38,595
- Have you dined already?
- No, actually I...

719
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,798
I won't keep you then, 
goodbye.

720
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:07,232
- Marcella, where is she?
- She left her handbag in the car.

721
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,995
- What? The handbag in the car?
- Here she comes!

722
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:16,837
You risked5t 3 months salary by
forgetting your handbag in the car.

723
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:21,870
- I didn't forget the handbag.
- So why were you left behind?

724
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,792
The Countess can't come, 
she'll call you.

725
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:37,433
- She said don't try to see her tonight.
- Wait! Did she not say something else?

726
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,240
- No.
- Is that all? Where is she now?

727
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,110
- I don't know.
- You don't know? I understood!

728
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:50,314
But, I won't say 
anything... no!

729
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:52,949
Well, you maybe follow me.

730
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,029
So, who would you represent 
tonight? A princess?

731
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,511
- You tell me.
- Oh well, if you ask me...

732
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,998
These people 
in here have to believe.

733
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,598
But you, do you really 
like such a farce?

734
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:27,029
That wretched says that a good 
product is obvious by itself.

735
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,239
Such assumption 
works for wine and cheese.

736
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:38,238
We need a subtle advertising, 
pervasive. Look at this.

737
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,438
'Would you like 
your woman to adore you?'

738
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,638
'Buy the Maison Printemps 
toiletries'

739
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,635
- What do you reckon? - Tell me, 
do you dispense these tickets?

740
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,031
- I've got a great idea! Here.
- Sir?

741
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:59,037
Give them to the girls. 
While they dance, secretly...

742
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,831
the girls will slip the tickets
into their partners' pockets.

743
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,036
The day after 
everybody will read...

744
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,239
'Buy the Maison Printemps 
toiletries!'

745
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,429
- Fantastic! - For that you've got to
introduce the girls to all men...

746
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,240
so they'll dance nonstop. 
Agreed?

747
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,038
It depends.

748
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,030
On what?

749
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,034
Well, each introduction 
is a responsibility.

750
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,636
- The price?
- It's not up to me to say.

751
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,635
I trust your sense of understanding.
A Duke introducing, the tickets risk...

752
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,838
- Shall we do twenty lire?
- Twenty lire!

753
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:44,029
- Twenty-five?
- Let's say thirty.

754
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,633
All right thirty then.

755
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:55,032
- But where are you looking for me?
- Ah, it's you.

756
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,239
- What should I do to you?
- Sorry, aunty - No.

757
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,438
Don't be a bluster, 
you need the money.

758
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,537
I swear dear aunty 
that money right now

759
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,037
is the last thing in my mind!
- Yes!

760
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,319
These are the 2.000 lire 
that you sent me back.

761
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,331
What? The 2000 lire again? 
It's absurd!

762
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,031
Stop it, 
otherwise I beat you.

763
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:22,389
I'll give you another 2.000 to spend
and don't send them back to me.

764
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,598
Give them 
and we'll see this time.

765
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,230
Have fun 
with your great love!

766
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,836
Great love? 
For goodness sake!

767
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,038
It's not worth 
wasting some feelings.

768
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,239
It was just a fling, 
I won't think about it.

769
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:46,635
- I feared you were in love.
- Me in love?

770
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,031
Don't make me laugh! 
I'm not that naive.

771
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,239
It's ok to fall in love, 
but with a good girl.

772
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,632
- Who can cook meatballs.
- Yes, meatballs too!

773
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,237
Better the meatballs girl 
then that tramp...

774
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:09,999
of my butt who distributes small
tickets with the phone number on them.

775
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,710
Just a moment, aunty, 
I'll be right back.

776
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,831
Don't be too surprised,
but I can't stand.

777
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,831
this business 
about the tickets at all!

778
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:42,029
It's an order from your manager;
I don't have anything to do with it!

779
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,556
- Sure! - And then?
- Don't insist because...

780
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,639
- May I have a word?
- I'm sorry that you...

781
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,000
- You didn't expect it, didn't you?
- Don't speak like that to my cousin!

782
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:02,315
- Is she your cousin? I'm delighted!
- Do you want me to send him away?

783
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,315
- I want to give your money back.
- I am the duke of Fadda.

784
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,236
Pleased to meet you, Gino Vanni.
I want to give back to the lady...

785
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,832
2000 lire that she asked me 
to collect on her behalf. 

786
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,632
I wish to sort my debt out.

787
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,031
- Good idea. Do it then.
- One moment!

788
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,717
I don't remember 
of giving him such a task.

789
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,111
- But dear, we played all day
at the races! - It was another one.

790
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:33,070
And even if it was true, he shouldn't 
give me the money in here.

791
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,279
- So much quibbling... 
- That's enough, I don't know anything.

792
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,512
If I'll remember about that sum
I'll know how to ask it back.

793
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,796
No! It's me who says enough.
And that's why your duo

794
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:46,596
amused me for too long now!

795
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:52,151
Here the 2000 lire, 
do what you wish.

796
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,236
Countess, Duke!

797
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:07,831
Keep this money! You'll give it
back to me when I'll say so!

798
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:13,631
Merely after I tell
you are rude and I won't let

799
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,031
anyone treat me like that.

800
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,999
- Did you understand?
- Yes, I understood.

801
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,558
I understood 
many other things too!

802
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:30,035
I am rude because I didn't 
bow to the Countess...

803
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,239
or because last night I waited
one hour and fifteen minutes...

804
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:39,235
for the Countess to arrive?
- I would have explained.

805
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:43,032
Or maybe because I interrupted 
your flirting, 

806
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,032
your distributing 
of scented tickets?

807
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:50,229
- The tickets... - Would you have
explained that too - Sure.

808
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:55,634
I was so naive to believe you
worth of a feeling.

809
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:01,034
It's really funny! Tell it to 
the people of your world.

810
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,070
- Add me to your affairs.
- If you don't stop it...

811
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,235
I've got to be careful, you could
send me an entire a whole band.

812
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:15,439
And now that you've lost that 
little goodness I thought you had...

813
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:19,639
Do know that 
the other day I did notice...

814
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,429
in the envelope there was no money
but simply written paper!

815
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:27,958
- So, why did you get in the car?
- You always understand everything...

816
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,438
but maybe you'll 
never understand that!

817
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,836
Marcella!

818
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,436
Marcella!

819
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,833
- All is over then.
- It looks like.

820
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,834
- But the 2000 lire 
are still there. - What?

821
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,653
Now that we are 
all together dear manager,

822
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,353
I can tell you are a beast!

823
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,636
- Madam...
- Beast!

824
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,630
Your idea of taking the models 
to the Grand Hotel.

825
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,630
and join them to the party...

826
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,192
was totally silly!
- I've got to disagree!

827
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,433
It doesn't matter if you disagree,
that idea was silly nevertheless.

828
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:37,037
After all, do you think that kind of
advertising effective? Let's hear it!

829
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,637
- What do you reckon?
- I... - Don't be afraid.

830
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,031
They pinched me a lot!

831
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,276
I don't know if they did that 
'cause they thought I was 

832
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,276
or I wasn't a lady. Thing is
that I'm covered with bruises now.

833
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,229
The bruises have nothing to do with it.
They are the Miss personal business.

834
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:01,635
- Did they pinch you as well?
- Not me; but they made such advances!

835
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,675
- And you? Do you think that was
effective? - I don't know anything.

836
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:13,630
All I know is that I'm tired of 
pretending to be a lady when I'm not.

837
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,839
I'm simply a girl who needs to work.
I'll tell you one more thing...

838
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,154
I'm not going to Sestriere 
for the fashion show.

839
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,356
I won't go, I won't go 
and I won't go!

840
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,234
- What happened?
- Nothing, Madam.

841
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,632
- I can't live like this anymore.
- Have you argued with him?

842
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,237
- That fool doesn't understand 
anything! - Like all men.

843
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,835
I missed an appointment last night
because I needed to go 

844
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,235
to the Grand Hotel and he...

845
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,031
It's useless saying anything, 
it's all is over by now, 

846
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,031
but it doesn't matter, 
I don't care.

847
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,637
I see! Don't worry, 
there are many cute guys.

848
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:09,398
Enough now. I don't want to suffer
again like I did for him...

849
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:11,531
for that arrogant loudmouth!

850
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,031
- Tomorrow is sunday, you'll 
come with me to have good time.

851
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,037
Thanks, but I don't 
want to go anywhere.

852
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,037
Oh you can simply 
keep me company.

853
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,239
- Imagine, it's just a football match!
- The match against Switzerland?

854
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,439
- Oh, do you know anything about it?
- No, it's to keep you company.

855
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:31,148
Very well then. 
We agree in football too!

856
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,956
C'mon! Go on!

857
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:55,037
- C'mon, Gino!
- Do you know Gino Vanni?

858
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,637
- He's my nephew unfortunately.
- Your nephew?

859
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,637
Nothing to be proud of!

860
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,839
I've got a nephew who 
throws kicks, nice profession!

861
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,835
Few minutes before 
the end of the first half:

862
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,635
Italy 0 Switzerland 0.

863
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,838
Italy started attacking.

864
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,394
Vanni is in a great form but reluctant 
to kick towards the goal...

865
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,076
passes the ball 
to the right wing.

866
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,392
Why do you pass? Kick!

867
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:47,355
Vanni missed 
another chance to score.

868
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:54,631
Rascal, dirty rat!
Thinking about women, aren't you?

869
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,758
Like father like son. 
His father was a bowls champion!

870
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:19,438
The first half ended 
with the following score...

871
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,636
Italy 1 Switzerland 0.

872
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:26,670
Vanni scored 5 seconds before 
the end of the first half.

873
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:31,630
Good! A bit shrewd, 
but always a pretty boy.

874
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:36,829
I was afraid he fell 
in love... with a Countess.

875
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,435
- She would have ruined him.
- Why?

876
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,239
It doesn't matter, 
better like that!

877
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,639
What do you mean?

878
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:49,750
He said he wasn't in love, 
he just had fun!

879
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,959
Now I want him to settled down 
with a good girl.

880
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,835
I found her already, she doesn't 
have a dowry, but that 

881
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,035
doesn't matter. I'll take a million
from him and give it to her!

882
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,637
Madam, I regret what I said.

883
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,193
Please tell the manage 
I want to go to Sestriere.

884
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,193
Really? 
- Yes, it's better.

885
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:17,234
Good day! I've found you finally,
I've been looking for you for 5 days.

886
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,439
Would you be so kind as to tell me 
where the Countess' apartments are?

887
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,390
- Young man, you're talking nonsense.
- It's about the 2000 lire.

888
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,632
The 2000 lire? 
Please make yourself at home!

889
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:34,431
- Excuse me if I welcome you 
like this - So, your cousin?

890
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:36,832
I'm gonna meet her 
at Sestriere today.

891
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,832
- Is she in Sestriere? 
- Yes.

892
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,150
Yes, and if you hand 
the money over to me...

893
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,238
Happy now? 
Did you like those models?

894
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:11,031
Italian models, my ideas and he
believes he did it all yourself!

895
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,236
- But...
- But keep quiet!

896
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:20,596
- What's this stuff?
- This is the ultimate moment.

897
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:26,472
The wedding dress 
that ends the show.

898
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:33,432
Now you'll see a show 
of 12 very new models.

899
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:37,229
A girl, through her debutant stage 
to becoming a married lady.

900
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:43,749
It starts with a schoolgirl model
and it ends with an ultimate moment...

901
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,232
the wedding dress.
- C'mon! Who had such an idea?

902
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,235
Madam, I beg you.

903
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:59,632
We'll end up on the church magazine
'The family angel'.

904
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,237
- Give me the dress - A wedding
dress ending the fashion show!

905
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:11,238
It's my idea! You have always been
averse to the wedding dress...

906
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,439
and that's why 
I've added it in the show!

907
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:21,038
True men prefer smart women, 
low-necked...

908
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:25,239
but they need to understand that
they've got to marry them in the end!

909
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:30,270
- Only then fashion will have 
a meaning! - That's enough!

910
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:38,595
A wedding dress ending the show!
I resign!

911
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,878
Miss Marcella, come here!

912
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,048
What's the matter 
of being so cheerful?

913
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:58,398
It's thanks to you, Madam. 
To hell with gloominess!

914
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:02,599
- What does that mean?
- I stopped being a fool.

915
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,038
I want to enjoy my youth 
and whatever happens, happens!

916
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,038
I'm gonna slap you.

917
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,511
I'm sorry,
but I've got to change dress!

918
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,228
All right, 
we'll talk about it later.

919
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:20,239
Are you a soccer 
or a sportscar champion?

920
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,232
Soccer!

921
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,238
I'm feeling cold, 
if we'd get a cup of tea...

922
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,435
Thanks but I don't have time. 
Where's your cousin?

923
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,235
Wait on a minute. 
We came all the way here...

924
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,234
Give me the money 
and I'll take it to her.

925
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,634
I need 
to give it personally.

926
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,474
- So, will you wait for me here?
- With pleasure!

927
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,032
- How come are you here?
- I wanted to go for a trip.

928
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:30,239
- With your beautiful lady.
- No, it's over.

929
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,031
- By the way, you mentioned 
of a girl... - Well, she's here.

930
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,432
- Here?
- she's smart, elegant...

931
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,831
- Enough, I accept!
- Without seeing her?

932
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,835
As long as you like her. 
Is she a cripple? No! 

933
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,835
Hunchback? No! 
So, I'll marry her then.

934
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:51,152
I'll get engaged 
this very night.

935
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:57,032
Tell her that she has my agreement,
or rather that I am in love.

936
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:03,675
- May I?
- You again!

937
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,639
Yes, me again,
but for few seconds only!

938
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,228
Just the time to give you 
these printed sheets!

939
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,228
They aren't written,
but printed!

940
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,029
- Have you come here on purpose?
- No, I'm passing by.

941
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,432
- Good luck, Countess.
- Thanks, same to you.

942
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,958
- Are you leaving now?
- No, I'm staying just 

943
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,958
for a formality. I'm 
gonna get engaged tonight.

944
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,637
Really? Congratulations, 
when will you marry?

945
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,838
- I don't know yet but soon, within
the current month! - What a hurry!

946
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,676
Are you afraid 
to change your mind?

947
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,676
No, I'm determined 
and very much in love.

948
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:42,435
How touching! 
Is your fiancée beautiful?

949
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:47,834
I don't know... I mean, I know it!
She's beautiful and, above all, nice.

950
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:54,474
Nice, affectionate and loyal.
Do you know what 'loyal' means?

951
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:59,555
- It's not one of those women who are...
- I wish you a lot of happiness.

952
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:06,239
But make sure not 
letting such a nice girl...

953
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,951
waiting too long because of me!
- You're wrong!

954
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:18,231
- My fiancée... - I've got to go 
to the tailor and measure a dress.

955
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,271
Actually, if you come back 
in 10 minutes, I also 

956
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,271
want to give you 
an advice and some news.

957
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,159
Very well, 
see you later Countess!

958
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,992
(host) Engagement!

959
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,269
First kiss.

960
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,029
Waiting.

961
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,231
What a surprise, isn't it? 
It suits me, don't you think?

962
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:33,473
It feels a bit funny 
in here but it's nothing.

963
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,829
You look so surprised because 
you don't know my name. 

964
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,829
Everybody talked 
about it these days!

965
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,231
But you could've seen 
it on the papers.

966
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:49,430
I obtained my marriage dissolution
and tomorrow I'll get married here.

967
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,334
It's a strange idea, 
but we're a group of friends.

968
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,834
and here it'll 
be more cheerful.

969
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,232
Weddings are always depressing.

970
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,232
Of course! 
You know that by experience!

971
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,916
- That dress has an imperfection.
- What?

972
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:07,676
- Yes, orange flowers.
- Orange flowers?

973
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,438
I heard they 
are a symbol of purity...

974
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:13,438
When a man insults 
a woman, he's a lout...

975
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,896
Go away, you insulted me enough!
It's all over now!

976
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,596
I wouldn't start 
it again for anything!

977
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,274
Go then once 
and for all. I'm busy!

978
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,718
Yes! For a woman like you 
marriage is just a dress!

979
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:50,593
Better a poor common girl, 
a tailor, a hatter...

980
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,515
those who live 
because they work! Understand?

981
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:58,719
They've got heart, 
they know what love is...

982
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,033
and embody more nobility than 
all the countesses on earth.

983
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,939
That's how I wanted my woman, 
uncomplicated, 

984
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:07,239
without frills and jewels.

985
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:12,235
- But with a big heart!
- Can't you see what I am?

986
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,278
- What are you?
- A mannequin!

987
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,035
In italian it's "fashion model". 
That's what you say!

988
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:23,637
You? And do you work 
in my aunty's firm?

989
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,037
Yes, at Primavera Stores!

990
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:31,992
So I know where to find you then!
Via Roma, 148. Telephone: 62347!

991
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,038
What an idea! Great! Great!

992
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,393
- I withdraw my resignation
- You withdraw your ideas! - Sure.
