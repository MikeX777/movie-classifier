00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:29,822
THE FORBIDDEN PHOTOS
OF A LADY ABOVE SUSPICION

2
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,578
Today,
I will give up cigarettes.

3
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,664
I will neither drink whiskey,
nor take these pills.

4
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,251
They say it's bad for you
to take both at the same time.

5
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,338
That should make Pier happy.

6
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,196
Do you know what I'm going to do tonight?
I'm going to eat at the fisherman's.

7
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,032
And I will call you from there.

8
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,743
I will tell you that I'm having dinner
with somebody else.

9
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,679
Dominique is right.
I should dress less like a decent lady.

10
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,226
There we go.
Maybe I should loosen this a little.

11
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,979
The way you like it.

12
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,402
When you return tomorrow night,
I won't let you make love right away.

13
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,321
I'll tell you
that I'm in love with someone else,

14
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,033
that we have to get a divorce,
but we could still be friends.

15
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,037
Then, after you make a terrible scene...

16
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,813
I swear that this is
absolutely my last one.

17
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,523
I won't take another.

18
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,560
- What do you want?
- You.

19
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,015
What do you want? What do you want?
Leave me alone!

20
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,018
It's no use, Minou,
you can't escape from me.

21
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,322
No, I'm not going to force you.

22
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,742
You will... you will have to beg me.

23
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,620
You will be begging me to take you.

24
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,914
On your knees!

25
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,586
On the ground!

26
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,500
If you want to know why your husband
has sent you here, I can tell you.

27
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,504
If you try to tell me that my husband
has a lover, I will never believe you!

28
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,673
We are one.

29
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,675
Your husband doesn't cheat on you.

30
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:53,390
He's a murderer.

31
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,641
No...

32
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,477
No... no...

33
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,193
You can go now.

34
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,973
No, no, I'll wait for you!
Bye, Pier. Take care.

35
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,690
A cognac, please.

36
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,622
Thank you.
Pour me another one.

37
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,553
Another beer, please.

38
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,443
Sit down.

39
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,985
- Minou.
- Pier!

40
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,659
Oh, my darling,
thank God!

41
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:25,584
He pinned me down,
and sat on me... with a knife.

42
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,588
Then, all of a sudden, he let me go.

43
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,299
If I got you right,
nothing really happened.

44
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,968
He held you down,
threatened you with a knife,

45
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,095
and then he disappeared like a ghost.

46
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,223
Look at what he did to my dress!

47
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,062
I ran into that bar
because I didn't want to be alone.

48
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,899
I wanted to be around people.

49
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,234
He said...

50
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,153
...he said that...

51
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,696
Oh, my God!

52
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,449
What if he had killed me?

53
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,535
But all of a sudden...

54
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,080
...he let me go.

55
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,457
But why didn't you
inform the police right away?

56
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:10,253
- Let's go there now.
- No, they just make you fill in forms.

57
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,677
Alright, it's up to you, darling.
But we have to go back to town now.

58
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:22,265
Excuse me. Unfortunately, I have to make
an urgent call to Munich.

59
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,892
I'm waiting downstairs, huh?

60
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,918
- Pier...
- What is it?

61
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:54,548
- I'm sorry for making you come here.
- Don't be, it's OK.

62
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,300
I had already postponed
all meetings for today.

63
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,762
So we could spend the weekend
together tomorrow.

64
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,641
But instead...
you get jumped by Jack the Ripper.

65
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,108
- You're back on them?
- No, no, it's an old bottle.

66
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,235
Yes, sure, an old bottle...

67
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,404
- Let's go.
- Yes, yes.

68
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,747
- Darling...
- Yes?

69
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:33,670
If this maniac had done something,
would you still love me?

70
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,382
That problem could have arisen
if you had told me: "Pier, I have a lover."

71
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:42,846
But why should I love you less because
someone has assaulted and raped you?

72
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,639
I'd still love you anyway.

73
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,641
Even if I would've been raped
by a blonde?

74
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,438
Pier... please don't joke about this.

75
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,065
Today I learned
how important you are for me.

76
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,610
That took you a while...

77
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,628
Hi.

78
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,797
That was Pier on the phone.
He will get here later.

79
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,674
- What?
- I talked to Pier.

80
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,426
He said, he'll be here later!

81
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,221
- I knew it. Always the same old story.
- Don't get upset.

82
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,556
- What?
- Don't get upset!

83
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:29,017
- Wanna dance?
- Sure.

84
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,881
Oh, look who's there!

85
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,345
- Who is she?
- Minou, she's a friend. I'll introduce you.

86
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,223
Wait for me at the table.
You come with me.

87
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,313
Who is the most beautiful girl
in the world?

88
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,107
- You!
- No, you!

89
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,525
Giorgio, Pier's right-hand man.
Dominique.

90
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,776
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

91
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,653
- Alessandro. Minou and Giorgio.
- Pleasure.

92
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,196
- Dance!
- Dance with her.

93
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,614
With pleasure.

94
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,621
Come on, Dominique, throw.
100!

95
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,917
- 200!
- I'll call.

96
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,045
Oh! Four kings!

97
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,589
Now don't make a toss
like the poor Dubois.

98
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,925
Dubois? Jean Dubois?
What did he do?

99
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,093
Don't you know?

100
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,221
They found him dead four days ago
while you were at the seaside.

101
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,355
Your husband doesn't cheat on you.

102
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,690
He's a murderer.

103
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,151
Wake up, Minou!

104
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,946
- Murdered?
- It wouldn't surprise me.

105
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,698
Everyone was wishing him the worst.

106
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,951
But no, Dubois died
from a cerebral embolism.

107
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,371
Why don't we talk
about something more cheerful?

108
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,789
- You're totally right.
- Hi.

109
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:57,123
- Wanna dance?
- Sure.

110
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,385
FINANCIER DUBOIS
FOUND DEAD IN HIS BED

111
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,847
"Similar diagnosis usually follows

112
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,643
"after severe accidents caused
by prolonged deep immersion

113
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,854
"followed by rapid surfacing

114
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,191
"without allowing sufficient time
for decompression.

115
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,570
"A phenomenon that perplexes
medical doctors. "

116
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:37,205
Prolonged deep immersion,
followed by rapid surfacing...

117
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,209
A phenomenon that perplexes
medical doctors...

118
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,182
Hey...

119
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,410
Prolonged deep immersion,
followed by rapid surfacing...

120
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,752
A phenomenon that perplexes
medical doctors...

121
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,253
Have you read what they say?

122
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,007
I hate to be cynical,
but he died at exactly the right moment.

123
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,175
He gave me a big loan.

124
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,511
But you have to pay it anyway, right?
There might be heirs.

125
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,723
Yes, yes, naturally.
They'll jump all over me.

126
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,644
Let's hope they'll contact us
as late as possible.

127
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,359
- Pier...
- What?

128
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,905
If something happened to you,
please, tell me.

129
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,783
No. At least nothing you need
to bother your little head about.

130
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,328
By the way, I won't be home
for lunch today.

131
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,079
I have a business breakfast.

132
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,665
But we have so little time together.

133
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,753
Give me some more time, please.

134
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,506
You'll see that everything will change.
I promise.

135
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,342
Alright.

136
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:21,309
- I'll go to Dominique.
- Do you want to make me jealous?

137
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,770
Because she has no qualms about
going to bed with someone?

138
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,272
But darling,
Dominique likes everyone.

139
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,818
And you should know that
all too well.

140
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,446
Weren't you with her
before my beauty hit you like lightning?

141
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,698
That's certainly true.

142
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,786
- Things to do today...
- Yes, sir!

143
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,914
At 5 o'clock, after visiting Dominique's,

144
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,376
come to my office
to meet Commissioner Poretti.

145
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:51,881
- No, Minou, you'll make me late.
- Yes, sir, be late.

146
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,347
Yes, yes, alright.

147
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,894
If that nag calls again, tell her that
the furnishing will be ready by the 15th.

148
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,689
Remind them to give you the check.

149
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,775
Who?
The photographer?

150
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,820
No, tell him I will call him back.

151
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,489
Ah, listen, I won't come in today.

152
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,908
No. Bye.

153
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,707
Come on, relax.
Is it still bothering you?

154
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,167
I can't see the problem.

155
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,962
Some guy suddenly jumps on you
in an isolated place...

156
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,756
It's basically a compliment
on your sex appeal.

157
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:37,302
Then you either like him and stay with him,
or you don't and dump him.

158
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,389
I wish something like this
would happen to me.

159
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,808
But what did he say to you?

160
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,604
He told me he knew something
that could harm Pier.

161
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,647
Don't tell me you're that gullible.

162
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,609
What should he know about Pier
that everybody else wouldn't know?

163
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,237
And have you seen him again?

164
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,116
So why are you worried about it?
You better not tell Pier about it.

165
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,535
In the end, he might accuse you
of having seduced him.

166
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,289
Yes, you're right. I'm way too gullible.

167
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,334
Let's go to my place.
I have some new stuff I'd like to show you.

168
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,302
- For you.
- Thank you.

169
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,696
What do you think?

170
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,366
Beautiful. Who took them?

171
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,285
A photographer, a new one.
I don't know him that well.

172
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,121
I assure you, he's not too shabby
for a weekend.

173
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,373
He performs well...

174
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,751
- But what if he sold them?
- That would be great! What publicity!

175
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,962
There would be a line at my door.

176
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,803
- Have a whiskey.
- Gladly.

177
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,934
- Won't you have one, too?
- No, thanks.

178
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,482
If it doesn't shock you,
I have something even more interesting.

179
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,192
Take a look.

180
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,820
- Pornographic photos?
- Have you ever seen any?

181
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,155
There's some good stuff
even in that genre.

182
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,993
Look.

183
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,127
Look at this one.
And don't tell me you don't like them.

184
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,589
I thought this wasn't your thing.

185
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,343
I like it all.
As long as it gives me pleasure.

186
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,930
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

187
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,976
You and Pier...
Well, you know...

188
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,895
When you introduced me to him,
you two were very friendly...

189
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,398
...but how friendly?

190
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,985
- You want me to go into detail?
- I'm sorry.

191
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,864
It's in the past.
Besides, he was never my type.

192
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,412
It was my fault, naturally.

193
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,206
I like a change from time to time.

194
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,247
What have you found?
It's a pretty stupid one.

195
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,501
- How did you get this one?
- How did I get this one?

196
00:22:56,626 --> 00:23:00,088
I went to Copenhagen.
They sell them in supermarkets there.

197
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:04,675
- Can I borrow it?
- Sure. Take it, it's a gift.

198
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,937
As I was saying, signora,
these things happen quite often.

199
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,730
Sex maniacs.

200
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:22,443
It was very wise to play along.
Otherwise, it might have been dangerous.

201
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:27,615
Don't you worry, however.
In general, they don't come back.

202
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,745
In any case,
here are my telephone numbers.

203
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,000
- I hope it won't happen again.
- Always at your service.

204
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:41,129
- Thank you.
- Excuse me, but I have to run.

205
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,047
- Bye, Pier.
- Goodbye.

206
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,424
- And good luck for your business.
- Thank you.

207
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:49,095
- I hope it all goes really smooth.
- I hope so, too.

208
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,346
- Goodbye, signora.
- Goodbye.

209
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,722
This way.

210
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,144
Please, Commissioner.
Goodbye.

211
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,104
- Bye, Pier.
- Bye.

212
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,783
Signorina, where's Giorgio?

213
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,077
Good, send him in right away.

214
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,041
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm sorry, darling.

215
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:25,923
Is there something wrong?
I'm your wife, I have a right to know.

216
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,051
I already told you, Minou,
things aren't going so well at the moment.

217
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,847
But I hope to recoup everything
with the next season.

218
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,016
- They're putting pressure on me.
- Who?

219
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,894
The creditors, the bank,
the financers...

220
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,729
People like Dubois?

221
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,902
I want you to explain something.

222
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:49,947
Why does this damned Dubois
pop up every time we talk?

223
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:51,949
Because he's dead.

224
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,827
So let the dead rest,
and think about us for a change, OK?

225
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,330
Look at this.

226
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,959
These plans could revolutionize
underwater breathing,

227
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,502
but I can't get the financing.

228
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,296
Excuse me, Pier.

229
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,089
- Hi Minou.
- Hello.

230
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,966
That gentleman
from financing is here.

231
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,552
He doesn't want to accept the extension
without talking to you personally.

232
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,472
- Tomorrow.
- OK.

233
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,724
Excuse me, darling.

234
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:21,646
I'll see you tonight.
We'll go out for dinner, just the two of us.

235
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,813
Alright.

236
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,649
- Bye.
- Bye.

237
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:27,068
- Giorgio, would you show her around?
- Sure.

238
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,969
Give me signorina Dominique.

239
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,597
Yes, I understand, Giorgio,
but...

240
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,975
I feel Pier's so nervous,
troubled...

241
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,936
You know, Minou,
this is a very difficult period for us.

242
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:04,313
I know.
Pier told me that already.

243
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:08,818
That if that poor Dubois hadn't died
so unexpectedly... bye bye company.

244
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,737
I shouldn't say this,
but his death was a true salvation.

245
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,364
Dubois was a real loan shark.

246
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,408
- Excuse me, would you sign this?
- One moment. Yes?

247
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,496
What's that in there?

248
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,166
The new compression chamber.
Go in.

249
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,752
They're testing the new mixtures.
I'll join you.

250
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,214
- And here.
- Yes.

251
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,888
- Good afternoon, signora.
- Hello.

252
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,281
- Where you at?
- 15.

253
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,657
Very good.

254
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,120
Inside there's 15 atmospheres of pressure.
Look.

255
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,252
It's as if this man
is at a depth of 150 m.

256
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,175
Your husband
doesn't cheat on you.

257
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,677
He's a murderer.

258
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,809
Before he can get out of there again...

259
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:27,563
...and back to normal pressure
without risking his life...

260
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,900
...he needs to make long stops
at various intermediate pressures.

261
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:33,778
- It's very time-consuming.
- And if he doesn't?

262
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,574
Then he would die from an embolism
after a few minutes.

263
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,385
I love you, Minou.

264
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,561
I love you too, Pier.

265
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,399
Why don't you confide in me?

266
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,611
You're so distant, preoccupied.

267
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,241
Believe me,
if anything happened to you...

268
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:23,828
Pier...
I'll always be with you.

269
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,754
- Listen...
- Yes?

270
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,466
I want to ask you something.

271
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,553
When you were at the beach...

272
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,062
Who could it be?
It's almost 2:00am.

273
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,898
- Well, I'll go see.
- Thank you.

274
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,620
- Hello?
- Minou, remember me?

275
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,583
Now you know
who your husband murdered.

276
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,795
You do know, don't you?
Or do you still have doubts?

277
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,965
If you don't leave me alone
I'll go to the police!

278
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,383
I wouldn't advise that.

279
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,219
Otherwise, I'd give the police
a listen to this recording.

280
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,349
We should take him
out of the compression chamber now.

281
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,185
He's turning blue.

282
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,770
Are you sure nobody will suspect anything?

283
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,106
Sure, it will look like an embolism.

284
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:37,234
He was old, it happens.

285
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,069
You'll see, it will pass
as a natural death.

286
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,415
Did you hear
your husband's voice?

287
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,418
Tomorrow you'll go to
the address I told you. Alone.

288
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,961
If not, I will report him.

289
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,840
You will enjoy it.

290
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,469
Bye, Dominique.
See you tomorrow, huh? Bye.

291
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,265
Dominique?
What did she want at this hour?

292
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,392
You know Dominique...

293
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,437
She was supposed to call at 11:00pm
but she only remembered it now.

294
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,065
It's hopeless, she will never change.

295
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,485
- I'm not tired anymore. How about a drink?
- Alright.

296
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,980
Tomorrow you'll go to
the address I told you. Alone.

297
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,148
If not, I will report him.

298
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,249
How much?

299
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,298
How much I want.
How much you're willing to give me.

300
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,437
We should take him
out of the compression chamber now.

301
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,315
This belonged to poor Dubois.

302
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,442
He used it to record
his business conversations.

303
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,068
Sure, it will look like an embolism.

304
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:33,447
He sure didn't think he would ever record
the voice of his own murderer.

305
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,911
Give me that recording.
I have 1,000 dollars for you.

306
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,586
How did you get it?

307
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,800
I was at the right place
at the right time.

308
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,177
Sit down.

309
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,971
Sit down!

310
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:31,588
You don't have any power over me.
You just have a few colored papers.

311
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,549
You didn't understand
anything, Minou.

312
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:37,761
I'm the master of your soul,
of your body.

313
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,306
You're insane.

314
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:48,355
I want what I like, and I will take it.
Life is for pleasure.

315
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,150
Your husband is not insane, but he killed
a man just because he owed him money.

316
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:56,446
You're not insane, but you came here
to protect a murderer.

317
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:02,411
You who are not insane
can only do abominable things.

318
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,246
And you do it to suffer.

319
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,082
I, however,
do it for pleasure.

320
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:11,670
Let me go!
And open that door now!

321
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,632
Alright, go if you want.

322
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,468
But your husband
will go to prison for life.

323
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:23,724
You'll see, it'll be much more pleasant
than you think.

324
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:30,230
Alright, I'm here.
Do whatever you want.

325
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:34,860
Come on, do it!
But afterwards, I want that recording!

326
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,070
So what?

327
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,908
Didn't you hear me?
I said, I'm ready!

328
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,329
No...
Not like that, Minou.

329
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,586
You have to beg me,
to plead for my touch,

330
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,464
to long to be mine, without shame.

331
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,759
Like a slave,
like a whore.

332
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,140
Take off your coat.

333
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,812
Take off your coat!

334
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:20,030
On your knees!

335
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,080
Get down.

336
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,964
Undress.

337
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,237
Giovanni, is my wife back?

338
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:05,534
No, no, it's not important.
Don't tell her I called.

339
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,789
Pier, what's wrong?

340
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,793
- I've never seen you like this.
- I'm tired, Giorgio.

341
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:19,840
So far I've held up, but I don't know
how long I can go on like this.

342
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,175
Come on,
we've survived worse times.

343
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,263
Skip it.
What were you looking at?

344
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,977
The Dubois file.

345
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:36,440
This morning, a letter arrived
from the lawyer of the estate.

346
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:38,358
They're just as tough
as the dead man.

347
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,360
That gives us until the end
of the month to pay.

348
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,988
We could ask to pay by installments.

349
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,407
They are the Dubois.

350
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:48,660
- Tell them we'll pay.
- As you wish.

351
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,624
Yes?

352
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,835
Ah, yes, I'll be right there.

353
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,297
- Giorgio, wait here.
- Yes.

354
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,461
It's yours, you earned it.

355
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:47,177
Today you've learned things
your husband could never teach you.

356
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,647
- Hello darling.
- Hello.

357
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,323
- What did you do today?
- I drove around with Dominique.

358
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:00,375
Hi Minou.

359
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,003
Hi Dominique.

360
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,965
See that I was right,
Pier?

361
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,427
I told you she would make up a story.
How are you, dear?

362
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,849
Minou and I have prepared you
a little surprise.

363
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:20,729
We had bad timing today but I don't think
we should tell him beforehand, right?

364
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,980
No, no.

365
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,193
And a bit of jealousy
is always a good thing.

366
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,863
- Signore?
- Excuse me. Yes?

367
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,950
- They sent this over from your office.
- Ah, good.

368
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,704
- Get me the telephone.
- Yes, signore.

369
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,166
- Thank you, Dominique.
- No problem.

370
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,085
But what did you do anyhow?

371
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,338
You look like you came
from the slaughterhouse.

372
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:51,635
- You know, what happened to me today...
- Tell me later.

373
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:55,555
Go dress yourself for dinner,
I'll take care of Pier.

374
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,140
Thanks.

375
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,292
Alright, go if you want,
but your husband will go to prison for life.

376
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,730
You have to beg me,
to plead for my touch...

377
00:42:49,651 --> 00:42:52,028
... to long to be mine,
without shame...

378
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,117
... without shame...

379
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,037
...like a slave...

380
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,919
...like a whore.

381
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,510
Undress.

382
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:52,297
And now... we'll uncork
this bottle of champagne.

383
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,717
As if it was your birthday, OK?

384
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,610
You're so funny!

385
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:07,932
No! No!

386
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,813
- No! No! No!
- Minou! Minou!

387
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,193
What's wrong, Minou?
What is it?

388
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,589
What happened, Minou?
What happened?

389
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:43,259
Nothing, Pier.
Nothing, nothing, nothing...

390
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,639
Don't leave me, Pier!
Don't you ever leave me. Please!

391
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,224
Don't leave me!

392
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,935
Don't leave me!

393
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:45,530
Madam is still resting.
I don't think I'm allowed to disturb her.

394
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:47,907
Give her this envelope.
We'll see if she gets up.

395
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,702
- No, I'll close it.
- Very well, signore.

396
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,232
I have all the negatives,
of course.

397
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,819
- It's my profession.
- Get out of this house!

398
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,991
You're my slave,
and you do as I say!

399
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:17,497
Unless you want me to send
these delightful photos to your husband.

400
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,209
Did you see the nice one
in which we're kissing?

401
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:26,089
You insane scumbag!
You're so filthy! A coward!

402
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:30,468
When my husband finds out
what you've done, he'll kill you!

403
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,304
It's hard for a husband
to be proud of his wife,

404
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:37,600
if she thinks he's a murderer and
consoles herself by going to bed with me.

405
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,313
How could you have possibly believed that
your husband could kill a man for money?

406
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:48,319
It was just a trick.
His voice imitated for the recorder.

407
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,074
I've never met Dubois.

408
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,037
- I made it all up.
- That's impossible!

409
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:01,040
This can't be true.

410
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,294
It's not true.

411
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,632
But why does it upset you
so much, my dear?

412
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:14,679
I'm telling you the truth.
You thought he was guilty, but he's not.

413
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,849
But you react this way?

414
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,018
Why did you do all this?

415
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,396
To have you.

416
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,185
Hello?

417
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,357
- Of course, dear, I'll wait for you.
- Who is it?

418
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,568
But no, come over now.
Bye.

419
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:57,865
It's Minou. She'd better not find you here.
Get dressed.

420
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,749
Exit by the service door.
I'll be waiting for you tonight.

421
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,501
- Bye.
- Bye.

422
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:16,259
- Dominique...
- What's wrong? What happened?

423
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,403
So that guy invented everything
just to get you in bed.

424
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,697
We have to admit that he earned it...

425
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:41,492
- Dominique, please...
- Sorry, dear.

426
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,081
You're burning up.

427
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,377
I can still feel his hands on my skin,
his wet mouth...

428
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,046
I washed myself a hundred times,
but I still feel dirty.

429
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,216
But you did it to save Pier
thinking he was guilty.

430
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,136
I don't know,
I don't know anymore, Dominique.

431
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,762
I believed that man,
you know?

432
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,348
I believed him right away
and went to bed with him.

433
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:07,226
- Please get me something to drink.
- Of course, my dear.

434
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:18,279
You probably think you subconsciously
wanted him? But no, Minou.

435
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:22,033
You had a more erotic adventure
than usual, and you enjoyed it.

436
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:26,662
I didn't enjoy it!
I did not enjoy it!

437
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,664
Come on, drink.

438
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,878
Listen, Minou,
there are two kinds of people,

439
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:39,216
those who need protection,
and those who give it.

440
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,637
I'm glad you came to me,
very much so.

441
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:47,350
I've always counted on Pier,
completely.

442
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:50,853
He's everything to me.
Husband, lover, father.

443
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,314
And all of a sudden,
everything changed.

444
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,399
I don't know what to do anymore.

445
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:02,323
We either convince that guy to drop it,
or we'll have to tell Pier.

446
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:05,868
No! I don't want Pier to know anything.

447
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:09,747
I already tried to offer him money.
He threw it in my face.

448
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,292
He's only interested
in his madness.

449
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,253
- How much did you offer him?
- 1,000 dollars.

450
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:19,632
- Is that all you have?
- I don't know.

451
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:23,511
If I sell all my jewels...
maybe 10,000 dollars.

452
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,763
OK,
I'll add another 10.

453
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,767
He's thrown 1,000 dollars in your face.
Let's see if he does the same with 20,000.

454
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:35,982
Everything has a price,
even madness.

455
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:53,916
Take it.

456
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,461
No... I just can't accept it.

457
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,797
Pier's business isn't going well.

458
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:01,716
I don't know
when I'll be able to pay you back.

459
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,927
I'm not making an investment.
Go ahead, take it.

460
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,722
Why are you doing this,
Dominique?

461
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:11,517
Did I ask you for anything?
Don't cause yourself any more problems.

462
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,103
Thank you.
Thank you, Dominique.

463
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:27,635
Come out.

464
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,596
Idiot!

465
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,891
You enjoyed it so much
that you came back, huh?

466
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,814
20,000 dollars.

467
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:43,526
Give me the negatives.
It's a nice sum, isn't it?

468
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,987
And I hope you will
leave me alone forever.

469
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:51,158
"Forever"... what a serious word.

470
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:00,209
Give me the negatives!

471
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:03,838
You offer me 20,000 dollars
for my defeat...

472
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:07,299
...because then
you can spit in my face.

473
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:15,057
Minou, if I had offered you 20,000 dollars
for your body, would you have come here?

474
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:19,145
- You're a dirty bastard!
- Would you have come here?

475
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,817
To kiss, to caress, to do everything?

476
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:27,236
Don't touch me! I hate you!

477
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,780
Would you come here
for 20,000 dollars?

478
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,408
No, certainly not.

479
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:37,746
So, how could you hope
to buy yourself free for 20,000 dollars?

480
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,292
You already got
what you wanted.

481
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:46,672
If you touch me one more time,
I will kill you first and denounce you later!

482
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,675
When you were lying under my body

483
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,387
you enjoyed it more
than ever before in your life.

484
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:58,726
Minou... you liked it so much
that you're now starting to pay me.

485
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:00,895
You're a son of a bitch!

486
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,147
Take your money and leave.

487
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,650
I'll give you three days
to think about it.

488
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:08,777
If you haven't come back by then,

489
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,988
your husband
will receive these photographs.

490
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:13,616
He will finally see
what you're able to do.

491
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:16,076
Three days!
Remember it, Minou!

492
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:19,205
- Three days!
- You pig!

493
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,519
Here, drink that.

494
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:12,026
And don't you get these ideas anymore.
If Pier loves you, he'll understand.

495
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:16,071
How could I have believed
that he killed Dubois?

496
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:19,908
Just like I believed that the blackmailer
would take the 20,000 dollars.

497
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:24,413
Of course he could have accepted it
and continued the extortion anyway.

498
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,666
I don't understand why he didn't.
It's puzzling.

499
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,503
This man is insane.
He doesn't think like others do!

500
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,756
Nobody can tell
what he's up to next.

501
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:37,301
He's not stupid
when he wants to lay a trap.

502
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:42,222
- Anyway, you need to tell Pier everything.
- How could I?

503
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:46,477
You're beautiful, Minou,
he'll love you despite all that.

504
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,773
Stay with me when I tell him.
I'm scared.

505
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,274
Alright.

506
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,110
It's better to tell him right away.
Tonight.

507
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,864
Call him at the office.

508
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:13,087
Stay calm, Pier, and listen to me.
Minou is right.

509
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:18,175
The death of Dubois, the recorder...
You know she's very impressionable.

510
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:22,179
However, she did everything she could
to get rid of that maniac.

511
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:27,393
After all, this situation of yours
could have actually happened.

512
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:28,769
No, it couldn't have!

513
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,562
The woman I love can't possibly think

514
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,565
that I'm capable of killing a man
just because I owed him some money!

515
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:35,776
I believed it up to the point,

516
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:39,238
when she slept with another guy
in order to destroy the proof!

517
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,906
Of course he's lying!

518
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:46,662
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving, Pier. You're right.

519
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:52,209
I love you, and I also loved you
when I thought you had killed a man.

520
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,129
- But I have ruined everything.
- Stop!

521
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,923
Don't go away.
Sit down.

522
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,521
From now on we'll do it my way.

523
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,155
Commissioner Poretti, please.

524
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,449
It was here.

525
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:01,487
This is illegal, but you will testify
that we found it open.

526
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:04,341
- Are you sure it was here?
- But yes! Of course it was here!

527
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:07,511
This place looks like
it was abandoned a century ago.

528
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:19,648
Take her home.
I'll make some inquiries.

529
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:23,610
See you tomorrow, signora.

530
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:30,117
- Pier... you don't believe me, do you?
- Yes, yes, I believe you...

531
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:34,663
Pier, look!
Right here, there was a huge bed!

532
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:39,876
And here, there was a devil,
a completely red one!

533
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:41,795
All red!

534
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:47,009
And here, there were
lots of small white hands,

535
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,385
all attached to this.

536
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:06,236
But... you could be mistaken.
It's all empty.

537
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,071
No!
Why don't you believe me, Pier?

538
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:11,491
I told you that there was a huge bed here,
and a red devil over there!

539
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:15,621
And here were these small white hands!
I swear it!

540
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:18,290
Yes, but sometimes
people have bad dreams.

541
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,835
Why don't you believe me?
Why won't you believe what I told you?

542
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,712
- OK, I believe you.
- But...

543
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,089
But now we're going home, huh?

544
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,106
Are you still needing those pills?

545
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:47,569
They are the only things
that keep me relaxed.

546
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,321
And they destroy your nerves.

547
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:55,160
It's also my fault.
I upset you with my business worries.

548
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:59,915
Pier, I wish it was all just a nightmare,
that I was crazy.

549
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,127
- You think that I am?
- Oh no, you're just a little tired.

550
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:05,879
You need some rest, that's all.

551
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,636
Maybe it was the wrong apartment,
or you got the wrong address.

552
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,013
It was there, I assure you!

553
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,892
I don't know why it looked so different,
but it was there.

554
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,978
Yes, alright.
Now let's go to sleep.

555
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:23,605
- Pier...
- Yes?

556
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,190
Do you still love me?

557
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,402
But of course.
This hasn't changed anything.

558
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:31,321
Thank you.
It's the only thing that really matters.

559
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:30,422
- Pier! Pier! There's someone here!
- What?

560
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:33,383
- Someone's in the house!
- Someone's in the house?

561
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:36,428
It doesn't work.
They cut the lights!

562
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:42,851
It was probably just a blackout.

563
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,813
But I heard some noises
and then the lights went out.

564
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:52,319
Alright, I'll have a look.

565
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,428
Come one, we'll make a tour
of the entire house.

566
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:22,933
- The noises came from the studio.
- So let's go into the studio.

567
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,025
- I'm scared, Pier.
- Give me your hand.

568
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:04,766
Look! Look, Pier!

569
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,731
Wait here.

570
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:00,196
- Don't I deserve a cognac after that fright?
- Of course, I'll get you one.

571
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:13,752
- Pier! Pier! Pier! Pier!
- What's wrong, Minou?

572
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,922
- Look! He's here!
- But where, who?

573
01:10:17,047 --> 01:10:18,840
- Now he's gone!
- He's gone?

574
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:22,010
- That man! He laughed!
- What are you saying?

575
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,470
- That man!
- But who?

576
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:25,847
- He was there, I swear it!
- Now stop it, Minou!

577
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:29,184
- Pier, I swear it!
- Stop it! Stop it!

578
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,478
Stop it, you're scaring me!

579
01:10:49,204 --> 01:10:50,872
Relax now.

580
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:55,085
- Excuse me.
- Alright.

581
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,837
Breathe in.

582
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,424
Deeply.

583
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:13,979
- Hi Franco.
- Hello Pier. How is your wife?

584
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:17,357
The doctor is with her.
Have you found anything?

585
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,317
Yes.

586
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:23,863
That apartment has been empty
for more than a year now.

587
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:25,949
I thought so.

588
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,076
No, thanks.

589
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:31,705
I'm terribly worried, Franco.

590
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,666
Last night she even saw that
mysterious stalker at the window.

591
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:39,337
- Excuse me.
- Ah yes, doctor, come in.

592
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,632
Franco, this is Dr. Thomas.
Commissioner Poretti.

593
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:43,800
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

594
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:46,011
I've given her some drops
to calm her down.

595
01:11:46,136 --> 01:11:48,722
She suffers from a serious form
of exhaustion.

596
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:50,849
I will have to hospitalize her
to examine her thoroughly

597
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:54,978
but, for now it's important
that she stops taking these pills.

598
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:56,521
Yes, I know, doctor.

599
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,357
I tried everything I could,
but without luck.

600
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:02,527
She needs a change of air.
A trip would do her good.

601
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,321
She would have to go alone,
or with a friend. I don't have time.

602
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:09,367
No way! Your wife needs you,
she needs to be near you.

603
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,785
Even if she has consciously
or unconsciously

604
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:13,872
invented this persecution story,
she did it because of you.

605
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,790
To attract your attention.

606
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:18,334
Perhaps you neglected her lately.

607
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,463
Yes, yes, that's true, but...

608
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,757
I have my business, my company.
At this moment...

609
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,467
Please stay with her.

610
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:28,970
In these cases, affection and love
have more power than any medicine.

611
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,640
I don't know...
I don't know anymore, Dominique.

612
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,227
I'm beginning to believe
that I'm going mad,

613
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,396
that I've invented everything.

614
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,608
Come on, don't let yourself go,
or you will wreck yourself.

615
01:12:41,733 --> 01:12:44,152
Listen, I'll come over
after I've finished work.

616
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,321
Yes, please.

617
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:53,369
- You need to talk to a friend.
- Yes.

618
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,664
- I'll be waiting for you.
- OK. Bye.

619
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,500
Bye.

620
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,467
Thank you, doctor.
I'll keep you informed.

621
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,344
Please, it's very important.

622
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:11,471
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

623
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,724
- Goodbye.
- See you. It was a pleasure.

624
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,103
Well, Pier,
there's nothing more I can do.

625
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,486
Hello?

626
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,197
It was a bad mistake
to get the police involved, very bad.

627
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,243
I told you, three days.

628
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:39,541
- Three days!
- Pier! Pier! Pier!

629
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:44,254
- Pier! Come quickly!
- Yes, just yell, Minou.

630
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,382
- I will kill you.
- Minou!

631
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:49,384
It's him! On the phone!

632
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:11,364
The time is 11:38am.

633
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,951
The time is 11:38am.

634
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:19,164
The time is 11:39am.

635
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:22,542
Why won't you believe me?
I swear it!

636
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:27,088
It was him who called!
He said he wanted to kill me!

637
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:32,302
Pier, I didn't call the time service!
Believe me, at least you!

638
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:34,929
I just don't understand it.

639
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:40,143
That man who's pursuing you, signora,
what type is he?

640
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:42,854
- What does he look like?
- What he looks like?

641
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:45,899
This is what he looks like!

642
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,862
I have a photo of him.

643
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:53,031
Here.

644
01:14:57,368 --> 01:15:00,330
But it was right here!
I'm sure it was!

645
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:04,209
I swear it, Pier, it was right here!

646
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,964
He took it!
Why is it gone? It was here!

647
01:15:10,632 --> 01:15:11,883
I put it there!

648
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:15,762
It was here!

649
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,223
Minou...

650
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,976
Dominique... call Dominique!

651
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:25,939
Call her! Call Dominique!

652
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:29,400
Yes, yes, you could say
"pornographic", Commissioner.

653
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,570
Everyone can look at what they want
in their own home, right?

654
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,698
- I think that's normal.
- Yes, yes, sure, but tell him!

655
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:39,118
You remember it. At your place,
when you gave me that picture.

656
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,914
Honestly, I don't remember.

657
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:48,336
- Are you quite sure, Minou?
- Dominique... but why?

658
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:53,341
Didn't you like
my little dirty collection?

659
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,929
I would remember if
she had asked me for a picture.

660
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,647
Commissioner,
would you give me a light?

661
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:12,735
Thanks.

662
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:16,823
- He's a murderer.
- A photographer.

663
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:20,326
- It's a gift.
- Undress.

664
01:16:21,327 --> 01:16:23,329
- Dominique!
- It's my profession.

665
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:25,498
- Take it.
- You pig!

666
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,878
You're welcome.

667
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:38,386
- Listen... we have to talk.
- Come with me.

668
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:15,965
These photos will never arrive, Minou.
They don't exist.

669
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,469
But they are my only hope, Pier.

670
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:24,015
They're the proof that I didn't dream it,
that I'm not crazy!

671
01:17:24,599 --> 01:17:27,393
It was only a nightmare,
a bad dream.

672
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:32,732
You've never been with another man.
Isn't it better to think that way?

673
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:35,151
Alright, Pier, I will prove it.

674
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:38,279
Meanwhile, I will take your other rook.

675
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:44,577
- Let's let it ring without answering it.
- No, it might be something important.

676
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:46,788
Yes?

677
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:49,999
No, Giorgio, you have to try
and arrange it alone.

678
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:53,294
- Pier, they're waiting for you.
- Who's waiting for who?

679
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:57,340
But Pier, you set up this
"appointment of salvation".

680
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:59,592
At the Derby Hotel, don't you remember?

681
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:04,097
We'll have dinner with these two financiers
who came by plane from Munich.

682
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:06,933
- What is it?
- Wait a minute.

683
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:08,935
An appointment with the guys from Munich.

684
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,812
I'm supposed to have dinner
with them tonight.

685
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:14,232
It's OK, Pier.
Go if you have to, I'll wait for you.

686
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,734
- You really don't mind?
- No.

687
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,324
- Alright, Giorgio, see you there.
- OK, bye.

688
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,057
- Hi
- Hi.

689
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,184
They're not here, yet.
I told them we'd meet them at the bar.

690
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:58,271
- Got the plans with you?
- You have the plans, Pier.

691
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:00,731
- I have?
- Yes, don't you remember?

692
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,108
I gave them to you yesterday.

693
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:04,443
- Yesterday? Are you sure?
- Yes.

694
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:09,949
Damn, you're right.
I left them at home.

695
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,159
Try to entertain them.
I'll be right back.

696
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:13,327
Alright.

697
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,582
- Please, be quick.
- Yes, yes.

698
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,716
- Excuse me, please.
- We've been waiting for 30 minutes!

699
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:28,634
Yes, yes, he'll be right back.

700
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,953
You see? Now it works.

701
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:08,581
Want to call your husband?

702
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:10,202
Pier!

703
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:14,081
Pier... you see?

704
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,792
I'm not crazy, he does exist!

705
01:28:18,085 --> 01:28:19,378
Stay right there.

706
01:28:20,379 --> 01:28:23,924
Of course he exists, I invented him.

707
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:28,595
I directed his every move,
every one of his words,

708
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:33,600
to drive you insane,
and to make you commit suicide.

709
01:28:34,768 --> 01:28:39,523
Unfortunately, this idiot continued
to play the sex maniac

710
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,984
and wasn't capable of killing you.

711
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:44,069
That's not possible!

712
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:47,573
It can't be true!

713
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:15,684
They will find a woman killed by a beast
and a beast killed by a loving husband.

714
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,230
Pier! Freeze!

715
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:35,537
One moment later,
and that maniac would have killed her.

716
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,541
Drop that weapon!

717
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:42,336
But Franco, I told you,
I came here when...

718
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:44,671
I said, "drop that weapon!"

719
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:49,051
You got it all wrong, Franco,
I told you that...

720
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,487
Madman...

721
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:12,407
Your call seemed incredible,
signora.

722
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:15,035
- Dominique!
- Minou!

723
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,123
Minou...

724
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:22,042
- Dominique!
- Oh, my poor dear.

725
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:32,719
Call the others to check the scene
and an ambulance.

726
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,311
- Minou! Minou!
- Signora...

727
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:48,610
- You remain at our disposal.
- Alright, Commissioner.

728
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:51,405
- Try to stay calm.
- Will you come with me?

729
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:53,031
- As soon as I'm finished.
- Bye.

730
01:30:53,157 --> 01:30:54,408
Bye.

731
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:58,078
- Is it serious, doctor?
- No, relax.

732
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:01,874
She lost a lot of blood, but one transfusion
will be enough. Good night.

733
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:07,296
Take one from that side.

734
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:21,393
You know him?

735
01:31:22,436 --> 01:31:23,812
Yes.

736
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,073
Take another one.

737
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,492
- Care for a whiskey?
- Double, if you please.

738
01:31:38,952 --> 01:31:40,787
I really need one.

739
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:48,212
- But how did you know what was happening?
- I didn't know.

740
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:52,132
In the beginning I didn't pay much attention
to Minou's strange change of behavior

741
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:54,134
and to her mysterious blackmailer.

742
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,011
Please leave! Out!

743
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:57,638
- Go, go!
- Please continue.

744
01:31:58,388 --> 01:32:01,225
I began to get suspicious
when Giorgio mentioned to me

745
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:04,519
that Pier had bulked up
Minou's life insurance

746
01:32:04,645 --> 01:32:06,396
with an enormous sum.

747
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:12,152
I knew Pier well, and for money
he would have even killed his own mother.

748
01:32:13,654 --> 01:32:16,865
Then, yesterday evening, after the story
with that photo, all doubts vanished.

749
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:20,619
- The story with that photo?
- That photo really existed.

750
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:25,749
It was Pier's only mistake
not to remember that he gave it to me

751
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,543
during one of our trips to Copenhagen.

752
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:31,505
There we met that man,

753
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:36,051
who apart from his photos
also sold his personal services.

754
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:39,888
- His what?
- Personal services.

755
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:44,726
And, to be quite honest,
not too shabby, Commissioner.

756
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:48,897
Commissioner,
a phone call for you.

757
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,067
Ah, thanks. Hello?

758
01:32:52,693 --> 01:32:54,736
- Excuse me, do you have a cigarette?
- Sure.

759
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:58,240
No, impossible right now.
I told you it's not possible!

760
01:32:58,365 --> 01:33:00,409
- Got a light?
- Yes, signora.

761
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:07,332
- I'll be at the station later on.
- Thank you.

762
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:09,459
Bye, bye. Here.

763
01:33:10,669 --> 01:33:13,505
- Please, go on.
- Ah, yes.

764
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:17,175
Only Minou, Pier and myself
knew of that photo.

765
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,262
And he was the only one
who could have wanted it to disappear.

766
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:23,932
After that, I just waited for
the right moment to call you.

767
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:25,642
A rather dangerous game.

768
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:29,438
If I hadn't done it like that,
nobody would have ever believed me.

769
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:33,275
Is that professional jealousy,
Commissioner?

770
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:40,282
Nevertheless, I don't know
how to thank you. You must be tired.

771
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:42,784
I'll have someone escort you.
Sergeant!

772
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:46,038
One last thing, Commissioner,
I'm sure you wouldn't mind.

773
01:33:46,163 --> 01:33:48,415
Instead of having me escorted
by the sergeant,

774
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,375
could I be escorted by him?

775
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,002
- If you wish.
- Yes.

776
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:53,211
Hey, you!

777
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:56,089
- Accompany the lady.
- Yes, sir.

778
01:33:56,214 --> 01:33:57,924
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

779
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:07,976
Out, out!
Out with the photographers!

780
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,948
- How are you feeling now?
- I've never felt better!

781
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:23,617
- I'll wait in the car.
- Alright.

782
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:27,496
The only thing I advise you
is to stay off those pills.

783
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,707
Yes, don't worry.
No pills, no whiskey.

784
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:32,084
Very good.

785
01:34:32,542 --> 01:34:34,294
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

786
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,837
Don't worry about the company.

787
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:40,300
With the money from Pier's
two life insurances, everything will be fine.

788
01:34:40,425 --> 01:34:43,470
Please, let's talk about it later.
I just want to rest now.

789
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:45,055
You're right, I'm sorry.

790
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:47,140
- Please.
- Bye.

791
01:34:47,265 --> 01:34:48,308
Bye, Minou.

792
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:50,060
Bye, Dominique!

793
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:52,104
What shall we do now?

794
01:34:52,229 --> 01:34:54,689
Listen, I have an idea.
Why don't we go to my place?

795
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:57,567
Some stuff from Copenhagen arrived
that I'd love to show you.

796
01:35:10,288 --> 01:35:16,169
THE END
