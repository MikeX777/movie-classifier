1
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:37,409
Cathy: It was a long
one today, I'll tell you that.

2
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,989
Mm.

3
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,405
There's cake in the break room.

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,019
Somebody's birthday,
I don't remember who.

5
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,579
It's just one of them
sheet cakes from kroger,

6
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,703
but, it's pretty good
for a grocery store cake.

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,591
You don't really look like
you eat cake, though, do you?

8
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,676
- I eat cake.
- Cathy: Mm.

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,798
You know, my mama always said,
"never trust a skinny woman.

10
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,471
While we're eating,
they're plotting."

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,386
Well, if you eat cake,
how do you stay so little?

12
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,105
You are skin and bones, girl.

13
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,517
Smoking?

14
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,613
Mm-mm, smoking
don't make you thin. I smoke.

15
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,118
You know, I never know
if someone being quiet

16
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,363
is a sign of ain't got
nothing to say,

17
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,866
or they ain't got
nothing going on up here.

18
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,203
You seem to have it
altogether, though.

19
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,798
- Money-wise, I mean.
- How do you know that?

20
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,543
'Cause you come in here
wearing some nice shoes.

21
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,545
I've seen you wearing
those candies.

22
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,137
Those aren't cheap.

23
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,386
Well.

24
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,761
Have a good shift, Mandy.

25
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,102
Hey, Cathy.

26
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,854
Yeah?

27
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,484
Go fuck yourself.

28
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,046
Mr. Kent: Oh, you're here.

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,415
Okay, I'm very dizzy, okay?

30
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,382
And I spoke to Karen,
she's not listening to me.

31
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,001
I need to talk to a doctor
right away.

32
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,719
What if I fall down
and break a hip?

33
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,179
What if I fall down
and I crack my head

34
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,767
- and get a staph infection?
- Did you check in at this desk?

35
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,600
Mr. Kent: Yes.

36
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,810
- Mr. Kent...
- Karen.

37
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:31,523
I told you we will call you
when we have a bed ready.

38
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,562
You need to sit down.

39
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,940
You know, it is hot in here,
so I'm gonna wait outside

40
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,735
until you're ready.
And it better not rain.

41
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,409
I don't like to be wet.

42
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,789
Karen: You starting now?

43
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:49,203
You should know,
you scheduled me.

44
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,874
- Oh, yes.
- I'm about to work a double.

45
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,210
Well, you may wanna
start with 202.

46
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,501
And you should probably go
and get a soda.

47
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,596
I don't drink soda.
Karen, you know that.

48
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,506
You got about 30 minutes.

49
00:03:55,485 --> 00:04:00,320
Chug it, chug it, chug.

50
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,007
This is good to go.

51
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:30,226
Can you believe our insides
look like this?

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,476
Like, that's our guts.

53
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,063
Seems to me like it would
all just come

54
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,022
bubbling out of us sometimes.

55
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:41,691
Like, "oops, my pancreas
just fell out."

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,071
Mandy: Regina.

57
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,571
- Regina: Hmm?
- Give me the money.

58
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,320
Okay, but first, uh...

59
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,745
Let me show you something.
This is what I like to do.

60
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:02,925
I like to use the soda
to keep 'em extra cold in here.

61
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:07,592
I always say, "keeping it cool
is the key to my job."

62
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,179
I made that up.

63
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,515
And then I can drink 'em
when I'm done,

64
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,725
like it's a celebration.

65
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:16,973
- I really don't care, Regina.
- Look, we're family, right?

66
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,850
I mean, how many cousins
your age you got?

67
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,068
- Cousins by marriage.
- Regina: Right.

68
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,983
And who knew we're into
the same stuff?

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,276
You know,
the blood and organs and...

70
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,408
We're not. The money, Regina.

71
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,620
Regina: 'Cause Nicholas needs
a kidney, like, right now.

72
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,580
But I got held up.

73
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,365
You know Wayne?

74
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,119
He... he needed help
with his science homework.

75
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,996
You know they teach
evolution in fifth grade now?

76
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,465
- In public school?
- Regina!

77
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,298
Ah. Sorry.

78
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,430
Now, was there a kidney,
in that sack?

79
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,673
Was there?

80
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,721
I know what a damn kidney
looks like.

81
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,140
Like a bean? Kidney bean?

82
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,232
Jesus. Grumpy ass bitch.

83
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,619
Boy: Hey, bitch!

84
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,463
Regina: Fuck your mom, asshole.

85
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,326
Are you my mother's nurse?

86
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,791
Was it you who told me that
she was possibly in a coma?

87
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,208
Were you here earlier?

88
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,249
I just got here.

89
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:04,544
Okay.

90
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,882
Any idea when the results
will be back from her tests?

91
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,877
The doctor won't be back
until tomorrow

92
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:14,552
- to go over test results.
- But are the test results here?

93
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,097
L... don't see them here, ma'am.

94
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,311
So am I just supposed
to stay here all night?

95
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,066
You don't have to.

96
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,404
I'm sorry.
It's just have a baby at home.

97
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,823
And I help run my...
My husband's business.

98
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:35,489
You know the... the catfish king
over on south grand?

99
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:35,861
Mm-hmm.

100
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,362
It's just I feel so guilty
not staying

101
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,660
in case she wakes up.
She might be confused.

102
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,000
She's got dementia
or Alzheimer's

103
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,868
or whatever they're calling it
these days.

104
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,962
If she doesn't know
where she is, she can be...

105
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,207
She can be real difficult
and she's...

106
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,583
She's very strong and...

107
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,427
Is that your mother's
overnight bag?

108
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,554
Some of her personal things.

109
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,924
I grabbed real quickly.

110
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:02,388
You know, I just love
that catfish king.

111
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,940
Mm! I love those hush puppies.

112
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,439
- Still pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,106
But don't you worry,

114
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,073
the good lord will be
with your mama all night.

115
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,907
Promise you that.

116
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,460
No.

117
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,395
Ain't no way you're waking up.

118
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,686
Janet: Room 218 needs cleaning.

119
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,313
Dorothy: I already cleaned it.

120
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,029
He pissed the bed.

121
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:58,027
He urinated a moment ago.
That's why I cleaned it.

122
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,654
Dorothy, clean the sheets.

123
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,588
- What is that about?
- State pen.

124
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,261
Tried to kill himself.
He'll make it, though.

125
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,348
Dorothy: Poor thing.

126
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,263
They gotta leave him
handcuffed to the bed

127
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,101
even though he's passed out?

128
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,063
He murdered someone.
Don't you read the paper?

129
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,900
She only reads the Bible.

130
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,485
And those good news bulletins
that folks leave

131
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,481
on your front porch
when you don't answer the door.

132
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,610
Okay.

133
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,326
Emergency dialysis.
67-year-old male.

134
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,117
Three times in a month.
That's you.

135
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:43,746
Mr. Collins?

136
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,038
Yep, but not critical,
so just prioritize.

137
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,164
Mr. Collins:
I don't like this room.

138
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,382
You hear me?

139
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,291
I said I don't like it.

140
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,171
You can leave when you're done
with your dialysis.

141
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,516
Sad sweat.
That's what it smells like.

142
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,225
You ever smelled sadness?

143
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,476
Only every day.

144
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,861
You know, they only gave me
three months.

145
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,278
Two and a half now, maybe.

146
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,995
I'm here half the damn time.
I do wanna go home, though.

147
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,448
You turn on that TV?

148
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,335
Sure.

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,922
Wendy: My husband likes a clean car,

150
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,539
what can I say?

151
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,416
Newscaster 1:
Well, you know what they say

152
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,590
about Arkansas, if you
don't like the weather,

153
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,378
just wait a minute.

154
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,051
Wendy: My grandma did always say that.

155
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,389
Newscaster 1: Mine foo.

156
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,509
Newscaster 1: Well, thanks for
the weather update, Wendy.

157
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,728
Let's get back to the real news
of this evening.

158
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,596
The local eighth grade
science fair.

159
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,939
Now, these kids show
some real aptitude.

160
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,435
Mr. Collins: You know...

161
00:10:55,446 --> 00:11:00,315
Sad thing about dying is that
the minutes really slow down.

162
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,863
You forgot to appreciate
all those other minutes

163
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:06,614
and all you got are these
shitty ones.

164
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,410
Hey, Mandy, they're bringing in
an od, and I'm too busy.

165
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,161
They could use some extra hands.

166
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,176
Shit.

167
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,183
Hey, male, 30s.
Od'd, no identification.

168
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,809
Found at a motel.
Heart rate is 38.

169
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,233
Respiratory rate, critical.
Administered narcan.

170
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,314
What?

171
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,817
- Nothing.
- Derrick: You know him?

172
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,068
Uh. Sort of.

173
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,320
Okay. He needs his whole
system flushed.

174
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:48,538
Okay.

175
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,078
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

176
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,792
Oh, shit, he's having a seizure.

177
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,337
Code blue,
someone get a line set up.

178
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,832
Oxygen's going down, code blue.

179
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,573
You're late.

180
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,502
But there's nothing I like
better than cash in my hand.

181
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:41,751
There's a few things I like
a lot more than cash in my hand.

182
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,714
Me too, actually.

183
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,761
Or maybe not.

184
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,057
202 is too tricky.

185
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:54,304
I have another idea.
Mr. Collins. Dialysis.

186
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,147
Just gotta keep
prying eyes away.

187
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,439
Well, look at you
taking initiative.

188
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,820
I like my initiative too.

189
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,486
Well, I guess I could have
your crazy ass cousin

190
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,199
do another pickup tomorrow.

191
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,741
That girl is not my cousin.

192
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,491
You better tell her that.

193
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,323
Regina, where the fuck
have you been?

194
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,364
Regina: Geez, Nick,
I told you I was running late.

195
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,579
I reckoned you guys
would be in here playing poker

196
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,289
- or whatever you do.
- Mikey: Nah, I already won.

197
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,205
Yeah, that shit ended hours ago.
You...

198
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,705
- Kept me waiting.
- Geez, sorry.

199
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,502
I came right here.

200
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,713
- Our cousin said...
- Our cousin?

201
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,759
No, no, you're my cousin.
She's your cousin.

202
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,848
And she's your cousin
by marriage.

203
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:40,141
Mm-hmm. And that makes her
your cousin too.

204
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,605
Regina,
that's not how family works.

205
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,815
Regina: What's happening to her?

206
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,060
Nicholas: She's getting her
belly button pierced.

207
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,652
Stop moving, it'll hurt less.

208
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,271
Uh. Mikey,
get her a drink, okay?

209
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,739
It don't look like
she likes it much.

210
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,779
And how is that any
of your fucking business?

211
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,366
Mandy said one of those things
is a kidney.

212
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,659
"One of those things"?
You don't recognize a kidney?

213
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,875
Telling you, public school here
is a lot of...

214
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,871
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh.

215
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,919
I use those to keep it
a little bit cooler.

216
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,174
You know, I always say,

217
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,544
"part of my job
is to keep things cool."

218
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,297
That's sweet,
but where are my fucking organs?

219
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,048
Uh. Under the drinks.

220
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,596
Nicholas:
No, no, there's nothing here.

221
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,479
- Is this a fucking joke?
- Regina: No, no joke.

222
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,600
Uh. I... I don't know.
Let me check my car.

223
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,852
Regina, I...
I realize you're new here.

224
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,774
You've been with us,
what, a couple of weeks?

225
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,896
- A month.
- Nicholas: Okay.

226
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,445
But your sole purpose
is to bring me

227
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,817
the fucking organs.

228
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,972
I'm sure I left them in my car.

229
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,033
I need the fucking organs
right fucking now!

230
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,874
I've got a guy who needs
an organ tonight.

231
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,584
An important guy,
more important than...

232
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,919
Than my cousin.

233
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:47,628
You had one job to do

234
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,465
and that was to bring me
the kidney from the hospital.

235
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,335
It's really...
It's really very simple.

236
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:53,716
I know.

237
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,461
Nicholas:
This is an emergency, Regina.

238
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,634
(Woman yelpin - shut op! 9

239
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,304
- I... I'll check my car.
- You do that.

240
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,644
And if it ain't out there,
I can think of another place

241
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,606
where we can find ourselves
a kidney.

242
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,234
Maybe that's
what you're good for.

243
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,822
- Parts.
- I... I'll check my car.

244
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,998
- Somebody get this.
- Somebody come get this.

245
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,877
Shit. Shit.

246
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,446
It's at the hospital.
I'll be right back.

247
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,656
It takes 30 minutes
to get there.

248
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,245
She's not back in an hour,
drag her back by the hair.

249
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,622
Can do.

250
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,717
Hey, will you turn it up?
I wanna know if it's gonna rain.

251
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,136
You deaf?

252
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,982
You know, it's Karen's birthday
next week.

253
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,226
You gonna pitch in for flowers?

254
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,602
We're all chipping
in three bucks.

255
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:38,072
- Probably not.
- Everybody's doing it.

256
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,864
When are you done
with your probation?

257
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,491
Bite me.

258
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,913
Hey, EMT Derrick said you knew
that trash od downstairs.

259
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,535
Who is he?

260
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,173
Bitch.

261
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,260
Wendy: Hoppity the bunny
is what his name is,

262
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,756
and that beanie baby sold
for over 500 dollars

263
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,473
right here in town.

264
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,092
Newscaster 1. Wow, better
stock up on those.

265
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,560
Our top story this evening
is the police force

266
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,304
y2k preparation convention.

267
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,682
Looks like our whole force
is out there.

268
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,478
That and then some.

269
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,353
Tonight began the first night
of a three...

270
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:24,202
Don't tell the next shift yet.
Maybe not Mr. Collins.

271
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:28,039
I like him.
I wanna think of someone else.

272
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:32,331
- What about that prisoner?
- He has a guard.

273
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,537
I ain't scared of that.

274
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,799
Well, he is gonna get the chair.

275
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,675
I guess that could work.

276
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,513
- It your birthday next week?
- Yeah.

277
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,136
They getting me
some flowers or some shit?

278
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,184
- Yeah.
- That's depressing.

279
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,145
Okay.

280
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,126
- Ma'am.
- Just checking in.

281
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,127
- You here all night?
- Uh. Unfortunately so, ma'am.

282
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,476
Mandy: How's he doing?

283
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,687
- You're the expert.
- Mandy: Hmm.

284
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,311
Do you need anything?

285
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:40,691
- I could use a coffee.
- You know, I'm not allowed

286
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:41,938
to do that for you.

287
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,066
But I could watch him
for a while if you wanna go

288
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:45,941
grab one. Go on.

289
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,069
They don't... they don't want me
to leave his side.

290
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,323
Oh, he is not going anywhere.

291
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,620
Yeah.

292
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,415
Thanks, but, rules are rules.

293
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,588
Get me some goddamn drugs.

294
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,477
I'll see if I can get you
that coffee.

295
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:29,361
Mandy: How you feeling today?

296
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,670
- Did you find that coffee?
- Nope.

297
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,595
We made a mistake.

298
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,225
What the fuck
are you doing here?

299
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:01,476
- Regina: Whoa, is that Andrew?
- Mandy: What mistake?

300
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,184
He od?

301
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,902
What's it about this family
that makes you guys

302
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:08,650
all into junkies, huh?
Must be your daddy or something.

303
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,409
Is Andrew gonna die?

304
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,281
- I never liked...
- There is a reason

305
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,831
we meet down
by the soda machine, Regina.

306
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,703
You can't be seen here.

307
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,295
I didn't want
to come in here, okay?

308
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,003
You know, surrounded
by all these dying people.

309
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,128
This is how you get one of those
flesh-eating bacteria diseases

310
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:29,798
like they got on TV.

311
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,844
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, you think it's an itch?

312
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,138
And...
And then you scratch it...

313
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,807
And your whole face
comes right off.

314
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:40,022
And it always begins
in a hospital.

315
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,109
- Why are you here?
- We fucked up.

316
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,153
- Mandy: Shit.
- Told you that it wasn't here.

317
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,068
Mandy:
Well, where the hell is it?

318
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,282
I don't know.

319
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,322
I don't know,
I... I don't know. I... I...

320
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,865
Maybe you lost it
on the way there.

321
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,081
I didn't touch the cooler
between here and the warehouse.

322
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,575
I checked my car.
I checked everywhere.

323
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:04,297
Look, if it's not here,
there is nothing I can do.

324
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,882
- We are laying low.
- Look...

325
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:07,799
I'm a little bit desperate here.

326
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,466
Nicholas is gonna have my ass
if I don't bring him a kidney.

327
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,965
Maybe more than my ass. He...
He is gonna take my kidney.

328
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:18,765
He said so. How many...
How many do I need to live?

329
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,684
- One.
- How many was I born with?

330
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,684
- Two.
- That's not too bad.

331
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,526
Look... mm-mm.

332
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,690
I don't wanna point
fingers at you.

333
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:34,159
It's your job to make sure
I get the package securely.

334
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,701
And apparently, I didn't.
Just help me out.

335
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,163
Regina.

336
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,703
Regina:
Why, just explain it to me.

337
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,044
- How do you murder people?
- Mandy: I don't murder them.

338
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,084
It's killing someone.

339
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,298
That's murder,
whatever you do to them.

340
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,714
I don't know what you do,
but how... how do you do it?

341
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:54,464
- Mandy, just tell me. Come on.
- Bleach.

342
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,764
- I use bleach.
- Hmm. And then you wait?

343
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,889
Someone else does the removals
on the next shift.

344
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,015
I don't even know who.

345
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,688
Maybe you know
how to do it right.

346
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,858
You went to school, you know...
You know what thing sits where,

347
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,823
- whatever it sits in there.
- Yes, I know how to do it.

348
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,693
So you could do it all,
you could do it real fast.

349
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:20,539
- Like, all in one night.
- No. It's too hard.

350
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,000
- Uh-huh.
- Mandy, help me, please?

351
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:24,993
I'm fucked.

352
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:29,169
Regina, you lost thousands
of dollars worth of organs.

353
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,589
- What about Andrew?
- What about Andrew?

354
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,555
Regina: I mean, is he gonna
make it outta here alive?

355
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,423
- Yeah.
- Regina: Really?

356
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,221
He didn't look too good.

357
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,263
You never really liked him,
right?

358
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,643
I... I know he's family too,
but...

359
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,857
Not like you and me.

360
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,445
I never did like him

361
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,528
when it all came out
that he did that...

362
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,949
That awful stuff
to you when you was kids...

363
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,366
Shut it.

364
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:05,459
Don't you dare go in that room.
Get the fuck out of here.

365
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,369
Do you understand me?

366
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,004
You are gonna have to solve
this problem by yourself.

367
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,923
Yes.

368
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,046
Mandy?

369
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:21,266
Is it 'cause I said
all that stuff, about Andrew...

370
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,932
About your fucked up childhood?

371
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:15,855
Well, look at you.

372
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,949
Mm-hmm.

373
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,574
How dead are you?

374
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,926
Wendy over TV: This is
Wendy with the weather.

375
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,725
That big storm looks like
it's coming in tonight.

376
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,144
Straight from the north
and hitting us right here

377
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,520
in northeast Arkansas, and
it is gonna be a wet one.

378
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,772
Tune in here for flash flood warnings.

379
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,488
Remember the basics.

380
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,529
- Close the windows to your car?
- Mandy: Why?

381
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,535
It's gonna rain.

382
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,534
I don't leave the windows
to my car open.

383
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,157
Karen: Then they're closed.

384
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,580
Wendy over TV: High humidity of 87 today.

385
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,953
Karen:
Get that package out all right?

386
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,414
Yep.

387
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,675
Karen: And the other?

388
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,044
Mandy: I'll keep you updated.

389
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,513
Wendy over TV: Next week, we
got another hot one for you.

390
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:27,226
- This is a nasty ass cake.
- Yeah.

391
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,969
They always get...

392
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,600
Gross cake.

393
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,686
Wendy over TV: Stay tuned
next for American life.

394
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,658
Oh.

395
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,451
Thank you.

396
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,833
Guess I fell asleep.

397
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,542
Mandy: It's easy to get
tired on these night shifts.

398
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,884
Mm.

399
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:10,303
- You, uh, work for the prison?
- Nah, I'm just hired security.

400
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,100
They don't even give me a gun.

401
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,273
I mean, not that...

402
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,359
Not that I need one.

403
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,281
I do parties.

404
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:27,361
And nightclubs too.
And sometimes, I do the...

405
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,205
Do the show circuit,
the stadium shows.

406
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,200
I just did a Marilyn manson...

407
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,996
Show. Do you like them?

408
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:38,088
- Mm. No.
- No, yeah. Just a bunch of...

409
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,461
Long-haired
vampire-looking kids,

410
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,005
but it was... it was cool.

411
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,175
Yeah, that guitarist used to be
on the wonder years.

412
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,592
Yeah, he got one of his ribs
taken out

413
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,889
so he could suck his own dick.
Yeah.

414
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,890
Uh...

415
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,233
Hey.

416
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,695
- Hi!
- You here for his blood work?

417
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,695
Uh-huh, yep, mm-hmm.

418
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,405
He's probably gonna be
a vegetable.

419
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,070
It's a waste, he's pretty cute.

420
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,694
Maybe he's an asshole
in real life.

421
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,362
Cute ones always are.

422
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,616
Excuse me.
Could you direct me to room 2227?

423
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,242
I keep getting lost.

424
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,711
I'm busy.

425
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:23,459
- It's just around the corner.
- Well, I can't seem to find it.

426
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,631
Then I guess...

427
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,588
I'll show you.

428
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,423
You will.

429
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:39,350
Just keep going.
It's on this floor.

430
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,733
- You are not very helpful.
- I'm busy, can't you see that?

431
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,822
Well, I need to know
where I'm going...

432
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,163
I'm like the other nurse.
You know, I'm also busy.

433
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,030
This is my patient.

434
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:59,503
Mrs. Eliza Patrick.
And Mrs. Patrick needs me.

435
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,586
Who is your supervisor?

436
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,751
I'm sorry, I don't have time
to talk to you.

437
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,669
Who is your supervisor?

438
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,838
I want to tell them about
your poor customer service.

439
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,383
You're the one
who can't find her way around

440
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,971
one story of a building.

441
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,512
I'm gonna tell
everyone about that.

442
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,849
Are you my nurse?

443
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,267
- Yes, ma'am, I am.
- I need to get up for a bit.

444
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,016
Nah. I think that's a bad idea.

445
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,107
Mr. Collins: Nurse!

446
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:24,569
- Can I get a nurse in here?
- Woman: Where are you going?

447
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,608
To help this screaming man.

448
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,072
- Mr. Collins: Nurse?
- What is your name?

449
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,316
Mandy.

450
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,160
Well, I'm gonna report you,
Mandy!

451
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,500
Mr. Collins:
I think I must be done.

452
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:43,793
- Been here for over two hours.
- Probably so, then.

453
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,923
What's happening to you in here?

454
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,136
What?

455
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,136
Dialysis.

456
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:58,183
- Are you a nurse or what?
- Obviously.

457
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,935
Look at my outfit.

458
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,807
Mr. Collins:
Could you turn that TV up?

459
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,647
Can't hear anything.

460
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,947
What happened?

461
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,239
Man: She tried to stand.
I saw her from the hallway.

462
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,782
Mandy:
I didn't think she'd wake up.

463
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,827
- She's stronger than she looks.
- Mandy: Mrs. Patrick?

464
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,332
Your daughter just stepped out.

465
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,998
We need to get you
back in the bed, okay?

466
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:22,539
Where is she?

467
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,131
Call her daughter, please,
and tell her she's awake.

468
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,549
Come on now.

469
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,052
- Mandy: That's right.
- Up we go.

470
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,725
Where is shawna?

471
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:42,223
Mrs. Patrick. Eliza.
Listen to me, okay?

472
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,475
We're here to take care of you.

473
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,194
- Stay here a minute, will you?
- Okay.

474
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:08,123
Mandy: Shit.

475
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,051
What the fuck?

476
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,718
- Mandy: It's bleach.
- Dorothy: Oh, my sweet Jesus.

477
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,340
Did you say bleach?

478
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,094
- Dorothy: Mr. Collins?
- Mandy: He's gone.

479
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,893
Dorothy: Oh, no! Oh!

480
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,185
Karen:
What the fuck happened to him?

481
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,184
- I don't know.
- Have you lost your damn mind?

482
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,275
I can't cover
something like this.

483
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,192
- No. Dammit. It wasn't me.
- You sure?

484
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,405
Yes.

485
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,401
- Somebody call the cops?
- Yep.

486
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,777
Damn!

487
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,700
- You going home?
- They told me to wait

488
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,372
and give a statement.

489
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:48,797
- We are fucked.
- I know, Karen.

490
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,507
This is gonna set us way back.

491
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,129
We can't do anything
for weeks now.

492
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,258
Do you think I don't fucking
know that, Karen? Damn.

493
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,601
Well, if you didn't do it,
who did?

494
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,892
You know,
he was really depressed.

495
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,936
Ain't nobody drinking bleach,
Mandy.

496
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:11,733
Then I don't know.

497
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,443
Is there any more cake?

498
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,950
- What?
- Oh, my god.

499
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,786
Wha...

500
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,489
Oh, good.

501
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,543
Oh, goddammit. What the fuck
are you doing here?

502
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,886
Why are you wearing that?

503
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,175
This is not funny, Regina.

504
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,048
You need to get
the fuck outta here.

505
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,800
We just had an a...

506
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,602
What did you do?

507
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:53,813
- Uh... well, I was...
- What the hell did you do?

508
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,815
Nothing,
I was just helping you out.

509
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,488
Did you pour bleach
down that man's throat?

510
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,873
Yeah.

511
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,417
I just did what you do.

512
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,083
- That is not what I do.
- Hmm?

513
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:15,383
Why, I need that man's kidney.
I need it tonight.

514
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,469
Just give it to me
and I'll leave.

515
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,508
I'll go, you won't ever see
me again.

516
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:21,131
Oh, my god.

517
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,389
You're so stupid.

518
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,224
You are such a stupid bitch.

519
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:31,934
Excuse me?

520
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,896
- Fuck you.
- You are so dumb.

521
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,316
Do you know what dialysis is?

522
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,033
Mr. Collins was on dialysis

523
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,161
because his kidneys
are so shitty

524
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,825
he can't flush out
his own system.

525
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:48,325
So even if I was stupid enough
to help you,

526
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,577
that man's kidneys are useless.

527
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,252
You killed an innocent man
for no reason.

528
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,215
Do you understand that?

529
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,425
I'm not leaving
till you give me a kidney.

530
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,014
You are gonna leave.

531
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,475
And you are gonna leave
right now.

532
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:09,062
The cops are coming here.
And when they get here,

533
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,478
I'm gonna tell them
who did this shit,

534
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,225
the girl posing as a nurse

535
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,775
standing in the storage room
like an idiot.

536
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,902
You wouldn't turn on me
like that.

537
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,696
You brought me
into this whole thing.

538
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,195
Oh, like hell I wouldn't.

539
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,073
Then I'll tell them everything.

540
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,917
All the bad stuff about you...

541
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,454
About your little operation.

542
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,957
Hell, about all the drugs
you do in here.

543
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:43,130
If I leave here
without a kidney...

544
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,098
I'm dead.

545
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,990
What happened to this guy?

546
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,829
Alcohol and morphine.

547
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,499
- Is he dead?
- Mandy: No.

548
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,622
Whoa.

549
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,292
Is this, like, a prisoner
or something?

550
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,414
Mm, he's perfect.

551
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,632
Just bleach him
and take his kidney.

552
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:23,220
Probably deserves it.
What did he do?

553
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,970
Haven't you heard?

554
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,259
Murder. I murdered a cop.

555
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,100
I hate cops...

556
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,187
But I love blondes.

557
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,401
- We didn't know you were awake.
- Jefferson: Come on.

558
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:43,274
Take one of my kidneys,
and I'll take one of yours.

559
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,319
Mandy: Fuck.

560
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,067
Hey, you ever do it
on someone who's awake?

561
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,115
I... I mean,
he could still work.

562
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,409
No, stop trying to help.

563
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,828
Give me an hour, wait outside.

564
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,373
Okay, fine,
but we have to hurry.

565
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,745
An hour.

566
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,519
Lucky you got family checks
on you.

567
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:43,334
I could've used this tonight.
Hope you enjoy it.

568
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,349
Mandy, you're next.
He needs a statement.

569
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,102
- I was just, uh...
- Mandy, wait right there.

570
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:02,818
It'll just be a minute.

571
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,234
Ma'am, would you mind
closing the door?

572
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,822
Okay. Sit.

573
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,570
Hour's up.

574
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,836
Fuck you.

575
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,352
Mikey. Shit.

576
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,064
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

577
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:51,193
No one else in the unit
at the time that you know of?

578
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:51,863
- No.
- No, sir.

579
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:57,286
Nothing strange to report
when you saw Mr. Collins last?

580
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,825
- Nope.
- No, sir.

581
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,954
Although he was always
a bit surly.

582
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,921
We'll notify the family.

583
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,508
His poor family.

584
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,632
They were never around.

585
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,220
Well, it doesn't make it right.

586
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,465
No, ma'am, it does not.

587
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,600
Have a good night, officer.

588
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,469
Uh, no, I'm staying
here till morning,

589
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,813
just to make sure
you ladies are safe.

590
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,648
Just gotta take care
of you ladies.

591
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:24,813
I wanna keep an eye on things.

592
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,313
Make sure that
no bad guys get in.

593
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,905
Yeah, we got another officer
coming by to ask

594
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:33,151
y'all some questions later.
He's like a detective, you know?

595
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,528
I'm just sorta night shift.

596
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,532
You know, I... I think y'all
got nothing to worry about.

597
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,578
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary

598
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:43,454
- type situation.
- Well, you can say that again.

599
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,250
It was just
an out-of-the-ordinary

600
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,668
type situation.

601
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,836
Oh.

602
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,428
I get it.

603
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:59,143
But I'll be here, all night.

604
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,933
You two will be safe.

605
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,104
- Are we done here?
- Yes, ma'am.

606
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,567
That's all my questions.

607
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,903
I got a lot of patients
to get to.

608
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,197
Mr. Kent:
Karen, Karen, Karen, Karen.

609
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,536
Are you sure you don't have
a room for me?

610
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,747
- Karen: Mr. Kent.
- Hmm?

611
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,083
We have to get to
the priority problems first.

612
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,622
I mean, look at you.
You're walking around,

613
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,586
you're standing up. I...
I don't know even know

614
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,581
- what's wrong with you.
- I'm dizzy.

615
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:31,050
You don't need a room.

616
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,796
- Mandy: Hey.
- Karen: Hey.

617
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,478
- You get interviewed?
- By that cute cop?

618
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,019
- Mandy: Yeah.
- Karen: He funny, ain't he?

619
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,564
I like 'em funny, and rich.

620
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:50,319
But he ain't rich.

621
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,366
Mr. Kent.
Go sit down and wait your turn.

622
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,156
You are nosy as hell.

623
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,162
It's too stuffy in here, so.

624
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,242
Someone expired in the icu.
The coroner just left.

625
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:08,121
And the body is in the morgue
waiting to be transferred.

626
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,373
But I thought we agreed.

627
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,919
Extenuating circumstances.
I'll explain later.

628
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,216
Well, damn, bitch,
you could've warned me.

629
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,840
You know, I got a bad heart,
I can't take this shit.

630
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,966
Trust me.

631
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,970
Trust you about as far
as I can throw you.

632
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,145
Mr. Kent.

633
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,353
Mr. Kent?

634
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,439
We have a room for you.

635
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,489
Where the hell did he go?

636
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,160
Shit.

637
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,056
Regina: Shit.

638
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,408
Shit.

639
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:15,124
Hey. Isn't it a little late
for you to be out here skating?

640
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,571
Amen.

641
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:54,041
J have you been to Jesus j

642
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,506

643
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:04,882

653
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,261
Freeze, motherfucker!

654
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:34,763
Oh. Sorry. Heard a noise.

655
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,687
- Uh. It was me.
- Yeah.

656
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,729
What happened?

657
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,367
Man, y'all sure do get dirty,
huh?

658
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,410
I could not do that.

659
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,578
You want some help
with this guy?

660
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:57,418
Uh...

661
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,209
Sure.

662
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,206
Stephen: Sorry, I'm trying
to be a gentleman and all.

663
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,043
One, two.

664
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:12,349
You guys probably get a lot
of back issues, huh?

665
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,226
Some people do.

666
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,596
You look like you work in a...

667
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,015
Butcher shop.

668
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,189
Stephen: Hey, you want a soda?

669
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,938
I just got an extra one
from the machine.

670
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,616
I'm good.

671
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,736
No offense, uh,
this room is real creepy.

672
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:36,032
- And smells, so.
- Uh. Yeah.

673
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,750
Totally.

674
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,666
Wow.

675
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,635
Oh, sorry.

676
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,091
Probably not allowed
to touch that, huh?

677
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,889
- Yeah. Better not.
- I mean, oh, okay.

678
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,011
Just trying to be,
make a joke, you know?

679
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,480
It's pretty disgusting.

680
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,849
Not that I'm not used
to seeing...

681
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,025
Disgusting things. I mean, I...

682
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,895
I really am.
You'd be surprised what happens.

683
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,364
This one guy, he, um,
yeah, I mean, he, uh...

684
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,364
Guess I don't really have
any stories.

685
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,613
You know, just stuff happens,
you know? Yeah.

686
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,810
It's kinda like, you
know, like cops,

687
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,543
- if you've ever seen that show.
- You know...

688
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,873
- I think I will take that soda.
- All right.

689
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:33,135
I'm so glad you're here,
to take care of us...

690
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,387
To make sure we're safe.

691
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,645
Just doing my job.

692
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,479
I'll let you get back to yours.

693
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,900
Mm-hmm. Bye.

694
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,433
Shit.

695
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,476
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Mandy: Dorothy?

696
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,149
Mandy?
I gotta go get that cute cop

697
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:33,024
'cause I swear to god, there's
a dead body over there!

698
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,527
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
There's another one.

699
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,872
- A dead body, can you hear me?
- Where?

700
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,327
- Dorothy: Huh?
- Where?

701
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,121
Over by the storage shed!

702
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,898
I don't know what I was...
I just went out there,

703
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,254
just looking for somewhere
outta the rain to smoke.

704
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,169
Oh, god, I shouldn't even
be smoking!

705
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,337
And then...
And then there was a dead body!

706
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,677
Do you know what that means?
Mandy!

707
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,672
There is a murderer
loose in the hospital.

708
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,846
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, we're gonna die.

709
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:04,064
- We're gonna die. Oh, god.
- Oh, god.

710
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,487
- So, are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a nurse.

711
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,456
Now go sit down.
I'll be with you in a minute.

712
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,547
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, no kidding.

713
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,212
Mikey: Y'all found
someone to help me yet?

714
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,043
Nope.

715
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,382
Mikey: Just let me know
when you do.

716
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,804
Y'all... y'all stay safe.

717
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,518
- Okay.
- What the hell?

718
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,559
I guess we have multiple
problems.

719
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,311
I need your help.

720
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,692
Mandy, what did you get into?

721
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,779
I'm just gonna apologize
in advance.

722
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,902
Karen: Wait, so this bitch
might be wearing scrubs?

723
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,780
She might be snorting up all
the valium in the building,

724
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,951
for all I know.
She's fucking nuts.

725
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,866
I don't like it when
people call women nuts.

726
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,960
It's just an excuse
to belittle their problems.

727
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,670
And mental health
is nothing to belittle.

728
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,881
This bitch is actually nuts.

729
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,967
Say what you want,
doesn't mean I like it.

730
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,632
- Excuse me, ladies?
- Not now, all right?

731
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,049
Fine.

732
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,172
Karen: So, what's your plan here?

733
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,300
Mandy: Find this crazy bitchand
get her the fuck outta here

734
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,142
before she tells on both of us.

735
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,761
Karen: You're sure this was her?

736
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:26,512
Mandy: Yeah, I'm sure.

737
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,560
Karen: Why would you bring
this cousin of yours into this

738
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,604
if you knew she would kill
people and rat us both out?

739
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:35,025
I sometimes have
too much faith in humanity.

740
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,823
That is what I like about you.

741
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,410
But just so you know, if either
of you get me in trouble,

742
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,204
I will ask god
to strike you both down,

743
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,998
'cause he listens to me.

744
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,092
Shit.

745
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:08,809
Regina: Come on.

746
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:12,816
- Ah, shit.
- We're going on a walk.

747
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,434
All right.

748
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,686
Karen: Hey, Dr. Wilder.

749
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,619
Y'all look mad.

750
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,042
Damn, bitch, where's your shoes?

751
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,660
That guy pooped on them
when he died.

752
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,458
Oh, lord, you're right,
she is a murderer.

753
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,706
Regina:
Y'all are murderers first.

754
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:40,799
- Look, I... I can explain.
- Mm-hmm.

755
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:41,845
Yeah.

756
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,010
- Are those your panties?
- Yeah.

757
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,384
It's all I had to put
the kidney in.

758
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,510
And I didn't hear from you

759
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,977
and...
And it had been over an hour...

760
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,563
I was caught up
in the mess you created.

761
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,727
Well, I was all alone...

762
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,818
And then Mikey came and there
was a cop waiting around...

763
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,858
- Did they see you?
- No, never, I was just hiding.

764
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:00,527
And then that kid came,
so I went over there

765
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,399
- and I just... I...
- Got it.

766
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,402
Stop. You need to get
the fuck outta here.

767
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,654
Those cops are gonna be
looking for you

768
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,745
or anybody that did this shit.

769
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,867
And there's some creep outside
waiting to rip your tits off.

770
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,745
Well, it's fine now
'cause I have a kidney.

771
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,418
Now I can see Mikey.
He won't rip my tits off.

772
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,167
- That ain't no kidney.
- What isn't?

773
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:22,045
That is not a kidney.
That's a bladder.

774
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,012
- Oh, lord Jesus.
- But how do you know that?

775
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:26,723
I don't know if my heart
can take this right now.

776
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,433
I saw where you opened
that kid up.

777
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:29,597
You didn't even go in the back.

778
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,312
No, my... my...
My kidneys are right here.

779
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,682
Those are your ovaries.

780
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,605
That is a bladder.
Damn, you're nuts!

781
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,070
Maybe you should think
about this shit

782
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,814
before you go murdering someone.

783
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,825
I hate you.

784
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,618
Shit. They're coming for me.

785
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,616
It's just the storm.

786
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,830
Stephen over radio:
Ladies and gentlemen,

787
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:53,246
I have to inform you that we
are in a lock down situation.

788
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,211
Karen:
Oh, that is not necessary.

789
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:59,423
Stephen over radio: Do not exit
or enter the building.

790
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,627
Shit, I gotta get
the fuck outta here.

791
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,594
I just, I'm gonna go run.

792
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,306
- I'm just gonna run outta here.
- Stop.

793
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,726
I got you a kidney,
like I said I would.

794
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,594
It's down by the soda machine.

795
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,690
Go down there, get it,
and get the fuck outta here.

796
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,401
But there's cops outside.

797
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,519
Karen will walk you out.

798
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:21,611
- Mm-mm.
- And I'll distract the cops.

799
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,106
L... I'm not going anywhere
with that murderer, no.

800
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:24,948
I'm pulling rank.

801
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,238
All right, all right,
all right, fine.

802
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,741
I will walk you out.

803
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,281
Will you kindly...

804
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,328
Distract the cops?

805
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,372
Just get them
to the waiting room

806
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,211
and we'll sneak out the back.

807
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,671
Fuck, can't believe I'm taking
pity on your redneck ass.

808
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,171
Okay, give me ten minutes...

809
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,511
And if I catch...

810
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:53,761
Your skinny ass,
impersonating a nurse again,

811
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,637
I will rip your bladder out.

812
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,233
- Okay. Thank you.
- She said, "thank you."

813
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,190
- Regina: Ten minutes.
- Yeah, ten minutes.

814
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,439
We're just gonna wait here
for a minute.

815
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:11,574
Woman over radio: Hospital, code red.
Shelter in place.

816
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,245
Um...

817
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,543
Let's go to the nurse's station.

818
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,878
We're gonna go
to the nurse's station.

819
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,840
Why do we have to go
to the nurse's station?

820
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:25,209
- We just have to.
- Why?

821
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,002
People are there.

822
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,638
Throw that away.

823
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,686
Woman over radio:
Hospital, code red.

824
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,401
- You look sweaty.
- Shut up, let's go.

825
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:44,861
Wait.

826
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,194
- I just wanna go home.
- Janet: It's late

827
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,783
and I can't get a hold
of anyone.

828
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,027
Dorothy:
Well, then I'm going on a break.

829
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:55,202
We don't have time for you
to take a break, Dorothy.

830
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:59,376
Mandy, I need you out front.
Someone needs to be out there

831
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,368
to keep the public
from getting in.

832
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:04,373
It's like no one understands
what lockdown means.

833
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,876
I was just, um...
I was just going out

834
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:09,003
- for a smoke break.
- Is that a joke?

835
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,256
And you, little missy, need to
get back to your own floor.

836
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,177
- Yes, ma'am.
- Janet: Uh-huh.

837
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:16,348
- Mandy: I'll take her.
- Why would you need to do that?

838
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,344
Dammit, Mandy.

839
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:21,895
There is too much going on.
Just go before I write you up.

840
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,022
It's just been a long night.

841
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:30,900
For everyone. It's been
a long night for everyone.

842
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:31,487
Go.

843
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,032
Woman over radio: Hospital, code red.
Shelter in place.

844
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,495
Double go.

845
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,301
- Hey, you can't be back here.
- Help.

846
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,296
Help, really scary guy...

847
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,342
In the waiting room.

848
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,383
Probably the murderer
that you're looking for.

849
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,846
Huge, very huge, hulking.

850
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:41,516
- Okay, you stay here...
- Karen: Nope, no, no, no.

851
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,354
Definitely both of you 'cause...

852
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,143
Ne's huge.
So can you just, like...

853
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:50,024
Yes, waiting room.

854
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,072
Shawna: Oh, it's you.

855
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,244
Finally, I... I was calling
about my mother.

856
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,674
What can I do for you?

857
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:23,182
Oh, hi, we're on lock down.
You can't be on this floor.

858
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,599
Uh. Excuse me, who are you?

859
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,518
Hello?

860
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,353
Excuse me!

861
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,898
We are on lockdown!

862
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:37,242
Eliza: Did...
Did you speak to my daughter?

863
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,234
- What?
- You said you were gonna

864
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,703
- get her back up here.
- That... that was someone else.

865
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,540
My daughter needs
to know that I'm sick.

866
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,376
That's the reason
I'm in this fancy hotel.

867
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,416
Uh. Wha... wha...
What kind of sick?

868
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,047
I feel nauseated.
Can I get a warm towel?

869
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:55,010
- I'll get a nurse.
- You look like a nurse.

870
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:56,670
Who are you?

871
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,673
You are not supposed to be
in here.

872
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,592
- Regina: I'm a new nurse.
- In what unit?

873
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:06,142
- Uh. Today's my first day.
- Where do you work?

874
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,190
Third floor.
I just came down here

875
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:12,561
'cause, uh, I know this...
This woman.

876
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,527
Does she know you?

877
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:18,196
She's sick. Obviously.
Doesn't remember a damn thing,

878
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,741
but we are such good...

879
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:26,333
- Friends from church.
- I do go to church.

880
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,337
Well, what... is her name?

881
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:34,963
Uh. Patrick. Uh. Mrs. Patrick.

882
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,877
That's my married name.

883
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,379
Okay. Fine. Sorry, Mrs. Patrick.

884
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:42,474
I didn't realize that you
were such good friends.

885
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,808
You know we're on a lockdown?

886
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:46,349
You're not supposed
to leave your floor.

887
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:47,266
Really?

888
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,480
There was a dead body.

889
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:52,476
I found it. I was smoking,
please don't tell.

890
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:53,651
You need to go back upstairs.

891
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,986
Did they not announce
it up on third?

892
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,776
- No, no, no.
- Dorothy: Yes, they did.

893
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:00,617
You gotta get back up there.
Where are your shoes?

894
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,820
Uh...

895
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,415
- Help me!
- No, no.

896
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,085
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no.

897
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,502
I threw up.

898
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,471
Can you get that
warm towel for me?

899
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,559
You better not have
given me a disease.

900
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:35,144
Dammit. Goddammit.

901
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:38,363
Regina: You're strong.

902
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:43,702
Dammit! Dammit!

903
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,743
Eliza: Ma'am, are you okay?

904
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,497
Help me! Help us!

905
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,461
Hey, girl. Are you new?

906
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,318
Janet: Where do you think
you're going?

907
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,027
Just heading back
to the third floor.

908
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,272
No, ma'am. No elevators
'cause of lock down.

909
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,571
- You gotta take the stairs.
- Mm. Okay.

910
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,031
And make sure
that someone from your floor

911
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,324
comes down to assist the cops.

912
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:29,448
- Sure.
- We can't do everything.

913
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,120
Regina: Yep, thanks.

914
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:35,787
Could you tell if he was armed?

915
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,882
I don't know, don't murderers
always have weapons?

916
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,093
Well, I... I mean, he was...
He was here just a minute ago.

917
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,262
Uh. And like I said,
he was really, really...

918
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,134
He was really horrible-looking.

919
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,262
- Maybe he left.
- Or... or maybe he went back

920
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,513
into the hospital
and murder more people.

921
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:56,016
Murder people? What is going on?
Are we in danger here?

922
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,609
No, ma'am, everything is fine.
Just remain calm.

923
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,444
Woman: Well, I need to know
what's going on.

924
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,906
- I'm going. Good luck.
- Okay, good luck to you.

925
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,210
Well, hello.

926
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,878
Wow.

927
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:20,420
You look fucking gross, Regina.

928
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,463
You know, I've been...

929
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,007
I've been looking for you,
skanky.

930
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,846
Good.

931
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,594
I was looking for you too.

932
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,888
Hmm, you know,
I'm supposed to drag you back

933
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,352
to Nicholas by your hair.

934
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,562
That's a little extreme,
don't you think?

935
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:37,729
Now, I've got legs.
I can just walk.

936
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:40,819
Don't you want a damn kidney?

937
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,234
Oh, it's a little late for that.

938
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,613
Look...

939
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:48,156
It's not my fault.
My stupid cousin...

940
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:51,781
She lost it, but...
But she got me another one.

941
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,453
- Oh, yeah?
- Regina: Mm-hmm.

942
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:57,456
No.

943
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,298
No, do not try all that
sexy shit with me, Regina.

944
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:03,917
You are covered in blood
and puke.

945
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,674
Not impressed.

946
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:10,174
- Told you.
- That's a great cooler.

947
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:13,552
- Can you open it up?
- A lot of work went into this.

948
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:19,934
You wouldn't believe the trouble
we went to to get you this.

949
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,444
Now, what the fuck?

950
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,694
What the fuck indeed, Regina.

951
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:27,701
Come here.

952
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,530
- Oh, wait.
- Mikey: Come here!

953
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,422
Thanks for these.

954
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,591
Maybe the nicest thing
you ever did for me.

955
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,428
Stephen: Mandy?

956
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,932
This is the suspicious woman,
ma'am?

957
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,766
I don't think so.

958
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,976
It is Mandy, isn't it?

959
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,723
- Yeah.
- This isn't her.

960
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,815
Mandy?

961
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,563
What are you doing
with my patient?

962
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,435
- Excuse me.
- Mandy: Uh...

963
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,904
Goddammit! Again?

964
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,694
All right, now go over
with me again

965
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:11,239
where you were around 2:00 A.M.

966
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:12,702
- You saw me.
- In the morgue.

967
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,071
What were you doing
in the morgue?

968
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,413
You have no business
being in there.

969
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:18,534
I was checking
a deceased patient's records.

970
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:22,129
Officer Myers,
this woman is on probation.

971
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:23,838
That is an internal probation

972
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:25,298
and he doesn't need to know
about it.

973
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:29,090
It's relevant
and now it's extended.

974
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,587
Stephen:
If you were checking records

975
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,931
in the morgue,
why were you covered in blood?

976
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,675
Oh, that's what happens
in a morgue.

977
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:38,474
- But you changed?
- Mandy: That's what we do.

978
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,268
Don't wanna walk around
covered in blood.

979
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,434
That's right.

980
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,275
Come on, Janet, you know me.

981
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,364
What were you doing
with those vials?

982
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,326
Checking them,
seeing what you had him on.

983
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,946
- And why would you do that?
- Hey.

984
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,289
That's enough. I think
we're gonna have to go down

985
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,079
to the station
and talk this thing out.

986
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,372
- Ohl
- Unless, you can explain to me

987
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,790
what's going on.

988
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,756
That's my brother.

989
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,178
That's my brother
in that room in a coma.

990
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:19,224
The drug addict.
I was worried about him.

991
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:22,893
She's lying.

992
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:25,893
She has never mentioned
a brother, not once.

993
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:28,361
I'm not lying, Jesus. I'm...

994
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:32,198
His name is Andrew mccandry.

995
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,069
My half-brother.

996
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:37,447
He has od'd three times
in the past two years.

997
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,118
And this time...

998
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,082
May be his last,
according to what

999
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:43,828
I just read on that chart.
Did you check his files?

1000
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,371
- Yeah.
- Mandy: That's right, isn't it?

1001
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,044
Yeah. That's right.

1002
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,587
I'm sorry,
I really do trust you.

1003
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:54,179
I just wanted to make sure
he was getting the best care.

1004
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,423
I care about him and...

1005
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,513
So much I care about him.

1006
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,193
Fuck, I believe you.

1007
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,782
Thank you, officer Myers.

1008
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,072
But you still gotta come down
to the station with me.

1009
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,741
I got a lot of questions
for you, Mandy.

1010
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,615
I just answered
all your questions.

1011
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:22,957
Officer: Stephen.

1012
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:26,920
Ma'am. Uh. We got an issue.
A new one.

1013
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,669
Oh. Mandy, come with me.

1014
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:35,546
I can still get you a kidney.
I know how.

1015
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,886
You are so fucking stupid,
do you know that?

1016
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,018
Every teacher I ever had
told me that already,

1017
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,431
so shut up!

1018
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:45,935
These nurses...

1019
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:48,771
They just go for someone
on the verge of death

1020
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,314
so no one notices.

1021
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:53,984
Me and you can take one
of these dying fuckers

1022
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:56,358
and just drag him on outta here.

1023
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,655
Use a whole damn body
if you want.

1024
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,153
It'll be fresh as hell.

1025
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,998
You'll probably make Nicholas
real happy.

1026
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,912
Well, you don't just get
a kidney.

1027
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:08,127
You get all the organs inside.

1028
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,919
I know the exact dying asshole
you can use.

1029
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,179
Just having a lover's quarrel.

1030
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,344
I've been there.

1031
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,017
It's raining, huh?

1032
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:30,062
Yeah, it's really pissing out
there tonight.

1033
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:37,237
- I know you. Don't I?
- Mikey: Regina.

1034
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,735
Didn't you say had someone
you needed to see inside?

1035
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:43,705
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's leave the man alone.

1036
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,410
Good seeing you again, blondie.

1037
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,002
Stephen: Call it in.

1038
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,046
- Where's his pants?
- Officer: Charmaine,

1039
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,923
we've got a 10-74
at the hospital.

1040
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:05,017
Stephan:
Looks pretty dead to me.

1041
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,579
Hey, hey, you're not permitted
to leave.

1042
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,533
Hey, Mandy! Mandy, hey!

1043
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:32,129
Go downstairs, wait for backup.
Hey, hey.

1044
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,834
What the hell's wrong with you?

1045
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:34,375
Janet: Mandy!

1046
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,000
- Someone get in here!
- Co... come on!

1047
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,636
- Whoa.
- Mandy: What the fuck?

1048
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,012
Please, dear, don't curse.

1049
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,930
She's alive, someone get
a stretcher.

1050
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:52,728
A... all right, everybody
just calm down.

1051
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,818
- Li didn't do it.
- What the fuck is happening?

1052
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:58,734
- What did you do, Mandy?
- I was with you.

1053
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,151
Hey, hey, stay calm.

1054
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,366
- I'll go get help.
- No, no, you stay here

1055
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,325
and I... I... I'll call it in.

1056
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,819
We need to get that
woman off the ground

1057
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,323
and help her now.
She is bleeding, badly.

1058
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,040
Shit! Fuck! Mandy!

1059
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,749
You are not permitted
to go anywhere.

1060
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,838
I took an oath to help people,
officer Myers.

1061
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:18,254
I'm not just gonna leave Dorothy
on the floor dying.

1062
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,253
And I'm telling you
not to fucking move.

1063
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:24,472
I'll come clean with you.

1064
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,386
There may be someone
in the hospital

1065
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:30,182
doing all of this
and I know who it is.

1066
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,858
Shit.

1067
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,443
I fucking hate cops.

1068
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,033
But we already went over this.

1069
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:50,906
Get the fuck off of him.

1070
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,705
Regina:
I couldn't find any bleach!

1071
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,214
Mikey: Oh, man!

1072
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,047
Mikey: Ooh!

1073
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:02,544
What the fuck? What the fuck?
Fucking bitch!

1074
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,796
Both of you get the fuck outta
here.

1075
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,547
I gotta get some organs.

1076
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:09,426
There is a kidney in the cooler.

1077
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,392
It's gone!

1078
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,352
- You are lying.
- That's the truth.

1079
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:15,019
Are you telling me you lost
two kidneys in one night?

1080
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,687
- She said you lost them.
- She did.

1081
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:17,604
I'm the one who got them
for her.

1082
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:19,648
- How could I lose 'em?
- This is too much talking.

1083
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,645
We taking this guy with us
or what?

1084
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,114
No, you are not. You are gonna
go back to Nicholas

1085
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,571
and you are gonna tell him
this shit is off.

1086
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,818
He can go to hell
and so can you.

1087
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,411
Come on, what the fuck
did Andrew ever do for you

1088
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,906
except give you an addiction,
huh?

1089
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:35,126
What the fuck is happening?
Get off of her!

1090
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,425
Fuck.

1091
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,508
Stephan: Freeze!

1092
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:47,756
No!

1093
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:49,428
You freeze.

1094
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,969
Fuck! Fuck.

1095
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,058
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1096
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:58,524
- I don't wanna shoot you!
- You already fucking shot me!

1097
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,268
I don't wanna shoot you again!

1098
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,235
You fucking asshole.

1099
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:02,774
I have hostages.

1100
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,818
Just back away from the door
and let me through.

1101
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,487
Stephen: Don't hurt 'em.

1102
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:09,702
Patch me up, now!

1103
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,118
- Okay. Okay.
- Mikey: Come on.

1104
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,911
- I'm coming.
- Mikey: Fuck.

1105
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,624
Don't try anything weird.

1106
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,504
The bullet is in there.
You need to get it out.

1107
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:25,297
Mikey: Yeah, I know that.

1108
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,260
You think this is the first time
I've been shot?

1109
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:28,846
I'm coming in!

1110
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,556
I swear to god, I will shoot
both these bitches!

1111
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,052
We're gonna go out the backdoor
and you're gonna let us!

1112
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:34,848
No, you're not!

1113
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,723
I will shoot them
if they try anything!

1114
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,894
And we're taking this fucker
with us.

1115
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,937
- Get him in the wheelchair.
- No fucking way.

1116
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:44,028
Regina said we can have
all his organs, let's go!

1117
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,864
You are not taking my brother.

1118
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:50,156
Save him or save yourself.
It's your choice.

1119
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:52,074
We are taking him regardless.

1120
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,993
Mandy, what's going on in there?

1121
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:04,458
Okay. I'll do it.
Get that gun out of my face.

1122
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,965
Regina, get the wheelchair.

1123
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,307
Let's go. Go, go, go, go.

1124
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,559
Damn, get the thing out
of his face.

1125
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:25,486
Come on, hang on. Dammit.

1126
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:29,608
Goddammit.

1127
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:31,821
All right.

1128
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,615
Uh. We're gonna head downstairs
and when we get outside,

1129
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,365
- I'm taking him with me.
- Stay where you are!

1130
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,660
Jesus Christ, shut up!

1131
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,624
- Shit!
- Regina: What's happening?

1132
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,671
Don't these people need, like,
machines to breathe and shit?

1133
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,713
I swear to god,
what did you do, lady?

1134
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,426
It is just the lights.

1135
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,762
Backup generator takes care
of all the vital stuff.

1136
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:56,430
Now... we are going
to go down the hall,

1137
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,517
carry him down the stairs,

1138
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:58,978
and you can go out
the backdoor, okay?

1139
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,141
All right, but I'm taking
Regina with me.

1140
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,891
- Mandy: Regina is staying here.
- Mikey: No, she does not.

1141
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:07,271
That is the deal.
You get Andrew, I get Regina.

1142
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,192
You know,
I don't have time for this shit.

1143
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,069
Fine, fuck it, whatever.
You push him. Go!

1144
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,040
Wait, I wanna give him
a sedative.

1145
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:19,623
Mikey: Why?

1146
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,868
So he doesn't wake up
in the middle of you

1147
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,460
operating on him.

1148
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,920
Fuck.

1149
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:32,921
- Fuck!
- You got this?

1150
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,256
Yeah. Yeah.

1151
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,809
Nurse, hurry up!

1152
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,144
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is going on?

1153
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,813
- Mandy: I'm nervous.
- Regina: Junkie.

1154
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,572
Mikey: Oh, my fucking eye!

1155
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,821
- Mandy: Go.
- Bitches!

1156
01:12:57,832 --> 01:12:59,163
Why take Andrew? Leave him.

1157
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,248
Mandy: I don't want him
taken away for organs.

1158
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,207
Why the fuck are you so nice

1159
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,542
to someone
who just treated you like shit?

1160
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,502
- You treat me like shit.
- Regina: We gotta go.

1161
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,838
- Hold on!
- Regina: Get up!

1162
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:33,649
- He's got my knife.
- Mikey: Crazy cunts.

1163
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,200
Mandy: I'm going out the front.

1164
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:40,446
I can't do that,
they got cops outside.

1165
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,870
Janet: Mandy?

1166
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:43,248
Mandy?

1167
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,868
Did you hear that noise,
what the fuck is going on?

1168
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,880
Janet, run!

1169
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,792
Mikey: Goddammit.

1170
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,629
Sorry, ma'am.

1171
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,765
Go in that room
and lock the door.

1172
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:00,929
Gol

1173
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:08,687
Regina: Shit.

1174
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,685
Someone turned out
my nightlight.

1175
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,560
What is happening here?

1176
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:13,108
Do you know why the lights
went out?

1177
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,730
And is this blood on the floor?

1178
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,028
Y'all just need to stay cool.

1179
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:18,745
Shit.

1180
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:27,084
You assholes took my eye!

1181
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,251
Mandy: Janet, Janet.
Come on, come on.

1182
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,337
That's right, put your head up.

1183
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,177
What's going on?

1184
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:43,434
Mandy: Okay, lift up
for one second, one second.

1185
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,519
Okay.

1186
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,776
No! That's my friend!
From church!

1187
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,900
Mikey: Dammit.

1188
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,118
Get the fuck outta here!

1189
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:02,737
He's in there. Run.

1190
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,363
- Mikey: Get the fuck over here!
- No!

1191
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,455
You think you can just run away

1192
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,949
and I wouldn't catch you?

1193
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,201
Well, now I'm taking
both of y'all,

1194
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,827
you and the fucking
wheelchair boy.

1195
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,171
There's gotta be something
useful inside each of you,

1196
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,086
unless yours is blackened
from painkillers!

1197
01:15:15,094 --> 01:15:16,834
Mikey, don't hurt her.

1198
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:23,432
Okay, y'all go!
Go, this ain't gonna last long.

1199
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,094
Run!

1200
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,389
Oh, shit.

1201
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,768
Oh, come on.

1202
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,013
What the fuck, ladies?

1203
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,640
I know you're out here
somewhere.

1204
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,689
Come on, bitches,
it's cold out here!

1205
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,361
Where you at?

1206
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:23,651
Woo.

1207
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:25,695
You out in that rain?

1208
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,537
Ooh, you better be running
in that rain!

1209
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:31,872
You better be singing
in that rain! Enjoying it!

1210
01:16:32,797 --> 01:16:34,583
But I know you're not...

1211
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,422
Not with all them cops
out there...

1212
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,589
'Cause I may do some...

1213
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,428
Illegal shit...

1214
01:16:43,891 --> 01:16:47,930
But it ain't nothing
compared to you two lunatics.

1215
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:52,146
But I got plans for y'all.

1216
01:16:57,738 --> 01:16:58,944
Mm.

1217
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,071
Spurt.

1218
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,741
Better come on out...

1219
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,450
'Cause both y'all have
an appointment...

1220
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,415
To have all your little organs
taken outta

1221
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,999
your skinny little bodies!

1222
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,354
- He's dead.
- No.

1223
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,695
Are you a good witch
or bad witch?

1224
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:47,530
There cops out there?

1225
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,529
Yeah, and we'll scream
if you try anything.

1226
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,280
- No, you won't.
- Are you here to kill us?

1227
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:53,829
No. But I need your help
getting outta here.

1228
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:54,916
Mandy, do something, help me.

1229
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,787
No, you're a fucking psychopath.
This is all your fault.

1230
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,710
- It's yours.
- Just take her.

1231
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:04,802
Thank you kindly, ma'am.
She sure is a pretty one.

1232
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:11,468
Blonde hair and blue eyes.

1233
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:24,863
I wasn't gonna hurt her.

1234
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:27,108
I was just gonna use
her to get outta here.

1235
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:31,533
You better hurry up.

1236
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,624
- You girls are crazy.
- Go home, Regina.

1237
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,745
Get the fuck outta here.

1238
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:42,085
Is this gonna give me a disease?

1239
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,458
No, just go home.

1240
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,835
You can't wear that.

1241
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,671
Take it off.

1242
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:52,053
Am ll... am I fired?

1243
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,426
Mandy: Oh, yeah.

1244
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,930
Yeah. I... I won't tell no one.

1245
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,356
I know you won't.

1246
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:13,450
See you around, then, cuz.

1247
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,912
Yeah. See ya.

1248
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:24,006
Newscaster 2: More on
that in the next hour.

1249
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:25,590
Our top story this
morning concerns

1250
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,585
the three deaths reported
at the local hospital

1251
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,054
over night, with two additional
people in critical condition.

1252
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:34,221
What's now being considered
a combination of a suicide,

1253
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:37,220
a potential homicide,
and a freak accident

1254
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:39,973
is currently
under investigation.

1255
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,061
The police are on the scene now,

1256
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,606
but due to the y2k
preparation weekend,

1257
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,899
much of the police force
wasn't in the area

1258
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:48,317
when the events began to unfold.

1259
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,486
But the official statement
from the chief

1260
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:52,200
is that the delays
in police arrival

1261
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:53,819
did not contribute
to additional...

1262
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,197
Deaths and injuries.

1263
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:58,198
It's been a tragic year.

1264
01:19:58,210 --> 01:19:59,771
We extend our condolences
to the families

1265
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,162
of those injured or killed
in the hospital last night.

1266
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,253
The investigation is still open,

1267
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:06,874
but we've been informed
that the area is secure.

1268
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:10,298
We'll be hearing more from
the police later today.

1269
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:37,239
I told officer Myers all that.
And he said I was free to leave.

1270
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:42,789
I was real sad
about Mr. Collins.

1271
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,754
He just couldn't handle
being here anymore.

1272
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:51,253
No one deserves to go that way,
but I... I think it was suicide.

1273
01:20:51,263 --> 01:20:56,132
Uh, uh. Sir,
you are not listening to me.

1274
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:56,674
He was a madman.

1275
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,300
He... he clearly killed
all these people.

1276
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,303
I mean, what kind
of hospital is this?

1277
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:02,771
Karen: Ma'am, uh,
can I get you a drink of water?

1278
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:05,767
- Yes, you can!
- You wanna come with me?

1279
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:12,072
She's right. He was crazy.

1280
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,991
We may have some
more questions for you,

1281
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,452
but I think I've got
all your information,

1282
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,367
so you should be okay.

1283
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:37,089
- Is everybody dead?
- No.

1284
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,675
Janet may not be able
to talk for a while,

1285
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,928
but that cute cop
ain't doing so good.

1286
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:47,024
- Cute ones always die.
- You mind helping?

1287
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:50,019
My shift just ended.

1288
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,187
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1289
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:55,107
Don't you dare touch her.

1290
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:58,782
I don't want anyone
in this hospital near her!

1291
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,321
Are you going home?

1292
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:04,325
No, they want me to stay
until things get settled.

1293
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,327
That's a long shift for you.

1294
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:09,045
Yeah, well,
I'm getting overtime.

1295
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:16,175
- Uh... I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see ya.

1296
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:24,386
How you doing?

1297
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,181
Mr. Kent: That was very strange.

1298
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,683
Why is this so small?
And this so big?

1299
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:32,562
Who's gonna do something
with these bags that I found?

1300
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:33,437
Who's gonna help me with this?

1301
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:36,987
Someone gonna do something
with these bags that I found?

1302
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:37,866
I found this one,

1303
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:40,156
looks like they're
chock-full of organ meat.

1304
01:22:40,164 --> 01:22:42,450
I found this
at the soda machine.

1305
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,664
I went down for a nice drink

1306
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,623
and then I went down
again later,

1307
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,208
'cause no one's seen me
for a while,

1308
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,622
and then I found this one.

1309
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,121
It looks like someone
was keeping them there.

1310
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,714
Oh, oh, now you're gonna
pay attention.

1311
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,050
- Got the organs in my hands.
- Whoa, whoa.

1312
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:55,587
Okay, thank you.

1313
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,212
This has about seven
or eight different ones inside.

1314
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,930
Yeah, and I had... I kept
the soda far away, it's fine.

1315
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:03,388
I'm a little dizzy.
You need to be very careful

1316
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,805
with your hands.
