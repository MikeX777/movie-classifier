1
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,859
I am here because...

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,761
I recognize...

3
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,599
in my life there has been
a major imbalance,

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,969
mainly caused by...

5
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,439
what I have done in a criminal way.

6
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,010
I want to promise myself

7
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,813
that this is going to be
the most honest...

8
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,482
confession of my life,

9
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,586
and in doing that,

10
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,156
I need to make
the long journey backwards

11
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,091
to understand what I did,

12
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,794
to acknowledge that,

13
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:39,032
in some way to make
reparation for it,

14
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:43,036
and to let those
whom I have offended

15
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,172
know that, if possible.

16
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,141
Basically what I want
to say to them is, you know,

17
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,676
it should not have happened.

18
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,812
It should not have happened.

19
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:18,104
When I saw him the first time,

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,141
oh, I think it was
love at first sight.

21
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,409
- I agree.
- I really do.

22
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,845
It was easy to talk to her.

23
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,848
It must be. We've been
together 41 years now.

24
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,554
But he wasn't really
practicing Buddhism.

25
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,823
He used to go with me to church.

26
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,625
Yeah. Before I even met you,

27
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,194
I think I used to go to the chapel,

28
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,930
just for peace and quiet,
you know, so...

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,099
But then I still had to go to Ireland

30
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,002
and talk to Maria's dad
and ask for her hand.

31
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,737
- By then you were baptized.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,573
- I think that was a big
concern for my family. - Yeah.

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,278
We got married
December 26, 1964.

34
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,147
I told Maria, I said,
"Would you like to go to the States?"

35
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,315
It was a big step,

36
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,052
but, you know, I was willing
to go anywhere Bob was going.

37
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,053
Yeah.

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,757
Ann was born May 9, 1966.

39
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,992
Yeah, a bundle of joy, really.

40
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,294
- She really was.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,229
'Cause Bob was working
12 hours a day.

42
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,431
We'd get dressed up,
and we'd go outside

43
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,633
and wait for Bob
when he was coming home.

44
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,101
Oh, she'd say, "Hi, Daddy",

45
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,337
and give me a hug
and kiss, you know.

46
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,905
She was a perfect
little lady, you know.

47
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,574
You could take her anyplace.

48
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,077
In her own little way,
she was taking care of me.

49
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,113
So then I went to work
one day a week,

50
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:36,049
and then we decided
we'd buy a house... this one.

51
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,984
This one here.

52
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,686
The one and only house we got.

53
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,622
I was raised a really
strict Catholic in Ireland.

54
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,023
I mean, that was our life.

55
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,024
Yeah, and...

56
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,060
There is no other religion.

57
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:51,264
I thought she was a shining
example of a good Catholic

58
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,832
who had faith in her religion

59
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:57,303
whether I accepted all the beliefs
of the Catholic Church or not.

60
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,805
But I believed something...

61
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,441
And, you know, you raise
your kids that way, you know.

62
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:02,909
That was part of our life.

63
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,878
- It was our life, actually.
- It was.

64
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,680
I found peace there,

65
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,150
and, you know, comfort, I guess.

66
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,671
Some people are born
to be leaders,

67
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,140
some people are born to
follow, et cetera, you know.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,643
I like helping people,

69
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,512
and, as one of my priest
friends said to me once,

70
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,147
he said, "You're
a people person".

71
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,616
And I think that helped a lot to say,

72
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,020
"Hey, I finally reached what...
or I'd like to do.

73
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,155
"I think this is
what I want to do.

74
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,758
I think this is what
I'm called to do."

75
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,593
I like to be with people.

76
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,464
I felt I was good with people.

77
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,132
I felt I was good with children.

78
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,467
I've often asked myself,

79
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,203
Why did I...

80
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,671
Why do I like children so much?

81
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,408
What do I want to do for them?

82
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:12,011
I feel compassionate to children
that I see sort of cornered and...

83
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:16,216
who image what I was
when I was their age

84
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,852
and did not have

85
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,955
somebody to turn to.

86
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,557
I tend to want to reach out
to people like that.

87
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,293
First time we met him was in 1971.

88
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,063
I was so excited to meet
somebody from home.

89
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,397
And I'd only been here,

90
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,099
like, five years at that time.

91
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:38,004
He would come and spend
his days off here.

92
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,540
He had a really strong Irish accent
at that time,

93
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,275
so we used to help him
with his sermons,

94
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,512
and Ann would go places with him.

95
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,714
Ann Jyono.

96
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,784
Little Ann... Ann was one of
the first people I met there,

97
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,352
or at least her parents.

98
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:56,556
Her mother was Irish,
father was Japanese...

99
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,025
of Japanese extraction, I think...

100
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,828
and was very welcome
at their home

101
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,932
for many, many years
of my time in Lodi.

102
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:10,970
I could, and was often
invited, to sleep over there.

103
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,940
Perhaps that's where
some of the problems began

104
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,509
in that... in Ann's situation.

105
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,951
There are two types
of people in the Church:

106
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:29,255
the hierarchy in the sacred
pastures, as they call them,

107
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,658
who are picked out by God to lead,

108
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,793
and the vast throng
who are the lay people,

109
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,430
and their duty is to be docile,
obedient followers.

110
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,399
It says that.

111
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,000
The system, it's a monarchy.

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,703
All power rests in individuals,

113
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,639
and so the system
protects those individuals

114
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,575
because it believes
that that is the will

115
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,710
of the higher power,
of the Almighty:

116
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,413
that He wants those individuals

117
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,549
to be powerful in order to control

118
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,552
this portion of reality called Earth.

119
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,688
And that's, I think, is...

120
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,024
It may sound simplistic
and like science fiction,

121
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,559
but that, in fact, is what it is.

122
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,232
I was...

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,201
a student for eight
years at Holy Spirit,

124
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,670
which is in the Sacramento Diocese,

125
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,673
and they had some kind of
advertisement to Camp Pendola,

126
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,543
and it was my first time
ever going away to camp.

127
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,146
None of my friends
went to school there.

128
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,548
I didn't know
anybody else there,

129
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,284
and I actually wrote
a letter to my mom

130
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,786
that she had...

131
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,254
On the back of the envelope,

132
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,791
I said I met a new friend, and
his name was Father O'Grady.

133
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:41,761
I remember him coming on a
sleep-over with the other girls,

134
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,696
and a couple of days later,

135
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,432
the other girls breaking out
with poison oak,

136
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,468
and them telling me that
I didn't have poison oak

137
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,303
'cause I slept with Father.

138
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,842
And I think the thing that
I'm going to regret most

139
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,611
is that I allowed myself to...

140
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,015
just to cuddling alongside her
in bed one night

141
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,650
when she was visiting with me.

142
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,318
I would...

143
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,921
label it love and concern...

144
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,690
hugging, embracing.

145
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,959
That tended to...

146
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,163
satisfy me and...

147
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,301
in a way that took care of my need

148
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,337
to reach out to somebody, you know.

149
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,041
From there, I don't know
how the relationship started,

150
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,443
that he got my address,

151
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,980
that he got in contact
with my parents.

152
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,415
He...

153
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,986
came over to the house
a couple of times.

154
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,955
My mother's from Argentina,

155
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:46,759
so she has more
of a trusting attitude.

156
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,528
She had told him, I think,

157
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,664
that I was pulling away
from the family a little bit.

158
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,735
She thought it was a good idea
for me to spend time with him.

159
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,343
If somebody asked me,
"Where was", you know,

160
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,511
"What...

161
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,582
What kicks the bucket for you?"

162
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,718
Whatever the thing is.

163
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:12,986
"What triggers things off for you?"

164
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,555
You know, "What areas would be?"

165
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:20,193
And, if given a variety
of areas to consider,

166
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,531
you know, I'd have to say
certainly on the younger level.

167
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,868
That's where a lot of that surfaced.

168
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,804
And if they said to me,

169
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,373
"Well, do you feel aroused
when you see women?"

170
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,941
I'd probably say no.

171
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,576
"Do you feel aroused
when you see men?" No.

172
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,711
"Do you feel aroused
if you've seen children?"

173
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,046
I'd say, "Well, maybe".

174
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,916
"How about children who are...

175
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:43,983
in swimsuits?"

176
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,952
I'd say, "Yeah".

177
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,821
"How about children in underwear?"

178
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,890
I'd say, "Yeah", you know?

179
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,259
How about... "If you thought
you saw children naked?"

180
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,627
And I'd say, "Mmm, yeah".

181
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,831
My last memory...

182
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,834
of Oliver...

183
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,769
is severe...

184
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,440
pain...

185
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,511
before I black out.

186
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:21,488
Years ago, Case was
Pastor of St. Anne's,

187
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:26,126
and the parents called Case,

188
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,161
and said to him,

189
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:34,000
"You know, when we
picked up our daughter,

190
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,337
"she was not herself at all.

191
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:42,242
"She was very nervous
and looked very jumpy

192
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:46,246
and looked extremely anxious."

193
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,882
I mean, he took me out of the house.

194
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,651
I said, you know, "Sometimes
I get carsick on the road".

195
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,253
He said, "Put your
head on my lap",

196
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,888
and, boom, the abuse started.

197
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,556
I mean, I was on Highway 12,

198
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,659
you know, two minutes away
from my house, and it started.

199
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:04,197
And for 96 hours, that abuse was
happening until my parents came

200
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,099
and said, "Did you
have fun with Father?"

201
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,034
And I'm, like, "He
tickled me too much".

202
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,804
How do you tell your parents
what you just went through?

203
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,607
They finally got it out of her that,

204
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,409
during the night,

205
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,347
Ollie had come into her room
and had molested her.

206
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,219
I think I tried to be
affectionate with her

207
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,789
by kissing her on the mouth.

208
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,859
And I know that my
hand went down,

209
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,528
and I think I brought
up her night dress

210
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,897
and tried to...

211
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:42,869
not tried to, I did touch
her in the genital area,

212
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,171
perhaps outside
her clothing at first

213
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,074
and maybe, although
I can't be specific,

214
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:52,879
I think I probably tried to put
my hand inside her underwear,

215
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,483
and I think that's about
the time I realized that...

216
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,820
it was not correct to continue,

217
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,089
and, although I'm not...

218
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,061
paraphrasing exactly
what I remember I did,

219
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,198
but I think I want to say that
I stopped shortly afterwards

220
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,433
and...

221
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,069
left the bed,

222
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,705
left the room,
and went back to my own bed.

223
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,175
Case said, "Have you
ever done this before?"

224
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,244
And, "No".

225
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,645
And... So he told him.

226
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:30,083
He said, "Ollie, this is outrageous.

227
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,886
"This is the very type of thing

228
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,156
"that people can go to prison for.

229
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:41,227
I want you to sit down and
write a letter of apology."

230
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,097
I took, you know, the occasion

231
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:47,066
to write my letter to the victim,

232
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,037
and to say,
"Hey, I'm sorry".

233
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,672
"May I say first of all

234
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,042
"that this is a difficult
letter for me to write.

235
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,278
"I have come to
like Nancy very much

236
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:01,614
"and wanted to express my
friendship and love for her

237
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,250
"by having her come stay with me.

238
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,554
"I also must admit

239
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:10,023
"that I feel very
affectionate towards Nancy,

240
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,459
"as I am sure I have
displayed many times,

241
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,128
"even in your presence.

242
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,530
"Now comes the difficult part.

243
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:24,671
"Did I touch Nancy in areas
which I shouldn't have?

244
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:29,776
"I have to admit that I
did on a few occasions.

245
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,846
"I guess I became
overly affectionate,

246
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,181
"and took advantage
of the situation

247
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,951
"and went a little too far.

248
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:42,522
"I have already written for an
appointment with my bishop.

249
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:46,993
"I realize the big responsibility
I have as a priest,

250
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,297
"and the high ideals
which I must uphold.

251
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,735
"But I am also painfully
aware of my own weakness,

252
00:13:55,802 --> 00:14:00,039
"and how hard it is at times

253
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,276
"to keep the
ideals of priesthood

254
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,211
"in front of me...

255
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:17,557
"when temptations to
satisfy one's own ego

256
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,893
present themselves."

257
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,433
He said, "You need to know

258
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:30,336
I've already called
Bishop Guilfoyle",

259
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,640
who was the
bishop at the time,

260
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,009
and...

261
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,178
"As soon as our
talk is finished here,

262
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,646
you're getting
right in the car."

263
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,848
I mean, my mother says

264
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,417
that when she was having
the meeting with Guilfoyle,

265
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,319
he was completely saying,

266
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,055
"Oh, I'm sure Nancy just
misunderstood his actions.

267
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,356
"I'm sure she...

268
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,592
what she says happened
really didn't happen."

269
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,062
Even though Oliver had
already made an appointment,

270
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:00,033
Guilfoyle had already talked
to Case DeGroot about it.

271
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,102
My mom's having this meeting,

272
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,571
and he's saying, "Oh, I'm sure
nothing really happened",

273
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,638
blah, blah, blah.

274
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,741
My mom pulls out this letter, and
she said his face went beet-red.

275
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,610
He was furious
because of the letter.

276
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:13,246
Why was he angry about that?

277
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,915
For legal reasons, I'm sure.

278
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:18,585
Of the, you know...
I think he was anxious

279
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,622
that the letter be destroyed

280
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,291
or in some way...

281
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,694
disappear.

282
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,031
Case wanted to make sure

283
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:37,637
that Ollie was going to be
getting counseling for this,

284
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,241
but when he inquired,

285
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,744
the bishop felt that...

286
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,313
he had done his part,
he had brought him down,

287
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,118
and, in essence,
his part was over,

288
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,622
and he should not continue
to be a part of this.

289
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,795
I remember saying
one time to Case...

290
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,397
we were driving somewhere,

291
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:41,968
and Ollie's name came up
for one or another reason:

292
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,504
what he does on his
day off, you know,

293
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,840
and...

294
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,875
when I said, "Well, you know,

295
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:53,313
he sleeps over
at Maria's house",

296
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:58,685
and I could see he
got so, like, nervous,

297
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:01,621
but he didn't say
anything to me.

298
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,960
The reasons we asked him
to stay overnight sometimes

299
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,796
is because the
church can be hectic,

300
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,966
and, like, a priest
can be on 24-hour duty

301
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:17,237
because parishioners
may need help,

302
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,507
and it was kind of like a relief
to get away from work.

303
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:24,544
The duties that a
priest has to perform

304
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,913
shouldn't take up all his time.

305
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:29,549
And I do remember
one time, I think...

306
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,552
And that was his answer
to non-married priests.

307
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,621
- In other religions they're married.
- Yeah.

308
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,657
It would be so much
easier to help people

309
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:38,992
in the Catholic religion...

310
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,660
'Cause you know
what a family's like.

311
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,595
...if they had a family of their own,

312
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,764
and he used to say
he couldn't do that.

313
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:45,999
He couldn't do both.

314
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,768
Yeah, 'cause of the work
with the church

315
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,136
that, you know,

316
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:53,673
what he says is dedication
to the Church, you know.

317
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,376
You have to have celibacy
because you can't give...

318
00:17:56,443 --> 00:18:00,213
But I says, "How do you know
how a family functions?"

319
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,651
And he would say,
"Well, by education, school".

320
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,053
You know, looking back
at it now in reflection,

321
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,524
it's more like a power trip
that he would have us robe him,

322
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,726
like he was a deity, you know?

323
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,396
Like he was the king
or something, you know?

324
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:20,667
He would call us
out of class, you know.

325
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,136
He had total control of us

326
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,571
'cause he was at our school,

327
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:28,274
he was at our home,
he was at church.

328
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:32,645
In a Catholic lifestyle,
what else is left after that?

329
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,381
What part of my
life wasn't he at?

330
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,716
I... Absolutely, you know.

331
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,518
I mean, there's an
awful lot of my areas

332
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:41,788
that I was ill-equipped
to handle, you know.

333
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,223
Counseling would be one of them.

334
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,625
If I were back in, I'd
never counsel people,

335
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,727
unless I took training
in it, you know.

336
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,898
Because apparently I wasn't
able to spot the differences,

337
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,768
spot the elements that...

338
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,537
There were danger signals

339
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,907
That a therapist, you
know, would know to say,

340
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,476
"Oh, there's transference
here", you know.

341
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,112
This person is not alone,
coming to me once a week.

342
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,182
This person is calling me
on the phone twice a day.

343
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,618
This person is calling
me on the phone

344
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,621
about things that are
insignificant right now.

345
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,556
"My God, what do
I have for dinner?"

346
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,792
Whatever you like.
Why are you calling me?

347
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,595
You've had dinner before.
You'll have dinner again.

348
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,864
But, you know, what
was there about me

349
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:28,168
that kind of said
"You can call me",

350
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,336
you know?

351
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,473
This was somebody that
we knew for 23 years,

352
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,775
totally trusted.

353
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,910
We trusted him because...

354
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,912
And now, you know,
I hear, you know,

355
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,914
things he did with other families,

356
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,384
and...

357
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,453
I just feel...

358
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,456
I never saw that side of him.

359
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,057
You know, we were
supporting him

360
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,326
up to the very, very end,

361
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:57,464
'cause he was...
he was the perfect...

362
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,500
example of what you would
think a priest would be

363
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,635
when he was here in our house.

364
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,505
I mean, he was
always respectful.

365
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,842
He was... Anything that I
saw with him with the kids,

366
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,176
he was fine.

367
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,478
He would stay here.

368
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,879
I mean, you'd see him
in here in the morning

369
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,248
reading his Bible.

370
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:16,549
He was everything that I...

371
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:17,951
I'd go to work and...

372
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,353
He was the closest thing
to God that we knew.

373
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,361
Being Catholic is...

374
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:32,031
not like being a Lutheran
or a Presbyterian.

375
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,301
The thing that,
for a lot of non-Catholics

376
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,036
is hard to understand is,

377
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,639
the Church teaches that
the only way to salvation,

378
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,641
if you're Catholic, is
through the Church,

379
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,777
and if you're not in
communion with the Church,

380
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,211
you're damned to hell.

381
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,614
And it's not just kind
of like without-God hell.

382
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,650
It's fire and brimstone
hell for eternity.

383
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,120
Well, the Eucharist, as we
call it in Catholic theology,

384
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,923
the Holy Communion is the
sharing of the bread and wine

385
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,392
that for some is the
body and blood of Christ,

386
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,528
for others represents the
body and blood of Christ.

387
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:03,696
No matter what you call...
what words you use,

388
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,231
it's essential to Catholicism.

389
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,234
The power of the Eucharist

390
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,770
is what the Church
has held over people,

391
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,773
that "I, as an ordained
person with an indelible mark,

392
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,475
"can make Holy Communion

393
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,311
"is what separates
you from me,

394
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:19,612
"what separates me

395
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,314
from the average person
going down the street."

396
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,550
And if you think of, you know,

397
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,352
the earliest church communities,

398
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,921
it wasn't controlled
by the clergy.

399
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,155
It was breaking of bread

400
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,124
and passed around
to believing people

401
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:33,493
as a symbol of
Christ's presence...

402
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,228
spiritual presence among us.

403
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,364
But then it has become
controlled in many ways,

404
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:39,766
and politicized.

405
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,435
So, for instance, if you're
married and divorced

406
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,504
and remarried but
not by a priest,

407
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,638
you can't go to Communion.

408
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:49,309
If you're gay and you're not
absolutely chaste and celibate,

409
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,577
you can't go to Communion.

410
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,848
If you vote for somebody
who approves of abortion,

411
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,749
you can't go to Communion,
according to some.

412
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,020
So it's become a kind
of a politicized reward

413
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,455
for thinking the right way,

414
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:04,390
when, in effect, it's
none of the above.

415
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:08,728
I can't think of anything more
evil than a priest using his office,

416
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,264
what the Catholics
would call alter Christus,

417
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,933
when the priest raises
that host at Mass

418
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,969
and consecrates that host,

419
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,403
the priest becomes one with Christ.

420
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,072
The Catholics believe,

421
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,673
and we're all taught as little kids,

422
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,509
that it's truly Jesus Christ.

423
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,210
To take that hand,

424
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:26,946
within moments before or after that,

425
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:30,350
and place them on a child's
genitals and abuse him...

426
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,155
And I think that was part of the
terrible destruction to the child

427
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,991
that in addition to all the other...

428
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,126
consequences...
long-term consequences

429
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:42,195
of being sexually abused,

430
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:44,864
the spiritual abuse...

431
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:49,002
of being abused by embodiment

432
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,237
of the divine, if you will,

433
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:53,706
was just devastating.

434
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:01,181
I asked for a meeting
with Oliver O'Grady in '86,

435
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:04,984
and they told me, you know,
"Vengeance is wrong.

436
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,786
"He's a virtue
of priesthood now.

437
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,090
"He's in counseling.
Check your motives.

438
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,759
"God will delve out punishments.

439
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,094
You don't need to."

440
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,864
When Nancy Sloan
came to you in the '80s,

441
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:19,799
she was distressed, correct?

442
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,634
1986, was it?

443
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:24,237
Was she distressed?

444
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,673
No, she wasn't.

445
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,743
Was she just doing just fine?

446
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,480
She... The first
time I saw her

447
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,315
was that day.

448
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,952
I hadn't known
anything about her.

449
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:43,490
She seemed very composed.

450
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:44,924
He just went on and on,

451
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,227
lashing out all this guilt on me,

452
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,661
when I told him, you know,

453
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,997
I just want him to
understand the depth

454
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:53,466
of the pain that I suffer
on a regular basis,

455
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:57,670
that how, when I
see a Dodge Duster,

456
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,507
which was the car
that he drove at the time,

457
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,842
how I still pull
over and dry heave.

458
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,177
What did she want?

459
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:06,579
She wanted to know

460
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,215
whether Father O'Grady

461
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:13,153
was continuing in therapy.

462
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:15,388
What did you tell her?

463
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:18,491
I told that I would...
I thought he was,

464
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,827
but I would check
on it for sure.

465
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,629
- Was he?
- Yes.

466
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:26,433
I told him, "You knew
that I was being abused.

467
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:28,968
"You knew that the
abuse was happening.

468
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,737
How could you not
have done something?"

469
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:34,274
So Bishop Montrose knew
O'Grady was an abuser?

470
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,743
He knew that O'Grady
had been accused

471
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:41,147
of inappropriate touching in '76.

472
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:45,852
Just like every other
bishop after '76.

473
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,493
- Right?
- Yes.

474
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:56,830
And he said...

475
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,399
"We knew that you
were being abused,

476
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,000
"but you were a girl,

477
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,038
"so we thought it
was normal curiosity.

478
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,673
"Had you been a boy,

479
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,875
"we would have thought
something was wrong with it.

480
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,743
"That would have been obscene

481
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:16,282
for him to have abused
a boy, like homosexual."

482
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,955
The situation is, I'm
alone with the boy.

483
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:25,959
There wasn't anybody else
in the rectory at the time.

484
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,560
I brought him in.

485
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,729
I had been affectionate
with him before,

486
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,297
so being affectionate
again with him

487
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:35,802
wasn't that difficult a
thing to do, which I was.

488
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,971
And I remember...

489
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,106
just holding him
and hugging him

490
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,642
and probably saying
some nice things to him,

491
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:46,012
and he was responding
as well, you know.

492
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:49,682
And the thought that had
gone through my mind, actually,

493
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,352
was to...

494
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,521
take off all his clothes

495
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:58,158
and to molest him that way.

496
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:02,662
And I think I may have
taken off his T-shirt,

497
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:07,434
and then I was going
to unbuckle his pants,

498
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:08,768
and there was a feeling...

499
00:26:08,835 --> 00:26:10,904
I didn't know if
I wanted to go...

500
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,839
There was a conflict
in my mind about,

501
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,808
"Do I really want to do this?

502
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,610
"Here's somebody that I like.

503
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:21,514
"Here's somebody that I respect,

504
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:23,316
"a family I respect.

505
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:27,554
What would he feel
like at the end of this?"

506
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,122
Yet, at the other side,

507
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:34,194
there was urges within
me to be sexual with him,

508
00:26:34,294 --> 00:26:36,863
and this is an opportunity
to be sexual with him,

509
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,933
because I wouldn't have
this opportunity again

510
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:42,602
God knows when.

511
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:48,007
And so I decided not to
be affectionate with him,

512
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:52,445
and yet later, I brought him
back into my bedroom again,

513
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:57,550
and I did unbutton his pants,

514
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,918
take out his penis,

515
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,788
and I began to masturbate
him at that time.

516
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,056
And...

517
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,361
I think what I...
In doing that,

518
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:09,996
I'm not too sure what
he was feeling with all...

519
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,198
I think, looking at his face

520
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:15,135
kind of told me that he was...

521
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:18,104
a little uneasy about this.

522
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:22,208
I thought at one point he
was going to cry, you know.

523
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,444
One of the few times it
had ever happened to me,

524
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,746
I had an orgasm myself...

525
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,583
without him touching me,

526
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:33,319
and I think that ended
it right there and then.

527
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,157
So I just tidied him up, and...

528
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:41,661
perhaps I took care of myself,
too, in the bathroom alone,

529
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,697
but I tidied him up
and put on his T-shirt,

530
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:47,634
and then I made a decision
right there and then.

531
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,336
I was not going to do
that again to this boy.

532
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:03,550
There's Ireland.

533
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:05,718
Yeah.

534
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:06,853
He went with us.

535
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,054
Yeah.

536
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,722
There he is with
Grandma and Grandpa.

537
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,724
- That's right. That's you.
- Yep.

538
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,761
- You're standing there.
- Behind the car.

539
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:15,895
Yeah.

540
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,600
- That's your Communion picture.
- Yep.

541
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,202
With Mahony.

542
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:33,012
I'm angry at Mahony

543
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,952
for claiming that he had absolutely
no knowledge of this pedophile

544
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,021
who had a file, a sub-secret file,

545
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:46,693
that had pieces of evidence,
that had, you know,

546
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:50,230
a father who had...

547
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,198
the Howard father
who had come forward

548
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,300
with his concerns
about the amount of time

549
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:58,171
that his children were alone
on Oliver O'Grady's days off.

550
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,783
'76 to '84,

551
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:48,788
that's, I think, when a lot of the
Howards' situation took place,

552
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:52,225
and, you know, if I
was involved with them,

553
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,294
I was a danger to them,

554
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,829
but I would have been a
danger to others as well.

555
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:59,632
Were you concerned about
Father O'Grady's conduct

556
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:03,303
with regard to the
Howard family in 1980?

557
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,840
I called him in and told him

558
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,075
that he was to
cease and desist

559
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,811
any more conduct... contact

560
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:14,380
with Mrs. Howard or
the Howard family.

561
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:16,416
He promised to do so,

562
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,785
and I never had another report

563
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:20,720
about him and the Howards.

564
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:25,725
I visited with the bishop,
and we had a conference,

565
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,628
and I had mentioned that perhaps
I should need some counseling

566
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:31,598
to get an
understanding of this,

567
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:35,602
and the bishop kind of at that time
said, "Okay, go ahead and do that".

568
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,873
You know, I'd say, "Bless me,
Father, for I have sinned. I..."

569
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,075
Sometimes it's good
to give them a time limit

570
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:43,743
as to when your last
confession was,

571
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:46,146
and say, "Well, I'd been with
some friends of mine yesterday,

572
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,781
"and some of them
are young children,

573
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:51,317
"and I had the opportunity
to be alone with one of them,

574
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:56,556
"and I did some things such
as to touch his private parts,

575
00:30:56,623 --> 00:31:00,293
"and took occasion
to do that a few times

576
00:31:00,393 --> 00:31:02,362
"when he was alone with me,

577
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:03,630
"and...

578
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,533
"I want to confess that right now,

579
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,835
ask forgiveness and absolution."

580
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,673
If it had come to your attention

581
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,877
that Father O'Grady told
your vicar-general

582
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:21,181
that he had sexual urges
towards a 9-year-old

583
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,583
or 10-year-old or an 11-year old,

584
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:26,820
is that cause to remove
him from ministry?

585
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,856
No.

586
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,758
And the Church just moved him

587
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:35,028
to another place
where they have kids.

588
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:37,397
Why didn't they just take him out?

589
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,600
Why didn't they admit it?

590
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,270
There was no action taken

591
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,074
that would remove
him from children,

592
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:52,946
and so when you transfer him
from one place to another,

593
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,214
it's...

594
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:59,085
just a tragedy waiting to happen.

595
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:38,792
Like again, the '84 situation,
what brought it up

596
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:41,361
was, you know, I'm not
feeling right inside.

597
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:42,529
There's something not right.

598
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:44,431
I need to take care of this.

599
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:46,633
When I had mentioned it
to my counselor,

600
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:48,568
this time a professional counselor...

601
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,603
he was a layman...

602
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,239
He was very helpful, you know?

603
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:57,710
And he about pulled
the whole tablecloth

604
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,512
out from under me, you know?

605
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:02,048
And all of a sudden,

606
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:04,517
I saw this massive...

607
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,685
problem, you know,

608
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:08,555
that I had,

609
00:33:08,588 --> 00:33:12,392
these tendencies that I had,

610
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:14,494
and this vale of destruction

611
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:17,197
that I had created
as a result of that.

612
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:19,666
And that was very frightening,

613
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:23,236
very difficult to comprehend,

614
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:25,371
and even to want to comprehend

615
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,140
at that particular time

616
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,809
that that was going on.

617
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:33,279
But that's what he did
when he confronted me,

618
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:38,017
and said, "I need
to report this",

619
00:33:38,051 --> 00:33:40,954
and he meant report it
to the authorities...

620
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,789
police department...

621
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:44,457
and that really scared me, you know?

622
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:45,759
That really woke me up.

623
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:00,707
My counselor suggested

624
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:05,845
that I now talk
to the bishop's office.

625
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:07,447
Well, I'm aware right now

626
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:10,683
that a personnel file
is kept on each person,

627
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,519
so I would tend to think that,

628
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,554
knowing Mahony as he is,

629
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:16,456
that he would have
gone through all those

630
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:18,458
and would have seen any references

631
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:20,393
that would have been in the file

632
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,197
regarding the 1973
and 1976 issues,

633
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,865
and that, I think,
should have told him

634
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:29,235
that there was, you know,
not just a one-shot deal,

635
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:32,472
but there was at least
two prior situations

636
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:34,207
that needed to be dealt with.

637
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,476
I should have been removed...

638
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:40,380
and attended to,

639
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,116
and he should also,
then, have followed up

640
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:46,653
by attending to the
people that I harmed.

641
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:48,955
I'd like if he had done that.

642
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,658
I'd like if all of the
bishops had done that.

643
00:34:53,026 --> 00:34:55,161
Now, I didn't talk to
Mahony right away.

644
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:59,632
I think I talked to the other monsignor
that was there, Monsignor Cain.

645
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,837
Did you think it
was important in 1984

646
00:35:03,903 --> 00:35:07,440
that the Stockton
Police Department

647
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:13,313
be advised not only
of the information

648
00:35:13,346 --> 00:35:14,848
concerning young Mr. Howard,

649
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:16,449
but also that there had been

650
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:20,954
a prior allegation by
Nancy Sloan's family

651
00:35:21,054 --> 00:35:24,224
of inappropriate touching?

652
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:25,258
No.

653
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:27,360
Well, how would they uncover

654
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,329
what happened to Nancy Sloan,

655
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:32,098
unless someone from
the diocese told them?

656
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,399
They wouldn't,

657
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,969
and at the time,

658
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:38,037
the two just were not related.

659
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:40,840
They just didn't coordinate.

660
00:35:40,907 --> 00:35:43,276
What do you mean when you
say they weren't related,

661
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,577
they didn't coordinate?

662
00:35:44,677 --> 00:35:46,813
Well, at the time of...

663
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:49,749
that he came in in '84

664
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:52,385
to talk about this incident,

665
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:54,487
certainly...

666
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,792
I knew the one in '76 took place,

667
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,994
but I didn't put
the two together.

668
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,829
One was a girl.

669
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:04,998
It was inappropriate touching.

670
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:07,801
The other was a boy, he said,

671
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:11,571
so I just didn't hook
them up in my own mind.

672
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:13,406
Monsignor Cain then suggested

673
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,275
I talk to the diocesan attorney.

674
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:17,010
Oh, it was very difficult, yeah,

675
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:19,746
because I was,
you know, kind of...

676
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:22,015
you know that kind
of unknowing thing?

677
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,751
I could be arrested.

678
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,453
Where could I end up, you know?

679
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,755
This could be...

680
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:30,023
What will my family think?

681
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,991
What will anybody think

682
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:33,760
when this happens, you know?

683
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:36,596
Mahony did call me. He was
out of town with some meeting.

684
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:37,997
I can't remember where.

685
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:40,600
But when he did get
back, he did talk to me.

686
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,835
I remember saying to him,

687
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:43,036
I said, "You know, Bishop,

688
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:45,672
this whole thing has been
going on for the past"...

689
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:48,875
and I'd been keeping
a record of the days...

690
00:36:48,908 --> 00:36:50,376
"40 days."

691
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:52,712
It was, like, actually 40 days.

692
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:54,114
I said, "It's"...

693
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,383
I said, "It's been a real
desert experience for me",

694
00:36:57,484 --> 00:36:59,786
using an analogy
from the Scripture

695
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:03,790
and, you know, the whole "40
years in the desert" type of thing.

696
00:37:05,158 --> 00:37:07,894
I said, "It's been a real Lenten
experience for me, I guess",

697
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:09,729
I said, "even outside of Lent".

698
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:12,399
And he was very
supportive, you know.

699
00:37:12,465 --> 00:37:13,833
He was very compassionate.

700
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,168
I felt at the time...

701
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:16,302
I think he was merely calling

702
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,239
to check how I was doing,

703
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:20,673
because he obviously knew

704
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:22,842
I had been very stressed
out over the situation,

705
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:24,477
and I told him that, you know.

706
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:29,416
And he got back to me.
He said, "This is where we are:

707
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:32,886
"No charge is being filed,
but we are moving you on,

708
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:36,589
and here's a couple of other
parts to the package deal."

709
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:39,459
The bishop, the attorneys,
and the police department

710
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,394
decided that maybe it was best

711
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:45,231
to move me on to another situation
out of the particular county

712
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:47,634
in which these charges will be filed,

713
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:50,136
and then to...

714
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:52,705
they'll let me take care
of the business there.

715
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:58,078
And Mahony's people
promised the police

716
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,914
that he would never
have another parish,

717
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:02,982
that he wouldn't be around kids,

718
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,517
and they'd take care of it.

719
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:09,956
In the Vatican Ecclesiastical system,

720
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:12,092
there's this term that's used.

721
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:13,526
<i>It's called bella figura.</i>

722
00:38:13,593 --> 00:38:14,761
It's an Italian word

723
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:18,231
which means good
impression, good image.

724
00:38:18,331 --> 00:38:22,635
One of the aspects,
one of the factors

725
00:38:22,702 --> 00:38:25,105
in a man being successful
in the Church

726
00:38:25,205 --> 00:38:27,107
is that he create a good image,

727
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:29,876
and that's what Roger was
very much concerned about,

728
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,678
that there be this image

729
00:38:31,745 --> 00:38:35,248
of a very upright, loyal,
orthodox bishop,

730
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,717
soon to become
archbishop hopefully,

731
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,120
because he would be the
only choice for the pope

732
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,755
to be the archbishop of Los Angeles.

733
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:44,424
And the thing he had to do, then,

734
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:48,862
was to take O'Grady,
to avoid scandal,

735
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:53,333
and any scrutiny
on him in particular,

736
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,070
was to move him
to an outlying parish

737
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,441
far away from where the police
would have jurisdiction,

738
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:03,810
which was in Stockton at the time,

739
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,879
and move him out to San Andreas...

740
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:07,714
St. Andrew's in San Andreas...

741
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:09,916
way out there in the hinterland,

742
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,117
and put him out there

743
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,720
in a very quiet
little bucolic setting,

744
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:17,056
where there was no other supervisor,
just O'Grady,

745
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:18,658
and nobody would know,

746
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:20,727
and the police wouldn't know,

747
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:22,395
the public wouldn't know,

748
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:25,331
the parishioners and the victims
over there wouldn't know,

749
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:26,800
and Rome wouldn't know.

750
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:29,269
I'd taken the depositions

751
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,772
of cardinals, archbishops,
and bishops across this country

752
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,841
for 23 years,

753
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:38,778
and what I've
encountered is deception,

754
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:41,414
perjury, denial, and deceit

755
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:43,950
at the highest levels
of the Catholic Church.

756
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,986
Somebody has represented
to the police,

757
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,856
in the middle of their
active investigation,

758
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:53,059
that they are going to transfer
O'Grady out of the parish...

759
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:57,263
That he will be working
only with adults

760
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:58,631
and away from children,

761
00:39:58,698 --> 00:40:01,034
and Monsignor Cain has denied

762
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,570
that he was possessed
of that knowledge.

763
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:04,771
Under oath.

764
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:08,875
You were the captain of the ship,

765
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:10,076
the bishop of the diocese,

766
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,778
the ordinary in charge.

767
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:15,782
Who else, if you weren't
possessed of this knowledge

768
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:19,619
and Monsignor Cain wasn't
possessed of this knowledge,

769
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,654
do you think could have been,

770
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,957
knowing the way
the diocese works

771
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:27,794
or at least worked in 1984?

772
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:30,363
I just have no idea of knowing.

773
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:31,564
I don't know.

774
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:37,637
I know that Monsignor Cain
knew that last sentence existed,

775
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,839
he certainly would
have said something.

776
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:42,442
He would not have
just let us go ahead

777
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,310
and move him to San Andreas.

778
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:45,678
I know that.

779
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:47,247
So I don't know who...

780
00:40:47,313 --> 00:40:50,049
When they say
"This unit was advised",

781
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:53,720
I don't know who
they're referring to.

782
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,188
I have no idea.

783
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,813
To quote the cardinal's
appointment letter, he put him in

784
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:23,283
"full care of the souls of
that parish in California."

785
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,218
This... it would have
been the first time

786
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,720
that I had the total
responsibility for a parish.

787
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:29,956
Up to that time,
I was an associate.

788
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:34,194
It was again working out
in a nice, nice way for him

789
00:41:34,227 --> 00:41:38,865
that another situation had
been smoothly handled.

790
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:43,937
Do you remember receiving this
letter from Father O'Grady?

791
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,239
I don't remember it, but I recall...

792
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:49,175
You know, you showed it to
me. I presume I received it.

793
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:50,844
Okay. Next sentence states,

794
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:54,781
"I would like to write to you
as one of the first persons

795
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,751
to whom I owe a great
deal of gratitude."

796
00:41:59,085 --> 00:42:00,086
Period.

797
00:42:00,153 --> 00:42:02,222
"I sincerely thank you

798
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:04,224
"for all that you have done for me

799
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:06,760
in the past few months."

800
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,964
What did you think he
was referring to there

801
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,733
when he made that statement?

802
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:19,172
Nothing in particular. I thought
this was a overly effusive letter.

803
00:42:19,272 --> 00:42:21,241
I didn't really have
that much relations...

804
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:22,776
personal
relationship with him.

805
00:42:22,842 --> 00:42:25,745
He was not a priest
that I would golf with

806
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:27,514
or have dinner with
or anything else,

807
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:29,983
so he was, I think,

808
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,786
quite flowery and
effusive, basically.

809
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,320
I honestly don't know.

810
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:35,755
As I say, when I first...

811
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:37,056
when I saw this again,

812
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,059
and I suspect the
time when I got it,

813
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:42,829
it's just an overly
effusive letter

814
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:43,997
that...

815
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:47,467
Next paragraph states, quote,

816
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:50,036
"I am particularly grateful to you

817
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:54,007
for your sensitivity to me
and my needs at this time."

818
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:56,843
What did you think
he referred to there?

819
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,646
I don't remember.

820
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:01,281
Really, as I say,

821
00:43:01,347 --> 00:43:05,385
I just found the whole
letter terribly overstated,

822
00:43:05,485 --> 00:43:07,287
and I imagine at the time

823
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:11,091
I read it cursorily
and filed it after...

824
00:43:11,157 --> 00:43:12,258
It probably would have then...

825
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:13,960
I didn't answer
it for some time.

826
00:43:14,027 --> 00:43:16,396
I didn't feel it was...

827
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,832
it was important or...

828
00:43:18,898 --> 00:43:20,633
I have no idea.

829
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,837
At this point, looking
back at this 12 years ago,

830
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,506
I can't remember what I
thought when I read this letter.

831
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:28,641
When I read this,
I was just very puzzled.

832
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:31,010
I couldn't imagine what
he was referring to.

833
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,412
I just didn't...

834
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,948
I personally didn't pay
that much attention to it.

835
00:43:34,981 --> 00:43:38,218
You'll notice I didn't answer it
till almost three weeks later.

836
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:02,709
What Cardinal Mahony did is,
he picked his own career,

837
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:08,581
and he picked power and
glory over the children.

838
00:44:08,648 --> 00:44:10,250
It's like the scene in the Gospel

839
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,752
where it says that
Satan took Christ

840
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:15,055
to the top of a mountain,

841
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,223
and showed Him all
the cities of the world

842
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,892
and all the glory
over the world,

843
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:19,993
and said, "This
all can be yours

844
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:22,529
if you'll just sit and bow
down and worship me".

845
00:44:22,562 --> 00:44:24,330
I think that's what
Cardinal Mahony did.

846
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:28,401
It was the only thing he
could do to keep his status,

847
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:32,572
and ultimately be exalted
to cardinal as he was,

848
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,942
not two years later.

849
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:53,093
To be married in the Church,
the Catholic Church,

850
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:55,929
you go through a
series of classes

851
00:44:55,995 --> 00:44:58,665
with the priest that
you're dealing with.

852
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:01,868
In our case, it
was Oliver O'Grady.

853
00:45:02,368 --> 00:45:03,870
Those classes,

854
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:05,371
from what I've heard now,

855
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:08,641
run between six
and seven weeks,

856
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:11,611
or six or seven sessions.

857
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:14,681
My wife and I went
in for our classes.

858
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:18,017
We met with the...
with O'Grady one time.

859
00:45:18,084 --> 00:45:20,754
He found out that I
was in law enforcement,

860
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,323
and determined
that we did not need

861
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,259
any more further
marital training,

862
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:28,328
and signed us off,

863
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:30,797
and we were able to get
married in the Catholic Church

864
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,868
with Oliver O'Grady
presiding at our wedding.

865
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:37,570
And he was the priest

866
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:41,274
for one of the churches that
encompassed half the county,

867
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:46,713
so he played a major role
in a lot of people's lives,

868
00:45:46,813 --> 00:45:49,282
a lot of families in
Calaveras County.

869
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:53,453
He's admitted that he spent
as much time grooming victims

870
00:45:53,553 --> 00:45:55,188
as he did being a priest,

871
00:45:55,288 --> 00:45:57,791
and he was a priest
for over 30 years,

872
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:03,496
spending every waking hour
planning abuse, executing abuse,

873
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:05,198
thinking about abuse.

874
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:09,369
So 365 days a year times 30.

875
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:10,970
He has so many victims,

876
00:46:11,037 --> 00:46:12,772
I don't think he can keep track,

877
00:46:12,872 --> 00:46:15,008
and I think it's in the hundreds.

878
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:21,214
How young are
the molested kids?

879
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:23,383
One's what, three
months, nine months?

880
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:25,418
That was his youngest victim.

881
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:26,419
Right.

882
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:27,454
You know, nine months.

883
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,955
nine months.

884
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:30,724
To abuse an infant,

885
00:46:30,824 --> 00:46:31,958
I mean, you really...

886
00:46:32,025 --> 00:46:33,893
Part of what people have to do

887
00:46:33,993 --> 00:46:35,161
when they're talking about this...

888
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,296
and it's so hard,

889
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:37,997
and no one wants to do it...

890
00:46:38,031 --> 00:46:40,600
is to really try to walk through

891
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:45,472
and picture a grown man

892
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:51,511
inserting... forcing his penis
into the vagina of a baby.

893
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:53,279
Oliver, have you
ever been diagnosed

894
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:55,982
with a disassociative disorder?

895
00:46:56,082 --> 00:46:58,351
I'm sure I fit the category

896
00:46:58,418 --> 00:46:59,853
of a lot of disorders.

897
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:01,888
Whatever they are,

898
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:03,456
you name that, I'll jump.

899
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,091
I'm not trying to be flippant here.

900
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:06,993
And I am. I'm sorry.

901
00:47:07,026 --> 00:47:09,129
That's okay, but what
I'm trying to say is,

902
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:11,030
has anybody ever told you

903
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:14,334
you may disassociate
from events?

904
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,969
I'm sure they have.

905
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:17,103
Okay.

906
00:47:17,203 --> 00:47:18,471
Is it...

907
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:21,541
I mean, to me, as a lay person,

908
00:47:21,608 --> 00:47:23,643
when you molest somebody,

909
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,078
it's sort of black and white:

910
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:26,513
either you do or you don't.

911
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:28,548
What I get from you, Oliver, is,

912
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:30,049
in some instances,

913
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,684
you're not sure if
you molested people.

914
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:32,986
Correct.

915
00:47:33,086 --> 00:47:35,488
Do you think that's
because it didn't happen,

916
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:37,357
or do you think that's because,

917
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:39,926
either to deal with
the trauma yourself,

918
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:42,529
or to justify it or deal with guilt,

919
00:47:42,562 --> 00:47:44,898
whatever the
malady you had was,

920
00:47:44,964 --> 00:47:46,833
do you maybe be disassociating

921
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:49,035
from the reality of
what actually occurred?

922
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:51,938
- I think that would be accurate, yes.
- Okay.

923
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:54,074
He's a very dangerous man,

924
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:59,913
and an aggressive,
assaultive person,

925
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:02,749
who apparently would do anything

926
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:04,150
to get to his victims,

927
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,986
including having sex
with their parents.

928
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:28,241
When I was little, I was
always talking to everybody.

929
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:32,879
And I feel like I had a lot of...

930
00:48:32,946 --> 00:48:36,149
more hope in me than doubt.

931
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:39,319
I'm sure you could ask all
my teachers, and they'd go,

932
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:45,191
"Yeah. Smart guy. I don't
know what happened to him."

933
00:48:51,364 --> 00:48:54,901
O'Grady saw an easy mark in us

934
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:56,336
because we're brought up...

935
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:58,271
I was brought up Catholic,

936
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:02,876
so automatically you see
a guy with a collar on,

937
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:05,078
you automatically trust him.

938
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:07,280
So he moved right in,

939
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:11,985
and Becky fell
hook, line and sinker.

940
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:14,521
You know, he was the wolf,

941
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:16,122
and I was the gatekeeper,

942
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:18,358
and I let the wolf
through the gate.

943
00:49:18,425 --> 00:49:21,761
That's what it's always
felt like to me, you know?

944
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:23,797
And to know that
you could be...

945
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,633
that I could be so wrong.

946
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:31,137
I mean, how wrong
could I have been?

947
00:49:31,204 --> 00:49:33,907
I mean, to be so
horribly wrong...

948
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:38,244
was absolutely devastating.

949
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:42,048
His whole thing,
he would get into the family

950
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:45,118
more than just with
the children, you know,

951
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:49,122
so my mom had been
involved with him,

952
00:49:49,222 --> 00:49:51,357
and I think that was the...

953
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:54,227
that was the killer
one there, you know?

954
00:49:56,229 --> 00:49:57,630
And early on I...

955
00:49:57,697 --> 00:50:00,467
I realized early on that
there was something wrong,

956
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:05,705
but my upbringing told me,
nah, that can't happen.

957
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:09,876
I talk with a lot of, like,
female survivors,

958
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:12,712
and they talk about,
like, little games

959
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:16,483
to sort of... segue toward it,

960
00:50:16,583 --> 00:50:18,385
but with... it wasn't
like that with me.

961
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:20,920
He just started in.

962
00:50:20,987 --> 00:50:22,222
He started right in:

963
00:50:22,322 --> 00:50:26,493
grabbing me, touching me,
making me touch him...

964
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,063
telling me that... why would
my folks have brought me here

965
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:32,165
if they didn't think it was okay?

966
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:35,201
Why would they even
have thought that?

967
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:37,303
Those are the things that he said.

968
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:49,115
I failed them once,
and it was huge,

969
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,951
and I'll never do it again.

970
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:54,954
That will never happen again.

971
00:50:55,021 --> 00:50:57,257
I will not ever...

972
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:00,593
I will never fail them again.

973
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:04,464
I was trimming those
bushes, right there,

974
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:06,833
those little bushes,

975
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:08,735
the first time it happened.

976
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:10,470
I went into the house to eat lunch,

977
00:51:10,537 --> 00:51:16,309
and then he just came
in and closed the door,

978
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:20,480
and he just held me down,
held my head down,

979
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:23,817
and he fucking sodomized
me right in there.

980
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,151
Right there.

981
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,856
That's not easy
to say, you know.

982
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:34,360
Fuck, for years I
never even spoke of it,

983
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:38,198
and every time I'd
get close to a girl,

984
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:41,067
or every time I'd...

985
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:43,336
feel like something
was done wrong to me,

986
00:51:43,436 --> 00:51:45,872
I'd go right there.

987
00:51:45,905 --> 00:51:48,341
It would just go in
the bin with it, you know?

988
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,344
That's the kind of...
That's what this shit does.

989
00:51:51,444 --> 00:51:55,181
It doesn't just hurt you.

990
00:51:55,315 --> 00:51:57,851
In July of 1993, we had a family

991
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:00,487
that contacted the Calaveras County
Sheriff's Department

992
00:52:00,587 --> 00:52:06,025
to report that a priest in San
Andreas in Calaveras County

993
00:52:06,092 --> 00:52:08,395
was molesting members of the family,

994
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:11,698
specifically two young boys
in the family.

995
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:15,201
So the next day he called me,

996
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:17,404
and he said he was having a problem

997
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:19,038
and he was away from the parish.

998
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:23,710
And I knew, just talking to him,
that there was something wrong.

999
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:25,545
Then we told him
we would help him.

1000
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:28,481
I said, "If you didn't do any
of these things to children,

1001
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:30,216
"you have no problem.

1002
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:33,219
There's no way anybody
can accuse you of..."

1003
00:52:33,286 --> 00:52:36,556
Even the word molestation
never even entered my mind.

1004
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:38,224
It was just touching.

1005
00:52:38,324 --> 00:52:39,759
I said, "If you didn't
touch these kids

1006
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:43,363
"in an inappropriate way
or touched them sexually,

1007
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:44,898
"you don't have anything
to worry about.

1008
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:46,433
You don't have a record."

1009
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:50,036
Then he said, Well, I had
a problem nine years ago."

1010
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,604
When we started
our investigation,

1011
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:56,276
we found out that this had
not been the first incident

1012
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:58,745
that he had been involved in.

1013
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:02,248
Going back as far as the mid-'70s

1014
00:53:02,348 --> 00:53:07,153
he had been involved
with molesting children.

1015
00:53:09,856 --> 00:53:12,192
It appeared that...

1016
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:17,430
to us that there was a lot
of knowledge about that

1017
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,265
outside of our community

1018
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:22,235
but none of that
information had reached us.

1019
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:25,105
At that point we
were supporting him.

1020
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:27,107
Yeah.

1021
00:53:27,173 --> 00:53:31,277
Then he was concerned
about his family and stuff.

1022
00:53:31,344 --> 00:53:33,113
So I talked to his
family in Ireland,

1023
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:35,949
and told them that
we would support him

1024
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:38,718
and make sure he got represented
and everything like that.

1025
00:53:38,785 --> 00:53:42,322
At that point we obtained
arrest warrants for Oliver O'Grady

1026
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:46,626
for multiple counts of lewd
and lascivious acts with minors.

1027
00:53:46,693 --> 00:53:50,997
We served search warrants at
the parish here in San Andreas,

1028
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:55,001
the rectory here in San Andreas,

1029
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:57,303
the diocese in Stockton,

1030
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:00,673
and in law offices...
Not law offices,

1031
00:54:00,707 --> 00:54:04,310
but the offices of Cardinal
Mahony in Los Angeles.

1032
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,647
Then when he asked for the
bail money, Bob went and got it.

1033
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,682
I went to work Monday morning...

1034
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:11,151
And I did.

1035
00:54:11,217 --> 00:54:15,822
And everybody at work
knew who he was.

1036
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:18,525
They knew he was my friend.

1037
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:19,492
The newspapers had...

1038
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:21,127
It was kind of quiet.

1039
00:54:21,227 --> 00:54:22,996
I remember saying,
"What's the matter with you guys?

1040
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:26,499
How come you're all acting
this way this morning?"

1041
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,268
They said,
"Did you read the paper?"

1042
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:30,336
I said, "No, I haven't had
time to read the paper yet.

1043
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:31,905
Yeah.

1044
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:34,874
It was exploded all over the
front page of the newspaper.

1045
00:54:35,842 --> 00:54:39,345
I said, "There's no way
Ollie would touch our kids".

1046
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,715
We didn't suspect.
We didn't see anything.

1047
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:43,016
Just no way.

1048
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,551
Then I called Bob at work

1049
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:48,021
and told him what I saw
in the paper and everything.

1050
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:51,191
I said... And he said
the same thing to me.

1051
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,392
He said, "No way.

1052
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,528
There's no way he
would touch our kids."

1053
00:54:55,628 --> 00:55:01,568
Then it was almost like
the fear of God got in me.

1054
00:55:01,601 --> 00:55:03,536
I told... He said, "Well,
we have to ask them".

1055
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:05,071
But then we went...

1056
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:07,374
I called her and I said,

1057
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,042
"Ann, did you see the paper?

1058
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:12,545
Did you read about
Father Ollie in the paper?"

1059
00:55:12,612 --> 00:55:17,217
She said she didn't
watch the news or something.

1060
00:55:17,283 --> 00:55:21,921
I said, "There's all these
allegations against him".

1061
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:25,892
The boys from...
It was the Howard kids at that time.

1062
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,561
And...

1063
00:55:28,628 --> 00:55:30,563
I was... When I said it to her

1064
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,067
I was expecting a response
like "Who's doing this?"

1065
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:37,904
And it was nothing.
It was just absolute silence.

1066
00:55:38,004 --> 00:55:39,606
Then I said to her... I said,

1067
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:41,074
"Ann, I have to ask you."

1068
00:55:41,107 --> 00:55:43,777
I said, "Did he ever touch you
when you were a little girl?"

1069
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,912
And she... "I got to go, Mom.

1070
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:47,680
I got to take care of the dog."

1071
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:50,583
I just knew right then.

1072
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:53,586
I just felt it.

1073
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:54,687
She still wouldn't answer.

1074
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,656
I said, "Bob, you
have to call her".

1075
00:55:56,756 --> 00:56:00,260
I knew she wouldn't lie to Bob.

1076
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:01,428
So I asked her.

1077
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:02,962
She called him.

1078
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:05,765
You called her.

1079
00:56:05,832 --> 00:56:10,403
I asked her if he had molested you.

1080
00:56:10,503 --> 00:56:11,805
You said,
"Did he ever touch you?"

1081
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:14,407
Yeah.
"Did he ever touch..."

1082
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:17,444
And she said yes.

1083
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:21,614
And the whole world collapsed.

1084
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:22,849
I could hear him crying.

1085
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:24,984
I could hear Ann crying
on the other side...

1086
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:28,621
I gave her back the phone, and...

1087
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:33,193
She came over, and
Case DeGroot came over.

1088
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:37,764
At that point, it
destroyed our lives.

1089
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:39,299
From that day on it just...

1090
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:40,834
Destroyed our family.

1091
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:41,901
Everything.

1092
00:56:42,001 --> 00:56:44,804
Then it's like you
have flashbacks.

1093
00:56:44,871 --> 00:56:46,005
Why didn't I see this?

1094
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:47,307
Why didn't I see that?

1095
00:56:47,374 --> 00:56:48,308
Right.

1096
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,310
It was like...

1097
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:51,478
It was terrible.

1098
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:54,047
I kind of handed Ann
over to this bastard

1099
00:56:54,114 --> 00:56:56,549
on a silver platter, just about.

1100
00:56:57,384 --> 00:56:58,518
How did he do it?

1101
00:56:58,551 --> 00:56:59,586
He just destroyed...

1102
00:56:59,652 --> 00:57:01,855
How did we get fooled
by him so much?

1103
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:03,923
I used to go to work
and he'd be here

1104
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:07,827
saying his morning prayers.

1105
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:09,362
Had the Bible in his hand,

1106
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,830
and he's saying morning prayers.

1107
00:57:10,897 --> 00:57:13,366
I said, "Good morning, Ollie".

1108
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:16,336
Then he'd be in there at
nighttime molesting Ann.

1109
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:20,006
And during the night he's
molesting my daughter.

1110
00:57:20,073 --> 00:57:21,041
Raping her!

1111
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:24,010
Not molesting her!
Raping her!

1112
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,346
At five years old!

1113
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:29,182
God's sakes!

1114
00:57:29,249 --> 00:57:31,317
How could that happen?

1115
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,121
But that's what he did.

1116
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:46,399
It's futile to ask the question,
"How can this be?

1117
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,001
Why does this happen?"

1118
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:50,236
The system, the monarchical,

1119
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:53,239
hierarchical
governmental system

1120
00:57:53,273 --> 00:57:56,042
that the people in charge
of the Roman Catholic Church

1121
00:57:56,109 --> 00:58:01,915
from the Pope on down firmly
believe was willed by almighty God

1122
00:58:01,948 --> 00:58:06,753
is the reason why Roger
Mahony is believed to be

1123
00:58:06,753 --> 00:58:09,889
substantially more
important and better

1124
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:14,394
than the children who were
ravished by Oliver O'Grady.

1125
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:18,064
My father won't walk
me down the aisle

1126
00:58:18,131 --> 00:58:20,767
because he can't
step in the church.

1127
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:23,069
He's taken my wedding
away from me,

1128
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:24,738
everything in the future.

1129
00:58:24,804 --> 00:58:30,076
I constantly am battling
to regain my life back.

1130
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:31,745
Constantly.

1131
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:34,748
I have never
conceived a child.

1132
00:58:34,848 --> 00:58:36,750
I'm not married.

1133
00:58:36,816 --> 00:58:40,120
I'm 40 years old, almost.

1134
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:41,421
I'm 39.

1135
00:58:41,488 --> 00:58:43,623
I'm approaching 40 and...

1136
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:47,160
it's still not over.

1137
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:49,095
When did it stop?
When she was 13?

1138
00:58:49,162 --> 00:58:51,097
- 12.
- 12, okay.

1139
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:56,669
And I asked her, "Why didn't
you tell us earlier? Why?"

1140
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:02,442
And her answer was to me

1141
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:07,947
that I used to say that
anybody who tried to hurt you,

1142
00:59:08,014 --> 00:59:10,784
I would kill him!

1143
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,185
And...

1144
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:15,889
I shouldn't have
made that statement.

1145
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:16,956
She told me that...

1146
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:19,793
She wouldn't say anything!

1147
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,795
She asked a little girl
what would happen

1148
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:24,297
if your Dad killed somebody,

1149
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:26,433
and they said that he would
go to jail forever and ever

1150
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:28,468
and never come out.

1151
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:32,305
She said that day I decided
I could never tell anybody

1152
00:59:32,372 --> 00:59:35,408
because she said,
"I knew Dad would kill him".

1153
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:40,313
It guess her love for me
kept her from telling me.

1154
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:44,350
And my love for her...

1155
00:59:44,384 --> 00:59:48,154
I feel guilty about that,

1156
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:52,192
but I feel betrayed
by the Church.

1157
00:59:52,225 --> 00:59:57,330
The Church had betrayed
me and my family!

1158
00:59:57,430 --> 00:59:59,999
They destroyed it.

1159
01:00:00,033 --> 01:00:03,403
By golly, I'm not going
to let it destroy me now.

1160
01:00:04,437 --> 01:00:07,507
My name is Tom Doyle.

1161
01:00:07,574 --> 01:00:11,678
I've been a Catholic
priest for 35 years.

1162
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:14,347
I've been fired from
two major positions

1163
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:20,186
and sidetracked from two
careers as a priest in the Church

1164
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:25,024
because I've openly
advocated for the victims

1165
01:00:25,091 --> 01:00:28,361
of clergy sexual abuse,

1166
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:29,496
and according to some,

1167
01:00:29,596 --> 01:00:32,999
been much too critical
and much too vocal

1168
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:36,202
about the source
of the cover-up:

1169
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:40,373
the manipulation,
the dishonesty

1170
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:41,641
that comes from the top.

1171
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:44,377
When we were serving
the search warrants,

1172
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:47,213
the members of the Church
that were responsible

1173
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:52,519
for keeping those records
threw up a lot of roadblocks

1174
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,221
in having to contact
their attorneys

1175
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:58,091
to find out what
they had to give to us.

1176
01:00:58,191 --> 01:01:03,363
Your duties as chancellor encompass
the entire diocese, correct?

1177
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:04,431
Yes.

1178
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:06,232
If a child had
been sexually abused

1179
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:07,667
during those years,

1180
01:01:07,734 --> 01:01:09,569
is it fair to say that that would
have come to your attention

1181
01:01:09,636 --> 01:01:13,440
as chancellor and/or vicar-general
and/or auxiliary bishop?

1182
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:15,742
Calls for speculation.

1183
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:17,410
During which years?

1184
01:01:17,477 --> 01:01:20,280
When you were an officer
of the Diocese of Fresno

1185
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:21,581
in any of those three offices.

1186
01:01:21,648 --> 01:01:26,419
Object to the term
"officer of the diocese".

1187
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,520
Go ahead.

1188
01:01:30,824 --> 01:01:34,260
I imagine I would have become
aware of that during that time.

1189
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:39,265
Your testimony is that
no such event occurred?

1190
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:42,102
No, my testimony is
I cannot recall

1191
01:01:42,202 --> 01:01:44,104
something like that
occurring during that time.

1192
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,941
Do you think if a child were raped
during your tenure at Fresno

1193
01:01:48,007 --> 01:01:50,443
that that would be something
that you would forget?

1194
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:54,347
Object. Argumentative.
Harassing.

1195
01:01:54,414 --> 01:01:56,116
Instruct the witness
not to answer.

1196
01:01:56,182 --> 01:02:01,621
Do you think if a child molestation
allegation had been levied, Your Eminence,

1197
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:04,791
while you were there acting
as an official of the diocese

1198
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:05,925
and it came to your attention,

1199
01:02:06,025 --> 01:02:08,628
that would be something
you would forget?

1200
01:02:08,695 --> 01:02:10,296
I'm going to object.

1201
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:14,834
Harassing. Argumentative.

1202
01:02:14,868 --> 01:02:16,469
Asked and answered.

1203
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:18,438
Instruct the witness
not to answer.

1204
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:19,973
He hasn't answered
that question.

1205
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,375
Yes, he has.

1206
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:24,811
When the diocese was
relating to the police,

1207
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:26,446
and they didn't
disclose the fact

1208
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:29,149
that O'Grady had been
previously accused,

1209
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:33,153
do you think they were
telling the whole truth?

1210
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:34,721
Repeat that please.

1211
01:02:34,821 --> 01:02:39,092
In '84, when the diocese was
talking to the police, okay?

1212
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:42,128
The diocese did not talk
to the police in '84.

1213
01:02:42,228 --> 01:02:44,497
The diocese attorney did.

1214
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:46,032
I didn't know that at the time.

1215
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:47,834
Okay.

1216
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:50,503
Do you think that somebody
should have told the cops, Father...

1217
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,338
Or Monsignor, forgive me...

1218
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:55,408
that O'Grady had been
previously accused?

1219
01:03:00,046 --> 01:03:01,881
It was in the hands of our attorney.

1220
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:04,184
Now, what should be done
or what should not be done

1221
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:06,419
would be his decision.

1222
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:13,560
So basically you left it
to your lawyer to decide

1223
01:03:13,593 --> 01:03:15,862
whether or not to tell the truth.

1224
01:03:15,962 --> 01:03:20,834
We left it to our lawyer
to work in the investigation.

1225
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:25,538
At that time, besides the
police investigation that we had,

1226
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:28,208
there was one guy that
could speak the truth

1227
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:31,044
and blow the whistle
on Roger Mahony

1228
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:33,246
having known about
Olive O'Grady for years,

1229
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:35,382
and that was Oliver O'Grady.

1230
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:39,719
The night before he was
scheduled to testify in that trial,

1231
01:03:39,786 --> 01:03:45,058
the attorneys for Roger
Mahony went to his jail cell,

1232
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:48,194
cut a deal with him,

1233
01:03:48,294 --> 01:03:50,063
a very dark deal that said,

1234
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:53,233
"Oliver, you take
the contempt citation

1235
01:03:53,299 --> 01:03:57,070
"and refuse to testify, even
though you've been ordered to,

1236
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:58,038
and we'll take care of you."

1237
01:03:58,071 --> 01:03:59,072
And they did.

1238
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,441
Does the diocese of Stockton

1239
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:03,743
or any of its representatives

1240
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:07,480
provide for any economic
support for you right now?

1241
01:04:10,116 --> 01:04:12,118
Not at the moment.

1242
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:13,653
Have they in the past?

1243
01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:19,092
Not since I left the priesthood.

1244
01:04:19,192 --> 01:04:21,928
They didn't buy you an annuity?

1245
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:23,563
I believe they did.

1246
01:04:23,663 --> 01:04:25,432
Do you get a check
from that annuity?

1247
01:04:25,498 --> 01:04:31,237
No, that will not come into effect
until I'm 65.

1248
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:33,440
Who holds that annuity?

1249
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:36,776
I believe the diocese holds it.

1250
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:38,111
Are you at all concerned, Oliver,

1251
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:40,613
that if you give testimony
that hurts the diocese

1252
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,151
that they might revoke that?

1253
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:47,320
I have a lot of concerns
about a lot of things,

1254
01:04:47,353 --> 01:04:50,423
and I guess that would
be one of them.

1255
01:04:50,523 --> 01:04:53,126
My parents don't get
a pension from the Church.

1256
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:56,363
They lost their whole
financial stability from this.

1257
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:57,464
Yeah.

1258
01:04:57,564 --> 01:05:00,467
They will never ever be the same.

1259
01:05:00,533 --> 01:05:02,435
My mother is forced into retirement.

1260
01:05:02,535 --> 01:05:05,972
My dad has to quit his job
to take care of her.

1261
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:08,141
Because of what?

1262
01:05:09,342 --> 01:05:13,146
Because of some jackass
that was running around

1263
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:14,981
juggling 50 kids at a time,

1264
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:17,650
and some raping mothers.

1265
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:21,654
He abused my parents, too.

1266
01:05:21,755 --> 01:05:24,190
The Church abused my parents, too.

1267
01:05:24,224 --> 01:05:27,660
They took our tithes,
they took our tuition money,

1268
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:30,997
and they haven't returned
any of that back to my family.

1269
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:33,166
They deserve all of that back.

1270
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:37,170
There is no excuse that you'd
paid to send your kid to school

1271
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:39,672
to get raped, you know,

1272
01:05:39,739 --> 01:05:41,641
and to be molested in the basement

1273
01:05:41,741 --> 01:05:44,511
where you're supposed
to be getting an education

1274
01:05:44,577 --> 01:05:46,513
or being called in his office

1275
01:05:46,579 --> 01:05:48,948
where he has full reign to do

1276
01:05:49,015 --> 01:05:51,718
whatever he wants to you
and send you back to class.

1277
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:57,290
This case, from the start to
finish, was less than two months.

1278
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:01,861
It was strange at the speed
in which that operated.

1279
01:06:01,928 --> 01:06:04,531
We just felt that there was
a lot of things

1280
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:08,168
that were left hanging
in this investigation,

1281
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:12,839
but because of the speed
with which it went,

1282
01:06:12,939 --> 01:06:16,543
we just weren't able to do our jobs
as effectively as we could have.

1283
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:21,081
But they were afraid that, through
the powers of civil discovery,

1284
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:23,216
the civil attorneys
were going to find out

1285
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:27,721
that the Church knew
prior to Oliver's ordination

1286
01:06:27,787 --> 01:06:29,956
that he probably offended.

1287
01:06:56,483 --> 01:07:00,754
He got to serve seven years,

1288
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:03,256
and I testified in the case
that convicted him,

1289
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:07,794
and he's over there
living the life of Reilly.

1290
01:07:07,827 --> 01:07:11,398
He's having tea and living
like a normal person.

1291
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:15,035
He doesn't even have to report
like people here do.

1292
01:07:25,478 --> 01:07:29,616
Seeing Oliver walk around loose
with kids is one thing,

1293
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:32,452
but knowing that
he was set up to do that,

1294
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:33,787
and he's allowed to do that,

1295
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:36,623
and he's going to be paid
to do that by the Church

1296
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:37,791
makes me furious.

1297
01:07:37,857 --> 01:07:40,293
I have to agree with Frank Keating.

1298
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,128
He was the former
governor of Oklahoma.

1299
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:45,965
He compared this diocese
and the cardinal

1300
01:07:46,032 --> 01:07:47,467
to La Cosa Nostra.

1301
01:07:47,534 --> 01:07:50,303
In 2002, the U.S. Conference
of Catholic Bishops

1302
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:53,139
asked former Oklahoma
governor Frank Keating

1303
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:55,008
to head a national review board

1304
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,810
to scrutinize the Catholic Church,

1305
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,278
hold bishops accountable,

1306
01:07:58,378 --> 01:08:00,814
and guide the Church in
how to prevent, report,

1307
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:03,149
and disclose sexual abuse.

1308
01:08:03,216 --> 01:08:05,819
Keating resigned after
making critical comments

1309
01:08:05,919 --> 01:08:10,123
about how some diocese,
including Los Angeles,

1310
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:13,793
were and continue to be
less than open with the public

1311
01:08:13,893 --> 01:08:16,363
and less than honest
with themselves.

1312
01:08:16,463 --> 01:08:20,500
If you take the position that you won't get
anything out of me without a subpoena,

1313
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,836
the suggestion is you
have something to hide.

1314
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:26,039
For a faith institution,
that's a terrible suggestion.

1315
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:30,677
In Los Angeles, when ordered
to produce the documentation,

1316
01:08:30,744 --> 01:08:31,811
the records...

1317
01:08:31,878 --> 01:08:34,047
Where you find the truth,
or most of the truth...

1318
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:37,884
by the District Attorney
of Los Angeles County,

1319
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,687
Cardinal Mahony's lawyers
cooked up this myth

1320
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:42,355
called "formation privilege"

1321
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:47,527
which has no basis in canon law,
civil law, history, or theology,

1322
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:51,197
that every communication between
a bishop and one of his priests

1323
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:56,636
is equal to confessional as far
as confidentiality is concerned.

1324
01:08:56,669 --> 01:08:59,372
There are a lot of
privileged communications

1325
01:08:59,472 --> 01:09:02,242
in the state of California.

1326
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:07,047
One of them is reporters
in news media of sources.

1327
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:12,385
That's a very highly protected
protection that you have.

1328
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:17,390
There are between a husband and
wife testifying against each other.

1329
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:19,225
There are a whole list of them.

1330
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:22,062
Those are protected
communications,

1331
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:24,764
and so a priest
talking to his bishop

1332
01:09:24,831 --> 01:09:26,433
is a protected communication.

1333
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:31,404
As Christian adults,

1334
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,273
Catholic, non-Catholic,

1335
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:36,743
Jewish, whatever,

1336
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:40,647
we should always be in the
business of protecting children.

1337
01:09:43,349 --> 01:09:47,721
The one thing that
always stuck with me

1338
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:53,159
that Mahony didn't...

1339
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,768
The children...

1340
01:10:01,868 --> 01:10:05,438
- He didn't protect them.
- Yeah.

1341
01:10:05,505 --> 01:10:07,507
He didn't come clean.

1342
01:10:07,574 --> 01:10:10,710
He has presided over...

1343
01:10:10,777 --> 01:10:14,114
the wholesale sexual abuse...

1344
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,250
of dozens and dozens and
dozens of children in his dioceses.

1345
01:10:17,317 --> 01:10:18,618
Let me put it this way.

1346
01:10:18,718 --> 01:10:19,953
Cardinal Mahony's argument
about the documents

1347
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:23,323
is an argument David
Koresh would love.

1348
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:27,794
Basically, if doctrine
lets you rape kids,

1349
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:32,632
I guess that makes the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles

1350
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:33,900
an official cult.

1351
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:40,807
The last place
we found O'Grady

1352
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,676
was living with a
family in Thurles

1353
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,446
in the shadow of the
seminary he'd attended

1354
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:47,981
with the full knowledge
of the bishop,

1355
01:10:48,048 --> 01:10:50,517
with the full knowledge of
the rector of the seminary,

1356
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:53,319
and the family he was
living with didn't know.

1357
01:10:53,386 --> 01:10:56,489
And the Garda, the police
in Ireland, didn't know.

1358
01:10:59,392 --> 01:11:01,494
I could say that my
life has been a failure.

1359
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:06,032
I'd like to think that I can
still make some good decisions

1360
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:11,504
and even bright future
for myself as a result.

1361
01:11:11,571 --> 01:11:14,507
So, don't always
do the right things.

1362
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:16,009
Obviously not, but...

1363
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:21,715
I think what I'm doing
right now is not alone

1364
01:11:21,748 --> 01:11:24,017
the best thing,
but I think the only thing.

1365
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:26,353
I'm thinking of writing a letter

1366
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:32,192
to each person that I have
offended sexually in the past.

1367
01:11:32,258 --> 01:11:34,361
I do want to apologize to them.

1368
01:11:34,427 --> 01:11:39,699
I am... But I don't want that
to be a simple statement.

1369
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:42,869
I think they...

1370
01:11:42,936 --> 01:11:44,371
Basically what I
want to say to them:

1371
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:45,872
It should not have happened.

1372
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:49,642
It should not have happened.

1373
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:51,044
If I could invite these people

1374
01:11:51,077 --> 01:11:54,381
to come and meet
with me one-on-one

1375
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:59,386
and give them the opportunity
to, again, talk to me,

1376
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:01,755
tell me what I did to them.

1377
01:12:01,788 --> 01:12:05,225
I need to hear that, and I
think they need to say that.

1378
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:07,060
I can't say it's hard to do this.

1379
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,762
I'm kind of happy
that I am doing it,

1380
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:13,233
but it's going to be a
very interesting reunion.

1381
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:14,934
And I really, really,

1382
01:12:15,035 --> 01:12:18,405
really, really hope they come.

1383
01:12:18,438 --> 01:12:20,907
"I'm writing this letter to you

1384
01:12:20,974 --> 01:12:23,009
"to invite you to meet with me.

1385
01:12:23,076 --> 01:12:26,579
"I would like to
apologize to you again

1386
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:30,250
"for the wrong I did to you.

1387
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:34,421
"It is my hope that this
opportunity will allow you

1388
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:37,924
"the freedom to continue
with your life

1389
01:12:37,957 --> 01:12:42,562
"knowing that I have acknowledged
my actions of the past,

1390
01:12:42,662 --> 01:12:45,999
"and hopefully enabling you

1391
01:12:46,066 --> 01:12:50,570
to continue your life in a
better way from now on."

1392
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:53,339
"I need to acknowledge
to you face-to-face

1393
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,211
that I have molested you sexually
for many years many years ago."

1394
01:12:58,278 --> 01:13:01,281
"In this way I will be able
to respond and apologize

1395
01:13:01,314 --> 01:13:03,950
to all those I have
offended in a sexual way."

1396
01:13:19,866 --> 01:13:22,435
He's a piece of crap, man.

1397
01:13:22,535 --> 01:13:25,305
He remembered
all of our names.

1398
01:13:25,372 --> 01:13:29,676
I get so angry to even
think that that guy's alive.

1399
01:13:31,544 --> 01:13:33,947
I would kill his mother.

1400
01:13:34,013 --> 01:13:36,316
I won't be quoting Scripture.

1401
01:13:36,383 --> 01:13:38,318
It won't open with a prayer,

1402
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:41,488
except if anybody wants
to, be they need a...

1403
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:44,991
It might not even close
with a prayer.

1404
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:47,494
I don't expect people to
hug me when they leave.

1405
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:48,962
I don't expect people...

1406
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:51,664
I hope they might
shake hands with me,

1407
01:13:51,731 --> 01:13:54,167
and say, "Hey, yeah,
it's over right now".

1408
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:57,003
And I let them get
on with their lives,

1409
01:13:57,037 --> 01:14:00,306
and I'm sure they'll be happy
to let me get on with mine.

1410
01:14:00,373 --> 01:14:01,841
Come on down, you know?

1411
01:14:01,908 --> 01:14:04,844
We'll have a barbe...
It's stupid.

1412
01:14:04,878 --> 01:14:07,580
What the fuck is he thinking
writing these letters?

1413
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,852
Yeah, that's what we all need.

1414
01:14:12,952 --> 01:14:15,722
To see him?
Are you kidding me?

1415
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:17,857
We don't need anything from him.

1416
01:14:17,924 --> 01:14:19,526
I want to know
what his motivation is.

1417
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:22,862
I do not want to go over there
so he can get his jollies off

1418
01:14:22,929 --> 01:14:25,999
collecting his little family
of abuse victims.

1419
01:14:26,099 --> 01:14:29,369
Yeah, his little whatever.

1420
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:31,204
My motivation of
going over there...

1421
01:14:31,237 --> 01:14:34,374
If I thought that he had
a heart at all to touch,

1422
01:14:34,441 --> 01:14:35,408
it would be different.

1423
01:14:35,508 --> 01:14:37,510
But I think he's so far gone...

1424
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:41,047
But it would be to disclose
as much as you can

1425
01:14:41,114 --> 01:14:43,550
about what you did
while you were here

1426
01:14:43,616 --> 01:14:46,219
and putting the nail
in Mahony's coffin

1427
01:14:46,286 --> 01:14:49,889
to get the truth
about what he knew.

1428
01:14:49,956 --> 01:14:52,892
Those are the people.

1429
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:54,561
Those are the letters,

1430
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:59,766
and all I can say is Godspeed.

1431
01:15:01,134 --> 01:15:03,236
I hope to see
all of you real soon.

1432
01:15:03,336 --> 01:15:08,241
I think the little girl
that's five years old

1433
01:15:08,308 --> 01:15:14,114
that's scared and afraid
of him is still afraid to go.

1434
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:18,651
And then I think,
I'm a big girl now...

1435
01:15:21,321 --> 01:15:25,291
and what I didn't have the
courage as a child to tell him...

1436
01:15:27,494 --> 01:15:30,397
it might be nice to
tell him something.

1437
01:15:32,665 --> 01:15:35,402
Healing myself wasn't going to...

1438
01:15:35,502 --> 01:15:39,105
It was never pending
on what happened to him.

1439
01:15:39,172 --> 01:15:41,941
That's... It's within
me to get better,

1440
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:45,945
not based on anything that...

1441
01:15:46,012 --> 01:15:49,983
I felt like if I was relying on...

1442
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,787
his punishment to heal myself,

1443
01:15:53,853 --> 01:15:57,590
it seems like that would
be giving too much clout

1444
01:15:57,657 --> 01:16:00,460
to the pain that I'd
gone through, you know?

1445
01:16:00,527 --> 01:16:04,297
To say that's what I am
and that's who I am...

1446
01:16:04,364 --> 01:16:07,834
That's not who I am, so...

1447
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:12,639
When you were a little boy,

1448
01:16:12,706 --> 01:16:14,708
were you ever touched
sexually by a priest?

1449
01:16:18,712 --> 01:16:19,813
Yes.

1450
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:23,650
And what was that
priest's name?

1451
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:26,286
I can't remember.

1452
01:16:26,386 --> 01:16:29,122
Do you know where it happened?

1453
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:31,358
When I was an altar boy
at St. Michael's Church,

1454
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:34,494
the event happened there.

1455
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:36,363
How many times
did it happen, Oliver?

1456
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:45,171
Not many. I'd say
two or three times.

1457
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:50,310
I think we all go through
an exploratory stage of that,

1458
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:53,847
but my older brother
did abuse me.

1459
01:16:53,913 --> 01:16:57,017
Again, I find it hard
to say the word "abuse"

1460
01:16:57,117 --> 01:17:01,454
because I did not consider
that to be abuse at the time.

1461
01:17:02,322 --> 01:17:05,525
I think my older brother
initiated it with me.

1462
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:10,697
I remember in the early stages

1463
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:14,000
being uncomfortable with that.

1464
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,869
But later when I found out

1465
01:17:15,935 --> 01:17:19,539
that he was also...

1466
01:17:19,606 --> 01:17:21,941
being sexual with my sister,

1467
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:27,914
I became curious and
probably got involved that way.

1468
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:33,753
So the incidents with your
brother at a younger age,

1469
01:17:33,787 --> 01:17:36,523
the incidents with your brother
at an older age when you were 15?

1470
01:17:36,623 --> 01:17:37,524
Yes.

1471
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:39,392
Multiple incidents with your sister

1472
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:40,894
when she was approximately nine.

1473
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,895
Correct.

1474
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,564
Then you had at least
the two incidents

1475
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:46,399
with the visiting priests

1476
01:17:46,433 --> 01:17:48,201
when you were 10 or 11.

1477
01:17:48,301 --> 01:17:49,469
Yes.

1478
01:17:52,972 --> 01:17:55,041
Have you ever thought, Oliver,

1479
01:17:55,108 --> 01:17:58,578
that some of your problems
that you encountered as a priest

1480
01:17:58,645 --> 01:18:00,714
that led to your incarceration

1481
01:18:00,814 --> 01:18:02,282
may be related to that?

1482
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:06,886
I have thought about it,

1483
01:18:06,953 --> 01:18:09,289
but I can't seem
to make a link.

1484
01:18:13,326 --> 01:18:16,563
I'm never going to get
what I want out of this.

1485
01:18:16,663 --> 01:18:17,664
Not from Mahony.

1486
01:18:17,731 --> 01:18:21,434
I'm never going to
see them all in jail.

1487
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:23,103
So who gives a shit
what they think?

1488
01:18:23,169 --> 01:18:26,406
You just do what you want
to do to take care of yourself.

1489
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:29,275
To hell with them.

1490
01:18:29,342 --> 01:18:31,277
That's what you got to do.

1491
01:18:31,344 --> 01:18:34,114
We're trying to
uncover the truth.

1492
01:18:34,147 --> 01:18:35,615
We're here to support you

1493
01:18:35,682 --> 01:18:38,618
and we're here to support
all of the other kids,

1494
01:18:38,718 --> 01:18:43,123
because this is big
business to the Church.

1495
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:45,792
This is money to the Church.

1496
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:48,161
It's like a big corporation.

1497
01:18:48,194 --> 01:18:49,763
We have to ask ourselves

1498
01:18:49,829 --> 01:18:54,968
who's paying for this
nightmare, for this crisis?

1499
01:18:55,035 --> 01:18:56,469
Who is obliged to get involved?

1500
01:18:56,536 --> 01:18:57,604
I think we all are.

1501
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:59,672
One of the things
that I've seen

1502
01:18:59,706 --> 01:19:03,109
in my time with
people like yourselves

1503
01:19:03,209 --> 01:19:05,979
has been a change in the
understanding of what church is.

1504
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:07,681
Many of us, when I ask you,

1505
01:19:07,681 --> 01:19:09,149
"When you hear
the word 'church,'

1506
01:19:09,215 --> 01:19:10,483
what comes to your mind?"

1507
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:14,120
Most of us will think
of bishops, the Vatican,

1508
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:17,490
the hierarchy,
church buildings.

1509
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:19,359
That will be changing,
it is changing,

1510
01:19:19,392 --> 01:19:20,660
because church is us.

1511
01:19:20,727 --> 01:19:22,762
It's right here in this room.

1512
01:19:22,862 --> 01:19:24,330
25 years ago,

1513
01:19:24,397 --> 01:19:28,835
Tom Doyle called
the bishops to action

1514
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:32,505
and put a plan before the U.S.
Catholic Conference of Bishops,

1515
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:34,874
a comprehensive plan
to address the crisis

1516
01:19:34,908 --> 01:19:36,509
of pedophilia in the priesthood.

1517
01:19:36,576 --> 01:19:38,011
Basically, they wrote a report

1518
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:41,314
and said this is going
to be a massive crisis

1519
01:19:41,414 --> 01:19:44,851
that's going to cost the Church a
billion dollars unless you do something.

1520
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:49,856
They found that there
was a national crisis

1521
01:19:49,923 --> 01:19:53,526
of children being sexually
abused by priests

1522
01:19:53,593 --> 01:19:56,029
on a massive scale.

1523
01:19:56,096 --> 01:19:57,364
I didn't know what
they were doing.

1524
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,199
I thought that they would
take it and do something

1525
01:19:59,265 --> 01:20:00,367
because they were...

1526
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:02,235
the Catholic Bishops
Conference in the United States

1527
01:20:02,268 --> 01:20:04,704
were forever giving
pronouncements on everything

1528
01:20:04,771 --> 01:20:09,843
from nuclear war to the Boy Scouts
to animal husbandry to chewing gum.

1529
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:11,711
You name it, they were
giving pronouncements

1530
01:20:11,745 --> 01:20:13,346
on the morality of
just about everything.

1531
01:20:13,446 --> 01:20:15,582
But on this, they stonewalled.

1532
01:20:15,648 --> 01:20:18,551
Cardinal Ratzinger,
now Pope Benedict,

1533
01:20:18,618 --> 01:20:22,222
was head of what's called
the Office of the Congregation

1534
01:20:22,288 --> 01:20:24,891
for the Doctrine of the Faith.

1535
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:29,195
The head of my church,
the successor to Peter,

1536
01:20:29,295 --> 01:20:31,564
the Holy Father,

1537
01:20:31,598 --> 01:20:34,401
was the person in
charge of making sure

1538
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:36,569
that priests didn't
hurt children.

1539
01:20:36,669 --> 01:20:41,441
He was in charge of that
office from 1978 until 2005.

1540
01:20:41,441 --> 01:20:43,576
He did a very poor job,

1541
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:46,913
and basically was the one
person besides the Pope

1542
01:20:46,946 --> 01:20:50,250
who could have stopped it,
and he didn't.

1543
01:20:50,316 --> 01:20:54,788
What the bishops did is
they squelched the report...

1544
01:20:57,323 --> 01:20:58,758
they went back
to their dioceses,

1545
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:01,928
and they carried on as normal.

1546
01:21:01,961 --> 01:21:04,230
They knew children
were being victimized,

1547
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,933
and they did
absolutely nothing

1548
01:21:07,033 --> 01:21:09,936
except insure that law
enforcement and the public

1549
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:12,472
and the faithful
would not find out.

1550
01:21:12,505 --> 01:21:15,909
The bishops have known that
bishops, priests, and deacons

1551
01:21:16,009 --> 01:21:19,913
have been sexually abusing
children since the fourth century,

1552
01:21:20,013 --> 01:21:23,450
and it's been a severe
major, major problem,

1553
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,618
and they've never really
been able to curb it.

1554
01:21:25,685 --> 01:21:28,955
Basically, you have a
sexualized priesthood.

1555
01:21:29,022 --> 01:21:30,623
It's been sexualized for years,

1556
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:32,959
that looks at child sexual abuse

1557
01:21:32,992 --> 01:21:36,296
no different than it does if
you're having sex with a woman

1558
01:21:36,363 --> 01:21:41,134
because it's all a violation
of clerical celibacy.

1559
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:45,472
If all sex by
definition was bad sex

1560
01:21:45,505 --> 01:21:47,440
because you weren't
supposed to be having it,

1561
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:51,277
then pedophilia is just
another kind of bad sex.

1562
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:55,648
There is no basis in the scriptures
for mandatory celibacy.

1563
01:21:55,715 --> 01:21:57,984
It's not mandated by Christ.

1564
01:21:58,051 --> 01:22:00,987
It's not justified
anywhere in the gospels

1565
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:04,491
or in the life and times
and sayings of Christ.

1566
01:22:04,557 --> 01:22:06,626
All 12 apostles were married,

1567
01:22:06,726 --> 01:22:09,662
with probably the exception of John.

1568
01:22:09,729 --> 01:22:12,632
The first several dozen popes

1569
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:16,069
were married and had children.

1570
01:22:16,169 --> 01:22:19,506
It's something that the
institutional Church leaders

1571
01:22:19,572 --> 01:22:22,175
began to think about
and tried to impose

1572
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:25,011
at least from the
fourth century.

1573
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:27,180
Married priests,
when they died,

1574
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:30,717
their inheritance
went to their oldest son.

1575
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:33,319
So the institutionalized
Church leaders,

1576
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,023
desiring to stop this practice,
began to mandate celibacy

1577
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:41,361
so that when a priest's property
had to pass after he died

1578
01:22:41,428 --> 01:22:43,863
it would go to the
bishop or to the Church.

1579
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:46,132
What we have to remember
is a lot of the priests

1580
01:22:46,232 --> 01:22:47,867
who have been reported
as offenders

1581
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:51,204
went into the seminary
at a minor seminary

1582
01:22:51,237 --> 01:22:53,840
at ages 14, 15, 16.

1583
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,510
They may have been thinking
about a vocation even earlier.

1584
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,846
They got stopped.

1585
01:22:59,879 --> 01:23:03,216
They got literally arrested in
their psychosexual development.

1586
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:07,053
They're nurtured in an
attitude of negativity

1587
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,056
toward relationships,
toward women,

1588
01:23:10,123 --> 01:23:12,359
toward marriage,
and toward sexuality,

1589
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:14,561
and they never really
fully understand

1590
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:16,129
what any of these
are all about.

1591
01:23:16,196 --> 01:23:21,735
So when these men
became unable to be celibate

1592
01:23:21,801 --> 01:23:25,038
or when their sexual
urges overpowered them,

1593
01:23:25,138 --> 01:23:29,209
they sought out victims who
they experienced at some level

1594
01:23:29,309 --> 01:23:31,444
as psychosexual peers.

1595
01:23:34,647 --> 01:23:36,249
The L.A. Times recently reported

1596
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:41,254
that 10% of the seminary
graduates from St. John's Seminary,

1597
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:43,723
where the vast majority
of priests in the western U.S.

1598
01:23:43,823 --> 01:23:45,091
went to the seminary,

1599
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:49,629
a full 10%, since 1960, of
their graduates are pedophiles.

1600
01:23:49,662 --> 01:23:51,264
Perpetrators of children.

1601
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:52,565
10%.

1602
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:54,934
If Yale was producing
10% of its students

1603
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:57,103
that became to
be perpetrators,

1604
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,271
somebody would take action.

1605
01:23:58,304 --> 01:24:01,775
In Boston, after the final
settlements were made

1606
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:06,613
for about $85 million
a couple of years ago,

1607
01:24:06,713 --> 01:24:09,249
one of the priests said
publicly at an interview,

1608
01:24:09,315 --> 01:24:11,751
"Thank God this
clergy crisis is over.

1609
01:24:11,851 --> 01:24:13,920
Now we can get
back to normal."

1610
01:24:13,953 --> 01:24:15,989
The situation was far worse

1611
01:24:16,022 --> 01:24:21,294
than even what the most hardened
cynic thought was going on.

1612
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:25,031
Cardinal Law, who was
the archbishop of Boston,

1613
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:28,368
presided over some of
the worst sexual abusers

1614
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:30,870
in the history of the Church.

1615
01:24:30,904 --> 01:24:36,609
It was something that ultimately
caused Cardinal Law to step down.

1616
01:24:36,676 --> 01:24:38,578
You would think,
if you presided

1617
01:24:38,645 --> 01:24:41,848
over the abuse of
dozens of children,

1618
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:45,018
that that would mean you
would be sent to a punishment.

1619
01:24:45,118 --> 01:24:47,420
You know, the Vatican
didn't even make it a secret.

1620
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,589
They thought he was
unfairly accused in the media.

1621
01:24:49,656 --> 01:24:51,925
They made him the
cardinal archbishop

1622
01:24:52,025 --> 01:24:53,993
of this church in Rome,

1623
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:58,131
and he actually presided at
Pope John Paul II's funeral Mass.

1624
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:00,000
What's happening in Los Angeles

1625
01:25:00,033 --> 01:25:03,536
does in many ways dwarf
what happened in Boston.

1626
01:25:03,603 --> 01:25:05,972
As of June 2002,

1627
01:25:06,072 --> 01:25:10,276
we had over 100 criminal
investigations ongoing,

1628
01:25:10,377 --> 01:25:15,348
and that encompassed
over 100 individual priests.

1629
01:25:15,415 --> 01:25:20,653
What that tells you is how large
the scope of this problem is.

1630
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:24,357
I think the Vatican
is looking for a way

1631
01:25:24,457 --> 01:25:26,893
to say "We've solved this",

1632
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,496
and they are scapegoating...

1633
01:25:29,596 --> 01:25:32,799
because so many of the
victims were male victims,

1634
01:25:32,866 --> 01:25:35,035
they're scapegoating
the homosexual priests

1635
01:25:35,101 --> 01:25:37,437
and saying "If we get rid
of the homosexual priests,

1636
01:25:37,504 --> 01:25:38,872
then we'll be rid
of this problem".

1637
01:25:38,938 --> 01:25:43,710
Most men who abuse
children are heterosexual.

1638
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:45,578
The Bishops' Conference, I think,

1639
01:25:45,645 --> 01:25:48,381
would like to project that
this problem is now over with.

1640
01:25:48,481 --> 01:25:50,650
It's taken care of.
They have solved it,

1641
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,185
and it's now under control,

1642
01:25:52,252 --> 01:25:56,523
which is a normal
corporate approach

1643
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:59,359
to something of this nature.

1644
01:25:59,392 --> 01:26:01,761
I'm sure that the guys in
Enron thought that, too,

1645
01:26:01,795 --> 01:26:03,363
when they were discovered.

1646
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,198
Every day, every week,

1647
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:09,903
I learn of another
child, young adult,

1648
01:26:11,271 --> 01:26:12,672
offended by a cleric

1649
01:26:12,706 --> 01:26:15,675
who hasn't been disclosed
before this day,

1650
01:26:15,742 --> 01:26:19,679
and my fear is, my belief is,
that there are not hundreds,

1651
01:26:19,713 --> 01:26:22,148
but there are
thousands of offenders

1652
01:26:22,248 --> 01:26:25,118
yet to be exposed
and disclosed

1653
01:26:25,151 --> 01:26:29,422
still roaming the churches
in the landscapes in this U.S.,

1654
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:31,191
and tens of thousands...

1655
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:33,159
tens of thousands worldwide.

1656
01:26:33,193 --> 01:26:34,861
What is a good Catholic?

1657
01:26:34,928 --> 01:26:37,097
A good Catholic traditionally

1658
01:26:37,163 --> 01:26:39,065
is someone who kept
their mouth shut,

1659
01:26:39,132 --> 01:26:41,001
their pocketbook open,
you know...

1660
01:26:42,235 --> 01:26:43,503
Paid, prayed, and obeyed,

1661
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:46,306
was docile, went to Mass,
obeyed all the Commandments,

1662
01:26:46,406 --> 01:26:48,008
went to confession
on a regular basis.

1663
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:52,012
For the most part, was
ritualized, obedient, and quiet.

1664
01:26:52,078 --> 01:26:54,147
But a good Catholic
is not that at all.

1665
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:57,317
A good Catholic is a Catholic
in the model of Jesus Christ:

1666
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:59,352
a revolutionary,

1667
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:00,720
someone who's not afraid...

1668
01:27:04,858 --> 01:27:08,328
Someone who's not afraid
to get up and speak the truth.

1669
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:12,332
Remember, the only time
Christ ever got angry

1670
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:14,100
was when He went to church.

1671
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:17,837
And as we speak,
Tom Doyle goes to Rome,

1672
01:27:17,937 --> 01:27:19,739
not because the Pope's
gonna hear him,

1673
01:27:19,839 --> 01:27:22,809
but because he has to do
what they should be doing,

1674
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:24,744
and making those
known offenders,

1675
01:27:24,844 --> 01:27:28,548
such as Oliver O'Grady,
who now resides in Ireland,

1676
01:27:28,648 --> 01:27:32,385
known to the community
as an offender.

1677
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:36,089
I think a lot of the people
in Rome are in deep denial

1678
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:38,458
about just how
serious this issue is.

1679
01:27:38,525 --> 01:27:41,294
Never attempted this
before, honestly.

1680
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:43,563
<i>Pronto.</i>

1681
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:46,166
<i>Mi chiamo* Patrizio Wall.</i>

1682
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:49,602
I'm calling Father Tom Doyle,

1683
01:27:49,636 --> 01:27:51,638
who is in America.

1684
01:27:51,738 --> 01:27:54,641
Yes, you know Father Thomas?

1685
01:27:54,674 --> 01:27:58,111
Yeah. He will be
coming to Rome.

1686
01:27:58,178 --> 01:28:02,449
As far as I know, he's in Rome,
trying to help two victims,

1687
01:28:02,515 --> 01:28:04,484
one of whom's our
client, Ann Jyono.

1688
01:28:06,419 --> 01:28:08,355
They have an appointment
with somebody at the Holy See

1689
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:10,824
to hear their complaint.

1690
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:17,764
I'm doing this for my daughter,

1691
01:28:17,831 --> 01:28:19,265
but I said to her,

1692
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:24,104
"if you do it for the other
victims and the children...

1693
01:28:24,204 --> 01:28:27,073
"or...

1694
01:28:27,073 --> 01:28:28,675
the kids..."

1695
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:33,346
"I'll help."

1696
01:28:33,446 --> 01:28:35,315
By golly.

1697
01:28:36,683 --> 01:28:39,552
People got to know!

1698
01:28:39,586 --> 01:28:41,287
It's not right.

1699
01:28:41,321 --> 01:28:42,956
They haven't a clue, you know,

1700
01:28:43,056 --> 01:28:45,458
if it hasn't happened to them.

1701
01:28:45,525 --> 01:28:46,793
Nobody has a clue.

1702
01:28:46,893 --> 01:28:49,362
They have no idea
what it does to people.

1703
01:28:49,396 --> 01:28:50,897
And we're not victims...

1704
01:28:50,964 --> 01:28:52,198
Destroys you everywhere.

1705
01:28:52,265 --> 01:28:54,367
...in that sense,
but Ann was a victim.

1706
01:28:54,434 --> 01:28:57,804
She was raped by this priest!

1707
01:28:57,837 --> 01:29:02,042
People understand, he's isn't
a pedophile, he's a rapist!

1708
01:29:03,209 --> 01:29:06,112
My anger's so hard.

1709
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:37,377
Right now, I'm in Rome,

1710
01:29:37,444 --> 01:29:39,412
and I'm waiting to meet
with the Jyonos,

1711
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:40,680
a family whose children

1712
01:29:40,747 --> 01:29:43,850
have been sexually
abused by Oliver O'Grady.

1713
01:29:43,917 --> 01:29:47,153
I've not met them.
I'm going to meet them,

1714
01:29:47,253 --> 01:29:50,523
and my purpose is to
hopefully help them

1715
01:29:50,623 --> 01:29:53,460
begin a healing process.

1716
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:54,527
Good morning.
How are you, dear?

1717
01:29:54,561 --> 01:29:57,530
Good morning.
I'm glad to see you.

1718
01:29:58,131 --> 01:30:00,033
How do you feel?

1719
01:30:07,107 --> 01:30:08,441
This is Ann.

1720
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,451
And what I'm gonna do is,

1721
01:30:18,518 --> 01:30:21,187
if we preface this one
with a short sentence

1722
01:30:21,287 --> 01:30:23,289
and say...

1723
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:26,459
"Bishops, archbishops, and cardinals

1724
01:30:26,526 --> 01:30:29,129
have consistently lied
to us and to the public

1725
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:31,297
and to law
enforcement agencies

1726
01:30:31,364 --> 01:30:33,333
about the cover-up

1727
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,236
of sexual abuse by
the clergy, period."

1728
01:30:36,336 --> 01:30:39,205
We'll address it to the Pope,

1729
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:41,641
and it'll be from you specifically,

1730
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:44,411
but speaking in the
name of all those

1731
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:46,446
who have been
victimized and molested,

1732
01:30:46,513 --> 01:30:49,082
and I'm gonna put it in
language that they will...

1733
01:30:49,182 --> 01:30:50,650
direct language they'll understand.

1734
01:32:48,501 --> 01:32:51,438
A lot has changed in the
Catholic Church this year,

1735
01:32:51,538 --> 01:32:53,006
but it's still having trouble

1736
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:56,109
responding to the victims
of sexual abuse by priests.

1737
01:32:56,209 --> 01:32:59,412
Today, two American
women came to the Vatican

1738
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:02,882
hoping to deliver a
letter to the new Pope.

1739
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:05,452
The guards wouldn't let them in.

1740
01:33:05,518 --> 01:33:09,956
Since we are survivors
of clergy abuse,

1741
01:33:10,023 --> 01:33:12,425
it has been a very
difficult journey,

1742
01:33:12,525 --> 01:33:15,061
and we have come
thousands of miles

1743
01:33:15,128 --> 01:33:20,734
to try to plead for some sort
of mercy and assistance

1744
01:33:20,834 --> 01:33:24,070
with our journey
of pain and healing.

1745
01:33:24,170 --> 01:33:27,474
We seek to regain our faith.

1746
01:33:38,518 --> 01:33:40,387
And instead of...

1747
01:33:40,487 --> 01:33:42,789
embracing them,
reaching out to them,

1748
01:33:42,889 --> 01:33:45,458
the institutional church
not only rejected them,

1749
01:33:45,525 --> 01:33:47,293
but they revictimized them.

1750
01:33:47,394 --> 01:33:49,796
They abused them by
pointing them out to be...

1751
01:33:49,863 --> 01:33:52,198
making them out to be
an enemy of the Church.

1752
01:33:52,265 --> 01:33:57,537
I got them alone at one point
and expressed a sincere apology,

1753
01:33:57,604 --> 01:33:59,906
my profound regrets as to
what had happened to them,

1754
01:34:00,006 --> 01:34:01,141
and I apologized to them

1755
01:34:01,207 --> 01:34:02,575
in the name of the institution,

1756
01:34:02,642 --> 01:34:03,877
the clergy, and the priests,

1757
01:34:03,943 --> 01:34:06,246
which I am still legally a part of.

1758
01:34:06,312 --> 01:34:08,281
And both of them said,

1759
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:11,317
"No one has ever said
this to us before."

1760
01:34:50,924 --> 01:34:52,192
I made up my mind.

1761
01:34:52,225 --> 01:34:53,793
There is no God.

1762
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:57,564
I do not believe
in a God, all right?

1763
01:34:57,630 --> 01:35:01,768
All of these rules, everything...

1764
01:35:01,801 --> 01:35:05,238
they're made up
by man, you know?

1765
01:35:05,305 --> 01:35:09,009
I've tried to find...

1766
01:35:09,075 --> 01:35:12,445
what it is that...

1767
01:35:12,512 --> 01:35:14,748
brought religion
to where it is today,

1768
01:35:14,814 --> 01:35:17,017
why, you know,

1769
01:35:17,083 --> 01:35:20,053
what differences in them...

1770
01:35:21,521 --> 01:35:23,923
the similarities in all of them,

1771
01:35:23,957 --> 01:35:26,326
and I think that that's
a big thing for me

1772
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:29,462
is that they all...

1773
01:35:29,529 --> 01:35:34,401
share some common theme
or philosophy at some level,

1774
01:35:34,467 --> 01:35:39,739
and you can't say
"This one, not that one"

1775
01:35:39,806 --> 01:35:42,809
without alienating someone, so...

1776
01:35:42,842 --> 01:35:45,645
And that's not...
That wasn't the message

1777
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,482
of Jesus or Buddha or
Mohammad or anybody,

1778
01:35:49,516 --> 01:35:52,385
so what's...

1779
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:55,088
They're already
off-base at that point,

1780
01:35:55,155 --> 01:35:57,057
and that happened
a long time ago,

1781
01:35:57,123 --> 01:36:02,629
so... I think it's just all...

1782
01:36:02,729 --> 01:36:04,397
all where...

1783
01:36:04,497 --> 01:36:08,234
the only place it could have
gone is the wrong direction.

1784
01:36:08,335 --> 01:36:10,203
What we need to do as a Church

1785
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:13,406
is to acknowledge our
good days and our bad days,

1786
01:36:13,473 --> 01:36:15,542
our good times
and our bad times.

1787
01:36:15,608 --> 01:36:17,811
Somehow we always
seem to look back

1788
01:36:17,877 --> 01:36:21,715
and say, "Well, there were
dark moments and times

1789
01:36:21,815 --> 01:36:23,083
"in our history.

1790
01:36:23,116 --> 01:36:25,218
We would rather
not dwell on them."

1791
01:36:25,318 --> 01:36:27,420
In a very poetic way, you see?

1792
01:36:27,487 --> 01:36:29,089
And that's very nice.

1793
01:36:29,155 --> 01:36:30,957
But it's not reality.

1794
01:36:31,057 --> 01:36:32,926
What I'd like to hear,
to say, "Hey,

1795
01:36:32,993 --> 01:36:35,395
"you know, we had one
heck of an awful time

1796
01:36:35,462 --> 01:36:36,896
there in the Middle Ages.

1797
01:36:36,963 --> 01:36:40,900
But you know what?
We're still here."

1798
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:43,169
And that's the point,

1799
01:36:43,236 --> 01:36:45,071
if the Church could see it.

1800
01:38:19,299 --> 01:38:23,069
And I'm here speaking
on behalf of Brandon...

1801
01:38:24,571 --> 01:38:28,274
with his parents today

1802
01:38:28,375 --> 01:38:32,278
because this offender...

1803
01:38:32,379 --> 01:38:34,447
is still in ministry.
