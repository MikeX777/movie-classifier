Man, that was some blast last night.

28
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:34,099
Robert's old lady was about to pass
when we smashed that mirror.

29
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,603
I don't know why those fossils
blow their mind

30
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:39,605
over some stupid furniture.

31
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:42,775
- They can buy some more, right?
- Right.

32
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,278
Hey, Bitsy, when's the next party?

33
00:07:46,612 --> 00:07:48,212
The group's ready for...

34
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:49,712
action.

35
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:53,160
It's always ready for action.

36
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:55,996
Let's get some action right now, huh?

37
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,290
You know how, Dexter, don't you?

38
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,417
Hey, Dexter, me too?

39
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:03,988
Uh, no, Lum, it's, uh...

40
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,573
You're not making this scene.

41
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:08,367
You'll be the hero
at the next smash-up, eh, right?

42
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,635
Right.

43
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:18,185
He's a good guy, but a real drag.

44
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,771
Lummox is okay.

45
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:23,482
You see him smash up
that piano at Turner's place?

46
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,818
He really digs breaking up stuff.

47
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,195
I think he's cute.

48
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:31,073
You think anything in pants is cute.

49
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:35,578
Let's get out of here
and into some real action, huh?

50
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:37,771
You're uptight, Dexter, baby?

51
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,498
Let's go make a lovin', huh?

52
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,317
Private or...

53
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,919
No, just with me and thee.

54
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:46,672
And the bottle of speed.

55
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:10,613
Where'd they go, Cransy?

56
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,159
They went fishing, Lum.

57
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:18,912
Oh, fishing!

58
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:20,831
Yeah, fishing's fun.

59
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:25,544
Wow, look at that.

60
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,088
Ain't they hot?

61
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,057
You got a problem, bunkie?

62
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:41,560
Let's get married.

63
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,355
Are you nuts or something? Go away.

64
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,152
I said, you're my girl!

65
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:52,738
I said, "Go away!"

66
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:56,283
You don't act nice!

67
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,869
- I said, you're my...
- Leave me alone!

68
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:05,751
You just don't make the scene, man.

69
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,003
"Make it?" He isn't even in it.

70
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:11,256
Let's get out of here
before we'll have to bust the joint up.

71
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:17,137
He's terrible.

72
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:25,262
Nobody even noticed my new Supergirl uplift.

73
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:43,909
Cool it, man.

74
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,327
I know him.

75
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,080
I'll kill that dirty mother...

76
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,706
Look, man.

77
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:51,416
He's not a bad guy.

78
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,252
He's just a little square.

79
00:12:54,086 --> 00:12:57,089
Remember that trouble I got in
with Max gang a while back?

80
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,633
They would've busted my head in

81
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:02,594
if he hadn't jumped in there and helped me.

82
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,390
Yeah.

83
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:08,725
I owe him one.

84
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:10,377
I don't give a...

85
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:12,646
Nobody makes Denny Fortune
look like an idiot.

86
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:14,064
I'm getting him.

87
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:16,592
Yeah, knock off the beef, huh?

88
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,777
Let's go get into some action, come on.

89
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,487
- Yeah, good idea.
- Come on.

Can't complain.

- Don't tell me you're...
- No, not yet.

What do you want, Dexter?

144
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,335
Look, man.

145
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,713
Got a little friction here.

146
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:40,218
He's got it in his mind that you
laid an insult on him.

147
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,388
He wants to fight you.

148
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,435
Now, I told him about
our scuffle a while back.

149
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:51,313
And I owe you one.

150
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,025
So, I just wanted to warn you.

151
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:01,406
He's mean.

152
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:05,101
He the one that was playing tough guy

153
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,912
in front of the... club the other day?

154
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,415
Yeah, man, he's young.

155
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:13,168
He's just goofing off, you know.

156
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:20,425
You always do all his talking for him,
or is he a ventriloquist?

157
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:30,602
Man...

158
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:32,771
Don't wise off to me.

159
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:36,608
I'm trying to keep you from getting
your head busted in.

160
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:40,512
Well, thanks for the warning,

161
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,697
but I'm not gonna worry about it.

162
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:56,461
This is for the drink your friend ruined.

163
00:21:58,296 --> 00:21:59,422
Easy, junior.

164
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:02,534
Let's get this straight.

165
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:03,968
You got a beef with me?

166
00:22:04,803 --> 00:22:06,638
Let's get it on right now.

167
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:10,475
Hey, stop that.

168
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,812
Get out of here. Stop that!
Do what I tell you!

169
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:16,731
Stop it!

170
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,992

- Get him, get him. Come on.

Get him, Denny!

173
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:56,521
Come on, Denny, hit him!

174
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:18,042
Come on, Denny.

175
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:34,350
Yeah, come on!

176
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:39,272
- Come on, Denny, get up.
- Get up!

177
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:48,948
Come on, get up!

178
00:23:49,324 --> 00:23:50,325
Get up!

179
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,081
Come on, come on.

180
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,801

181
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:26,361

184
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,810
Hey! You wrecked my place!

185
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:00,019
Yeah.

186
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:30,234
He's calling the police!

187
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,571
He's calling the police!

188
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:41,639
The guy never had a chance.

189
00:27:41,973 --> 00:27:44,434
He let them fight,
didn't even call the police.

190
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:46,252
They wrecked his joint

191
00:27:46,352 --> 00:27:49,272
and burned his hand so bad
it looked like burnt hamburger.

192
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:53,526
We have an idea who's involved in this, sir.

193
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:55,762
Dexter Jaffian.

194
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,447
Yeah, bring him in, Sanders.

195
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,307
He's as good as any I know.

196
00:27:59,407 --> 00:28:02,326
These groups wandering around today,
looking for trouble...

197
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,455
Dropping out of school,
letting their hair grow,

198
00:28:05,663 --> 00:28:09,542
joining some damn-fool movement,
getting in trouble somewhere along the line.

199
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:12,503
We get them in here
for assault and battery all the time.

200
00:28:13,337 --> 00:28:15,061
They get into trouble
all along the line

201
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:16,949
so you might as well go out
and pick them up.

202
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,051
They're restless,
they're looking for trouble.

203
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:20,845
They're like a plague of rats.

204
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,263
I'm disgusted.

205
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:29,020
Hey, slob, I'm talking to you. Answer me.

206
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:31,105
Where were you yesterday afternoon?

207
00:28:46,245 --> 00:28:47,288
Sorry, man.

208
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:50,500
Hmm, geez, I'm bushed.

209
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:55,713
Then, now...

210
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,218
Where was I yesterday afternoon?

211
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,554
Hmm, where was I?

212
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:07,350
I must've been somewhere.

213
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:12,814
I mean, everybody's got to be somewhere.

214
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:17,151
Cut the comedy, answer the question.

215
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:20,613
Forgive me, fuzzy wuzzy...

216
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:24,951
But didn't hear the question.

217
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:29,872
Okay, Dexter, let's take it from the top.

218
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,500
Look, kid, we got all day.

219
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:35,670
All week if necessary.

220
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,380
No difference to me.

221
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:39,507
Now, where were you yesterday?

222
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,060
What was that? Speak up.

223
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,776
What are you saying? Talk louder.

224
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:03,281
I said...

225
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:06,784
"You've got bad breath, fuzz!

226
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:08,619
"Bad breath!"

227
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:12,999
No touching.

228
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,299
Now let's talk straight.

229
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:32,143
I told you a hundred times
where I was yesterday.

230
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,897
I was at my girl's, sacking up.

231
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:39,650
Call her, ask her,

232
00:30:40,651 --> 00:30:42,028
and quit bugging me.

233
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:46,157
You can't hold me here and you know it.

234
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:48,701
So, knock it off,

235
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:52,246
and go play cops and robbers
with someone else.

236
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,252
And when you call my girl,

237
00:30:59,545 --> 00:31:00,588
be polite,

238
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,215
and don't breathe on her.

239
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:27,550
♪ They're as slimy as a rattle snake

240
00:32:27,758 --> 00:32:30,845

No, no, no.

Stop it! Stop it! Come on!

253
00:37:48,245 --> 00:37:49,413
Let me go!

254
00:37:51,457 --> 00:37:52,750
Leave me alone!

255
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:46,637
No, no, no!

256
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,214
They have the greatest sound system in it.

257
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:07,050
- Oh, they're so great.
- They're so great.

258
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:12,723
Gee, am I ever lucky meeting the four of you!

259
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:15,376
Come on, why are you lucky?

260
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:17,895
Well, besides being the four
prettiest girls in school...

261
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:21,173
...you can do me a real big favor.

262
00:40:21,273 --> 00:40:23,609
Why should we do you a favor?
We don't even know you.

263
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:28,071
A group of us guys are throwing a party
for Rocky Reese.

264
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:30,574
Oh! Rocky Reese!

265
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:32,117
Oh, my God.

266
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:35,370
One problem, we're short four girls.

267
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:39,316
How would you girls like to come?

268
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:41,693
What? It'll be so cool.

269
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,128
- All right.
- Great.

270
00:40:45,964 --> 00:40:48,425
Gee, I don't know,
mom's expecting me home, Nancy.

271
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,286
Come on Betsy, Rocky Reese!

272
00:40:51,386 --> 00:40:53,597
I won't miss meeting him for anything.

273
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:07,236
Oh plug it to me, baby.

274
00:41:20,582 --> 00:41:21,625
Hey!

275
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,793
What you doing?

276
00:42:19,224 --> 00:42:22,102
So you've come to see Rocky Reese, huh?

277
00:42:22,603 --> 00:42:25,188
But he'll be a little late,
so why don't you just

278
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:27,482
make yourselves at home?

279
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:30,027
Bitsy!

280
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:34,197
Get the gals something to drink.

281
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:45,769
Everybody! Hey! Hey!

282
00:43:45,894 --> 00:43:47,896
Everybody wait! Wait a minute now. Wait!

283
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:52,025
We have some newcomers today, you know?

284
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:56,822
Who wants to introduce them to our society?

285
00:43:56,947 --> 00:43:58,156
Yay!

286
00:44:43,535 --> 00:44:44,578
Hey!

287
00:44:44,786 --> 00:44:46,863
You've gone and had your fun.
Now it's our turn.

288
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:47,964
Yeah!

289
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,209
Oh, my God!

290
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:52,627
Oh, my God!

291
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,524
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

292
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:16,610
Here they come.

293
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,623
What? Sorry...

294
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,293
Rocky Reese can't make the party.

295
00:45:35,712 --> 00:45:37,280
Now you girls... Listen!

296
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,673
Listen to me!

297
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,383
Now you girls listen to me.

298
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:43,512
We're gonna take you for a little ride,

299
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:45,722
way out in the country.

300
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,141
When you get back,

301
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:50,435
you can tell your friends what you want,

302
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:53,313
but if you tell them about us,

303
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:55,524
the next party we have

304
00:45:56,274 --> 00:45:57,818
will be your last.

305
00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:01,071
Also, also...

306
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:03,056
We have some great pictures

307
00:46:03,156 --> 00:46:05,575
and we'd be glad to mail them to your folks.

308
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:08,537
Now get them out of here!

309
00:46:08,912 --> 00:46:09,955
Get out!

310
00:46:24,469 --> 00:46:25,554
Good, Danny.

311
00:46:28,098 --> 00:46:29,558
Come on, pitch the ball.

312
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:31,434
Come on, hit it, Danny.

313
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:35,397
Got one.

314
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:40,569
Cransy, can I play, huh?

315
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:42,946
Don't ask me, ask them.

316
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:53,957
Hey, can I play ball?

317
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,292
No, you can't.

318
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:57,460
I want to play.

319
00:46:57,919 --> 00:47:00,088
Well, go play with guys your own size.

320
00:47:03,091 --> 00:47:04,451
I want to play ball.

321
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:05,702
Let me play.

322
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:07,470
Come on, guys, let's get him.

323
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:21,151
Let go of me!

324
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:30,952
Let me go.

325
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:32,829
Let me go!

326
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:35,040
Let me go!

327
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,039
Let go of me!

328
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:31,304
What the hell you think you're doing?

329
00:48:32,055 --> 00:48:34,683
Aren't you men enough to pick
on someone your own size?

330
00:48:35,308 --> 00:48:36,559
Oh, man!

331
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:40,021
You just don't know when to keep
your nose out of it, do you?

332
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:42,399
Man here wants to take us on, I guess.

333
00:48:57,622 --> 00:48:58,707
Officer!

334
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:04,988
- Leave him alone.
- Back it up, I said. Back it up!

335
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:06,656
- Back it up.
- All right, all right.

336
00:49:06,756 --> 00:49:08,450
- Come on!
- Leave him alone!

337
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,826
All right, what's going on here?

338
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:12,554
I saw the whole thing, Officer,
it was terrible.

339
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:15,015
Bullying those little boys, terrible.

340
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,808
Okay, lady, who started all this?

341
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:18,435
Oh, yes, uh...

342
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:20,478
He started it.

343
00:49:20,729 --> 00:49:21,922
Can you tell it to the judge?

344
00:49:22,022 --> 00:49:23,064
All right, yes.

345
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:26,276
They were playing ball
and he started a fight.

346
00:49:26,651 --> 00:49:29,029
Or was it them?

347
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,948
No, no, it was he that started the fight.

348
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:33,950
That's not true, Officer.

349
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:36,786
They were bullying those poor little boys

350
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:39,330
and Doug only tried helping them.

351
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,958
And then they grab Doug.

352
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:46,713
That's a downright lie, young woman,
I know what I saw.

353
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,786
All right, let's go,
we're all going for a ride.

354
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:55,205
- But just a minute, Officer, just a minute.
- That's enough, miss.

355
00:49:55,305 --> 00:49:57,624
- Ma'am, we'd like you to come with us.
- Yes, indeed.

356
00:49:57,724 --> 00:49:59,934
- But Officer...
- What is this world coming to?

357
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:21,623
I can't believe this happened, Doug.

358
00:50:21,956 --> 00:50:26,169
How could they let those goons off
and blame the whole thing on you?

359
00:50:26,628 --> 00:50:29,631
They actually believe that senile old woman.

360
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,092
Just forget it, Jeanne.

361
00:50:32,342 --> 00:50:33,551
Maybe Cransy's right.

362
00:50:34,385 --> 00:50:36,096
I ought to keep my nose to myself.

363
00:50:36,346 --> 00:50:37,514
No, you shouldn't.

364
00:50:37,847 --> 00:50:38,890
No one should.

365
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,309
That's the whole trouble nowadays.

366
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:44,312
Everybody just turns his back
when anything happens.

367
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:46,773
Oh, this whole thing makes me sick.

368
00:50:47,232 --> 00:50:49,150
It cost you $300,

369
00:50:49,984 --> 00:50:51,611
and they get off with a warning.

370
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:54,322
What's the matter with the law, Doug?

371
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:57,992
Who knows?

372
00:50:58,868 --> 00:51:00,161
They do what they can.

373
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:01,913
Let's just drop it, huh?

374
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:11,714
Hello?

375
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:15,552
Hello?

376
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:24,227
Who... Who is this?

377
00:51:25,979 --> 00:51:27,021
Hello?

378
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:41,978
Who was that?

379
00:51:42,078 --> 00:51:43,163
I don't know.

380
00:51:43,496 --> 00:51:45,248
Just the man's voice saying

381
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:48,459
that you and I are in trouble
for squealing against the

382
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:49,711
group to the police.

383
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:51,921
Oh, Doug, I'm frightened.

384
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:21,610
I want to talk to you, Dexter.

385
00:54:24,907 --> 00:54:26,743
What's on your mind, man?

386
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:30,455
It's about a phone call Jeanne got.

387
00:54:32,123 --> 00:54:33,416
Know anything about it?

388
00:54:36,002 --> 00:54:37,253
Not me, man.

389
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:41,591
Someone trying to make time with your girl?

390
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:47,680
Cut it, Dexter.

391
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,225
Let's talk straight.

392
00:54:52,101 --> 00:54:53,644
Anything happens to Jeanne,

393
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:57,648
I'm holding you personally responsible.

394
00:54:57,774 --> 00:54:58,816
Get that?

395
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:01,652
Look, man,

396
00:55:02,153 --> 00:55:04,614
I paid you back what I owed you,

397
00:55:06,282 --> 00:55:07,867
now you're on your own.

398
00:55:09,285 --> 00:55:11,829
Don't threatened me, man.

399
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:14,165
I'm not threatening you,

400
00:55:14,665 --> 00:55:15,708
I'm telling you.

401
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,170
Personally responsible.

402
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:21,798
I'll kill you.

403
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:52,008
Hey, what do you want?

404
00:59:20,453 --> 00:59:21,621
Hold her leg.

405
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:38,638
Hold her leg.

Hello, police department?

421
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:29,613
Yes.
This is Jeanne Blake at 435 North Oakling.

422
01:05:31,281 --> 01:05:32,308
Yes.

423
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:34,284
I'd like to report a...

424
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:37,646
Well, you see,
I got a phone call the other night

425
01:05:37,746 --> 01:05:40,874
and this voice threatened
me and my boyfriend and...

426
01:05:43,002 --> 01:05:45,029
Well, no, I don't know who called.

427
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:46,797
But I tell you I'm frightened.

428
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:49,550
Doug was to be here two hours ago.

429
01:05:52,011 --> 01:05:54,163
What do you mean
there's nothing you can do?

430
01:05:54,263 --> 01:05:55,639
You're the police.

431
01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:01,770
No, I don't want to change my phone number.

432
01:06:01,937 --> 01:06:03,439
What good will that do?

433
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:09,528
Well, if you can't help me, who can?

434
01:06:12,448 --> 01:06:14,988
Well, why don't you drink
a hot glass of milk,

435
01:06:15,089 --> 01:06:16,493
and take a tranquilizer!

436
01:06:16,618 --> 01:06:18,620
I'm sorry I troubled you!

437
01:06:58,118 --> 01:07:00,370
Everybody will be here in an hour.

438
01:07:01,163 --> 01:07:02,706
You all know what to do?

439
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,209
Dexter,

440
01:07:06,001 --> 01:07:09,088
just as long as I get Doug,
that's what I want.

441
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,508
Listen, man.

442
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:15,306
When you wanna get to someone,

443
01:07:15,407 --> 01:07:18,410
you do it to the thing
they care about most.

444
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:22,392
Now, with Doug,
it's this chick Jeanne.

445
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:25,521
You rip her up bad enough,

446
01:07:26,355 --> 01:07:27,815
he'll get the picture.

447
01:07:28,899 --> 01:07:30,359
So then what does he do?

448
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,444
Who cares.

449
01:07:33,153 --> 01:07:34,822
If he still wants to play...

450
01:07:36,532 --> 01:07:37,616
...we play.

451
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:41,912
Bitsy.

452
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:46,041
Call Doug on the phone,
get him over to your apartment.

453
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:51,839
I want you to keep him there until I call.

454
01:07:53,048 --> 01:07:56,051
- Get it?
- Anything you say, babe.

455
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,221
As long as it's big, juicy and fights back.

456
01:08:06,061 --> 01:08:07,229
Hello, Doug?

457
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:08,897
This is Bitsy.

458
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,483
You know, Dexter's girl.

459
01:08:12,818 --> 01:08:14,678
Well, the man and me had a big fight

460
01:08:14,778 --> 01:08:17,781
over what they're planning to do
with that chick of yours.

461
01:08:18,574 --> 01:08:19,658
That's right.

462
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:25,080
See, maybe as a woman I don't cut
into other gals getting hurt.

463
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:33,797
How about 7:00?

464
01:08:35,174 --> 01:08:36,258
Fine.

465
01:08:39,011 --> 01:08:40,053
That's right, honey.

466
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:43,640
I live at 56 Acton Avenue.

467
01:08:45,851 --> 01:08:46,935
That's right.

468
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:48,937
See you then.

469
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:14,296
You're early, honey. Caught me in the bath.

470
01:09:15,005 --> 01:09:16,131
Come on in.

471
01:15:21,121 --> 01:15:22,330
Come on.

472
01:15:33,925 --> 01:15:36,177
Be quiet.

473
01:15:46,813 --> 01:15:48,106
Be quiet.

474
01:15:54,029 --> 01:15:55,905
String her up.

475
01:15:57,741 --> 01:15:58,908
String her up.

476
01:16:31,775 --> 01:16:34,903
On next Saturday is when they plan
to get Jeanne, Doug.

477
01:16:36,696 --> 01:16:37,989
That's all I know.

478
01:16:39,908 --> 01:16:41,076
Thanks, Bitsy.

479
01:16:41,785 --> 01:16:43,161
I better get going.

480
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,122
Doug,

481
01:16:46,581 --> 01:16:48,583
you have to go now, honey?

482
01:16:49,793 --> 01:16:52,212
Just when we were getting acquainted?

483
01:16:53,588 --> 01:16:54,673
Very nice.

484
01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:57,759
But I do have to go.

485
01:16:57,967 --> 01:16:59,469
You better put this back on.

486
01:17:00,095 --> 01:17:02,222
You might catch a cold or something.

487
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:08,520
Not if you keep me hot, honey.

488
01:17:11,147 --> 01:17:12,982
You don't want me to go, do you, hon?

489
01:17:13,817 --> 01:17:15,735
You want me to stay right here.

490
01:17:20,532 --> 01:17:21,783
You little tramp.

491
01:17:23,243 --> 01:17:26,621
This has all been a stinking trick
and I fell for it.

492
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:32,460
You get me over here alone
while those mothers try and get Jeanne.

493
01:17:34,921 --> 01:17:37,048
Put a coat on. We're getting out of here.

494
01:17:46,391 --> 01:17:48,268
If anything happens to Jeanne,

495
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:51,146
you'll never make it with another guy.

496
01:17:51,438 --> 01:17:52,814
I promise you that.

497
01:23:23,311 --> 01:23:24,771
They're done for.

498
01:23:26,355 --> 01:23:27,482
Why, son?

499
01:23:29,984 --> 01:23:31,402
Just for the hell of it.

500
01:23:32,153 --> 01:23:33,529
Just for keeps.

501
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:35,823
Come on.

502
01:24:21,369 --> 01:24:24,372
You know, those guys
gonna be in a lot of trouble.

503
01:24:25,915 --> 01:24:27,875
