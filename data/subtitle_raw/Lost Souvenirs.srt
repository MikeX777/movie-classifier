1
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,900
LOST SOUVENIRS

2
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,780
Good evening, Paris.
Recognize her?

3
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,620
What about the Place de l'Etoile
and the Arc de Triomphe?

4
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,460
The Place de la Concorde
and the Obelisk?

5
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,020
Rue Royale and Maxim's,
my little Madeleine?

6
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,780
The Montmartre hill
and its bell tower?

7
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,260
And what about this street?

8
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,980
It's in the 15th arrondisement,

9
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,220
Saint-Lambert neighborhood,
Convention metro station.

10
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,380
It also has its monument.

11
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,420
MORILLONS STREET

12
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,700
You only enter it with a lot
of anxiety and a little hope.

13
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,260
Let's do that, shall we?
Please, after you.

14
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,660
Shh, close the door.

15
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,300
This place has seen
many heartbeats yet.

16
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,300
Heavy hearts.

17
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,900
Light hearts.

18
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,980
Dry hearts.

19
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,140
Where are we? Guess. Turn around!

20
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,060
Are we in a junk shop?

21
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,700
At some collectors?

22
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,820
A pawn shop? Let's see!

23
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,460
Respect the tag!

24
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,980
Stop guessing.

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,700
We are in the temple
of absent-mindedness,

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,860
at the museum of distraction,

27
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,780
at the lost and found.

28
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,500
Look.

29
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,420
You can't believe your eyes!

30
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,780
This leg didn't just walk here!

31
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Is this your dresser, Henri II?

32
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,140
Your straw hat, Italy?

33
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,580
Your bugle, Deroulede?

34
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,980
Your boots, Bastien?

35
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,420
Are these your bells, Corneville?

36
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,340
General!

37
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,380
How did all these particular things
end up in here?

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,380
Following what drama,
comedy, or vaudeville?

39
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,620
Take this small statue
of Osiris for example,

40
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,620
with her unusual tutu
and her bow in her hair.

41
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,900
Well, this small statue of Osiris...

42
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,580
In the past, when evening came,

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,100
the night fell like a curtain
over the masterpieces of the Louvre.

44
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,140
And for the visitors,
it was the end of the show.

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,620
Today, everything has changed.

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,620
And you can see,
on this Christmas Eve,

47
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,940
the wonders of Egyptian art
in full sunlight,

48
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,020
and in fact, in the middle of Egypt,
as if you were there.

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
-It's beautiful, isn't it?
-It is.

50
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,020
What about these?

51
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,940
It's alive!

52
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,860
There is nothing like
living statues, living paintings.

53
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,140
Isn't Egypt beautiful?

54
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,220
It's nice, yes.

55
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,940
Very nice.

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,060
Especially at night.

57
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,860
For the wonders of the world,
especially on Christmas Eve,

58
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,260
there's no place like Paris.

59
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,420
I thought I already asked you
to space out your visits.

60
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,340
The world is full of mummies
less alive than these.

61
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,980
You have to thaw them out a bit,

62
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,900
to make them regain a taste for life.

63
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,740
Look, I warned you.
If you ever set foot in here again...

64
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,900
You must admit that for some time
now, I've made myself scarce.

65
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm an Egyptologist.

66
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,980
A day like today, I had to, right?

67
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,060
And here is Osiris!

68
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,860
The Egyptian legend tells that
he was killed and butchered

69
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,940
by seven gods of darkness,

70
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,140
and his remains were locked
in a chest and thrown into the sea.

71
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,780
The chest landed in Veneto
and was transformed into a column.

72
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,460
Isis discovered her husband's body
in the column, pulled him out

73
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,460
and gave him back his life
through her kisses and tears.

74
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,980
Osiris now rules over the dead.

75
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,460
Please follow me,
ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,820
Philippe!

77
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,580
Florence...

78
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,340
I'm glad to see you again, you know.

79
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm glad to see you, too.

80
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,580
It's not the same thing
since you left me.

81
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,780
After so many years,
are you still mad at me?

82
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,060
I don't hold grudges. You know that.

83
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,660
You've stayed the same.

84
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,140
As beautiful as ever.

85
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,980
-And yet...
-Yet what?

86
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,500
I don't know. You've changed.

87
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,140
-You're more...
-More elegant!

88
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,660
Expensive.
You have beautiful jewelry.

89
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,620
I'm glad, you know.

90
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,060
Without a doubt,

91
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,820
your luck has changed.

92
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,940
-What about you?
-Well...

93
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,860
Yes, yes, mine's changed, too.

94
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,020
In a good way.

95
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,100
That's probably why you left me
without news for years.

96
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,620
-Yet I haven't forgotten you.
-Of course.

97
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,940
No.

98
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,020
To be fair, you did send me
a statuette from Cairo.

99
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,140
-Osiris!
-Yes.

100
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,420
-You still have it?
-Yes.

101
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,660
In a drawer.

102
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,540
-It's a worthless object.
-Which made me happy.

103
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,940
At that time, in Cairo, I was
going through difficult times.

104
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,260
-Whereas now...
-Today, it's not the same.

105
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,260
I'm a real pharaoh over there.
I have a nice big house.

106
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,900
I mean, here,
they'd call it a palace.

107
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,100
-Are you working?
-Yes, for pleasure.

108
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,300
A big book on Egypt.

109
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,300
That's the reason why you had left.

110
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,300
Yes, and that's why I stayed there.

111
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,860
Yes, Paris wasn't built in a day,
but neither were the pyramids.

112
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,180
Still, Paris,

113
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,460
there's nothing like it
to take your mind off things.

114
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,660
Will you be staying long?

115
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,580
I'm afraid not.

116
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,580
I regret it after seeing you.

117
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,180
No, I'm leaving tomorrow morning
at dawn. By plane, of course.

118
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,140
I just came to enjoy myself,
to spend the holidays.

119
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,460
I stayed at a great hotel,
the Regina,

120
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,420
up the street from the Tuileries.

121
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,100
-I'm glad to hear it.
-Why?

122
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,660
Because we met

123
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,140
at the Tuileries.

124
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,620
Why do I have to remind me
of such nice memories?

125
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,140
You don't know what it's like for me

126
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,180
to see you there,
beautiful and happy.

127
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,060
Who told you I was happy?

128
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,540
You don't lack anything.

129
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,700
If this is happiness...

130
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,020
Sorry,

131
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,980
-I have to go.
-Why? Are you in a hurry?

132
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,340
Yes, it's Christmas, you understand.

133
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,380
-You're not free on New Year's Eve?
-No, but I can arrange it.

134
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,820
-Really?
-Yes!

135
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,580
Where shall we meet?

136
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,220
-What time?
-I don't know... midnight?

137
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,220
-Since it's Christmas.
-Yes, but where?

138
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,900
At your hotel? At the Regina?

139
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,500
Of course, at the Regina.

140
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,580
It's so much easier.
At the Regina then, at midnight.

141
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,260
We were looking for you, Florence!
Where were you?

142
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,540
In Egypt, in Cairo.

143
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,740
-Cairo?
-Yes,

144
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,900
in a castle in Spain.
There's a lot of them out there.

145
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,980
Thank you! Florence's turn.

146
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,020
Where is she?

147
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,940
There you are!

148
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,900
-Yes, I'm coming. Are you done?
-I am.

149
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,820
-So?
-Stand here.

150
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,340
Here? No!

151
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,900
How about here?

152
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,940
-I think it's better.
-Yes, maybe.

153
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,260
Very pretty. Don't move.

154
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,300
Yes, we will have a very nice shot,
and it will make some noise.

155
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,300
The most beautiful woman in Paris
in the world's most beautiful museum.

156
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,620
A smile wouldn't hurt.

157
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,620
-Think of something happy.
-That's easy.

158
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,620
-Aren't you happy?
-A little.

159
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,140
And being a little happy is a lot.

160
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,220
Come on,
Paris hasn't changed that much!

161
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,380
Still, we don't have
the fun we used to.

162
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,700
The little women in Paris,
it's over! It's over!

163
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,220
A small wave of modesty,

164
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,100
you need an advantage to bask
in the little women of Paris,

165
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,340
as beautiful, as desirable
and as undressed as ever,

166
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,100
but a little more discreet,
that's all.

167
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,060
What? What does he want?

168
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,380
To go get them!

169
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,460
That's it!
Gay Paris has no secrets for me.

170
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,300
Let's have a drink together.

171
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,300
-Get in!
-You're our guest.

172
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,300
-No, no...
-Yes, we're just passing through.

173
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,300
I have my own car.
There it is!

174
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,420
I'll send my driver away,
and I'll be right with you.

175
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,340
No need to wait for me.
I'm with friends.

176
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,420
Go home without me.

177
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,860
We're going to Neuilly.
Do you know it?

178
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,740
I'll sit by you.

179
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,900
He's nuts...

180
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,860
-Done?
-Yes.

181
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,580
Forgive me for robbing you.

182
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,180
-It's a shame.
-You can keep the coat for tonight.

183
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,700
-I didn't dare ask you.
-You were very wrong.

184
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,180
What if I asked you
to keep the dress, too?

185
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,780
Since it's done?

186
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,460
I couldn't refuse you.

187
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,220
Thank you.

188
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,700
Betty!

189
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,740
-Yes?
-Has the child been good?

190
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,460
Very good!

191
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,740
-So?
-She ate well, laughed,

192
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,620
asked for you a bit,
then fell asleep.

193
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,500
Merry Christmas, Gaston

194
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,100
Merry Christmas to all

195
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,580
Merry Christmas, Betty
Merry Christmas, Gaston

196
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,620
Merry Christmas to you, too,
And a good year...

197
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,140
-She's asleep.
-Got it.

198
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,020
Quiet! We're not here to disturb
the sleep of innocence.

199
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,140
Betty! Betty, listen!

200
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,060
Look, I'm a little embarrassed. I...

201
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,980
What? You've never been so cheerful!

202
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,740
Listen, I want to tell you...
I'd like to explain...

203
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,540
Sorry, I can't stay tonight.

204
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,220
-No way!
-I have to.

205
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,900
I'll explain later.
I had an unexpected encounter.

206
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,020
Something unexpected!

207
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,420
Everyone's bummed out,

208
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,940
especially Frederic,
who mostly came for you.

209
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,140
The party is ruined.
Everyone is sulking now.

210
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,900
I like Frederic and everyone else,
but I'm meeting

211
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,140
someone I haven't seen
in a very long time tonight.

212
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,780
-Someone I loved.
-Philippe?

213
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,460
-How do you know that?
-I have a good memory.

214
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,660
One night which you don't remember,
you told me everything.

215
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,460
But you didn't tell me if he loved
you. If he still loves you.

216
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,260
If things were that simple,

217
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,740
he'd be my daughter's father.

218
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,940
-What a pretty dress!
-Isn't it? It's not to dazzle him,

219
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,620
but I don't want to embarrass him.
He became very rich.

220
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,380
And since he's a psychologist,

221
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,220
Egyptologist or so on,
he guessed I was very rich, too.

222
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,700
He's leaving tomorrow,

223
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,820
so I want him to have the same
peace of mind I have for him.

224
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,300
My wallet is gone!

225
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,220
You can search me!

226
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,060
Excuse me,
but are you sure you didn't

227
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,260
-lose it before coming here?
-I am!

228
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,060
It was in my pocket. I'm sure of it!

229
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,220
-Did you have a lot of money?
-No, not much.

230
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,220
Maybe 40 or 50,000 francs.

231
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,100
It must have been this gentleman
who was with us.

232
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,580
-Do you know him?
-Mr. Philippe?

233
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,020
Yes, Mr. Philippe.

234
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,460
Wait for me here.

235
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,220
HOTEL OFFICE

236
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,620
-Is anyone here?
-Yes.

237
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,220
Hello, Mr. Philippe.

238
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,780
Yes, I'm leaving Paris,
I'm in a hurry. Give me the bill.

239
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,820
-You're paying your bill?
-That's why I'm asking you.

240
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,180
I'd asked you before,
but you always had another idea.

241
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
I know. It's easy words.

242
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,820
I knew you would.
You have nice luggage.

243
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,420
Yes. I'll take the train
right away and go far.

244
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,300
-If any mail came in...
-You never get any.

245
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,940
All the more reason
not to forward it!

246
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,380
You have to fall asleep now.

247
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,740
Well...

248
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,700
she wants a doll now,

249
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,780
a dancer. And with a tutu!

250
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,380
Hurry up. You're running late!

251
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,060
We're neighbors.
She might as well be here.

252
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,940
I'll handle the dancer.
Kids are easy.

253
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,740
Nice, isn't it?

254
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,860
Since it was Mr. Arthur Bacon
of the British Museum who sent you,

255
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,980
I'm glad you like it here.

256
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,060
Alas, I'm leaving tomorrow.

257
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,380
I am indeed happy, as we
haven't heard from Mr. Arthur Bacon

258
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,620
in a long time.

259
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,300
-Yes.
-The last news was pretty bad.

260
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,500
Oh, really?

261
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,740
Yes, we had the unfortunate surprise
of reading his name, two years ago,

262
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,460
in the obituaries section.

263
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,660
The papers...

264
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,500
For fake news... they fear no one.

265
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,940
Especially when they're bad.
But Arthur is a nomad!

266
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,620
He's not ready
to take his last journey yet.

267
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,100
-Glad to hear it.
-The last time I saw him,

268
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,380
it was in Cairo.

269
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,260
I'm going back there tomorrow,
by plane.

270
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,940
-Don't forget to wake me up.
-No, no.

271
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,620
Say,

272
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,180
do you think it's entirely necessary
for me to dress up for dinner?

273
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,100
-No, I'm afraid no one does anymore.
-No.

274
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,060
You won't be the only one.

275
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,260
"Midnight.

276
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,340
"Like the big needle
with the little one."

277
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,180
"We'll be together at midnight."

278
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,060
-You haven't forgotten.
-No.

279
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,260
-Not even the day you found it.
-I found it in a book.

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,420
It doesn't matter. It was a good
find anyway. I liked it.

281
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,260
Earlier, as I crossed
the Place Vendome,

282
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,100
I remembered the last day
we saw each other.

283
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,780
It was spring.

284
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,820
I was on Castiglione Street.
I was going to the studio.

285
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,020
You were waiting for me. We'd known
each other for three months.

286
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,940
We loved each other.

287
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,540
And to find you there so early,
since you're not an early person,

288
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,100
it meant a lot to me.

289
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,060
You took me by the arm and said:

290
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,180
"I guess you won't be working today."

291
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,820
Then we headed for the Tuileries,

292
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,860
and we both walked
without saying anything.

293
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,460
Then we stopped
by the wooden horse arena

294
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,700
where, for the first time...

295
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,180
...we kissed.

296
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,100
It was winter. It was a bit cold.

297
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,780
You told me you were leaving
for Egypt that evening,

298
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,620
for a great archaeology project,

299
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,700
but that, of course, you'd come back,
and we'd get married.

300
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,380
And I walked you to the station.
It was our honeymoon.

301
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,620
But you left me on the platform.

302
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,020
Anyway, what's done is done.

303
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,300
After all, if we'd stayed together,

304
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,300
we might not be here.

305
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,620
And your daughter

306
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,740
would be a little bigger.
I'd be her father.

307
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,620
We'd live in a modest dwelling
without any comfort.

308
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,660
-Does that make you laugh?
-Don't pay attention.

309
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,740
I think I'm a bit lost.

310
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,860
-In memories?
-No.

311
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,940
I'm just happy to be here.

312
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,100
Is the man,

313
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,540
the lavish man you live with,

314
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,820
keen on traveling as well?

315
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,660
Are you thinking about him tonight?

316
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,860
No, I forgot about him tonight.

317
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,860
That's nice.

318
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,340
-Forget him, too.
-Done.

319
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,420
You know, tonight, I have a lot
to forget along with him.

320
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,300
Have you suffered?

321
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
Yes.

322
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,820
As little as possible,
every time I couldn't do otherwise.

323
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,700
Suffering on purpose is disgusting.

324
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,300
Well, for years,

325
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,020
my life wasn't easy.

326
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,660
-Are you still into fashion?
-Yes.

327
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,540
I was a model.

328
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,620
I even posed for fashion magazines.

329
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,900
For painters, too.

330
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,580
Don't you think I had my share
of hardships over there, too,

331
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,300
at least at first?

332
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,580
Another bottle.

333
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,220
Egypt is beautiful,
but it's not always paradise for me.

334
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,860
Well, you know me.

335
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,540
A bit. Do you still drink too much?

336
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,620
Less, but I drink better stuff.

337
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,500
And I have the means to choose.

338
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,780
But before,

339
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,540
it was pretty painful,
even a little sleazy.

340
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,100
For an Egyptologist,
I was driving tourists around.

341
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,300
I wasn't showing them
the pyramids, the Nile...

342
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,180
No. Cairo at night was my specialty.

343
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,540
Even...

344
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,620
To be honest, an American tourist,

345
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,420
a fat tourist who wanted to have fun,

346
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,180
I borrowed from him, on the sly,

347
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,100
discretely,

348
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,660
the very modest sum of 55,000 francs.

349
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,740
But...

350
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,900
It was the first and last time
something like that happened to me.

351
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,300
I did it for a very beautiful girl.

352
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,580
Very beautiful but too rich.

353
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,660
And for nothing in the world
did I want her to suspect

354
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,300
that I was in a situation that was,
to say the least, precarious.

355
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,300
I mean, lousy...

356
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,340
Desperate...

357
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,860
Did you love her?

358
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,980
You're the only one I've ever loved.

359
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,580
-Did you marry her?
-No.

360
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,780
I would've liked to, of course.
But...

361
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,940
But what?

362
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,060
I married another.

363
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,620
She's a lovely woman.

364
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,380
A real little sphinx

365
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,460
with unprecedented luxury.

366
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,140
Do you love her?

367
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,100
I've always loved luxury.

368
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,460
-It's late.
-No one is waiting for you...

369
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,620
Yes, Yvette is.

370
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,340
Little girls get up early,
especially on Christmas Day.

371
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,620
-Do you have your car?
-Yes.

372
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,420
That one.

373
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,940
But I'd like to walk a bit.

374
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,340
Tuileries.

375
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,380
-Do you live far?
-It doesn't matter.

376
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,940
I'd like to...

377
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,140
I'd like to... I don't know.

378
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,180
I would like to get some fresh air,

379
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,500
walk alone for a bit,

380
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,220
-to take my mind off things.
-Alone?

381
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,980
Were you not happy with me?

382
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,500
Too happy.

383
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,940
Wait for me a little.

384
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,060
Look, this may be silly,

385
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,940
but I just made a bet,

386
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,340
so I'd like you to leave, now.

387
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,540
Not far,

388
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,300
just around the block.

389
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,380
For your eyes?

390
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,700
-I didn't say that.
-I did, because they're pretty.

391
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,420
What a pity that we're going
our separate ways again,

392
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,340
both of us,

393
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,980
-on a trip.
-A honeymoon trip?

394
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,380
She looks like you.

395
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,860
I didn't pose for that one.

396
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,820
You still look like her.

397
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,260
You have a good memory.

398
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,700
I sure do.

399
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,740
Philippe,

400
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,700
kiss me.

401
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,380
-You know I'm leaving for Cairo.
-Of course.

402
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,780
Of course,
it's not paradise every day,

403
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,260
it's not spring every day,

404
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,820
but it's nice and happy.

405
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,460
A happy night

406
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,940
is a loving memory that
can light up an entire life.

407
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,380
That's pretty.

408
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
-Who is it from?
-It's from you.

409
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,300
Well, it's for you
because I said it thinking of you.

410
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,740
So?

411
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,900
Not even this dress is yours?

412
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,300
No. No but give it to me anyway.

413
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,100
Thank you.

414
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,620
-What about your car?
-My car?

415
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,500
It was Cinderella's carriage.

416
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,860
You know, things that appear
and disappear just as quickly.

417
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,820
What about your driver?

418
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,500
I simply asked him to go
around the block, for my eyes.

419
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,540
I never would've thought of that.

420
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,740
Yes, but tell me...

421
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,700
Why did you hide the truth?

422
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,780
Maybe it's silly,
but I didn't want to embarrass you.

423
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,900
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

424
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,660
Yes, you're a wonderful girl.
I understand.

425
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,100
All right...

426
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,140
Can you help me?

427
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,260
So why did you tell me the truth?

428
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,460
I had nothing left to hide.

429
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,380
Hold on.

430
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,380
Hello?

431
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,380
What? The plane?

432
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,140
Yes, of course!

433
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,820
It's time!

434
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,100
Run up my bill.

435
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,220
Done? Great! How much?

436
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,980
All right, perfect, perfect.

437
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,660
For peanuts...

438
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,220
There.

439
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,020
-What was it about?
-The plane.

440
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,660
It's almost time. But I'm early.

441
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,540
-What I would like to do...
-What would you like?

442
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,980
To drive you home.

443
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,540
That way,
if I ever come back to Paris...

444
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,380
If you want to see me again,
you'll know where I am.

445
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,260
I would know you hadn't changed.

446
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,860
-Still, I do feel bad.
-Why?

447
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,500
Because I love you.

448
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,420
Since you're surely as delicate
as you once were,

449
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,780
if I offered to help you...

450
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,220
You know I'd refuse.

451
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,700
Besides, I can't complain.
I'm very happy with my daughter.

452
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,380
Of course, I work.

453
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,660
But you know, I always have.

454
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,020
Mommy!

455
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,420
You're ugly!

456
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,380
Still, life isn't fair.

457
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,500
For example,
imagine if we lived together.

458
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,700
I too would be...

459
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,260
economically weak like you.

460
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,660
-Maybe we'd be happy.
-No, no.

461
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,860
Certainly derisory.

462
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,140
If we lived together happily
and without a penny,

463
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,460
at some point, I'd be an asshole.

464
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,220
-With me?
-By force of circumstance.

465
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,620
But with others, out of necessity.

466
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Being an asshole
to the woman you love,

467
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,180
even if you aren't one deep down,

468
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,660
that's far too much.

469
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,100
What do you think?

470
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,980
I'm thinking about someone
who used to say:

471
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,420
"No money, no problems".

472
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,340
-It made me laugh at the time.
-What about now?

473
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,900
It still does.

474
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,260
Well, maybe everything will fall
into place with a little bit of luck.

475
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,420
Imagine that my wife leaves me
and I'm ruined.

476
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,780
Money wounds aren't fatal, I hear.

477
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,780
Maybe I'd get better.
Then I'd come back.

478
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,420
Here?

479
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,620
Yes, here.

480
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
Mommy!

481
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,540
My little dancer!

482
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,460
I met Santa Claus.
He gave me this for you.

483
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,260
Where are you going?

484
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,620
-Orly.
-No.

485
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,980
Isn't it where the plane is?

486
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,980
No, I changed my mind.
I'm just going south

487
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,180
to spend the holidays.

488
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,420
-To end the year in style!
-As you say.

489
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,420
So the Lyon Station?

490
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,140
That one or another...

491
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,420
The Lyon Station is best to go south.

492
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,580
In style...

493
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,180
You might be more right
than you think.

494
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,540
Last night was how
my beautiful year ended.

495
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,620
It hadn't started well, though.

496
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,940
Don't even tell me
about the next one,

497
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,300
what a happy new year it'll be.

498
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,940
Don't complain.
You'll start it in the sun.

499
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,420
Or in the shade.

500
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Santa is nice.
He didn't forget me.

501
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,380
Yes, he's nice in his own way.

502
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,460
Especially on Christmas night.
It's his day, so he's happy.

503
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,620
And he wishes it
to all those he loves,

504
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,020
to everyone he thinks he loves.

505
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,300
Will he be back next year?

506
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Maybe.

507
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,540
Perhaps the crime is the revenge
of the beasts we have killed.

508
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,140
This wreath, which seems to be
the end of this story,

509
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,740
is really just the beginning
of the next one.

510
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,700
Liliane, don't cry.
Isn't it beautiful?

511
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,260
It is. That's just it.

512
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,540
-Do you like it?
-A lot.

513
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,460
We're leaving each other
on a good note, aren't we?

514
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,900
This is all my fault.

515
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,780
When I saw you,
I got dizzy right away.

516
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,860
What an effect you had on me!

517
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,860
You're not even handsome.

518
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,460
I thought I was meant to be
with Jean-Marie before.

519
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:11,580
Not at all! It was you. It's funny.

520
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,460
Can't you try and stay?

521
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,460
What if I get arrested
and get 15 years?

522
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,260
What good would it do?

523
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,260
I have to enlist.

524
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,780
Tomorrow, at this time,
I'll be in Marseille.

525
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,060
You know who I am. I'm a hunted man.

526
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,820
My darling little rogue.

527
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,700
You know, I wrote it all down.

528
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,220
-What did you write down?
-Yes, on my calendar.

529
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,980
Since the first minute.

530
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,860
That's nice!

531
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,940
"Sunday, May 17: met Jean-Pierre
at the movies in the morning.

532
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,460
"He put his hand on my right thigh.

533
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,500
"Fresnay was playing in Mr. Vincent".
That's right!

534
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,820
"I closed my eyes.
The movie was very short.

535
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,060
"At the end, Jean-Pierre
kissed me on the neck.

536
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,700
"I let him do it. I asked
Jean-Marie for forgiveness.

537
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,980
"He bought me lunch.
We ate the same thing:

538
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,660
"sausage, butter, veal chop,
beans, gruyere, custard.

539
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,260
"We went home together.

540
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,980
"It was barely 10:00 p.m.
when we went to bed.

541
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,540
"Then he...".

542
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,140
-Did I do that?
-Keep going. It's not over.

543
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,380
Yes. "We fell asleep at 4:00 a.m..."

544
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,700
Oh my!

545
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,780
"At 5:00 a.m., he woke me and..."

546
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,380
Again?

547
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,140
I'm amazing!

548
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,300
But it's over. There will only be
blank pages in my calendar now.

549
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,980
Listen, Liliane, don't get emotional.
Am I crying?

550
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,460
And yet, I'm leaving you.
Are you leaving yourself?

551
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,460
You'll still sleep with yourself.

552
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,940
In the meantime, I'll be
one, two, one, two.

553
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,780
I'll go from Gafsa to Tataouine.

554
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,660
I'll smell like warm sand,
and with you in mind, my love,

555
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,460
I'll sing the melancholic song
of the wheaten with the others.

556
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,540
Here's some blood sausage
Here's some blood sausage

557
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,660
What's that?

558
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,460
That's the legion song,
don't you know?

559
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,220
For Alsatians, Swiss and Lorrainers

560
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,780
-That's funny.
-Let's sing together!

561
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,940
Here's some blood sausage
Here's some blood sausage

562
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,940
It's too sad.

563
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,780
No, it's happy!
It'll be our love song.

564
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,340
Get up. You'll be late.
You have five minutes left.

565
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,620
I wonder what pleasure
you can have, sir,

566
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,660
in pretending to be someone
else to these ladies.

567
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,780
I don't want to be loved for myself.

568
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,860
I want to be loved for what I'm not.

569
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,300
Your impostures, sir,
are no less regrettable.

570
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,420
Regrettable?
You have a short memory, Armand.

571
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,620
The few times I've had the temerity
to be loved under my real name,

572
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,500
you weren't very proud.
Neither was I, actually.

573
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,220
I can't be blamed for anything.

574
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,380
Liliane, whom I just left,
will have been loved

575
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,300
at least once in her life
by a unique character.

576
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,900
She had her piece of a dream.

577
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,540
She'll look with melancholy
at the little ring he gave her

578
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,820
before leaving forever

579
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
where a tragic fate awaits him.

580
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,260
-What ring?
-Grandma's ring.

581
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,780
You gave her Grandma's ring, sir?

582
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,420
But it was a real diamond!

583
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,300
Something had to be real
in this story!

584
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,940
Take a left!
To the Champs-Elysees, go!

585
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,620
Sir, remember that
your uncle's funeral is later today.

586
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,100
-Are you sure it's today?
-I am, sir.

587
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,940
You wouldn't think of being buried
in weather like this.

588
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,380
It's not even raining.

589
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,700
You know me and funerals...
I like the racetrack better.

590
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,300
At least you know what you're losing.

591
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,780
Are you serious, sir?

592
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,460
I can't stand my uncle!

593
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,660
He's dead, sir.

594
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,780
All the more reason!
And he hated me.

595
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,020
He was a mean guy.

596
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,020
Do you have a black suit, sir?

597
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,020
They'll get what they get.

598
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,540
Thankfully, I took precautions.

599
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,580
I also bought a wreath.

600
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,180
-No, Armand! No, crazy purchases!
-On sale, sir.

601
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,820
Half off.

602
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,740
It must be nice.

603
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,260
You'll see it, sir.
It's being delivered this morning.

604
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,740
What is this?

605
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,820
Your latest songs.

606
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,620
That's the record I made as a joke!

607
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,140
That was nice!

608
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,860
It's a surprise for my girlfriends.

609
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,780
We remember the good memories!

610
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,340
It's an all-purpose record.

611
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,340
Listen, I think it's pretty good.
You'll give me your opinion.

612
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,820
I'm very interested.

613
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Hello!

614
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,820
It's me again.

615
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,780
Hello!

616
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,860
Don't look for me.

617
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,340
I'm here, embedded in the wax.

618
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,060
Do you know that
you're still as pretty, as lovely,

619
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,140
and you don't look like anyone?

620
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,660
Your eyes that go in pairs,

621
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,660
your boobs, too,

622
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,740
your lips that are
sometimes four when I add mine.

623
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,020
See?

624
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,020
All that, my love...

625
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:38,700
Very nice, sir,
but we're running out of time.

626
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,260
Very nice, sir,
but we're running out of time.

627
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,900
We'll be late for the funeral.

628
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,820
I don't want to go!

629
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,380
It's not usually for pleasure.

630
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,380
Only the dead guy amuses me.

631
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,380
But he's not worth the trouble.

632
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,580
And will they even notice my absence?

633
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,020
Your uncle's widow,
whose grief is certainly deep,

634
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,580
-will not be able to...
-The widow? But my poor Armand,

635
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,420
it's the best day of her life!

636
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,540
Everyone knows that she's been
the mistress of my uncle's secretary,

637
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,980
her husband, for three years!

638
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,940
No way! Mr. Gustave?

639
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,060
Yes, Mr. Gustave!

640
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,900
A fine scoundrel, by the way.

641
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,380
What is this?
It's awful!

642
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,820
That'll be me in ten minutes.

643
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,180
What kind of hat is this?

644
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,740
It's a loan!

645
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,340
-A loan?
-Yes, from the concierge.

646
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,140
It belonged to her husband,

647
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,380
who himself belonged to the police.

648
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,020
She didn't give you the moustache
that went with it?

649
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,580
Let's see.

650
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,940
She should've lent me
her husband's head, too!

651
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,420
You can hold it.

652
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,260
I had better, yes.

653
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,460
What a small head I have!

654
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,140
-That explains a lot!
-Armand!

655
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,220
So where were you?
At the business ball?

656
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,660
Can't you hear the doorbell?

657
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,820
What's in your ears?
A shock absorber?

658
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,340
Is this Mr. Jean-Pierre
Delagrange's residence?

659
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,780
Yes.

660
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,540
This double-sided figure,
that saddleback look,

661
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,900
that crooked smile
borrowed from a dentist!

662
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,980
I do have the right address!
This is Jean-Pierre Delagrange's!

663
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,020
If I looked like that,
I'd wear closed pants.

664
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,140
I recognize you! He told me
about you. Your name is Armand!

665
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,380
You look like it, too.

666
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,340
I wouldn't trust you
with my little sister.

667
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,700
-Carcassonne!
-Carca...

668
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,460
-Excuse me?
-Carcassonne, doesn't ring a bell?

669
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,700
He never told you about me,
of course.

670
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,100
I'm not a topic of conversation.

671
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,500
-Ma'am...
-Ma'am?

672
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,900
Be polite! What do you take me for?

673
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,860
Ma'am? Not ma'am, miss!

674
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,500
Your boss is handsome.
But he'll get what's coming to him!

675
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,660
Smile, buddy, smile.
Enjoy it. Enjoy it!

676
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,180
It's an occasion...

677
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,860
Well, what are you standing around
like a fishing rod on a bank for?

678
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,540
Are you waiting for it to bite?

679
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,180
Announce me, please!
Carcassonne!

680
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,220
-But...
-Don't you want to? I'll go myself!

681
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,860
Please, miss, calm down!
Calm down and we'll see.

682
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,100
But I am calm. I am very calm.

683
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,140
I am extremely calm.
Know this, poor Armand,

684
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,940
that if I was not, I would've
broken everything, starting with you!

685
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,220
Remember this.

686
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,980
-It's June 24, isn't it?
-Yes.

687
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,860
When were the September massacres?

688
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,780
The mass...

689
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,220
But I don't blame you, miss.
On the contrary.

690
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,460
-Carcassonne is a very nice town.
-Silence!

691
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,780
I'll count to 100!
One, two, three,

692
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,500
-four, five!
-Miss.

693
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,180
Six, seven, eight,

694
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,500
nine, ten, eleven...

695
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,580
What was it?

696
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,260
Carcassonne!

697
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,660
What about Carcassonne?

698
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,500
A lady asked me to say
"Carcassonne" to you, sir.

699
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,940
Carcassonne?

700
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,980
Carcassonne is not very lively.
She's keeping her hand in her bag.

701
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,060
I'm sure she has a gun
and wants to get rid of you, sir.

702
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,980
A gun, it's Suzy!

703
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,300
She never knew whether
to kill herself or me.

704
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,180
She seems to have made her choice.

705
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,540
One of the few women
I was sincere with!

706
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,660
You see... the reward.
You didn't tell her I was here?

707
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,220
I'm used to it, sir, but she seems
determined to camp out here.

708
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,580
-What is she doing right now?
-Counting to 100.

709
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,180
To... Listen, Armand, do you like me?

710
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,460
-Really?
-Yes.

711
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,900
Do what you want, lie if you must,

712
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,980
but she has to leave.

713
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,660
She must!

714
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,300
She...

715
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,500
94,

716
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,740
95.

717
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,340
Is this the Delagrange residence?

718
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,580
-Yes.
-It's the wreath for Mr. Delagrange.

719
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,940
-A wreath?
-Yes, ma'am.

720
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,180
Indeed...

721
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,780
Alas...

722
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,260
It can't be.

723
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,740
Since you've guessed, miss,

724
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,700
I can tell you that he is no more.

725
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,620
He's not?

726
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,460
Your wish came true, miss.

727
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,780
He died without your help.

728
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,700
Enough, enough! Don't make it worse!

729
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,340
I didn't know what I was saying, sir!

730
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,660
You say you'll kill someone,

731
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,020
but if you do it every time,

732
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,340
no one will be left.

733
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,700
My Jean-Pierre!

734
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,580
My Jeannot! My darling Pierrot...

735
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,780
I don't want to leave you
with a bad impression!

736
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,300
I'm going to join you, right now.

737
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,820
Adieu, Pierrot.

738
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,500
Come on, come on! Give me that!
Give me that right now!

739
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,740
You brute!

740
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,140
Where do you think you are?

741
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,980
One death is not enough for you?
Do you need two?

742
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,460
Let me kill myself
since that's what I want!

743
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,100
Not here! Elsewhere, if you like.
Go kill yourself at home.

744
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,220
Why didn't you tell me right away
that Jean-Pierre was dead?

745
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,940
Out of thoughtfulness!

746
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,700
To spare you grief.

747
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,460
How did he die?

748
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,660
With his family.

749
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,540
When's the funeral?

750
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,820
Today.

751
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,900
-Already?
-Youth has to happen.

752
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,700
-Your name is Suzy, right?
-Yes.

753
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,980
Alas...

754
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,740
-Suzy...
-It was his last word.

755
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,660
Really? He's so nice!

756
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,420
He did not dare write to you.
He felt unworthy.

757
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,540
Yes. No!

758
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,540
Come on, how silly of him!

759
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,180
He said: "Happiness
is not big enough for her.

760
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,780
"We'd have to come up
with something." So...

761
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,260
He was looking! He was looking!

762
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,260
The brain did not hold.
That's what he died of.

763
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,820
Meningitis, lightning fast,
you could say.

764
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,500
-Scum!
-Huh?

765
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,060
-Scoundrel!
-Huh?

766
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,180
Wretch! You hear? I'm a wretch!

767
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,700
I'll pay for this.

768
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,060
I will pay with my life.
That'll teach me!

769
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,020
No, you have to live,

770
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,940
so he can live
in your memories of him.

771
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,180
Don't blame yourself.

772
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,820
-No!
-Leave in peace, miss.

773
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,020
-Goodbye, miss.
-Goodbye, sir.

774
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,340
You're right!

775
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,420
You're never quite dead
when those who love you live on.

776
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,100
I'd like to see the place where
he lived. Show me his room.

777
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,380
It would be too painful.
You're too emotional.

778
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,380
I've come to terms with his death.
Show me his room!

779
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,500
So be it...

780
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,740
Come in, Ms. Suzy,

781
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,980
come in his room!

782
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,220
I didn't touch anything.
I wanted the room to remain exactly

783
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,420
as he left it.

784
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,500
It looks like
he'll be back any minute.

785
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,260
My little silk pajamas!

786
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,820
-What's over here?
-That's the bathroom.

787
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,460
But it's a mess.

788
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,540
I drew myself a bath
before heading to the funeral.

789
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,140
To think he looked at himself
in that mirror every day!

790
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,820
He called me his "little razor."

791
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,140
He was very good with faces.

792
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,380
And here's the studio

793
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,700
where he worked
when he was still alive.

794
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,580
That's where he wrote his songs.

795
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,620
It is.

796
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,860
He didn't even finish his last hit.

797
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,340
What a pity!

798
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,140
He was so talented!

799
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,140
It's so beautiful!

800
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,180
Who's playing the accordion?

801
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,220
It's Leon...

802
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,540
Who's playing the trumpet?

803
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,180
It's Anael

804
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,860
Who's playing the kazoo?

805
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,380
It's Gaston

806
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,180
Who's playing the trombone?

807
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,580
It's Simon

808
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,420
It's moving.

809
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,020
Only he could come up
with such ideas.

810
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,380
Only him!

811
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,780
Bless you.

812
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,940
I was so looking forward
to seeing him again.

813
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,020
-Now my life is...
-You're still young.

814
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,700
I was young ten minutes ago!

815
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,260
Now...

816
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,820
Now I could be your mother, Armand.

817
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,500
One last look in his bedroom!

818
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,820
-Again?
-Yes.

819
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:10,380
Will you stop flirting with my wife?

820
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,660
Don't you dare shush me!

821
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,620
What's this show you're putting on?

822
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,380
I'll kick your ass! I will!

823
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,780
I'll get you!

824
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,260
And here his view when he'd wake up.

825
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,540
His little terrace...

826
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,820
And the idiot acting like a fool!

827
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,740
Always the same thing...

828
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,580
The good ones always leave first!

829
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,340
And the bad ones stay!

830
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,940
You, up there, I'll remember this!

831
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,940
-Who?
-God! It's all He does.

832
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,660
-Adieu, Armand!
-Adieu, miss.

833
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,780
My bag...

834
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,740
Hello! It's me.

835
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,860
I'm back. Hello!

836
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,780
Don't look for me.

837
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,660
-I'm here.
-Can you hear this?

838
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,020
Can you?

839
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,300
No, miss.
I can't hear anything.

840
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,300
His little voice!

841
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,380
His little voice just for me!

842
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,620
Miss!

843
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,340
-My poor friend!
-He liked you, you know.

844
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,380
How long has it been, ma'am?

845
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,060
Thank you for your beautiful wreath.
Yes, yes, you spoiled him!

846
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,100
That's the least I could do.

847
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,220
Do you know Mr. Gustave Chartin?

848
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,940
Jean-Pierre's secretary.

849
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,860
Yes, we met under better
circumstances, I'm afraid.

850
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,260
At the opera, at the intermission,
you were with Mrs. Delagrange.

851
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,180
Yes, indeed.

852
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,860
It was a lovely show.

853
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,940
Lovely.

854
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,660
He didn't suffer too much, I hope?

855
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,020
Not in the least.
Isn't that right? It went very well.

856
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,900
Good thing.
He was so afraid of death!

857
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,860
Yes, it was a good surprise.

858
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,580
I mean...

859
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,780
He was sitting there listening
to the radio and suddenly...

860
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,340
He didn't realize anything.

861
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,180
He thought it was
a technical accident.

862
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,500
It's a wonderful way to die.

863
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,620
He died in good health.

864
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,780
We are so insignificant.

865
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,820
Michel! I'm not too late, am I?

866
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,620
We'll leave in five minutes, sir.

867
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,540
Perfect, buddy, perfect.

868
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,500
You're already leaving?

869
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,780
Hello, cousin.
No, I have to talk to the priest.

870
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:52,660
Really?

871
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,500
-Can you believe it?
-What's wrong?

872
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,900
-His death!
-My uncle! I know about that!

873
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,500
He took all the regret with him.

874
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,020
Yes, he took away all our regrets
and left us none.

875
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,300
See you soon, cousin.
Auntie...

876
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,580
You're late.

877
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,740
Good things I'm here!
I almost died, too.

878
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,780
What happened?

879
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,820
I'll tell you about it later,
but it was this close.

880
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,980
Gustave, buddy!

881
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,460
You look tired.

882
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,140
I spent all night with your aunt.

883
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,660
That, of course, is very tiring.

884
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,020
Hello, how are you? Hi.

885
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,060
You could have come earlier.
You act so casually!

886
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,380
Please don't ruin my day, OK?

887
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,020
At ease!

888
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,860
This is Mr. Moussenard.
Jean-Pierre Delagrange.

889
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,900
Jean-Pierre Delagrange!

890
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,460
Don't worry.

891
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,500
My name is Jean-Pierre too,
but I'm not in that coffin!

892
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,860
It' must be a funny feeling.

893
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,580
Very funny.

894
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,580
I really liked your uncle.

895
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,780
-Really?
-Just imagine,

896
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,500
we were born the same year.
We went to law school together.

897
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,060
We got married on the same day.

898
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,220
We graduated in the same class.

899
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,860
We always followed each other.

900
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,380
Well, I hope it continues.
Sorry!

901
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,820
Gentlemen?

902
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,060
Yes.

903
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,140
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, miss.

904
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,380
Suzie Henebey.

905
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,300
And you are?

906
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,820
I'm the hotel manager.

907
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,180
Nice to meet you, sir.

908
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,020
But? What are you...

909
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,180
What are you doing in my room?
Did you at least respect me?

910
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,060
You don't think I...

911
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,540
Don't be rude!

912
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,420
I don't think anything!

913
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,420
I'm just asking! Answer yes or no!

914
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,580
No, miss.

915
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,580
"No, miss."
It's nothing to brag about!

916
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:05,060
By the way... By the way...

917
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:06,980
It's amazing!

918
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,180
-What is it, miss?
-I'm not fainting anymore!

919
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,500
Obviously.

920
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,260
Couldn't you say so?

921
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,900
I remember now.

922
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,900
But who brought me back here?

923
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,060
A tall gentleman who said
he'd found your address in your bag.

924
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,740
He gave you to the doorman, who
gave you to the baggage handler,

925
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,860
and I got you to your room.

926
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,620
How long was I out?

927
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,420
About 45 minutes.

928
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:35,140
Do you know where the funeral is?

929
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,540
What funeral?

930
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,660
What funeral?
Jean-Pierre Delagrange's funeral!

931
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,260
I don't know.
All you have to do is call.

932
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,700
Just call...

933
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,300
Hello? Hello?

934
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,820
Good thing I'm here.
I don't know what I'd do without me.

935
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,980
Hello, miss? The cemeteries, please.

936
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,220
Yes, all the cemeteries.

937
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,060
Here, hold the phone.
I'll get dressed.

938
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,620
There's my dress.

939
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,860
He was so nice!

940
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,300
A boy like that is extremely rare,

941
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,820
especially in this day and age.

942
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,460
What are you looking at me for?
Where do you think you are?

943
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,380
With the grief I have,
I have other things to think about!

944
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,340
Hello? This is
the Pere Lachaise Cemetery, miss.

945
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,340
Hello? Pere Lachaise?

946
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,780
Would you put me through to
the concierge? It's for information.

947
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,380
Hello?

948
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,420
Are you receiving
Mr. Jean-Pierre Delagrange today?

949
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,420
Delagrange, in one word.

950
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,260
No?

951
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,300
No?

952
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,140
I'm very sorry.

953
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,860
Hello? Hello, miss?

954
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,660
Next one, please!

955
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,820
Jean-Pierre, you can turn around

956
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,300
and look back
on your accomplished work,

957
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,020
because if you leave us,

958
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,540
it's without owing us anything.

959
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,060
You retire after making a fortune.

960
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,340
Finance is also an art.

961
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,260
If numbers have their eloquence,

962
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,420
they also have their poetry.

963
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,300
Stock market speculations

964
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,380
are also intellectual speculations.

965
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,780
They are not just a money game

966
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,660
but a mind game.

967
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,340
Yes, my friends,

968
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,780
Jean-Pierre Delagrange was
in his own way an artist,

969
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,860
a poet, a musician, finally,

970
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,020
because he was running
his business like a maestro!

971
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,900
Jean-Pierre...

972
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,660
It may seem irreverent
to speak like this over a grave,

973
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,580
but your grave
is not like the others,

974
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,380
because you're not just
another dead man.

975
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,740
You are a dead man standing!

976
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:49,780
You're a living dead.

977
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,420
No, no regrets, no tears, no sorrow!

978
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,300
We're not saying goodbye because
even far from us, you are present.

979
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,260
Present! It is the cry of the soldier
always ready to do his duty.

980
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,740
Present in joy and sorrow!

981
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,100
Present in our regrets!
Present in our hopes!

982
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,220
Present in the past!
Present in the future!

983
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,860
Present in the present!

984
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,060
We won't conjugate you in
the past definite or imperfect tense!

985
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,980
Only one time for you: the present!

986
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,860
Death may be strong,
implacable and uncompromising,

987
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,700
but she can't make you disappear!

988
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,340
Your work is there, continuing you,
affirming you, fulfilling you,

989
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,380
testifying of you, demonstrating you,

990
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,660
that proves, verifies, certifies
and makes you clear.

991
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,740
It scrutinizes, discounts
and credits you,

992
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,460
defines you! Yes!

993
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,620
Defines you, Jean-Pierre!

994
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,300
My love...
How true, my darling!

995
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,300
-She said "darling."
-Did he have a mistress?

996
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,780
Where you are, be happy.

997
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,300
You, whose eyes have only closed

998
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,540
to be see inside yourself.

999
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,700
Adieu, Jeannot! Adieu, my love!

1000
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,220
Adieu, my life!

1001
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,060
It's me, Suzy,

1002
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,220
your little Suzy, your Suzinette!

1003
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,300
Please don't stay here, miss.

1004
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,020
Come with me.

1005
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,700
Follow me, ladies and gentlemen.

1006
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,540
Be reasonable!
If everyone did what you do...

1007
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,340
Your uncle had a mistress.

1008
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,700
-No? No kidding?
-Yes, she's here.

1009
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,460
She's at the grave.
They can't move her.

1010
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,460
What did she say?

1011
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,700
How is she?

1012
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,020
Amazing. She'll come shake your hand.

1013
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,540
Bravo!

1014
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,740
Thank you. I'm very touched
by what you have just said.

1015
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,820
That is some consolation.

1016
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,700
-Did you hear?
-I did!

1017
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,540
-Amazing!
-Only here!

1018
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,500
Two widows! This is really
a first class funeral!

1019
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,020
-My condolences.
-Sir!

1020
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,140
-Have you heard, sir?
-Have I!

1021
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,340
You shouldn't stay here!

1022
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,020
Why? I want to see her!

1023
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,420
-What if she makes a scene?
-All the more reason!

1024
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,740
Come on, it's really funny!

1025
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,380
Ma'am! You only you knew...

1026
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,100
To lose such a beautiful boy,
it's sad for a mother's heart!

1027
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,580
Ma'am, your son was an elite soul.

1028
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,580
My son?
She went to the wrong funeral!

1029
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,300
You're staying here!

1030
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,060
You're not leaving until the end!

1031
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,660
I need to talk to Armand!

1032
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,540
Don't you move!

1033
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,740
My condolences.

1034
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,580
Bastard! Bastard!

1035
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,700
My love... you're dead!

1036
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,180
You're dead!
You won't get away with this!

1037
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,420
-No, no.
-Armand! Armand!

1038
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:20,100
So, is he dead?
Is he dead?

1039
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,780
Answer her. Am I dead?

1040
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,020
-Did he tell you I was dead?
-Did he?

1041
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,900
Is he dead?

1042
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,300
Me? Dead? Me?
This is an abominable slander!

1043
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:33,180
I hope you didn't believe him?
Am I dead?

1044
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,940
I don't understand!
There is no possible explanation!

1045
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:40,540
Yes! He was paid by the family
to keep the intruder away!

1046
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,060
To separate us forever!

1047
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,860
Armand, is this true?
Tell me it's not true!

1048
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,140
You know how much I cared for Suzy,
how worried I was about her silence!

1049
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,620
It's kind of your fault.
Why didn't you answer my letters?

1050
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,860
-But I never received any letters.
-What?

1051
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,780
-Never!
-Do you hear that, Armand?

1052
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,620
But I've always
sent your letters, sir!

1053
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:59,580
So I'm a liar?

1054
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,740
Not another word! Go home!

1055
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,900
I'll deal with you tomorrow! Go!

1056
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,300
Good thing you were dead.
I was about to kill you!

1057
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,220
I wouldn't have survived you.

1058
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,740
In short, Armand saved our lives.

1059
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,820
That's true. Without him...

1060
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,900
We'll keep him, but we won't
give him any more letters to mail.

1061
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:22,100
He'll do it very well, as usual.

1062
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,980
And now we'll never leave
each other again.

1063
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:29,060
-Never again.
-I'm yours for life.

1064
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,580
-For life.
-And we'll always love each other.

1065
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:34,620
-Always.
-I'm so happy!

1066
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,220
I know.

1067
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,780
On second thought,
I think I lied to you.

1068
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,380
-What do you mean?
-I'm not a music composer.

1069
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,380
-Are you kidding?
-No.

1070
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,900
-I'm an explorer.
-Here we go again.

1071
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,500
I hunt lions in the Sahara.

1072
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,620
-I'll have to go back soon.
-I'll come with you!

1073
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,260
Oh dear! It's far too dangerous.

1074
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,380
What's this?

1075
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,620
Keep it. You never know.

1076
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,420
No, it's useless now.

1077
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:14,420
The morale of the story: to succeed
in love, you must know music.

1078
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,820
What does this
faux sable rabbit skin represent?

1079
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,900
Authentic news.

1080
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,060
You may recall the facts.
It was in all the papers at the time.

1081
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:33,540
On October 19th, Gerard de Narcay,
committed for the last four years

1082
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,780
at the request of his family
for his extravagance and prodigality,

1083
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:38,700
escaped from the asylum.

1084
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,460
It was a Thursday.

1085
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:45,140
The Comedie Francaise was playing
Le Misanthrope that morning.

1086
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,180
Julie Perrin played Celimene.

1087
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,820
She was about to go on stage.

1088
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:01,260
Crime at the Comedie Francaise!
Paris Presse!

1089
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:02,900
Paris Presse!

1090
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,980
Crime at the Comedie Francaise!
Thank you, sir!

1091
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:07,500
Julie Perrin strangled
in her dressing room!

1092
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,900
Crime at the Comedie Francaise!
Thank you, sir!

1093
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,900
Crime at the Comedie Francaise!

1094
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:23,180
JULIE PERRIN STRANGLED
IN HER DRESSING ROOM

1095
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,980
Two crimes in three hours.

1096
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,420
The police found out Julie Perrin
was Gerard de Narcay's mistress.

1097
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,660
They also knew Mr. Dalmet,
the second victim, was the notary

1098
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,220
of the demented man's family
and his perpetual guardian.

1099
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,700
There was no doubt on whom
the murderer was.

1100
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:47,300
But where was
the murderous madman lurking now,

1101
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,780
for whose capture the police
had promised a large reward?

1102
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,260
Hello? I'd like to speak
to Dr. Mansart, please.

1103
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,740
Thanks. I'll wait.

1104
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,460
Dr. Mansart!
You're wanted on the phone.

1105
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:45,820
Hello?

1106
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,220
Hello?

1107
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,380
Hello?

1108
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,580
Hello?

1109
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,060
It wasn't me. It was the notary.

1110
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,820
God rest his soul.

1111
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,700
-A man was just killed!
-What is it?

1112
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,740
A man was just killed!

1113
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:43,740
-Where?
-There's the killer!

1114
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,700
He's getting away!

1115
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,340
POLICE

1116
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,300
He shoved me. He went like
a madman towards the Seine!

1117
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,740
He went that way!

1118
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,580
It's not a good time yet.

1119
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,220
Now you can.

1120
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,420
It's safe now.

1121
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,860
If you were to call them,
they would come.

1122
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,420
Scream.

1123
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,140
-Scream!
-Go away!

1124
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,900
I'd like to.

1125
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,660
You could help me. Come with me!

1126
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:29,940
Leave me alone.
Why didn't you let me die?

1127
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,900
I've lost the nerve to do it now.

1128
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:35,180
Come with me. I'll help you die.

1129
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,540
You'll see, it's easy but later.
But definitely not that.

1130
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:42,220
I want to live. I have to live.

1131
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,900
A few more hours, one more task.
Come with me. You'll help me.

1132
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,700
Aren't you going to ask
why I'm wanted?

1133
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,940
I should be dead by now.

1134
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,900
Help me get through then.

1135
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,540
I'm wary of doors.

1136
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,740
They close and keep you prisoner.

1137
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:12,460
Are you praying?

1138
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,300
If it's for me, don't bother.
Christ is on my side.

1139
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,500
He has to be, since I was betrayed.

1140
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,940
He too was betrayed.

1141
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:24,460
He was locked up, just like me,

1142
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,620
in a tomb.

1143
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:33,220
But he escaped on the third day.

1144
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:35,980
It took me

1145
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,140
five years.

1146
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:48,940
Three times, Father.

1147
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:55,260
Priests are funny. They always
want to know how many times.

1148
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,900
Such accounting!

1149
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,660
"How many times, my child?"

1150
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,420
"Three times, Father.

1151
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:03,860
"I have delivered
justice three times.

1152
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,620
"Yes,

1153
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,180
"I punished them, Father.".

1154
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,580
My own justice.
I delivered it myself!

1155
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,420
Be quiet.

1156
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,820
My family locked me up

1157
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,340
to steal my money.

1158
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,820
I don't care about the money,

1159
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,860
but my freedom...

1160
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,220
It's awful.

1161
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,900
Five years

1162
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,260
like an animal in a cage behind bars.

1163
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,620
Hearing the screams
of the other victims in the cells...

1164
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,900
There was never any silence.

1165
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,180
It's abominable.

1166
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,420
I thought I was the most unhappy.

1167
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,900
The most painful thing
was those who laughed.

1168
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,100
They couldn't stop laughing,

1169
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,580
as if they were going crazy.

1170
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,940
Two more traitors to punish.

1171
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,860
Come on.

1172
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,180
Do you have a cigarette?

1173
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,980
Let me see.

1174
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,260
Thank you.

1175
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:50,260
What's wrong? Are you sick?

1176
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,700
Did you eat anything?

1177
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:55,380
I don't think so.

1178
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,900
This is where I lived.

1179
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,260
It's not very cheerful,
but you're safe here.

1180
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,940
Get some rest.
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

1181
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,780
Would you like some milk
in your coffee?

1182
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,420
What are you doing?

1183
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,820
Keys are ugly.

1184
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,980
They have teeth,

1185
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,740
one mean eye.

1186
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:55,700
That's true.

1187
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:58,660
Take off your coat. Rest a bit.

1188
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:03,860
Do you know what they did
to the king?

1189
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,780
-Which king?
-Louis XVI.

1190
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:09,780
He made keys, locks.

1191
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,820
Not for a living.
He was King of France.

1192
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,220
He was doing it to distract himself.

1193
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,540
Distract himself...

1194
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,100
from being king.

1195
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,060
They locked him up in a prison.

1196
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,300
Like me.

1197
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,220
Yes, I know.

1198
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,460
Then they cut off his head.

1199
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,860
No more head.

1200
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:57,660
Don't play with keys.

1201
01:16:57,860 --> 01:16:59,460
It's dangerous.

1202
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,860
Don't open it.

1203
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:04,420
It's bad luck.

1204
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,220
It was bad luck to the people
who locked him up.

1205
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,660
Thank you.

1206
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:15,700
We couldn't even try to pick
the lock to escape.

1207
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,340
We couldn't see it.

1208
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,260
We couldn't even see the door.

1209
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,420
Four walls,

1210
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:28,580
smooth walls.

1211
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,220
We couldn't even try to kill
ourselves against the walls.

1212
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,740
They were padded.

1213
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,700
And do you know
what they dare call this hell?

1214
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,820
An asylum.

1215
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,180
A word that means "refuge".

1216
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:51,980
Are you scared?

1217
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,180
Of me? Why?

1218
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:06,580
Yes, I understand.

1219
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:09,900
You really thought I was crazy.

1220
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,100
And a crazy man who promised
to help you die.

1221
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,260
Why did you believe me?

1222
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:29,580
Why would I kill you?
You helped me. You were kind to me.

1223
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,700
If I killed you,

1224
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:36,220
I would be completely crazy.

1225
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,500
I'm not crazy.

1226
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:43,780
I never was.

1227
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:48,660
I told you,
my family had me locked up.

1228
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:52,180
They claimed that I was,
on the advice of the notary

1229
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,660
and the doctor.

1230
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,020
And the other one.

1231
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:02,020
It was silly of me to be scared.

1232
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,860
No, it's my fault.

1233
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:07,100
I talk, I talk,
I'm telling you bad things.

1234
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:11,460
Five years locked up alone,

1235
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,300
all those words you want to shout.

1236
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,100
That choke you, that hurt you. Yes.

1237
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:20,980
Of course, when you have someone
in front of you to talk to,

1238
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,700
all the words want
to come out at once.

1239
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,420
You understand.

1240
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:27,100
Yes, although it's
the opposite for me.

1241
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,140
It's kind of the same thing.

1242
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:32,780
You were locked up,
and I was forced to flee.

1243
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:36,340
I was forced to leave
from everywhere, all the time.

1244
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:39,380
So I didn't have anyone
to talk to either.

1245
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,500
And to think
I'm only talking about myself.

1246
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,820
You wanted to die...

1247
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,660
Sit down.

1248
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:47,980
Drink your coffee while it's hot.

1249
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:49,740
Yes.

1250
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,140
Can I take two?

1251
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,140
-Of course.
-Thank you.

1252
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,860
Heartbreak?

1253
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,700
-Want some cigarettes?
-Yes.

1254
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,100
There's one left.

1255
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,660
Thank you. You're kind.

1256
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:12,380
It's amazing.
I thought you were going to kill me.

1257
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,220
Yes.

1258
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,580
I was scared.

1259
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:19,020
-So I don't want to die anymore.
-It's wonderful.

1260
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,420
I don't even know why I did.

1261
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,740
It means you're crazy, like me.

1262
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,180
I just feel like

1263
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,500
everything's changed all of a sudden.

1264
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,620
I try to remember,
but all I can find is ghosts.

1265
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,860
This man...

1266
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:38,660
-What man?
-My father-in-law.

1267
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,060
I too have a nice family.

1268
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,980
My mother was a poor woman.

1269
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:48,420
She remarried a drunkard.

1270
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:51,260
I was 17, so he...

1271
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,300
Do you understand?

1272
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,700
He'd chase me around.

1273
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:57,260
It was untenable.

1274
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,100
So I was forced to leave.

1275
01:20:59,260 --> 01:21:01,500
-It's pathetic.
-Then,

1276
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,780
after him, all the others.

1277
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,860
And the head of the workshop,

1278
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,700
the cardboard factory where I worked.

1279
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,660
I had to leave, too.

1280
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:13,980
Then I worked in a hardware store.

1281
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:17,580
It was the boss, there.

1282
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:22,140
He was afraid of his wife,
so he'd take me to the basement.

1283
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,700
It's despicable.

1284
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:29,660
It's always the same thing
everywhere I go.

1285
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:33,500
I thought I'd see my father-in-law,
so I'd go away, and it'd start again.

1286
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,300
It's over now.

1287
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:41,020
The last one was a widower.
He was a stamp dealer.

1288
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,300
He seemed gentle, kind, delicate.

1289
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,780
He was inconsolable
over his wife's death.

1290
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,620
He was always looking at me

1291
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,700
with his pleading eyes,

1292
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,660
big eyes full of water.

1293
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:58,940
He ended up being
even more despicable than the others.

1294
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:03,380
It's over now.

1295
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,260
You'll forget all about it,
this whole nightmare.

1296
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,980
You'll see, you will live.

1297
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:14,380
There is more to life.

1298
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,020
Where are you? Where are you?

1299
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,500
I'm here.

1300
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,220
You must be tired.
You're falling asleep.

1301
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:36,580
-I think so.
-Get some rest.

1302
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,220
You're safe here.

1303
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,700
You cried?

1304
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,860
Don't. It's over now.

1305
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,340
Life is beautiful.

1306
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:52,060
You'll see. It's very beautiful.

1307
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:21,940
I'll take a head of lettuce,

1308
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:25,140
two kilos of potatoes
and two slices of ham.

1309
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,300
All right.

1310
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,260
Here. Someone gave me those.
They'll look better on you.

1311
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,580
Thank you.

1312
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,620
Where are you?

1313
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:47,380
Miss?

1314
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,540
Where are you?

1315
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,380
You're awake already?

1316
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:36,860
I was very careful.

1317
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,900
About what?

1318
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,580
To not make noise.

1319
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,500
It was the silence that woke me up.

1320
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,260
-The silence?
-Yes.

1321
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,220
You're hot?

1322
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,940
Yes, very hot.

1323
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:54,620
Was Bluebeard mean?

1324
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,540
Of course. He couldn't love
a woman without killing her.

1325
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:02,900
Maybe it's because they couldn't
love him without betraying him?

1326
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,780
He had his reasons
for not letting them touch the key.

1327
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,940
-The key?
-The key to the closet.

1328
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,100
Oh, yes.

1329
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,260
Do you know the language of flowers?

1330
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,260
-No.
-No?

1331
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:24,180
Do you know what the pansy means?

1332
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,140
It means "tenderness".

1333
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,580
I bought you cigarettes.

1334
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,700
Thank you.

1335
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,460
Don't worry. It's nothing!

1336
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:54,140
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing. The street.

1337
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:56,780
Two girls are playing hopscotch.

1338
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:00,740
It's odd. I always thought
that street was awfully sad,

1339
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,980
but now, it almost looks happy to me.

1340
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,460
Everything seems to have changed.

1341
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,460
Everything seems brighter
with you here.

1342
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,380
She told me that, too.

1343
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,020
I loved her.

1344
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:19,540
I was madly in love with her.

1345
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:22,500
Madly, yes, that's the right word.

1346
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:26,020
When I was taken to the asylum,

1347
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:29,140
she was sitting in the car next to me

1348
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:32,020
to make me think
we were going on vacation.

1349
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:38,380
She was their accomplice, for money.

1350
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,860
It's terrible.

1351
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:43,340
I'm begging you,

1352
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,460
don't think about her anymore.
Don't talk about her anymore.

1353
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,780
Yes.

1354
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:49,020
It was a nightmare. It's over.

1355
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:53,340
You'll see, everything will
become brighter for you, too.

1356
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,420
But...

1357
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,660
She was holding my hand,
just like you.

1358
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,220
She kept telling me

1359
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:10,860
she loved me.

1360
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:14,140
That's a word I've never said
to anyone before.

1361
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:17,060
And when you really love someone,
the difficult thing

1362
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,420
isn't to say it but to hide it.

1363
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,060
You have to see it
in the person's eyes.

1364
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,860
When they locked me in the room,

1365
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:30,580
she was in the doorway.

1366
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:33,100
Yes.

1367
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,900
She still dared to look at me.

1368
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:40,060
How could she look at you
without loving you?

1369
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,380
Such a pure forehead,

1370
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:47,100
such soft, bright eyes.

1371
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:52,940
My love, why did you take the key?

1372
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:57,100
You shouldn't have.
You shouldn't have.

1373
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,460
You shouldn't have.

1374
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:02,540
You shouldn't have!

1375
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:50,660
So much water has passed!
Let's move on.

1376
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:56,180
The famous violin of Ingres!

1377
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:59,020
The violin is often
an instrument of torture.

1378
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,260
So is the piano, actually.

1379
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,460
Raoul!

1380
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,980
Raoul!

1381
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:44,220
It's a song

1382
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:48,100
That resembles us

1383
01:31:48,260 --> 01:31:50,820
You loved me

1384
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,340
And I loved you

1385
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:57,660
We lived

1386
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:01,980
Together

1387
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,460
You loved me

1388
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:07,820
And I loved you

1389
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,620
But life separates

1390
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:15,100
Those who love each other

1391
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,100
Slowly

1392
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:22,100
Without making

1393
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:25,460
A noise

1394
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:29,140
And the sea erases

1395
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:32,140
From the sand

1396
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:36,300
The steps of the lovers

1397
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:41,180
Who are no more

1398
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:44,260
Here, while you're at it.

1399
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,980
Ah, it's so boring here

1400
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,420
It's so boring here

1401
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:20,180
Silence!

1402
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,060
What's wrong with you?
I thought you liked music.

1403
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,540
I was dreaming. I thought it had
happened, and then, suddenly...

1404
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:32,220
-What is this?
-Nothing. Buskers.

1405
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:34,300
Ticket and identity verification.

1406
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,500
They should've been out a long time
ago, but they were playing so well.

1407
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,740
Do you call that music?
I think it's noise.

1408
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:39,980
Like you know anything about it!

1409
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:43,260
A little, yes. When it comes
to rhythm, I'm unbeatable.

1410
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,860
No more clarinet, all right?

1411
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,900
-Guitar!
-Yeah.

1412
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:50,340
Get the hell out and don't come back!

1413
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,820
You understand French? I said out!

1414
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:54,980
Yes, gentleman!

1415
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,780
Gentleman? Watch your tone!

1416
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,620
-Don't come back!
-You hear that, Enrico?

1417
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:03,140
He thinks we broke in.

1418
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:06,540
Are you making fun of me? If I see
you again, you'll get eight days!

1419
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,580
OK. If we get hungry at Pentecost...

1420
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:10,460
Hungry?

1421
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,940
Get smart with me again, and...

1422
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,460
Scram!

1423
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,060
Gentlemen...

1424
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:20,660
Come on...

1425
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:25,540
-Coffee makes you angry.
-Coffee makes me sleepy.

1426
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:29,540
It even makes me dream.
Just now, without these two,

1427
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,860
I was having the dream of my life.

1428
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:44,180
-Anything else?
-One kilo of sugar, please.

1429
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,140
-Here.
-And one kilo of tomatoes.

1430
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,940
The kid sounds like
a saw with his violin!

1431
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,580
I live here. Can you imagine?

1432
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:59,900
I forgot! Give me
a pound of cherries, too.

1433
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,420
Who's making all that noise?

1434
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,420
My son. He's only ten years old!

1435
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,020
I can hear that.

1436
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:08,700
If I had a kid and a violin,

1437
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:12,740
I'd either take the violin apart
or put the kid in the fridge,

1438
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,740
but I'd never leave them together!

1439
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:18,100
Don't exaggerate!
The kid was born gifted.

1440
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:20,620
What do you want?
I respect his poor father's wishes.

1441
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,540
His poor father was second violin.

1442
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,540
-He wanted him...
-To be second violin?

1443
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:25,740
No, first.

1444
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:27,220
Disillusions of grandeur!

1445
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,300
It's the best way
to get him to behave.

1446
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,060
As long as he's playing,
I know what he's doing.

1447
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:40,140
Raoul, come here!

1448
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:44,260
Come on! Come on!

1449
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:47,140
Come on! Raoul, come on!

1450
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:49,500
Come on!

1451
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,660
Come on!

1452
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,660
For the kids, what a pain!

1453
01:36:20,820 --> 01:36:23,620
Tell me about it! When I see
Thursday coming, I can't sleep.

1454
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:25,420
The street belongs to them.

1455
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:28,300
If I were the government,
I would eliminate Thursday.

1456
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,020
Look at that. Will you stop that?

1457
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,380
Come try your luck!

1458
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:43,220
Little bastard!

1459
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,660
Little bastard! Come here!

1460
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:48,660
You'll pay for this!
I'll tell your mother!

1461
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,220
-What's going on?
-It wasn't me, sir!

1462
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:53,500
I had nothing to do with it!
I don't even have a slingshot!

1463
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,380
What? I saw you!
Did you see him, too?

1464
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,220
-I didn't.
-I'm telling you, it's him!

1465
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,780
I'm telling you it's not him, got it?

1466
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:01,420
Raoul! Raoul, come here.

1467
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:02,700
Come on, kid.

1468
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,380
Who will pay for the broken glass?

1469
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:07,460
You are. And pick up the pieces
if you don't want a ticket!

1470
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,980
Come on, buddy.

1471
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:11,500
And that how they spend our taxes...

1472
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,100
You're so kind.

1473
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:16,860
Go home and let me hear you play!

1474
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:19,460
You know, a woman alone
with a boy like that...

1475
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:22,420
When children don't make you mad,
it's because they're sick.

1476
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,780
And yours, thank God, is healthy.

1477
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:27,660
And to be fair,
he does give you satisfaction.

1478
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:32,180
He does... Listen.
How's that for satisfaction?

1479
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:36,220
That kid's an artist.
What he's playing is really pretty.

1480
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,580
-You think so?
-I do.

1481
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:40,380
Hearing him play
makes you want to cry.

1482
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:43,580
I'd shed a tear
if I wasn't in uniform.

1483
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:47,100
The violin always moves you.

1484
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:51,420
He's very lucky to have
a beautiful mother like his.

1485
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:53,380
You see the horn over there,

1486
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,180
-let's get it!
-Yeah, come on!

1487
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:56,700
Not here, over there!

1488
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:58,780
Yes, yes!

1489
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:08,740
I really think that.

1490
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:11,860
If he had the right support,
he would become someone.

1491
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:14,420
It's obvious when you listen to him.

1492
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:16,740
If all policemen were like you...

1493
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:19,060
Can you come for coffee tonight?

1494
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:20,660
-Really?
-Yes.

1495
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:22,380
But come in plain clothes because...

1496
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,700
You're not inviting the policeman
but the man.

1497
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,900
No, it's the friend.
With all due respect.

1498
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:29,780
-But the friend is also a man.
-We'll see about that.

1499
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,740
-That's great.
-What?

1500
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,540
Do you believe in dreams?

1501
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:52,060
He has it in his arm and his wrist.

1502
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,860
He has the wrist, the vibrato.

1503
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,820
This is called vibrato.
We have vibrato in our whistle.

1504
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:02,860
-So?
-So what?

1505
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,100
-Where is it?
-What?

1506
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,460
-The fire!
-What fire?

1507
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:08,020
You don't know where it is?

1508
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,820
How should I know?

1509
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:10,940
Who else should I ask?

1510
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:13,020
I don't know!
I'm not the fire alarm!

1511
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:15,460
-The horn was pushed!
-By whom?

1512
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:16,420
Unbelievable!

1513
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:19,340
It was right next to you,
but you didn't hear anything?

1514
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,900
I'll make a report.
You'll deal with your superiors!

1515
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:25,900
It's not my fault if there's no fire!

1516
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,580
So, Mr. Raoul,
will I see you tonight?

1517
01:39:28,780 --> 01:39:29,940
Yes.

1518
01:39:30,180 --> 01:39:32,060
-Around 8:30 p.m.?
-Right.

1519
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:34,260
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

1520
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,140
-Is that all?
-Yes, but I can do it again.

1521
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,180
-It's not another song?
-No, it's the same.

1522
01:39:56,420 --> 01:40:00,140
That's enough.
You can see what he can do.

1523
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:02,820
-Time for bed.
-A little longer!

1524
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:04,580
-I said in bed.
-Later!

1525
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:07,060
That's enough!

1526
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:08,860
I'll spank you!

1527
01:40:09,020 --> 01:40:10,900
You didn't hurt me.

1528
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,020
May I?

1529
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:16,060
Will you go to bed, or do you
want to take a trip to the station?

1530
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:19,580
All right, I'm going to bed.

1531
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:21,100
Because I want to.

1532
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,940
He's just as stubborn
as his father was.

1533
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:28,500
Don't get upset. Children are fickle.

1534
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:30,740
Thank you. But yours,

1535
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,540
musically speaking,
he sounds like a record.

1536
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,820
Raoul! Raoul, will you stop?

1537
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:41,300
-Why are you laughing?
-Because my name is Raoul, too.

1538
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:42,780
No?

1539
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,820
Sometimes,
when you call him on the street,

1540
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:47,140
I turn around randomly.
You never know.

1541
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,060
I wouldn't dare.

1542
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:51,460
What would your wife think?

1543
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:53,820
I haven't had a wife since July 14.

1544
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,780
She left me for a colleague.
I don't see the difference.

1545
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,060
And yet, in terms of tenderness,
I've always been...

1546
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,380
affectionate and not at all jealous.

1547
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:05,860
I sweep the floor, I do the laundry,

1548
01:41:06,020 --> 01:41:09,060
I carry breakfast to bed.
I'm just naturally happy.

1549
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,500
And then, physically...

1550
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:13,900
I see another one.

1551
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:16,980
So you're a widow, too?

1552
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:18,580
Yes.

1553
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:21,500
Now with my kid and my business,

1554
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:24,260
there are times when I feel quite
alone, without anyone.

1555
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:26,300
If I can help in any way...

1556
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,260
I'm mostly worried about my son.

1557
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:31,540
After what you told me
about his violin,

1558
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:34,380
-it's a shame he lost his teacher.
-Is he dead?

1559
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:37,580
No, he didn't come back.
I hesitate to take another one.

1560
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:39,780
I'm telling you, he's a champ.

1561
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:42,860
Yes, but you could be wrong.
You're not in the business.

1562
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:46,220
Before I pay for it, I'd like to have
the opinion of an artist.

1563
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:48,260
It'd be very helpful if you knew one.

1564
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:51,220
Well, you can't just find an artist

1565
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:52,700
everywhere.

1566
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:56,820
Companions of bad days

1567
01:41:56,980 --> 01:42:00,820
I wish you a good night

1568
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:04,060
Sleep, dream

1569
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,860
I'll take my hat

1570
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:11,220
And two or three cigarettes
From my pack

1571
01:42:11,420 --> 01:42:14,380
And I'm leaving

1572
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:17,380
Companions of bad days

1573
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:21,140
Think of me sometime

1574
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:24,620
Later when you're awake

1575
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:27,740
Think of the one who sings smiling

1576
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:29,580
An air of desolation

1577
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:33,660
Somewhere in the night

1578
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:37,380
By the sea

1579
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:41,380
And who then begs

1580
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:46,140
To buy food and water

1581
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:50,820
Companions of bad days

1582
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:55,900
I wish you a good night

1583
01:42:56,060 --> 01:43:00,140
Sleep, dream

1584
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:04,460
I'm leaving

1585
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:07,100
Take your equipment and follow me!

1586
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:09,660
-Don't be mean!
-Don't make it worse!

1587
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:11,500
Don't exaggerate!

1588
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:13,060
Why would I get in trouble for this?

1589
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,900
There are better excuses.

1590
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,700
I'll make my report, you'll see.

1591
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:17,300
He's so nervous!

1592
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:19,380
Nervous? Watch your mouth.

1593
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:20,580
Insulting an officer,
that's six months.

1594
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:22,260
I didn't insult you.
I said you were nervous.

1595
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,500
All right! All right!

1596
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:27,540
Let us go. You can't be serious!

1597
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:29,900
Who's in charge here?
I'll decide if you can go.

1598
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,140
I'm willing to let it go
but on one condition.

1599
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,020
Go ahead.

1600
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:35,180
No reason why we can't
get along like good people.

1601
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,420
-Yeah.
-So here it is:

1602
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:40,420
I know a kid who plays the violin.

1603
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,300
Well, playing is a big word.
He sounds like he's sawing iron.

1604
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,500
It sends shivers down your spine.

1605
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,580
What do you want us to do?
Steal his violin?

1606
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:51,900
On the contrary. I want you
to listen to him as an expert,

1607
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:54,220
compliment him
in front of his mother,

1608
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,580
tell him he has a bright future.

1609
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:59,300
-Not much.
-That's all?

1610
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,060
-Yes.
-I don't get it.

1611
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:03,820
You have to leave
an unfortunate widow her illusions.

1612
01:44:04,060 --> 01:44:07,140
That child is all she has.
It's her only consolation.

1613
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:09,500
I'm giving you the opportunity
to do a good deed.

1614
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:13,060
-How's the mother?
-She's a grocer.

1615
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:15,260
I'm not asking you what she does
but how she is.

1616
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,900
That's none of your business,
but you'll see her.

1617
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:20,540
I'll introduce you as an old friend,
married, of course.

1618
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:21,580
Why married?

1619
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:26,220
It'd validate your opinion
more than if you were single.

1620
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:27,620
Agreed?

1621
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,820
I have a choice between two violins.

1622
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:32,860
I'll choose the lesser.

1623
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,100
What are you doing on Sunday?

1624
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:54,940
Nice bouquet!

1625
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:57,580
I don't know if the child
will be happy,

1626
01:44:57,780 --> 01:44:59,660
but the mother will be thrilled.

1627
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,900
You and your insinuations!
Go have a drink!

1628
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:04,060
-On your dime?
-Yes. Even two, if you prefer.

1629
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:07,860
Let's have a drink, let's have two
Let's drink to a lover

1630
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:08,900
Leave me be.

1631
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,860
A music lover, of course!

1632
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:12,580
Still, leave me be!

1633
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:16,980
What a way for a peacekeeper
to express himself,

1634
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,700
even in civilian clothes.

1635
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,220
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Raoul.

1636
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:25,060
Cute kid!

1637
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,780
That's for you, and that's for you.

1638
01:45:27,940 --> 01:45:29,500
You're spoiling us, Mr. Raoul.

1639
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,100
I'm interested in the boy wonder.

1640
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:33,660
Raoul, say thank you to Mr. Raoul,
come on!

1641
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:34,580
Thank you.

1642
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:37,220
May I? Excuse me.

1643
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:39,220
I have another surprise for you.

1644
01:45:39,940 --> 01:45:41,620
Another one?

1645
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:45,180
I just met an old friend of mine.

1646
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:48,580
An artist of great value.
He's in Paris.

1647
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:50,260
I told him about the boy,

1648
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:53,740
and what I told him interested
him so much, that he asked

1649
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:55,740
-if he could hear him.
-Is he coming here?

1650
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:57,420
Yes, in a minute.
Do your best.

1651
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,540
Go wash your hands.

1652
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:01,060
My friend always speaks his mind.

1653
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:03,980
He never gets carried away.
He'll listen to the boy,

1654
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:06,620
will think about it,

1655
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:08,660
and he'll let you know
what he thinks,

1656
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:10,820
whether you like it or not.

1657
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:14,620
Sorry to bother you,
but someone is asking for you.

1658
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:17,180
-Good.
-That's the friend I told you about!

1659
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:20,380
-Hello, my friend!
-Hi.

1660
01:46:21,860 --> 01:46:22,900
Nice hat.

1661
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:24,900
-Cheap.
-Even better.

1662
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:27,660
I'll show you the boy. After you.

1663
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:31,220
Don't bother us.
We're having a meeting.

1664
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:35,100
Three adults and a kid.

1665
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:38,380
Ma'am. Pleased to meet you.

1666
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:41,220
-The honor is mine.
-Thank you.

1667
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,220
Sit down.

1668
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:46,460
-A cup of coffee?
-Yes, please.

1669
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,940
This is the phenomenon!
He's a little shy.

1670
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:50,860
Hi, buddy, how are you?

1671
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:53,660
-Not bad, you?
-Be polite, will you?

1672
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:56,100
So, you're the artist?

1673
01:46:56,260 --> 01:46:58,180
-Let's see it.
-Go!

1674
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:01,260
Don't hurry!

1675
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:04,060
We have plenty of time.

1676
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:07,940
Exactly. We have plenty of time.

1677
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,580
-Lucky me.
-Go ahead, buddy.

1678
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:55,100
That's it.

1679
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:14,660
Good wrist, huh?

1680
01:48:19,420 --> 01:48:21,620
Do you play like this on purpose?

1681
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,420
-Or is it involuntary?
-No,

1682
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,060
it's instinct!
He plays like he breathes.

1683
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:26,340
Let him answer!

1684
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:28,820
I do it on purpose.

1685
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:30,180
Yeah.

1686
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:35,380
-So?
-So?

1687
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:46,060
This kid has no talent.

1688
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,260
None.

1689
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:52,500
Well, at least now we know.

1690
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:54,780
He has more than talent.

1691
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:58,180
I've never heard it played
that way before! Never!

1692
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:00,580
In his own way,
he's some kind of genius.

1693
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:04,140
A new Paganini.

1694
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:07,300
When he was a kid.

1695
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:09,980
-That's it.
-Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

1696
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:13,100
Thanks to you, I've experienced
something unforgettable.

1697
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:16,620
I don't regret coming.

1698
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:20,820
You can go play, go.
You've earned it.

1699
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:23,380
We must drink to such success!

1700
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:26,100
-What will you do with him?
-He needs to practice!

1701
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,900
Yes, but with whom?

1702
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:29,500
Too bad you can't stay in Paris.

1703
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:33,220
It's a man like you that
he would need.

1704
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:34,420
You flatter me.

1705
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:37,180
With you, one feels immediately safe.

1706
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:39,700
It's true. You're nice and kind.

1707
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,780
And you have kind eyes.

1708
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:46,220
No matter what we say,
an artist is not the same as others.

1709
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,780
If you wanted
to take care of the boy...

1710
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:51,940
Unfortunately, that's not possible.
He has to leave tomorrow morning.

1711
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:53,980
Not at all!
I'm not leaving.

1712
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:55,660
Didn't I tell you?
I've cancelled all my contracts.

1713
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:58,020
-You're kidding, right?
-No, not at all.

1714
01:49:58,460 --> 01:50:00,420
He can't anyway, but he'd love

1715
01:50:00,620 --> 01:50:02,860
to refer you
to a good teacher, right?

1716
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:05,500
I'll do better than that,
out of friendship for you.

1717
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:08,660
I will, if you will permit me,
take care of this child myself.

1718
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:11,180
Yes, yes, I insist!

1719
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:12,660
I'm confused.

1720
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,620
I don't know how to thank you.

1721
01:50:14,860 --> 01:50:15,940
Please.

1722
01:50:16,260 --> 01:50:19,740
I'm being paid by making
an old friend happy!

1723
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:22,860
I'll be back in a few days,
and we can have a useful chat.

1724
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:24,340
-Goodbye, dear.
-Bye.

1725
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,860
Are you coming or staying?

1726
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:27,620
-I'll go with you.
-Mr. Raoul,

1727
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:29,780
I'll never forget your help,

1728
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:32,140
introducing me to your friend.

1729
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:34,220
-Thanks again.
-You're very welcome.

1730
01:50:39,860 --> 01:50:41,780
Are you happy now?
You've been playing me!

1731
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:42,700
-Me?
-Yes, you!

1732
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,180
That's not nice.

1733
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,860
-After all I've done for you.
-There's a bastard I'd like to beat!

1734
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,500
Where? He'll have to deal with me!

1735
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:53,460
You can't in civilian clothes.
He might teach you a lesson.

1736
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,580
Be careful,
or go put your uniform on.

1737
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,660
But you were right about the boy.

1738
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:01,420
He sounds horrible.

1739
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:04,380
He showed great promise
but for the guitar.

1740
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:06,580
-Trust me, I...
-Trust you?

1741
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:10,700
I'll never tell the mother
what you said about the boy.

1742
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:13,540
We wouldn't want
to hurt her feelings.

1743
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,980
She's lovely.

1744
01:51:15,140 --> 01:51:16,660
I'm going to get into my uniform.

1745
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,300
That's right!

1746
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:22,020
So, after what happened
between us today, let's be informal!

1747
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:26,100
Who needs a ticket?
Come get your tickets!

1748
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:30,100
Come try your luck,
ladies and gentlemen!

1749
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:36,020
Who needs a ticket?
Come get your tickets!

1750
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:38,740
Every ticket wins!
Drawing next Wednesday.

1751
01:51:41,380 --> 01:51:45,300
Who needs a ticket?
Come get your tickets!

1752
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,700
Drawing next Wednesday.

1753
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:55,140
Who needs a ticket?
Come get your tickets!

1754
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:59,860
Come try your luck!

1755
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:02,540
Who needs a ticket?
Every ticket wins!

1756
01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:05,580
It's weird to be closed
on a Thursday.

1757
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:07,380
All three of them
went to the countryside.

1758
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:08,500
-Three?
-Yes,

1759
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:10,780
Mrs. Solange,
the boy and your friend,

1760
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:13,740
-the handsome guy.
-You think he's handsome?

1761
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:16,620
-Yes, not bad.
-Well, they're not here.

1762
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:18,140
But they're not far!

1763
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,580
It's the kid's day.
It's Saint Raoul's day!

1764
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,380
Saint Raoul's day?

1765
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:24,620
Give me a ticket, at random.

1766
01:52:24,780 --> 01:52:26,460
You look like someone in luck

1767
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:28,500
tonight.

1768
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,820
Here.

1769
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:35,340
Who needs a ticket?
Come get your tickets!

1770
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:37,380
Come try your luck!

1771
01:52:39,100 --> 01:52:40,900
Every ticket wins!

1772
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:27,580
Every day of the week

1773
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:31,100
In winter, in the fall

1774
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:37,340
In the sky of Paris
Factory chimneys only smoke gray

1775
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:40,740
But the coming spring

1776
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:44,460
A flower on his ear

1777
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:49,460
A pretty girl on his arm

1778
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:53,660
Sunflower, Sunflower

1779
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:56,740
It's the name of the flower

1780
01:53:56,940 --> 01:54:02,420
The name of the girl
She has no last name

1781
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:07,260
She dances on street corners
In Belleville, in Seville

1782
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:11,380
Sunflower, Sunflower, Sunflower

1783
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:14,340
Waltz of the street corners

1784
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:16,820
And the good times came

1785
01:54:17,020 --> 01:54:18,260
The good life

1786
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,180
With them

1787
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:23,660
The genius of the Bastille
Smoking a blue Gitane

1788
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,340
In the sky of love

1789
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:29,380
In the sky of Seville

1790
01:54:29,540 --> 01:54:33,620
In the sky of my city

1791
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:38,820
And even from anywhere

1792
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:44,580
Sunflower, Sunflower

1793
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:47,620
It's the name of the flower

1794
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:53,140
The name of the girl
She has no last name

1795
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:55,540
She dances on street corners

1796
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:58,380
In Belleville, in Seville

1797
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:02,740
Sunflower, Sunflower, Sunflower

1798
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:06,140
Waltz of the street corners

1799
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:09,660
Well sung, kids!

1800
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:12,100
Ready for your first lesson?

1801
01:55:12,940 --> 01:55:15,580
-What are you waiting for?
-Go ahead, Raoul, go ahead!

1802
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:17,460
Raoul is going to play!

1803
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,580
Sit here.

1804
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:22,100
Listen to him.

1805
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:26,780
See, it's not very difficult. And
it's less dangerous than a violin.

1806
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:28,780
Yes, but it's less
annoying for everyone.

1807
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:38,020
What's your first name?

1808
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:41,180
Solange.
Funny you should ask.

1809
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:43,660
-Why?
-Just saying.

1810
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:47,700
Not long ago, I met someone who
often told me what his name was.

1811
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:49,980
He never asked for my name.

1812
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:53,420
-Wasn't he curious?
-Not like you.

1813
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:58,140
-Are you curious?
-I am.

1814
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:11,980
-What's your name?
-Raoul.

1815
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:15,780
-Like my little boy.
-Yes, that's good.

1816
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:20,220
Today is his day.
And it's mine too.

1817
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,420
Yes.

1818
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:29,500
I know someone who'd love to be here.

1819
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:31,860
-Who?
-Your friend.

1820
01:56:32,900 --> 01:56:36,220
Oh yes! I had completely
forgotten about that one!

1821
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:39,460
It's not good to forget your friends.

1822
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:46,820
Who needs a ticket?
Come get your tickets!

1823
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,980
Come get your tickets!

1824
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:58,100
Listen, Mr. Raoul,
it's your day too,

1825
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:01,220
so I thought of you,
because I like you.

1826
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,140
After what you did for my son and I,

1827
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:05,860
it's thanks to you that
he's learning the guitar

1828
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:08,020
and that I've met your friend.

1829
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:10,380
You've been a godsend for us.

1830
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:15,060
So I thought you might want
to keep this violin.

1831
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:16,980
To remember the three of us!

1832
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:19,900
Who needs a ticket?

1833
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:23,980
Come try your luck, ma'am!
Drawing is next Wednesday!

1834
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,580
Come get your tickets!

1835
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:30,620
Who needs a ticket?

1836
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:34,980
Mr. Raoul!

1837
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:39,140
Mr. Raoul! My mom said
she forgot to give you this.

1838
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:46,340
Come try your luck!
Every ticket wins!

1839
01:57:57,260 --> 01:58:00,180
Here. It's for the lost and found.

1840
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:05,540
That's it.

1841
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:09,260
You see how intrusive
an object can be.

1842
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:11,180
Sometimes, it tells the whole story.

1843
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:14,380
And if you don't want us to know
anything about your personal life,

1844
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,460
take care of your things.

1845
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:28,340
THE END

1846
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:30,420
Subtitling: Hiventy
