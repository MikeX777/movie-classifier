1
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:41,440
They're the new owners of the villa.

2
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:45,082
- She's Rassimov's heir.
- Professor Rassimov?

3
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,841
Alex...

4
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,596
- ...look, we're here!
- Finally.

5
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:09,520
I couldn't stand it anymore.

6
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:22,796
Igor!

7
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,677
Our masters are here!

8
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:38,722
- No one is here.
- It's better than what I had hoped for.

9
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:42,123
- Yes.... sure.
- There's Boris.

10
00:02:43,527 --> 00:02:47,566
- Welcome home. Miss Anne, Sir....
- Thank you.

11
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:54,797
This room belonged to my father.

12
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:02,205
You'll like it as soon as it is cleaned up.

13
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:12,319
My room is in the other wing of the house.

14
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:56,959
It's so beautiful!

15
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,198
Isn't it wonderful, Alex?

16
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:06,684
A lot of time must have gone by since
someone has come into this room.

17
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:12,120
- I'm so happy! I feel like a child again!
- I noticed.

18
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,798
Come!

19
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:19,963
Please.

20
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,087
Alex, look how beautiful.

21
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,921
Boris, we must tidy up everything.

22
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:44,003
- Unfortunately everything's been abandoned.
It's been years since someone came in here. - Be careful.

23
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:49,803
One could brake a leg here. Was it absolutely necessary?

24
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:55,877
- Please, just one moment.
- Yes my dear... as you wish.

25
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,165
This is my father's grave.

26
00:04:59,207 --> 00:05:04,839
This is the only room in the castle which I kept up
in respect to the professor's memory.

27
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,447
We still mourn his loss.

28
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:28,999
There's a lot of work to be done to fix everything.

29
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:31,436
- Are you sure about what you want?
- Yes.

30
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:36,515
It's a big house, Alex, but I was happy here.
We'll like it here. You'll see.

31
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:41,402
- I like your determination.
- But we'll both have to work at happiness.

32
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:52,796
A perfect job.

33
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,004
- You can put those books over there.
- Yes, Yes.

34
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:12,164
This is the silk you ordered.

35
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,643
Alex...

36
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:21,243
- What do you think of this color?
- Great choice.

37
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:25,246
- Fine, we'll take this one.
- Thank you.

38
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:40,084
- We must think about the garden, Boris.
- I already took care of it.

39
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,005
Here's Doctor Walensky, our neighbour.

40
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,397
- Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Nejinsky.
- Thank you.

41
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:10,884
- I'm glad to see you're among us again.
- I'm happy too.

42
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:13,725
- Do you plan to settle for good in this house?
- I think so. - Very well.

43
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,806
Before your arrival this house seemed like a menace,

44
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:20,884
but now that you're here it will be like the end of a bad dream.

45
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:25,478
- Thank you.
- I'll come back to see you.

46
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:48,440
- It was a surprise to know of your
intentions to re-open the house. - An occasion to rest.

47
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:53,607
- That is a good idea. Nothing ever happens here.
- Of course, Inspector.

48
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:57,481
- We're not in a big city.
- The only one who has something to here is the Doctor.

49
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:01,202
Fortunately not too much, they're all ancient here.

50
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,359
So yours is like a mission.

51
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:10,800
I have some properties that allow me
to dedicate myself to my mission as you say.

52
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:14,726
My husband is a doctor too though he quit a few years ago.

53
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:18,159
I don't appreciate you treating my guests that way.

54
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,722
I see the lady already feels like a countess.

55
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,440
Seeing that I cannot feel like a wife.

56
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:32,439
- I'm sorry, dear. You see, we're unhappy again.
- It doesn't matter, dear, it was my fault.

57
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:38,926
Listen, if we keep acting like this  we'll never save our marriage.

58
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:42,562
I don't want it to fail. We must help each other.

59
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:50,601
- I'd like to be sure of it.
- How could you doubt it?

60
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:55,646
I'll try to make you forgive my moments of jealousy.

61
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:05,284
(''I, Professor Kowalsky, Medical Doctor,...")

62
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:09,002

63
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,437

64
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:15,445

65

66
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,285
(''Courage is sometimes desperation.'')

67
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:17,162
Your garden has been enriched with the most beautiful flower.

68
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,040
They're so beautiful it would be a pity to pick them.

69
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:24,683
It would be a greater pity to let them wither.

70
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:30,647
Why have you moved to this small village?
You'd be successful in the city.

71
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:35,158
- Maybe I'm looking for something also.
- Also?

72
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,597
Well, we're all looking for something.

73
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:42,917
- Have you found what you are looking for?
- Maybe I have.

74
00:16:57,047 --> 00:17:02,041
We don't have many distractions but it's so peaceful here.

75
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:11,596
I'd like to help you Anne both as a doctor and as a friend.

76
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:18,166
- I can't see you so unhappy.  - You shouldn't think that I'm
unhappy and need a doctor. I don't need anything.

77
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:22,644
Forgive me, Anne, but I'd be happy to do something for you.

78
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,804
Then be a sincere friend. It would be enough.

79
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:29,283
- Will you allow me to come visit you?
- We'd be glad.

80
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:51,801
(''The task I wanted to accomplish through the
construction of the machine,...'')

81
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:55,396

(''..of the blood that sustained the bodies of
the subjects spoiled by me.'')

88
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,886
Good morning.

89
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:43,884
- Your breakfast Miss.
- "Mrs", Boris.  - Excuse me... the habit...

90
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:50,397
Thank you. Have you seen my husband?

91
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:56,238
- He might be in the library. He spends most of nights there.
- Yes I know.

92
00:18:56,287 --> 00:19:02,203
- I'm worried about his health.
- He hasn't slept in his bed for several nights now.

93
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:15,644
There you go, Madam. The biscuits just come out of the oven.
We'll made the for you.

94
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,357
Thank you.

95
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:05,637
(''The necessary tension must be
between 7,000 and 10,000 Volts.'')

96

the experiment would be compromised.'')

the necessary potency.'')

104
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:02,957
I can assure you it's like this, Anne. I'm very worried.

105
00:21:03,007 --> 00:21:05,840
You have no reason to worry, Igor.

106
00:21:09,007 --> 00:21:14,127
Things that are seen from the outside sometimes
appear worse than they really are.

107
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:18,126
- Don't refuse my help, Anne.
- You can't help me.

108
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:23,799
Oh, our doctor is here.
Is it a professional visit or a friendly one?

109
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,361
Both.

110
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:31,320
- Please.
- Thank you.

111
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:36,356
Is one of our servants sick?

112
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:40,400
Actually it's not your servants.

113
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:45,805
- Then who is the patient?
- You two.

114
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,724
Don't exaggerate, Igor.

115
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:53,360
Except that the doctor can't do much even if his
diagnosis is correct.

116
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:58,527
- We must recognize a remarkable acuteness in our friend.
- Please, Alex.

117
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,843
Why hide the evidence?

118
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:05,725
My dear, also our coming here was a consequence.

119
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:13,720
I just wanted one thing: a little peace to find ourselves.
But this wasn't possible.

120
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:18,124
I can assure you, despite my will as a doctor and
as a husband.

121
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:23,195
- From the way you're talking about it, it seems
like a desperate case. - Anyway, my case.

122
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:26,882
Don't you agree?

123
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:31,398
I was just worried that the sickness doesn't provoke
incurable wounds for both of you.

124
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:34,678
- This won't happen.
- Right.

125
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:39,278
I'll say good-bye then. Madam, Doctor...

126
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:45,802
- Alex...
- Please, Anne, you must excuse me.

127
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:51,638
I can't stand intrusions in our intimacy.

128
00:22:53,687 --> 00:22:57,646
I might be exaggerating but...

129
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:02,564
..but I think it only concerns us.

130
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,242
Don't you agree?

131
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:11,364
Also, there's something else,...

132
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:16,959
..I'm sure I'm over my crisis and can prove it to you.

133
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:23,441
Sasha! Where are you?

134
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:31,676
- Have you seen the dog?
- I haven't heard him in a while. He must be out in the park.

135
00:23:31,727 --> 00:23:34,525
I'm worried about him.

136
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,319
Sashiska!

137
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,517
Sasha, where are you?

138
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:41,198
Come here!

139
00:23:42,207 --> 00:23:44,402
Come, Sasha!

140
00:23:44,447 --> 00:23:46,517
Come on, dear, come on!

141
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,686
Sasha!

142
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,405
Sasha!

143
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,599
Sasha!

144
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,361
Alex! Come here! Quick!

145
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,365
- What's going on?
- It's terrible, Alex.

146
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:40,201
He's dead?

147
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:48,361
- Be strong... It is dead.
- Oh, no!

148
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:50,637
He was poisoned.

149
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:07,277
Kills the good and frees the evil.
Kills the good and frees the evil.

150
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:53,157
Mommy! Mommy! Come play with me! Please!

151
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:56,279
I have things to do now. Be a good boy.

152
00:27:57,367 --> 00:28:01,997
''Be a good boy. I'm busy. Be a good boy.'' Uff!

153
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:12,558
Daddy! Daddy! I have to tell you something!

154
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,599
- Hi!
- Hi woman! I'm hungry!

155
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:22,079
- What do you want?
- Come with me. There's a strange thing over there.

156
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:26,484
- What?
- Why do ants go all in one row? Look!

157
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:31,999
Good question. Do you see that hole?
It's the entrance to their home.

158
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:40,118
They come out of there to look for food
and then bring it back home.

159
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,806
Why don't they eat it right away?

160
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:47,841
Don't we put food away for the winter?
They're just like us.

161
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:51,562
Ants have their problems too and they obey to their own laws.

162
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:57,443
- Don't they ever get mad?
- Why should they? Humans work too and they dont' get mad.

163
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:06,086
- Go home immediately! - Daddy!
- Don't argue! Go home now!

164
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:08,766
- Go away!
- Daddy!

165
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:12,004
What do you want? Go away!!

166
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:19,440
Daddy!

167
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:23,075
Daddy! Monster!

168
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,522
Stop for a moment.

169
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:51,604
- The police station.
- At the end of the road, Madam.

170
00:29:57,887 --> 00:30:02,324
- Have you found anything, Inspector?
- It's not easy to find traces of a vagabond.

171
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:08,037
- A vagabond?
- Who else could have killed the dog? Evidently just a stranger.

172
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:11,636
- You must find him.
- We'll find him, don't worry.

173
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,839
They killed them all... They killed them all... Cowards!

174
00:30:26,567 --> 00:30:29,684
An innocent soul! An innocent soul!

175
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:32,366
It's better if you go home, Madam.

176
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:13,316
What should I do, Madam?
Do you want to keep waiting?

177
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:19,402
- Did my husband say where he was going?
- We haven't seen him all day.

178
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:23,720
- You can go ahead, Boris.
- Yes, Madam.

179
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:29,724
Forgive me, dear... An interesting book made me forget
about time and I...

180
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:32,884
I don't know what to say.

181
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:39,446
It's a shame about the meal.
The meat must have lost most of its flavour.

182
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:42,524
Why don't you sit down?
You should eat something.

183
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:47,721
- Please.
- No, thank you. I feel tired. I'd like to rest for a while.

184
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:53,317
- Do you mind if I go to bed earlier?
- As you wish.

185
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:56,757
- Do you need anything?
- No, thank you.

186
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:53,561
- Looking for a man in the woods...
- Is like looking for a needle in a haystack. - It's true!

187
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:38,796
Oh Yes!

188
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:43,204
- Yes, kiss me. - Yes, dear.
- Kiss me again. - Yes, dear.

189
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,517
I love you. I love you.

190
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,922
What do you want?

191
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,366
What are you looking for?

192
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,962
No!

193
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,963
No!

194
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:22,283
No! No!

195
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:28,126
- Hey! The dogs found something!
- Quick!

196
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,556
- To this side!
- Don't let him go!

197
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:34,600
- It's the killer!
- Ssh...

198
00:36:34,647 --> 00:36:38,162
- Over here! Quick!

199
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:41,119
Look for him, Ivan! Look!

200
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:44,876
It's there, quick! All come here! All come here!

201
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:10,717
No-one's here.

202
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:16,197
It's just my size.

203
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,637
- Over here! Quick!
- This way!

204
00:37:20,687 --> 00:37:24,157
- Don't let him escape!
- Come on, you, run! - Hurry up!

205
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:52,362
- He killed another two!
- Murderer! - This way!

206
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:54,796
- Hurry up!
- He must not escape!

207
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:59,644
- He can't have gone far!
- Let's go! - Come on!

208
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:03,043
- Follow us!
- This way!

209
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:06,917
Hurry up!

210
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:15,639
- There he is!
- Come on! - Over there!

211
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:19,720
- There he is!
- Let's run! Hurry up!

212
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:22,365
- There he is!
- Ehi?!

213
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:28,245
- C'mon, let's go!
- Get him! - It's him!

214
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:31,996
- What did I do? Ehi! - Hurry up!
- Calm down! - He's escaping!

215
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:44,364
- You go over there and you come with me!
- Yes!

216
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,157
- Over there!

217
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,045
- It's here!

218
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:43,355
- Get him!  - There he is!

219
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:59,167
What do you want from me?

220
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,758
Ehi, stop!

221
00:40:05,927 --> 00:40:07,406
Stop!

222
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:11,164
Let him go!

223
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:14,119
Let him go! You kill him!

224
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,766
I'm innocent!

225
00:40:16,807 --> 00:40:18,445
Let him go.

226
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:21,320
- Have you all gone crazy?
- It's a monster! Leave him to us!

227
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:24,279
You killed him! Beasts!

228
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:29,083
I hope we found the right man or it would be
a terrible mistake.

229
00:41:29,127 --> 00:41:32,802
- Right! Good morning doctor.
- Good morning judge.

230
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:38,877
- Inspector, I examined the man that was killed.
- What can you tell us? Could he have been the killer?

231
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:45,036
For what I could see he was capable of committing
the crimes he was killed for.

232
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:49,603
For his mental conditions it's too late to examine them.

233
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:54,801
- But it could have been him.
- There are no elements to establish that.

234
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:58,396
In any case, no-one in town could have done something similar.

235
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:01,644
My men checked every single home, every individual suspect.

236
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:05,680
- I think I can consider the case closed.
- Me too.

237
00:42:06,687 --> 00:42:09,645
I don't think we should keep worrying.

238
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:15,205
I agree but I feel it's too much of a simple solution.

239
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:20,241
Infact, not too have any unpleasant surprises,
we decided to continue our surveillance.

240
00:42:29,487 --> 00:42:32,126
Come in.

241
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:49,246
- You don't like me, right?
- Liking or not liking someone is a luxury I can't afford to have.

242
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:00,562
Did you hurt yourself?

243
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:05,002
- Do you need anything, sir?
- No...

244
00:43:05,047 --> 00:43:07,845
- Perhaps the doctor...
- Get out of here.

245
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:12,880
- Go away!
- Yes sir... Yes sir, sure.

246
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,398
Come in.

247
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,238
Are you going out?

248
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:38,756
I'm going to the village. Shopping... Visit some friends.

249
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:49,401
Are you going to see your doctor?

250
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:53,487
Don't be foolish.

251
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:59,244
- What did you do to your hand?
- Nothing.

252
00:44:00,727 --> 00:44:03,082
Are you worried about me now?

253
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:06,680
Your jealousy makes you hateful.

254
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,637
Do you need anything?

255
00:44:16,127 --> 00:44:18,322
No, thanks.

256
00:44:22,767 --> 00:44:28,876
(Vedi il tuo dottore. Vedi il tuo Dottore. Vedi il tuo Dottore.)

257
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:36,896
(Your jealousy make you hateful. Hateful. Hateful.)

258
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:02,805
- I didn't hear you knock.
- I didn't.

259
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,557
But we had agreed on it.

260
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,242
What's wrong?

261
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,399
I'm losing myself...

262
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:28,324
..and you.

263
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:32,684
We lost each other a long time ago.

264
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:43,316
How did we get to this point?
Why did we lose each other?

265
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:46,677
Ann, I love you.

266
00:45:53,647 --> 00:45:55,717
I believe you, Alex.

267
00:45:55,767 --> 00:45:59,806
Then why can't we go back to how we were?

268
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:04,926
Because one can't forget.

269
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:08,437
You must give me time to cure my wounds.

270
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:13,996
To find each other again.

271
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:16,766
Your absurd jealousy offended me.

272
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:32,239
- You condemn me like this.
- You wanted it.

273
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:40,798
- It's late.
- I'm sorry.

274
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:07,399
- Come on, don't make me wait.
- Don't be impatient.

275
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:10,325
Undress yourself.

276
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:33,364
- Come here.
- No.

277
00:49:35,007 --> 00:49:37,646
- Don't you like it?
- You're a little witch.

278
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:16,802
- I can't resist you! Come here, I want you!
- You're so impatient! Be nice!

279
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,680
Let me do as I wish.

280
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:34,876
Ehi, what's wrong with you? Go away!

281
00:51:29,727 --> 00:51:31,877
(Anne!)

282
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,758
(Anne!)

283
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:36,605
(Aniuska!)

284
00:51:36,647 --> 00:51:39,445
(Aniuska!)

285
00:51:39,487 --> 00:51:41,921
(She doesn't love you anymore.)

286
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:46,518
- Can you doubt it?
- (No, no, no. I love you.)

287
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:53,647
(I love you Ann. I love you so much.)

288
00:51:55,687 --> 00:51:57,917
- I love you.
- I love you too, Igor.

289
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:01,846
(No, no. It's not true!)

290
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:05,721
You condemn me like this.
You condemn me.

291
00:52:05,767 --> 00:52:09,555
- You condemn yourself.
- (No, no. I was not me.)

292
00:52:09,607 --> 00:52:13,316
- Only a mad man could have done it.
- (No. I'm not crazy.)

293
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:17,155
- Sometimes you scare me.
- (No.)

294
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:19,437
(Don't say it! Don't say it!)

295
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:23,203
(The book.)

296
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:24,317
Monster!

297
00:52:28,087 --> 00:52:31,204
- (The book...)
- What do you want?

298
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:37,364
(No! Not me!)

299
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:38,601
Daddy!

300
00:52:45,607 --> 00:52:48,724
(No, no!)

301
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:52,282
(I don't want to! I don't want to! I dont' want to!)

302
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:42,683
Professor! What's wrong?

303
00:53:42,727 --> 00:53:48,165
You're the killer?!
You won't kill her! I won't allow it!

304
00:54:31,567 --> 00:54:34,684
Speak! Speak, damn you! Speak!

305
00:54:35,887 --> 00:54:39,004
It's your fault! It's your fault!

306
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:43,445
I didn't want to... I didn't want to.

307
00:54:44,807 --> 00:54:47,037
Why? why?

308
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:54,486
If you kill good you free evil.

309
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:57,564
This time we can't let him escape! Let's go!

310
00:55:05,127 --> 00:55:08,244
- I knew it...
- Excuse me...

311
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,563
With the kind of life he was leading sooner or later...

312
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:20,200
- How did it happen?
- It's the work of a mad man.

313
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:25,685
One can't explain it otherwise.
The same man who killed before...

314
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:51,075
Look, he broke the neck with one blow.
A fast death and no-one heard anything.

315
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:54,039
Do you think it was the same man?

316
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:58,239
Yes, I'm sure of it. I've sent out all my men to find him.

317
00:55:58,287 --> 00:56:02,166
- This time we can't let him escape.
- Yes, we must find this killer.

318
00:56:02,247 --> 00:56:04,317
Look for him everywhere!

319
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:19,156
You may go.

320
00:56:24,847 --> 00:56:30,126
- He can't be other than a mad man.
- There's something evil in these acts.

321
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:34,240
- You're right.
- And you must do everything in your power to catch him.

322
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:37,802
- Of course, Judge. Good-bye.
- Good Luck - Thanks.

323
00:56:40,367 --> 00:56:44,679
- Hey! Here's one! He's got the face of a criminal!
- Who can be?

324
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:49,198
- He's the killer! I'm sure of it! - Let's get him!
- He's covered in blood! It must be him!

325
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:52,205
- What are you saying? What blood?
- Stop! Come with us!

326
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:55,444
Let me go! I didn't do anything! It was just a chicken!

327
00:56:55,487 --> 00:56:58,604
- Let's hang him!
- What do want to do? It was lost and abandoned!

328
00:56:58,647 --> 00:57:02,401
- Ehi, you, stop! Let him go!

329
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:05,917
- Please policeman, protect me!
- You, come with me.

330
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:08,242
Killer!

331
00:57:10,567 --> 00:57:14,196
- I don't know anything! Why?
- Keep walking! - We found this vagabond.

332
00:57:14,247 --> 00:57:16,815
- What's all this confusion?
- He's the killer. He's still dirty with blood.

333
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:24,042
- Can you explain all that blood?
- It must be from the chicken.

334
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:30,003
- A chicken? Very well, we'll make sure of it.
- Don't believe him. That's the girl's blood.

335
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:32,402
We'll examine it immediately. Take him in!

336
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:35,007
Sir...

337
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:40,246
..listen to me, I didn't do anything.
I just stole a chicken because I was hungry.

338
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:43,723
- He's the killer! Let's hang him!
- I'm sincere! - Take him in now!

339
00:57:43,767 --> 00:57:48,841
- Please, I didn't do anything!
- If you're innocent you have nothing to fear.

340
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:52,880
- Believe me, Sir!
- I've never heard such bullshit!

341
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:56,317
Believe me! I didn't do anything!

342
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:01,598
Well?

343
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:05,806
It's a sort of shock. He just needs some rest.

344
00:58:05,847 --> 00:58:11,285
His immobility frightens me.
He's been like this for more than five days.

345
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:17,436
He must have fought against Boris killer.
This is the only explanation, Anne.

346
00:58:19,607 --> 00:58:22,075
What I don't understand is...

347
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:28,359
..what was he doing in my father's lab?

348
00:58:28,407 --> 00:58:31,956
I thought it had been destroyed after the accident.

349
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:35,079
Your husband must have restored it...

350
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:39,484
..and after fighting with the killer,
he went there to cure his wounds...

351
00:58:41,527 --> 00:58:43,677
..after that he fainted.

352
00:58:45,527 --> 00:58:49,918
It must have been a terrible experience.

353
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:55,246
- Will it have any consequences?
- No, I don't think so. He'll just need a few days of rest.

354
00:58:58,727 --> 00:59:03,198
- Don't worry, Anne.
- Thanks, Igor. - My duty.

355
00:59:03,247 --> 00:59:05,715
I'll show you out.

356
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:09,680
What amazes me is that the machine seems to have worked.

357
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:12,241
Yes, how is that possible?

358
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:47,998
Anne, excuse me if I speak to you like this
but I'm afraid for you.

359
00:59:48,047 --> 00:59:52,086
- But there's no more danger now.
- I'm worried.

360
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:58,642
Is there something you're hiding from me?
There have been no more incidents after the vagabond's arrest.

361
00:59:59,607 --> 01:00:01,040
Or is it not so?

362
01:00:01,087 --> 01:00:06,241
Yes of course, the have been no more murders...

363
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:09,006
..but, despite everything, I'm not calm.

364
01:00:09,047 --> 01:00:12,483
- Are you worried about me?
- Yes.

365
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:18,206
Anne, you're aware that I care about you very much.

366
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:27,362
- I love you.
- I'm tied to someone else.

367
01:00:28,007 --> 01:00:30,965
Yes, Anne, I know...

368
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:35,762
..but I would like to see you happy. Just that...

369
01:00:59,127 --> 01:01:02,039
There he is, sleeping like a baby.

370
01:01:03,887 --> 01:01:07,402
- He'll be judged in a week. Have you finished the investigation?
- Yes.

371
01:01:07,447 --> 01:01:11,076
- What conclusions have you reached?
- He has no alibi.

372
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:13,880
He admits of having spent the night in the barn...

373
01:01:13,927 --> 01:01:17,602
..but since we arrested him there have been no more murders.

374
01:01:17,647 --> 01:01:20,207
It wasn't me! Believe me!

375
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:25,116
I just stole! I didn't kill anyone! It's not true!

376
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:29,524
I've never heard the accused declare himself guilty.
We won't need his confession.

377
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:33,162
- Yes, everything points to his guilt.
- Very well.

378
01:01:33,207 --> 01:01:35,960
- I didn't kill anyone!
- That's what you say.

379
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:39,443
You'll be put on trial and the court will
establish your responsibilities.

380
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,047
- Let's go Inspector.
- Well.

381
01:01:43,407 --> 01:01:46,956
Listen to me! Please! I'm innocent!

382
01:01:47,007 --> 01:01:50,761
Believe me! Believe me...

383
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:19,124
- How do you feel, dear?
- A little better.

384
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:53,797
Do you need anything else?

385
01:02:57,967 --> 01:03:00,356
No, you're enough.

386
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:18,565
Igor told me that the worst is over
and in a few days you'll be as good as new.

387
01:03:18,607 --> 01:03:23,476
He has always been near you. I don't know what
I would have done without his help.

388
01:03:25,527 --> 01:03:32,080
- I'm in debt with out dear Igor.
- He just did what you'd have done in his place.

389
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:37,201
I had the opportunity to think a lot whule I was sick.

390
01:03:39,807 --> 01:03:41,957
About our life, our relationship...

391
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:47,557
I've become a burden for you.

392
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:49,882
Nothing has changed.

393
01:03:56,527 --> 01:03:58,643
Yes, Anne.

394
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:02,680
I've seen you come and go: an excellent nurse.

395
01:04:02,727 --> 01:04:05,195
A joy for any sick person.

396
01:04:06,767 --> 01:04:11,557
- But I never felt you were really close.
- We've had this discussion before.

397
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:15,325
But we never ended it.

398
01:04:15,367 --> 01:04:18,837
- And now there's another problem.
- What other problem?

399
01:04:19,887 --> 01:04:25,644
Igor. Our doctor is crazy about you...
and you're not indifferent to it.

400
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:28,599
- What are you saying, Alex?
- Please, Anne.

401
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:34,085
At least no lies. No I don't blame you for it.

402
01:04:34,127 --> 01:04:39,360
I still love you, even if I know I've lost you.

403
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:41,841
You're being foolish! It's not true!

404
01:04:41,887 --> 01:04:48,201
- Don't worry about me, it would be useless.
- But I'm tied to you.

405
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:52,877
Can you tie the wind? Or imprison the waves?

406
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:56,397
From now on you can consider yourself free.

407
01:04:56,447 --> 01:04:59,086
It's better for both of us.

408
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:16,719
Silence! Silence!

409
01:05:17,287 --> 01:05:23,317
This court has been called to judge Fiòdor Polanski
of the terrible crimes he's been charged with.

410
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:28,680
The violent and savage murders of five of our townspeople.

411
01:05:28,727 --> 01:05:31,287
We've listened to the absurd assertions made...

412
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:38,119
..by the accused to justify the spots of blood,
an evident proof of his crimes.

413
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:42,046
But nothing that we've heard has changed the opinion...

414
01:05:42,087 --> 01:05:50,005
that the accused is the only and real responsible
for the charges he's been indicted for.

415
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:55,167
It's enough to look into his eyes to be convinced of his offense.

416
01:05:55,207 --> 01:05:59,644
- Theodore Polanski!
- Stand up. Hey, stand up.

417
01:06:02,047 --> 01:06:06,757
Do you have anything to say to this court of law
before I pronounce your sentence?

418
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:11,600
You want to condemn me but I haven't done anything of
what you accuse me of.

419
01:06:11,647 --> 01:06:16,482
- You're making a big mistake.
- We are the ones to judge, not you.

420
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:22,159
But you want to condemn me for having
killed all those people who I didn't even know.

421
01:06:22,207 --> 01:06:26,519
I didn't kill anyone. I just stole a chicken.

422
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:30,037
Have pity on me, listen to me. I'm innocent.

423
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:36,799
- It would be an infamous act to condemn me.
- Be quiet! Impostor! Stop offending this court!

424
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:42,041
- I'm sorry. I didn't do anything.
- Silence!

425
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:45,682
God is witness to my innocence.

426
01:06:45,727 --> 01:06:50,005
This court finds you guilty of the murders
you've been accused of...

427
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:55,758
..I therefore condemn you to hanged by the neck until dead.

428
01:06:55,807 --> 01:06:58,879
The sentence will be carried out as soon as possible.

429
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:01,964
No! I'm innocent!

430
01:07:03,207 --> 01:07:06,244
May God have pity on your soul.

431
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:15,165
It wasn't a good idea to come to the village in your conditions.

432
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:17,437
But i...

433
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:20,324
..feel better now.

434
01:07:20,967 --> 01:07:24,562
I felt very sorry for that man. He's seemed sincere.

435
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:27,758
- Yes, I agree. I'm dubious too.
- Why?

436
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:32,927
There can't be any other explanation.
He's a psychopath. He's guilty.

437
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:35,561
I looked at him carefully during the trial...

438
01:07:35,607 --> 01:07:39,805
But you didn't recognize him as the man you fought with.

439
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:44,522
It was very dark that night. I'm not sure.

440
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:48,481
In any case, it wasn't necessary.

441
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:51,599
There were already much proof against him.

442
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:54,605
But what if he was really innocent?

443
01:07:54,647 --> 01:07:57,161
It would be a terrible crime...

444
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:03,595
..and this nightmare wouldn't be over for us.

445
01:08:04,287 --> 01:08:08,200
It's crazy just to think about it.

446
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:12,877
Excuse me, but it's late. I have to go, Madam.

447
01:08:14,847 --> 01:08:17,441
Doctor, I wanted to ask you something.

448
01:08:17,487 --> 01:08:24,199
It was just out of curiosity, for a hobby
that I reactivated the machine.

449
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:29,560
- A very dangerous hobby, I would say.
- You've been careless, Alex.

450
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:33,202
I wanted to... I wanted to know...

451
01:08:33,247 --> 01:08:36,080
..if you were the one to find me when I fainted in there.

452
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:37,958
Yes.

453
01:08:42,487 --> 01:08:44,717
You were very sick.

454
01:08:45,607 --> 01:08:47,723
Yes, it's true...

455
01:08:47,767 --> 01:08:53,285
.. I had a... I managed to... tell absurd words?

456
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:56,956
You were unconscious. Why do you want to know?

457
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:02,202
Just curious...

458
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:09,278
You were sick but, luckily, I found you rather quickly
and now you're well again.

459
01:09:09,327 --> 01:09:11,602
I don't remember anything.

460
01:09:12,927 --> 01:09:15,122
No.

461
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:17,237
Nothing.

462
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:22,761
- You'l regain your memory.
- No! No, it's not that...

463
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:30,324
You shouldn't worry about my memory...

464
01:09:31,247 --> 01:09:34,876
So...

465
01:09:34,927 --> 01:09:37,441
It's rather hot tonight...

466
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,162
No, no...

467
01:09:42,207 --> 01:09:45,404
..my memory... You must excuse me...

468
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:49,156
- Do you want me to take you home?
- No, thank you. I'm fine.

469
01:09:56,327 --> 01:10:00,684
I think he's suffering a lot and I don't know how to help him.

470
01:10:00,727 --> 01:10:06,518
- What can we do, Igor?
- Very little, Anne. He must come out of it on his own.

471
01:10:13,447 --> 01:10:16,007
His behaviour frightens me.

472
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:20,162
That's why...

473
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:23,558
..you have to leave him.

474
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:26,644
I would if he were normal.

475
01:10:28,487 --> 01:10:33,197
- But you can't go on like this.
- I can't look inside myself, Igor.

476
01:10:33,247 --> 01:10:35,681
What can I do?

477
01:10:54,447 --> 01:10:56,915
You're free!

478
01:10:56,967 --> 01:11:00,926
Free to do whatever you want!
I can't kill you twice! No!

479
01:11:00,967 --> 01:11:07,042
- No! - No.
- I don't want to!

480
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:11,046
Stop it! Damn you! No! No!

481
01:11:15,727 --> 01:11:18,287
No, Never! No!

482
01:11:18,967 --> 01:11:23,404
What can we do, Anne? We have to think of ourselves,
don't you think?

483
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:27,326
I can't decide like this. I have to wait until he's better.

484
01:11:27,367 --> 01:11:30,882
Don't worry about me. I'll wait if necessary.

485
01:11:30,927 --> 01:11:33,725
I know, Igor. I've never doubted you.

486
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:37,157
Whatever you decide I'll always love you, Anne.

487
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:41,839
I'm convinced of your feelings.

488
01:11:41,887 --> 01:11:46,915
- I worry about you being alone.
- Once locked, this house is like a prison.

489
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:49,481
I'll be back early tomorrow.

490
01:11:51,047 --> 01:11:52,275
See you tomorrow.

491
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:07,202
- I'll keep an eye on the house.
- Good night, Igor. - Good night.

492
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:12,806
No! Alex!

493
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,441
What do you want? What's happening to you?

494
01:13:16,687 --> 01:13:19,247
I don't understand!

495
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:20,925
What do you want to do?

496
01:13:21,447 --> 01:13:24,564
Ah! No!

497
01:13:27,247 --> 01:13:29,158
Igor!

498
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:38,200
No, Alex! No!

499
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,523
No, no! I don't want to! No!

500
01:13:50,327 --> 01:13:54,684
Not like this! Let me go!

501
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:59,360
No, no! You're killing me like this! No!

502
01:14:00,327 --> 01:14:02,238
Anne!

503
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:03,686
Anne!

504
01:14:06,727 --> 01:14:08,445
Open the door! Open up!

505
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:11,157
Let me go!

506
01:14:13,327 --> 01:14:17,240
Anne! My love! Open the door!

507
01:14:24,447 --> 01:14:26,563
Open the door! Damn you!

508
01:14:31,487 --> 01:14:33,717
No! I don't want to!

509
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:36,559
Damn you! Open up!

510
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:41,123
No! Let me go! Let me go, please!

511
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:43,840
Anne! Open the door!

512
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,956
Igor! Igor!

513
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:50,123
Anne, my love!

514
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:52,997
No, no!

515
01:14:53,047 --> 01:14:55,197
My god, No!

516
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:05,038
I love you , Anne. I love you.

517
01:15:06,447 --> 01:15:09,041
No, no!

518
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:05,917
Aniuska.

519
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:09,635
Listen to me.

520
01:16:13,287 --> 01:16:17,439
Don't treat me like this. Don't leave me, please.

521
01:16:17,487 --> 01:16:20,797
There's nothing that can't be solved between us.

522
01:16:20,847 --> 01:16:23,315
Nothing is beyond repair.

523
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:25,358
What is this?

524
01:16:27,567 --> 01:16:29,603
What is this?

525
01:16:40,527 --> 01:16:43,963
My God! What happened?

526
01:16:45,527 --> 01:16:47,518
What happened?

527
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:49,797
Aniuska.

528
01:17:04,687 --> 01:17:08,521
It can't be.

529
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:12,163
You can't leave me like this.

530
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:14,696
Aniuska, please my love... You can't abandon me...
Tell me, aniuska, tell me!

531
01:17:14,747 --> 01:17:18,720
What lovers haven't felt the bite of jealousy?

532
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:21,156
They are proofs of love...

533
01:17:21,207 --> 01:17:24,722
And you know that I love you more than anything, Aniuska.

534
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:29,841
I can't love any other woman as much as I love you.
No other woman.

535
01:17:29,887 --> 01:17:33,516
My friend... Tell me you love me... Aniuska.

536
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,127
Tell me, Aniuska. Please.

537
01:17:36,167 --> 01:17:39,443
Aniuska, forgive me.

538
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:55,084
This is how it is, Alex. This is how it is.

539
01:17:56,407 --> 01:18:02,516
- No...
- You wanted her to be all yours and now she is, Alex. She is!

540
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:07,604
No...

541
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:15,038
This is not what I wanted. I didn't want to, Aniuska.

542
01:18:15,087 --> 01:18:18,318
Please believe me.

543
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,517
Aniuska...

544
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:24,799
It wasn't me who wanted all of this, Aniuska.

545
01:18:26,447 --> 01:18:32,158
You must believe me, my love!
Don't punish me with your silence.

546
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:36,962
I need you, Aniuska! Answer me! Answer me!

547
01:18:37,007 --> 01:18:40,443
Answer me! Don't punish me like this!

548
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:43,206
Aniuska!

549
01:18:43,247 --> 01:18:47,365
Believe me! No...

550
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,758
Accept the truth, Alex. She's dead!

551
01:18:55,047 --> 01:19:01,077
You killed her! And now you're mine!
You're mine, Alex!

552
01:19:01,127 --> 01:19:03,721
Murderer!

553
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:09,797
I promise you, my love, I won't allow him to kill again.
I won't allow him!

554
01:19:09,847 --> 01:19:13,476
No! You'll never have me! Never! Never!

555
01:19:13,527 --> 01:19:16,917
Never! You'll never have me!

556
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:38,680
- Move it! Come on!
- I don't want to!

557
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:40,922
No! Let me go!

558
01:19:46,207 --> 01:19:50,359
Wait! Stop!

559
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:56,277
Wait!

560
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:35,238
God, what did I do wrong?
What did I do wrong?

561
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:03,926
It's me... It's me you have to kill!

562
01:21:04,847 --> 01:21:06,803
Stop!

563
01:21:06,847 --> 01:21:08,917
Stop!

564
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:23,846
Get up.

565
01:21:37,327 --> 01:21:40,444
Wait! Wait!

566
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:45,237
I'm innocent.

567
01:21:59,807 --> 01:22:03,004
Justice has been made.

568
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,237
Murderers!

569
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:12,919
- Idiots! It wasn't him! - Be careful, Judge!
- Are you crazy?

570
01:22:12,967 --> 01:22:15,242
- Stop!
- He's innocent!

571
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:20,397
Forgive me! Forgive me!
