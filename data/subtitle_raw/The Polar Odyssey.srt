1
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,980
(Somewhere in the North Pole)

2
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,140
Go get some rest.

3
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,060
Okay.

4
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,460
Hello?

5
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,340
Hello?

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,660
Hello?

7
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,540
(The Polar Odyssey)

8
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,220
(Ten days ago)
(A country in East Asia)

9
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,220
(News: The Metropolitan Museum was robbed
and an ancient Chinese silk book was stolen)

10
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,500
(An Asian researcher was killed)

11
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,580
Hey, you want more drinks?

12
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,940
Use your useless life to make some money.

13
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,060
Amazing.

14
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,980
I won again.

15
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,500
Now, I feel sorry.

16
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,300
Hey.

17
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:45,940
What...

18
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,940
What are you doing?

19
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,140
Give me your camera.

20
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,140
Hello?

21
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,100
Chinese, piss off.

22
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,420
You're Chinese?

23
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,220
Hold this.

24
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,660
You got some moves. I like that.

25
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,700
Let go of me!

26
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,020
The camera. Give it to me.

27
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,820
You can't do that.

28
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,540
This is a robbery.

29
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,620
I can't?

30
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,060
Can I?

31
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,660
Can I? What do you think?

32
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Work for me, and you can have the girl.

33
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,860
I'm not interested.

34
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,140
Don't be so ungrateful.

35
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,340
Then it's your lucky day.

36
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,100
I've got some skills as well.

37
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,620
No.

38
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,420
No.

39
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,860
My friends.

40
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,860
My friends,

41
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,940
There is an old Chinese saying
that peace brings wealth.

42
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,940
Look at you.

43
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,300
You are being very violent.

44
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,380
That will make it easy for you to get angry

45
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,660
causing an imbalance of yin and yang,

46
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,220
headache, insomnia,
bitterness in the mouth, and blood vomiting.

47
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,540
That will also make you
feel bloated and fart frequently.

48
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,100
If things get serious,
you might also have menstrual disorders.

49
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,100
Why not live in peace?

50
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,740
What was that? Get him.

51
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,300
Who are you?

52
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,780
Take it easy.

53
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,700
Take it easy.

54
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,300
We can talk. Let's talk.

55
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,860
Yuan Zhen, it's been a while.

56
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:54,980
Go there.

57
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,540
You're a good hider, aren't you?

58
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,980
Why are you here?

59
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,900
We've got to talk business.

60
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,820
Let's go.

61
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,740
Thank you for your help.

62
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,460
Once we arrive in the town, I'll buy you

63
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,100
the best Korean barbecue.

64
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,580
Zhen,

65
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,260
aren't you going to introduce her to us?

66
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,940
I am Luo Lan, a journalist.

67
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,100
This is my press card.

68
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,100
Your Chinese is pretty good.

69
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,900
My father was Chinese.

70
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,860
What a knight in shining armor.

71
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,140
Why did such good things never happen to me?

72
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,740
Me, Husky,

73
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,700
I've traveled

74
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,260
all the mountains and seas.

75
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,660
But I've never met a girl

76
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
who was interested in me.

77
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,860
Where is fairness?

78
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,780
We're going to make a deal here.

79
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
Join us, Zhen.

80
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,140
It's time to get back in the game.

81
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,660
I'm not interested.

82
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,900
Yuan Zhen,

83
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,180
it's been two years.

84
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,020
You need to move on.

85
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,580
It was just an accident.

86
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,860
How long do you plan on hiding here?

87
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,580
This deal is about a silk book.

88
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,100
If it's about the silk book,

89
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,380
will you be interested?

90
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,620
After the book was stolen in the United States,

91
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,420
it disappeared.

92
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,060
I've used all my resources

93
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,460
to locate its position.

94
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,180
Zhen,

95
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,740
Jiang sacrificed her life for this book.

96
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,220
Aren't you interested at all?

97
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,780
Husky.

98
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,340
Who wants the book?

99
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,980
You know the rules.

100
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,500
I'm in.

101
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:43,860
Where is it?

102
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,100
In the underground market.

103
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,180
I think we need a translator.

104
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,020
What about that girl?

105
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,460
Translator?

106
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,660
No problem.

107
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,020
Tell us.

108
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,260
How much do you want?

109
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,460
I don't want money.

110
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,260
But I have one condition.

111
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,460
After the deal, I'd like to interview him.

112
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,660
So where exactly are we going?

113
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,220
We're going to one of the darkest,

114
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,940
nastiest, and most chaotic places.

115
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,540
(The underground market.)

116
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:29,020
(Chinatown)

117
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,300
Darn. This place stinks.

118
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,180
Be careful.

119
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,460
Aren't you coming?

120
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,940
I'll wait outside.

121
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,380
Let's go. Aren't you a journalist?

122
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,900
Don't worry. Zhen is here.

123
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,420
You'll be safe.

124
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,740
Go. Let's go.

125
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,860
Is it a genuine article?

126
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:11,900
Hello, sir.

127
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,980
Little brat. I'll slap you.

128
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,860
Let him go.

129
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,140
Are you Master San's friends?

130
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,020
Yes.

131
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,580
Come with me.

132
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,820
She asked us to go with her.

133
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,100
Let's go.

134
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,060
Have you brought your money?

135
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,660
They want to see the money first.

136
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,900
We'll check the goods first.

137
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,700
Zhen.

138
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,140
Thank you.

139
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,700
Hold on.

140
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,220
We still have unfinished business.

141
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,780
Sir,

142
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,060
didn't we just close our deal?

143
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,540
Is there any unfinished business?

144
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,460
Someone paid for your lives.

145
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,300
Wait.

146
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,180
You guys are really good at running.

147
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,060
Keep running.

148
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,580
Here, I am the king.

149
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,100
Go get them!

150
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,060
Take them down.

151
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,060
Hurry.

152
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,100
Come on.

153
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,980
Do it!

154
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,340
Why don't you move?

155
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,580
I

156
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,020
have delivered them to you.

157
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,020
Aren't you the king here?

158
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,860
Take care of them yourself.

159
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,660
I've paid you a considerable amount of money.

160
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,900
You want to play on both sides, don't you?

161
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,860
Stupid teddy bear.

162
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,220
Kill them.

163
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,100
Don't you dare.

164
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,900
Wait.

165
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,380
Keep him alive.

166
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,820
I want a souvenir.

167
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,860
Sir, we'll leave you to it then.

168
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,380
We are not going to bother you.

169
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,100
Goodbye.

170
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,180
Sir, what else do you need?

171
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,460
Leave the thing.

172
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,140
Why?

173
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,900
I saved your lives.

174
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,980
Shouldn't you thank me?

175
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,900
Thank you, sir.

176
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,140
Thank you.

177
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,180
Forgive our impoliteness.

178
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,140
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

179
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,500
You

180
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,700
come here and kiss my hand.

181
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,860
No, no, stop.

182
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,540
Sir, you could have said that earlier.

183
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,820
Nowadays

184
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,060
everyone is a fan of French culture.

185
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:07,940
Let me do it.

186
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,540
Let me kiss your hand.

187
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,700
I'm not interested in you.

188
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,660
Do you really want me to do this?

189
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,100
I do.

190
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:36,980
Run.

191
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,900
Kill them.

192
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,740
Zhen.

193
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,420
Go.

194
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,140
Let's go.

195
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,100
Gorgeous,

196
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,620
you go first.

197
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,180
I'll help Zhen.

198
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,100
Shoot.

199
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,100
Shoot him.

200
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,580
Zhen, let's go.

201
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,020
Go after them.

202
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,620
Hurry. Hurry.

203
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,060
Oh, my God!

204
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,420
This building is so splendid.

205
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,020
Good job.

206
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,500
Mr. Jin is in a meeting right now.

207
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,020
Please take a short recess.

208
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,700
Thank you.

209
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,900
Mr. Jin is in a meeting. She asked us to rest first.

210
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,140
Please come with me.

211
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,020
This Mr. Jin lives in such a big house alone.

212
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,500
I bet he is weird.

213
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,180
Shut up.

214
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,100
Come in.

215
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,780
Can I help you?

216
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,300
You agreed to be interviewed.
Are you available now?

217
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,900
I don't have any stories to tell.

218
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,140
You are a famous explorer,

219
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,620
who hides in South Korea and does illegal boxing.

220
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,900
How can you not have stories to tell?

221
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,780
I have something for you.

222
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,940
How come you have it?

223
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,820
I found it in the Boxing Club

224
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,180
and asked a watchmaker to fix it.

225
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,900
Why did you ask people to fix it?

226
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,660
Does this watch

227
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,980
have great meaning to you?

228
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,140
The person who gave me this watch

229
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
passed away two years ago.

230
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,020
I'm sorry.

231
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
Did she

232
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,380
have an accident?

233
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,780
If I had been with her,

234
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,220
there wouldn't have been an accident.

235
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,220
Was she an explorer as well?

236
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,020
She was an archaeologist.

237
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,300
Two years ago, she asked me to go

238
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,300
to the United States
to work on the silk book with her.

239
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,860
At that time, I was buried in my own stuff,

240
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,980
so I didn't go.

241
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,860
So two years ago,

242
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,860
she was one of the staff members

243
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,940
who died in the robbery
of the Metropolitan Museum.

244
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,780
Mr. Jin can see you now.

245
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,820
You may leave.

246
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,500
Guys, good job.

247
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,300
He said, "Good job."

248
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,460
We did more than just a good job.

249
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,020
We almost sacrificed our lives.

250
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,260
You need to tell him to pay us more.

251
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,940
Husky.

252
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,420
No problem.

253
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,340
I'll double your payment, okay?

254
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,140
Mr. Jin, you can speak Chinese?

255
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,020
I spent some time in China a long time ago.

256
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,540
Sorry, Mr. Jin, please don't mind him.

257
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,740
Sorry, please forgive my rudeness.

258
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,780
Mr. Jin,

259
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,820
may I ask you a question?

260
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,340
The silk book is one of China's
lost national treasures.

261
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,980
Why do you want to buy it?

262
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,220
Honestly, I have no obligation
to explain it to you.

263
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,420
I can only say that it's very important
for personal reasons.

264
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,060
I'd like to buy the book.

265
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,820
All right.

266
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,820
Now it's my mealtime.

267
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,060
If you are interested,

268
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,580
please let me entertain you.

269
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,020
We can talk over dinner.

270
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,260
Please.

271
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,780
Mr. Jin,

272
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,380
thank you for trusting my team.

273
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,700
I've heard a lot about you guys.

274
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,820
Death Valley, Krubera Cave,

275
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,540
and Uyuni Salt Flat.

276
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,380
You've been everywhere.

277
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,460
Master San represents professional work.

278
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,020
Mr. Yuan's life experience

279
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,700
also deserves my admiration.

280
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,140
What about me?

281
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,340
Let's get down to business.

282
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,060
Many years ago, I went to China.

283
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,700
Back then,

284
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,700
I was Ke Qiang's assistant.

285
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,020
After Professor Ke Qiang got the silk book,

286
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,620
he studied it for several years.

287
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,540
Eventually, he found out

288
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,980
that the silk book

289
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,300
is not only the record of China's creation myth,

290
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,180
but also a record of a legendary treasure

291
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,340
in a certain way.

292
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,540
The silk book.

293
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,940
Nuwa.

294
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,660
Can it be...?

295
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,220
Yes, the Stone of Nuwa.

296
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,220
Oh, my God.

297
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,380
It is said that the Stone of Nuwa
can reverse time and space,

298
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,260
and send people back to the past.

299
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,580
I promise to return the silk book
to China unconditionally

300
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,660
after finding the Stone of Nuwa.

301
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,460
That would be great.

302
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,700
Thanks. Thank you.

303
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,020
However, before finding the Stone of Nuwa,

304
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,060
I won't give you the silk book.

305
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,740
How do I know that you'll keep your promise?

306
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,380
If you don't believe me,

307
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,860
you can go and find the Stone of Nuwa with me.

308
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,020
Once I find it,

309
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,580
I will give the silk book to you.

310
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,540
Mr. Jin...

311
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,540
I'll go with you.

312
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,300
If you'd like,

313
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,940
you can stay at my place.

314
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,780
We can talk about the secret of the silk book.

315
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,100
About your watch,

316
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,140
I'm sorry.

317
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,900
It's okay.

318
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,260
I overreacted.

319
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,980
May I ask you a question?

320
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,940
Go ahead.

321
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,500
If you were able to go back in time,

322
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
what would you do?

323
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,100
You would find her back,

324
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,060
right?

325
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,100
What about you?

326
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,620
What would you do?

327
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:36,940
This.

328
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,300
It was a birthday present from my parents

329
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,500
when I turned eight.

330
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,820
They bought it from a very famous

331
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,180
old Korean craftsman.

332
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,300
But soon after that, they passed away.

333
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,820
So I've kept it as my amulet

334
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,660
and taken it with me everywhere.

335
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,980
Maybe this thing is too old.

336
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,660
It broke some time ago.

337
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,140
Well,

338
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,100
can it be fixed?

339
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,420
I was going to buy a new one.

340
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,140
But that store was closed.

341
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,380
That old craftsman also passed away.

342
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,940
The stars in the sky are gorgeous.

343
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,980
When do you think

344
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,260
we'll be able

345
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,540
to go up there?

346
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,820
You can explore them and I can find stories.

347
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,580
Those are all fixed stars

348
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,460
that will make us evaporate like water
as soon as we get close to them.

349
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,300
Can't you be romantic? No wonder you're single.

350
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,980
You aren't angry, are you?

351
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,220
I get it.

352
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,940
What do you mean?

353
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,500
These light spots do not appear
to be randomly distributed.

354
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,860
They may be related to the Stone of Nuwa.

355
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,100
You mean

356
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,540
the light projected by this book

357
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,820
is what constitutes the real treasure map.

358
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,140
Could be.

359
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,740
Think about the content of the book.

360
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
God will stop fate from giving human benefits.

361
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,140
When fate brings disasters upon human beings,
God will give benefits.

362
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,500
It's related to astronomical phenomena.

363
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,420
Celestial Sphere Stars Map.

364
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,580
But it didn't mark

365
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,140
the true location of the Stone of Nuwa.

366
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
Indeed.

367
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,420
Thuban.

368
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,380
What does it mean?

369
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,260
Thuban,

370
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,140
in the modern astrological system,

371
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,860
is called Alpha Draconis.

372
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,740
It's the Polaris recorded in ancient China.

373
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,020
According to the Book of Changes,

374
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,020
All natural creatures are born in the East.
January is the first month of spring.

375
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,540
Arcturus is the first star of the Lunar Mansions.

376
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,220
It is said that in 3,800 BC

377
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,860
when Nuwa mended the sky

378
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,860
because of a hole broken in it.

379
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,460
The North Pole was ruined, and the earth was split.

380
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,420
So the Stone of Nuwa fell at the North Pole.

381
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,260
Wait.

382
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,060
It's been almost 6,000 years.

383
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,220
The position of the North Pole
should have changed.

384
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,420
Let's assume

385
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,460
the North Pole has moved at the speed

386
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,020
of 15 Angular seconds a year.

387
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,820
It's now at 66 degrees north latitude,

388
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,420
22 degrees 13 minutes east longitude.

389
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,700
It's in Banak, Norway.

390
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,380
Right in the Arctic Circle.

391
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,540
It's the year of Mouse,

392
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,140
the best time to cross the gate
of the heavenly palace.

393
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,780
Get ready. We are going to the North Pole.

394
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,700
Sir, they're going to the North Pole.

395
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,020
Relax, you will be safe.

396
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,300
Take a deep breath with me.

397
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,900
Relax, Master San.

398
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,220
Wait, I...

399
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,500
Feeling better?

400
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,060
Much better.

401
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,860
We are here.

402
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,540
Close the door. Close it.

403
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,580
My noodles are cold.

404
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,700
Stop researching.

405
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,100
I promise you'll take it back.

406
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:05,820
Gorgeous,

407
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,860
how do you keep your promise?

408
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,060
What is this?

409
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,260
What's wrong? No signal?

410
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,260
The dense fog is like a black box.

411
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,700
Be careful when you go in there.

412
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,260
Miss Korea,

413
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,740
hello.

414
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,940
Hello.

415
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,580
It's so foggy here.

416
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,860
I don't understand.

417
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,420
Translator, translator.

418
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,180
Please tell her that I think

419
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,860
she is very beautiful.

420
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,540
Thank you.

421
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,100
Whatever he says,

422
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,860
just smile and nod.

423
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,380
Understand?

424
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:28,980
Thank you.

425
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,500
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

426
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,180
I like you.

427
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,340
Okay.

428
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,620
Do you like me?

429
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,460
Okay.

430
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,340
Let's exchange our phone numbers.

431
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,380
Zhen,

432
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,460
take a look.

433
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,900
Don't look.

434
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,060
The team member that went missing.

435
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,940
The fog is getting thicker.

436
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,620
We can't stop here.

437
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,060
Wait, guys.

438
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,580
We should be close.

439
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,260
We are at the North Pole 5,000 years ago.

440
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,820
Zhen,

441
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,820
There's a cave mouth here.

442
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,700
We can't break it open.

443
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,940
Get ready to blow it up.

444
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,260
What did they say?

445
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,420
They will blow it up.

446
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:44,860
Okay, okay.

447
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,220
I'll leave it to you.

448
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,900
Yuan Zhen,

449
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,340
I have something to talk to you about.

450
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,820
Please come with me.

451
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Luo Lan.

452
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:23,820
Come here.

453
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:24,860
What?

454
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,260
Sit down.

455
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,540
I want to give you this.

456
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,220
To me?

457
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,740
To keep you safe.

458
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,580
What about you?

459
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,860
My parents will protect me in heaven.

460
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,900
Do you still remember

461
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,060
what we talked about on the balcony that day?

462
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,700
I remember.

463
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,300
If we could go back in time,

464
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,620
there're some things

465
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,020
I would do differently.

466
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:49,780
Yuan Zhen,

467
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,340
I mean...

468
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,540
Actually, I also have something to say.

469
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,500
I had been living in the past,

470
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,500
and refusing to move on.

471
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,460
But now I've realized

472
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,980
that some people are doomed
to remain in our hearts forever

473
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,300
but not necessarily by our sides.

474
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,540
I wanted to say...

475
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:26,740
I'll check it out.

476
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,700
Wait for me.

477
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,620
Zhen,

478
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,940
it's open.

479
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,020
Nobody moves.

480
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,220
Does anyone else want to resist?

481
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,740
He kept waiting for us to find the location
before he showed up.

482
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,420
The Stone of Nuwa

483
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,700
also interests me.

484
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,740
Help me find the Stone of Nuwa,

485
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,940
and we will be even.

486
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,180
Stop.

487
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,340
Sir,

488
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,740
we could talk. It's not a big deal,

489
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,260
right?

490
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,500
They're all yours.

491
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,060
Even the North Pole is yours.

492
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,020
Am I right?

493
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:27,900
Zhen.

494
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,220
Zhen.

495
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,620
Let's go.

496
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:02,940
Hurry up.

497
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:37,660
Go.

498
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:38,980
Go.

499
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,940
Hurry.

500
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,460
After them!

501
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,340
Hurry.

502
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,460
Come on.

503
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,380
They didn't come after us.

504
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,540
Let's take a rest here.

505
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,060
I'll check the surroundings.

506
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,580
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

507
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:50,940
Zhen,

508
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,220
what do we do?

509
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:52,460
Who is there?

510
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,620
I don't want to die.

511
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,820
Please let me go.

512
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,780
I am just an employee.

513
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,660
Let me go, I'm begging you.

514
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,620
Come out.

515
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,420
In China,

516
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,460
there is an old saying,

517
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,900
don't make this harder than it has to be.

518
00:45:59,420 --> 00:45:59,780
No.

519
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:00,940
No.

520
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,740
Stop.

521
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,660
Yuan Zhen, what are you doing?

522
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,260
You can't burn the silk book.

523
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,660
Do you still want the Stone of Nuwa?

524
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,300
You won't burn it.

525
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,740
What are those?

526
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,940
So poisonous. Once they bite us, we are bound to die.

527
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,780
Don't get bitten, guys.

528
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,140
Don't move.

529
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,220
Shoot them.

530
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,380
Thank you.

531
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:38,660
Help me.

532
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,500
Help me.

533
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,260
They are scared of fire.

534
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,020
There is an exit.

535
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,100
Let's go.

536
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,460
Go.

537
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,020
Come on.

538
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,220
Go.

539
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,260
Come on.

540
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:43,980
Try harder.

541
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,180
Save me.

542
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,140
It's too dangerous.

543
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,620
Push, you stupid fat.

544
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,780
It's too dangerous.

545
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,820
Go now.

546
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,340
Check what's ahead.

547
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:53,780
Go.

548
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,180
Give me the ropes. Hurry.

549
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,660
Wait.

550
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,860
Hurry. Go.

551
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:14,260
Luo Lan, what are you doing?

552
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,500
Come here. Left.

553
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,380
Zhen, hurry.

554
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:04,780
This way.

555
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,540
Master San, you go first. Gear up.

556
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,060
Block the hole with this.

557
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,660
Be careful.

558
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:49,820
Watch out.

559
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:53,900
Master San.

560
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,220
Zhen, I'm afraid the rope
can't take that much weight.

561
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,100
We have no time to hesitate.

562
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,020
Hold on to the rope.

563
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:12,740
Hang in there.

564
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,460
Give me your hand.

565
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,700
Master San.

566
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,260
Hold on.

567
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:30,860
Hold on.

568
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,660
Master San, hang in there.

569
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,140
Hold tight.

570
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,780
Tighter, tighter.

571
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,260
Yuan Zhen,

572
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,340
let me go.

573
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,660
I won't.

574
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,300
Yuan Zhen, if you don't let me go, we'll both die.

575
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,940
What are you doing?

576
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,340
Don't let go.

577
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,620
Master San.

578
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,100
Yuan Zhen,

579
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,780
let me go.

580
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,140
No.

581
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,340
Master San!

582
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:19,780
It's out.

583
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:21,700
The fire's out.

584
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,820
Zhen, move.

585
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,740
Go. Just leave me alone.

586
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,980
Hold the rope.

587
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,540
Zhen,

588
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,140
we'll be best buddies again in the next life.

589
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,420
Husky!

590
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,180
Yuan Zhen,

591
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,140
give me your hand.

592
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,500
Yuan Zhen.

593
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:09,740
Yuan Zhen.

594
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,900
The Stone of Nuwa.

595
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,300
Where is the Stone of Nuwa?

596
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,140
Old man,

597
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,380
move aside.

598
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:15,980
They lied to you,

599
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,180
you idiot.

600
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,260
She's been lying to you.

601
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,100
Jin Yongzhe

602
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,620
is Luo Lan's grandfather.

603
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,020
Luo Lan,

604
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,220
the Stone of Nuwa is mine.

605
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,260
Yuan Zhen,

606
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,260
get me the Stone of Nuwa.

607
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,980
Get it for me.

608
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,940
Give it to me.

609
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,500
Give it to me.

610
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,540
Give it to me.

611
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,100
Give it to me.

612
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,660
Give it to me!

613
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,460
Grandpa!

614
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,180
Move!

615
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,020
What are you doing? Stop.

616
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:11,700
Let go.

617
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,060
Luo Lan.

618
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,300
Luo Lan.

619
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,020
I...

620
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,340
I am sorry.

621
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,500
I've been wanting to tell you.

622
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,380
Give it to me!

623
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:02,700
Master San.

624
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,820
Husky.

625
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:09,700
Hold tight.

626
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,220
Zhen,

627
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,580
we'll be best buddies again

628
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:14,980
in the next life.

629
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,540
Great. Yuan Zhen,

630
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,740
get me the Stone of Nuwa.

631
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,060
The Stone of Nuwa is way too powerful.

632
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,820
You can't control it.

633
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,300
You've tried it, haven't you?

634
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,180
We can't change our fate.

635
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,940
We must learn to accept it.

636
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,100
I don't care.

637
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,740
Luo Lan, help Grandpa get the Stone of Nuwa.

638
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,340
Do you know everything?

639
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:50,860
I'm sorry.

640
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,580
Luo Lan, are you going to disobey me?

641
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,260
If we go back in time,

642
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,500
I might not exist anymore.

643
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,620
No matter what changes,

644
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,180
I'll always be your grandpa.

645
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,540
No, you'll be someone else.

646
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,900
But I don't have time.

647
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,300
No.

648
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:18,460
Luo Lan,

649
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,060
how are you?

650
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:29,940
I'm sorry.

651
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,220
It's fine.

652
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,140
Grandpa.

653
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,380
I'll wait for you in the past.

-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

669

Thank you. Thanks.

670
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,700
Zhen,

671
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,580
how did you know that the silk book
was in the underground market?

672
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,060
Guess.

673
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,020
Guess?

674
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,620
Why do I sense something weird about that?

675
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,860
You didn't do anything behind our backs, did you?

676
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,260
Stop guessing. Let's go.

677
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,780
At the thought of having donated

678
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,460
such a valuable silk book,

679
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,420
my heart starts bleeding.

680
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,900
Can't you be a little patriotic?

681
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,300
My God, does the sun rise in the west today?

682
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,460
A businesswoman talks about being patriotic.

683
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:21,100
Master San, the more I get to know you,
the more I admire you.

684
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:21,780
Piss off.

685
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,300
You two go first.

686
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:24,980
I have some personal business.

687
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,100
Look, look.

688
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,540
I told you he's up to something.

689
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,460
Shut up.

690
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,980
I won't inform you if I have business in the future.

691
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:33,460
Come on, Master San.

692
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,060
I have...

693
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,140
I still have to pay my mortgage for ten years.

694
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,420
Master San.

695
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:02,780
Aren't you that...

696
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,220
It's me.

697
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:05,740
Hello,

698
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,180
may I have an interview with you?

699
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,020
Of course.

700
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,020
Thank you.

701
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,580
Then let's begin.

702
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,100
Hold on.

703
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,460
I need to ask you a question.

704
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,820
Is this yours?
