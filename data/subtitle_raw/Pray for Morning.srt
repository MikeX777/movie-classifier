<i>Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)</i>]

[bell ringing]

4
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,042
All right, darlin',
I'm so glad to see you.

5
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,242
You can read that book when we get home.
Come on, girl.

00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,675
[indistinct chatter]

7
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:42,007
Sure, we're on tough
times here in Minden.

8
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,394
Tough times! That's right!

9
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,406
We are in such tough times I can say:

10
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,910
You know, I remember that song
<i>Things Aren't the Way They Used to Be.</i>

11
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:55,744
Well, ladies and gentlemen, things
aren't the way they used to be,

12
00:01:55,815 --> 00:02:00,184
and I got something to tell you. They
might never get back to where they were!

13
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,585
[song continues]

14
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:16,067
Ladies and gentlemen,
we don't need anything else but this.

[congregation murmurs]

16
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:23,037
Jesus gave us a brain.
He gave us a heart.

17
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,839
- [woman] Thank you, Lord!
- That's all you need.

18
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,075
So, if you concentrate

19
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,982
on what you don't have,

20
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,748
you forget about what
you do have. Hallelujah!

21
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,414
[congregation] Yeah!

down there, gotta look them twos, baby!

24
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,534
Whoo! Here they come! Bam!

- [players grunting]
- [whistle blows]

26
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,174
Team not lookin' that good this year.
Do they, Curtis?

27
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:01,441
Heck, they ain't looked
good in the last 25 years.

28
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,610
Damn! I ain't need no lemon!
Look at it, look it.

29
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,210
One more cherry,
I'd have won this thing.

30
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,257
Are we playing a game
here or what, man?

31
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:15,784
I'm playin'! You hold it up,
pick 'em up. Thank you.

32
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,389
That mean a double. Double trouble.
In the bubble. Here we go.

33
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,490
Pow! Look out there, double four!

34
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:22,830
Hey, Curtis!

35
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,835
Hey.

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,435
Man, you took your break
late today, huh?

37
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,103
Mm-mmm. Worked through it
so I can get to practice.

38
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,944
You know, if you want to help,
I can put in a word with coach.

39
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm busy. Got too much on my plate.

40
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,413
I wouldn't want to cut into all
that beer drinking and backgammon.

41

[chatter]

42
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,923
- Go long, let me see what you got.
- I don't have time, man. My first day.

43
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,930
Hey, why don't you come by this week
and get a real meal?

44
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,863
- Who's cookin'?
- Val.

45
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,360
- Take a rain check.
- That's wrong.

46
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,030
[coach] Do not hesitate!

47
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,131

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,343
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,475
Why are you always reading at lunch?

51
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,646
I mean, is this like the nerd table
or something?

52
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,384
J.K.

53
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,325
- You double Dutch?
- Yeah, sure.

54
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,455
Me and a few girls are meeting behind
the gym after school. You should come.

55
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:29,763
- Yeah, OK.
- OK. See you there.

56
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,102

- [car door closes]
- [engine starts]

60
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,069
- So how was school today?
- Fine.

[sighs]

62
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,342
Can you put that book down, please?

63
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:29,819
Sweetie, listen, I had to pick up
longer hours at the diner.

64
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,195
- I'm not gonna get home till late.
- So?

65
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,394
- I don't want you here alone.
- But I can take care of myself.

66
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,303
Honey, there are plenty of after-school
activities you could be doing.

67
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,568
- Like what?
- I don't know! Like drama.

68
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,375
Dance. Something.
Listen, I need for you to try.

69
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,210
Fine, I'll try.

70
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,943
[chatter]

71
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,617
Fashion?

72
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,257
About yesterday... I am really sorry.

73
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,267
I just got confused. I thought it
was yesterday, but we're going today.

74
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,533
So a bunch of us are hanging out
over there. You should come.

75
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,874
You comin'?

76
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,718
You crazy? I ain't tryin'
to think about that stuff.

77
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,278
- Yo, what's up?
- So, Jasmine,

78
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,588
we seem to have a little problem
with the girls' bathroom.

79
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,528
Uh, the toilets are clogged,
and since your name is Plummer and all,

80
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,796
we figured you'd
be the one to unclog them.

81
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,564
[all laughing]

82
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,772
Plumber girl,
hope there's no dookey in it.

83
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,467
- [bell rings]
- Ouch.

84
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,172
What a loser.

85
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,111
[water running]

86
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,443
[turns water off]

87
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,144
Everyone hates me.

88
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,912
They think I'm an idiot.
Can I just stay home, please?

89
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,154
Please, Ma? I can take care of myself.

90
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,034
- Claire, I ain't seen him. OK?
- [scoffs]

91
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,196
So if you lookin' for that
child support or whatever,

92
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,971
- he don't contact me no more either.
- This is not about your brother.

93
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,809
- It's about your niece, Jasmine.
- What's wrong with her?

94
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,906
Curtis, I need somebody
to hang out with her in the afternoon

95
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,884
- until I get my hours changed.
- I ain't no babysitter!

96
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,148
Come on, you've been out of work
for months.

97
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,249
I know you don't expect me to
walk around here with some little girl.

98
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,818
I don't even like kids
and you know that.

99
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:47,992
Well, find somebody else.

100
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,298
So, what, you just gonna
walk away from me, Curtis?

101
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,596
Huh?

102
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,906
When your mama didn't have no place
to go, remember who took care of her?

103
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,649
You playin' dirty pool, Claire.

104
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,182
Bring my mama in this,
that ain't even fair.

105
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,244
[sighs]

106
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,692
Curtis, listen, man, all I'm asking you
to do is to pick her up from school,

107
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,355
keep an eye on her.
Just until I get home.

108
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,160
It's just a few hours a day.

109
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,763
- I give you five dollars an hour?
- Five dollars?

110
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,176
Just pick her up
from the school at 3:00.

111
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,243
Curtis, I don't have nowhere else to go.

112
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,425
Hey, girl.

113
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,868
Hey!

114
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,205
Hey!

115
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,635
So you gonna talk to me or what?

116
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,202
What you readin', anyway?
What does it say?

117
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,681
<i>- "Ma-geeky"?</i>
- It's a book,

118
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,617
and it's not <i>"Ma-geeky",</i>
it's <i>Magique.</i>

119
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,280
It's about a boy who
becomes a magical warrior,

120
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:19,722
so, if you don't mind,
I'm trying to read.

121
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,022
Hey, don't be getting smart now.

122
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,689
I'm only doing this for your mama.
All right?

123
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,700
I don't take no lip
from no little girls neither.

124
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,795
- 'Cause I got better things to do.
- Then go do 'em.

125
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,334
Where you? Jasmine!

126
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,868
Hey! Hey, girl! Jasmine!

127
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,245
Ain't worth no damn five dollars!
Hey, Jasmine! Come here!

128
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,584
[snoring]

129
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,520
[keys jingle, door opens]

130
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,455
- [Claire] Hey!
- Hey.

131
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:03,260
- So how did it go?
- All right.

132
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,362
So where's Jas?

133
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,700
- I don't know.
- [door opens]

134
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,436
- Jas?
- Hey, Mom.

135
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,843
Hey! So, did you have fun
with your Uncle Curtis?

136
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,348
Tons. What's for dinner?

137
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,219
- You didn't eat yet?
- No.

138
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,655
You didn't feed her?

139
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,786
You told me to watch her. You
didn't say nothing about feeding her.

140
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,228
That's because I thought
you had common sense.

141
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,789
Get somebody with
some common sense, all right?

142
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,428
'Cause I ain't got enough to deal
with that little girl. OK?

143
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:43,999
Get somebody else 'cause, to be honest,
she too weird and moody for me.

144
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,239
Curtis, she's not weird. She's shy.

145
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,282
She's still waiting
on her no-good daddy to show up.

146
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,011
She's wearing his watch 24 hours a day.

147
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,951
It wouldn't hurt you if you would
just be a little encouraging to her.

148
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,959
I ain't got no encouragement. None!

149
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,290
Go get Dr. Phil
or the Dog Whisperer or somebody.

150
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,631
- Not Curtis Plummer.
- Can you finish out the week?

151
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,068
Can I at least get paid?

152
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,806
You owe me 25 dollars.

153
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,503
Can you at least
feed her the next time?

154
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,279
So, what you gonna want to eat? Hmm?

155
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,843
For dinner? What you like?

156
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,916
Grilled cheese sandwiches? Huh?

157
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,087
What, you still not talking to me?

158
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,366
Why do you want to talk to me?
I'm too weird and moody.

159
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,727
You know I didn't mean that.

160
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,800
All right, I don't think you're weird.

161
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,975
I said I'm sorry.

162
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,647
All right, fine, we ain't gotta talk.

163
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,088
Why you carry that stupid football
around all the time?

164
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,185
- I don't carry this all the time.
- Yeah, you do.

165
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,253
So?

166
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,427
So... you're a grown man
carrying around a football.

167
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,232
Don't you think that's weird?

168
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,970
Not really.

169
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,876
And you stink, too. Always wearing
those same old dirty clothes.

170
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,042
Don't you know how to do laundry?
You should be embarrassed.

171
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,383
I'm embarrassed to even be with you.

172
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:39,857
You know what? Five dollars a hour ain't
worth dealing with a attitude like that!

173
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,689
Then don't. It's not
like I want you around anyway.

174
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,893
- It's not like I want to be around!
- Don't be! I don't need you!

175
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,563
Apparently, you do need me.
That's what your mama think.

176
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,574
Now I'm stuck with you! That's
'cause your father didn't want to be.

177
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,219
Man... Sorry! God!

178
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,985
Hey, Jasmine,
I didn't mean it like that!

179
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,950
Hey, slow down!

180
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,513
- Who are you here for?
- Hmm?

181
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,280
Who are you here for?

182
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,322
- Jasmine Plummer.
- Oh, great! Come right on in.

183
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,998
OK, class.

184
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,861
I would like to...

185
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,632
I would like to introduce Mr. Plummer.

186
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,299
What are you doing?

187
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:06,208
Would you like to come up here
and tell the kids what you do?

188
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,874
Oh, wait a minute. Hold on.

189
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,511
- Um, I'm her uncle, not her daddy.
- Oh.

190
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,992
It's OK. Nuclear family,
extended family. It's all family.

191
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,621
So would you still like to talk
to the kids, tell them what you do?

192
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,531
- Yeah, I can talk to them.
- OK.

193
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,966
Hold that.

194
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,402
- [kids giggling]
- OK.

195
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,372
- How y'all doin'?
- [all] Fine.

196
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,840
Um...

197
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,470
I do all kinda, like,
entrepreneurial endeavors.

198
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,848
Um... You know those
nutritional supplements?

199
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,179
OK.

200
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,743
- Yeah, I used to sell those.
- [kids snickering]

201
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,655
And, um, you know, I had people
all over the world, really,

202
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,991
all kinds of geographical locations.
I had a salesmen who, um,

203
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,758
would participate in network marketing.

204
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,265
[boy] Don't listen to him.

205
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,733
He tried to get my dad
to sell those vitamins.

206
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,431
- He said it's a pyramid scheme.
- It's not a pyramid scheme!

207
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:11,272
It's a, uh, multilevel, uh,
business opportunity.

208
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,311
That's a scam!
You're a scam artist!

209
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,506
- Your daddy's a punk.
- You a punk!

210
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,847
OK, Javy. Mr. Plummer. Can we say thank
you to Mr. Plummer, please? Class!

211
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,648
[all] Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

212
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,713
Thank you so much, Mr. Plummer,
for taking out the time with the kids.

213
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,691
[Curtis] I'm gonna see you
outside, Jasmine.

214
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,126
OK. Yeah, let's just...

215
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,394
You need to give him a F.

216
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:40,166
- I'll see you outside too.
- Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

217
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,866
Thank you, Mr. Plummer.

218
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,910
[kids snickering, whispering]

219
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,981
Jasmine! Jasmine!

220
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,821
Know what? I'm gonna meet you
down the block next time.

221
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,264
I ain't going nowhere near that school.

222
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,802
I didn't tell you to come
in the first place.

223
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,771
You're using them big words,
trying to make yourself sound important.

224
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,903
Mr. Entrepreneur. How come you
couldn't just say you were unemployed?

225
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,241
Why you didn't tell 'em?

226
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,309
I don't think my mom'd be cool
with me hanging out here.

227
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:29,787
I know she not gonna want you here.
That's why you ain't gonna tell her.

228
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,050
Curtis! Throw the ball here, boy!

229
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,287
Do you mind if I throw the ball
with the reverend a little bit?

230
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,053
Ah!

231
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,762
Knock yourself out.

232
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,236
So when am I gonna see
you back in church, boy?

233
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,762
I don't know, reverend.
I've been kinda preoccupied lately.

234
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,605
Preoccupied since your mama died.

235
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,135
It's been two years, Curtis.

236
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,614
It is time to move on, son.

237
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,481
Hey. Go long, brotha.

238
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,385
All right. Hit me.

239
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,820
Hit me, hit...

240
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,484
Oops.

241
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,927
Hey, girl.

242
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,524
Jasmine!

243
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,637
Jasmine, pick up that ball.

244
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,985
You ever play sports in school?

245
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,827
No, I don't like sports.

246
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,862
What do you mean,
you don't like sports?

247
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,771
- I want to be a model.
- A model?

248
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,866
[laughs]

249
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:02,346
For real? You don't even
look like the model type.

250
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,180
- What, I'm ugly?
- No.

251
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,549
I didn't say you was ugly, did I?

252
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,680
Just you always got your nose
in a book or something.

253
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,523
I thought you wanted to be something
a little more intellectual.

254
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,529
<i>Next makeover candidate</i>
<i>deserves to feel like a queen.</i>

255
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,556
So you ain't never
threw the football before today?

256
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,593
No, now leave me alone.
I'm trying to watch <i>Tyra.</i>

257
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,540
It's hard to believe, though.
You throw pretty good.

258
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,311
Shh!

259
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,438
<i>Here is what Francesca looks like.</i>
<i>Come on out, goddess!</i>

260
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,416
[Curtis] Is this a <i>Tyra</i> marathon
or somethin'?

261
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,683
You know, might as well just go on
outside and throw the football around

262
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:48,089
- a little before your mama come back.
- Shh!

263
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,028
All right. I'm shhh, shhh, shhh.

264
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,696
- You're not gonna shut up, are you?
- Nope.

265
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,935
Here we go! Here we go!
Here we go, go, go! Come on.

266
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,342
Hey, you kinda slow.

267
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,605
You gotta put a little pep in that.

268
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,082
Right here you go, hit me with your
best shot. Come on, girl. Right here!

269
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,082
Right here.

270
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,047
No!

271
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:24,360
Throw it like you did at the park.
With a little more oomph on it.

272
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,522
Right here.

273
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,595
Ha!

274
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,967
That was better.

275
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,665
But look, when you throw the ball,

276
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,538
first of all,
you got to have your feet apart.

277
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,633
What are you doing?

278
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,111
Look, you cannot stand like this
and throw the ball.

279
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,548
You have to be sideways,
point it, deliver.

280
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,175
You really stink.

281
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,317
- Do you know what a down and out is?
- You.

282
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,528
Funny.

283
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,120
Go ten spaces... bam.

284
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:04,101
Go out, hit me with the ball before I
turn out. Right in the hands. All right?

285
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,295
Come on, call it out.

286
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,134
- What?
- Let's go!

287
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,175
Gotta call it out.

288
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:14,508
"Hut, hut, hike." You know, like
quarterbacks do. Come on, hit me.

289
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,980
- Hut, hut, hike.
- Better than that.

290
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,415
- Hut, hut, hike!
- There we go. Come on!

291
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,713
Hit me! Hit me!

292
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,281
Ooh!

293
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,119
- Yeah!
- [door creaks]

294
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,455
Hey, Jasmine!

295
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,969
"The family was important
in New England.

296
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,939
Puritan children, like their parents,
had to work hard

297
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,340
and follow strict ideas of discipline.

298
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,092
Still, many families were close
and devoted to each other.

299
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,028
Even the chores and religious duties..."

300
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,969
You like throwing the football?

301
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,734
Yeah, it's cool.

302
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,005
Want to learn how to throw
like a real quarterback?

303
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,138
- [whistle blows]
- Sure.

304
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,744
First thing I'm gonna do
is show you how to grip this football.

305
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,721
See these laces here?
You gotta get your fingers on them.

306
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,850
That gives the ball the spiral.
That makes it spin.

307
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,354
All right, you grab it. Find your grip.

308
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,831
Give it to me.

309
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,392
- That's how fast you gotta get.
- OK, throw it to me.

310
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,459
Now, you grab it.

311
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,330
- Got it?
- Got it.

312
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,737
- Like it?
- Like it.

313
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,799
That's how you hold the ball.
That's your grip.

314
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,073
Mr. Peppers, you got any
of that field paint around here?

315
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:31,081
Yeah, I think there's some
in that back room there.

316
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,279
- Look under the dresser.
- Oh. Ah.

317
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,685
Got it. Thanks,
I'll bring it right back.

318
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:46,226
OK. Those your lines right here. I want
you to keep your foot in here, right?

319
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,756
See where my foot is starting?
Step out, bam, put it back.

320
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:52,895
Step out, bam, put it back.
Step out, bam, put it back.

321
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,302
Bam, put it back.

322
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,603
Good. Pretty good, you'll get better,
you'll get better.

323
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,768
Let's go throw some passes.

324
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,937
Step into it.

325
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,678
Give it to me. Deliver the ball.

326
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:10,211
Come on, deliver right here, to my
hands. Not here, not there, right here.

327
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,655
Step into it, remember
everything I told you, deliver.

328
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,227
Damn, girl!

329
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,126
Girl, you got a arm on you.

330
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,438
Can't we just toss it around
like we did yesterday?

331
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,274
No! That's boring.

332
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,974
- [sighs]
- Look, you wanna be a quarterback,

333
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,516
you gotta learn how
to hit multiple receivers.

334
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,315
Right here,
receiver number one: Beyoncé.

335
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:48,052
Over here, receiver number two:
Foxy Brown.

336
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:53,029
And my personal favorite,
receiver number three: Tyra Banks.

337
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,896
Don't forget
what I told you, set your feet.

338
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,425
Do it like we said, all right? Ready?

339
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,803
- Ready.
- OK. Load up. Load up.

340
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,705
Hit Beyoncé.

341
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,535
Bam!

342
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:10,248
That's what I'm talkin' about.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

343
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,284
All right, one more time.
Here we go. One more time. Come on.

344
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,342
Load up, load up.
Get ready, get ready.

345
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,285
Foxy Brown, hit her, hit her.

346
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,957
- Ouch!
- Whoo! Whoo!

347
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,359
- Man, right on.
- That girl's a phenom!

348
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,229
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Come on, load up, load up, load up.

349
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,666
Tyra. Hit her! Hit her.

350
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,795
- [gasps]
- [cheering]

351
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,430
Slayed that thing, girl!

352
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,441
I'm gonna go out for a pass, all right?

353
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:40,103
You gotta learn how
to hit a moving target, OK?

354
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,238
You ready to hit me now, all right?
Gotta go!

355
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,983
Beyoncé!

356
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,215
Whoo! Yeah!

357
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:52,915
That was sweet!

358
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,687
Curtis got himself
a pro player out there now!

359
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,197
That girl throw that ball! That's what
I'm talkin' about now, that's football.

360
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,961
- That's football!
- [Curtis] You're good, girl!

361
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,197
You might be my niece after all.

362
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,898
So how have things
with Curtis and Jas been going?

363
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,239
Everything seems OK. I think they just
sit around and read books.

364
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,244
[both belch]

365
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:25,587
Man! I can't believe you live
in this place. It's so messy.

366
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:35,355
Is that my book? Man, I been
lookin' all over for this thing.

367
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,298
What's it doin' here?

368
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:43,205
- Have you been reading this?
- Yeah.

369
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,612
I saw how much you was into it,
so I just gave it a shot.

370
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,018
- And?
- It's good. I like it.

371
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:57,915
It's a good book.

372
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,254
Well, I read it two times.
You can have it.

373
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,656
Is this your yearbook?

374
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,859
Mm-hmm.

375
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,467
Don't laugh.

376
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,334
[Jasmine laughs]

377
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,607
Is this you?
Man, you look so funny.

378
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,851
That's me,
and then that's your daddy.

379
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,122
All right, let's just close that.

380
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,589
I'll show you later.

381
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,329
[exhales]

382
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,098
I should be getting you home.

383
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,132
OK.

384
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,010
No! No, you don't throw the ball!

385
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,539
It's an option play, right?
Option means you keep the ball

386
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,951
or you run with the ball
or you pitch the ball.

387
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,149
The man's shoulders are up-field,
what do you do?

388
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,556
Yes, go, do it again!

389
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,926
- Honest to God!
- [boy] Hut, hut!

390
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,397
- [whistle blows]
- [boys grunting]

391
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,527
This is where you're supposed to pitch
the football! What is hard about that?

392
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:22,733
You know what, guys? I would like
to win one football game, just one!

393
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,605
But we can't win a game
if we can't pitch a football!

394
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,373
- No way!
- Why not?

395
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:32,849
'Cause I'm a girl,
and girls don't play football.

396
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:37,513
What you think we been doing for
the last couple of weeks, crocheting?

397
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,855
It's just you and me having fun
so we don't die of boredom.

398
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,555
It doesn't mean I want to try out
for some stupid football team.

399
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,723
But you're good at it.

400
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,758
Right? Now, you owe it to yourself if
you're good at something to pursue it.

401
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,908
Let me show you somethin'.
Come on, let me show you somethin'.

402
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,110
These my conference MVP medals,

403
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,709
three years in a row.

404
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,152
These are cool.

405
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:18,389
Just picture a whole stadium
full of people cheering for you.

406
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,765
I just think it would be weird playing
football with a bunch of boys.

407
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,771
Look at Oprah...
being all rich and powerful.

408
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,807
You think she care about
the fact that she's not a guy?

409
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,106
But...

410
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,909
...I can't play football and be a model.

411
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,542
Yes, you can. I mean, look, Tyra Banks.

412
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,954
She's a model, talk-show host...

413
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,018
She even did a album.

414
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:51,324
Can't even sing, but she did it anyway.

415
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:55,093
I mean, you can do what you want to do.
I'll make you a deal.

416
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:02,503
Try out for the team,
just to see how you like it...

417
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,476
...and I'll buy you some more
of those fashion magazines you like.

418
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,608
How about this:

419
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:17,519
If I go out for the football team,

420
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,786
you ask Ms. Macer out on a date.

421
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,690
Your teacher?

422
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:27,164
I saw the way she looked
at you in the classroom.

423
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,257
All right.

424
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,165
All right, I'll ask her.

425
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,134
But when you try out for the team,

426
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:39,040
all this "I'm a girl" stuff,
you throw that out the window.

427
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,704
'Cause when you hit the field,
you're not a girl.

428
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,272
You're a football player.

429
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,778
[coach] Huddle it up, let's go!

430
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:52,118
[boy] All right, come on, huddle it up!
Come on, no playing around, hurry up!

431
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,317
- [boy 2] Blue 22, blue 22!
- [boy] Go long!

432
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,156
- Hut, hut!
- [all groaning]

433
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,391
Chrissakes, Feather, you're
not hikin' the ball to Yao Ming!

434
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,400
- Sorry.
- Turn around, let's go!

435
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,904
I think this team
is worse than last year's team.

436
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,031
We only won two games last year.

437
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,973
Hey, coach.

438
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,245
Curtis Plummer. Been a while.

439
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,407
- How's the team?
- Ah, not quite there yet.

440
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,544
What she supposed to be doin' here?
She tryin' out for cheerleader?

441
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,020
Yo, dookey girl!

442
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,085
I might have somethin'
that'll help get you there.

443
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,290
I wish.
You're a little too old, Curtis.

444
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:38,199
Not me, my niece. Jasmine, step up.

445
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

446
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,002
She's a girl. This is a boys' league.

447
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,203
- Says who?
- Says everybody.

448
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,476
- What position does she play?
- She's a quarterback.

449
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,246
- She's a quarterback?
- We got a quarterback.

450
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,651
Javy Hall.

451
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,088
Come on!

452
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,026
What the hell?!
Are you kidding me?

453
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,660
He's pretty talented.

454
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,158
[clears throat] Curtis.

455
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,029
You know what? He's getting better.

456
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,936
You want to let your niece get
all busted up 'cause what?

457
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,412
You want to relive your glory days?

458
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,608
Come on, Curtis.

459
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,844
I got a team to coach.

460
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,512
Do it again!

461
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,289
Jasmine.

462
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:38,788
- Where you goin'?
- I told you they wouldn't want me.

463
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,760
They gonna want you.

464
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:47,100
What I want you to do is give me
a three-step drop and hit me with it.

465
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,731
Come on, three-step drop, come on.

466
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,275
Go! Go.

467
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,488
You gotta be kidding me!
Get the ball in your hands...

468
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,525
All right, here we go, they lookin'.

469
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,687
[coach] Guys, it's a simple pass play!
OK, line it up.

470
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,128
Whoo!

471
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,266
Coach.

472
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,407
[Curtis] That's sweet!

473
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,443
Hmm.

474
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,183
All right, Manny, right side, let's go.

475
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,249
OK, we're gonna run a ten and in,
all right?

476
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,856
Relax, stay loose.

477
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,866
- Three-step drop. Deliver the ball.
- [coach] OK, let's do this.

478
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,162
What's your problem?

479
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:53,897
I'm not letting her put
hands under my King Kongs.

480
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,566
- Your what?
- My King Kongs, the magic?

481
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,269
- She's not touchin' it.
- You mean Ping-Pongs?

482
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,006
Stop cryin' and hike the damn ball!
Let's go!

483
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,547
Hut, hut!

484
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,009
[all laughing]

485
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,211
[whistle blows]

486
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,583
[coach] Hey! Hey!

487
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,281
- That's OK, Jasmine.
- Zip it!

488
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,154
- Do it again.
- Secure the ball, OK?

489
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,126
Secure the ball.

490
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,890
Comfortable.

491
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,590
Hut, hut!

492
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,034
Someone's been teachin'
somebody some football.

493
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:32,636
Good job!

494
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,573
Let's do a buttonhook.

495
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,308
Beyoncé, buttonhook.

496
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,809
Hut, hut!

497
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,655
Who's laughing now?

498
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,234
- [coach] Go again. Let's go long.
- Hut, hut!

499
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,013
Very nice. All right, that's enough.

500
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,986
Let's go, guys, suit up, let's go.

501
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,590
She's got an arm, no question.

502
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:25,226
- Ball handling's kinda weak.
- I'll work with her.

503
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:29,357
She'll be better
than half the guys out here.

504
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,265
All right.

505
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,600
Thanks, coach, I appreciate it.
I know you didn't have to do that.

506
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You made it.

507
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,707
You on the team.

508
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,337
You on the team!

509
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,474
What I tell you?
I knew you could do it.

510
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,783
- Curtis, are you crazy?
- But, Mom, I am pretty good,

511
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:54,188
and you did say you wanted me
to do some after-school activity.

512
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,658
You said something
about after school!

513
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,321
Honey, are you serious?

514
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,024
Do you really want to do this?

515
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,092
Don't you think
I should at least... try?

516
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,302
<i>- [Javy] # Yeah, come on, y'all</i>
<i>- [boy] # Yeah</i>

517
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,843
# <i>Bring it, bring it</i>
<i>Bring it down now</i>

518
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,104
[boy 2] Whoo!

519
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,377
<i>[Javy]</i> # <i>Come on, yeah</i>

520
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,744
# <i>Pick it up</i>

521
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,716
<i>- [boy 3] # Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>- [Javy] # Come on</i>

522
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,349
<i>- [boy 4]</i> # <i>Here we go</i>
<i>- [Javy]</i> # <i>Yeah</i>

523
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,753
# <i>All right, all right</i>
<i>Yeah, I like that</i> #

524
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,557
- You nervous?
- No, I'm all right.

525
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,790
[boys chanting]

526
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,355
Go in here.

527
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,897
Let's go.

528
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,172
OK.

529
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,441
Let's see... get this.

530
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,539
Uh...

531
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,387
There, that's good. There you go.

532
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,950
- Be all right?
- Mmm... yeah.

533
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:06,292
- OK. Uh, get your jersey.
- Coach...

534
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,556
Um...

535
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,327
Can I have number 11?

536
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,272
I'll have a look.

537
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,742
[grunts]

538
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,817
[grunts]

539
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,691
[grunts]

540
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,300
Come on. Whoo!

541
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,497
Eww!

542
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,773
OK.

543
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,100
Oh! Oh-oh!

544
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:22,205
Lookin' good there.
Don't jinx my old number now.

545
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:24,764
Come on, hustle up, let's go.

546
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,242
[Javy] Blue 42, hut, hut!

547
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,709
[boy] Pass, pass.

548
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,279
[boy 2] Damon!

549
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,377
Gotta put that in his hands.

550
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,015
C, man, why don't you
come down here and join us?

551
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,322
I'm cool. When's Jasmine
gonna get some practice time?

552
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,362
Yeah! What you scared of?

553
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,398
She gonna make your boys
look like a bunch of pansies?

554
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,724
Dive, dive!

555
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,793
- Ha! Too late for that.
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,668
I'll do my best.

557
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,369
One more time.

558
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,737
Curtis is...

559
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,040
Watch the blitz!

560
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,378
- Go, come on.
- Go to line.

561
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,746
Cover two.

562
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,547
- Coach!
- Move. Game two.

563
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,617
Javy! Bring it in.

564
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,593
Come on! Hustle up!

565
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,789
- [whistle blows]
- All right.

566
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,828
Let the backup run a few plays.

567
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,599
Plummer.

568
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,642
You'll run a double-twin,
wide triangle.

569
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:37,613
Basically, you look for Damon
over the middle. Ten yards. OK?

570
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:41,743
He's gonna cut down the middle. Go.
Hustle, get in there. Take control.

571
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,324
OK, so we're gonna go to double-twins,
wide-end triangle. Got it?

572
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,225
- This is a joke.
- No way.

573
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,730
Ready? Break.

574
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,859
- [chatter]
- Shh! Shh!

575
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,335
[boy] Watch the ends!

576
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:07,071
Brown 19! Brown 19!

577
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,202
Hut, hut!

578
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:11,709
[Jasmine groans]

579
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:12,976
- [whistle blows]
- Oh!

580
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,315
Ooh! She's not much
of a scrambler, is she?

581
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,150
That's all right, Jasmine!
Shake it off!

582
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,522
[boy] This is a man's game, baby!

583
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,821
Ooh! Her mama would of saw that hit...

584
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,194
Ooh, ooh.

585
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:31,227
- Welcome to football.
- Back it up!

586
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,932
Red 37! Red 37! Hut, hut!

587
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,173
- [groans]
- [whistle blows]

588
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,237
Hey!

589
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,675
Hey. They're doing it on purpose.

590
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,221
Ain't even blockin'!

591
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,059
This time I'm gonna knock her
outta her training bra.

592
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,368
Red 19! Red 19! Hut, hut!

593
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,642
- [groans]
- [whistle blows]

594
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,580
She ain't the only girl
on the team now.

595
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,207
[groaning]

596
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,657
That's right! They'll block now!
I wish I'd have thought of that.

597
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,788
- Medic?
- Man.

598
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,691
[Macer] Good night, Ray.

599
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,569
- Ms. Macer.
- Oh! Oh.

600
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,234
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
Uh...

601
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:49,643
I left something in there for Jasmine.
I was coming to pick it up.

602
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:53,581
- Um, we just locked up.
- Oh, OK.

603
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:57,052
- All right, I guess I'll get it later.
- OK.

604
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,683
- So I mean, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

605
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,693
You like football?

606
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:07,663
As in watching or...
[laughs] or playing?

607
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:11,895
As in watching.
Actually, watching Jasmine.

608
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,437
- Your niece plays football?
- Yeah.

609
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:19,101
She's the back-up quarterback for the
Minden Browns. First game's on Saturday.

610
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,304
How'd your niece
end up playing football?

611
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,472
It kinda runs in the family.

612
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,175
Yeah.

613
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,617
- So do you like football?
- Um...

614
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:36,049
- I like football.
- Cool.

615
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,890
- I could pick you up at noon.
- Wait. [stammers] Hold on.

616
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:42,194
Um, so... so are you askin' me,
like... like, on a date?

617
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,302
Well, I mean, it's kinda like... Yeah.

618
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:52,741
I mean, we could just go hang out,
talk, figure out what's what.

619
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,177
But I'd like for it to be a date.

620
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,614
I... I guess I wouldn't mind.

621
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,449
Oh, yeah? Cool.

622
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,922
Last drill of the day.

623
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,084
I call this my grilled cheese special.

624
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,855
Why is it called
the grilled cheese special?

625
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,194
Because if you knock down
all three of those cans,

626
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,258
I'll buy you grilled cheese
and I won't cook dinner.

627
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,462
Hallelujah. Let's do it.

628
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,543
Yeah! Yeah, one for one.

629
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,101
Let's see what you got.

630
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,168
Come on.

631
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:35,413
Pretty good. This time, I want you
to throw it through the can.

632
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:40,517
- Not at the can, through the can.
- OK.

633
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,258
Too high!

634
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,296
- You know those people?
- No.

635
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,336
- Think they know your face?
- No.

636
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,565
Come on, come on, come on!

637
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,335
Right here.

638
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,980
Aren't those dirty?

639
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,279
I mean, this one right here,

640
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:11,344
I know I can get... two more days
out of that one.

641
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,956
She's my teacher, Uncle Curtis.

642
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,925
Wear something nice.

643
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,994
It's just barbecue sauce.

644
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,863
And when you're with her today,

645
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,664
- don't try so hard.
- What you mean?

646
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,708
I mean, tell her she looks nice and...

647
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,404
Listen to what she has to say.

648
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,148
[coach] All right, defensive back,
over here, let's go.

649
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,152
- Thought there'd be more people.
- For a Pop Warner game?

650
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,915
People will start coming.

651
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:49,358
Back in the day,
we used to have this place rockin'.

652
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,257
Hi.

653
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,228
What up, Curt?

654
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,600
Time to tape your wrists up, Jasmine.

655
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:03,305
- Ditch this watch.
- Tape over it.

656
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:06,002
- What?
- Tape over it.

657
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,405
OK.

658
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,316
You look nice.

659
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,552
Thank you. And so do you.

660
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:25,288
- It's my favorite hat.
- [man] It's his only hat.

661
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,626
- [Javy] Hut, hut!
- [cheerleaders chant]

662
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,598
Run, run!

663
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,263
- [all grunt]
- [whistle blows]

664
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,235
Come on, Fisher,
mix it up a little bit!

665
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,774
Spread 'em out!

666
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,969
Come on, coach!

667
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,503
Come on, man, play Jasmine!

668
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,572
Fisher! Number 11!

669
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,278
Play Jasmine!

670
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,280
Play number 11!

671
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,453
Come on, man, play Jasmine.

672
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,671
[Jasmine] This is a total waste of time
if I don't even get to play.

673
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,902
When is it gonna be my time?

674
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:17,310
Probably when it's so bad,
they gotta use you.

675
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,246
Hold up. Wait a minute.

676
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,942
Remember when this factory was open?

677
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,715
- Remember that?
- No, not really.

678
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,050
Uh-uh.

679
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:31,220
Oh, man! It was a whole
different vibe around here.

680
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,636
- Come on.
- [cheerleaders] Be aggressive!

681
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:44,765
- [cheerleaders continue]
- [shouting]

682
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,367
Set and hut!

683
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:50,504
[cheerleaders] B-E aggressive!
B-E aggressive!

684
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,709
- B-E aggressive! Spell it!
- [whistle blows]

685
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,809
Yes! Whoo!

686
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,612
[man] Good block! Just like that!

687
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,493
Man, if this is a fight, they'd have
stopped this. We lost this, man.

688
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:10,923
It's all right! Come on, let's go!
Have we completed a pass today?

689
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,462
Hut, hut!

690
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,334
- Please, God.
- [Curtis] Coach!

691
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,731
Coach Fisher!

692
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,466
Jerry!

693
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:26,475
- Let Jasmine play.
- Go back to your seat, Curtis.

694
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,644
Come on, coach. Let her play.

695
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,347
Give her a shot.

696
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:34,686
She don't score, you won't hear from me.
I won't say nothing.

697
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:40,191
I swear! Aren't you sick of me yelling?
Put Jasmine in! Put Jasmine in!

698
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,856
Put her in!

699
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,194
- Time!
- [whistle blows]

700
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,965
Javy!

701
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,933
Plummer!

702
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,808
Plummer! Let's go, you're in!

703
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,672
Come on, let's go!
Get that helmet on. Hustle up!

704
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,238
- Yeah!
- OK.

705
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,546
- It's about time!
- Yes!

706
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:05,577
- Shotgun 50-wide motion. Let's go.
- All right. I got it.

707
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:10,286
That's right. That's right, Jasmine!
Let's go! Come on, girl!

708
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,294
Oh, my God!

709
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,455
Hey, you guys, check this out.

710
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,295
- They got a girl playin' quarterback.
- [boys snicker]

711
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,598
Wait, wait, no. I'm confused.
I thought they already had a girl.

712
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,968
[laughter continues]

713
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:25,907
All right, you guys. We're gonna do
a shotgun 50 wide-motion. Got it?

714
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,637
Oh, yeah. That's gonna work.

715
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,275
Check scoreboards, Manny. Wanna keep
running what we've been running?

716
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:38,853
Yeah, that's what I thought. All right,
you guys. Shotgun 50, wide-motion flag.

717
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,516
- You got it? Ready.
- Break!

718
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,827
[boy] All right. Here we go.

719
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,594
- [boy 2] Go.
- [boy 3] Let's go guys.

720
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:53,466
- [boy 4] Got a lady on the field!
- [boy 5] We got several of those!

721
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,732
- [boy 6] I got him!
- Come on.

722
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,940
- Hut, hut!
- Come on, baby.

723
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,136
Hut, hut!

724
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,605
[players shouting]

725
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,452
[boy 7] Pass, pass, pass.

726
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,154
Hit Beyoncé! Hit Beyoncé!

727
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,026
[boy 8] Eighty-one!

728
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,532
[cheering]

729
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,198
- Yeah!
- We did it! We did it!

730
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,674
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

731
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,904
- Yes! Yes!
- [crowd cheering, whistling]

732
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,341
[Curtis] That was sweet!

733
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,812
Huh? Huh?

734
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,650
That's what I'm saying.

735
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,058
- Good going, Jasmine!
- Jasmine! That was sweet!

736
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,336
Way to go, Jazzmatazz!

737
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:07,241
If you actually played the whole game,
we'd probably have won.

738
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,074
- Thanks.
- That was a good game.

739
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,347
What up? Come check us out.
Support the team.

740
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:22,324
Hands release. I want that going
through your mind every snap.

741
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:25,327
Elbow up, drive through the ball. Yeah.

742
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,989
Hey, hey!

743
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,060
Come check out my niece play football.

744
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,729
Young phenom playing quarterback.

745
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:39,435
- This football with a round ball?
- No, this is the real football.

746
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,444
Real football with helmets.
Come on Saturday.

747
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:43,911
Drive, drive, drive.

748
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,814
OK. Drive, drive, drive it!
Pull it, pull it!

749
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,251
Ball up. Down.

750
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,686
When that ball come up,
are you ready to fire?

751
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:56,317
- I'm ready.
- Like a gun cocking back.

752
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,329
Ready to shoot. Ball up.
Ready to fire.

753
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,026
Down. Three things a quarterback
need to remember?

754
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,535
Feet, hands, release.

755
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,401
Ball up. Down.

756
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:14,199
- Ball up. Ready to fire.
- I'm ready to fire.

757
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,767
You look like a quarterback.

758
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,747
- [indistinct chatter]
- [whistle blows]

759
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,812
She cannot lose her first start.

760
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,913
Tiger left, X special. OK?
You can do this! Get in there!

761
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,892
Where I come from, football is played
with a round ball and feet.

762
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,988
Tiger left-end special!
Tiger the left-end special!

763
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,226
Let's go, Browns! Let's go!

764
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,726
Blue 32! Blue 32!

765
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:41,828
- Come on.

766
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,301
[players shouting]

767
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,772
[crowd chattering excitedly]

768
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,238
[man] Go, go, go!

769
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,548
[crowd cheering]

770
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:58,019
[all groan]

771
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,450
- Goal!
- Yes!

772
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,118
Goal!

773
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,526
- Goal!
- It's touchdown, man! Touchdown!

774
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,689
- Touchdown!
- Touchdown!

775
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,323
[crowd shouting, cheering]

776
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,868
That's what I'm talking about!

777
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:16,201
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah. Come on!

778
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:18,366
- That's what I'm talkin'...
- Come on.

779
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:30,714
I did it! I did it! I'm a quarterback!
I'm a quarterback!

780
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,516
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

781
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,080
[humming]

782
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:42,926
[all grunt]

783
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:45,425
[all grunt]

784
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,808
[squeals]

785
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,012
Sorry.

786
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,984
Let's go!

787
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,721
[all cheering]

788
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,755
[man] Ya'll looking good!

789
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:24,173
[crowd chants] Plummer, Plummer,

790
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:25,606
Come on, girl!

791
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,509
Let's go! Let's go!

792
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,605
[cheerleaders] Let's go Thunderbolts!

793
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,173

794
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,677
- [grunts]

795
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:38,778
[all gasp]

796
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,624
What's wrong?
Got a little dirt in your skirt?

797
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:44,922
- Back off!
- [crowd boos]

798
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,694
- Come on, get up. kid.
- You OK?

799
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,890
Let's go.

800
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,227
She all right.

801
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,401
That's right, good job! Good job!

802
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,837
Blue 52! Hut, hut!

803
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:09,875
[shouting]

804
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,449
Yeah, yeah!

805
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,658
Yeah! Whoo!

806
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,329
[all shout]

807
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:29,063
What's the matter?
Got a little dirt in your skirt?

808
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,733
Ten, nine, eight,

809
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,368
seven, six, five

810
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,572
four, three, two, one!

811
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:52,793
Yeah! Yeah! We did it! We did it!

812
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,420
Yeah!

813
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:58,694
When you juked that linebacker,
I don't know what that man saw first,

814
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:02,067
the turf or Feather's ass
when he sat on the man!

815
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,638
Hey. Congrats on the game, guys.

816
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:12,279
- What's she doing here?
- What do you think? Part of the team.

817
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,817
I wouldn't be caught dead
playing football.

818
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,409
If you were playing football,
you would be dead!

819
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:22,080
- Six feet under, baby!
- Yeah, right.

820
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:25,559
Whatever. Just don't let me
catch you in the girls room again.

821
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:27,597
OK, Jaz-man?

822
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,525
Let's go.

823
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,558
Attitude.

824
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,297
They're just jealous.

825
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:41,676
Yep. This is it.

826
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:46,876
This curb right here did to me
what no defense in the state could do.

827
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,011
Tore my ACL,
ripped every ligament in my knee.

828
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,988
- What did you do?
- [scoffs]

829
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,756
Got a job at the factory.

830
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,526
Once that closed down,

831
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,000
out of work, like everybody else.

832
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:09,831
Why didn't you leave?

833
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,508
I should have left.

834
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,406
I ended up getting stuck.

835
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,480
<i>You know, the history of sports</i>
<i>is really a history of firsts.</i>

836
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,749
<i>The first pitcher</i>
<i>to pitch a perfect game.</i>

837
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,485
<i>The first NFL team to go undefeated.</i>

838
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,791
<i>And now the first female quarterback.</i>
<i>Impossible, you say?</i>

839
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,355
<i>- You haven't met Jasmine Plummer.</i>
- Hey.

840
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:41,200
- They're talking about Jasmine.
<i>...to five straight victories.</i>

841
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:45,571
Nobody's prouder
of this football team than I am.

842
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:49,100
But pride doesn't win football games.

843
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,239
Hard work wins football games.

844
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,181
Individuals have stepped up: Jasmine,

845
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,915
Feather, Manny.

846
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,615
Individuals.

847
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:09,654
But individuals don't win football
games. Team wins football games.

848
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,928
We've got two games left to play
to make the post-season.

849
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:17,768
- What wins football games?
- Hard work!

850
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,367
- What wins football games?
- Team!

851
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,611
- What wins football games?
- Hard work!

852
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,014
- What wins football games?!
- Team!

853
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:30,746
- What wins football games?!
- Team!

854
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,809
Bring it in!

855
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,620
Browns on three! One, two, three!

856
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,095
[team] Browns!

857
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,468
- Special teams.
- You got it.

858
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,743
[exhales]

859
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,516
Coach!

860
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,021
Dad!

861
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,969
[sighs]

862
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:32,208
- Hi.
- Hi.

863
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:37,919
- How's coach?
- He's doing OK.

864
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:42,583
But doc says too much stress, you know.

865
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,619
So no more football for now.

866
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,890
Oh.

867
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,334
Hmm.

868
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:58,136
Look, Jerry asked me
to coach the team.

869
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:01,771
That's cool.

870
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,014
Curtis, I can't do this alone, man.

871
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,879
Sorry.

872
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,888
I just think
I'm better off in the stands.

873
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,925
I ain't been on the field, man,
since... since I played.

874
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,428
Come on, Curtis.

875
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,691
Look at what you've done with Jasmine.

876
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,264
I know. That's just one girl, though.
It's not a whole team.

877
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:32,371
I just seriously think I'm
the wrong guy for the job.

878
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,239
All right.

879
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,011
Well, we play Harvey in three days.

880
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,950
And they're still
the best in the league.

881
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,795
You know I'll be there.

882
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,524
Right there in the stands,
rooting you on.

883
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,337
What you running from?

884
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:46,179
- I ain't running.
- I know a runner when I see one.

885
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,118
You're too young
to be feelin' sorry for yourself.

886
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:54,315
And too old to be this damn stupid.

887
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,359
You need to get yourself
out this park, boy.

888
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:00,529
Go.

889
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:19,173
[coach] Come on, now! We're in the
playoffs now. You better act like it!

890
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,237
Do I look like?

891
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,808
All right. Everybody listen up!
Heads up!

892
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:27,216
Coach Fisher's gonna be all right.

893
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,258
And so are we.

894
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,886
He wants us to win on Saturday,
and that's what we gonna do.

895
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,393
Looks like I'm gonna need a whistle
before the day's over.

896
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,993
Well...

897
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,662
I'll see if I can dig one up.

898
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:48,370
And stay down! Stay down.
Stop. Roll! Roll! Let me see!

899
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:49,502
Roll, baby!

900
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:54,016
Receiver should never
have false starts. Ever. Ever.

901
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:57,018
You gotta keep your eye on the ball.

902
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,316
Ready? Hut! Hut!

903
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:08,295
The game is won right here.
Line of scrimmage.

904
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:13,324
Give it to him, and you fake to him.
Keep your eye on him.

905
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:18,906
- Coach.
- Yeah?

906
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,136
I think you're gonna need
one of these.

907
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,235
- [chuckles]
- [team applauds]

908
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,109
Looks good, huh?

909
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:31,952
Are you serious?
Sometimes, you face opponents

910
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,683
that's bigger and stronger than us.

911
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:38,454
It's like facing a brick wall. Believe
you can run through a brick wall?

912
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,018
- [all] Yes, sir!
- Let me hear you say,

913
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,723
- "I believe!"
- [all] I believe!

914
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:43,163
- I believe!
- I believe!

915
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,223
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

916
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,098
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

917
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,070
- What we do?
- [all] We get down!

918
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,436
- What we do?
- [all] We get down!

919
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,138
Yeah! Yeah!

920
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,871
That's what I'm talking about.

921
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,138
- You love us.
- That's our team!

922
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,116
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

923
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,016
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

924
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,681
- What do we do?
- [all] We get down!

925
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:07,745
Yeah! Take me home!

926
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:12,352
If we're not committed to blocking
and tackling, not committed to winning.

927
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,654
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

928
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,860
- Who are we?
- [all] Minden Browns!

929
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,903
- What do we do?
- [all] We get down!

930
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:22,870
- What do we do?
- [all] We get down!

931
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,964
This is it.
We got time for one play.

932
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:28,169
- Y'all remember we practiced on Friday?
- [all agree]

933
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,576
OK, Feather, it's on you. All right?

934
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,841
Run it. Run it to perfection. Let's go.

935
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,383
Stay on your feet!
Stay on your feet!

936
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:38,453
- Strong right!
- Let's go, team!

937
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,525
Watch the back!

938
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,463
Motion!

939
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,839
Shift, shift!

940
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,037
Blue 32! Blue 32!

941
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,101
Hut, hut!

942
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:07,345
[players shouting]

943
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:14,720
Sweep! Sweep!

944
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,322
Not the Rooskie.

945
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:23,456
- The Roo... They got the...
- [man] Fumblerooskie! Take it home!

946
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,762
[cheering, shouting]

947
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:34,906
Rooskie! They ran the Rooskie!
The Rooskie!

948
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:39,544
Whoo!

949
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,178
- Touchdown!
- Playoffs!

950
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:49,782
- What's a Fumblerooskie?
- Fool, don't you know anything?

951
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:05,674
Hey!

952
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:17,547
By now, the entire country has heard
about female quarterback phenomenon,

953
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:18,644
Jasmine Plummer.

954
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,589
<i>She's carried the Browns to the playoffs</i>
<i>and they need one more win</i>

955
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:26,116
<i>to reach Pop Warner's Mid-American</i>
<i>Super Bowl for the first time</i>

956
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,461
<i>in 20 years. Part of that delay may have</i>
<i>to do with the harsh times</i>

957
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,798
<i>that have hit Minden.</i>
<i>When the town's plant closed down,</i>

958
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,465
<i>jobs left, poverty and crime set in.</i>

959
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,476
<i>That is why Jasmine Plummer's rise</i>
<i>is so crucial to the town's</i>

960
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,138
<i>- struggling citizens.</i>
- Hey.

961
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:49,145
Lookit here.
I don't know about the rest of you,

962
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,244
but that certainly
isn't the Minden I know.

963
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,146
Look outside there.

964
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:58,751
What do you see?
Main Street, right?

965
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,693
But the people in the news,

966
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:04,164
they are only gonna see
a rundown, dirty road.

967
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,098
- That's true.
- At the very least,

968
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,898
we can fix up our main drag,
now, can't we?

969
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:12,372
How we supposed to do that, rev?
This town ain't got no money.

970
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:15,308
- Nothing.
- It ain't all about the money.

971
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,176
Now lookit here.
The one thing we do know

972
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,683
is that here in Minden,
we got heart. Hey, lookit here.

973
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:26,381
Curtis and his team have shown us that.

974
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,480
Come on, ya'll.

975
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:32,118
Remember what I said in church
about if you only focus

976
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,630
on what you don't have,
you gonna forget about what you do have?

977
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,165
- Hmm.
- [quiet chatter]

978
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,667
Well I have another saying
when I ain't in church.

979
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:44,832
Sometimes, you just
got to wipe your own ass.

980
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,033
Amen.

981
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:59,587
- Shoot one over the side!
- You keep doing that, man, I tell you,

982
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:03,113
- I'll slap you upside your head.
- Get that? Hold up, hold up.

983
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,092
- Wait a minute.
- Man!

984
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,493
Got no time to be lookin'
at no scratch-off.

985
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:13,434
You can reach up better
with this roller.

986
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,030
Give me that!

987
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:25,536
What took you so long?
I almost killed myself.

988
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,013
Looking good, Kosowski.

989
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:33,147
- Hi, guys. Everybody's working.
- [chatter]

990
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:36,714
- [ladder rattling]
- Whoa, whoa! Hey!

991
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:41,559
- Kosowski! Grab that for me.
- All right.

992
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:44,292
All right. See you later.

993
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,336
- Hey, Minden's back!
- Whoa!

994
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,392
Minden!

995
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,497
I wanna take a little time right now
to acknowledge Feathers

996
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,271
for scoring an amazing touchdown
this Saturday.

997
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:59,644
Now, my favorite part is when
my man gets in the end zone,

998
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,148
he do the dance.

999
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:04,311
Man, you got to celebrate
all that hard work.

1000
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,356
Let me see that dance, Feathers.
I want everybody to step in

1001
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,687
and do that little dance.
See what you got.

1002
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:12,159
[# Tag Team: <i>Whoomp! (There It Is)]</i>

1003
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:16,758
Oh, my God!

1004
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:20,124
What you got, pretty boy?
What you got?

1005
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:25,003
<i>Thriller?</i>
Was you even alive when that came out?

1006
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,268
What you got? Come on, long hair.

1007
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,171
[all cheer]

1008
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,715
Always a breakdancer.

1009
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:38,378
You gotta work on that. Do ya'll wanna
see what I used to do on this field

1010
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,684
- when I scored?
- Come on, show us, coach.

1011
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,520
When I got in the end zone,
I had to go old school.

1012
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,890
- Old school.
- Jasmine, you be the ref.

1013
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,189
I used to clown the ref.

1014
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:52,565
When I scored, when I got in the
end zone, I used to look at the ref,

1015
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,468
and then I used to hand him the ball.

1016
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:57,972
Act like I've been there before.

1017
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:02,477
And that's what we gonna do on this
team. We act like we been there before.

1018
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,673
We gonna have some class,
we gonna have some sportsmanship.

1019
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,580
Blue 31! Hut, hut!

1020
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,713

1021
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,727

1022
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:30,298

1023
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:33,671

1024
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:36,702
Hut, hut!

1025
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,442
Come on!

1026

He's got it!

1027
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,193
- [whistle blows]
- Yeah!

1028
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:59,165
- We're going to the Super Bowl!
- Whoo!

1029
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,203
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1030
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:06,236
Here we go. Here we go. Yeah!

1031
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,639
[whistle blows]

1032
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,837
- Congratulations, coach.
- Well done.

1033
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,775
[man] Hey, Curtis.

1034
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,217
Look like you done put on a few pounds.

1035
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,403
What you want, Roy?

1036
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,304
- What you doin' here?
- What I'm doin'?

1037
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,571
I came to see my kid
play a little pigskin, brotha.

1038
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:44,772
Been seein' her all over the TV.

1039
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:48,339
Look like the apple fell
under the tree, know what I'm sayin'?

1040
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,751
Come on, now, fix your face
and give your brother...

1041
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,025
What's all that for?
What's the matter?

1042
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:01,256
What's the matter? Do you know
what you did to that girl?

1043
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,458
By leaving her like that?
Now you gonna show up here

1044
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,933
out of the blue 'cause she on TV?

1045
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,402
Look, a lot of things happened, man.

1046
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:13,131
But I'm gonna make it up to Jasmine, OK?

1047
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,043
How? After five years?
How you gonna make it up, huh?

1048
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,338
What you gonna do, you gonna waltz in
and then waltz outta her life?

1049
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,909
That's what you gonna do, Roy.
I know you, Roy.

1050
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:29,924
Crawl back to whatever rock you done
came from under. We don't need you.

1051
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,085
- Dad?
- Showing up like this a family...

1052
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,829
Jasmine?

1053
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,163
Is that my baby girl?

1054
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,863
Oh, my goodness!
Look how big you got.

1055
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,867
- You were amazing out there.
- We made it to the Super Bowl.

1056
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,001
I know. I saw.

1057
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,773
Congratulations. Gimme some.

1058
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:55,411
Oh, my goodness! I miss you so much.

1059
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:56,542
We did it.

1060
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:02,880
You know, you lookin' like your daddy
out there, back in his day.

1061
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:06,926
Let's go and celebrate.

1062
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:08,987
- You wanna go get some ice cream?
- OK.

1063
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,895
Come on.

1064
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,501
I really love football.

1065
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,135
Uncle Curtis is so great.
He's been teaching me.

1066
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,577
You lookin' real good out there.

1067
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:29,243
Actually, back when I played, I was
actually better than your Uncle Curtis.

1068
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,513
- Really?
- I bet he didn't tell you that.

1069
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:35,079
- He never told me.
- I taught that boy everything he knows.

1070
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:38,320
How to throw the ball,
how to stay in the pocket,

1071
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:41,227
- how to read the defense, everything.
- Wow.

1072
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,266
But that was back
when he was a little bit skinnier.

1073
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,892
So you are going to the Super Bowl.

1074
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,199
Yeah.

1075
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,400
Now that I'm back, I'm gonna be
in them stands hollering,

1076
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,740
cheering you on.
I'm sure you gonna win.

1077

1078
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,711
Oh, man, it's getting late.

1079
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,446
Hey, Claire! What's the damage?

1080
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,751
- I got it.
- You sure?

1081
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:12,089
- I said I got it.
- All right.

1082
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,959
All right, Jasmine.
I got some things to do.

1083
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:17,965
- OK.
- I'll see you at the Super Bowl.

1084
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:21,491
- OK.
- Come give me some.

1085
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,108
I'm proud of you, OK? All right.

1086
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:31,835
Bye, Dad.

1087
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,149
[man] Get somebody else, man.
That's all.

1088
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:42,315
Oh, OK, he's here. We can start.

1089
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,656
Hey. What's goin' on?

1090
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:48,919
I just got off the phone
with Pop Warner.

1091
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,625
We gotta cover
our own costs for the Super Bowl:

1092
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:57,468
Travel, hotel, insurance,
food, everything.

1093
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,565
We don't need nothin' fancy,
so shouldn't be a problem.

1094
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:03,475
- We don't have it, Curtis.
- The other team,

1095
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,070
they come from towns
that have a lot of money.

1096
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:10,346
We got the heart, we just
ain't quite got the pocketbook.

1097
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:12,751
I don't know, reverend.

1098
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:16,416
'Cause if we got heart,
we got everything we need.

1099
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,550
[man] I feel like this is the day
I'm gonna hit. Feeling lucky.

1100
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,186
[man 2] Mm-hmm.

1101
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,664
Whoo! Come on, now, baby.
I need a new pair of shoes!

1102
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,463
You need a new game, man.
I'm tired of beating you.

1103
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:31,597
- What's this, 1,500 in a row?
- Hold up. I got cherries.

1104
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,540
- Come on.
- You hear me? I got cherries.

1105
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:38,671
- You mean lemons.
- No, no, brother. I got cherries!

1106
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,612
- Jesus!
- That's right!

1107
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,116
- We need to cash this in!
- What about the game?

1108
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:44,482
- Forget that!
- Hold up!

1109
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:52,359
My most prized possession.
It might be worth more than a few bucks.

1110
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,225
It's for the team.

1111
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:57,932
Thank you, Edgar.

1112
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:04,398
He loves that ball, man.
That's all I know.

1113
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:12,335
[clears throat]

1114
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,217
Look... All right, all right.

1115
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,254
- Here.
- Thank you! Thank you, Kosowski!

1116
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,186
We better win!

1117
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:24,089
- They got enough!
- Put that, put that down. Come on, man.

1118
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:26,389
Come on with the cherries.
Come on, come on!

1119
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,431
There you go. I feel you. Come on.

1120
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:32,661
- Oh, I know you would...
- You better be glad I'm in a church!

1121
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:36,568
Don't mind him, he's a little sensitive.
You act like it was your money.

1122
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:43,507
You see this? Three cherries!
Great God!

1123
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:46,878
Hey, reverend. Now, for 20 years,

1124
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,918
you done heard me say
how much I wanted to leave Minden.

1125
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,751
Ever since my first job at the factory,

1126
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:56,347
that's what I've been
savin' up to do.

1127
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:59,986
But forget all that.
I wanna go to the Super Bowl.

1128
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,929
With this team and that quarterback.

1129
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:09,736
So... I know it ain't much,
but I hope it's enough.

1130
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,540
- Whoa!
- What?

1131
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,410
I think we're going to the Super Bowl.

1132
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,962

in the booth by Shaun Parker.

1136
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,439
- Good to see you.
- Thanks, John.

1137
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:52,037
I am looking forward to seeing
Jasmine Plummer play in person.

1138
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:56,141
- But she has her work cut out for her.
- But she's taking on a great team.

1139
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,619
They won last year. I'm talking
about the Huntersville Eagles.

1140
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:03,590
Just take a look at the stands. You can
see Huntersville fans have packed in.

1141
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,151
- As for Minden, they're empty.
- We're a long way from Minden.

1142
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,094
Where is Minden?

1143
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,898
We gonna win the Super Bowl today.

1144
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,926
You know why?
'Cause we from Minden.

1145
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:53,737
And don't nobody got a heart like we got
heart right here in this locker room.

1146
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,539
They might be bigger,

1147
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,480
but damn it, we better. All right?

1148
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:04,110
We gonna play fast,
we gonna play loose,

1149
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:07,246
and we gonna play for each other.
We gonna hit 'em hard,

1150
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:11,850
we gonna hit 'em often,
and we gonna have fun doin' it.

01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,922
No, you're right, John. The Eagles
set the tone from the opening kick

1176
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:56,725
and showed the Browns why they are
the defending Pop Warner champs.

1177
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:03,032
Hey. You ready?

1178
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,639
Why didn't he come?

1179
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:13,337
I don't know. I don't know.

1180
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:21,153
Well, maybe he made a mistake.
Maybe he thinks it's tomorrow.

1181
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,991
He just ain't coming. OK?

1182
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,260
Been knowing Roy my whole life.

1183
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:37,103
All he do is run from his problems.

1184
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,305
I guess a little of that
is in all of us, you know?

1185
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:50,282
But out of all the mistakes
that I've seen him make...

1186
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,315
...the biggest one was leaving you.

1187
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:03,222
I promise you,
I'll never make that mistake.

1188
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:12,602
So... why don't we go out here,

1189
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:16,576
and not worry about what's going on
in the stands.

1190
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:21,676
Let's just worry about what's going on
on the field.

1191
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,082
'Cause I need a quarterback.

1192
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:30,654
That's the only way we
gonna take this thing back to Minden.

1193
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:35,019
Good to go?

1194
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:41,330
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

<i>But they're down by 13 points.</i>

Hey, how you doing?

1244
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:54,962
We're officials
with the Miami Pop Warner League.

1245
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,965
We've real impressed
with what you've accomplished.

1246
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:01,628
- Thanks.
- I've got an opening the best team.

1247
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:04,672
- I'd love for you to be our man.
- If you haven't noticed,

Miami's not a bad place to live.

1249
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:11,069
Got that right.
It's pretty nice around here.

1250
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:13,614
It's Miami, man.

1251
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:18,952
I'll give you a call.

We almost there.

1254

But you're just gonna leave.

1255
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,186
I didn't say that.

1256
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:01,689
I heard them offer you
the job in Miami.

1257
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:05,557
Yeah.

1258
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,728
They offered me the job.

1259
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,837
They can offer me a thousand jobs.
But I ain't going nowhere.

1260
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:23,382
But Miami's your dream.
It's the place you always wanted to go.

1261
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:27,387
That's true. And I've been there.

1262
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,481
It's a cool place to visit,

1263
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,651

But... we lost.

You did such a good job.

I think it still turned out pretty good.

1285

y'all won that game anyway.

- Ennis.

No! We'll catch him at the park!
