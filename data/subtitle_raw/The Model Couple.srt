FiIe, pIease. Good.

You haven,t eaten, I hope.

00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,914
- Nice trip?
- Us?

43
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:42,890
We got Iost at first,
but after that it was easy.

44
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:45,755
Here,s the paperwork.

45
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:50,863
CIaudine, Jean-MicheI,
against the waII, pIease.

46
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:53,162
Very good. Now undress.

00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:54,896
That,s right - undress.

48
00:03:55,107 --> 00:03:58,702
Lab coats off,
shouIders against the waII.

49
00:04:07,753 --> 00:04:12,122
Jean-MicheI, teII us how you met.

50
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:13,615
Me or...

51
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:15,417
Sure, CIaudine.

52
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:20,394
At some friends, dinner party.
I hadn,t reaIIy noticed him.

53
00:04:20,999 --> 00:04:25,060
But at a certain point
our eyes met,

54
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,897
,cause we were both bored.

55
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,570
- You were bored?
- Yes.

56
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:30,298
THEY WERE BORED.

57
00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:35,008
He smiIed and then -

58
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,913
It wasn,t Iove at first sight, but...

59
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,613
I was surprised
when he caIIed me afterwards.

60
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,912
,,We got to know each other,,,
Iike in the song.

61
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:45,282
What song?

62
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,458
By Hugues Aufray.

63
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:49,217
CouId you sing it for us?

64
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,450
No, not Iike this.

65
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:51,959
REFUSES TO SING

66
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,359
- How about you?
- I don,t know it.

67
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:59,828
CouId you describe
your reIationship?

68
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:03,769
WeII, we,re very cIose.

69
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,499
THEY,RE CLOSE.

70
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:07,838
We,re different,
but compIementary.

71
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,013
Describe CIaudine.

72
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:13,644
She,s sweet.

73
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,910
She,s strong-wiIIed,
knows her own mind,

74
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,248
meticuIous.

75
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:21,051
- How do you show that?
- For exampIe -

76
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:24,557
Hands up.

77
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:31,332
At first, Jean-MicheI
expected me to serve him.

78
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,498
It was aIways me
who brought up breakfast.

79
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:37,868
He,d never think
to bring me breakfast.

80
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,340
- You Iived in a house?
- A house?

81
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:43,105
You said ,,brought up breakfast.,,

82
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:45,977
It,s just an expression.
We Iive in an apartment.

83
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:47,947
- I see.
- Very good.

84
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:53,814
What about poIitics?
What roIe does it pIay in your Iife?

85
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:59,260
PoIitics? We,re neither
Ieft- nor right-wing.

86
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,455
NEITHER LEFT- NOR RIGHT-WING

87
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,329
We,re not activists,
but we keep up with the news.

88
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:08,896
Jean-MicheI and CIaudine,
you know why you,re here.

89
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,773
We,re designing

00:06:11,977 --> 00:06:15,174
and we want its inhabitants

- Here he is.

98
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,363
Sorry. I went to get a map.

99
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:45,133
Here it is.

100
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:49,010
We,re off.
I,II Iead the way.

101
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:51,045
Come in.

102
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,641
,,ModeI apartment.,,

103
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:56,946
Living room, kitchen.

104
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,520
Excuse me.

105
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,556
This way.
- It,s big!

106
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:04,324
Come on in.

107
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,865
This is the Iiving room.

108
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:11,367
As you can see,
it,s not quite finished,

109
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,232
but you,II have furniture
tomorrow.

110
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,798
What are those numbers?

111
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:20,338
Those are... reference points.

112
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:25,613
I,II just go get the -

113
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:28,285
Here we are.

114
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:30,682
With some furniture -

115
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:35,554
,,WaII.,,

116
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,086
That cIears things up!

117
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,822
Yuck!
I feeI Iike I,m in diapers.

118
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,762
HoId on.
Let me show you.

119
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,938
Here I come.
It,s very chic.

120
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,838
I rang the doorbeII.
Didn,t you hear?

121
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:57,712
I brought your dinner.

122
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,883
Can I heIp?

123
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:01,484
No need. Sit down.

124
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,114
The gas wiII be
hooked up tomorrow,

125
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:07,587
so you,II be abIe to cook
for yourseIves.

126
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,726
Water. Wine.

127
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:16,500
It,s not working.
Excuse me.

128
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,635
There. You,re on TV.

129
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:21,704
- What wiII we do tomorrow?
- You,II see.

130
00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:31,305
Here,s a mattress.
The bedroom wiII be ready tomorrow.

131
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:35,008
This afternoon the ModeI CoupIe
moved into their happy new home.

132
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:40,652
We,II foIIow this fascinating experiment
cIoseIy over the next six months.

133
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:44,090
Tonight aII of France wonders,

134
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:47,197
,,Who are you,
CIaudine and Jean-MicheI?,,

135
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,732
We,II try to answer
with a few images.

136
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:53,529
CIaudine is 25,

137
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:58,266
a keypunch operator
at a maiI-order company. She,s Parisian.

138
00:08:58,476 --> 00:09:00,501
Jean-MicheI is 29,

139
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:03,379
from Thonon-Ies-Bains.

140
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:06,478
In middIe management
at a Iarge marketing firm,

141
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:09,882
he earns 3,220 francs a month.

142
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:14,320
He,s dynamic, athIetic,
conscientious, and IikabIe.

143
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,426
Married two years, they pIan to have
their first chiId in the ModeI Apartment,

144
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:24,762
and they,ve received speciaI Ieaves
of absence for the duration.

145
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,768
We,II Iet our coupIe settIe in.

146
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:31,067
We,II check in again tomorrow,
and throughout the experiment.

147
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:35,144
Good night, CIaudine
and Jean-MicheI, and good Iuck!

148
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:38,214
And now, the situation
in PortugaI -

149
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:40,344
Nice, huh?

150
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,282
What,s wrong?
- I,m afraid.

151
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:46,716
Why? What is it?

152
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,284
I don,t know.

153
00:09:48,493 --> 00:09:51,485
Sweetie pie, what,s wrong?

154
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:54,561
Are you okay?

155
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,027
This is science. It,s not -

156
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,898
I don,t know.

157
00:10:04,609 --> 00:10:06,372
That woman -

158
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,512
Have you seen my piIIs?

159
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,442
Aren,t they on the tabIe?

160
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:14,084
You know, I reaIIy feeI awfuI.

161
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:15,684
What are they doing?

162
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:27,965
CIaudine,s feeIing down. She,s crying.
Jean-MicheI is comforting her.

163
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:30,494
They,re such a pain!

164
00:10:34,105 --> 00:10:37,438
,,I,m aIways the one
who brings up breakfast.,,

165
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,712
Time for our IittIe show.

166
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:45,272
It,s ready, ma,am.

167
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:51,822
3, 2, 1 .

168
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,619
Be happy.

169
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:58,387
Love one another.
We,re creating this city for you.

170
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,530
To make you happy.

171
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,632
Be happy, but not too happy.

172
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:05,735
Too happy and you,d have
nothing to wish for.

173
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:08,667
- What,s this crap?
- You think they,re Iistening?

174
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:11,171
Not just Iistening.
Look.

175
00:11:12,377 --> 00:11:14,368
- Cameras?
- Of course.

176

Don,t forget the finishing touch!

330

Express yourseIves with sounds.

354
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:46,263
Sounds?

355
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,497
Don,t think, just do it.
Express yourseIf with sounds.

356
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:00,572
CIaudine, wait your turn.
Jean-MicheI is first.

357
00:23:01,418 --> 00:23:02,715
Me...

358
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:10,287
Okay, caIm down

359
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:12,758
and speak using numbers.

360
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:17,527
Numbers!

361
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:20,629
This isn,t a game.

362
00:23:22,473 --> 00:23:26,637
3 - 3 - 3 - 33 - 33 - 22 - 40 !

363
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:29,705
Thank you.

364
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:34,510
TODAY WENT WELL.
IN FACT, REALLY WELL.

365
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:38,221
Things went weII today, huh?

366
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:39,787
Yes, I think so.

367
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,450
EspeciaIIy at the end.
They seemed reaIIy pIeased.

368
00:23:44,662 --> 00:23:47,722
Yeah, I think they,re pIeased.

369
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:50,799
But she hates me.
I,m sure of it.

370
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:51,831
Her?

371
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:54,800
I can see it in her eyes.
She can,t stand me.

372
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:58,168
No, you,ve got her aII wrong.

373
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:01,067
She onIy seems coId and serious

374
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,839
because she,s a scientist.
She,s not reaIIy mean.

375
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,641
You don,t think so?

376
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:08,648
What did you do today?

377
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:10,844
Today? Let me see.

378
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:15,782
I tested steering wheeIs and pens.

379
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:17,351
How was it?

380
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:18,892
Okay.

381
00:24:19,597 --> 00:24:21,292
Steering wheeIs?

382
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,932
How was your day?

383
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:28,400
I made -

384
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,176
I was in the kitchen.

385
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:34,844
Did you see the resuIts?

386
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:37,343
There weren,t any.
It was just

387
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:42,248
these guys who were there
with different stuff.

388
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:44,819
CarefuI.
Not under there.

389
00:24:45,022 --> 00:24:46,387
Why not?

390
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,718
I think tonight we,d better not.

391
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:51,121
Why not?

392
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:54,456
I,m sure we,re covered
with wires for a reason.

393
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:16,349
CIaudine, you get 400 francs
for this week,s groceries.

394
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:19,483
Buy onIy what,s necessary.

395
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:21,953
You have 30 minutes. Go.

396
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:40,634
You chose ArieI.

397
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:44,780
What about two boxes
of Dash instead?

398
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:46,347
Okay.

399
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:51,054
- Or three boxes of Omo?
- Okay.

400
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,351
How about four boxes
of Dato instead?

401
00:25:58,562 --> 00:25:59,859
Sure!

402
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:17,880
And finaIIy,
three boxes of X-Tra instead?

403
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:20,482
Three boxes of X-Tra?

404
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,321
- Is this a giveaway?
- Can we have some?

405
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:33,887
PineappIes fresh from the Ivory Coast,
cookies of the highest quaIity.

406
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:39,798
On speciaI today..
Frankfurt wieners and Spanish beans!

407
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:43,337
Our bananas
are never stringy or mushy.

408
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,269
A Iady shouId aIways be
weII-groomed.

409
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:48,968
Is the Pernod saIesman
stiII in the store?

410
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,473
Don,t break anything.

411
00:26:57,855 --> 00:27:00,824
422.80 francs.

412
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:04,216
- Did she go over?
- 422.80 francs.

413
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:06,658
422.80 francs.

414
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:09,833
- WeII, CIaudine?
- This couId go back.

415
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:14,060
And this.

416
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:16,603
Are you keeping this?

417
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:22,512
AII right.

418
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:26,077
Now expIain
your purchases for me.

419
00:27:47,037 --> 00:27:48,470
This is the best one.

420
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:50,196
Go?

421
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,222
AII done.

422
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,531
What?

423
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:20,568
Nothing.

424
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,936
Good.

425
00:28:26,643 --> 00:28:28,804
I,II try the second one now.

426
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:54,430
The first one,s better.

427
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:04,671
Have you seen my -

428
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:17,423
What the heII
did you do with my paper?

429
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:22,922
ZoIa.

430
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:34,170
BaIzac.

431
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:38,778
No, we said we,d put ZoIa here.

432
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:40,711
You said ZoIa goes there.

433
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:43,284
You never Iisten!
ZoIa goes here.

434
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:45,011
You want ZoIa? Here!

435
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:47,621
Are you nuts?

436
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:49,723
That,s right!

437
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,637
THE GREAT PAINTERS

438
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:08,675
Sweetie, where do
the great painters go?

439
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,212
Maybe up there?

440
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:14,416
I don,t know.

441
00:30:14,718 --> 00:30:16,515
Put them over there.

442
00:30:19,356 --> 00:30:21,620
Not Iike that! Not there!

443
00:30:27,864 --> 00:30:32,358
Jean-MicheI,
feeI your way to CIaudine.

444
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:36,300
When you find her,
expIore her body with your hands.

445
00:30:36,506 --> 00:30:39,998
Describe what you feeI.
Be honest.

446
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:43,071
I got the feeIing
she was hiding.

447
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,871
It,s her aII right.

448
00:32:13,904 --> 00:32:14,871
Good.

449
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:19,839
Jean-MicheI,
take one step forward

450
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:25,715
and faII backward
into CIaudine,s arms.

451
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,213
Go.

452
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,182
Very good.

453
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:32,914
Take off his bIindfoId.

454
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,989
How do you feeI?

455
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:41,130
It,s weird.
I was a IittIe afraid.

456
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:44,628
Good. By the way,
have you seen my pen?

457
00:32:44,835 --> 00:32:46,894
I Ieft it here.

458
00:32:48,271 --> 00:32:49,738
ReaIIy?

459
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:53,768
Sometimes we pick up things
without thinking.

460
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:55,945
But we didn,t!

461
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:57,841
May I?

462
00:32:58,882 --> 00:33:01,077
Are you kidding?

463
00:33:02,185 --> 00:33:03,584
PIease.

464
00:33:04,121 --> 00:33:05,850
We don,t have your pen.

465
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,757
That,s enough!
We don,t have it!

466
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,728
Sixteen seconds. NormaI.

467
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:15,056
Sixteen seconds? NormaI?

468
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:20,066
You toIerated aggressivity
towards yourseIf, but not CIaudine.

469
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:24,935
A common protective refIex,
but within a short time frame.

470
00:33:26,143 --> 00:33:28,270
Stop measuring everything!

471
00:33:28,512 --> 00:33:31,447
Leave us aIone, damn it!

472
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,411
- ,,Damn it,,?
- Yes, damn it!

473
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:35,812
Twenty-four seconds.
Very good.

474
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,714
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

475
00:33:40,657 --> 00:33:44,525
- I can,t stand this.
- Sure you can. It,s not so bad.

476
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:47,754
Besides,
it,s for science, right?

477
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:51,263
My modeI sweetie pie!

478
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:55,598
ModeI sweetie pie...

479
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:01,448
- Visitors.
- I know.

480
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:14,999
WouId you give this Iady
your autograph?

481
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:18,338
If you wouId.

482
00:37:20,143 --> 00:37:22,134
Thanks very much.

483
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:26,849
- Did they give you aII this stuff?
- No, but we,II get a discount.

484
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,211
It shouId be free.

485
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,714
It,s aII name-brand stuff.

486
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:35,548
You were great on TV.

487
00:37:35,759 --> 00:37:37,750
Is Jean-MicheI here?

488
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:40,054
He,s around somewhere.

489
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:43,061
Bravo, CIaudine.

490
00:38:24,774 --> 00:38:27,106
Kids, stop it!

491
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,139
UnbeIievabIe!

492
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,971
- You use aII this stuff?
- Sure.

493
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,572
With the dining nook over there,
they,d have more room.

494
00:39:05,782 --> 00:39:08,876
- I Iike it this way.
- And the beam is charming.

495
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:11,076
I,d put up a waII.

496
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:14,415
Go back to your spot.

497
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:15,817
He was transferred.

498
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:20,758
I don,t understand why Cruyft
pIays for Madrid now.

499
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:23,626
It,s not ,,Cruyft,,,
it,s Johan Cruijff.

500
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:26,529
And it,s not Madrid,
it,s BarceIona.

501
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:29,330
No, not my stereo!

502
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:32,336
Be carefuI! It,s very fragiIe.

503
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:34,275
Give me that.

504
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:38,072
Kids, that,s not a toy!

505
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:43,044
Back to your pIaces now.

506
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,421
Guess how much
the Camembert was.

507
00:39:50,627 --> 00:39:53,926
- I don,t know. Five francs?
- 4.35.

508
00:39:54,531 --> 00:39:56,522
Where,d you get it?

509
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:00,062
I got that...

510
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:04,200
Have you seen my tape,
WoIfgang?

511
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:08,472
Where the heII did I put
that damn tape?

512
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,077
And he pIays Mr. Nice Guy!

513
00:40:11,281 --> 00:40:16,184
He onIy wants to be the object
of positive transference and affection,

514
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:19,685
and I get aII the negativity!

515
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,914
Give me a break!

516
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,619
Know what your probIem is?

517
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:28,621
At first you wanted to be
the aII-powerfuI phaIIic mother

518
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:30,993
manipuIating Iove and hate,

519
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:35,137
but you never responded
to their demands for Iove and bonding

520
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:39,866
because you couIdn,t stand
being part of the very tests you reject.

521
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:43,806
Your subconscious
spiIIed over into your work.

522
00:40:44,013 --> 00:40:48,143
You swayed the experiment in
the CoupIe,s favor by being aggressive,

523
00:40:48,351 --> 00:40:53,254
because deep down
you no Ionger want to be a ,,tooI,,,

524
00:40:53,456 --> 00:40:56,152
a mere ,,technician,,!

525
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,795
You aIways oversimpIify, sweetie.

526
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:02,123
It,s much more compIicated.

527
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:05,524
What if I was doing it
on purpose from the start?

528
00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:07,392
Right!

529
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:12,307
What did I do with that tape?
Did I erase it?

530
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,909
CIaudine, Jean-MicheI,
good morning!

531
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:29,909
I,II be showing you some images,
and I,d Iike to know whether,

532
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,917
if the thing or person
shown disappeared,

533
00:42:33,122 --> 00:42:36,922
you,d be happier,
Iess happy, or indifferent.

534
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,788
Happier, Iess happy,
or indifferent. Okay.

535
00:42:39,996 --> 00:42:41,588
If what?

536
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:45,256
If the person disappeared,
wouId you be happier or Iess happy?

537
00:42:45,468 --> 00:42:47,936
Ready? Here we go.

538
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:51,838
Happier.

539
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:54,467
Happier.

540
00:42:55,712 --> 00:42:57,270
Less happy.

541
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,443
- Indifferent.
- I Iike it.

542
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:05,880
- Happier.
- Happier.

543
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:12,592
How awfuI!

544
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:16,431
- Happier.
- Happier.

545
00:43:17,066 --> 00:43:19,227
- Indifferent.
- Less happy.

546
00:43:22,472 --> 00:43:26,067
Oh, definiteIy happier!

547
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:28,236
Very good.

548
00:43:28,444 --> 00:43:32,505
Now, if I asked you point-bIank,
,,Are you happy?,,

549
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:35,479
what wouId you say?
Very happy? MostIy happy?

550
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:40,088
Happy? MostIy unhappy?
Very unhappy? No opinion?

551
00:43:40,757 --> 00:43:43,385
- We,re mostIy happy.
- MostIy happy?

552
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:45,322
I,d say so.

553
00:43:45,528 --> 00:43:47,655
I shouId check ,,mostIy happy,,?

554
00:43:47,864 --> 00:43:49,559
I think so.

555
00:43:49,766 --> 00:43:52,963
WeII, maybe that,s too strong.

556
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:55,637
Maybe just ,,happy.,,

557
00:43:56,773 --> 00:43:59,105
I shouId put ,,happy,,?

558
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:01,869
Yes, check ,,happy.,,

559
00:44:02,945 --> 00:44:06,506
- I,II put ,,happy.,,
- It,s not Iike we,re unhappy!

560
00:44:06,716 --> 00:44:08,684
You,re not unhappy?

561
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:11,484
We just toId you we,re not!

562
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:14,483
Not unhappy at aII?

563
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:21,158
I mean, it,s not
aIways easy, but -

564
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,190
So you,re not unhappy.

565
00:44:25,401 --> 00:44:27,198
Sometimes.

566
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:31,502
What do I check?

567
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:34,568
I don,t know.

568
00:44:35,044 --> 00:44:37,478
Put ,,sIightIy unhappy,, if you want.

569
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,875
I don,t want anything.

570
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,483
It,s up to you.
What do you want?

571
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:46,849
She doesn,t know and neither do I!
Don,t check anything!

572
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,824
Fine. Then we,re done.

573
00:44:50,026 --> 00:44:52,756
Good, we,re done.
Let,s have a drink.

574
00:44:52,962 --> 00:44:55,556
How about having a drink with us?

575
00:44:55,765 --> 00:44:56,925
Lights!

576
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,591
Are you aIIowed
during work hours?

577
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:03,499
It,s not that.
We,re way behind scheduIe.

578
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:05,936
Whatever you Iike.
Our door is aIways open.

579
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:08,702
Thanks. Another time.

580
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:11,873
Listen, we were wondering:

581
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:17,442
How did you end up
working here?

582
00:45:17,653 --> 00:45:21,282
- You think it,s weird?
- I,m not criticizing. It,s just...

583
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:25,382
you dissect peopIe,
examine them, manipuIate them.

584
00:45:25,595 --> 00:45:27,529
We don,t manipuIate anyone.

585
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,027
ReaIIy?

586
00:45:29,665 --> 00:45:32,998
You know, Jean-MicheI,

587
00:45:33,202 --> 00:45:35,329
we question these things too.

588
00:45:35,538 --> 00:45:37,335
ConstantIy.

589
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,609
With a degree in psychosocioIogy,
what are our options?

590
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:45,746
One is the System,
with a capitaI S:

591
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:48,416
marketing or advertising
and a fat paycheck,

592
00:45:48,618 --> 00:45:51,587
and Iots of what
you caII manipuIation.

593
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:56,087
Another is the system
with a Iowercase S:

594
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:58,260
research, academia,

595
00:45:58,461 --> 00:46:01,430
and pIaces Iike this,
the Ministry of the Future.

596
00:46:01,797 --> 00:46:04,061
What shouId we do?
- Okay, I get it.

597
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:06,701
Raise sheep in the boonies,

598
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:11,067
or join the system
to throw a monkey wrench in it?

599
00:46:11,274 --> 00:46:14,732
What we,re reaIIy interested in,
what I care about,

600
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:17,970
is how perverse
the sociaI sciences can be.

601
00:46:18,347 --> 00:46:22,010
For exampIe, we both used
to work in an asyIum.

602
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:25,548
We changed quite a few things,

603
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:28,622
even on an everyday IeveI.

604
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:32,954
We don,t want to make probIems.
Check ,,happy.,,

605
00:46:33,162 --> 00:46:35,756
I,II check whatever you Iike.

606
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:39,332
I just don,t understand
why you refused to cooperate.

607
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:43,767
We didn,t. It just feIt Iike
you expected a certain answer.

608
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:45,406
That,s right!

609
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:47,576
What answer?

610
00:46:47,777 --> 00:46:48,744
I don,t know.

611
00:46:48,945 --> 00:46:52,312
Why isn,t there a box
for ,,fairIy happy,,?

612
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:54,676
We have ,,mostIy happy,,,
don,t we?

613
00:46:54,884 --> 00:46:56,374
It,s not the same!

614
00:46:56,586 --> 00:46:58,611
We can,t have dozens of options.

615
00:46:58,821 --> 00:47:02,188
If we say ,,fairIy happy,,,
which box do you check?

616
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:05,849
This is aII quibbIing over words.

617
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:10,625
It,s just a check box,
not The Brothers Karamazov!

618
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:14,200
That option isn,t offered.

619
00:47:14,403 --> 00:47:16,564
It,s a pity,
but that,s how it is.

620
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:18,501
You make me Iaugh!

621
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,471
We make him Iaugh.

622
00:47:20,676 --> 00:47:23,736
WeII, you two are
starting to worry us.

623
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:26,210
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

624
00:47:26,482 --> 00:47:30,441
You were chosen
because you were 76-/- average,

625
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:37,056
and after just a few days,
you,re bareIy 44-/- average.

626
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,228
I was about to teII you:

627
00:47:39,428 --> 00:47:43,228
If you don,t stay above 50-/-,
you won,t be here Iong.

628
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:46,196
We,re not above 50-/-?

629
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:48,863
We,re not making this up.

630
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:52,370
Think of your country,
of yourseIves,

631
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:57,512
of everything we,ve done.
It,d be a terribIe waste.

632
00:47:57,713 --> 00:47:59,977
They,II make us pay for everything,
just you wait!

633
00:48:00,182 --> 00:48:03,549
- Is that supposed to be irony?
- Why, is it forbidden?

634
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,577
Listen, Jean-MicheI.

635
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:09,520
Do you think
you,re doing this aII by yourseIf?

636
00:48:09,725 --> 00:48:11,852
Have you any idea
what we must deaI with?

637
00:48:12,061 --> 00:48:14,586
Sometimes I wonder
why we bother.

638
00:48:14,797 --> 00:48:18,130
I thought scientists
were much more patient.

639
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:21,666
At work we deaI
with reIationships and statistics -

640
00:48:21,871 --> 00:48:24,431
Check 7 under ,,aggressiveness.,,

641
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,902
You,d put 7?

642
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:28,804
,,Check 7.,,
There you go again!

643
00:48:29,045 --> 00:48:30,774
You want aggressiveness?

644
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,039
Let me handIe this.

645
00:48:33,249 --> 00:48:35,479
- Maybe 8.
- Right, check 8.

646
00:48:35,685 --> 00:48:38,210
Your coIIeague said 8.
Check that.

647
00:48:38,421 --> 00:48:42,357
Note, ,,The CoupIe
find the technicians very amusing.,,

648
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:45,092
PersonaIIy, I,m very tired,

649
00:48:45,294 --> 00:48:48,752
and right now
I reaIIy don,t find this amusing.

650
00:48:48,964 --> 00:48:51,865
Then just check ,,no opinion.,,

651
00:48:52,535 --> 00:48:55,231
I,m not checking anything.
You can, if you Iike,

652
00:48:55,438 --> 00:48:59,135
but I won,t check just any box.
This isn,t tic-tac-toe!

653
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:01,401
We,re getting off the point.

654
00:49:01,977 --> 00:49:06,311
We,re Iucky this is on camera,
or no one wouId beIieve it.

655
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,845
CaIm down!

656
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:11,679
Just checking.

657
00:49:11,887 --> 00:49:13,479
Let,s put 8.

658
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:17,147
I give up!
This is a Ioony bin!

659
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,555
At the risk of being rude,

660
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:24,232
Jean-MicheI, Iast night you suffered
once again from premature ejacuIation.

661
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:27,163
Perhaps.
It happens sometimes.

662
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:32,205
But I think
you,re being judgmentaI

663
00:49:32,842 --> 00:49:36,175
or trying to annoy me,
and that,s out of Iine.

664
00:49:36,379 --> 00:49:39,075
Listen, we practicaIIy
Iive together,

665
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:41,806
yet we hardIy know each other.

666
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:45,783
For exampIe,
what,s your reIationship?

667
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:48,785
I,m not sure how to take that.

668
00:49:49,258 --> 00:49:52,352
You know everything
about us, but we -

669
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:54,654
Listen, Jean-MicheI.

670
00:49:55,564 --> 00:49:58,192
Let,s say
you,re at the post office.

671
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:00,801
You wait in Iine.
You buy stamps.

672
00:50:01,003 --> 00:50:04,302
Do you ask the empIoyee,s name
or who they voted for?

673
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:07,943
I,m just saying it might be nice.

674
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:12,345
WeII, what do we put down?

675
00:50:13,482 --> 00:50:17,043
I get it - another test.
You,re trying to get us to crack.

676
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:19,448
- Is this on purpose?
- Where were we?

677
00:50:19,655 --> 00:50:23,955
PIease answer me:
Are you jerking us around?

678
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,152
Jean-MicheI, I swear

679
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:30,855
by aII our coIIeagues
and aII our tests

680
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:33,460
that we,d never do that.

681
00:50:33,702 --> 00:50:35,670
By no means.

682
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:40,239
For the Iast time,
Iook deep inside yourseIves

683
00:50:40,443 --> 00:50:42,502
and teII us what to put down.

684
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:45,712
Just check ,,happy.,,

685
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:49,411
There! Isn,t that better?

686
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:55,288
We deserve awards
for that performance!

687
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:56,583
What?

688
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:01,755
Your expIanations
sure were Iame.

689
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:03,625
WeII, they worked!

690
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:06,893
,,PIease answer me:
Are you jerking us around?,,

691
00:51:07,102 --> 00:51:08,660
,,Never!,,

692
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:15,743
Commence Phase 4: denormaIization
and de-modeIization of CoupIe B-1 4.

693
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:19,546
What do they think we,re doing?
- Jerking them around.

694
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:22,444
They didn,t mind at first.
But now?

695
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:23,982
We,II see.

696
00:51:25,688 --> 00:51:29,749
I didn,t enIist in the army!
Drop this French buIIshit.

697
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:35,892
I don,t beIieve this.

698
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:39,663
Did you see her face
when I said,

699
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:43,805
,,Put down that the CoupIe finds
the technicians amusing.,,,

700
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:46,739
,,I don,t find you amusing.,,

701
00:51:47,009 --> 00:51:49,477
This Camembert isn,t bad.

702
00:51:49,678 --> 00:51:52,738
- What?
- This Camembert isn,t bad.

703
00:51:52,948 --> 00:51:54,575
You,re out of synch!

704
00:51:55,017 --> 00:51:56,814
Out of what?

705
00:51:57,686 --> 00:52:01,588
- Your words don,t match your Iips.
- Neither do yours.

706
00:52:04,627 --> 00:52:06,356
What,s going on?

707
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,326
- Again.
- What,s going on?

708
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,200
It,s back to normaI.

709
00:52:14,403 --> 00:52:16,928
What,s going on? Okay.

710
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:19,164
Geez, that scared me!

711
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:27,112
CLAUDINE ISN,T HAPPY

712
00:52:27,316 --> 00:52:28,840
NOT VERY HAPPY

713
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:30,985
NOT HAPPY AT ALL

714
00:52:31,186 --> 00:52:32,744
J-MICHEL
DOESN,T UNDERSTAND

715
00:52:38,227 --> 00:52:42,027
Today we,II study
how you quarreI.

716
00:52:42,298 --> 00:52:45,096
Get everything off your chests.

717
00:52:45,734 --> 00:52:48,567
- You want us to fight?
- Yes. Go on.

718
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:50,804
Just Iike that?

719
00:52:55,444 --> 00:52:57,435
WeII, um...

720
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:00,248
you,re dumb.

721
00:53:00,783 --> 00:53:02,410
No, you are.

722
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,615
Is that aII you can think of?

723
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:12,323
No, I couId say...
I,ve had enough.

724
00:53:12,528 --> 00:53:15,429
You go out.
You see peopIe and have fun,

725
00:53:15,631 --> 00:53:17,724
whiIe I,m stuck here aIone.

726
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:21,130
Then you come home
and get waited on.

727
00:53:21,403 --> 00:53:23,064
Are you kidding now?

728
00:53:23,272 --> 00:53:26,070
Sure, I Iaugh aII day Iong.

729
00:53:26,942 --> 00:53:28,842
And you cry too, right?

730
00:53:29,044 --> 00:53:30,705
What wouId you know?

731
00:53:30,913 --> 00:53:33,814
I couId teII you
a thing or two myseIf.

732
00:53:34,016 --> 00:53:36,075
Who supports us?

733
00:53:36,285 --> 00:53:39,948
What about after this experiment?
Who wiII work? Me.

734
00:53:40,155 --> 00:53:42,589
You think
I don,t support us?

735
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:45,191
You don,t know
what it,s Iike being stuck here,

736
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:48,363
spied on by those voyeurs
in bIack coats!

737
00:53:48,564 --> 00:53:52,295
I can,t even fart without being graded!
Think that,s fun?

738
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:55,231
You gotta be kidding.
What do you think I do?

739
00:53:55,437 --> 00:53:57,871
I work aII afternoon.

740
00:53:58,073 --> 00:54:02,134
You sit on your fat ass and push buttons.
That,s aII you,re good for.

741
00:54:02,344 --> 00:54:06,303
Here come the insuIts!
,,Fat ass,, and aII that.

742
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:11,345
Listen, I,ve got things to say,
and I mean it.

743
00:54:11,553 --> 00:54:14,317
I,ve about had it
with this experiment!

744
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:17,889
I,m fed up Iiving with you.
- Why,d you come then?

745
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:20,061
I never forced you!

746
00:54:20,262 --> 00:54:23,823
You did!
I was supposed to go to Canada.

747
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:28,366
Who wanted to do this?
Who stopped me from going to Canada?

748
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,597
Who stopped me from acting?
Admit it, it was you.

749
00:54:32,808 --> 00:54:37,438
Now you say
you didn,t want to come here?

750
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:40,206
- I did it for you.
- You,re such a Iiar!

751
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:43,249
You were gIad to come!
What,s more,

752
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:46,615
we,re gonna get tossed out,
and it,s aII your fauIt.

753
00:54:46,822 --> 00:54:50,849
SeriousIy, if you couId hear
your buIIshit yesterday -

754
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,359
I don,t want to be rude, but -

755
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:58,556
Why did you have to ask,
,,What,s your reIationship?,,

756
00:54:58,767 --> 00:55:00,758
And that stupid Iaugh!

757
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:03,062
Did you see them?

758
00:55:03,272 --> 00:55:05,467
The argument we,re watching -

759
00:55:05,674 --> 00:55:08,108
you cIaim it was spontaneous,

760
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,541
but we aII know it was scripted

761
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:14,375
and deveIoped

762
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:17,882
by the Ministry of PsychoanaIysis.
Let,s taIk about that!

763
00:55:18,087 --> 00:55:20,078
It gives me great pIeasure

764
00:55:20,289 --> 00:55:24,055
to see the experiment faiI.
What is this coupIe doing?

765
00:55:24,259 --> 00:55:27,524
They,re escaping structure
through confIict!

766
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,824
ConfIict is part of human nature

767
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:35,800
and must be deaIt with,
not covered up.

768
00:55:36,004 --> 00:55:39,132
They,re warning us,
''Watch out.

769
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:43,368
Any portrayaI of confIict-free
happiness Ieads to aIienation.

770
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:47,481
ReaI Iife is about deaIing
with confIict and resoIving it. "

771
00:55:47,683 --> 00:55:50,379
If I may interrupt -

772
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:54,181
The way you yeIIed
at me after dinner -

773
00:55:54,389 --> 00:55:57,916
Don,t pIay innocent.
That,s why I threw the ZoIas.

774
00:55:58,127 --> 00:55:59,992
You,re pissing me off.

775
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:03,062
You piss me off too!

776
00:56:03,265 --> 00:56:05,392
But I,m never aIIowed
to say anything!

777
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:09,037
If this is truIy a ModeI CoupIe,

778
00:56:09,238 --> 00:56:13,299
this experiment
wiII reveaI their needs

779
00:56:13,509 --> 00:56:18,310
and aIIow the government
to pIan manufacturing

780
00:56:18,514 --> 00:56:22,610
to fuIfiII those needs,

781
00:56:22,818 --> 00:56:24,615
thus wiping out inequaIity.

782
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,755
You say ,,average,,,
but average what?

783
00:56:27,956 --> 00:56:32,518
We can caIcuIate the average
number of feet among birds and cats,

784
00:56:32,728 --> 00:56:36,926
but they,re two entireIy
different popuIations

785
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:41,466
with entireIy different structures!
It,s crazy!

786
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,434
I have to say
that it frightens me.

787
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,339
I,m not denying that the ModeI CoupIe
represents something.

788
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:52,036
But I,d Iike to point out

789
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:55,910
that the trademark
of aII totaIitarian societies

790
00:56:56,118 --> 00:57:00,521
is to propagate
an image of an ideaI coupIe

791
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:02,087
or famiIy.

792
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:05,988
After aII, it,s the first time
we,ve had a chance

793
00:57:06,195 --> 00:57:10,131
to examine an average coupIe
from the inside,

794
00:57:10,332 --> 00:57:14,701
which makes this experiment unique
and absoIuteIy marveIous.

795
00:57:14,903 --> 00:57:16,837
But what we discover

796
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:19,701
may offend our beIiefs,

797
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:22,342
our convictions,
our unconscious.

798
00:57:22,544 --> 00:57:28,278
I don,t deny that I,m aggressive
towards this type of person!

799
00:57:28,483 --> 00:57:29,848
PIease, caIm down.

800
00:57:30,052 --> 00:57:36,321
But this is stiII an advanced,
IiberaI society, as far as I know.

801
00:57:36,525 --> 00:57:39,722
The poIice aren,t standing
behind me, so I can say -

802
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:41,919
Let him taIk, BonaIoi.

803
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,461
You see?

804
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:45,997
Stop it!

805
00:57:47,603 --> 00:57:49,571
Watch out, or I,II hit you!

806
00:57:49,805 --> 00:57:52,899
Don,t try that again!
You,re aII brawn, no brain!

807
00:57:53,508 --> 00:57:55,840
Stop it! Bastard!

808
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:13,795
Okay, okay.

809
00:58:15,264 --> 00:58:17,061
I Iost my temper.

810
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:19,164
Thanks. I noticed.

811
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:24,068
I,m sorry.

812
00:58:24,273 --> 00:58:26,400
Oh, don,t start whining!

813
00:58:28,377 --> 00:58:32,575
I was mad. I didn,t mean it.
Did I hurt you?

814
00:58:33,415 --> 00:58:35,246
Come on.

815
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:39,079
I,d Iike to thank our guests.

816
00:58:39,288 --> 00:58:42,348
Good night, viewers.
UntiI next time.

817
00:58:44,893 --> 00:58:49,853
Paris, whore of the worId

818
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,425
It,s been confirmed

819
00:58:53,635 --> 00:58:56,365
that GeneraI Pinochet
remains in criticaI condition.

820
00:58:56,571 --> 00:58:59,199
His famiIy is with him,

821
00:58:59,408 --> 00:59:02,343
and we hope
to have better news soon.

822
00:59:02,778 --> 00:59:04,746
Our ModeI CoupIe

823
00:59:04,947 --> 00:59:09,850
has now been ,,in orbit,, and under
constant surveiIIance for three weeks.

824
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,254
No iII effects to report.
Quite the opposite.

825
00:59:13,455 --> 00:59:17,084
However,
the City of the Future

826
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:19,192
has hit some snags.

827
00:59:19,394 --> 00:59:23,421
The project has stirred up
IocaI opposition:

828
00:59:23,632 --> 00:59:26,294
demonstrations
by workers, farmers,

829
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:29,493
smaII business owners,

830
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:32,333
to say nothing of ecoIogists,

831
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:35,169
and the movement
keeps growing.

832
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:40,212
The Ministry of the Future intends
to deIve into the probIem

833
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,145
by visiting the region
in coming days

834
00:59:43,352 --> 00:59:46,480
to better understand the situation.

835
00:59:46,688 --> 00:59:48,918
Isn,t there...

836
00:59:49,124 --> 00:59:51,991
any toast or anything?

837
00:59:52,194 --> 00:59:53,889
Want me to make some?

838
00:59:56,131 --> 00:59:58,122
ShaII I make some toast?

839
00:59:59,768 --> 01:00:01,861
No, don,t bother.

840
01:00:08,043 --> 01:00:12,036
Are you nuts?
What,s going on up there?

841
01:00:12,414 --> 01:00:14,439
You,re not hurt, I hope.

842
01:00:14,883 --> 01:00:16,748
What the heck -

843
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,043
What,s going on?

844
01:00:19,254 --> 01:00:24,624
It was a farmers,protest.
They,re gone now.

845
01:00:24,826 --> 01:00:26,726
Who,II cIean this up?

846
01:00:26,928 --> 01:00:29,954
I,m aII aIone here today!

847
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:32,457
Can I come out?

848
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:34,294
Can you beIieve it?

849
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,038
They,re nuts!

850
01:00:44,112 --> 01:00:48,173
It,s dramatic

851
01:00:49,084 --> 01:00:53,077
What,s going on? The minister,s
coming, and nothing,s ready.

852
01:00:53,288 --> 01:00:56,382
No one toId us about it.

853
01:00:56,591 --> 01:00:58,718
What do you mean?

854
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,862
You got a memo announcing
his visit a month ago.

855
01:01:03,065 --> 01:01:06,091
There it is, on the waII.
- Right.

856
01:01:06,301 --> 01:01:09,566
The same one that says
that in six months

857
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:12,706
we,d get a raise
and be promoted to IeveI B-4

858
01:01:12,908 --> 01:01:16,605
and never work
over 40 hours a week.

859
01:01:16,812 --> 01:01:20,908
Where,s that repIacement crew
you promised?

860
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:25,246
We,re here 24 hours a day.

861
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:27,387
Listen.

862
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:32,459
We,II discuss
your demands Iater.

863
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:37,859
AII I can say is
the minister arrives in five minutes.

864
01:01:38,066 --> 01:01:41,194
Union or no union,
if you,re not ready, you,II pay!

865
01:01:41,403 --> 01:01:43,337
- We,II see about that.
- Yes, we wiII!

866
01:01:43,538 --> 01:01:48,339
We,re not afraid of the minister.
I,ve got a few things to teII him.

867
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:52,070
If you bother the minister
with your probIems -

868
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,111
This is the controI room.

869
01:01:56,251 --> 01:01:59,482
HeIIo, Schneider.
Did you drop something?

870
01:01:59,688 --> 01:02:04,022
This is Dr. GoIdberg,
eminent psycho-futuroIogist,

871
01:02:04,226 --> 01:02:06,854
and his assistant, Mr. -

872
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:10,423
Very interesting.
What happens here?

873
01:02:10,632 --> 01:02:14,796
That,s what we,re here to show you.
FoIIow me.

874
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,763
This is our team.

875
01:02:19,808 --> 01:02:23,767
It,s an honor. My coIIeague
and I were just saying -

876
01:02:24,045 --> 01:02:26,138
In aII modesty, Minister,

877
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,146
we are here to serve mankind.

878
01:02:29,351 --> 01:02:31,512
Wasn,t it Le Corbusier who said,

879
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,655
,,Nothing is so Iike a man
as another man,,?

880
01:02:34,856 --> 01:02:36,255
I beIieve so.

881
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:40,485
This is where we observe
our ModeI CoupIe.

882
01:02:40,695 --> 01:02:42,322
If you pIease.

883
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:46,928
A typicaI day

884
01:02:47,135 --> 01:02:48,693
for our coupIe..

885
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:51,873
They usuaIIy get up at 7..20

886
01:02:52,073 --> 01:02:53,802
and go to bed at 22..45.

887
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,402
Seventeen minutes for reading,

888
01:02:56,811 --> 01:02:58,369
1 hour 47 minutes for TV.

889
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,105
Jean-MicheI works
9 hours 1 2 minutes.

890
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:04,615
CIaudine does housework
for 3 hours 1 7 minutes a day.

891
01:03:04,819 --> 01:03:08,118
They have intercourse
3.6 times a week.

892
01:03:08,323 --> 01:03:11,019
CIaudine attains orgasm

893
01:03:11,226 --> 01:03:12,887
one out of 3. 7 times.

894
01:03:13,094 --> 01:03:17,053
Jean-MicheI suffers from premature
ejacuIation 13-/- of the time.

895
01:03:17,566 --> 01:03:19,158
Very good!

896
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:23,360
But we,ve gathered
other vitaI data as weII.

897
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:27,103
For exampIe, the minimum
threshoId of happiness,

898
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:31,040
,,The Psycho-SociaI Happiness ModuIar,,
as we caII it here,

899
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:33,474
is Iower than first beIieved.

900
01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:37,743
CeiIings couId be eight inches Iower
without noticeabIe difference.

901
01:03:37,953 --> 01:03:43,084
On a 15-story buiIding,
that,s two extra fIoors at no added cost.

902
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:46,419
We,re against high-rises.
You know that.

903
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:50,962
I didn,t return to France
to feeI Iike I,m in Chicago!

904
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:54,299
It,s just one exampIe.

905
01:03:54,502 --> 01:03:59,030
Of course, there are high-rises,
and then there are high-rises.

906
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:01,505
We must think the unthinkabIe.

907
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:06,204
The French don,t trust technoIogy,
and maybe they,re right.

908
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:09,773
But us?
Watch out!

909
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:14,419
Yes?

910
01:04:14,623 --> 01:04:17,057
The minister is coming.
We need to search the area.

911
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:20,285
- Security.
- Come in.

912
01:04:26,268 --> 01:04:28,600
- I,II go Ieft, you go right.
- Yes, boss.

913
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:33,437
You idiot!

914
01:04:34,142 --> 01:04:36,042
Oh, it was you!

915
01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:37,871
It,s nothing, buddy.

916
01:04:38,113 --> 01:04:40,513
- What,s going on?
- Go see.

917
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,744
The door, for God,s sake!

918
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:49,285
Can,t take any risks, you know.

919
01:04:51,426 --> 01:04:53,087
They,ve made a reaI mess!

920
01:04:53,295 --> 01:04:55,024
And the minister,s coming!

921
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:56,424
Hurry up, sweetie!

922
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:58,792
What shouId I do, honey?

923
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,401
The experiment has aIready Ied
to a few discoveries.

924
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:03,764
Like what?

925
01:05:03,972 --> 01:05:06,736
For exampIe, peopIe
wiII happiIy accept

926
01:05:06,941 --> 01:05:09,466
apartments with windows
on onIy one waII,

927
01:05:09,678 --> 01:05:13,978
and windowIess kitchens
and bathrooms.

928
01:05:14,182 --> 01:05:17,083
And everybody eats everything
on one pIate these days,

929
01:05:17,285 --> 01:05:20,982
so 16-inch kitchen sinks
are more than sufficient.

930
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:23,749
Good. Send me your report.

931
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,448
Thank you.

932
01:05:25,927 --> 01:05:28,828
It,s important to question
conventionaI wisdom,

933
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,897
but rigid systemization
must be avoided.

934
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,797
Our housing poIicy
must Iook beyond

935
01:05:36,004 --> 01:05:39,872
mere financiaI viabiIity.

936
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:44,541
This is a pubIic service.

937
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:46,571
Of course, but -

938
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:48,544
My dear feIIow,

939
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:52,277
we must reconciIe
Man and the City.

940
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:57,383
For the New Man, we must create
a city to match his stature!

941
01:06:00,495 --> 01:06:02,554
- After you, Mr. Minister.
- Go on, GoIdberg.

942
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:06,293
Mr. Minister!

943
01:06:11,272 --> 01:06:13,365
You shouIdn,t have!

944
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,237
Perhaps we couId -

945
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:19,345
PIease, come in.

946
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:25,908
Go ahead.

947
01:06:26,121 --> 01:06:29,488
The minister is about to enter
the ModeI Apartment!

948
01:06:29,691 --> 01:06:32,057
I see a bouquet
behind the minister.

949
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,321
He,s giving it to CIaudine.
Everything,s going great!

950
01:06:36,765 --> 01:06:39,461
I think Jean-MicheI
is a bit intimidated.

951
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:41,225
No, now he,s suggesting

952
01:06:41,436 --> 01:06:43,233
they go in the Iiving room.

953
01:06:43,438 --> 01:06:45,463
WouId you Iike a cocktaiI?

954
01:06:45,673 --> 01:06:49,200
Very kind,
but if you don,t mind, ma,am,

955
01:06:49,411 --> 01:06:51,777
why don,t we get down
to business?

956
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:53,675
Of course. Excuse me.

957
01:06:56,584 --> 01:07:01,044
Let,s see now.
The minister wiII sit to my right.

958
01:07:01,256 --> 01:07:02,348
And Mr...

959
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,682
Mr. GoIdberg on my Ieft.

960
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:10,255
- May I go?
- CertainIy.

961
01:07:10,465 --> 01:07:12,763
I think we can be seated.

962
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:18,295
Excuse me.

963
01:07:18,506 --> 01:07:21,134
Don,t get up.
I,II get the food.

964
01:07:28,216 --> 01:07:30,150
She,s very impressed.

965
01:07:30,852 --> 01:07:33,548
But why?
There,s no reason.

966
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,286
Video techs, couId you -
There!

967
01:07:38,493 --> 01:07:41,223
CIaudine is in her ModeI Kitchen.

968
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:44,227
There,s a probIem
with the video Iink.

969
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:47,424
I think CIaudine turned off
her mike by mistake.

970
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:52,038
There, the Iink is back.
Such a beautifuI effect!

971
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:56,271
Then I aIways add
a touch of miIk.

972
01:07:56,945 --> 01:08:00,437
There! For a weII-bIended mixture,

973
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:03,412
I use this IittIe device.

974
01:08:04,219 --> 01:08:08,178
And with that we,II take
our Ieave of CIaudine.

975
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:12,519
Join us in 30 minutes
for their dinner with the minister!

976
01:08:13,828 --> 01:08:16,456
- It Iooks deIicious.
- May I serve you?

977
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:18,757
With pIeasure. What is it?

978
01:08:18,967 --> 01:08:21,561
Crayfish bisque,
but it,s not -

979
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:23,236
I,m sure it is! Thank you.

980
01:08:23,438 --> 01:08:26,430
- Mr. CoIbere?
- GoIdberg. Is it from a can?

981
01:08:26,641 --> 01:08:28,734
You know, they onIy toId us
at the Iast minute...

982
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:32,174
My stomach,s upset.
I,II have just a bit.

983
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,439
You,re not bored here?

984
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:38,244
We don,t have time to be
with aII our work.

985
01:08:38,453 --> 01:08:40,751
Besides, aII the tests
are very interesting.

986
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:43,287
Yes, it,s aII scientific.
Fascinating!

987
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:48,155
You,re doing us a great service,
and we,re very gratefuI.

988
01:08:49,497 --> 01:08:51,727
Where do you spend
your vacation?

989
01:08:51,933 --> 01:08:52,922
This year?

990
01:08:53,134 --> 01:08:56,365
No, in generaI.
Do you Iike to traveI?

991
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:59,734
We adore it.
I suppose you,re aIways -

992
01:08:59,941 --> 01:09:01,568
Yes, I traveI aII the time.

993
01:09:01,776 --> 01:09:03,175
You too?

994
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:06,712
Last year we went to SiciIy,

995
01:09:06,915 --> 01:09:09,008
the CefaIu CIub Med.
Ever been there?

996
01:09:09,217 --> 01:09:11,583
- I,ve never been to SiciIy.
- I have.

997
01:09:11,786 --> 01:09:14,277
It wasn,t bad.

998
01:09:14,923 --> 01:09:17,016
The G.O.s can get
on your nerves.

999
01:09:17,225 --> 01:09:20,217
But the day trips were great.

1000
01:09:21,396 --> 01:09:24,832
ReaIIy great,
Etna and aII that.

1001
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:27,831
At the CIub they had a song...

1002
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:33,398
just a siIIy oId tune,
but hoId on.

1003
01:09:35,043 --> 01:09:41,607
There are G. O.s
aII over CefaIu-oo-oo

1004
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:48,250
In aII the worId
never a sea so bIue-oo-oo

1005
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:53,355
- Nice!
- Yeah, but after a whiIe -

1006
01:09:53,561 --> 01:09:56,724
I can imagine, CIaudine.
May I caII you CIaudine?

1007
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:58,330
Of course.

1008
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:03,368
TeII me, when you were chosen
as the ModeI CoupIe,

1009
01:10:03,571 --> 01:10:05,163
how did you feeI?

1010
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:07,807
Happy.
Right, Jean-MicheI?

1011
01:10:08,009 --> 01:10:11,103
- About what?
- About being chosen.

1012
01:10:11,312 --> 01:10:13,542
I guess.

1013
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:15,715
At first he didn,t want to.

1014
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:19,683
She fiIIed out aII the forms.
I knew nothing about it.

1015
01:10:19,887 --> 01:10:23,880
So you were sure
you,d be chosen?

1016
01:10:24,092 --> 01:10:27,255
Not reaIIy, but I Iike contests.

1017
01:10:27,462 --> 01:10:30,090
And sure, I thought,
,,Why not us?,,

1018
01:10:30,298 --> 01:10:31,856
Of course.

1019
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:35,593
- WouId you Iike more?
- No, thanks. It was exceIIent.

1020
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:38,169
Then I,II cIear these away.

1021
01:10:38,373 --> 01:10:41,069
His mother was against it too.

1022
01:10:41,275 --> 01:10:43,573
- His mother?
- Yes.

1023
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:46,403
- Why?
- Oh, you know,

1024
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:49,675
she and CIaudine don,t reaIIy -

1025
01:10:53,287 --> 01:10:55,312
The guests have finished
the first course,

1026
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:59,857
and CIaudine is back in the kitchen.
We,II try to get the video feed.

1027
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:01,926
Pheasant with peaches!

1028
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:10,861
Excuse me.
I,II just put this here.

1029
01:11:11,072 --> 01:11:14,940
Jean-MicheI, you carve.
Take away the feathers.

1030
01:11:15,143 --> 01:11:18,010
WouId you mind heIping me?
- Not at aII.

1031
01:11:20,114 --> 01:11:23,174
I,II take the carving board.

1032
01:11:24,686 --> 01:11:27,246
Sorry.
The carving knife.

1033
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:30,390
I,II put that here. Perfect.

1034
01:11:40,702 --> 01:11:44,365
Sorry!
What was I thinking?

1035
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:47,504
AII right.

1036
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:50,333
Can you manage, honey?

1037
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:55,175
Here,s CIaudine. She,s carrying
what Iooks Iike a veaI roast

1038
01:11:55,383 --> 01:11:58,318
with green beans
and ChatouiIIard potatoes.

1039
01:11:58,519 --> 01:12:02,046
What? Sorry!
I,m toId it,s roast pheasant

1040
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:05,191
with peaches and cherries.

1041
01:12:05,393 --> 01:12:07,520
The minister is carving!

1042
01:12:07,729 --> 01:12:09,629
A beautifuI shot!

1043
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:15,632
TeII me...

1044
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:19,434
what is your ideaI future?

1045
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:23,038
Let,s do our own IittIe test.

1046
01:12:23,945 --> 01:12:27,745
Imagine you,re the minister
and you have unIimited power -

1047
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:31,316
which I certainIy don,t!
No, thanks.

1048
01:12:31,919 --> 01:12:33,682
What wouId you do?

1049
01:12:36,591 --> 01:12:39,754
- You go.
- No, you start.

1050
01:12:40,495 --> 01:12:42,224
WeII...

1051
01:12:43,397 --> 01:12:48,391
no one wouId work.
Everything wouId be computerized.

1052
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:51,094
That way, we,d have time
to do things.

1053
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:55,401
We couId Iearn, think, Iove.

1054
01:12:56,144 --> 01:13:01,946
There,d be no more frontiers,
no more wars,

1055
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:05,415
no more prisons,
no more hunger,

1056
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,815
no more rich,
no more poor.

1057
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:11,014
No more government.

1058
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,421
We,d be happy, you know?

1059
01:13:14,629 --> 01:13:18,190
It won,t happen overnight, of course.
What do you think?

1060
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:21,163
I think we,II aIways work,

1061
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:24,338
and as for the government,
I,m afraid that -

1062
01:13:24,806 --> 01:13:26,501
My dear CIaudine,

1063
01:13:26,707 --> 01:13:29,835
I wish you couId do aII that,

1064
01:13:30,511 --> 01:13:35,278
but you know, even though
I may seem Iike an optimist,

1065
01:13:36,184 --> 01:13:38,948
the future worries me.

1066
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:42,350
To me, onIy one thing matters:

1067
01:13:42,557 --> 01:13:46,254
Does mankind want
progress or happiness?

1068
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:50,194
We can,t have both.

1069
01:13:50,731 --> 01:13:53,291
May I have some more?
- Of course.

1070
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:55,730
You see...

1071
01:13:57,705 --> 01:14:01,436
I,m a pessimist
who hasn,t Iost aII hope.

1072
01:14:01,642 --> 01:14:03,701
That,s IoveIy!

1073
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:07,813
I fight with aII my strength
not to give up.

1074
01:14:08,015 --> 01:14:11,178
What about technoIogy?
Don,t you think -

1075
01:14:11,385 --> 01:14:15,287
No, neither technoIogy
nor poIitics.

1076
01:14:16,057 --> 01:14:18,457
OnIy Man.
- That,s it.

1077
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:20,126
Man.

1078
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:24,262
If Iogic cannot save us,

1079
01:14:24,465 --> 01:14:28,993
we shaII go beyond Iogic
to find Man,

1080
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:31,671
or rather, Woman.

1081
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:34,767
When I say Man,
I incIude Woman:

1082
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:40,073
intuition, tenderness,
practicaIity, the protector of Iife.

1083
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:42,672
AII that sounds great,

1084
01:14:42,884 --> 01:14:48,686
but we struggIe just to pay
aII our taxes and fees -

1085
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:53,384
Yes, but if socioIogists,
ecoIogists, economists, poets,

1086
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:56,688
and statesmen,

1087
01:14:56,898 --> 01:15:01,926
with the heIp
of average men and women,

1088
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:05,663
sought a new viewpoint,
a common dream,

1089
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:09,036
we might just have a chance!

1090
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:15,671
More wine?

1091
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:17,316
I,d Iove some.

1092
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:19,853
Me too.

1093
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:21,544
And now...

1094
01:15:24,558 --> 01:15:27,118
I speak to you
as your minister.

1095
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:34,357
Like everyone,

1096
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:37,469
you have fears,
questions, doubts.

1097
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:38,705
No, no fear.

1098
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:43,639
Admit it!
You often wonder what to do.

1099
01:15:43,844 --> 01:15:45,573
WeII, yeah.

1100
01:15:46,213 --> 01:15:48,238
You put your faith in me,

1101
01:15:49,016 --> 01:15:50,881
and it,s my duty to answer you.

1102
01:15:51,152 --> 01:15:53,450
It,s not that we -

1103
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:58,591
We must first end infIation
and then create new jobs.

1104
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:02,126
ExactIy. And fight injustice.

1105
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:04,958
Yes, but...

1106
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:06,300
how?

1107
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,398
ExactIy.

1108
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:11,128
By supporting economic growth,

1109
01:16:11,339 --> 01:16:14,968
heIping businesses,
protecting workers,

1110
01:16:15,176 --> 01:16:17,337
and reducing sociaI inequaIity.

1111
01:16:17,545 --> 01:16:18,239
ExactIy.

1112
01:16:18,446 --> 01:16:19,970
That,s aII?

1113
01:16:20,181 --> 01:16:23,309
Of course not.
There are detaiIs to work out,

1114
01:16:23,517 --> 01:16:26,953
pIan, organize, and resoIve,

1115
01:16:27,621 --> 01:16:30,283
but with your heIp!

1116
01:16:31,092 --> 01:16:32,719
That,s wonderfuI!

1117
01:16:32,927 --> 01:16:36,158
I,ve heard you can bend spoons.

1118
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:38,888
I certainIy can.

1119
01:16:39,433 --> 01:16:41,765
WeII, it depends.

1120
01:16:41,969 --> 01:16:43,937
It doesn,t aIways work.

1121
01:16:44,138 --> 01:16:47,164
It depends on the atmosphere

1122
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,843
and energy currents.

1123
01:16:51,112 --> 01:16:53,945
Here, hoId this spoon.

1124
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:26,104
I can feeI it moving!

1125
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:34,380
I think...

1126
01:17:34,588 --> 01:17:36,783
That,s right.
,,I think...,,

1127
01:17:44,765 --> 01:17:48,394
- I,II get the dessert.
- Need heIp?

1128
01:17:48,602 --> 01:17:50,661
Don,t worry,
I can do it myseIf.

1129
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:54,238
I Iove heIping out.

1130
01:17:58,145 --> 01:18:00,113
Give me your gIass.

1131
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:11,321
- Why,d you give me your gIass?
- You asked me to.

1132
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:14,622
Stand up.

1133
01:18:17,631 --> 01:18:20,828
That,s submission to authority.

1134
01:18:21,035 --> 01:18:22,662
It,s a serious matter.

1135
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:26,738
Taken too far,
it Ieads to Auschwitz!

1136
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:32,277
I did tests in the New York subway.
You know what the subway is?

1137
01:18:33,114 --> 01:18:35,412
The French caII it Ie Metro.

1138
01:18:36,183 --> 01:18:40,176
I toId my team
to ask passengers

1139
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:42,378
to give up their seats.

1140
01:18:42,857 --> 01:18:45,758
My team was hesitant
and didn,t want to,

1141
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,951
but I got mad, so they went.

1142
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:50,221
Know what happened?

1143
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:54,234
- The passengers refused?
- No, they got up.

1144
01:18:54,869 --> 01:18:58,066
Interesting experiment, isn,t it?

1145
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:01,203
- I don,t know.
- Stay standing!

1146
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:05,810
Just kidding!

1147
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:08,743
- A FIoating IsIand!
- And champagne!

1148
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:10,917
What,s going on?

1149
01:19:11,152 --> 01:19:13,848
- It,s him.
- What is?

1150
01:19:14,054 --> 01:19:14,952
Sit down.

1151
01:19:15,156 --> 01:19:16,919
Remain standing!

1152
01:19:17,391 --> 01:19:19,359
I,ve had about enough of this!

1153
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:22,586
- Okay, fine. Sit.
- I,II do what I want!

1154
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:24,696
Did you two fight?

1155
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:26,890
Just a IittIe experiment.

1156
01:19:27,101 --> 01:19:29,035
You and your experiments!

1157
01:19:29,236 --> 01:19:32,467
PIease, Jean-MicheI,
don,t get upset.

1158
01:19:32,673 --> 01:19:34,971
Dr. GoIdberg certainIy
didn,t mean to -

1159
01:19:35,176 --> 01:19:38,475
Sit down and Iet,s have dessert.

1160
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:45,885
Let,s sing!

1161
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:49,852
How did that song
from your vacation go?

1162
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:51,285
It goes...

1163
01:19:51,492 --> 01:19:55,451
There are G. O.s
aII over CefaIu-oo-oo

1164
01:19:55,663 --> 01:19:56,789
Sing, Jean-MicheI!

1165
01:19:56,997 --> 01:19:59,295
I,ve sung enough.
You sing.

1166
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,240
Don,t you Iike it?

1167
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:17,713
Sure. But how about:

1168
01:20:18,352 --> 01:20:22,254
The repubIic caIIs upon you

1169
01:20:22,456 --> 01:20:26,483
Victory for
the red, white, and bIue!

1170
01:20:26,694 --> 01:20:31,154
A Frenchman Iives for his country

1171
01:20:31,398 --> 01:20:35,425
And for her he wiII die!

1172
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:40,000
StiII awake?

1173
01:20:40,774 --> 01:20:42,241
No.

1174
01:20:43,244 --> 01:20:45,075
What,s wrong?

1175
01:20:45,646 --> 01:20:48,342
Nothing. Everything,s fine.

1176
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:52,384
Is it me?
What,d I do now?

1177
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:55,453
Nothing at aII.
Everything was fine.

1178
01:20:55,656 --> 01:20:58,420
You were perfect, wonderfuI.

1179
01:21:00,261 --> 01:21:01,956
What an evening!

1180
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:05,130
I was on edge.
I drank too much.

1181
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,730
,,Sing, Jean-MicheI!,,

1182
01:21:10,437 --> 01:21:13,895
You never miss a chance
to make me Iook stupid!

1183
01:21:14,108 --> 01:21:16,576
- You know that,s not true.
- It isn,t?

1184
01:21:18,078 --> 01:21:19,375
Is there a probIem?

1185
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,275
Get Iost or I swear -

1186
01:21:21,482 --> 01:21:25,145
Jean-MicheI, CIaudine,
answer us.

1187
01:21:25,686 --> 01:21:27,415
Don,t answer.

1188
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:30,189
Be quiet.

1189
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:32,351
We,re here.

1190
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:36,620
Is there a probIem?
That,s what we,re here for.

1191
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:41,027
Answer.

1192
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:42,829
Answer!

1193
01:22:35,723 --> 01:22:38,283
And now Iet,s sing!

1194
01:22:38,492 --> 01:22:41,484
,,May I caII you CIaudine?,,

1195
01:22:48,502 --> 01:22:50,902
Your country caIIs upon you

1196
01:22:52,005 --> 01:22:54,803
Victory for
the red, white, and bIue!

1197
01:22:57,077 --> 01:22:59,511
I,II die for my country!

1198
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:07,243
,,When I say Man,
I incIude Woman.,,

1199
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:08,785
,,ReaIIy?,,

1200
01:23:09,022 --> 01:23:12,480
,,Jean-MicheI, sing CefaIu-oo-oo!"

1201
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:23,702
We,re the ModeI CoupIe!
That,s aII we are!

1202
01:23:23,904 --> 01:23:25,929
My name,s CIaudine!

1203
01:23:26,373 --> 01:23:27,601
Mine,s Jean-MicheI

1204
01:23:32,413 --> 01:23:34,347
- We normaIize
- We anaIyze

1205
01:23:34,548 --> 01:23:36,038
- We inspect
- We dissect

1206
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,047
- Sympathetic!
- Pathetic!

1207
01:23:38,252 --> 01:23:42,712
We are unique!

1208
01:23:44,091 --> 01:23:45,115
- We are
- Guinea pigs

1209
01:23:45,325 --> 01:23:46,257
- We are
- Not vain

1210
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,825
Humane!

1211
01:23:52,065 --> 01:23:56,525
We,re the ModeI CoupIe!

1212
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:04,977
You know, we didn,t
get paid this month.

1213
01:24:05,179 --> 01:24:06,874
You,re right.

1214
01:24:08,315 --> 01:24:11,842
What,s more,
they withheId 90,000 francs

1215
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:15,488
from the 280 of my saIary.
That can,t be right.

1216
01:24:15,923 --> 01:24:21,122
Another thing I can,t stand
is that I,m paid Iess than you.

1217
01:24:22,196 --> 01:24:24,096
That too.

1218
01:24:24,932 --> 01:24:29,926
We can,t stand for this.
I,m gonna taIk to them tomorrow.

1219
01:24:30,137 --> 01:24:31,627
Me too.

1220
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:41,607
They won,t get away with this.

1221
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:50,119
What is it now?

1222
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:53,384
You know what time it is?
Is this another test?

1223
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:55,255
Yes, a new experiment.

1224
01:24:55,462 --> 01:24:59,057
You,re being heId hostage
by ruthIess revoIutionaries.

1225
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:00,824
- That,s us.
- You?

1226
01:25:01,034 --> 01:25:02,695
You work for the Center?

1227
01:25:02,903 --> 01:25:04,928
Like I said, it,s a new test.

1228
01:25:05,138 --> 01:25:07,402
You,re fed up, right?

1229
01:25:07,608 --> 01:25:09,007
- Yes!
- Okay.

1230
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:11,143
We,re changing things.

1231
01:25:11,345 --> 01:25:14,405
We,II pretend to be terrorists
and take you hostage.

1232
01:25:14,648 --> 01:25:18,607
Tomorrow they,II caII in the cops,
TV cameras, the whoIe deaI.

1233
01:25:18,852 --> 01:25:22,754
We,II demand air time on TV
in exchange for your freedom.

1234
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:24,617
It,II be reaIIy cooI.

1235
01:25:24,825 --> 01:25:27,885
You,re just kids! You reaIIy
work for the Ministry of the Future?

1236
01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:29,528
Sure! We,re the future!

1237
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:31,960
- Does that surprise you?
- Nothing surprises me now.

1238
01:25:32,165 --> 01:25:33,792
Get up, both of you.

1239
01:25:34,001 --> 01:25:38,028
UnpIug the camera.
You get the TV. You, the speakers.

1240
01:25:39,406 --> 01:25:41,874
I stiII don,t understand.

1241
01:25:42,109 --> 01:25:45,772
- What don,t you understand?
- This whoIe thing.

1242
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:49,506
With the recession, interest in
Future Cities and ModeI CoupIes is fading,

1243
01:25:49,716 --> 01:25:52,241
so if TV audiences
think you,re in danger,

1244
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:56,855
they,II be outraged and forget
about aII the rest. A cIassic tactic.

1245
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,626
For 1 2 hours, the ModeI Apartment has
been occupied by terrorist commandos

1246
01:26:00,827 --> 01:26:02,795
hoIding the ModeI CoupIe hostage.

1247
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:06,591
What do these gangsters
hope to gain?

1248
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,098
The Minister of the Future,
after a sIeepIess night,

1249
01:26:09,303 --> 01:26:10,827
admits that he,s heIpIess.

1250
01:26:11,038 --> 01:26:12,938
,,They,re armed,,, he decIared.

1251
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,904
,,They,ve got grenades,
and they,re ruthIess!,,

1252
01:26:16,109 --> 01:26:17,269
Excuse me.

1253
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:20,241
It,s Jean-Pierre Antoine.

1254
01:26:20,647 --> 01:26:23,047
What,s going on?
Can we get a video Iink?

1255
01:26:25,018 --> 01:26:30,479
HeIIo, Hubert de BonaIoi?
This is Jean-Pierre Antoine.

1256
01:26:30,691 --> 01:26:34,354
I,m here with a camera crew
outside the apartment

1257
01:26:34,561 --> 01:26:38,292
where CIaudine and Jean-MicheI
are being heId hostage.

1258
01:26:38,498 --> 01:26:39,795
You read me?

1259
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,298
We read you Ioud and cIear.

1260
01:26:42,502 --> 01:26:45,266
Good. As I was saying,

1261
01:26:45,472 --> 01:26:49,738
for the Iast 12 hours,
the Center has been hoIding its breath.

1262
01:26:49,943 --> 01:26:52,309
As has aII of France!

1263
01:26:52,512 --> 01:26:55,447
But who are these terrorists?
What do they want?

1264
01:26:55,649 --> 01:27:00,109
UnfortunateIy
we don,t know at this time.

1265
01:27:00,687 --> 01:27:01,654
Wait!

1266
01:27:01,855 --> 01:27:04,824
I see a terrorist, a femaIe.

1267
01:27:05,025 --> 01:27:07,118
ProbabIy their spokesman.

1268
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:09,124
I,II ask the cameraman
to fiIm her.

1269
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:11,229
TeII him to adjust the exposure.

1270
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:13,956
Adjust the exposure.

1271
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:16,330
HeIIo, terrorists!

1272
01:27:16,536 --> 01:27:20,666
Do you hear me? What do you want?
Why cause this nightmare?

1273
01:27:20,874 --> 01:27:23,502
You,re the nightmare, butt-face!

1274
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:26,804
We,re sick of workers, sIums
and working for crumbs!

1275
01:27:27,014 --> 01:27:28,379
This is your Iast warning:

1276
01:27:28,582 --> 01:27:30,846
Stop your buIIshit
or we,II bIow it aII to bits!

1277
01:27:31,051 --> 01:27:31,779
They,ve got bombs!

1278
01:27:31,985 --> 01:27:33,043
What,s the situation?

1279
01:27:33,787 --> 01:27:37,348
It,s cIear that CIaudine
and Jean-MicheI are hostages.

1280
01:27:37,557 --> 01:27:42,119
They,ve been kidnapped,
imprisoned, taken hostage.

1281
01:27:42,329 --> 01:27:45,560
LegaIIy, this is a very tricky situation.

1282
01:27:46,299 --> 01:27:49,166
Two things can happen:

1283
01:27:49,369 --> 01:27:53,066
If they,re reIeased
after Iess than four days,

1284
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:57,039
their assaiIants risk
15 years in prison,

1285
01:27:57,244 --> 01:28:00,543
but if the hostages are heId
for more than four days,

1286
01:28:00,747 --> 01:28:06,344
their assaiIants
couId receive Iife in prison.

1287
01:28:06,553 --> 01:28:08,282
But this isn,t a normaI situation!

1288
01:28:08,522 --> 01:28:12,083
We,re not judging aduIts
who,ve kidnapped chiIdren,

1289
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:15,784
but chiIdren
who,ve kidnapped aduIts!

1290
01:28:15,996 --> 01:28:18,294
ChiIdren who,ve kidnapped aduIts!

1291
01:28:18,498 --> 01:28:19,795
That changes everything.

1292
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,834
Existing Iaw
doesn,t address such a case.

1293
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:29,065
FrankIy, I don,t see
a judiciaI soIution.

1294
01:28:29,276 --> 01:28:32,837
Something,s happening.
Do you read me?

1295
01:28:33,046 --> 01:28:35,844
They,re going to Iet us
see the ModeI CoupIe.

1296
01:28:36,049 --> 01:28:39,348
There they are!
It,s the CoupIe!

1297
01:28:41,488 --> 01:28:43,581
ModeI CoupIe, how are you?

1298
01:28:44,458 --> 01:28:48,792
We,ve been treated weII,
but we,re very tired!

1299
01:28:48,995 --> 01:28:51,930
It stinks in there!
The toiIets are cIogged!

1300
01:28:52,132 --> 01:28:53,224
The horror!

1301
01:28:53,433 --> 01:28:57,233
Terrorists, take me hostage
and reIease the ModeI CoupIe.

1302
01:28:57,437 --> 01:28:59,166
Chief, no!

1303
01:28:59,372 --> 01:29:01,806
Enough buIIshit!
We want action!

1304
01:29:02,008 --> 01:29:05,876
We want an hour of air time!
Got that?

1305
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:09,173
An hour of air time or eIse!

1306
01:29:09,382 --> 01:29:11,009
Let,s go.

1307
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:14,247
Hear that?
Anger,s running high,

1308
01:29:14,454 --> 01:29:17,753
but with Iives at stake,
we must keep it in check.

1309
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:21,052
I,m speaking with Chief Bayard,

1310
01:29:21,294 --> 01:29:23,990
who, for the Iast 12 hours,

1311
01:29:24,197 --> 01:29:26,028
has shown incredibIe composure.

1312
01:29:29,503 --> 01:29:31,164
Bravo! IncredibIe!

1313
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:33,771
You shouId,ve seen it!
They were shitting their pants!

1314
01:29:33,974 --> 01:29:36,169
You were great.
I aImost cried.

1315
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:40,870
You were perfect.
Superb.

1316
01:29:41,081 --> 01:29:44,346
- Imagine what your parents wiII say!
- You smoke?

1317
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:47,076
Kids grow up fast these days.

1318
01:29:48,355 --> 01:29:50,346
- Got a Iight?
- Here.

1319
01:29:56,496 --> 01:29:59,090
HoId on.
The chief of poIice.

1320
01:30:00,433 --> 01:30:02,060
Yes, it,s me.

1321
01:30:02,836 --> 01:30:04,428
Okay.

1322
01:30:04,638 --> 01:30:07,971
How Iong? Are you nuts?

1323
01:30:08,642 --> 01:30:10,769
Yeah. AII right.

1324
01:30:12,345 --> 01:30:14,210
When wiII it be aired?

1325
01:30:14,648 --> 01:30:17,276
And no funny stuff.
We don,t budge tiII we see it.

1326
01:30:17,484 --> 01:30:20,715
And we want a getaway car.

1327
01:30:22,222 --> 01:30:25,055
A Porsche.
No, a Mercedes.

1328
01:30:25,258 --> 01:30:27,226
- A RoIIs!
- A tank!

1329
01:30:27,427 --> 01:30:29,987
- Okay, bye.
- WeII?

1330
01:30:30,197 --> 01:30:33,860
A TV crew,s coming.
It,II air tonight.

1331
01:30:35,001 --> 01:30:36,127
CooI!

1332
01:30:36,336 --> 01:30:37,894
How much air time?

1333
01:30:39,005 --> 01:30:40,666
Three minutes.

1334
01:30:40,874 --> 01:30:42,466
Just three?

1335
01:30:42,676 --> 01:30:46,772
Programming confIicts.
We,II be on after the news.

1336
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,005
That,s prime time.

1337
01:30:49,916 --> 01:30:54,376
Just three minutes!
We better think what to say.

1338
01:30:54,588 --> 01:30:57,182
We,II give ,em heII!

1339
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:01,287
Check it out.

1340
01:31:02,696 --> 01:31:04,994
- Who,s there?
- TVcrew.

1341
01:31:05,932 --> 01:31:07,729
The TV crew, guys!

1342
01:31:07,934 --> 01:31:09,799
That was fast!

1343
01:31:10,704 --> 01:31:12,228
AII right!

1344
01:31:12,505 --> 01:31:13,665
HeIIo.

1345
01:31:17,878 --> 01:31:19,607
The terrorists.

1346
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:22,805
What,s the pIan?

1347
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:28,182
First, we expIain why we,re here.

1348
01:31:28,955 --> 01:31:32,288
Second, we expose
this entire operation,

1349
01:31:32,492 --> 01:31:35,290
and third -

1350
01:31:35,695 --> 01:31:38,186
Right. Where do we set up?

1351
01:31:38,398 --> 01:31:41,128
Stay there.
ModeI CoupIe, stand next to me.

1352
01:31:41,334 --> 01:31:44,201
CIear the tabIe.
JuIien, shut the door.

1353
01:31:46,473 --> 01:31:51,433
Nobody wants to hear speeches,
so we,II do something reaIIy cooI.

1354
01:31:51,645 --> 01:31:54,045
- What do we do?
- HoId on.

1355
01:31:55,115 --> 01:31:57,208
Can you beIieve this mess?

1356
01:31:57,417 --> 01:31:58,816
- Ready?
- RoIIing.

1357
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:01,110
Terrorists, take 1 .

1358
01:32:02,722 --> 01:32:06,818
Here,s the big moment
you,ve been waiting for, foIks.

1359
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:10,793
Sorry, no big desk and fIag,
but I,m speaking from the heart.

1360
01:32:10,997 --> 01:32:13,522
Let,s meet the gang.
I,m Pierrot.

1361
01:32:13,733 --> 01:32:16,566
This is JuIien and Georges,

1362
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:20,228
and you aIready know
CIaudine and Jean-MicheI.

1363
01:32:21,274 --> 01:32:22,536
This is CharIotte,

1364
01:32:22,742 --> 01:32:25,233
Vincent and Frederic.

1365
01:32:25,445 --> 01:32:27,470
What was I gonna say?

1366
01:32:27,681 --> 01:32:31,208
Think about the TV you,re watching.
Whose is it?

1367
01:32:31,418 --> 01:32:37,789
OnIy two or three knobs work,
and the station chooses what you see.

1368
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:40,459
You never Iook inside it.

1369
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:44,061
Try to take it apart
and it,II bIow up in your face!

1370
01:32:44,264 --> 01:32:46,698
Same for your apartment.

1371
01:32:46,933 --> 01:32:50,391
You think you own it,
but your ceiIing is the fIoor upstairs,

1372
01:32:50,603 --> 01:32:53,231
the waIIs are
your neighbors, waIIs!

1373
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,340
You got screwed!

1374
01:32:55,575 --> 01:32:59,841
Your apartment was soId twice,
and it,s Iike that with everything.

1375
01:33:00,046 --> 01:33:02,446
So? So you own nothing.

1376
01:33:02,649 --> 01:33:05,243
You,ve got nothing to Iose,
