1
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,584
Well, that's that then.

2
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,422
Let's get a cab.
I can't face the walk.

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,512
Situated on
the outskirts of the city

4
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,722
on the first day
of a weeklong series

5
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,724
of special reports from Iraq

6
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:10,144
to mark the fifth anniversary
of the Allied invasion.

7
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:13,481
Five years on we've commissioned
the most comprehensive survey

8
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:16,109
of the Iraqi people
ever undertaken,

9
00:01:16,318 --> 00:01:17,819
and it seems
like the nation

10
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:20,738
is deeply pessimistic
about the future.

11
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:24,242
The people are concerned
over the continued rise in violence

12
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,661
and about the remaining
deep divides

13
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,000
in their society.

14
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,585
Garvey's here.

15
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,423
Hey, big Bill!

16
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,301
Can't keep a good man down,
can they?

17
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,720
- Nice to see you, mate.
- Yeah, you too.

18
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:45,805
Karl, make us some tea,
will you?

19
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,515
I've gotta get out
of this monkey suit.

20
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,142
Eh, full acquittal
though, yeah?

21
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,602
- Get in! Come here.
- Thanks, man.

22
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:54,314
I knew it was bollocks. They'd never
make that stick, would they?

23
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:56,232
It's a fucking waste
of the taxpayers' money.

24
00:01:56,442 --> 00:01:58,985
Tell you what, it should be legalized
anyway, shouldn't it?

25
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:00,903
- Yeah. Anyway, do you want some tea?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:04,240
Maggie, would you make
Garvey some tea, please?

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,174
Oh!

28
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:26,012
Jesus Christ, it's like
a fucking noose!

29
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,473
Undo the knot.
Come here.

30
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,809
- You're just tightening it.
- Fucking get it off me, man!

31
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,437
Calm down.
Just let us have a look.

32
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:47,700
How long has
he been here, Maggie?

33
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,828
- He's had a sandwich.
- The disgusting fat locust.

34
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,414
He's not fat.
He's got big bones, Bill.

35
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,208
Well, he's peasant stock,
isn't he?

36
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:59,796
Now, you know, it's all beer
and armchairs and TVs,

37
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:02,507
and they're just a load of slobs.
It sickens me.

38
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,551
His dad was a moron
as well.

39
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:08,096
Good to see
a friendly face.

40
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:10,181
I thought I'd pop in,
make sure you're all right.

41
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,559
Tough four months
for you boys, I'd imagine.

42
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,812
I just thought I'd come
and put your mind at rest.

43
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:19,023
Everything's
running smoothly.

44
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,025
I knew it was
all in safe hands.

45
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,653
Well, I'll pop
to the little boys' room.

46
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:25,947
Hey, you've put on
a bit of weight there, Garv.

47
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:29,367
- I don't think so.
- I think you're getting a little bit heavier.

48
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:32,370
Yeah, I can see it on the sides...
like handles.

49
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,747
Right, thanks.

50
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,296
Hello, Eric.

51
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:45,550
Thanks.

52
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,053
- - Boys.
- Eric.

53
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,848
- - They gave you cake for the way out, did they?
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,100
- - All right, Eric?
- - Yeah, I'm all right. You?

55
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:56,477
- Yeah, not too bad now.
- Looks like a slab of concrete.

56
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:58,688
Yeah. Ah, it's all right.

57
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:01,274
A little bit stale. Taste's a bit
like petrol, but it's okay.

58
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:04,694
Looks like a dog's crapped on it.
Look at it.

59
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,696
I quite liked it.

60
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,865
- I thought it was all right.
- Oh, it's all right.

61
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,700
If you swill it down
with enough tea,

62
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:12,660
it'll be getting there,
you know.

63
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,121
Well, don't break
your teeth on it.

64
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,499
- Where'd you get it?
- I got it from the shop at the end of the road.

65
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,210
- Those Pakis are thieves, man.
- You shouldn't say that...

66
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,254
Pakis... anymore,
should you?

67
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:26,924
- What's someone from Afghanistan?
- Uh, Afghani.

68
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,260
- There you go.
- Yeah, that's true.

69
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,762
- - Brain of Britain.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:34,474
This needs
painting over, Maggie.

71
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:37,977
Yeah, everything's
a mess here.

72
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:41,606
We can't be too conspicuous.
That's the golden rule.

73
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:46,402
I wouldn't want a new house.
They've always got problems.

74
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:49,822
You can't trust builders.

75
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:53,576
This situation needs sorting out,
tidying up.

76
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:57,538
Yeah. Like someone
close in, obviously.

77
00:04:57,748 --> 00:04:59,707
Yeah.

78
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:01,709
Well, it's an informant
culture, isn't it?

79
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,712
- Listen, about that money...
- Don't worry about that now.

80
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:07,632
- That's good of you, Garv.
- That's all right.

81
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,301
- I'll sort it out next week.
- No sweat.

82
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,595
- I'll bring it round to your house.
- Or down the club.

83
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:16,557
- Yeah, okay. Thanks, man.
- It's only money, isn't it?

84
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,103
- - Any beer about?
- - Only what you brought, mate.

85
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:23,272
I thought this was meant
to be a big party.

86
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:26,442
Well, I'll pop down the offy.
Who wants what?

87
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:31,405
Get us some whiskey,
some wine and some beer.

88
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:33,157
And some matches
or a lighter.

89
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,368
- No, a lighter.
- All right.

90
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:37,453
- Okay.

91
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:42,500
Oh, fuck's sake.

92
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,173
Where's Garvey getting
the booze from?

93
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,717
- - Just the offy over the road.
- - Valda's coming round.

94
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,928
- - Who's coming over?
- - Valda's coming round.

95
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,847
Ah. That's his new bird.

96
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,642
- - Is it?
- I've been going out with her for a year.

97
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:02,103
He's not been going out
with her for a year at all.

98
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,397
How long have you
actually known her?

99
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:06,983
- I haven't seen her in about six months.
- He hasn't seen her.

100
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:10,611
- How long did you go out for?
- About a year... 10 months.

101
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,364
I thought I heard
she done one.

102
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,783
She did, but she just rung up.
She's coming round.

103
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:18,995
Maybe she's pregnant.

104
00:06:19,204 --> 00:06:21,872
Yeah, that's...

105
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,375
that's extremely unlikely.

106
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,377
I fast for January.

107
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:30,298
No to poisons, no to drugs,
no food.

108
00:06:30,507 --> 00:06:32,049
I only allow myself tea.

109
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,093
- - And whiskey.
- - Fucking hell, Bill.

110
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:38,514
- I feel like a teenage tantric Superman.
- Yeah, so do I.

111
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:40,474
I'm a simple person.

112
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:43,185
I like to reconnect
to the essentials.

113
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,689
Go on.
Come on.

114
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,816
Come on, Eric,
you're strong,

115
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,484
you big-boned bastard.

116
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,445
This is like tempered steel.
Come on.

117
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:54,238
You do it to me,
then I'll do it to you.

118
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,365
- - Come on!
- Bad-tempered steel.

119
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:58,618
Come on, Eric,
I'll let you have a go.

120
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:01,495
- Come on, then.
- Let's have it.

121
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,918
- Looks like a crossover.
- Go on, take a dig.

122
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,379
- Take a fucking dig, Eric!
- Feel that.

123
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:13,466
- It's soft as shite.
- Oh, you bastard!

124
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:16,677
I forgot to pick
the kids up.

125
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:19,847
- - Oh, a man out of time.
- - Shit.

126
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:21,807
What's happened?

127
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:23,559
Oh, that's them
outside now.

128
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,353
I'd better go.

129
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,815
Who's out there?

130
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:32,234
- - It's his missus.
- - Is she coming in?

131
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:33,736
No no no.
I'd better go.

132
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,321
I gotta feed the kids
and that, but...

133
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,114
Is that Helen?
I ain't seen her in years.

134
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,699
Yeah yeah.
We gotta go.

135
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,701
Well, uh, nice one.
Well done and everything.

136
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:42,328
- Yeah, well done.
- Cheers, Garv.

137
00:07:42,537 --> 00:07:44,205
Yeah, see you later.

138
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,082
See you, Maggie.

139
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:49,669
See you, everyone.

140
00:07:49,878 --> 00:07:51,796
Cheers, Garv.
Have a good one, mate.

141
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,631
She looks
absolutely furious.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,675
Give 'em a kiss
for me, Garv.

143
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:58,010
She's fit...
his missus, mate.

144
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,722
- Hoo-hoo.
- That's his old missus.

145
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:04,850
His new missus is like
a hippo-croco-pig.

146
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:12,108
- - A bit shortsighted.
- - Looks a bit like him in a lady mirror.

147
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:16,862
A female version of Garvey.
Can you imagine it?

148
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:19,156
Give us one of those beers.
Oh, these are from Garvey.

149
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,784
- - Good old Garvin, eh?
- Yeah, cheers.

150
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:25,162
- - What a little superstar.
- He's shaken 'em up, hasn't he?

151
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,290
He's totally fucking
depth-charged me.

152
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,044
Why don't you just pour it
over the carpet?

153
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,464
- Karl. Oi.

154
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:38,217
- Yeah? Hello, mate.
- Come here, I've got something to show you.

155
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:41,512
- Hold on a second.
- By the way, when are you coming back to work?

156
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,556
Soon. Just got to be
a bit careful, that's all.

157
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,182
Well, you need
to hurry up.

158
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,851
I'm running round
like a blue-ass fly.

159
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,061
This thing don't
run itself, you know?

160
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,188
- Everything's going all right though, yeah?
- Yeah.

161
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,607
A bit of trouble in Whitehawk,
but otherwise shway shway.

162
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,568
- Sweet.
- Come on out.

163
00:08:55,777 --> 00:08:58,487
I've got something
to show you.

164
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:00,740
You are coming back
to work, aren't you?

165
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:03,826
Yeah, I told you. I'm coming in.

166
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:07,538
So I don't have to run this whole
bloody operation by myself.

167
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,040
Get in there. I've got something
to show you.

168
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,293
- They're not gonna come up, are they?
- Doubt it.

169
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:16,714
Oh, fucking hell! It's gone right through
the lining on my jacket.

170
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,592
- What's that, Eric?
- A fucking gun, mate.

171
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,510
- Got it off Don the Gun.
- Fuck off.

172
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,637
That looks
totally real, man.

173
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:27,725
It is fucking totally real..
What are you talking about?

174
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,769
- You serious?
- It's a real gun, yeah.

175
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,980
I just bought it for 200 quid.

176
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:36,692
Are you serious?
This is a real shooter?

177
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,527
Yeah, it's a real shooter.
I just bought it.

178
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:41,572
I just told you.
I need it, don't I?

179
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,076
- What, you never seen a fucking gun before?
- Eric, Eric,

180
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,828
are you out of your
fucking mind, mate?

181
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,580
What?

182
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,792
- Put it away and take it home.
- All right, all right.

183
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,919
Well, he's not going
to see it, is he?

184
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,338
I've just got my... I've just got
my prints all over a gun.

185
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,590
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What are you, paranoid or what?

186
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,884
What do you mean?
I've just come back from court.

187
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,303
- (laughing) Oh, for Christ's sake, mate.

188
00:10:04,513 --> 00:10:06,931
- What's up with you?
- Has this been fired?

189
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,350
Don't know.
Didn't ask.

190
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,185
Mate...

191
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,312
Look, give it to me.
I'll do that.

192
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:15,898
- Come on...
- No, I'll do it. Thanks very much, Eric.

193
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,151
It don't mean the old Bill
are going to come

194
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:21,362
straight round now,
are they?

195
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,159
Put it away.
I don't want to see it again.

196
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,623
Was he always such
an unctuous little prick...

197
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,667
fucking Garvey?

198
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:37,378
I'll say he's pretty consistent.
Why?

199
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:40,172
I can't believe the old man's left him
running that fucking club.

200
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:41,882
He's making
a fortune, man.

201
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:43,926
I mean, he's just moved
into some flash new drum.

202
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:46,220
Well, that should have
me and you on it.

203
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,347
What can you say?
Bill is Bill.

204
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:51,433
- How's he holding up?
- A bit rattled, I'd say.

205
00:10:51,643 --> 00:10:53,644
- Minor.
- What about you?

206
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:57,064
Fine. I'm just trying
not to think about it.

207
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:58,816
You know I'm right
behind you, don't you?

208
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,985
What, leading from the rear, yeah?

209
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,489
I've got
your back, mate.

210
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,286
Where's Garvey?

211
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,915
If Benson had testified...

212
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:18,961
It's all right, mate.
Calm down.

213
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,046
It's all sorted.

214
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:23,340
There you go.

215
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,885
Oh, hang on. Here.

216
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:29,138
- All right. Thanks, Karl.
- How you holding up?

217
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:38,439
Well, they've shown their hand now,
haven't they?

218
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,441
Yeah, we're home and dry
now though, right?

219
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,193
Are we?

220
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,946
I feel like I've been fighting this corner
forever, mate.

221
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,200
40 years...
not a bad run.

222
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,997
Oh, it was a run, was it?

223
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,291
I mean, I was a smoker.

224
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,211
I mean, I was a...
I was an artist, a poet.

225
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,590
- The head.
- I was a head, you know.

226
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,593
And I said I would do it.

227
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:09,219
I started doing it

228
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,514
and I could have
as much gear as I wanted,

229
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:14,099
which was all
I was interested in.

230
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,101
The funny thing was...
this is what I noticed

231
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:18,354
first of all
when I got into it...

232
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:23,025
was everybody else was into
making money, except me.

233
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:25,819
I mean, me and Timothy Leary,
you know.

234
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:29,573
I believed that this was a revolution
of consciousness

235
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,451
and there was gonna be
an evolution taking place.

236
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:34,912
And we were gonna find out
all these discoveries

237
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,873
about the brain
and the future

238
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,626
and how to be high
and stay high

239
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:45,297
and how to be magical, how to live
in the world in this sort of new way.

240
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,758
But all these other characters
basically were into bread.

241
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,095
They made money and I
ended up just becoming

242
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,639
just another criminal like them
because of force majeure.

243
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:55,724
Because of Maggie and then
you and the rest of it,

244
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:57,685
I had to do something.

245
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:58,936
You know?

246
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,480
Studied the "Tibetan
Book of the Dead."

247
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,441
I learned how to control
my consciousness when I got into acid.

248
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,859
I knew how to sort of...

249
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:07,945
I did the full lotus,

250
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,739
where you can get into
that little pyramid shape.

251
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:14,868
And then it all starts to unfold,
you know, and curl up.

252
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:18,372
It goes out the top of your head
and there you are, man.

253
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,708
And you're like,
"Hey, I'm God.

254
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:23,502
I am all men.
I can be Everyman.

255
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:26,588
I'm no better,
no worse...

256
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:28,924
certainly no worse than anyone else
in the world.

257
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,760
I am Man.
I am Adam Kadmon."

258
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,597
Three things... that's what I found
at the top level.

259
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,641
You know what?
It's a triangle.

260
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,811
It's goodness,
truth and beauty.

261
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,355
And if things
aren't good,

262
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,441
they're not true
and they're not beautiful.

263
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,068
If it's good, it's also true
and beautiful.

264
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,695
And that was the aim...

265
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:54,491
to get that little triangle
in your forehead

266
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,995
so you could see through
that lens of goodness, truth and beauty,

267
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,373
and see the goodness and see
the truth and see the beauty.

268
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,917
I've just become some sort of,
you know, grim recluse

269
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:05,544
living in my diamond cave.

270
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:09,131
There were good drugs
to start with,

271
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,758
and then the freak-out
of the laws

272
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,384
and the paranoia began.

273
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:14,053
And everybody
splintered off

274
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:16,388
and went into their rooms
and closed their curtains.

275
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:19,683
And the communities
were all closed off from one another

276
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,602
so nobody knew
what anybody else was doing.

277
00:14:21,811 --> 00:14:23,187
Everybody else
was just paranoid.

278
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,149
You're only as good
as the people you're with.

279
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:30,736
Yeah, I know.

280
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,782
Okay, lads,

281
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,201
double bubbles all round.

282
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,661
Yeah.

283
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:10,901
What are we gonna
do then, Bill?

284
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:13,904
Well, we're gonna find out
who's behind all this.

285
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:25,916
âª She is the little
queen of spades âª

286
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:29,294
âª And the men will not
let her be âª

287
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:36,677
âª Hmm, she's the little
queen of spades âª

288
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:40,013
âª And the men will not
let her be âª

289
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,478
âª Every time she makes
a spread âª

290
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:51,233
âª Hoo, fair brown, cold chill
just runs all over me. âª

291
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,367
- Oh, all right. How you doing?
- All right, Bill?

292
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:02,411
Good result, eh?

293
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,371
What's the point of you
being on the inside

294
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:06,331
when you don't
help us out, Dave?

295
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,209
I'm only
a counselor, Bill.

296
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:12,087
Look, I done
all I could.

297
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:14,214
You've been
well lucky this time.

298
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,800
Have we?
It doesn't feel like we have.

299
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,554
So have you any idea
where all this has come from?

300
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:22,973
Nobody specific.

301
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,184
But it's someone close in.

302
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,019
You don't get paid
to speculate, David.

303
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:28,520
You get paid
for intelligence.

304
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,814
The police have got
this document.

305
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:34,860
I've told you, it's like a family tree
with it all mapped out.

306
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:37,154
And it's well
comprehensive, Bill.

307
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,281
All kinds of people
are on it, mate.

308
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,034
It goes right back
to your grandfather.

309
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:44,411
It's basically
the complete fucking picture.

310
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:45,746
I doubt that.

311
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:49,291
The Barneses,
the Cowells,

312
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,376
the Pikes...
they're all on it, mate.

313
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:53,212
All their marriages
back and forth.

314
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:54,755
Well, that's all
public knowledge.

315
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:56,256
So? What can they prove?

316
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:58,926
They don't have to
prove anything, do they?

317
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,136
Listen to me, Bill.

318
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,138
They've just got
to look at you

319
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:04,932
and eventually
something happens.

320
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:06,516
They know
it'll balance out.

321
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,478
Well, maybe they need
balancing out.

322
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,731
In the next life, yeah.

323
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:50,644
- Oh, lovely.

324
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,234
Fuck!

325
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,078
- Give me a minute, that's all.
- Okay.

326
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:12,040
My God.

327
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,875
You've put on a bit of weight,
ain't you?

328
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:15,836
For God's sake,
Bill, she's...

329
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,838
- You're gonna be a granddad, Bill.
- What?!

330
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:21,008
I've heard of sudden death,
but sudden birth?

331
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:24,094
Where's all this
come from, Karl?

332
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,305
Just...

333
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,237
When were you
gonna tell me?

334
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:44,239
I'm telling you now.

335
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,325
My dad's downstairs.
My mom is downstairs.

336
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:48,827
He's fucking loving it.

337
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:52,122
I'm never... I'm never gonna
hear the end of this. This is...

338
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:56,001
- I don't think your dad is the biggest problem here.
- Oh, come off it.

339
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:00,464
Just give me a second.

340
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,427
This is quite a number.
This...

341
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:16,646
I must be going
through a bad phase.

342
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,610
Maybe a baby's the thing
to pull me out of it.

343
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,738
I don't know.
Who fucking knows?

344
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,160
Or this kid's
gonna make it...

345
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,162
this kid's gonna
make it worse.

346
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,374
How does he know this one?
I get confused.

347
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:38,794
They was pen pals last time he was in prison.

348
00:19:39,003 --> 00:19:41,129
How do you go to prison
for assault

349
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,131
when you're the one
that's assaulted?

350
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,300
Well, you know,

351
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,178
it was that
unreasonable force thing.

352
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,889
That other lad's
still not right.

353
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:54,476
- He's not ready.
- What's that, Granddad?

354
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,853
Granddad to a bastard.

355
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,940
- Is there a word for that?
- Cunt.

356
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:18,542
Those letters you wrote me in prison
were really nice.

357
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,378
Good.

358
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,213
I've got some...

359
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
I've got some
just here.

360
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:28,301
- You can do a live reading.
- (laughs) Okay.

361
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,229
They were just here.

362
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,648
- Doesn't matter.
- Fuck.

363
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:45,110
They were just
fucking here.

364
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,654
- It's okay. It doesn't matter.
- It's... it's not okay.

365
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:49,865
Somebody's moved them.

366
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:53,785
Where the fuck are they?

367
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:56,455
They were just fucking here.

368
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,750
Oh, for fuck's sake!

369
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,171
- Fuck!
- There's some letters down here.

370
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,883
- They might be down here.
- They're not down... they were fucking here, man!

371
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,802
- It's okay.
- It's not okay, it's fucked!

372
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:15,223
It's fucking typical.
It's fucking fucked right up.

373
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,980
Mom!

374
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:25,192
Mom...

375
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:35,327
Mom! Mom!

376
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:37,871
Mom, have you seen
those letters?

377
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,000
- Calm down. It's okay.
- It's not okay!

378
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:45,045
Oh, there they are.

379
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:50,842
I never knew you liked
reading so much.

380
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:53,470
This is all just shit
we sell on eBay.

381
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,472
Oh, I see.

382
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,516
Do you like Hitler?

383
00:21:57,725 --> 00:22:00,602
A rare book
about him here.

384
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:04,231
That's Hitler's dog,
Blondie,

385
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,316
the Alsatian.

386
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:08,527
Got poisoned.

387
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:13,156
Not really his fault,
but there you go.

388
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,575
That's war.

389
00:22:18,412 --> 00:22:20,664
- Oh, to you, son.
- Cheers, Dad.

390
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,875
I was thinking it's gonna be really nice
out there when you paint that room.

391
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:25,627
Yeah, it'll be lovely.
Come on, baby.

392
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:27,045
And maybe while
you're doing it,

393
00:22:27,255 --> 00:22:28,713
you could think about
doing in here.

394
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:30,840
Yeah, no, absolutely.
Yeah, sure.

395
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,009
- Would you like a whiskey, Valda?
- I'm pregnant.

396
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,719
Thanks anyway, Bill.

397
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:36,721
Oh well, I suppose
it's about time

398
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:38,348
we did pair off, isn't it?

399
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,392
- How old are you now?
- 27.

400
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:44,646
- Ah. And how old are you now, Karl?
- 34.

401
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:47,357
- Come on.
- Anyway, see you later.

402
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,568
Yeah.

403
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,154
Bye, sweetie.

404
00:22:54,782 --> 00:22:56,992
So... bye.

405
00:22:57,994 --> 00:23:00,245
The trap slams shut.

406
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:04,499
How do you know
it's your kid?

407
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,126
Fucking hell, Dad.

408
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:08,003
You don't wanna find
yourself bringing up

409
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:10,213
some other bloke's bastard.

410
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:14,217
Oh, f...

411
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,428
It's so typical.

412
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:19,389
Why do you have to be
so fucking negative?

413
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,394
- You are my fucking son.
- No, fuck you!

414
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,022
- You're lazy. You're a fucking bastard.
- Fuck you!

415
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:29,774
You don't know who the fuck she is
or where she's come from.

416
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:32,611
I went out with her for a year, Dad!
I know who she is.

417
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,322
- What else might she be keeping from us?
- That's fucking bullshit.

418
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,240
This is a critical period
at the moment.

419
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,243
I won't let you fuck it up
with this baby bullshit.

420
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:44,039
- What the fuck has it got to do with you anyway?
- Tell her to get rid of it.

421
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:48,251
- Oh!
- Bill, it's too late for that.

422
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:51,713
- - You've upset your mother now.
- Get in here.

423
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:01,139
âª You poor injured fair one âª

424
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:05,560
âª Your pardon I crave âª

425
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:09,648
âª How soon must
I follow you âª

426
00:24:09,857 --> 00:24:12,776
âª Down to the grave? âª

427
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,280
âª There is none but you,
fair one âª

428
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,617
âª To see that sad sight âª

429
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,911
âª And by her distraction âª

430
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,831
âª He died the same night. âª

431
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:30,043
Well, what's your
intuition about it?

432
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:31,795
Well, you know,
I'm not really involved

433
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,880
in that anymore...
sort of thing, Bill.

434
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,757
I'm kept pretty busy
at the club, you know.

435
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:38,134
I've got kids and that.

436
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:41,805
And to be honest with you,
I don't feel as comfortable with it physically

437
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,640
as when I was a bit younger.

438
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,142
You're getting fat. You don't
need to make excuses, mate.

439
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:49,813
- All right, yeah.
- You know?

440
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:53,900
You and my dad used to be proper terrors,
didn't you, back in the day?

441
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,778
Your dad was one
of my best mates.

442
00:24:56,987 --> 00:25:00,115
In fact, he was
my closest friend.

443
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:02,575
Yeah. I mean, your dad was...
I would say your dad

444
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:05,912
was the smartest
and the funniest man in town.

445
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:07,497
He was the one to beat.

446
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,333
- I miss him quite a lot.
- We all miss him.

447
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:14,170
What happened to your old man
was... was terrible.

448
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,714
I never got over it really.

449
00:25:15,923 --> 00:25:18,383
I'm still sick inside about that.

450
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,844
You know I think he was murdered,
don't you?

451
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:22,929
- Really?
- Yeah.

452
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:26,224
- I thought it was just a fire.
- Well, yeah.

453
00:25:26,434 --> 00:25:28,977
I sometimes think
I should avenge his death.

454
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:30,729
That's what I'm supposed
to do as the son.

455
00:25:30,938 --> 00:25:34,691
But is that bad that
I just don't want to?

456
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,651
Well, it's all
changed now, isn't it?

457
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,070
There are no fathers left,
or hardly any fathers.

458
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,866
All these fucking slags
living off the state like fucking parasites,

459
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,993
leaving all the men
in fucking rooms.

460
00:25:45,202 --> 00:25:48,204
- So where are the fathers to avenge?
- Yeah.

461
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:50,331
It's all gone, mate.
You know what I mean?

462
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:54,377
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But still...

463
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,713
- No, you're doing all right, you know?
- Yeah.

464
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:59,632
I mean, you were lucky
because you had a dad

465
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:01,593
that was, you know...
it was okay.

466
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:03,178
I had him
for a bit, yeah.

467
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,764
I mean, my fucking old man...
he died in his bed

468
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:08,558
and let me find him naked
and dead when I was 13.

469
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,894
Bloody hell.
That's terrible, Bill.

470
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,396
I'm still sick inside.

471
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,565
Never got over that.

472
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,317
- What a bastard.
- Yeah.

473
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,694
That's what dads do...
they die.

474
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:21,696
- You know?
- Yeah.

475
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:25,825
Well, anyway, I'll keep my ear out
about what happened.

476
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,410
Lots of people come
through the club.

477
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,537
Someone might
say something.

478
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:31,414
Well, if you hear
anything, mate,

479
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,291
just let Karl know...

480
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:37,337
- Of course, yeah.
...and I'll hear it.

481
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:40,131
- You're all right, son. You're all right.
- Cheers, Bill.

482
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:42,342
- Cheers.
- Yeah, no worries.

483
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:50,266
Cheers, Bill.

484
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,101
- Cheers, mate.
- Thanks a lot.

485
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,812
Cheers.

486
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,862
Garvey.

487
00:27:03,072 --> 00:27:06,449
Garvey?
That's left of field.

488
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,618
I don't like him...
never did.

489
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:12,038
He's too nice.
It's a weakness.

490
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:14,249
Being nice
is a weakness?

491
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,376
Don't be sentimental.

492
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,462
Who has the most to gain
by you going to prison?

493
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,048
There's a lot of people
who would gain.

494
00:27:22,258 --> 00:27:24,259
I don't trust him.

495
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,094
Didn't trust his father either,

496
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:28,513
and we know how that turned out.

497
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,515
Yeah, point taken.

498
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:33,184
It's him and his wife

499
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:36,563
and his kids.

500
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:40,608
The police love to get their claws
into idiots like that.

501
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:43,528
Oh, Garvey's all right.

502
00:27:43,737 --> 00:27:45,363
Based on what?

503
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:47,824
Well, you know, my instincts.

504
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,159
Yeah well, that's bullshit.

505
00:27:57,918 --> 00:28:00,670
We quite like
the name Enoch

506
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,423
or Norbert.

507
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:05,341
Norbert?

508
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,968
- It's all right.
- Look...

509
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:08,803
Unusual...
it's an unusual name.

510
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,014
It's medieval apparently.

511
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,892
- Bill is a good strong name.
- Bill?

512
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:17,228
Oh yeah, like,
no prejudice. Sure.

513
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:19,147
I don't know how Valda
would feel about that,

514
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:21,357
but I'm having a feeling
though that she probably

515
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,776
wouldn't like the idea
very much at all.

516
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:26,863
- Or Billina for a girl.
- Billina's not even a name.

517
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,073
Check the book. It's not in there.
I guarantee it.

518
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:33,328
I think you'll find the feminine version
of William is...

519
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,288
- It's Wilhelmina.
- Wilhelmina.

520
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:40,376
So it could be Billelmina,
or short... Billina.

521
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:44,672
How come there's no pictures
of me in this album?

522
00:28:44,882 --> 00:28:48,635
This is 1979. I should be all
over this album.

523
00:28:48,844 --> 00:28:51,095
I've told you
a million times...

524
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:52,764
photos were expensive
in those days.

525
00:28:52,973 --> 00:28:55,224
Now hang on a second.
There's loads of pictures.

526
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:58,978
There's loads of pictures of you two,
of this dog that I don't remember.

527
00:28:59,188 --> 00:29:01,189
And then...

528
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:05,818
I think that's my foot.

529
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:10,657
I never took any photos.

530
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,992
Well, somebody took
a lot of pictures.

531
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:15,745
It wasn't me.

532
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:29,550
- âª Are you going to... âª
- Is that my Gibson?

533
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,845
âª Are you going âª

534
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:35,974
âª To Scarborough Fair? âª

535
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:38,643
That guitar's worth
more than you are.

536
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:41,729
It's not a fucking Gibson!

537
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:45,149
Jesus, I gotta fucking listen to you play, like,
night and fucking day

538
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,360
the whole time with
your pals and whatnot.

539
00:29:47,569 --> 00:29:49,904
Why don't you learn some chords?

540
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,993
I mean somewhere else.

541
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:06,254
- Hey, Karl.
- Hi, Chris.

542
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:08,047
- You all right?
- How's tricks?

543
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:10,425
- Come in.
- Not too bad, mate. Not too bad.

544
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:13,302
- Good to see you two out and about, anyway.
- Can you close the door?

545
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,848
Hello. Hello.
How are you?

546
00:30:17,057 --> 00:30:18,808
- Oop!
- Where are we? In here?

547
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,560
- Out the back.
- All right.

548
00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:22,895
I'll leave this pram here in the hall.
Is that all right?

549
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:25,023
It's Chris Pringle.
Yeah, that's fine, mate.

550
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:27,025
It'll be safe enough,
won't it?

551
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:29,068
- - There you go.
- - Hello, Mr. Pringle.

552
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,112
- - How you doing? You all right?
- Yeah yeah.

553
00:30:31,321 --> 00:30:32,530
Good to see you two
out and about.

554
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,283
- I want Grandpappy.
- All right, sweetheart.

555
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:37,827
Grandpa.

556
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,996
- - Lovely, isn't he?
- Good boy.

557
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,082
- - Grandpa, Grandpa.
- How old's your boy now?

558
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:47,295
Um... three.

559
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:51,049
Ah, that's a nice age.

560
00:30:51,258 --> 00:30:54,594
- - Had his first fight the other day.
- Yeah?

561
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:56,471
- He's an indi...
- A little snapper.

562
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,306
He's an individual, is he?
Like his dad?

563
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:00,808
Yeah, twatted this kid
with a xylophone.

564
00:31:01,018 --> 00:31:02,310
- It was brilliant.
- Really?

565
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,853
Yeah yeah yeah.
So I'll show you that.

566
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,022
He twats him
with a xylophone

567
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,733
and I'd taught him the two fingers
into the throat routine, right?

568
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:10,860
So I'd seen his eyes go...
'cause he's got his dad's eyes.

569
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,071
The next minute, he's across the table
with a finger in...

570
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,239
"No!"
Pulls him back.

571
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,867
He's at him like he's a fucking junior ninja.
So they pulled him back.

572
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,161
I sees the look in the teacher's eyes, man.
He shat himself.

573
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,330
- - A brick in his underpants.
- Oi, Chris...

574
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:24,248
Chris, he looks
just like you.

575
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,958
Of course
he fucking does.

576
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,543
Yeah,
come on then, Kurt.

577
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,003
Do you want to help me
make the tea?

578
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,922
When I was out
in Bosnia, you know...

579
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:32,757
well, actually I went down
to have a holiday

580
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:34,801
and ended up just having
a go in the war.

581
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,886
- - Cheap beer.
- Were you in the army, Chris?

582
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,722
Which one?
Floated about.

583
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,558
Don't fight for no king,
no country... no queen, no country.

584
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:45,353
- - I'm my own principality. Know what I'm saying?
- Amen.

585
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:47,063
Yeah. Amen.
Testify, brother.

586
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,898
- You know the truth.
- Passport to Pringle.

587
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,900
- Huh?
- Passport to Pringle.

588
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,153
- What does that mean??
- Oh.

589
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:57,156
So I'm standing there in the court...

590
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:59,033
- ...and all of a sudden...

591
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:00,618
Less of that bit,
will you?

592
00:32:00,828 --> 00:32:02,328
- Sorry?
- Less of that.

593
00:32:02,538 --> 00:32:04,455
I don't mind the cuddling,
but none of the kissing

594
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:07,667
and farting noises,
all right?

595
00:32:07,876 --> 00:32:09,669
Just stay
where I can see you.

596
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,712
Play up and down the hall if you want.
That's fine.

597
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:15,174
But don't be taking him
into your other room or anything.

598
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:19,053
Listen, if youse boys
need anything done,

599
00:32:19,263 --> 00:32:21,639
just give me a shout,
won't you?

600
00:32:21,849 --> 00:32:25,184
- So...
- Hmm?

601
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:29,397
- Oh, of course. Don't worry.

602
00:32:29,606 --> 00:32:32,275
Got the car out the back...
hatchback.

603
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,318
A roll of carpet,
gaffer tape,

604
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:36,195
lump hammer...
it's all there.

605
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:39,448
Good to go.
Shovel, small handle.

606
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,659
Give me 15 minutes...
boom, South Downs.

607
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:44,287
- Good boy.
- All right?

608
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,247
Modern life
these days, you see?

609
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:48,666
- - You gotta market.
- You got a point there, Chris.

610
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:51,711
- Have you got a web presence?
- Not yet.

611
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,921
Listen, catch youse later,
all right?

612
00:32:54,131 --> 00:32:56,591
Nice to see you.
Keep it...

613
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,718
- keep it tight.
- Have a good one.

614
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:01,762
- Nice to see your kid as well, man.
- He's lovely, isn't he?

615
00:33:01,972 --> 00:33:03,347
He took to you,
didn't he?

616
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:05,349
Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.

617
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,977
- You gonna go with your dad?
- Is he up the stairs?

618
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,357
I was thinking about
having Valda round,

619
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:14,859
having a bit of dinner.

620
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:16,360
I suppose.
Maggie?

621
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,738
I haven't got much in.

622
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:21,657
I'll cook it.

623
00:33:22,743 --> 00:33:24,869
Yeah, fine.

624
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:30,041
- - Karl.
- - Yeah?

625
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,001
Look at this glass
you've just given me.

626
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:33,669
Say again?

627
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,047
Well, I'm not going
to say anything.

628
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:39,091
Would you mind
having a look at that?

629
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:40,801
It's fine.

630
00:33:42,596 --> 00:33:45,681
You know, this is the first time
I've come over for dinner.

631
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:49,018
Really? Hmm.
That was rude of us.

632
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,604
How long did you go out together?
About three weeks?

633
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:54,440
- A year.
- A year?

634
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,942
Is that right, Maggie?

635
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:58,569
- Was it that long?
- A year.

636
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,447
Oh, yeah. Well, what do you
see in him then?

637
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:03,282
What do you mean?
There's lots to see in him.

638
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:05,785
Dad, just...
Please, Dad, just...

639
00:34:05,994 --> 00:34:08,162
It's not an interrogation, yeah?
It's just...

640
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:14,043
To happy families,
all right?

641
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,170
Tonight at least.
Happy families.

642
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,214
- - Happy families.
- All right, okay.

643
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,800
- - Happy families.
- - Cheers, everyone. Cheers, Mom.

644
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:22,593
Do you need a hand?

645
00:34:22,803 --> 00:34:24,679
Oh, fuck.
Shit, fuck.

646
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:26,889
I don't really see
my parents much anymore.

647
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:30,101
- - Oh, why's that?
- - Personal reasons.

648
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:34,063
Ma, have we got a...
a thing for the pasta?

649
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:35,648
Oh, it's all right.
I found it.

650
00:34:35,857 --> 00:34:37,149
So he does a lot of cooking

651
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,026
around here then,
Bill?

652
00:34:39,236 --> 00:34:40,569
- No. He hardly ever cooks.
- Shit.

653
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,697
He's only cooking
because you're here.

654
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:45,700
It's very nice of him
to make the effort, isn't it?

655
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,160
Well, he can be
a good lad, yeah.

656
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,371
He's all right really.

657
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,206
Only the best tonight.

658
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,250
Do you know what this
is called, this pattern?

659
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,336
- Is it the willow?
- Yeah, it's the willow pattern.

660
00:34:57,546 --> 00:35:00,172
It's a story about
runaway lovers, isn't it?

661
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:01,966
Going over the bridge,
I think.

662
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:04,218
Is that right?

663
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,304
- Did they have a happy ending?
- I don't think so.

664
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:08,556
Oh, I think that's
what the birds are.

665
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:12,226
I think maybe that's the souls of the lovers
after they've been murdered.

666
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:14,562
What it is, I can tell you,

667
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:20,234
is the lovers...

668
00:35:20,444 --> 00:35:25,448
got chased
over the bridge by her dad,

669
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:28,534
who's the fisherman,
and he trapped them on the island

670
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,911
and broke down
the bridge.

671
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:34,498
They were trapped forever, but then
they turned into birds and they were free.

672
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,209
- He's a fountain of knowledge, isn't he?
- I never knew that.

673
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:40,963
- - Had those since our wedding... never knew.
- Ah.

674
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,591
- - Lovely.
- - Mm, you win 20p.

675
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,551
A bit of salad there, Mom?

676
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:49,221
Well, I can't say
that you're not pretty.

677
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:51,474
- - There he goes, the charmer.
- Thanks.

678
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,976
- - Yeah..
- Aren't you?

679
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,980
Well, you know,
if I was 20 years younger...

680
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,150
- - He was a devil.
- - It's more like 35 years younger, Dad.

681
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,986
Oh, all right,
35 years.

682
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,616
When he had hair.

683
00:36:08,825 --> 00:36:10,826
Karl, could you get me
some water, please?

684
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,121
Thank you.

685
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:17,541
I think your problem is you don't give Karl
enough credit.

686
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:19,960
That's not true.

687
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:23,089
Well, if I'm honest,
I think you bully him.

688
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:24,924
You just pick at him
all the time.

689
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:28,386
Pick pick pick.
You just get at him all the time.

690
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:31,097
Look, it's banter. You don't understand
how this house works.

691
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,640
I think I do.

692
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:35,017
- - Is she always this mouthy?
- What?

693
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,103
We can't all be
Father Christmas, can we?

694
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:41,065
- I'm just being myself, Karl, don't worry.
- Girls like you...

695
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:43,109
- pregnant...
- Dad.

696
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:44,610
I bet you don't
even know who by.

697
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,153
Karl, are you going
to say anything?

698
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:47,738
- - Dad...
- - Look...

699
00:36:47,948 --> 00:36:49,615
Dad, Dad!

700
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:52,410
Look, if she says it's mine,
it's mine, all right?

701
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,703
Mom...

702
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:58,499
You should
have known, Karl.

703
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,918
You should have known that
this was not a good idea.

704
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:04,046
I know, but she's got...
she's got my baby.

705
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:07,383
I've got a fucking
headache now.

706
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:11,095
Mom, listen, just...
please, can you just stop him?

707
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:13,347
- I'll be all right. Get back in there.
- Just help me.

708
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:16,225
I'll be all right
when I've had a drink.

709
00:37:19,646 --> 00:37:21,939
Beam me up.

710
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:33,868
Do you want
some help, Karl?

711
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:36,787
Yeah well, there's a bit of pudding.
I'll bring it in.

712
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:42,877
I thought there was
some vino coming.

713
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:44,795
No, I'll bring it in
in a minute, Dad.

714
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:47,214
Let me get the pudding sorted out,
get it ready to serve.

715
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:50,342
- Yeah, thanks, Maggie.
- I just wanted to have a look at you.

716
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:53,971
Yeah. Why was it
you and he split up then?

717
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:56,140
I don't know.

718
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:58,267
It just didn't work out.

719
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:01,520
Quite a lot of temper, fights.

720
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,523
But he seems to have,
you know, mellowed a bit.

721
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:06,775
Yeah, he's got
a temper on him,

722
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,277
but we're on top
of it now.

723
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,112
He got new pills.

724
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,323
What do you mean?

725
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:17,661
Well, he has a few mood swings,
doesn't he?

726
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:21,332
- But he's a lovely lad.
- He's... he is a lovely lad.

727
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:25,169
Good night.

728
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:28,255
- I'm sorry it was a bit harsh.
- Don't worry about it.

729
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:31,050
- It was entertaining.
- I'm sorry you didn't like the food.

730
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:32,927
It was fine.
It was fine.

731
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:36,305
It was very sweet
that you cooked.

732
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,766
I thought you were, you know,
on good form tonight.

733
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,976
I know.

734
00:38:49,402 --> 00:38:52,071
Okay, I'm gonna go.

735
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,948
- Give me a call.
- I will do.

736
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:55,449
- I'll see you out.
- Okay.

737
00:38:55,659 --> 00:38:58,327
What a fucking
little imbecile.

738
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:00,037
Not in front of the boy.

739
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:01,872
She's a sheep.
She's a follower.

740
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:04,291
I don't bully him.
It's non-aggressive advice.

741
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:07,294
Yeah, she's got
her hooks right in.

742
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:09,421
It's absolutely
typical of him.

743
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:12,341
- That was good rowdy fun, yeah?
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.

744
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,135
- It was good to see her again.
- Yeah, I'm really glad she's back.

745
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:18,639
Yeah. She should lay off
the fatuous advice, though.

746
00:39:18,848 --> 00:39:20,808
- You know?
- She was just telling it how she saw it.

747
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:22,309
Well, I think
she should keep

748
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,061
that internal monologue
to herself

749
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:25,771
and not share it
with the adults.

750
00:39:25,981 --> 00:39:27,982
I'm playing at devil's advocate
here, Karl,

751
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,776
but she's a bit,
you know, full of herself.

752
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:34,947
In a nice way, I mean.
Conceited.

753
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:39,785
I had a nice time.

754
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:31,754
Garvey'll be around
in a bit.

755
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,091
Hide the fucking pies, yeah?

756
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:39,553
- Where does your missus think you are?
- Late at the club.

757
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:41,972
I don't know why
I couldn't tell her what's happening.

758
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,433
I told you, it's so she can't be put
in a position later on.

759
00:40:44,643 --> 00:40:46,852
- And no phones.
- Yeah, I left it at home. Don't worry.

760
00:40:47,062 --> 00:40:48,562
- So what's going on?
- Nothing much.

761
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:50,397
Just tying up
a few loose ends.

762
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:56,362
- Was it you?
- What?

763
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:00,658
Fucking hell!
Are you mental?

764
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:02,951
I've done... I've done
fuck all to deserve this?

765
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,871
- Calm down.
- What's going on? You lure me out here...

766
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:07,915
- What's this?

767
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,551
Look, listen, I couldn't get a sitter.
Can we sort this out now?

768
00:41:19,761 --> 00:41:21,178
- Fuck's sake.
- Ears!

769
00:41:21,388 --> 00:41:23,681
Shit, that's Chris Pringle!

770
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,766
Calm down, lad.
It's nothing personal.

771
00:41:25,975 --> 00:41:28,977
- What the fuck's he doing here?
- An impartial observer.

772
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,396
Fuck that!

773
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:36,026
Come here,
you fat bastard.

774
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:46,328
- Bill, what's going on?
- Everything's okay, Maggie. Don't worry.

775
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:49,790
Yeah, it's just a bit
of boisterous fun, Ma.

776
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:53,752
- Put it through, Bill?
- No, don't break it down. It's Victorian.

777
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:56,505
So what have... what have youse got here?
Like, you got any tools?

778
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:58,549
Like a knife?
A knife would be good.

779
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:00,759
- You didn't bring anything?
- This is amateur hour.

780
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:03,345
- No, I was in a rush.
- Dude, what the fuck?

781
00:42:03,555 --> 00:42:06,056
- I've got a kid, you know.
- Are you on a fucking... you on a meter?

782
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:08,434
Even leaving the fucking house
is like a lifestyle choice.

783
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:10,394
You're like my fucking missus.

784
00:42:10,603 --> 00:42:12,771
I've got the fucking kid.
I've got to go to work with the kid.

785
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:14,690
Yeah. He's having
a kid as well.

786
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,317
Oh, are you?
You having a kid?

787
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:19,611
That's brilliant.
Congratulations, son.

788
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:21,780
Come on,
hug it up, bitch.

789
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,408
- Cheers, Pringle.
- Oh, man.

790
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:27,369
- Dude, what are we gonna do...
- Look, let's finish this amateur hour.

791
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:30,956
- Oh, fuck, yeah.
- Keep it down, man. He's in there.

792
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,459
Well, he knows
we're fucking out here.

793
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:36,628
- Let's flush him out.
- I don't want any...

794
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:38,505
Come out,
you little fucker.

795
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:40,340
I'm gonna come in there
and get you.

796
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,760
I'm gonna fuck you up the ass
and set your hair on fire.

797
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:45,345
- - Fuck off, Pringle.
- - I'm fucking sick of this shit.

798
00:42:45,555 --> 00:42:48,307
A little bit strong.
Come on, he's a mate.

799
00:42:48,516 --> 00:42:50,601
Look, sorry about that.
Sorry, all right?

800
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:55,731
Would little Kurt like some squash,
Christopher?

801
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,026
- Nothing artificial, Maggie. Thanks, though.
- Oh, okay.

802
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:01,862
- Are my vitamin supplements ready, Maggie?
- Yeah, come through.

803
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:03,989
- Come on, out.

804
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:07,451
- Come out, come out, wherever you are.

805
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,287
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

806
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:18,796
âª As I was a-walkin' âª

807
00:43:19,005 --> 00:43:23,300
âª Down by
the Royal Arsenal... âª

808
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:26,053
Come on, mate.

809
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:27,638
You'll have to come out
at some point.

810
00:43:27,847 --> 00:43:29,640
No, I won't.

811
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:32,684
You gonna spend the rest
of your life in there?

812
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:34,895
Maybe.

813
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:41,485
Come on, mate,
don't be a fucking helmet.

814
00:43:41,694 --> 00:43:43,529
Come on, this went far enough,
don't you think?

815
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:46,281
âª In white linen âª

816
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:51,245
âª And cold as the clay âª

817
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:56,708
âª So beat the drum slowly âª

818
00:43:56,918 --> 00:44:01,213
âª And play
your fife for him... âª

819
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:04,633
- He's right...
- I know, he's in there.

820
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:07,010
He's hiding in there.

821
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,055
Tell him you can see him.
Say, "I can see you."

822
00:44:10,265 --> 00:44:12,558
I can see you.

823
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,351
Oh, fuck's sake.

824
00:44:14,561 --> 00:44:19,606
âª Oh, whose life
was squandered âª

825
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:24,862
âª And another young soldier âª

826
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:29,199
âª Cut down in his prime. âª

827
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:37,916
What's taking him
so fucking long?

828
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:39,418
Shall we go
and see Mommy?

829
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:41,253
- Shall we go and see Mommy?
- Yeah.

830
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:44,172
- Yeah, come on. I've had enough.
- Mommy.

831
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:48,260
- Where's my mommy?
- Good luck to you.

832
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:51,305
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

833
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:54,474
This is an absolutely
disgraceful cock-up.

834
00:44:54,684 --> 00:44:56,476
Listen, I'm not
used to having him

835
00:44:56,686 --> 00:44:58,687
under my feet all frickin' day
when I'm doing a job.

836
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:00,397
You oughta
toughen up, mate.

837
00:45:00,607 --> 00:45:02,024
You've left me
right in the shit.

838
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:03,817
Is he still up there?

839
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:06,403
Oh, fucking hell.
Nice one, Pringle, you spastic.

840
00:45:06,613 --> 00:45:08,155
Fucking forget about it.
I'm outta here.

841
00:45:08,364 --> 00:45:10,365
Come on, love.

842
00:45:11,618 --> 00:45:15,454
- Yeah, cheers.
- That's lame.

843
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:19,374
Are you gonna wait this out?
My eyes are shutting.

844
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,418
I'm taking
my sleepers, okay?

845
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:24,713
- I don't want any noise.
- Yeah, night, Mom.

846
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:41,647
- Garv, are you coming out?
- No. Fuck off.

847
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:44,232
Mate, it's just
getting silly now.

848
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:48,153
Garv, I don't know what
you think we're doing, mate,

849
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:49,696
but you've got it
all wrong.

850
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:53,283
This has just...
this has just been a test.

851
00:45:53,493 --> 00:45:55,452
I've been nothing
but nice to you lot.

852
00:45:55,662 --> 00:45:58,580
Yeah, Garv, but it's, like,
been a test of character

853
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,791
and you've passed it, mate...
flying colors.

854
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,710
- It's all sweet now.
- Really?

855
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,545
Yeah, come down
and smoke the peace pipe.

856
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:08,256
We'll forget
all about this.

857
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:12,552
Garv, I swear
on my unborn kid

858
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:14,846
we're not going
to do anything.

859
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:17,933
- Is that fucking animal Pringle out there?
- Pringle's gone, mate.

860
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,395
I don't even know
what he was doing here.

861
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:24,064
All right,
I'm coming out.

862
00:46:26,693 --> 00:46:29,027
Come on,
you great lump.

863
00:46:29,237 --> 00:46:31,530
We never suspected you
for a minute, mate.

864
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:33,782
You're getting paranoid
in your old age.

865
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,993
Yeah, you are, Garv.

866
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:40,580
It's not him, is it?

867
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,290
I don't know.
I'm tired.

868
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,127
He reacted all wrong.
I'm good at reading people.

869
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:46,795
He made a run for it.

870
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,965
Not an unnatural response
in the circumstances.

871
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:52,134
No, I'm talking about
your general aura.

872
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:53,677
You know, he's a clown.
He's a fool.

873
00:46:53,886 --> 00:46:55,887
He's innocent.

874
00:46:56,097 --> 00:46:58,098
All right.

875
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:01,476
Garv.

876
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:06,940
- So you having a baby, eh?
- Yep.

877
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,901
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

878
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:12,529
I was trying for months
with Helen,

879
00:47:12,739 --> 00:47:15,157
but she had a problem
with her uterus.

880
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:17,451
- Well, I did not know that, Garv.
- I'll tell you what.

881
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,745
I want to ask you
something.

882
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:22,122
On the night the twins
were conceived

883
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:24,082
I made this, like,
roaring noise.

884
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:25,876
I'd never
done that before.

885
00:47:26,085 --> 00:47:28,837
- Did you make a noise?
- Fuck knows.

886
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,922
I don't know, but...

887
00:47:31,132 --> 00:47:33,425
So what's the name
of the lucky mom-to-be?

888
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:35,927
- Valda.
- Valda.

889
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:38,180
Valda Newland?

890
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:40,974
- Why? Do you know her?
- Yeah yeah.

891
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:43,894
She went out with my brother
a few months ago.

892
00:47:44,103 --> 00:47:46,271
- Really?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

893
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:48,899
They were pen pals
together.

894
00:47:49,108 --> 00:47:50,525
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

895
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:53,361
She's had loads
of pen pals from prison.

896
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:56,490
She's a... she's a lovely girl.
She's got a big heart.

897
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:58,784
Well done.

898
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:05,874
I'm painting tomorrow.

899
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,043
- What, in here?
- Yeah, all around.

900
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,420
- What color?
- Just white.

901
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,547
Oh yeah, nice.
Fresh start.

902
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:15,550
- Can you do me a favor for a second, Garv?
- Yeah, of course.

903
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,845
- Can you just hold this up?
- Right.

904
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:21,932
- Just there.
- Yeah.

905
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:24,142
Actually,
I'm pretty knackered.

906
00:48:24,352 --> 00:48:25,977
You couldn't do us a tea,
could you, Karl?

907
00:48:26,187 --> 00:48:27,813
- Yeah, sure.
- What time is it?

908
00:48:28,022 --> 00:48:29,731
I've got
the kids tomorrow.

909
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:32,651
Ah!

910
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,112
Fuck your kids.

911
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,122
Eric, it's Karl.
Yeah.

912
00:48:45,331 --> 00:48:47,916
Any chance you could
possibly pop over?

913
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:52,087
Yeah, I'm gonna need
your help with something.

914
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,422
Come the back way, yeah?

915
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,092
Wicked.
See you then.

916
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:07,853
âª 'Twas on one
summer's evening âª

917
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:11,815
âª All in the month of May âª

918
00:49:12,024 --> 00:49:14,943
âª Down by a flowery garden âª

919
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,529
âª Where Betsy did lay... âª

920
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:20,615
Fat sack of shit,
he's done my back in.

921
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:24,202
- Oh, fucking hell.

922
00:49:27,832 --> 00:49:31,042
Bill will have a full-blown fit
if he finds out about this.

923
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:34,504
- I just don't want to hear his voice.
- Don't worry about it.

924
00:49:34,714 --> 00:49:36,965
Tell you what, this is
a blessing in disguise.

925
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:38,884
For us anyway.

926
00:49:39,093 --> 00:49:41,386
Jesus Christ, there's probably
snakes in here.

927
00:49:41,596 --> 00:49:44,514
Yeah, we're gonna put another snake
in there in a minute.

928
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:46,349
Mate, the ground
is well too hard.

929
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,518
We are never gonna do this.

930
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:50,145
It's gonna take all day.

931
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,772
Stop your fucking whingeing
and get on with it.

932
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:55,025
I... what exactly
are you here to do?

933
00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:57,444
I'm here to help,
all right?

934
00:49:57,653 --> 00:50:00,113
- But you've only brought one shovel.
- Take a fucking turn!

935
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:02,282
It's not a fucking
two-man shovel, is it?

936
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:05,035
You take your turn,
then I'll take over.

937
00:50:05,244 --> 00:50:07,704
This is bollocks. We'll never get him
into this ground, mate.

938
00:50:07,914 --> 00:50:10,498
- We're just gonna have to leave him.
- We can't fucking leave him.

939
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,417
We'll just have to fucking think of
something else.

940
00:50:12,627 --> 00:50:15,003
You have a fucking go.
Get in there and dig up...

941
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,422
For fuck's sake.
You're fucking useless, you are.

942
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:19,883
Here's a bit of fucking
soft ground here.

943
00:50:20,092 --> 00:50:21,843
There's no fucking
soft ground in there.

944
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:23,637
Yes, there is.
It's fine.

945
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:25,263
Fucking coming out here

946
00:50:25,473 --> 00:50:27,432
to commune
with fucking nature.

947
00:50:30,186 --> 00:50:32,729
- Fucking hell.
- I don't know how you do this as a job.

948
00:50:32,939 --> 00:50:34,481
You're fucking
useless at it.

949
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,982
Christ on a bike.
Look at you.

950
00:50:36,192 --> 00:50:37,525
Jesus, mate,
hold the fucking gate.

951
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:40,987
I ought to fucking
knock you off, you ponce.

952
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:49,120
âª Are you leaving
for the country? âª

953
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:55,126
âª You say the city
brings you down âª

954
00:50:55,336 --> 00:51:00,548
âª Leave the iron clown
behind âª

955
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:05,262
âª And feel the circus
moving on âª

956
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:11,935
âª Are you leaving
for the country? âª

957
00:51:12,144 --> 00:51:17,774
âª I know a little
country town âª

958
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:22,279
âª Where dogs are sleeping
in the cold âª

959
00:51:22,488 --> 00:51:25,490
âª And the flagpole's
falling down... âª

960
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,159
I wonder if it's gonna be
a girl or a boy.

961
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:31,705
- What, your forthcoming progeny?
- Yeah.

962
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:34,374
Science suggests
it'll be a girl.

963
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:39,170
Why would it suggest that?

964
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,507
Because the man determines
the sex of the child.

965
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:46,636
So what diff...
what does that mean?

966
00:51:46,846 --> 00:51:50,098
- Well, you're that type.
- What type?

967
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:52,100
Well, the type
that science talks about.

968
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,811
What, the type of person
that only has girls?

969
00:51:55,021 --> 00:51:57,647
What, you think
I've only got girl sperm?

970
00:51:57,857 --> 00:52:00,775
Listen, man, you can't
argue with science.

971
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:06,197
Who'd call
their kid Misery?

972
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:12,996
Dad, that's the door.

973
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:17,917
Pa, that's the door.

974
00:52:21,547 --> 00:52:23,923
Oh, fucking hell.
Don't get up.

975
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,388
- All right, Karl.
- All right, Dave.

976
00:52:30,598 --> 00:52:32,474
- I hear you're getting married.
- That's right.

977
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:36,519
Ducked 10 years and ended up getting life, eh?

978
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:39,939
- All right, Bill.
- Hello, Dave.

979
00:52:40,149 --> 00:52:42,525
Garvey never went home
last night.

980
00:52:42,735 --> 00:52:44,361
Oh, yeah? Is that official?

981
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,863
Yeah. I've had his missus
on the phone to mine.

982
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:49,157
After one night?
He's on a short leash.

983
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:51,826
He never goes away,
does he?

984
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:54,412
So, uh, was he here?

985
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:58,208
- - No.
- Not seen him.

986
00:52:58,417 --> 00:53:00,210
Well, who was here
last night?

987
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:02,462
Just... just Pringle.

988
00:53:02,671 --> 00:53:05,298
Fucking hell.
Pringle.

989
00:53:05,508 --> 00:53:08,051
That's non-helpful.

990
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,763
Right well, look,
if you see Garvey,

991
00:53:11,972 --> 00:53:13,264
you get him to give me
a bell, yeah?

992
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:15,183
- - Sure.
- Sure, will do.

993
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,936
- Yeah, well, I...
- We'll see you later, man.

994
00:53:18,145 --> 00:53:20,355
I just don't want
his missus...

995
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:23,233
- Take it easy, Dave.
...scaring up a big search party.

996
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:27,112
I'll see you later.

997
00:53:27,321 --> 00:53:31,825
- Well, where do you think Garvey is?
- I don't know. He's...

998
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,995
I don't like this.

999
00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:38,790
Do you think Eric's
into much with Garvey?

1000
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:42,460
Eric owes Garvey money.

1001
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,879
Quite a bit, knowing Eric.

1002
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:47,966
Why? What's wrong?
What's Eric got to do with it?

1003
00:53:48,175 --> 00:53:51,136
Garvey's missing, that's all.
Nothing to worry about.

1004
00:53:58,644 --> 00:54:02,522
I think someone must have picked him up
between here and his drum.

1005
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:09,529
- I can't go to prison, man.
- I know.

1006
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:11,739
I'll never come out.

1007
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,750
It's a confessional
culture, man.

1008
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,335
People just can't
shut up.

1009
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:27,589
Pringle will go then, yeah?

1010
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:31,134
- But who has he told?
- He lives with his mom.

1011
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:33,803
The kid's with
his ex-missus.

1012
00:54:34,013 --> 00:54:36,181
It's unlikely he's gonna
say anything germane to her.

1013
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:38,725
Yeah, let's hope not, eh?
What do you think, Bill?

1014
00:54:38,934 --> 00:54:41,311
I don't know.

1015
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,313
Mags?

1016
00:54:43,522 --> 00:54:46,399
Pringle tells his war stories
to whoever'll listen.

1017
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:48,610
The mom's a notorious
chatterbox.

1018
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,029
Just to be safe then, yeah?

1019
00:54:51,238 --> 00:54:54,532
Okay.
This is on me then, yeah?

1020
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:58,161
I'll deal with Pringle
and his people.

1021
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,663
This is turning into
a right fucking massacre.

1022
00:55:00,873 --> 00:55:03,541
- Yay.
- What about the kid? He's got a kid.

1023
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:06,294
Yeah, the kid's about two.
He can't even talk, can he?

1024
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:08,379
I mean, what's going
to happen to the kid?

1025
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:10,965
He'll probably end up getting sent
to a decent school.

1026
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:14,928
Would you want Pringle
as your old man?

1027
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:17,222
Can't believe they've brought this
on themselves.

1028
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:19,641
They're so selfish.

1029
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,018
Disappearances
and accidents, Eric.

1030
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:23,520
No showboating.

1031
00:55:23,729 --> 00:55:27,232
Bill, come on.

1032
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,696
Here, Pa.

1033
00:55:33,906 --> 00:55:36,407
- - Cheers.
- To Garvey.

1034
00:55:36,617 --> 00:55:38,743
Garvey.

1035
00:55:40,496 --> 00:55:43,748
- - And Pringle.
- - Yeah, and Pringle.

1036
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:46,918
Pringle.

1037
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:49,587
- A shame about his kid.
- Yeah.

1038
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:53,132
Don't think about it.
I'm not.

1039
00:55:53,342 --> 00:55:55,134
Still...

1040
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:56,553
that's the way
it goes, isn't it?

1041
00:55:56,762 --> 00:55:58,846
A lot of children die.

1042
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,391
What time is it?

1043
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,476
What, now?

1044
00:56:03,686 --> 00:56:06,688
It's about 25 past 4:00.

1045
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:10,441
- Why, have you got an appointment?
- Nah, I was just wondering.

1046
00:56:19,285 --> 00:56:22,870
- It's just nice to be out of the house.
- Mm.

1047
00:56:25,207 --> 00:56:27,333
Sometimes don't you think
you could just walk

1048
00:56:27,543 --> 00:56:30,670
straight out into the sea
and never come back?

1049
00:56:33,716 --> 00:56:38,845
You're full of cheery little introspective
observations today.

1050
00:56:39,054 --> 00:56:41,639
What did you want to be
when you grew up?

1051
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:47,145
Nothing.

1052
00:56:47,354 --> 00:56:49,606
How much
do you love me?

1053
00:57:03,078 --> 00:57:05,580
Rah!

1054
00:57:07,499 --> 00:57:08,791
Oi, Pringle.

1055
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:10,752
- You all right, mate?
- How you doing?

1056
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,545
- I've got a little job for you.
- Oh, yeah?

1057
00:57:12,755 --> 00:57:14,339
- Yeah. You up for it?
- Yeah, nice.

1058
00:57:14,548 --> 00:57:16,299
Come on, mate.

1059
00:57:16,508 --> 00:57:17,925
Come on, jump in.

1060
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,636
It's lovely here, isn't it?

1061
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:21,721
- Stinks of shit, mate.
- Yeah.

1062
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,598
But I like those
fresh country smells.

1063
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:27,226
- You know what I mean?
- So what's this all about?

1064
00:57:27,436 --> 00:57:30,188
Just gotta see a geezer over here.
Don't worry about it.

1065
00:57:30,397 --> 00:57:33,024
- Whereabouts?
- Just over here.

1066
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:36,611
- By this caravan?
- No no, just by the side of the caravan.

1067
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,489
Nothing to worry about.
Don't worry.

1068
00:57:43,786 --> 00:57:46,204
Aw, come on, man.
What about my son?

1069
00:57:46,413 --> 00:57:49,791
Oh, don't fucking cry,
mate. Oi!

1070
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,460
Oh, for fuck's sake, where do you think
you're going?

1071
00:57:59,718 --> 00:58:02,595
Twat.

1072
00:58:11,563 --> 00:58:16,234
Ma, I'm gonna move out.

1073
00:58:16,443 --> 00:58:19,612
I thought Valda
was gonna move in here.

1074
00:58:19,822 --> 00:58:22,407
Val wants our own space.
I think she's right.

1075
00:58:22,616 --> 00:58:25,535
Well, you'll need help with the baby.
I mean, she looks frail.

1076
00:58:25,744 --> 00:58:28,579
I'm having a kid.
I can't go to prison.

1077
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:32,709
Nobody's going to prison
and you're going to do as you're told.

1078
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:36,003
I don't want to do
any of this anymore.

1079
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,214
I just want to be a...

1080
00:58:38,424 --> 00:58:40,425
I just want to be
a normal dad.

1081
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:45,847
- Mrs. Pringle?
- Yeah?

1082
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:47,682
I'm a friend
of your son's.

1083
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,600
Eric, yeah?
You remember me?

1084
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,145
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's fine, yeah.

1085
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:54,272
You been shopping?
You bought anything nice?

1086
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:56,232
Oh, just a few bits
for the kids, you know.

1087
00:58:56,442 --> 00:58:58,901
- Trying to cut back a bit these days.
- Yeah, times is tight.

1088
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:01,404
- We've all got too much anyway, haven't we?
- That is true.

1089
00:59:01,613 --> 00:59:03,990
I can't believe how much he looks
like his old dad.

1090
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:05,992
Yeah, poor little thing, eh?

1091
00:59:06,201 --> 00:59:08,161
What time is this bus
coming then?

1092
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:16,794
- And the fat man?
- Oh, he's really shit the bed on this one, mate.

1093
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:19,547
Looked all over for him...
high and low, here and there.

1094
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:21,799
- Yeah?
- Pie shop.

1095
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:25,803
- He's gone.
- Yeah, I thought so. I had a feeling.

1096
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:27,847
- - You want a whiskey?
- - Yeah, lovely.

1097
00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:30,516
What's going on, you know,
with the business and...

1098
00:59:30,726 --> 00:59:32,435
and the club?

1099
00:59:32,644 --> 00:59:35,772
Well, looks like I'm gonna need
a new manager, doesn't it?

1100
00:59:35,981 --> 00:59:38,775
Yeah, I've been having
a little think about that.

1101
00:59:38,984 --> 00:59:40,693
- Cheers.
- Yeah?

1102
00:59:40,903 --> 00:59:45,490
Yeah, just, you know,
about who to put in there.

1103
00:59:45,699 --> 00:59:47,825
- Yeah.
- And then I thought,

1104
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:49,786
I ran Foxy's, didn't I?

1105
00:59:49,995 --> 00:59:51,829
- For 10 years down in Eastbourne.
- Oh, yeah.

1106
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:54,707
We did a great job down there, mate.
Great job.

1107
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,584
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1108
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:59,378
- That was a long time ago, Eric.
- I mean me and Karl...

1109
00:59:59,588 --> 01:00:02,340
- it would keep us busy.
- Karl's a very busy boy.

1110
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:06,594
Yeah. No, he's probably too busy,
but I've still got time.

1111
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:09,055
I could help out
down there.

1112
01:00:09,264 --> 01:00:12,809
I thought it'd, like,
dovetail with the business.

1113
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:18,815
Yeah. Well, I mean,
obviously I understand

1114
01:00:19,024 --> 01:00:22,735
where you're coming from,
but I'll leave it with you.

1115
01:00:22,945 --> 01:00:25,238
Have a little think
about it, mate.

1116
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:27,198
I'll tell you what,
I'll think about it.

1117
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:30,535
Yeah yeah, nice nice.
Okay. So what?

1118
01:00:30,744 --> 01:00:33,621
I'll call you later maybe,
have a chat?

1119
01:00:35,624 --> 01:00:38,543
I mean, it's a good idea...
a good idea, Bill,

1120
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:42,463
because I feel that
the club could be...

1121
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,882
I've got some ideas
for the club,

1122
01:00:45,092 --> 01:00:46,384
strategic ideas.

1123
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,309
Running a club.

1124
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:00,398
- Helen.
- Where is he?

1125
01:01:00,607 --> 01:01:02,775
- Bill?
- My husband!

1126
01:01:02,985 --> 01:01:04,402
How should I know?
I'm cooking.

1127
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:06,779
- I just want his body!
- Shh, keep it down.

1128
01:01:06,989 --> 01:01:09,532
- Whatever's left!
- Keep it down, keep it down.

1129
01:01:09,741 --> 01:01:11,659
I don't want him lying
out there in a ditch!

1130
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:13,828
- Keep it... keep it...
- I won't keep it down!

1131
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:18,374
Getting eaten up by...
by things and foxes, you fuck.

1132
01:01:18,584 --> 01:01:20,293
Look, you're under
a lot of stress, Helen.

1133
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:22,336
I understand it, but it's totally
out of order.

1134
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:25,464
You cold bitch.
You're just like your father.

1135
01:01:25,674 --> 01:01:27,675
- Get out of here.
- You'll end up just like him.

1136
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,679
Unacceptable, Bill.

1137
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:35,099
I told you when we started this...
no drama.

1138
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:37,727
She's a prime candidate
for shock treatment.

1139
01:01:37,936 --> 01:01:41,981
- Nobody is gonna listen to her ravings.
- Not listen?

1140
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,358
I am surprised they didn't hear that
in fucking Kent.

1141
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,777
Why'd she start talking
about my dad?

1142
01:01:46,987 --> 01:01:50,114
Why'd she have to say that?

1143
01:02:17,476 --> 01:02:19,977
Oh, Jonny.
How you doing, buddy?

1144
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,410
- Jonny.
- Good journey, yeah?

1145
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,538
Not really, no.

1146
01:02:39,748 --> 01:02:43,125
Well, what brings you
all the way down from London, Jon?

1147
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:47,797
I told Jacob I didn't
want to come down, Bill.

1148
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:50,383
Well, why didn't
he come down himself?

1149
01:02:52,552 --> 01:02:57,515
Jacob's a little, uh,
disappointed in you, Bill.

1150
01:03:00,227 --> 01:03:04,438
A general vibe
of confusion

1151
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:07,483
and carnage coming
from your end.

1152
01:03:07,693 --> 01:03:11,320
- There's been a few ructions, but it's evening out.
- Is it?

1153
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,239
Because it doesn't
feel that way.

1154
01:03:13,448 --> 01:03:16,575
It feels like it's spiraling
into chaos, Bill.

1155
01:03:16,785 --> 01:03:19,829
You and your idiot son
in and out of court,

1156
01:03:20,038 --> 01:03:21,455
police sniffing around
everything,

1157
01:03:21,665 --> 01:03:23,874
known associates
doing moonlight flits.

1158
01:03:24,084 --> 01:03:26,544
It's the last thing
we fucking need, Bill.

1159
01:03:26,753 --> 01:03:29,964
- Well, agree with me at least!
- All right, I agree.

1160
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,591
I don't think you even know
what problems you have, Bill.

1161
01:03:32,801 --> 01:03:37,013
- Will you tell me then?
- I'm not here to explain things, Bill.

1162
01:03:38,724 --> 01:03:44,020
I'm here symbolically, yeah?

1163
01:03:44,229 --> 01:03:48,399
As a reminder that we're all
in this together, yeah?

1164
01:03:48,608 --> 01:03:51,861
- Yeah.
- Some straight thinking is called for, Bill.

1165
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:54,780
- You've let things slip away.
- But I mean, look,

1166
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:57,616
give this to Jacob and tell him
we're not falling behind.

1167
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:02,455
This, Bill...
this is money, yeah?

1168
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:05,791
You know there's more
to this than money.

1169
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,850
- Sorted, Jonny?
- Sorted, Maggie.

1170
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,853
Make sure he doesn't
get too excited, eh?

1171
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:27,980
Yeah, I'm watching him,
Jonny.

1172
01:04:29,649 --> 01:04:32,943
I know you can see
the bigger picture, yeah?

1173
01:04:33,153 --> 01:04:34,904
Yeah.

1174
01:04:36,114 --> 01:04:37,448
This house, eh...

1175
01:04:37,657 --> 01:04:40,451
- a lot of nice memories.
- Oh, yeah.

1176
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,620
I don't want anything
to mess with that.

1177
01:04:45,373 --> 01:04:49,335
Well, it's only work, eh?

1178
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:55,091
Nobody's gonna
mess it up, Jonny.

1179
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:17,363
âª You poor injured fair one,
your pardon I crave âª

1180
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:25,454
âª How soon must I follow you
down to the grave? âª

1181
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:29,875
âª There's none but you,
fair one âª

1182
01:05:30,085 --> 01:05:33,295
âª To see that sad sight âª

1183
01:05:33,505 --> 01:05:38,050
âª And by her distraction
he died the same night. âª

1184
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,478
Maggie...

1185
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:52,481
I'm not right.

1186
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:54,567
I'm...

1187
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,778
I'm having a stroke, Mags.

1188
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,405
Call an ambulance.

1189
01:05:59,614 --> 01:06:02,074
- I've poisoned you, Eric.

1190
01:06:02,284 --> 01:06:03,701
What?

1191
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:07,538
What with?
What have you done?

1192
01:06:07,747 --> 01:06:10,916
You informed
on my husband and my kid

1193
01:06:11,126 --> 01:06:12,418
and then
you killed Garvey.

1194
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:14,420
It's causing all kinds
of complications.

1195
01:06:14,629 --> 01:06:17,131
It's not true.

1196
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,675
Maggie, it's not.
I swear.

1197
01:06:19,885 --> 01:06:21,927
You always
was a wriggler,

1198
01:06:22,137 --> 01:06:23,429
even when you were a kid.

1199
01:06:26,057 --> 01:06:29,268
It's not true.
It wasn't me.

1200
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:38,235
If you weren't family,
I wouldn't have anything to do with you.

1201
01:06:38,445 --> 01:06:41,238
I mean, look at
this bloody mess.

1202
01:06:41,448 --> 01:06:45,951
All I ever do is clear up
after bloody men.

1203
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:52,291
Are you listening, Eric?

1204
01:06:55,337 --> 01:06:57,338
Christ.

1205
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:01,050
Oh, well.

1206
01:07:03,345 --> 01:07:05,304
I mean, he could be
all right, your brother.

1207
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:08,682
- - We had some great laughs.
- Did we?

1208
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:11,602
Yeah. It's a rotten thing
to have happened,

1209
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:15,397
but tough decisions
have to be made.

1210
01:07:15,607 --> 01:07:18,108
It's not the decisions
that are tough, Bill.

1211
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:20,611
It's the actions.

1212
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,571
Well, a general
can't regret decisions

1213
01:07:22,781 --> 01:07:25,115
made in the heat of battle.

1214
01:07:25,325 --> 01:07:29,662
When all is said and done,
we will believe we were right.

1215
01:07:29,871 --> 01:07:32,623
It's important to have the right intentions,
no matter the outcome.

1216
01:07:32,832 --> 01:07:35,834
- Do you want to make some tea?
- Yeah.

1217
01:07:36,044 --> 01:07:39,296
âª I'm the man that rolls âª

1218
01:07:39,506 --> 01:07:42,591
âª When icicles is hangin'
on the tree âª

1219
01:07:46,012 --> 01:07:49,390
âª I'm the man that rolls âª

1220
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,893
âª When icicles is hangin'
on the tree. âª

1221
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:57,606
For fuck's sake,
stop doing that!

1222
01:08:02,487 --> 01:08:04,029
Where's Eric?

1223
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:06,073
I haven't seen him
in a few days.

1224
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:07,992
Eric's in Spain.

1225
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:10,661
What? Now?

1226
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:13,497
- Yeah, he's got troubles of his own.
- Oh, great.

1227
01:08:13,707 --> 01:08:16,166
All hands to the pump and I'm the only
one left to do the donkey work.

1228
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:19,169
Yeah, well, people
are unreliable.

1229
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:21,922
- What?
- He's gone down there

1230
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:24,883
I think to...
to buy a bar.

1231
01:08:25,093 --> 01:08:27,011
I think he's gonna
start a club

1232
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,055
- called Los Foxos.
- No!

1233
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,769
El Foxo!

1234
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:41,317
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

1235
01:08:41,526 --> 01:08:44,320
- Bingo.
- A bit of bingo.

1236
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:47,114
I can see Eric leading the conga,
up at the front.

1237
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:50,075
Yeah. I think he must
have caught a whiff of a seÃ±orita.

1238
01:08:50,285 --> 01:08:54,121
You know what I mean?
Got straight to the airport and disappeared.

1239
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:57,666
Sounds like
a retard's dream.

1240
01:08:57,876 --> 01:09:00,085
Well, that's about
the size of it.

1241
01:09:00,295 --> 01:09:02,004
Fucking hell, he's not...

1242
01:09:02,213 --> 01:09:04,715
- El Foxo's... that's brilliant.
- Yeah.

1243
01:09:15,602 --> 01:09:18,145
âª We'll rant
and we'll roar âª

1244
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:22,024
âª Like true
British sailors âª

1245
01:09:22,233 --> 01:09:24,526
âª Range and roam âª

1246
01:09:24,736 --> 01:09:28,197
âª All on the salt sea âª

1247
01:09:28,406 --> 01:09:30,866
âª Until we strike
soundings âª

1248
01:09:31,076 --> 01:09:34,495
âª In the channel
of old England âª

1249
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:37,164
âª From Ushant to Scilly âª

1250
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:40,834
âª Is 35 leagues âª

1251
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:43,420
âª We sailed past Beachy âª

1252
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:46,423
âª Past Fairlight and Dover âª

1253
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:49,218
âª And then we bore up âª

1254
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:51,720
âª For the South Foreland
light... âª

1255
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:53,347
All together now, boys.

1256
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,058
âª We'll rant
and we'll roar âª

1257
01:09:56,267 --> 01:10:00,187
âª Like true
British sailors âª

1258
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,314
âª Range and roam âª

1259
01:10:02,524 --> 01:10:06,068
âª All on the salt sea âª

1260
01:10:06,277 --> 01:10:08,570
âª Until we strike
soundings âª

1261
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,157
âª In the channel
of old England âª

1262
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:14,743
âª From Ushant to Scilly âª

1263
01:10:14,953 --> 01:10:18,914
âª Is 35 leagues. âª

1264
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,381
Oh, come on, Maggie.

1265
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,133
Sweetheart, come back
to the party.

1266
01:10:29,342 --> 01:10:32,302
Come on.
Come on.

1267
01:10:32,512 --> 01:10:34,805
I can't, Bill.

1268
01:10:51,739 --> 01:10:53,824
It's too much, Bill.

1269
01:10:56,494 --> 01:11:00,205
Come on.

1270
01:11:00,415 --> 01:11:02,124
Oh God.

1271
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:47,920
âª Are you leaving
for the country? âª

1272
01:11:48,129 --> 01:11:53,926
âª You say the city
brings you down âª

1273
01:11:54,135 --> 01:11:59,181
âª Leave the iron clown
behind âª

1274
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:04,061
âª And feel the circus
moving on âª

1275
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:10,692
âª Are you leaving
for the country? âª

1276
01:12:10,902 --> 01:12:16,698
âª I know a little
country town âª

1277
01:12:16,908 --> 01:12:21,537
âª Where dogs are sleeping
in the cold âª

1278
01:12:21,746 --> 01:12:27,626
âª And the flagpole's
falling down. âª

1279
01:12:45,144 --> 01:12:47,271
I knew I couldn't last.

1280
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,775
You're as strong
as an ox, Dave.

1281
01:12:51,985 --> 01:12:56,154
No... I'm done.

1282
01:12:56,364 --> 01:12:59,658
You got any last words?
Any thoughts?

1283
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:05,205
- I'm tired.
- Yeah, you have a sleep, mate.

1284
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:07,207
I'm sure you'll
pull through.

1285
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:11,169
Yeah, maybe.

1286
01:13:11,379 --> 01:13:14,798
- The doctors said...
- Oh, Dave...

1287
01:13:15,008 --> 01:13:17,009
don't listen to what
the doctors say, mate.

1288
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:19,761
What do they know?

1289
01:13:25,143 --> 01:13:27,060
What is it, mate?

1290
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,646
Bill's a liability, Karl.

1291
01:13:31,316 --> 01:13:32,733
Yeah?

1292
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,902
It's all over for him.

1293
01:13:36,112 --> 01:13:38,614
It's just a matter
of time now.

1294
01:13:38,823 --> 01:13:40,157
What makes you say that?

1295
01:13:40,366 --> 01:13:41,825
I hear things.

1296
01:13:42,035 --> 01:13:45,078
What, on Ceefax?

1297
01:13:45,288 --> 01:13:48,624
You say goodbye to him
for me, will you?

1298
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:50,542
Yeah.

1299
01:13:50,752 --> 01:13:53,503
I always liked your dad.

1300
01:13:53,713 --> 01:13:56,840
That makes one of us, Dave.

1301
01:13:57,050 --> 01:14:00,469
Eric's been found.

1302
01:14:03,556 --> 01:14:06,725
- Where is he?
- He's dead, Karl.

1303
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:10,062
No.

1304
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:13,815
- I'm sorry, mate.
- He's in Spain, mate.

1305
01:14:14,025 --> 01:14:17,986
- He was a police informer, Karl.
- Bullshit.

1306
01:14:18,196 --> 01:14:21,782
That's bullshit.
That's... that's bullshit.

1307
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:25,452
Eric, Garvey,

1308
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:28,622
your old man...

1309
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,541
they all talk to plod.

1310
01:14:33,628 --> 01:14:36,797
How else do you think
your court case got squashed?

1311
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:39,007
No.

1312
01:14:46,974 --> 01:14:51,144
Look at the fucking
state of me.

1313
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:53,647
Why would I lie?

1314
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,404
Huh?

1315
01:15:00,613 --> 01:15:02,823
Why would I lie?

1316
01:15:10,915 --> 01:15:13,667
You'd better
fucking die, Dave.

1317
01:15:18,756 --> 01:15:21,091
Oh.

1318
01:15:23,678 --> 01:15:25,512
Berman's dead.

1319
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:34,563
To Dave Berman having
a drink in heaven.

1320
01:15:34,772 --> 01:15:36,732
- Dave.

1321
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:39,693
Dave.

1322
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:41,653
Had a good run,
though, didn't he?

1323
01:15:41,863 --> 01:15:43,739
He's left us right in it
though really, didn't he?

1324
01:15:43,948 --> 01:15:46,700
I mean,
it's a bit selfish.

1325
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,744
I mean, would a bit
of exercise have hurt?

1326
01:15:48,953 --> 01:15:50,746
His poor wife.

1327
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,959
Yeah, the old ones
all drop away.

1328
01:16:04,844 --> 01:16:07,679
It suddenly feels like
the end of the world.

1329
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,557
You're just tired.

1330
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:13,810
It's all a bit
fucking tiring.

1331
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:18,356
You know, I liked it best
when it was just you and me.

1332
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:50,091
Oh, Christ.

1333
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:51,593
You see?

1334
01:18:51,802 --> 01:18:53,219
And you want
to leave this house?

1335
01:18:53,429 --> 01:18:55,513
It's not safe for you
out there on your own.

1336
01:19:00,144 --> 01:19:04,773
- Who did this to you?
- One of yours, was he?

1337
01:19:04,982 --> 01:19:08,401
- What you are talking about?
- Well, it feels like your style.

1338
01:19:08,611 --> 01:19:10,820
And you call me sloppy.

1339
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:13,406
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Come off it.

1340
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:16,576
Own up to it. Own it!
Fucking own it!

1341
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:18,995
- Look what you fucking did to me.
- The situation's...

1342
01:19:19,205 --> 01:19:21,456
Look what you
fucking did to me.

1343
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:24,000
It's got nothing to do with me.
It's probably London.

1344
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:28,254
That's bullshit and you fucking know it,
you fucking liar!

1345
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:30,131
It could be a local faction
making a move.

1346
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:32,133
How the fucking hell
do I know?

1347
01:19:32,343 --> 01:19:34,511
I mean, I don't run
this town, man.

1348
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,764
- It's like juggling oil now.
- You said it was all under control.

1349
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,892
- You fucking told me it was all under control.
- That's an arrogant illusion.

1350
01:19:41,102 --> 01:19:42,936
It fucking is
an arrogant illusion,

1351
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,981
and you're the fucking
arrogant one, you prick.

1352
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:48,149
- Look, all...
- Fucking leave me alone, Dad.

1353
01:19:48,359 --> 01:19:50,527
I'm serious. Get out of my
fucking business.

1354
01:19:50,736 --> 01:19:52,696
I'm fucking serious.

1355
01:19:52,905 --> 01:19:55,240
I don't wanna hear
another fucking word from you.

1356
01:19:55,449 --> 01:19:57,534
- I'll fucking knock you out.
- Yeah?

1357
01:19:57,743 --> 01:19:59,202
Well, all I know is,
all right,

1358
01:19:59,412 --> 01:20:01,079
one, investigations;

1359
01:20:01,288 --> 01:20:04,624
two, that fucking woman
turns up;

1360
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,127
three, a trusted associate
goes missing...

1361
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:11,589
Stand fucking back, man.
I'll put these glasses in your fucking face.

1362
01:20:11,799 --> 01:20:13,633
I'm not kidding.

1363
01:20:15,219 --> 01:20:16,636
Yeah?
And four,

1364
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:18,763
a representative
of London comes down;

1365
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:20,265
and five,
you get attacked.

1366
01:20:20,474 --> 01:20:22,475
I mean, those are
the facts, right?

1367
01:20:23,936 --> 01:20:26,646
Saying them in a row
doesn't connect them.

1368
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:29,274
It's got nothing
to do with me.

1369
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:32,235
Where's Eric?

1370
01:20:32,445 --> 01:20:34,195
- Do you even know if it's your kid?
- It is!

1371
01:20:34,405 --> 01:20:36,072
What the fuck?
Where is Eric?

1372
01:20:36,282 --> 01:20:38,825
Look, I'll be absolutely honest
with you, Karl.

1373
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:41,161
She has to go.

1374
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:45,331
- What are you talking about?
- It's her... Valda.

1375
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:49,377
- Before the baby's born.
- What?

1376
01:20:49,587 --> 01:20:51,004
You'll be too attached
to her by then.

1377
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,672
Are you out of your
fucking mind, Dad?

1378
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:54,591
- We're getting married.
- Well, that's off.

1379
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,093
No, we're getting married, Dad.
We're having a kid.

1380
01:20:57,303 --> 01:20:59,429
We're... we're getting married
and we're having a kid.

1381
01:20:59,638 --> 01:21:01,639
- Trust me, son, you're too weak.
- I'm not weak.

1382
01:21:01,849 --> 01:21:03,308
- Look...
- I'm not fucking weak.

1383
01:21:03,517 --> 01:21:06,144
You've grown up privileged
and spoiled and soft,

1384
01:21:06,353 --> 01:21:08,730
and now you're unconcerned
about other people's needs.

1385
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:10,356
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1386
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:12,609
I do everything
for you, Dad.

1387
01:21:12,818 --> 01:21:16,071
I do everything for you. I make
your fucking tea, your fucking breakfast.

1388
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,864
I make your fucking dinner
half the time.

1389
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:19,491
I run your errands
all over town.

1390
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,992
What more do you
want from me?

1391
01:21:21,202 --> 01:21:23,453
Come on, seriously.

1392
01:21:23,662 --> 01:21:25,747
- She's unbalanced your mind.
- Fucking hell.

1393
01:21:25,956 --> 01:21:29,501
She's driven you crazy
and you're not making any sense.

1394
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:32,128
One more word from you
about her, Dad...

1395
01:21:32,338 --> 01:21:33,755
Just keep your beak out,
all right?

1396
01:21:33,964 --> 01:21:35,423
You want your mother and I
to go to prison?

1397
01:21:35,633 --> 01:21:38,051
- You want us to be murdered in our beds?
- No!

1398
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,887
Look, listen to me.
She's got to go.

1399
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:42,764
She's the rogue element.

1400
01:21:42,973 --> 01:21:46,643
You could have had the breakfast room
decorated by now.

1401
01:21:46,852 --> 01:21:49,312
Who are you siding with?
Your blood or some stranger you rocked up?

1402
01:21:49,522 --> 01:21:51,022
She's not just rocked up.

1403
01:21:51,232 --> 01:21:52,690
I've been going out
with her for a year.

1404
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,275
She's carrying my child.

1405
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:57,403
What fucking qualifications
does she need, Dad?

1406
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,781
Oh, I see. You're thinking,
"Wait till the old ones

1407
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:01,783
pop their clogs
and then get the house."

1408
01:22:01,992 --> 01:22:03,868
- Is that it?
- I don't want your fucking house!

1409
01:22:04,078 --> 01:22:06,704
I'd rather give it to a cats' home
than to you and that fucking slag.

1410
01:22:06,914 --> 01:22:08,414
I don't want
your fucking house.

1411
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:10,166
You'd betray your family
just to bring up

1412
01:22:10,376 --> 01:22:11,668
another man's bastard?

1413
01:22:11,877 --> 01:22:13,586
Don't talk to me
about betrayal.

1414
01:22:13,796 --> 01:22:15,380
I know that Eric
is dead.

1415
01:22:15,589 --> 01:22:17,924
And I know that you,
Eric and Garvey

1416
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:20,301
- have been talking to the police.
- What?!

1417
01:22:20,511 --> 01:22:22,720
- Where'd all this come from?
- Berman told me.

1418
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:24,889
- Death-bed confession, was it?
- As it turns out.

1419
01:22:25,099 --> 01:22:26,474
He was addled
with morphine.

1420
01:22:26,684 --> 01:22:28,309
Fucking hell, he was
chatting his bollocks

1421
01:22:28,519 --> 01:22:29,936
to anyone who came
into the room.

1422
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,021
- Was he?
- Yes.

1423
01:22:32,231 --> 01:22:35,483
- Was he?
- Yes!

1424
01:22:35,693 --> 01:22:39,070
Look, you can just tell it
to me straight, Dad.

1425
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,572
Just fucking
be honest with me

1426
01:22:40,781 --> 01:22:43,616
forjust...
forjust a minute.

1427
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:45,535
Just one minute.

1428
01:22:45,744 --> 01:22:49,164
Just fucking tell me
what's going on in there.

1429
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:54,878
Oh, you can't
fucking do it, can you?

1430
01:22:55,087 --> 01:22:57,130
You fucking coward!

1431
01:23:00,217 --> 01:23:03,303
This is disappointing.

1432
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:05,054
Take no notice of him.

1433
01:23:05,264 --> 01:23:07,390
He just says the first thing
that comes into his head.

1434
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,602
How can you stand him?
He's a fucking nightmare.

1435
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:13,396
- No, he's not a nightmare actually.
- He is a fucking nightmare.

1436
01:23:13,606 --> 01:23:17,483
- Karl, calm down.
- Mom, just fucking leave me alone, all right?

1437
01:23:17,693 --> 01:23:20,069
It's not him, Karl.
It's you.

1438
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:21,946
I mean, why don't you
just get a blood test?

1439
01:23:22,156 --> 01:23:25,116
And then if the baby's yours,
it could come and live here.

1440
01:23:25,326 --> 01:23:28,328
It'll be... it'll work out.
It'll be fine.

1441
01:23:29,914 --> 01:23:31,372
What about Valda?

1442
01:23:31,582 --> 01:23:34,542
Oh, Valda, darling...
she'll be like all the rest.

1443
01:23:34,752 --> 01:23:37,587
- She'll leave you.
- What are you talking about?

1444
01:23:37,796 --> 01:23:40,298
Oh God.

1445
01:23:40,507 --> 01:23:42,842
When you was little,
right?

1446
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:44,719
When you was born,

1447
01:23:44,929 --> 01:23:46,387
it was very different
then, Karl.

1448
01:23:46,597 --> 01:23:48,389
And they...

1449
01:23:48,599 --> 01:23:50,850
you know, they couldn't help babies
out like they do now.

1450
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,435
And there was
something wrong...

1451
01:23:52,645 --> 01:23:54,354
something went wrong.
I don't know.

1452
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:57,732
The incubator... oh, God knows
what went on really.

1453
01:23:57,942 --> 01:24:00,401
I'm sure that's why... all this business
about Eric...

1454
01:24:00,611 --> 01:24:02,195
Please stop. No, please stop.

1455
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:05,740
All this business about Eric...
and you know your dad...

1456
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:07,575
we had nothing
to do with that.

1457
01:24:07,785 --> 01:24:10,787
You all are fakes.

1458
01:24:10,996 --> 01:24:14,040
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna tell you.

1459
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:17,168
Come here, darling.
Come here.

1460
01:24:18,629 --> 01:24:21,506
Come...

1461
01:24:21,715 --> 01:24:24,717
I'll tell you what.
I'll get you your pills, eh?

1462
01:24:25,844 --> 01:24:28,304
You need
a nice lie-down.

1463
01:24:28,514 --> 01:24:32,475
âª Tell me why âª

1464
01:24:32,685 --> 01:24:36,187
âª The stars do shine âª

1465
01:24:38,065 --> 01:24:41,859
âª Tell me why âª

1466
01:24:42,069 --> 01:24:45,863
âª The ivy twines âª

1467
01:24:47,074 --> 01:24:51,244
âª Tell me why âª

1468
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:56,249
âª The ocean's blue âª

1469
01:24:56,458 --> 01:25:00,336
âª And I will tell you âª

1470
01:25:00,546 --> 01:25:05,216
âª Just why I love you âª

1471
01:25:08,178 --> 01:25:11,264
âª Because God made âª

1472
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:15,893
âª The stars to shine âª

1473
01:25:16,103 --> 01:25:19,439
âª Because God made âª

1474
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:23,192
âª The ivy twine âª

1475
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:29,198
âª Because God made âª

1476
01:25:29,408 --> 01:25:32,660
âª The ocean blue... âª

1477
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:39,751
âª Because God made you âª

1478
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,298
âª That's why I love you. âª

1479
01:26:02,983 --> 01:26:05,276
Sorry, Mom.

1480
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:10,782
âª Oh, don't you remember âª

1481
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:13,993
âª A long time ago? âª

1482
01:26:14,203 --> 01:26:17,330
âª Those two little babies âª

1483
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:20,708
âª Their names I don't know âª

1484
01:26:20,918 --> 01:26:23,544
âª They strayed away âª

1485
01:26:23,754 --> 01:26:27,173
âª One bright summer's day âª

1486
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:30,426
âª Those two little babies âª

1487
01:26:30,636 --> 01:26:33,596
âª Got lost on their way âª

1488
01:26:33,806 --> 01:26:40,311
âª Pretty babes in the wood âª

1489
01:26:40,521 --> 01:26:43,689
âª Oh, don't you remember âª

1490
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:48,277
âª Those babes in the wood? âª

1491
01:27:11,093 --> 01:27:14,053
- You expecting someone?
- Yeah. It's Valda, Mom.

1492
01:27:14,263 --> 01:27:16,806
- I thought we were going into town?
- Yeah, I know.

1493
01:27:17,015 --> 01:27:19,600
- I thought maybe you could go with her instead.
- Why?

1494
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:22,895
- Just talk to her a little bit.
- What about?

1495
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:25,314
Well, she's just
freaking out, Mom.

1496
01:27:25,524 --> 01:27:27,483
What, about the baby?

1497
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:30,611
Yeah. Maybe you could
just settle her down a bit?

1498
01:27:30,821 --> 01:27:34,782
- I'm not a counselor, Karl.
- Mom, please, Mom.

1499
01:27:34,992 --> 01:27:37,118
Fine.

1500
01:27:37,327 --> 01:27:39,328
How are you feeling?

1501
01:27:39,538 --> 01:27:41,164
Feeling pretty good, actually.

1502
01:27:41,373 --> 01:27:42,999
Yeah, not for long.

1503
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:45,877
- - What do you mean?
- - Oh, getting it out.

1504
01:27:46,086 --> 01:27:49,672
Boy, the pain.
You want someone to shoot you.

1505
01:27:49,882 --> 01:27:51,716
It's the great
conspiracy of women...

1506
01:27:51,925 --> 01:27:54,177
no one ever tells you.

1507
01:27:54,386 --> 01:27:57,680
I didn't speak
to my mother for days.

1508
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:00,725
Karl weighed
9lbs 10oz.

1509
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:03,352
There's the car.

1510
01:28:03,562 --> 01:28:05,855
Nice bit of fresh air
anyway.

1511
01:28:09,109 --> 01:28:11,986
Can you grab my cardie
out of the boot, please, Maggie?

1512
01:28:12,196 --> 01:28:13,905
Yeah.

1513
01:28:15,866 --> 01:28:18,534
Oh, what's all this plastic?

1514
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:27,960
- Do you know where your mother is?
- She's gone out.

1515
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,046
Yeah? Gone where?

1516
01:28:30,255 --> 01:28:33,174
She's gone out with Valda.

1517
01:28:33,383 --> 01:28:36,260
- They're up on the downs.
- Oh.

1518
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:39,055
I wonder if we're still
having sausages tonight then.

1519
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:42,475
I don't know.

1520
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:44,685
You all right, Karl?

1521
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,951
Got a bit of a problem, Dad.

1522
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,286
That sounds ominous.

1523
01:29:08,085 --> 01:29:10,127
It's like that, is it?

1524
01:29:11,922 --> 01:29:15,716
It's for the best...
for everyone.

1525
01:29:15,926 --> 01:29:19,011
Look, why don't you just have a cup of tea
with me and talk about it, Karl?

1526
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:21,138
No, that's all right.

1527
01:29:21,348 --> 01:29:23,349
You have one.

1528
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:34,318
Do you love me?
I love you.

1529
01:29:34,528 --> 01:29:38,864
I can't talk to you anymore.
You just confuse me.

1530
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:41,325
What's your mother
going to say?

1531
01:29:45,914 --> 01:29:49,083
She's gone already.

1532
01:29:49,293 --> 01:29:51,919
- - What's happened?
- - Dad, just sit down.

1533
01:29:52,129 --> 01:29:57,341
- Just sit down.
- Karl, where's Maggie?

1534
01:29:57,551 --> 01:30:00,428
- Karl, where is Maggie?
- Just sit down, Dad.

1535
01:31:01,531 --> 01:31:04,659
- - Hello?
- - We're in the breakfast room.

1536
01:31:12,459 --> 01:31:17,755
- Well, there he is.
- Yeah.

1537
01:31:17,964 --> 01:31:19,965
How did it go?

1538
01:31:21,885 --> 01:31:24,261
He was all right
with it, actually.

1539
01:31:25,972 --> 01:31:28,933
He was fucking
shattered, wasn't he?

1540
01:31:29,142 --> 01:31:31,143
He was knackered.

âª Where is now
my father's family âª

1544
01:32:10,183 --> 01:32:14,562
âª That was here

âª Some have gone

âª And with others

âª All their lives
