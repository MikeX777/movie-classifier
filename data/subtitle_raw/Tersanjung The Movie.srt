<i>Every love story...</i>

3
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,416
<i>begins with the first meeting.</i>

4
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,750
<i>But my love story...</i>

5
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,458
<i>begins with my arranged marriage.</i>

AMBARAWA, CENTRAL JAVA, EARLY 1998

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,583
<i>You must be wondering why,</i>

8
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,791
<i>in this modern times,</i>

9
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,708
<i>there are still families
who arrange their daughter's marriage.</i>

10
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,875
<i>It's all because of my father.</i>

11
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,666
<i>He married a woman
who has now become my stepmother.</i>

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,083
Mrs. Indah.

13
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,916
- Come, they're waiting at the garden.
- Right.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,208
Let me take you there.

15
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,750
Come on, honey. Let's go, Yura.

16
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,375
Yura...

17
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:56,791
Yes.

18
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,416
Please sit down, Mrs. Indah.

19
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:11,958
If you will excuse me,
I'll go and call Mrs. Sadewo.

20
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,041
Thank you.

21
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,958
<i>She is my father's wife.</i>

22
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,833
<i>He married her

GERRY HAR
YOUTH'S FAVORITE SINGER

24
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,750
Why haven't I seen
this edition before, Dad?

25
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,083
Do you think they would let me have it?

26
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,166
Why do you need it?

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,833
Every magazine and newspaper clipping
about your father is kept in storage.

28
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:48,375
<i>And this is my father, an ex-musician
who is not famous anymore.</i>

29
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,416
Excuse me. There are two gentlemen
outside with flowers.

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,041
Did any of you order them?

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,708
- I don't think so.
- I ordered them, sir.

32
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:02,791
This way.

33
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,916
Here's your flower, miss.

34
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,166
Thank you.

35
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,541
And I've picked the ones
according to your favorite color.

36
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,666
Miss.

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,833
Here is the invoice.

38
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,083
Security, tell her to come in!

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,416
Ms. Yura, you've been asked to come in.

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,375
<i>These two are my best friends.</i>

41
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,708
<i>They are the substitutes
for all that I have lost.</i>

42
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,208
Is there anything else? Please go.

43
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,458
- No, we don't.
- We don't.

44
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,833
Please forgive me.

45
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,791
- Did you wait long?
- Mrs. Sadewo.

46
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,916
This is Nisa.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,375
- Who is this?
- She is my biological daughter.

48
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:27,916
Mrs. Sadewo.

49
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,166
Gerry.

50
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,541
I am one of your biggest fans.

51
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,625
Yura. Come here, honey.

52
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,375
This is Yura.

53
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,625
She is my biological daughter.

54
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,750
She's beautiful.

55
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,416
Please have a seat.

56
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,250
Go on.

57
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,458
Be my guest.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,583
Boby's two younger brothers are married.

59
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,083
Even Kevin, the youngest one,

60
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,541
is going to get engaged.

61
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,833
I don't want to see Boby
getting stepped over again.

62
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:31,250
This will never happen if my husband
doesn't support me, Mrs. Sadewo.

63
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,458
I really appreciate it, Gerry.

64
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,000
Hi, honey.

65
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,416
- How are you, sir?
- I'm fine.

66
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,416
Boby Sadewo.

67
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,333
Yura.

68
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,291
- Yura Diandra...
- Diandra Hartono?

69
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,791
And I'm sure Diandra
is your mother's name.

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,416
I'm just guessing.

71
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,000
Sir, we are going to do
a music recording soon.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,416
We're going to do it together?

73
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,125
Mom, haven't you told him?

74
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,916
All right, please have a seat.
We'll talk about it now.

75
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,500
- Hi, Mrs. Indah.
- Boby.

76
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,583
Hi.

77
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,291
How is your new house, Bob?

78
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,291
I didn't choose
the wrong architect, did I?

79
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,208
In fact, I really like the design
of the recording studio...

80
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,500
You have your own recording studio?

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,208
Our recording studio,
to be precise, Mr. Gerry.

82
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,833
Are we going to record there?

83
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,125
While the instruments
are still brand-new. Why not?

84
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:26,291
Why don't you take Gerry
and Yura to see that place?

85
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,875
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sadewo,
but I can't do it today.

86
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,416
- I am scheduled to perform today.
- You can cancel it, can't you?

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,583
This is more important.

88
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,625
Or maybe Yura can go in your place?

89
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,250
That's a good idea.

90
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,875
She used to go with his father
during recording sessions.

91
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,666
I don't mind.

92
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,083
If you both give us permission,
I'll be glad to take her there.

93
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:01,041
We wouldn't mind at all. Right, Gerry?

94
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,333
How about it, Yura?

95
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,875
Do you want to come?

96
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,208
<i>Like every love story,</i>

97
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,708
<i>it's always beautiful in the beginning.</i>

98
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,625
<i>At a time like...</i>

00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,500
A FREE ADAPTATION
OF THE LEGENDARY TELEVISION SERIES

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,083
<i>I'm looking at her and feeling sad</i>

101
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,708
<i>I saw that there's something there</i>

102
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,625
Are you really

103
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,000
going to make an album for my father?

104
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,500
Why are you asking me that?

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,916
Who listens to old music nowadays?

106
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,916
I still listen to old music.

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,208
I still listen to The Beatles, Queen,
Koes Plus, the Indonesian band,

108
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,166
and I also listen to Aerosmith.

109
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,291
They're all legends, right?

110
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,541
Who knows? Maybe I am the one
who can turn your father into a legend.

111
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:48,333
<i>At a time like yesterday</i>

112
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:55,458
<i>I was silent without saying a word</i>

113
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,416
- Yes, right.
- Hey.

114
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,166
- What shall we do?
- What do you mean?

115
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,833
The music is lame and old.

116
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,083
- You want to leave?
- Let's just get out of here.

117
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,375
- Come on.
- Let's go.

118
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,458
Do you need a towel?

119
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,833
I'll get it myself in the bathroom.

120
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,958
<i>Hiding with grief</i>

121
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:51,416
<i>In the empty stars
and the dark cloudy night sky</i>

122
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,208
<i>I'm waiting for her</i>

123
00:10:55,666 --> 00:11:01,166
<i>To take me back again</i>

124
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,166
Thank you.

125
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:14,250
That was the last song for all of you
who came here tonight.

126
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,625
Have a great night.

127
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,166
Thank you, sir.

128
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,083
<i>Yura hasn't come home yet?</i>

129
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,750
I think she stayed overnight.

130
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,166
Where did she stay?

131
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,458
At Boby's house, of course.

132
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,208
Here's your coffee.

133
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,750
Why aren't you concerned that Yura
spent the night at Boby's house?

134
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,666
Why do I need to be concerned?

135
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,666
She will soon be his wife anyway.

136
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:14,083
In fact, the sooner the better.

137
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,333
The sooner the wedding is held,

138
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,875
the sooner you can release your new album.

139
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,291
Isn't that right?

140
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,833
Come on, eat your breakfast.

141
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,041
Who could that be
this early in the morning?

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,500
Go and take a look.

143
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,875
Is it your friend?

144
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,416
Good morning, Mrs. Sadewo.

145
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,791
- Mrs. Sadewo.
- We didn't expect you to come so early.

146
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,708
- Please come in.
- That's not necessary.

147
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,708
I just want to give this back.

148
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,625
- That's for me. Have some manners.
- Wait, I just want to see it.

149
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,458
LETTER OF DEBT AGREEMENT

150
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,208
A letter of debt agreement?

151
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,833
Give it to me!

152
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,416
Careful! Don't tear out the letter!
It's very important!

153
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,291
Mrs. Sadewo, haven't we talked
about this yesterday?

154
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,833
The wedding is cancelled,

155
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,125
including the recording of Gerry's album.

156
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,500
You owe her five billion rupiah?

157
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,333
Why did we come to her house?

158
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,166
Please shut your mouth!

159
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,791
So you don't even know
the affairs of your own wife?

160
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,833
Mrs. Sadewo,
let's just talk this through, okay?

161
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:38,833
Seize the house.

162
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,416
- Go!
- Take the deed and all their belongings.

163
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,333
- Wait!
- Please, Mrs. Sadewo!

164
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,583
Please. I will take responsibility,
but please tell me what happened?

165
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,666
Hey!

166
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,583
Your daughter has robbed Boby.

167
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,041
And she left a scar on his face.

168
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,708
- Mrs. Sadewo!
- Hey!

169
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,916
Mrs. Sadewo!

170
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:06,458
- Yura is my daughter, not hers!
- Please, I will talk to Yura.

171
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,708
- I will talk to her!
- Yura is my daughter!

172
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:10,750
- She is my responsibility!
- Gerry!

173
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,208
She'll never do such a thing!

174
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,625
I will talk to her, Mrs. Sadewo!

175
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,166
That's enough!

176
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,041
I will give you a week.

177
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,291
If Yura doesn't come,
and you haven't paid your debt,

178
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,125
you must all leave this house!

179
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,416
Mrs. Sadewo.

180
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,416
Mrs. Sadewo.

181
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,708
Let's go!

182
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,500
<i>Everything is ruined!</i>

183
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,541
<i>This never would've happened
if your daughter wasn't such a fool!</i>

184
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,125
Watch your mouth!

185
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,833
It's you who owes her five billion!

186
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,000
If I don't borrow,
how can we pay the bills?

187
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,291
How can we pay for Yura's
and Nisa's education?

188
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,583
Gerry!

189
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,500
Just so you know, your songs
aren't worth anything anymore!

190
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,333
And now, your daughter
has ruined everything!

191
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,125
Including your own dream!

192
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,291
- Nisa, where do you think you're going?
- I'm going with Dad!

193
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,583
Nisa!

194
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,291
<i>Where are you going to look for Yura, Dad?</i>

195
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:18,291
<i>As far as I know,
Yura only has two friends.</i>

196
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,958
Yura is going to stay here for now
until she settles her problem.

197
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,125
Are you Oka, Yura's friend?

198
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,041
- Yes. What's the matter, sir?
- Where is she?

199
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,458
I'll tell you where she is.

200
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,875
Yura is my daughter!

201
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,351
- What right do you have on my daughter?
- You want me to strangle your child too?

202
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,166
- What is this?
- What's going on here?

203
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,750
- Who are you?
- I'm the owner of this boarding house.

204
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,500
- Who is she?
- She's my wife!

205
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,583
Why are you hitting my son?

206
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm looking for my daughter, Yura.

207
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:54,416
Calm down, Dad.

208
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
Where is Yura?

209
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,333
- Where's Yura?
- Listen. Come here, Dad.

210
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,416
- Mr. Gerry is my friend's father.
- All right, go on.

211
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,875
- Okay.
- Her name is Yura.

212
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,517
- She left her house last night.
- You took a girl out of her house?

213
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,809
- You took her out of her house?
- Who is that?

214
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,059
- What's the matter?
- You raped her?

215
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,000
- No!
- What's going on?

216
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,708
- Then what?
- Just wait a second, Dad!

217
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,833
Hey, Oka! Where's Yura?

218
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,791
- You have to promise first...
- Promise what?

219
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,250
- Where is she?
- Hey, hold on a second.

220
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,666
You have to promise me
not to take her back to your house.

221
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,708
Yes, my dad agrees.
Please tell us where she is right now.

222
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,166
Sir.

223
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:42,708
There she is.

224
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,708
It's been a while

225
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,125
since you visited her, right?

226
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,583
What happened to you?

227
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,000
Talk to me.

228
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,125
What have you heard about me?

229
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,166
I don't want to hear it from other people.

230
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,083
I want to hear it from you.

231
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:29,375
Bob?

232
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,250
Hey. No.

233
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What's wrong?

234
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,916
You don't trust me?

235
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,375
What difference does it make?

236
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,250
In the end,
we are still going to get married.

237
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,541
I think I should go home now.

238
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,291
I need to go home now.

239
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,208
Bob!

240
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,375
Your family owes my family a lot of money!

241
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,916
You are just collateral!

242
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,708
- Let me go!
- Shut up!

243
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,500
<i>A week before we went
to Mrs. Sadewo's house,</i>

244
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,916
I had told Tian and Oka about it.

245
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,291
I told them that I was
being arranged for marriage.

246
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,666
They insisted on looking out for me.

247
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,333
But I told them not to do that.

248
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry, Dad.

249
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,125
But I will never go back to your house.

250
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,041
All of this shouldn't have happened

251
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,000
if I wasn't like this.

252
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,083
I feel so helpless!

253
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,083
I already hit rock bottom.

254
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,625
<i>All of this is just the beginning.</i>

255
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:04,416
<i>The start of my journey
that begins with the wound.</i>

256
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,583
SPECIAL CUISINE <i>TUMPANG KOYOR</i>
DELICIOUSLY SPICY!

257
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,333
<i>It's just that I didn't think</i>

258
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,083
<i>I would lose everything.</i>

259
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,291
<i>I've lost my mom before,</i>

260
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,583
<i>now I've lost my father.</i>

261
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,708
<i>All of my family.</i>

262
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,416
- Oka!
- Yes, Dad?

263
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,750
Take the <i>koyor</i> out of the fridge.

264
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:28,833
Hold on, Dad.

265
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,791
I'm trying a new recipe.

266
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,750
Recipe?

267
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,291
You're just making instant noodles.

268
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,875
What?

269
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,708
Why are you making instant noodles?

270
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,416
You little monkey!

271
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,875
Now, just take out the <i>koyor</i>
from the fridge, okay?

272
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,916
I'll teach you how to cook.

273
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,916
- Hey, hold on a second!
- What?

274
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,333
Let me tell you something.
Your mother is a foreigner.

275
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:59,000
She can't cook <i>tumpang koyor</i>.

276
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,375
I will teach you how to cook it.

277
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,500
How to cook <i>tumpang koyor</i>!
Cook! Do you understand?

278
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,083
I'm not your only son.
Go and ask the others to do it.

279
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,666
Why do I have to do everything?

280
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,333
I want you to do it!
What's the matter with you?

281
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,875
That's not fair, Dad!
Why do I always have to do it?

282
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,583
Who's asking you to go to a fair,
like Jakarta Fair?

283
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:19,916
Mom, Dad called me a monkey!

284
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,041
Well, that's true, honey.

285
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,333
I told you so.

286
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,916
Here you go! Fried bananas, your favorite.

287
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,416
Come on, have some.

288
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,750
Yura, this is your favorite.
Why aren't you eating it?

289
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:46,125
Later, Ian. I'm making my life's
short and long-term goals.

290
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,416
Really?

291
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,125
I don't want to keep
on being a burden to Oka.

292
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,666
I need to finish my college degree.

293
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,142
I'm going to take a lot of classes
so I can graduate and work.

294
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,791
Oka and his family are happy
that you're here.

295
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:05,375
- I don't feel good about that.
- Why don't you feel good about it?

296
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,833
- I've stayed here too long...
- Tian! Yura!

297
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:12,708
Here it is, my new recipe!

298
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,291
What are you guys doing there?
Come here and try this.

299
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,458
Come here and try this.

300
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:21,875
- What is that?
- Just try it.

301
00:24:22,833 --> 00:24:25,000
This is for Yura,
and this one is for Tian.

302
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,916
- Okay.
- What is it? Instant noodles?

303
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,875
Just try it.

304
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:29,166
Looks good.

305
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,333
- What do you think?
- I haven't tasted it yet!

306
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,958
Is it good?

307
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,333
- It's good, right?
- Yes, the sauce is very spicy.

308
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:44,833
So do you think I'm worthy
of being called a chef? Chef Oka Saputra.

309
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,625
Lunch is ready!

310
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:50,416
Please bring those plates over there.
And also the rice.

311
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,041
Come on, everybody! Eat!

312
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,958
- Oka, Cristian, Yura! Hurry!
- <i>Tumpang koyor</i>.

313
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,208
- <i>Tumpang koyor</i>.
- Let's go.

314
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,708
So am I worthy or not?

315
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,125
- Hurry up!
- Gather up!

316
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:06,541
Where is it, Mrs. Somad?

317
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,791
Come here.

318
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,291
- I want some too.
- This is for you.

319
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,541
- Yura! Ian!
- I want some <i>koyor</i>.

320
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,250
What do you think?
You haven't answered my question.

321
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,125
Yes, you are worthy to be called a chef.

322
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:29,000
Only if you can make instant noodles
with a <i>tumpang koyor</i> flavor like this.

323
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,125
That's right!

324
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,625
How can I make instant noodles
with a <i>tumpang koyor</i> flavor?

325
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,666
Here you go.

326
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,750
I want some more.

327
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:40,750
- Have some more, okay?
- Okay, Mrs. Somad.

328
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,458
<i>Mr. Burhan, my scholarship
is still in effect, right?</i>

329
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:49,291
As long as your GPA is 3.5 or above,
it will be in effect until you graduate.

330
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:52,875
If you can graduate quickly,
that would benefit the university.

331
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,333
How about it?

332
00:25:54,416 --> 00:25:56,750
Are you going to add extra classes
for this semester?

333
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,041
- Is there anything else?
- That would be all, Mr. Burhan.

334
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,458
- Thank you.
- Okay. You're welcome.

335
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:10,833
<i>My fellow comrades who are well known
and who are unnoticed by the public,</i>

336
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,375
<i>who are courageous
and without ulterior motives,</i>

337
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,083
<i>who are selfless and who's given
all they have for others.</i>

338
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:21,041
<i>My fellow comrades, let us overthrow
this depravity of a regime!</i>

339
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:25,416
<i>The apprehension of activists,
the imprisonment and abductions...</i>

340
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,416
NEPOTISM, POWER, AND CRONYISM
IN THE NEW ORDER GOVERNMENT

341
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,541
What is this?

342
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,625
<i>There is no other option,
fight them or die!</i>

343
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,458
Why are you reading this stuff?

344
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,291
Ian, when are you
going to propose to Yura?

345
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,416
What's the matter with you?
Why are you talking nonsense?

346
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,666
How long are you going
to keep it to yourself?

347
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,125
Let me tell you something.

348
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,375
Listen.

349
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,041
If you had proposed to her
in the beginning,

350
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,083
maybe she wouldn't
have ended up like this.

351
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:57,333
So easy to accept
an arranged marriage by her parents.

352
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,375
What's that got to do with it?

353
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,958
They had to put her in an arranged
marriage because of their debt.

354
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,000
It wouldn't matter
if I proposed to her or not.

355
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,083
You're ridiculous.

356
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,250
Ian, of course it would matter.

357
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,375
If you were already together,
things wouldn't be like this.

358
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,708
- Ian, listen to me.
- What is it?

359
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:21,333
Yura needs someone who will support her
in making her own choices.

360
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,333
- So?
- If you're with her,

361
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,958
she'll follow you wherever you go.

362
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:27,958
It's obvious!
That incident wouldn't have happened.

363
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:30,041
She almost got raped, you know?

364
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:33,758
Come on, Ian. Before anything else
happens to her, just propose to her.

365
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,791
Who's proposing? Who's the lucky girl?

366
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,833
Are you guys talking about me?

367
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,875
Ian wants to propose to you.

368
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:43,958
You want to propose to me?

369
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,625
That's right, Yura.

370
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,916
I've always wanted to propose to you.

371
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:58,625
Because you are the right person...

372
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,125
You are the right person

373
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:10,125
to become the Finance Manager
for our business.

374
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,083
What business, Oka?

375
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:21,208
That's right, Oka.
Please explain it to Yura.

376
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,500
This is all his idea.

377
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:24,916
I need to go to the bathroom.

378
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,625
- What are you doing?
- I need to go to the bathroom!

379
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,500
Yura, please come here. Just sit down.

380
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,000
Have a seat.

381
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:37,250
- Where were we? Right, business!
- What kind of business?

382
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:41,625
We are going to make
a profitable business that has a future.

383
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,291
What kind of business?
What are you guys going to make?

384
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:47,208
You know, a business of...
What is it called, Ian?

385
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,333
- That hurts!
- Business...

386
00:28:48,916 --> 00:28:50,166
It's a business about...

387
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,291
- Instant noodles.
- That's right.

388
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:55,458
- Instant noodles?
- What? Yes, that's right.

389
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,208
You want to supply instant noodles?

390
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,791
- No, not a supplier.
- Not that.

391
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,708
We are planning to put up a store
that sells instant noodles.

392
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:04,416
- Like those kiosks near the sidewalks?
- No, it's different.

393
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,708
- It's different.
- Explain it.

394
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:09,041
We're going to make it a cool place
where young people can hang out.

395
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,458
- Excuse me, I want to ask something.
- Yes?

396
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,750
- Do you know Yura Diandra?
- Yura?

397
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,333
- She majors in Economics.
- Yura usually hangs out there.

398
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,250
- Really? Thank you.
- You're welcome.

399
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,166
Hold on a minute.

400
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:28,000
Why are you guys starting
a business like this all of a sudden?

401
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,625
What's going on?

402
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,458
And why are you asking me to join?

403
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,083
Here's the thing, Yura.

404
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:46,000
Actually, this is all Ian's idea.

405
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,708
Isn't that right, Ian?

406
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:50,875
Ian is planning all of this to help you.

407
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:56,083
Hopefully, this can help pay off
your parents' debt.

408
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,833
- Yura!
- Is it true, Ian?

409
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,541
Nisa?

410
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,166
Why aren't you at school?

411
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,625
What is it?

412
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,583
Didn't you see how panicked I looked?

413
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:15,166
But she looks more cheerful.
That's a good thing, right?

414
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,500
Oka, Ian.

415
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,708
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Sure.

416
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,166
Hey, why didn't you propose to her?

417
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,333
Are you crazy?

418
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,666
Next time you want to pull something
like that, you better tell me first!

419
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,250
But it turned out fine, right?
Didn't you see her face?

420
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,666
I also looked terrified! You imbecile!

421
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:38,333
The house, the car,
and our furniture have all been sold.

422
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,875
Well, they were only worth
two and a half billion rupiah.

423
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,083
Why was their worth so low?

424
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,291
What else can we do, Yura?

425
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,166
Mrs. Sadewo's goons
kept on terrorizing us.

426
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:57,666
And then?

427
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,833
How are we going to pay off
the rest of the debt?

428
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,291
Last night,

429
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,708
after Dad came back
from Mrs. Sadewo's house,

430
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,250
he suddenly collapsed.

431
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,791
The doctor said he had a stroke.

432
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:29,291
That's Dad's room.

433
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,500
What are you doing here?
Haven't you had enough?

434
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:36,583
Mom.

435
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,791
Calm down, Mom.

436
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:44,875
That's enough.

437
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,500
Do we have money to pay the hospital?

438
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,958
We can't even pay half of our rent.

439
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:54,791
But I will find a job, Yura.

440
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,041
What about your studies?

441
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:03,958
No.

442
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,458
You don't need to find a job.

443
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,500
- You must go to school.
- How do we pay for it?

444
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:12,458
That's none of your concern, Nisa.

445
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,958
You just need to go to school
until you graduate, okay?

446
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,958
And if you need anything,
you can find me at Oka's house.

447
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,625
I need to go now.

448
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,458
Yura.

449
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,708
This situation isn't fair to you.

450
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:34,958
Nisa.

451
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,250
I'm not looking for fairness.

452
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,375
I only seek acceptance.

453
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,208
You stay here and accompany Dad, okay?

454
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,250
Here it is.

455
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,166
Hey, go ahead. Try this.

456
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:56,000
Because of that act you did yesterday,
I couldn't sleep last night.

457
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,875
- Try it.
- Which one is spicy?

458
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,500
The one on the left.

459
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:05,083
<i>I know what's good for a woman like you!</i>

460
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,333
<i>I don't have anybody else, Auntie!</i>

461
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,208
<i>Are you talking back to me? What is this?</i>

462
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,166
Stop watching soap operas.
You need to eat first.

463
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:19,333
<i>Hey, if you want to get married,
Hendra is waiting for you!</i>

464
00:34:19,416 --> 00:34:22,208
- You need to eat first!
- I can eat and watch at the same time.

465
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:27,375
This is good.

466
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,958
What did you use for seasoning?

467
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,958
That's a secret.

468
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,791
Here she comes.

469
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:36,875
- Yura, come here.
- Yura!

470
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,333
Come on. Here, try this out.

471
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,958
You need to try this.

472
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,250
This one is not spicy.
Instant noodles made by Oka.

473
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,166
- Try it, Yura.
- This time it's delicious.

474
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:57,416
Oka, it's so delicious! For someone
who doesn't like spicy food, this is good.

475
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,833
- It's good, right?
- We can start our business now.

476
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,666
Hey, hold on a second.

477
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,666
We're starting an instant noodle business,

478
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,559
but that doesn't mean
we'll put it up instantly.

479
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:08,500
Everything needs to be calculated.
We need to relax and slow down

480
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:10,708
so everything will go smoothly.
Right, Oka?

481
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,541
We need to check the materials
and a lot of other things.

482
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,583
- We need to plan everything.
- Let's do it now.

483
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,333
- Wait a minute.
- What do we need?

484
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,416
Stop it. Put this down for now.

485
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,791
Why are you in such a hurry?
Just relax, okay?

486
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,583
If we don't hurry,
others will beat us to it.

487
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,666
- Just relax.
- We need to be first.

488
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,625
You need to relax. Just trust me on this.

489
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:37,500
For the next five, ten years, Indonesians
will still love instant noodles.

490
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,000
- Especially with my recipe.
- Oka's recipe is delicious!

491
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,750
- Just relax for now.
- It's good, right?

492
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,083
Well, you guys are lucky.

493
00:35:43,666 --> 00:35:46,208
You still have parents
who give you a monthly allowance.

494
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:47,916
What about me?

495
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,583
It's not like that, Yura. What I mean is...

496
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:56,541
If we do this slowly,
everything will be much better.

497
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,208
All right, you guys go ahead
and count slowly.

498
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,041
I'm going to look for a job.

499
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:03,916
Yura!

500
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,500
Aren't you going to give this
another thought?

501
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,416
WITHDRAWAL LETTER

502
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,458
This is very unfortunate.
Your GPA is above average.

503
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,208
I can't be selfish, Mr. Burhan.

504
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,833
I need to find a job.

505
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,333
Thank you.

506
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,666
What is going on anyway?
I've never used a dollar before.

507
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,916
I've been using rupiah
ever since I was a child.

508
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,416
People from Jakarta are very finicky.
I don't care about that kind of stuff.

509
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,875
I just want to sell newspapers
so my family can eat.

510
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,291
Everything's okay. That's it.

511
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,875
JOB VACANCIES

512
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,500
Honey!

513
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,083
It's lunchtime!

514
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:16,666
I made some very special <i>tumpang koyor</i>
that isn't spicy at all just for you.

515
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,916
- Thank you, Mrs. Somad.
- You have to eat it all.

516
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,666
- I made a lot, you know?

00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,875
- Just tell me what the issue is.
- It's okay.

519
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,041
Yura Diandra, please come in.

520
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,291
This way, miss.

521
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,375
This way, please.

522

<i>Here's the thing.</i>

523
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:56,250
<i>We need to cancel the interview, okay?</i>

524
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,583
Why is that?

525
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:02,250
Well, the situation in this office
is a little chaotic right now.

526
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,875
However, I will contact you again, okay?

527
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,500
You can go now.

<i>The fall of the rupiah exchange rate
against the US dollar</i>

529
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,791
<i>will cause thousands of people
to become unemployed.</i>

530
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:21,583
<i>The number of unemployed will increase
by more than five million.</i>

<i>Several countries have also experienced
monetary crises. Countries like...</i>

532
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,250
You have to eat, Dad.

533
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:32,583
Open your mouth.

534
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:34,958
Nisa, please help me.

535
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,708
When are your exams?

536
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,625
In three months.

537
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:47,541
- Which high school do you want to go to?
- How are we going to pay for it?

538
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,541
We can't even pay the hospital bills.

539
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,750
And we still need to pay off
our debt to the Sadewos.

540
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,208
You guys are dreaming.

541
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:08,833
Mom.

00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,500
Excuse me, Nurse.
Where is the patient in this room?

544
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,041
He was sent home this afternoon.

545
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:37,250
- Are you Yura?
- Yes.

546
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,583
Your sister, Nisa, left you a message.

547
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,208
Here you go.

548
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:45,291
<i>Dad was allowed to go home, Yura.</i>

549
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:49,833
<i>I called Oka's house,
but they told me you weren't home yet.</i>

550
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,958
<i>If you can, please come by
our house, okay?</i>

551
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,500
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

552
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,833
Does Mr. Gerry live here?

553
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:24,083
- Yes, he does.
- Yes.

554
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,000
Here?

555
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,375
- Yes.
- Right.

556
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,458
Yura!

557
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,625
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

558
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,833
Come, Daddy's inside.

559
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,708
Hi, Yura.

560
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,375
You guys?

561
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,791
Why are you here?

562
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,833
Dad was able to go home because of Tian.

563
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:55,166
The menu for our business is all set.

564
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,041
Everything is ready.
The menu, the employees.

565
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,333
We just need to start.

566
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,125
Yura?

567
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,833
- Yura!
- Make way.

568
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:08,958
Yura?

569
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:10,791
Yura!

570
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:16,583
Yura, listen to me.
What's the matter with you?

571
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,875
What's the matter?
Did I do something wrong to you?

572
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,916
Didn't you tell us
not to take things slow?

573
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:25,916
Why are you acting like this?

574
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,333
I'm the selfish person here.

575
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:41,208
I am selfish, finicky,
disrespectful, and very arrogant...

576
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I am...

577
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,625
Listen to me.
Everything has been taken care of.

578
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:49,250
What do you mean?

579
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,083
The hospital bills...

580
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,708
and your father's house rent
has all been taken care of.

581
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,333
My father's house rent?

582
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,208
I've paid in advance for two years.

583
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,291
How do you know
all of my family's problems?

584
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,041
I know it from Nisa.
She told me everything.

585
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,291
Don't blame Nisa. Do you hear me?

586
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,583
Don't blame her.
This has nothing to do with her.

587
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,041
She didn't do anything wrong.

588
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:29,916
In fact, because of her,

589
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,166
Oka and I became motivated
to start our business immediately.

590
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:37,958
Isn't that what you wanted?
That's what we all want, right?

591
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:40,291
So we can start our business
and develop it.

592
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,458
How did you get that much money, Ian?

593
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,833
- Where did you get it?
- That's not important.

594
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,875
It's not important where I got it from.

595
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,083
It's important to me.

596
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:56,750
Where did you get it?

597
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:59,666
You don't trust me?

598
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:06,291
Believe me,
I will never do something foolish.

599
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,541
I will never steal other people's money.

600
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:15,916
Okay.

601
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,125
Why are you doing all this?

602
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:28,416
What is your intention?

603
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:38,875
Oka is right.

604
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,791
He always told me...

605
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,666
"Tell her the truth, Ian.
Talk to her face to face."

606
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:53,666
But I always avoided it.
I never listened to him.

607
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,208
Because I wasn't ready, Yura.

608
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:02,125
I wasn't ready to be honest with you.

609
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,333
I...

610
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:13,375
I am doing this...

611
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:18,541
because...

612
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,541
Because I love you.

613
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,333
I love you, Yura.

614
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:45,708
I want to...

615
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,458
help you realize your dreams.

616
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,125
You're kidding, right?

617
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:00,416
You think I'm joking?

618
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,833
Why do you think I'm doing all this?

619
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:07,458
That it's all a lie? I'm lying to you?

620
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:17,666
You know that I'm not ready
to have a new relationship.

621
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,625
You know what happened
that night, don't you?

622
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,708
- I'm still not ready to trust...
- Yura.

623
00:45:27,083 --> 00:45:28,416
I promise you...

624
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,500
I will never hurt your feelings.

625
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,166
I will try, Ian.

626
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,708
And I will wait for you.

627
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,208
But remember

628
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,125
all the money that you gave my family,

629
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,875
I consider it as debt.

630
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,625
Whatever.

631
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:24,875
It's up to you.

632
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:30,750
I only ask one thing from you.

633
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,416
I want you to trust me.

634
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,666
<i>To be honest,
I'm already fed up with love.</i>

635
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:53,083
<i>Especially if it begins with pity.</i>

636
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:55,458
Thank you.

637
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,291
<i>Maybe I'm naive.</i>

638
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,000
<i>But I'm not selfish.</i>

639
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:04,125
<i>I'm grateful when people are good to me.</i>

640
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:09,041
<i>Especially to that person
who saved my life.</i>

641
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:12,458
<i>The sweet story</i>

642
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,208
<i>Just woke up from a dream...</i>

643
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,583
- Instant noodles special with satay.
- Okay.

644
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,500
How can I help you? What's your order?

645
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:21,875
Yoi Mie? Come with me.

646
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,208
I want toppings...

647
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,583
One more with chicken satay.

648
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:28,125
<i>In mother's embrace</i>

649
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:32,708
<i>Like a rose</i>

650
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:36,166
<i>So pretty and beautiful</i>

651
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:38,333
How does it taste? Is it good?

652
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:39,541
- Yes.
- Thank you.

653
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,833
What do you guys think?
Did you like the noodles?

654
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,267
It's very delicious.
My friends really like it.

655
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,851
This is an ordinary instant noodle, right?
How can it taste this good?

656
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:49,041
That's what makes it special.
This is all in the secret recipe of...

657
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,458
Chef Oka!

658
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,666
Oka Saputra!

659
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:59,250
<i>The beautiful story</i>

660
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:05,416
<i>It will be the reason
For this face to keep smiling...</i>

661
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,333
- Two million, four hundred and...
- In just one day?

662
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:12,125
- Sixty-seven thousand?
- Sixty-seven?

663
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:15,041
Oka! Hey!

664
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,000
- Hey, stop playing!
- What is it?

665
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:20,041
- This is how much we got.
- How much?

666
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,916
Two million, four hundred and...

667
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,541
Sixty-seven thousand rupiah!

668
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:25,333
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

669
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:31,958
This is from Yura to pay for your school.

670
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,583
Please give my gratitude to my sister.

671
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:38,208
Sorry that we have to meet here.
I don't want Mom to know about it.

672
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,708
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- You're welcome.

673
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:00,750
One or two?

674
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,500
- We'll order two, please.
- All right.

675
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,083
Here you go!

676
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,500
This one is with a satay topping
and this is the chicken special.

677
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:19,833
<i>Like a rose</i>

678
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:22,250
<i>So pretty and beautiful...</i>

679
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:23,583
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

680
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:26,166
- Can I talk to the owner of Yoi Mie?
- That's us.

681
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,458
I am from Kawula Muda.

682
00:49:29,416 --> 00:49:30,416
Kawula Muda Magazine?

683
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,559
- The magazine?
- That's right.

684
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:32,823
- Really?
- How can we help you?

685
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,666
Dad, take a look at this.

686
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:45,916
My business with Oka and Cristian
was featured in a magazine.

687
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,916
Look, isn't this cool? That's me!

688
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,458
- My grades are good.
- Do you see it, Dad?

689
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:53,708
REPORT CARD

690
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:55,375
- Go and tell your father.
- Sure.

691
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,458
Dad.

692
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:58,666
- Hi!
- Yura?

693
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,833
Yura, take a look at this.

694
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:02,083
My grades are good.

695
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,750
Dad, look at this!

696
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,875
- You're such a smart kid!
- Thank you!

697
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:10,833
You should've cut your hair.
This ruined the picture.

698
00:50:10,916 --> 00:50:13,333
Look, this is your right side
and this is your left.

699
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:16,083
- What is this?
- Hey, I haven't finished reading it!

700
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:18,708
- There's something more important.
- What is it?

701
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:23,083
Happy wedding anniversary, Mom and Dad!

702
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,041
Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Somad!

703
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,166
- Dad, open it.
- All right.

704
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,291
I'm opening it.

705
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,916
What is this, son?

706
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,125
- Is it a walkie-talkie?
- It's a cell phone, Dad.

707
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,142
- Cell phone? Where's the cable?
- Like this, Dad...

708
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,041
Modern telephones are like this.

709
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,583
Can I call the house with this?

710
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,041
You can call Mom too.

711
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,958
- Really?
- Because Mom also has one.

712
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,250
You both can call each other
with this cell phone.

713
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,375
Thank you, Ian.

714
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:44,083
For what?

715
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:50,833
For everything.

716
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:04,541
At first, I was hesitant
to go through all this.

717
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,791
You really are a nice guy, aren't you?

718
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:29,708
Yura.

719
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:32,041
What is it?

720
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:37,750
May I ask you something?

721
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,791
What is it?

722
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:57,125
How do I say this? I've always wanted

723
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,541
to tell you this.

724
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:04,333
Ian, you've already told me

725
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,375
that you couldn't tell me
anything at all before, right?

726
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:11,416
That's right.

727
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:16,666
But this time is different.

728
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:38,958
Yura Diandra Hartono.

729
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:46,541
Will you marry me?

730
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,375
Ian.

731
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:11,166
I am not saying no.

732
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,041
But I'm not saying yes either.

733
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:21,833
Don't misunderstand.
It's not that I don't love you.

734
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:25,375
But I still don't know who you are, Ian.

735
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:28,625
And your family...

736
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,083
I haven't even met them.

737
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,416
You know that

738
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,958
I've always wanted
to have a normal family,

739
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:45,916
not just a relationship with you,

740
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:49,375
but also a relationship
between my family and yours.

741
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:22,958
Who are you looking for?

742
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:24,916
Young master!

743
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,666
Come.

744
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:21,958
Is this your house?

745
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:26,541
Are you like Batman?

746
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,541
I'll never forget your name,
Master Cristian.

747
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,025
You don't need to call me "Master."

748
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:44,208
Please come in.
Your mother is waiting. Come.

749
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:47,416
Come on, honey.

750
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,375
I'll just wait here.

751
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:52,625
You said you wanted to meet my parents.

752
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,208
This way.

753
00:57:57,125 --> 00:57:59,458
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home?

754
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:01,583
We could've picked you up.

755
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:03,833
Come on. I'm not like Robert, Mom.

756
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:06,458
- I don't like being treated like...
- Yes, I know that.

757
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:09,333
You don't want to be compared to him.
I know that.

758
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,541
Are you good and healthy?

759
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:22,125
- Who did you come here with?
- I came here with Yura.

760
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,708
Yura Diandra Hartono.

761
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,708
Yura Diandra Hartono?

762
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:36,041
Aren't you the daughter of...

763
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,638
What's his name?
That famous singer, right?

764
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:45,458
- Grace.
- Yes, ma'am?

765
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:48,958
Please take Cristian's friend here
to her room. Okay?

766
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,250
- All right, ma'am.
- Good.

767
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,541
Come, Ms. Yura.

768
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:57,541
We will have dinner together tonight.

769
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,875
I'm going to cook your favorite dish.

770
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,000
It's been a while, Mom.

771
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,541
Yura?

772
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,125
Honey, you're so beautiful.

773
00:59:58,708 --> 00:59:59,708
Let's eat.

774
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:03,083
Grace.

775
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,083
Come and join us.

776
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:08,791
You have to try that fried rice.
It's very delicious.

777
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:10,125
You need to try it.

778
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,416
Is Robert going to join us as well?

779
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,916
According to our customs here,

780
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,291
you are not allowed to speak
before being given permission.

781
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,375
Sorry.

782
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,583
Not everyone is accustomed to our customs.

783
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,830
That's why it's important to choose
a partner with the same background as you.

784
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,458
Yura is not so different from me, Mom.

785
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:05,166
And I'm very certain

786
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:09,666
that she is willing to learn
our family customs.

787
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,958
Isn't that right, honey?

788
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:23,291
Here's the thing, honey.

789
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:28,166
Currently, Robert lives in America,
taking up his master's degree,

790
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,083
but he also has a business there.

791
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,958
His little brother should've gone
with him to America.

792
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,208
But you always wanted to do
something different.

793
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:44,250
Good evening, everyone!
Forgive me if I'm late.

794
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,833
Please have a seat.

795
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,791
Tian.

796
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:56,541
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

797
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:59,958
It turns out that this rascal
is good at finding a girlfriend.

798
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:04,666
Come, let's eat.

799
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:11,291
Please serve your girlfriend first
before you serve yourself, okay?

800
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:41,625
Do you both attend the same university?

801
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,500
That's right, sir.

802
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,166
I mean, Mr. Salim.

803
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:49,375
Come on, please don't be shy.

804
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:52,541
Just like Tian, you can call me "Dad."

805
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:01,041
Well, Rachel has told me a lot
about your relationship.

806
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:04,541
And basically, I have no objection.

807
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,875
Tian is old enough.

808
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,517
He has been taking care of himself
since high school.

809
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:13,500
So whatever he decides,
I will support him.

810
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,833
No problem at all.
Isn't that right, honey?

811
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,166
There's absolutely no problem here.

812
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,000
Everything is settled.

813
01:03:33,791 --> 01:03:36,833
But there's one thing

814
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:41,125
that I want you to do
before I can give you my blessings.

815
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,166
What is that, Dad?

816
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:45,666
It's your brother, Robert.

817
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:50,791
He was careless in managing
his business in Los Angeles.

818
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,458
So now his company
is experiencing bad credit.

819
01:03:55,041 --> 01:04:00,208
I've sent my auditors from England,
but they also couldn't handle it.

820
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:02,541
I don't trust them.

821
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:08,583
And I will not give that to them.

822
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:13,625
So I want you to go there
and handle this problem.

823
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:22,208
But I don't know anything
about Robert's business.

824
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:29,125
Did you know anything about noodles
when you first started that business?

825
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:30,458
You didn't know, right?

826
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:37,166
That noodle thing
is just a small business.

827
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:42,583
It's as simple as that.

828
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,375
And I'm pretty sure you can handle it.

829
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:55,125
How long should I be there, Dad?

830
01:04:55,208 --> 01:05:00,208
How long did it take for you to develop
your noodle business?

831
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:05,708
A week.

832
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,041
Right. That means
it's more or less the same thing.

833
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:16,416
But of course if you need more time,
and you need to stay longer,

834
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:22,125
then you could always ask your girlfriend
to catch up with you,

835
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,666
and you can get married there.

836
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,583
Why not?

837
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,791
Everything can be arranged.

838
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:43,708
Don't worry about your mother.
I'll talk to her later.

839
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:53,208
Son...

840
01:05:54,291 --> 01:05:55,375
It's nothing.

841
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,666
Just finish your meal. Go on.

842
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:04,000
<i>It seems that love
isn't just about being together</i>

843
01:06:05,083 --> 01:06:07,083
<i>or merely just an expression,</i>

844
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,958
<i>but it's also a blessing in disguise</i>

845
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:15,000
<i>when we throw away all our desires.</i>

846
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,500
I didn't expect your father
to be that kind.

847
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,958
Same here.

848
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,333
<i>If you ask me</i>

849
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:25,875
<i>if this is the path for me,</i>

850
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,041
<i>maybe this will be my next choice.</i>

851
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:33,333
<i>For how long?</i>

852
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:36,083
<i>I don't know.</i>

853
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:40,250
<i>Please allow me to enjoy it first.</i>

854
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:42,666
No, you can't. Close your eyes.

855
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,458
- All right.
- Don't peek. Close your eyes.

856
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:49,041
Now you can open your eyes.

857
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,541
<i>I, Cristian Subagyo,</i>

858
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,750
and the woman beside me...

859
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,875
Yura Diandra,

860
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,250
will be getting married in two months.

861
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,250
And one more thing.

862
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,333
Because tonight is a very special night,

863
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:24,250
I will be treating all of you here
to Yoi Mie. Free of charge!

864
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:27,000
So order anything you like.

865
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,750
Go ahead, but please
don't bring it home, okay?

866
01:08:30,416 --> 01:08:31,416
Yura.

867
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,208
Why did you come here?

868
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:52,208
You're still not well, right?

869
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:54,125
He insisted on coming, Yura.

870
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:58,916
It was I who insisted.
Nisa didn't have the heart to say it.

871
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,791
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

872
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:10,666
Gerry Hartono!

873
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:13,916
Gerry!

874
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:16,041
Gerry!

875
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:32,541
<i>Oh, where</i>

876
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:38,666
<i>Should I look for you</i>

877
01:09:41,333 --> 01:09:45,250
<i>I am crying</i>

878
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:52,291
<i>All by myself</i>

879
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:58,333
<i>My heart</i>

880
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:05,041
<i>Is always longing to see you</i>

881
01:10:07,375 --> 01:10:11,500
<i>Just for you</i>

882
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:18,291
<i>I will sing this song</i>

883
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,708
<i>To my dearest father</i>

884
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:33,708
<i>I want to sing this song</i>

885
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,500
<i>Even though</i>

886
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:45,083
<i>Tears stream down on my face</i>

887
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:54,250
<i>Father, please listen to me</i>

888
01:10:54,791 --> 01:11:00,541
<i>I want to see you</i>

889
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,375
<i>Even though</i>

890
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:10,291
<i>It's only in my dreams</i>

891
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:36,208
<i>Just look...</i>

892
01:11:36,291 --> 01:11:37,291
All set.

893
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,833
Don't forget to come back.

894
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:42,500
- Okay?
- Sure.

895
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:44,833
Take care of Yura for me, okay?

896
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,166
I'd better go now, honey.

897
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,541
This is your mother's bracelet.

898
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:02,083
That's why I'm giving it to you.

899
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,000
Thank you.

900
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,166
Don't be sad. I won't be away for long.

901
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,708
Mr. and Mrs. Somad!

902
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,416
Have a safe flight!

903
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:32,916
Come back, okay?

904
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:43,416
Come on.

905
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:55,916
DEAR YURA, HOW ARE YOU?

906
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,791
LA FEELS A LOT COLDER WITHOUT YOU HERE.

907
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,291
MISSING YOU AND NOT SEEING YOU

908
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,750
IS LIKE COMPOSING A SONG
WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SUNG.

909
01:13:27,333 --> 01:13:28,333
Yura?

910
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,750
What's the matter?

911
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:32,500
I think I'm catching a cold.
I need to sleep.

912
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:34,083
Yura.

913
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:38,375
Mr. Burhan is missing.

914
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,500
What do you mean by missing?

915
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,083
He's missing. He never got home.

916
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,916
What do you mean?

917
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:47,250
They say there are a lot of activists
being abducted.

918
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,666
Abducted?

919
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,958
That's right. By the police.

920
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,916
The situation out there
is very terrifying.

921
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:57,416
Even college students have mobilized.

922
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,750
It's really scary out there...

923
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,708
- Oka!
- Yura?

924
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:05,750
- This is bad, right? Come here!
- What is it, Mom?

925
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:08,791
- This is bad, right?
- What are you talking about?

926
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:13,041
There are a lot of confusing words.
I don't understand this.

927
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:14,416
"Put forward..."

928
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,625
"Position..."

929
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:18,291
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. It's chaos out there.

930
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:19,833
I'll read it later.

931
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:56,791
PHARMACY

932
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:15,875
Reformation!

933
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:20,375
REFORMATION
BRING DOWN SOEHARTO'S REGIME!

934
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:37,166
CALL SHOP

935
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:39,583
The total is 1,000 rupiah.

936
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:41,333
Thank you very much.

937
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,291
Ian?

938
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:09,875
Where are you?

939
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,208
Are you okay?

940
01:16:16,416 --> 01:16:18,916
Please call me back.

941
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,458
I want to tell you something important.

942
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:50,791
You're already here?

943
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:52,625
- Yes.
- Put it in the back.

944
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,708
Sure.

945
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:02,833
Yura?

946
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:14,708
Give me his phone number.
Let me try to call him.

947
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:20,916
Give it to me.

948
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,500
It's really bad.

949
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,041
Oh, my god!

950
01:17:58,833 --> 01:17:59,833
What's that?

951
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:02,916
Oka!

952
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,166
Oka?

953
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:07,041
- Oka?
- Yes, Dad.

954
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,625
- Have you seen the news?
- No, I haven't. What's wrong?

955
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:15,375
Come here.

956
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,541
That's the situation in Jakarta
about an hour ago.

957
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:32,291
<i>Allegedly, the riot was caused
by angry passengers</i>

958
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:33,916
<i>who didn't receive any explanation</i>

959
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,500
<i>from the airlines regarding their flights.</i>

960
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,791
<i>Several properties like computers,
telephones, tables, chairs, walls,</i>

961
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:42,500
<i>and even windows were smashed
all around the counters.</i>

962
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:43,666
They burned it.

963
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,041
Where are you going, Yura?

964
01:18:57,541 --> 01:18:58,583
To Jakarta.

965
01:18:59,916 --> 01:19:01,041
Are you crazy?

966
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:03,041
Oka!

967
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:05,958
I want to know where Tian is right now!

968
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,181
I want to know what his parents will say!

969
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:11,125
But not like this, Yura!
Didn't you see the situation in Jakarta?

970
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:13,250
What am I supposed to do?

971
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:16,333
Sit here and do nothing?

972
01:19:17,375 --> 01:19:18,458
Like a fool?

973
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:30,375
All right, let me take you there.

974
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:32,250
I'm going alone.

975
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:37,666
How do you plan to do that?
By plane or by train?

976
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,250
Didn't you see what was going on?

977
01:19:41,208 --> 01:19:42,208
Let's go.

978
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:09,458
REFORMATION IS A MUST

979
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,416
THIS BELONGS TO THE NATIVES

980
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
- Turn left up here, Oka.
- Here?

981
01:20:18,041 --> 01:20:20,125
There it is. That's the front gate.

982
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,541
Are you serious?

983
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:23,708
Is this really his house?

984
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:31,125
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

985
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:35,208
- Is this the house, Yura?
- Yes.

986
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:37,000
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

987
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,333
- Can I help you?
- I'm Yura.

988
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:41,291
I'm Cristian's friend who came here
last time. Do you remember?

989
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:45,958
The young master has many friends,
especially girls.

990
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:49,666
- I agree.
- That's right!

991
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:52,083
- What's going on here?
- Grace!

992
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,916
What a coincidence.
I want to ask how Cristian is doing.

993
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,125
Who are you?

994
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:00,458
What?

995
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:03,666
I'm Yura, Cristian's would-be wife!

996
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:08,041
A week ago, a woman also came here
and claimed to be Cristian's wife.

997
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:09,458
What is this?

998
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:12,125
I've gotten used to handling
these kinds of dramas.

999
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:16,083
The family here moved to America
before the riots began.

1000
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:17,583
So there's no one here.

1001
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,041
If you really are Master Cristian's
would-be wife,

1002
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:23,208
I'm sure you'll be in America by now,

1003
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,250
because his wedding
will be held next week.

1004
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:27,142
- Take care of this.
- Cristian...

1005
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:28,208
What wedding, ma'am?

1006
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,000
- She's his fiancée.
- He already proposed!

1007
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:31,083
- Ma'am!
- Go on now.

1008
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:33,708
- Hey, you are trespassing!
- Out of my way!

1009
01:21:33,791 --> 01:21:35,291
- Mister!
- Just get out of here!

1010
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:36,916
- Grace!
- Just leave at once!

1011
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,666
Don't force your way in! Hey!

1012
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:42,125
Listen to me!

1013
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:45,000
If you want to be a con artist,
do it at home. Don't do it here!

1014
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:46,083
Get out!

1015
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:49,041
Let's go, Yura.

1016
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:50,000
They're crazy.

1017
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:53,500
NATIVE INDONESIANS

1018
01:21:53,583 --> 01:22:00,583
THIS BELONGS TO THE NATIVES

1019
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:08,083
<i>The most useless thing in life</i>

1020
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:12,625
<i>is regretting a decision</i>

1021
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:17,041
<i>and then seeing yourself</i>

1022
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:21,125

Yura!

1025
01:22:58,791 --> 01:23:02,375
Yura, you haven't eaten yet, right?
Come on, let's eat.

1026
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:03,833
Look, I made you some noodles.

1027
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:08,041
Look, Yura. The egg is cooked over medium.

1028
01:23:08,541 --> 01:23:09,541
Look.

1029
01:23:51,416 --> 01:23:54,541
Can you tell Yura to come
and eat dinner, honey?

1030
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,875
Sure, I'll do that.

1031
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:03,833
Yura!

1032
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:05,750
Let's eat.

1033
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,500
Yura?

1034
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,041
Let's have dinner.

1035
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:12,250
Yura?

1036
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:16,833
Yura?

1037
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:21,666
Maybe she's sleeping.

1038
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:48,125
<i>Yura!</i>

1039
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:52,500
Yura?

1040
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:54,458
Wake up, Yura!
Come and eat your breakfast.

1041
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,875
We're going to have a guest from Jogja.

1042
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:01,500
Yura?

1043
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:09,166
Yura!

1044
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,500
Yura!

1045
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,416
Yura?

1046
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:27,750
Mom! Dad!

1047
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:31,708
Yura!

1048
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:32,791
Yura!

1049
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:37,166
Yura!

1050
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:55,041
Tian.

1051
01:25:56,916 --> 01:25:58,125
Please pick up.

1052
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:02,666
- How is she, Doc?
- She's recovering, ma'am.

1053
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,791
She lost a lot of blood,

1054
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:09,208
but good thing she was brought here
just in time, so she will survive.

1055
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:13,083
And thank God her baby is okay.

1056
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:15,166
Baby?

1057
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,416
Yes. Your daughter is two months pregnant.

1058
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:21,500
Can I speak to her husband?

1059
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,541
I'm her husband, Doc.

1060
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:25,625
Come with me.

1061
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:37,833
Is that true?

1062
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:46,541
This is not like Ian.

1063
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,291
I know him pretty well.

1064
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,625
I don't believe
he has the heart to do this.

1065
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:03,291
I'm sure this is all his parents' doing.
I'm sure of it.

1066
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,416
Okay, that's enough.

1067
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,625
What did the doctor say about Yura?

1068
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:11,541
I don't believe that he's wicked.

1069
01:27:13,208 --> 01:27:14,041
What?

1070
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:15,708
What did the doctor say?

1071
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:17,791
He told me

1072
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:20,875
Yura is having severe depression.

1073
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:26,291
So I need to take care of her
and keep her emotions stable.

1074
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:42,125
Come on. Wake up, Yura.

1075
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:48,125
We are all here for you.

1076
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,625
We all love you, Yura.

1077
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:06,208
We are here for you.

1078
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:21,958
Yura?

1079
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:28,500
Yura?

1080
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:32,000
Yura?

1081
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:37,083
Yura?

1082
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:40,166
- Got you!
- Yura!

1083
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,458
You better watch out!
I'm going to catch you!

1084
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:45,750
I'm going to tickle you!

1085
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:50,041
You are precious to me!

1086
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:54,166
Mom.

1087
01:28:56,208 --> 01:28:58,750
Are you afraid of losing me?

1088
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:03,166
I am so afraid of losing you.

1089
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:06,291
Your mother Diandra and our father Gerry
both have this bracelet.

1090
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:17,083
When you were born,
her bracelet was given to you.

1091
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:25,583
Now, you can also have Dad's bracelet.

1092
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,916
Please don't be sad anymore, Yura.

1093
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:40,291
You're not alone, you know?

1094
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,750
We're all here for you.

1095
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:52,750
<i>Sometimes...</i>

1096
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:56,625
<i>when we really feel
we have lost everything,</i>

1097
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:01,791
<i>the people we used to hate
and stay away from,</i>

1098
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,875
<i>are the ones who will be there for us.</i>

1099
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:31,666
Yura.

1100
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,333
May I speak to you for a minute?

1101
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:47,833
When your father and I got married,

1102
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,333
honestly,

1103
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:54,875
I didn't know how to be a mother to you.

1104
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:00,916
Maybe it's because
I've never had a child before.

1105
01:33:02,625 --> 01:33:05,666
That's why I didn't know what to do.

1106
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:09,541
When Nisa was born,

1107
01:33:11,166 --> 01:33:12,375
I thought...

1108
01:33:14,208 --> 01:33:17,791
I could have a little experience
on how to deal with children.

1109
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:21,958
But...

1110
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:27,000
But it made me drift
even farther away from you.

1111
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:33,916
I don't know why,

1112
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:37,500
but you were like a nuisance to me...

1113
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,458
especially when your father
wasn't successful anymore.

1114
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,416
His album sold poorly on the market.

1115
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,458
They didn't offer him opportunities
to perform anymore.

1116
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,833
Meanwhile, our needs have increased.

1117
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:06,166
And then I tried something else
to help our family.

1118
01:34:08,416 --> 01:34:13,041
I tried starting a business,
selling jewelry to wealthy people.

1119
01:34:14,791 --> 01:34:18,375
That's when I met Mrs. Sadewo, until...

1120
01:34:27,916 --> 01:34:29,250
That's why I...

1121
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:42,416
Your fate should've been
much better than this, Yura.

1122
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:46,500
This is all my fault.

1123
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:50,041
I am the one who caused all of this.

1124
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,833
I have accepted this fate.

1125
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,916
You have to be happy, okay?

1126
01:35:37,583 --> 01:35:41,541
Whatever it takes,
I will atone for my sins.

1127
01:35:48,958 --> 01:35:50,416
Please forgive me.

1128
01:35:56,291 --> 01:35:57,875
Hi. It hasn't started yet?

1129
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,333
It's going to start soon.

1130
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:04,000
Mrs. Indah, my grandma wants me
to give this to Yura.

1131
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:05,083
<i>Akar fatimah.</i>

1132
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:06,875
What's that for?

1133
01:36:06,958 --> 01:36:11,250
<i>Akar fatimah</i> is very good
at inducing labor, Yura.

1134
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:13,000
I'll boil it for her at home later.

1135
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:15,958
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

1136
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:19,250
please sit on the available mat
in the middle.

1137
01:36:19,333 --> 01:36:20,500
- Wait here, okay?
- Okay.

1138
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,750
Just walk slowly.

1139
01:36:27,416 --> 01:36:30,208
Yura, where is your husband?

1140
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:34,250
- This is her husband, ma'am.
- Right.

1141
01:36:34,333 --> 01:36:36,583
Come on. It's all right.

1142
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:38,291
- Please sit down, sir.
- Come on.

1143
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:40,416
Just sit there.

1144
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:44,375
So what are your plans
for the future, Yura?

1145
01:37:55,666 --> 01:37:58,958
Giving birth and raising this child.

1146
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:05,958
Maybe I'll go to college again.

1147
01:38:10,583 --> 01:38:11,958
Isn't it cute

1148
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
bringing my baby to class?

1149
01:38:20,958 --> 01:38:23,541
It's getting late. I need to go home now.

1150
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:28,125
Give my regards to the little one.

1151
01:38:37,541 --> 01:38:38,958
Hey, handsome.

1152
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:52,541
How much? One portion?

1153
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,500
I think Oka is the perfect guy
to be your husband.

1154
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:04,083
That's nonsense.

1155
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:07,125
What's wrong with that?

1156
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:10,000
You and Cristian
aren't officially married, right?

1157
01:39:10,083 --> 01:39:12,583
Yes, but that's just ridiculous.

1158
01:39:13,125 --> 01:39:15,416
Oka has been my friend
since the beginning.

1159
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:20,583
Well, I don't want to burden him
with my problems.

1160
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:23,375
Have you asked him about that?

1161
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:26,666
I don't have to ask him.
I'm sure everyone understands that.

1162
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:30,875
Yura, when a man has fallen in love,

1163
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:34,833
I'm sure he'll sacrifice
just about anything.

1164
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:49,916
She doesn't believe that?
Do you need proof?

1165
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,291
No, I don't.

1166
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:54,083
All right then, at least ask him, okay?

1167
01:39:54,166 --> 01:39:56,125
- Just ask him, okay?
- I don't want to.

1168
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:58,958
Just ask him. It will be fine, okay?

1169
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:00,625
I won't be asking him.

1170
01:40:05,958 --> 01:40:07,000
Mom!

1171
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:11,166
- What's wrong, Yura?
- Her water broke.

1172
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,583
Nisa, call a cab, okay?

1173
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:13,583
Oka!

1174
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:14,791
Yura, are you okay?

1175
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:16,833
- Oka, her water just broke!
- What?

1176
01:40:16,916 --> 01:40:17,916
Come here! Quick!

1177
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:20,250
Honey, please stay calm. Oka!

1178
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:22,208
- Quickly, call a cab.
- What's wrong, Yura?

1179
01:40:23,125 --> 01:40:24,000
Come on.

1180
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:26,708
Hello, Mom? Yes, she just went
into the operating room.

1181
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,291
It might take two hours.

1182
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:31,375
Mom, please bring Yura's clothes, okay?

1183
01:40:32,666 --> 01:40:34,916
Yes, and also her towel.
Bring a clean one, okay?

1184
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,458
You can also bring a perfume.

1185
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:39,250
Thank you.

1186
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,041
Come on, just relax.
Yura is strong, you know?

1187
01:40:42,625 --> 01:40:45,166
The important thing
is she doesn't feel alone.

1188
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:49,500
Yura's mother, please accompany
your daughter inside.

1189
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,708
Can her husband come too?

1190
01:40:51,791 --> 01:40:55,166
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Only one person is allowed inside.

1191
01:40:56,041 --> 01:40:57,958
- Then her husband should go in.
- Why me?

1192
01:40:58,041 --> 01:41:00,166
- It has to be you.
- Why doesn't he want to go?

1193
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:01,541
He wants to accompany her!

1194
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,500
- Go! He's coming, Nurse.
- Okay, this way.

1195
01:41:03,583 --> 01:41:04,750
He really wants to go.

1196
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:05,916
- Now.
- Why don't you?

1197
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,333
Go on, it's okay.
He wants to accompany her, Nurse.

1198
01:41:08,416 --> 01:41:11,791
- Come on, just get inside!
- Let's go, sir. They're waiting for us.

1199
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:13,166
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1200
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:16,583
Just relax, ma'am.

1201
01:41:16,666 --> 01:41:18,541
- First, I need to check it.
- Come on, sir.

1202
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:21,958
The dilation is now nine centimeters.
Just relax.

1203
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:23,375
Just relax, ma'am.

1204
01:41:23,458 --> 01:41:24,916
It's your first time, right?

1205
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,833
Please come in, sir. Go ahead.

1206
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:28,541
Take a deep breath.

1207
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:30,791
Now, push.

1208
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:34,375
- You can get close to her.
- Please help her out, okay?

1209
01:41:34,875 --> 01:41:36,291
Just a moment, sir.

1210
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:02,666
You're almost there, ma'am.
Just a bit more.

1211
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,708
Take another deep breath.

1212
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:35,541
The baby's born, ma'am! It's a girl!

1213
01:42:39,083 --> 01:42:40,208
Is the baby born, Mom?

1214
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:15,250
- Here you go!
- Thank you, Nisa.

1215
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:16,958
- Here you go, Mr. Somad.
- Thank you.

1216
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:18,916
And this is for you.

1217
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,142
- Mom, can you help with this?
- Sure.

1218
01:43:20,166 --> 01:43:22,000
- I need to help Yura.
- All right, honey.

1219
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:24,000
Please drink it.

1220
01:43:31,791 --> 01:43:33,958
Hello.

1221
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,708
What are you going to call her?

1222
01:43:44,416 --> 01:43:46,916
You haven't given her a name
since we left the hospital.

1223
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,791
That's right.
What are you going to call her?

1224
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:52,625
A name is a parent's wish, Yura.
Isn't that right, Gerry?

1225
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:55,791
Your cheeks are so chubby.

1226
01:43:55,875 --> 01:43:59,500
Hi. What is your name?

1227
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,916
What do you think, Oka?

1228
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,500
Why are you asking me?

1229
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,458
You're her mother.

1230
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:07,666
I can't give her a name.

1231
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:09,916
You're good at choosing a name.

1232
01:44:10,791 --> 01:44:12,875
You're the one who named our stall.

1233
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:15,541
- And it's very profitable.
- Hey.

1234
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:17,250
Hold on a second.

1235
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:21,500
How can you name this beautiful baby
like some stall?

1236
01:44:22,083 --> 01:44:24,833
- That's right! Don't do that.
- What do you mean by that?

1237
01:44:24,916 --> 01:44:25,916
All right then.

1238
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:29,166
What's her name then?

1239
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:35,000
Diandra...

1240
01:44:36,875 --> 01:44:38,000
Puspita.

1241
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,791
Look, she smiled. Diandra Puspita.

1242
01:44:44,625 --> 01:44:45,541
What does it mean?

1243
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:49,416
Diandra is the name of Yura's late mother.

1244
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:52,916
It means elegant and strong.

1245
01:44:54,583 --> 01:44:58,208
This child will grow
to become a very beautiful girl,

1246
01:44:58,291 --> 01:45:00,958
and strong like her mother
and grandmother.

1247
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:06,125
Diandra Puspita Hartono.

1248
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:09,375
- It's a good name, right?
- Yes, it's good.

1249
01:45:11,291 --> 01:45:13,000
Diandra Puspita...

1250
01:45:14,291 --> 01:45:15,500
Saputra?

1251
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,958
I know this will sound ridiculous.

1252
01:45:33,083 --> 01:45:34,083
But...

1253
01:45:36,791 --> 01:45:39,416
I can't deny my feelings anymore.

1254
01:45:45,166 --> 01:45:48,875
I want to have a happy family
like Mr. and Mrs. Somad...

1255
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:55,000
who can give birth
to an amazing child like Oka.

1256
01:45:59,791 --> 01:46:03,458
I know this will sound very weird...

1257
01:46:03,541 --> 01:46:04,625
A woman...

1258
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:09,250
A woman proposing to a man first.

1259
01:46:14,916 --> 01:46:16,250
But one thing's for sure...

1260
01:46:24,250 --> 01:46:27,583
I'm very happy to have a friend like you.

1261
01:46:33,833 --> 01:46:35,833
The person who I have chosen

1262
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:39,500
to give my future to.

1263
01:46:44,583 --> 01:46:47,708
But if you refuse, I don't mind either.

1264
01:46:49,875 --> 01:46:51,791
I don't want you to think

1265
01:46:53,666 --> 01:46:56,125
that I'm giving my burden to you.

1266
01:47:21,833 --> 01:47:23,375
I don't know what to say, Yura.

1267
01:47:36,375 --> 01:47:38,333
You don't need to answer now, Oka.

1268
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:44,750
I sincerely accept it.

1269
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:52,125
I still consider you my best friend.

1270
01:48:04,041 --> 01:48:07,125
Hey, let's get out of here.
Why are we still here anyway?

1271
01:48:07,208 --> 01:48:08,625
We need to wait for Yura.

1272
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:11,458
It's all done, right?

1273
01:48:11,541 --> 01:48:12,875
Yura's marriage has been set.

1274
01:48:13,791 --> 01:48:16,833
Whatever happens, she's still our friend.
We need to protect her.

1275
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:19,916
- What if something happens to her?
- What will happen to her?

1276
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,166
Well, anything can happen to her.

1277
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:23,833
Why aren't you concerned at all?

1278
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:26,875
All right, whatever.

1279
01:48:29,875 --> 01:48:31,416
Quickly, start the car!

1280
01:48:32,875 --> 01:48:35,041
- What happened?
- Just go now, Oka!

1281
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:45,375
I promise you...

1282
01:48:47,166 --> 01:48:49,083
I will never hurt your feelings.

1283
01:49:02,541 --> 01:49:03,708
Yura! Mom!

1284
01:49:11,458 --> 01:49:13,583
I love you, Yura.

1285
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:31,375
I accept it, Yura.

1286
01:49:31,458 --> 01:49:35,250
I accept that this child will be named
Diandra Puspita Saputra.

1287
01:49:54,916 --> 01:49:56,916
Come and give me a hug!

1288
01:49:59,666 --> 01:50:03,083
Finally, I have a granddaughter
from the Hartono family!

1289
01:50:04,291 --> 01:50:08,208
- Why are you crying, Dad?
- You made me cry!

1290
01:50:16,708 --> 01:50:18,041
<i>Once again,</i>

1291
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:21,750
<i>love isn't just about being together
or just an expression,</i>

1292
01:50:23,041 --> 01:50:25,583
<i>nor is it just a wish
for a blessing to come.</i>

1293
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:29,500
<i>Love is all things.</i>

1294
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:33,833
<i>There's also sacrifice in love.</i>

1295
01:50:35,791 --> 01:50:38,000
<i>There's always something to fight for.</i>

1296
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:40,958
<i>Not just our desires alone,</i>

1297
01:50:42,291 --> 01:50:45,541
<i>but all the people
who sincerely helped us.</i>

1298
01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:03,958
<i>Will this be the ending of my love story?</i>

1299
01:51:05,583 --> 01:51:06,708
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

1300
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,333
<i>Once again, please allow me
to enjoy it first.</i>

1301
01:51:46,208 --> 01:51:47,208
Excuse me.

1302
01:51:47,875 --> 01:51:48,875
Can I help you?

1303
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:56,458
I can take it from here.

1304
01:51:57,583 --> 01:51:59,166
Ian, what happened to your face?

1305
01:52:04,708 --> 01:52:05,708
Ian?
