1
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:13,290
The Hinterland

2
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:07,262
Algeria isn't just a picturesque region

3
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:12,262
used by caravans with no camels...

4
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:49,661
… but also a land of prodigious

5
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:53,681
industrial and commercial activity

6
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:44,426
… and of great agricultural richness.

7
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,556
Algiers

8
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,814
That day the mail boat from Marseille

9
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:58,814
brought to Algiers a young man

10
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:01,523
who had spent a large inheritance.

11
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:37,296
… and a young girl on her way to collect

12
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:41,293
an inheritance from an uncle in Algiers.

13
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:12,317
Pierre Hoffer, the big spender,

14
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:15,317
liked a lot Claudin Duvernet,

15
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,453
who was about to inherit.

16
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Manuel Duvernet and his sister Diane,

17
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,660
Claudie's cousins, were firmly

18
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,824
counting on the inheritance.

19
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:28,008
Sometimes one is happy to meet

20
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,008
old friends from the regiment ;

21
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:35,899
Pierre was thrilled to meet Zoubir.

22
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:50,408
No way you're staying at a hotel !

23
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:52,705
You're staying with me.

24
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:11,445
The Duvernet family's lawyer...

25
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:24,638
"… and I appoint as sole legatee

26
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:27,074
my niece Claudie."

27
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:03,292
Your old uncle didn't forget you.

28
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,934
He has paid your debts.

29
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Miss, you're inheriting

30
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,923
a villa at Sidi Ferruch.

31
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,800
… and in the south, a large esate.

32
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:32,404
Since the car now belongs to you,

33
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:37,400
you can do the driving.

34
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:09,146
… I wish the voyage would have

35
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:12,146
lasted another hour ; I was in love.

36
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:16,638
To think that I will never see her again!

37
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,916
Pierre Hoffer had agreed to

38
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:25,415
temporarily stay with his friend Zoubir.

39
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,561
I'm starting to think that one

40
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:01,012
doesn't necessarily have to be

41
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:04,012
a sucker to get married.

42
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:13,128
As for money matters... I'm counting

43
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:16,128
on my uncle Christian Hoffer.

44
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:20,612
He's the reason why I'm coming to Algeria.

45
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:29,497
Christian Hoffer is rich,

46
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,792
but he's of an odd sort.

47
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,607
You may end up being disappointed.

48
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:44,693
I was two years old when he saw me last.

49
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:48,837
He's kept an fond memory of me.

50
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:11,693
At Sidi Ferruch, the villa

51
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:13,796
that Claudie Duvernet had inherited.

52
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:18,914
Christian Hoffer, Pierre's uncle, had come

53
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:21,914
to Algeria as a poor man.

54
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:24,914
Now he had become one of

55
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:28,006
the richest farmers of the region.

56
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:50,000
The Hoffer farm is here, right ?

57
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:34,591
Tell me, my good man,

58
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:37,844
do you know Christian Hoffer ?

59
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:49,084
Slightly. That's me !

60
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:18,530
You're my nephew ?

61
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,185
Dinner time at the Hoffer farm.

62
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,359
Hold your appetite !

63
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,359
We're waiting for my nephew

64
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,617
who just arrived from Paris.

65
00:25:25,678 --> 00:25:31,364
Why on earth are you dressed as a waiter ?

66
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:59,490
Meanwhile, in Claudie Duvernet's villa.

67
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:47,482
Why are you drinking like that ?

68
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
Do you have those

69
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,260
72.000 francs that I owe ?

70
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:49,713
There is a way to get that money...

71
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:00,525
But you don't have any vigor !

72
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:03,022
Oh, if I was only a man...

73
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,785
Madam is served.

74
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:34,076
Pardon miss, but that is the place

75
00:31:34,076 --> 00:31:37,549
of the mistress of the house.

76
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:31,510
The next morning, Christian Hoffer

77
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,510
had decided he would have

78
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,830
his nephew see his farmland.

79
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:49,806
So lazybones, you still

80
00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:51,450
think you are in Paris ?

81
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:04,357
We're going to watch the ploughing,

82
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,553
so don't put on a tox.

83
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:03,148
Let's go.

84
00:34:03,148 --> 00:34:06,150
Today he's dressed like a fool.

85
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,639
It seemed a simple thing to ask

86
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,639
Christian Hoffer for money from afar.

87
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,908
In person, it seemed different...

88
00:34:57,363 --> 00:34:59,730
How much ?

89
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,056
A hundred thousand.

90
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:29,778
I will pay you back... naturally.

91
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,650
Do you have any idea how much

92
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:00,650
work it takes us to raise

93
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,080
a hundred thousand francs ?

94
00:36:07,496 --> 00:36:09,496
A hundred years ago,

95
00:36:09,496 --> 00:36:11,496
our predecessors found nothing

96
00:36:11,496 --> 00:36:13,789
but swampland here.

97
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:35,184
Before it was transformed into

98
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:38,184
fertile soil; thousands of settlers

99
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:40,947
died during the effort.

100
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:51,713
While they were here, our

101
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:56,117
grandfathers needed better roads.

102
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:01,901
That's why we were waiting

103
00:37:01,901 --> 00:37:04,980
for you to turn up, son.

104
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:58,009
It was here, at Sidi Ferruch, that

105
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,936
the French troops disembarked in 1830.

106
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:43,745
You will have your hundred

107
00:41:43,745 --> 00:41:46,730
thousand francs, but on one condition...

108
00:41:57,954 --> 00:42:00,954
That you spend six months

109
00:42:00,954 --> 00:42:03,954
working here, in order to learn

110
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,069
the value of hard labor.

111
00:42:58,316 --> 00:42:59,916
Agreed !

112
00:43:10,243 --> 00:43:12,539
A week went by...

113
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,538
Hey ! You over there !

114
00:44:01,924 --> 00:44:03,924
What can you do? There's a shortage

115
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:06,924
on labor in Algeria, they say.

116
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:30,064
What a lovely day !

117
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,510
Claudie, I have to speak with

118
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:58,510
my uncle... I must talk

119
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,632
to him right away !

120
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,719
What fair weather !

121
00:51:11,806 --> 00:51:14,806
Uncle, I have decided to marry.

122
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:39,491
And with whom ?

123
00:51:44,783 --> 00:51:47,783
With Claudie Duvernet.

124
00:52:17,728 --> 00:52:20,728
And you claimed that you loved

125
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:23,728
the earth. A woman passes by

126
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:27,014
and you are ready to go.

127
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:36,072
Because you will follow her

128
00:52:36,072 --> 00:52:39,072
to Paris as soon as she

129
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,212
has sold the property, right ?

130
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,416
And I thought that I had

131
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,416
found a son in you...

132
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:06,504
What will become of me?

133
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,529
Claudie Duvernet had decided

134
00:54:04,529 --> 00:54:07,529
to go visit the farmland

135
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:09,508
that she owned in the South.

136
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:42,811
Pierre had apparently

137
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:45,168
abandoned his projects.

138
00:55:19,756 --> 00:55:22,756
I come to say goodbye, I'm

139
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:25,190
leaving for the South tomorrow.

140
00:55:38,378 --> 00:55:41,378
Claudie Duvernet left yesterday.

141
00:55:41,378 --> 00:55:44,378
We'll need to make up a plot

142
00:55:44,378 --> 00:55:48,877
so that I can accompany you.

143
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:06,602
You are buying sheep ; Zoubir

144
00:56:06,602 --> 00:56:09,602
is selling just that on his farm.

145
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:12,398
He's leaving tonight.

146
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:30,919
Alright, then ! We'll go see the flock.

147
00:56:38,754 --> 00:56:42,754
In the meantime, Claudie arrived at

148
00:56:42,754 --> 00:56:45,360
the estate inherited from her uncle.

149
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:05,361
ESTATE FOR SALE

150
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:27,401
This farm is giving no profit. We put it

151
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:30,401
on sale at our uncle's death. We thought

152
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:34,032
that we were doing the right thing.

153
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:18,075
Claudie Duvernet is the one that

154
00:58:18,075 --> 00:58:21,075
you need to ask for instructions.

155
00:58:21,075 --> 00:58:24,223
The estate belongs to her.

156
00:59:06,436 --> 00:59:10,436
Claudie was taken with her new domain.

157
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:14,436
She discovered unknown distractions

158
00:59:14,436 --> 00:59:17,354
thanks to the falconer Ahmed.

159
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:58,939
To think that the domain would be

160
00:59:58,939 --> 01:00:01,939
ours if it wasn't for that girl.

161
01:00:01,939 --> 01:00:04,209
Still we can do nothing to her...

162
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:16,020
At Zoubir's place...

163
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:15,468
You were talking about a gazelle hunt.

164
01:01:15,468 --> 01:01:18,468
Can't you invite my uncle and Claudie ?

165
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:21,883
I want them to get acquainted.

166
01:01:35,315 --> 01:01:38,315
Very good! I'll join you.

167
01:02:43,507 --> 01:02:48,507
I would gladly spend my whole life here.

168
01:04:07,465 --> 01:04:11,465
I hope that your cousins

169
01:04:11,465 --> 01:04:14,465
will do me the honor of

170
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:17,812
joining the hunt as well.

171
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:35,060
I would be glad to,

172
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:38,060
but my brother can't.

173
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,542
He's busy that day.

174
01:05:14,253 --> 01:05:17,253
Why don't you want me

175
01:05:17,253 --> 01:05:20,785
to take part in the hunt ?

176
01:05:22,698 --> 01:05:27,698
You probably have better things to do.

177
01:05:35,762 --> 01:05:38,762
That girl robbed us ! We should

178
01:05:38,762 --> 01:05:41,762
have gotten the inheritance.

179
01:05:41,762 --> 01:05:43,668
We will get it in the end !

180
01:06:04,785 --> 01:06:07,411
What if I married Claudie ?

181
01:06:32,448 --> 01:06:34,448
Leaving for the hunt.

182
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:51,817
This time there's no going back.

183
01:06:51,817 --> 01:06:54,375
You're not chickening out ?

184
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:01,092
You think you're clever because

185
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:04,092
you forced me into meeting

186
01:09:04,092 --> 01:09:07,860
that girl that I didn't want to see.

187
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:32,189
But that's your driver.

188
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:34,863
You brought him to the hunt ?

189
01:09:38,954 --> 01:09:42,954
He's an excellent beater.

190
01:10:09,287 --> 01:10:12,287
I even advice you to take him

191
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:15,754
with you during the hunt.

192
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:33,467
Claudie Duvernet's horse had taken

193
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:36,382
the bit between its teeth ...

194
01:16:38,228 --> 01:16:41,228
What a disgraceful thing we have done.

195
01:16:41,228 --> 01:16:44,647
This form of hunting is barbarous...

196
01:16:55,008 --> 01:16:58,008
If you are tired, I can

197
01:16:58,008 --> 01:17:02,405
take you to the citadel, miss.

198
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:16,432
I'm dying...

199
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:19,432
I want to clear my conscience...

200
01:19:19,432 --> 01:19:22,093
I have done a misdeed.

201
01:19:35,339 --> 01:19:39,339
I am in a hopeless situation, Claudie...

202
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:42,459
Only you can save me.

203
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:04,336
You must marry me.

204
01:20:19,706 --> 01:20:22,706
You are in my power, and

205
01:20:22,706 --> 01:20:25,002
I am prepared to do anything.

206
01:20:29,675 --> 01:20:32,675
I will kill you if I have to.

207
01:21:04,744 --> 01:21:08,744
By the palm grove...

208
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:11,133
You could still catch him...

209
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:14,410
This kidnapping story is

210
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:17,410
just another set-up. You'll have

211
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:21,235
to choose between the girl and me.

212
01:24:57,495 --> 01:25:01,495
For the last time, will you marry

213
01:25:01,495 --> 01:25:04,225
me or do you prefer to die ?

214
01:27:43,989 --> 01:27:46,989
The chamel wadi went to

215
01:27:46,989 --> 01:27:49,010
block the road for the fugitives.

216
01:29:31,455 --> 01:29:35,455
Sell me your dromedary. This young girl

217
01:29:35,455 --> 01:29:37,897
is wounded, her life is in danger...

218
01:32:42,219 --> 01:32:45,219
The horses are exhausted.

219
01:32:45,219 --> 01:32:48,219
They can't go on in the sand.

220
01:32:48,219 --> 01:32:52,000
Make your falcon attack the dromedary!

221
01:41:06,299 --> 01:41:09,299
Where did the engaged couple go ?

222
01:43:17,302 --> 01:43:19,302
Look at that !

223
01:43:19,302 --> 01:43:22,711
Today he's dressed as a farmer.

224
01:43:47,202 --> 01:43:50,998
