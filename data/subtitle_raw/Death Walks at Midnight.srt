1
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,433
- Good evening, Miss.
- Good evening.

2
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:13,328
You're in press photography,
is the stocks story true?

3
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:15,240
- Is that what the paper says?
- Yes.

4
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:16,835
- It's not true then!

5
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:00,295
- She probably hasn't got home yet.
- She's in.

6
00:03:14,854 --> 00:03:17,721
- HiValentina, how are you?
- Fine, and you?

7
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:20,419
- Doctor Donati and his assistant.
- Nice to meet you.

8
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,521
- Make yourselves at home.
-Thank you.

9
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:24,422
Thanks.

10
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:27,931
-What?
- First...

11
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:34,337
- It's 300 grand.
- Fine.

12
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,746
Isn't that too much?
Won't that be dangerous?

13
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:47,551
Don't worry, Miss.
My future depends on that.

14
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:51,257
- Gio, none of my face.
- Relax.

15
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:56,956
No-one'll recognise you with this on,
come on, lay down.

16
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:02,701
- Is it right?
- Yes.

17
00:04:03,136 --> 00:04:05,798
Come on.
Not the right arm, the left's better.

18
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,240
- Is it an intravenous?
- No, it's an intramuscular.

19
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,140
-You don't have to watch.
- I won't.

20
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:12,842
- Put the mask on.
-Yes.

21
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,007
Let's hope for the best.

22
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,350
- Please Gio, no names.
- Don't worry.

23
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,858
She doesn't want to tell us her name,
it doesn't matter.

24
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:29,853
Profession: occasional fashion,
comic, top model...

25
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:35,563
Voluntarily under the medical supervision
of Professor...

26
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:37,868
-Your name?
- Donati.

27
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:41,273
Donati, of the University of Milan,
Faculty ofToxicology.

28
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,667
for an experiment
on a new hallucinogen, HDS.

29
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:52,278
The liquid's just been injected.
Let's see the effects.

30
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:56,587
- Let's start. How do you feel?
- I just feel hot so far.

31
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,687
Fine. She says that she just feels hot.

32
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:03,123
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two.

33
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:04,325
The truth, please...

34
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,467
-Twenty-eight.
- Right.

35
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,237
Listen dear, what are you looking for?

36
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:15,438
-Where?
-What do you want from life?

37
00:05:16,676 --> 00:05:19,941
Oh, from life...

38
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:26,045
...a purple ice-cream,just for me.

39
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,946
Valentina's started her trip.

40
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,052
- Gio, no names.
- Of course, no names.

41
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:38,252
-Valentina, are you okay with life?
- Of course I am.

42
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:46,066
-What do you like most?
- Music, church organs...

43
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:50,075
- ...and red priests.
- Red priests?

44
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,172
Yes, red priests!

45
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,771
Colours, colours...

46
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:03,515
And you... I don't like you:
you've got a monkey-face!

47
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:07,517
- A monkey-face?
- Colours, how lovely...

48
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:13,628
Come on, let's dance!
Dance with me, let's dance!

49
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,839
Colours, colours...

50
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:56,666
Oh my God! Not the face!

51
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,965
-What?
- Not the face!

52
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,864
What happens?

53
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:04,977
She... She...

54
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,884
He smashed her face in!

55
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,491
Go on, what do you see?

56
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,688
He killed her. He killed her!

57
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,792
Who? Who're you talking about?
What do you see now?

58
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,113
Stop him!

59
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:47,813
-Who? What are they doing?
- He smashed her face in!

60
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:51,022
What did you see?
How did he smash her face in?

61
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:53,582
A man...

62
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,994
-With an iron glove
-With what?!

63
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:57,487
With an iron glove!

64
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:06,133
Stop! Stop! Stop!

65
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,641
It's horrible, Gio, it's horrible!

66
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:17,543
What did you give me?
My father mustn't find out!

67
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:23,351
-What else can you see? Tell me!
- Murderer, murderer!

68
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,987
- Don't stop... Who's the murderer?
- Murderer, murderer!

69
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,895
He killed her!

70
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,621
- Good morning, Miss.
- Good morning.

71
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,925
-The Director was looking for you.
- I was going to see him.

72
00:10:03,963 --> 00:10:07,421
- Miss, the Director's asking for you.
- I know.

73
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:12,827
- Oh, miss, you're wanted by...
-The Director, I know.

74
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:20,439
- Director, you wanted me?
-Yes. You can go back home!

75
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:30,852
Damn! Bloody bastard!
Damn him, and the magazine!

76
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,668
The girl who tried
the new hallucinogen speaks...

77
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:54,175
Valentina on H.D.S:
'I saw a woman being murdered'.

78
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,373
Son of a bitch!

79
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,611
- You mean me?
- Of course!What happened to the mask?!

80
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:07,718
Be happy, it's all publicity.
I'd to justify the 300 grand.

81
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,228
Why did I trust a blockhead like you?

82
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,927
Because you love me, poor thing.

83
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:16,926
I had to do a shoot for a magazine
and they threw me out!

84
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:19,530
Alright, alright... Listen:

85
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:24,839
I'll take you out to dinner,
and then the night's ours.

86
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:26,943
- Come on, give me a kiss...
- Keep away!

87
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:28,937
I'd rather be a nun
than go to bed with you.

88
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:31,245
Interesting experience!

89
00:11:31,784 --> 00:11:33,752
I'll meet you in the convent, then!

90
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,651
- Are you crazy?
-What's going on?

91
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:44,054
And this would be the 'doctor'?

92
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:49,396
- You bloody...
- It's Italy! Accompany her out.

93
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:54,067
-You'll pay for this!!
- Calm down

94
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,371
Go back to your work.
What a mess...

95
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:08,111
- Come on!
- Let me go, leave me alone, you quack!

96
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:11,316
- I must talk to you, it's important!
- Don't bother me!

97
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:22,533
Here!

98
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:27,437
What's she doing?

99
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:29,841
Eat this!

100
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:35,143
- Hey girl, is that any way to behave?
-Wretch!

101
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,947
- Go get a job!
- Mind your own business! Bugger off!

102
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:03,500
Breakage of a window
by the throwing of a stone.

103
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:11,213
The act can be seen
as intimidatory to Novella 2000...

104
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,910
- Are you a fascist?
- Me?

105
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:14,614
- Communist?
- No.

106
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:17,818
So do you smash windows
for The Glaziers' Association?

107
00:13:19,058 --> 00:13:23,518
If Novella 2000 brings charges
you'll be in bother!

108
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:28,027
Sir, there's a gentleman
who wants to talk with you.

109
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,027
It's Gio Baldi,
a Novella 2000 journalist. Here.

110
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:37,542
See? Here comes trouble...

111
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:42,341
- Listen, Lieutenant. Get me a copy.
- Right away, sir

112
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,840
Come in, make yourself comfortable.

113
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:47,547
Valentina, do you know
it was double-glazed?

114
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,081
- You know each other?
We're a couple. She's jealous...

115
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:58,089
That stone was meant for me...

116
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,521
Luckily it hit the window!

117
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:04,231
Anyway, I'll pay.
And no legal action by the magazine.

118
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,538
- May we go?
- Is that true, Miss?

119
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,031
If he says so...

120
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,836
I believe you this time, but...

121
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,138
- Leave windows alone!
- Here it is, Sir.

122
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:23,449
Just a minute.What's this?

123
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,256
Oh, nothing.
It's a piece I wrote about H.D.S.

124
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:30,362
Drugs... And this is your girlfriend?

125
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:38,264
Do you believe that stuff, Inspector?
It's for the masses.

126
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:41,969
If it were true,
I wouldn't have used her!

127
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:46,672
- Is it really true?
-Yes... No... It's like he said.

128
00:14:47,313 --> 00:14:52,876
I hope so.
Drugs are worse than broken windows!

129
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:57,688
That goes for you too,journalist or not.
You can both go.

130
00:14:58,123 --> 00:15:01,923
-Thank you, Inspector. If you need me...
-You?

131
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:04,626
Come on, love.

132
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:07,825
Goodbye, inspector.

133
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:14,430
Giovanni Baldi.
Journalist. 32. Born in Seregno.

134
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:18,034
- See if there's anything in the archives.
- Right away, Sir.

135
00:15:18,577 --> 00:15:21,341
- Note that he graduated in Chemistry.
- How do you know?

136
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,145
It was on his ID card.

137
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:48,369
Hi.Welcome home.

138
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:52,675
Oh, it's you. Hi.

139
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:56,875
What enthusiasm!
I'll leave you if you prefer.

140
00:15:57,816 --> 00:16:02,310
If you want. Go, stay, do what you want.

141
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:06,120
That's what you call a warm welcome...

142
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:10,027
It's not a good day. I'm going.

143
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:12,826
I'll even leave you the keys
so I won't bother you anymore.

144
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:14,625
Oh, stop it.

145
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:19,526
I'd a bad time. Keep the keys and come whenever
you want.

146
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:24,338
You know, Stefano,
I should have married you.

147
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,044
Of course!

148
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:35,250
But we'd be having a terrible argument
about that article.

149
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:40,183
How often you'd have said:
''I shouldn't have married you""!

150
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:43,891
I should have been wearing a mask
during the experiment!

151
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:49,294
But isn't it the same thing
with or without a mask?

152
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:51,600
-What a bore!
- It's still you!

153
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,595
Sometimes you amaze me,
how can you still be so middle-class?

154
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,010
-What?
- I said you're still middle-class.

155
00:16:59,445 --> 00:16:59,911
Why?

156
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,748
''The revelations of the woman who tried H.D.S.''.

157
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:14,548
Listen to this...
''I saw an iron fist beating up a woman.

158
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:18,860
Sensational!
Here are the pictures of the experiment"".

159
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,962
What is this stuff?
Your journalist friend's bullshit?

160
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:28,769
No, it's all true.
You've no idea what it was like.

161
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,176
- No...
- It was my first time...

162
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,769
but there are people who take it for fun.

163
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,982
Someone's brought an urgent note for you.

164
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,485
Leave it there, I can't come right now.

165
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:41,886
Alright.

166
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:45,288
- Miss, I forgot the milk.
-What a surprise...

167
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:47,783
- I'll go and get it now.
- Fine.

168
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:52,889
''I saw the article in Novella 2000''.

169
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,700
Another one...
''I need you for a new product ad.

170
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:04,633
Would you come to flat 21
at 1 0, Via Lanciani at noon?

171
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:08,444
-Who's it from?
- It's not signed.

172
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,046
It'll be another rip-off.

173
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:13,747
Via Lanciani is just here,
do you want me to go?

174
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:20,647
- I'll find out what they want.
- No, I'll get ripped-off.

175
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,761
-What time is it?
- 1 1 ;20.

176
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:27,859
- I've got to get moving!
- Listen... I've got an idea.

177
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:33,164
- I'll take you out for lunch.
- Don't you work today?

178
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:37,166
- I'm not inspired.
- And what you do if you'll be inspired?

179
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,678
I'll think a while
and hope it'll go away!

180
00:18:41,613 --> 00:18:45,174
-You joker! I'll be right back.
- I'll wait for you.

181
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:04,325
Concierge? Concierge?
Not here, as usual...

182
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,774
Can I come in?

183
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,110
Is anyone here?

184
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:43,663
Stefano!

185
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,058
I'm over here!

186
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:51,362
Look over here... Please!

187
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:12,523
Come to Via Lanciani!
Ouickly, I'm in danger! I'm scared!

188
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,519
What're you doing up there?
What's wrong?

189
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:27,022
What do you mean?
Didn't you see him? He wanted to kill me!

190
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,629
Come down now.

191
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,998
-Who wanted to kill you?
-The man with the iron glove.

192
00:23:36,441 --> 00:23:39,899
- An iron glove?
-You must have seen him!

193
00:23:40,312 --> 00:23:44,009
-There was no-one there.
-What? Let's take a look...

194
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:50,720
- Are you serious?
- Look what he did with his iron glove.

195
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:55,215
- It was a lovely door...
- But, as I told you, I saw no-one.

196
00:23:56,361 --> 00:24:00,024
- How did you get in here?
- Explanation.

197
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,290
-The door was open.
- And you didn't see him?

198
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:05,493
He had black shades.

199
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:16,011
It's the effect of the shit you took...
Just for some cash.

200
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:19,517
What were you thinking of?

201
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:25,412
- It's not for you.
-Why don't you believe me?

202
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:29,524
When I arrived,
the concierge didn't want to let me in.

203
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:32,626
He said there was no-one here,
they'd moved out.

204
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,733
There was no-one here?
And where was I?

205
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:38,832
And who sent me this note?

206
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,635
Maybe it was a practical joke
by your friends,

207
00:24:43,174 --> 00:24:44,835
one of those lovely people you know...

208
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:48,639
Come on, let's go.

209
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:56,545
Include my name, Andrea Zamuto.
Never been in the papers!

210
00:24:57,188 --> 00:25:00,089
Well, well. Look who's here...

211
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:03,789
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

212
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:06,595
- I was looking for you.
- And why here, exactly?

213
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:09,000
It's the so-called 'scene of the crime'.

214
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:12,494
- One more word and he'll hit you!
- No... Calm down.

215
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:16,939
We're partners, aren't we?
There's more money to be made.

216
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:19,940
- Do you want an argument now?
- I don't understand you.

217
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:27,147
Next time they try to kill you
give me a call, right? Bye.

218
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:30,953
-Wait, Stefano.Where are you going?
-What? I'm going.

219
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,960
Come on dear, don't cry,
you'll see him again.

220
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:49,066
-Were you trying to be smart? You knew...
-What?

221
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:54,570
That a woman was murdered here
with an iron glove.

222
00:25:55,313 --> 00:25:59,477
-What the hell...?
- A woman was murdered here six months ago.

223
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:00,814
Six months ago?

224
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:03,621
Actually murdered?

225
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:11,552
Yes, and you must explain me
how you saw it the other day.

226
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:17,166
So that man up there was the real murderer?

227
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:19,565
I'm scared, Gio.

228
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:23,406
Me too. I'm scared
you're making a fool of me. You knew...

229
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:26,402
No! Do you think I'd have come here
if I had known?

230
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:29,712
- Let's have a drink, tell me everything.
- Leave me alone.

231
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,816
You saw the murderer
kill that woman six months ago,

232
00:26:37,255 --> 00:26:39,223
but your subconscious rejected the reality.

233
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,416
- Self-censorship.
-What?

234
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:45,027
It's my Director's opinion.

235
00:26:45,463 --> 00:26:51,629
On H.D.S. your subconscious relaxed
and freed those images.

236
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:55,430
And he tried to kill me.

237
00:26:56,474 --> 00:27:01,377
He read our magazine
and is afraid you'd recognise him.

238
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:06,172
- So he had to kill you.
- It doesn't seem important to you.

239
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:10,486
No, it's not that. I don't believe you.
You made it all up.

240
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:15,188
both the murderer description
and the empty apartment.

241
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:19,290
Do you want to pay me back
for my H.D.S. trick?

242
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:20,390
Me?

243
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,495
But my Director believes you.

244
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:26,834
Come to the office for an exclusive.

245
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:29,435
What does 'exclusive' mean?

246
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:32,840
That you won't mention it
to the rest of the press.

247
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,044
- And if he really kills me?
-What a scoop for my magazine!

248
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:38,749
How lovely...

249
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:42,449
-What'd you like?
- A Fernet for me, please.

250
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:43,749
And for you Valentina?

251
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:53,859
- He's leaving, Gio!
-Who?

252
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,859
-The murderer. We can't let him get away.
- He's leaving...

253
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,602
-You mustn't! You're in danger! That drug..
-What?

254
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,200
What do you want? Leave her alone.

255
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:30,599
There he is!

256
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,619
Over there! Let's go!

257
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,759
Excuse-me.
Did you see a man with black sunglasses?

258
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,866
- I saw nothing.
-What do you mean, nothing?

259
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:13,571
- Nothing, nothing.
-The murderer's in prison, don't worry.

260
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:15,179
In prison?

261
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:20,582
Just take the money
and don't think about anything else.

262
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:30,460
- Good evening, Inspector.
- Good evening, miss. Take a seat.

263
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,557
I didn't think you'd come.

264
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:38,296
You told me someone wanted to kill you...
Just in case...

265
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:42,402
-Your words are discouraging.
- Nobody can discourage you.

266
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:46,499
You and your journalist friend
concocted a story I don't like.

267
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:51,814
- Meaning?
-You take drugs and see a woman being murdered.

268
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,513
Coincidentally,
that woman was a drug dealer.

269
00:29:56,121 --> 00:30:02,424
- Really?
-The murderer had also taken drugs.

270
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:05,928
Just a second!
I don't know anything about all that!

271
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:09,524
You saw it the other day
but it happened six months ago.

272
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:13,529
- You don't believe me?
-What you say can be true or false,

273
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:17,441
I'm curious.
Come on, what else has happened?

274
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,437
This morning I got a note...

275
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:28,652
Oh, handsome journalist!

276
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,449
- Have you seen Valentina?
- Over there.

277
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,055
Bye...

278
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:52,970
- Anyone important tonight?
- No-one goes out these days...

279
00:30:55,713 --> 00:31:01,515
That's everything, and I'm scared.
Inspector, your cigar...

280
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,317
But unfortunately, miss,
the police only believe in facts.

281
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:08,926
- Meaning?
-You told me a lot of facts, too many facts!

282
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,625
Maybe you really took the drug
and it confused you.

283
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:17,023
- Someone tried to kill me!
- But where are the facts?

284
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:21,735
An empty apartment, an appointment,
a door and a murderer

285
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,334
who's been in prison for months
trying to break through it.

286
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,437
I'm sorry, but it's all too absurd.

287
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:31,338
- Anything else you didn't tell me?
-What I think of you...

288
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:36,147
But if tell you, you'd arrest me.
Goodbye, Inspector.

289
00:31:41,092 --> 00:31:42,559
- HiValentina.
- Hi.

290
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,157
The Director loves your story.

291
00:31:45,597 --> 00:31:47,258
Did you know the victim was in the drugs business?

292
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:51,460
- And?
- She did 4 years in prison in Hamburg.

293
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:54,369
The murderer uses drugs
and has been in prison for 6 months.

294
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:57,668
No, not in prison. He's in an asylum.

295
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,708
Anyway, the Director's ready to pay
to have the exclusive.

296
00:32:02,147 --> 00:32:07,813
- At least someone believes me!
- No, he's just a journalist.

297
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:13,122
- And how much would he pay?
- At least 400 grand.

298
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:15,923
I'm in!

299
00:32:34,546 --> 00:32:37,538
- Hi.
- Give them to me, they're quite heavy.

300
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:41,145
- Consumerism! Now they're using...
-Valentina?

301
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,315
-You're the photographic model, aren't you?
- Yes, why?

302
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,528
I'm sorry, but I read your article
and I must talk to you.

303
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:59,831
- OK, let's go up.
- No, we won't be overheard in the car.

304
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:04,164
- Overheard by who?
- It's really important. Please...

305
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:05,873
Alright.

306
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:25,285
Miss!
She must be mad...

307
00:33:27,131 --> 00:33:28,098
Look at these photos.

308
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,997
Well?

309
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:39,007
- Don't you recognise her?
- No. Who is she?

310
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:42,709
Héléne, my sister.
The woman you saw being murdered.

311
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,206
- No, this isn't her.
-What do you mean?

312
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,015
- She was different, a brunette.
- It can't be, you're wrong.

313
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:52,321
I'm not!
This isn't the woman I saw being killed.

314
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:58,319
You could be mistaken,
it happened 6 months ago...

315
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:04,859
- I'll never forget that poor girl's face.
- And the murderer?

316
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:09,364
Listen, I took a drug
and I saw what I saw.

317
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:11,672
But I saw the murderer in person
afterwards.

318
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:15,010
I won't forget his face,
not even in a thousand years.

319
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:18,006
- In ten minutes.
-What?

320
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,510
-You'll see him in 1 0 minutes.
-Where are you taking me?

321
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:27,022
-To the asylum.
-Where?

322
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,722
It's easy to pass people off as mad.

323
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:32,527
He was still there close to Héléne
when they arrested him.

324
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:34,522
He was drugged to the eyeballs.

325
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:41,333
Why killing a girl he didn't know?
And why like that?

326
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:45,732
-Why would I know?
- She was beautiful, full of life...

327
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:52,741
- I don't feel like going there.
- Beautiful, but unlucky.

328
00:34:53,184 --> 00:34:59,953
- I want to go back.
- Just check he's the real murderer.

329
00:35:00,325 --> 00:35:01,087
You're crazy.

330
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:09,188
- A word of advice: don't say that again.
- Okay, okay...

331
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,030
Here we are.

332
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,034
Is it really necessary?

333
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:02,085
- Anyway, I'm Verushka Wuttenberg.
- Nice to meet you.

334
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,787
This way.

335
00:36:19,904 --> 00:36:22,702
- Excuse me, we're in a hurry.
-This way, please.

336
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:27,109
Giacomino, if you tire yourself out,
no syrup tonight.

337
00:36:27,845 --> 00:36:34,216
They're like children, very calm.
Be quiet, Giacomino.

338
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:40,215
Sometimes they get a bit nervous,
they sense the weather!

339
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:57,234
There, that's Nicola Ravelli.
He's always alone.

340
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:00,040
Valentina, go and see if it's him.
I'll wait here.

341
00:37:02,113 --> 00:37:03,171
Please.

342
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:13,081
Poor thing. He's like a child.
Drugs have dulled him.

343
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:20,293
He killed a woman.
She must have been bad, he's so good.

344
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:26,793
He's always in front of the TV.
Were you looking for him?

345
00:37:37,815 --> 00:37:41,012
-Where is the other lady?
- I don't know. Excuse me.

346
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:48,415
Alright, Nicola, it's alright.
People are crazy, you know...

347
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:05,065
- Gorgeous woman!
- Leave me alone!

348
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:09,980
- Let me go!

349
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:15,677
Stop it, you fool!

350
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:19,280
Take him away.

351
00:38:28,032 --> 00:38:29,693
- Stop it!
-Yes Sir.

352
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:41,911
Forgive them, they're just unfortunates.
May I help you?

353
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:47,043
- I just want to get out of here.
- That way.

354
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:56,752
Go first.

355
00:38:58,996 --> 00:39:00,691
It's quicker that way.

356
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:04,599
- Alright, thank you. Good afternoon.
- Goodbye, madam.

357
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,330
Watch out!

358
00:39:34,065 --> 00:39:38,934
- Sorry. May I make it up to you?
-You almost ran me over!

359
00:39:39,604 --> 00:39:41,834
- Anyway, where are you going?
- Me? Milan.

360
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:45,242
-Will you give me a lift?
- Sure. Climb in, come on.

361
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:59,452
-Where in Milan?
-You can leave me at a taxi rank.

362
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:20,276
You look like an actress, lovely.
Something in you moves me.

363
00:40:23,614 --> 00:40:25,275
- A drink?
- No, thanks.

364
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,983
See how organised I am, miss?
Everything I need's here!

365
00:40:37,328 --> 00:40:41,287
Look at that, darling: a hearse.
Seems they bring good luck.

366
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:50,599
''For you, Dolores"".

367
00:41:02,987 --> 00:41:05,683
- Speed up!
- At your command, my lovely.

368
00:41:13,798 --> 00:41:18,167
- Quicker!
- Relax, they call me Jackie Stewart!

369
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:40,584
-What's that?
- Either you let me have some, or you get out.

370
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:45,794
-What?
- Either you let me have it, or you get out.

371
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:51,190
- I'll get out, then!
-You want to get out! Get out, then.

372
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:58,302
-Then get out... This way, miss, in here.
- Idiot!

373
00:41:58,943 --> 00:42:00,740
On there.
- Leave me alone!

374
00:42:01,178 --> 00:42:04,238
- See how organised I am?
- Ignorant! Rogue!

375
00:42:07,184 --> 00:42:09,243
- My balls!Where do you go?
- I told you to leave me alone!

376
00:42:10,788 --> 00:42:13,848
Wow! No... fucking hell!

377
00:42:16,794 --> 00:42:17,761
Stop, stop!

378
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:33,067
- Good afternoon. Something wrong?
- I was in that van...

379
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:38,574
We overtook a hearse
and behind a man wanted to kill me.

380
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:42,777
He's following me!
He's already tried to kill me once!

381
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,983
-With the car?
- Did he try to run you over?

382
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:47,390
- No, with an iron glove.
- See?

383
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,992
I'm not crazy.
Do you know Inspector Seripa?

384
00:42:51,428 --> 00:42:53,487
-Why?
- Call him, he knows all about it.

385
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:54,989
There's the hearse.

386
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:05,034
Well, well: the Gestapo.
Alright, alright...

387
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:10,976
They even break the balls to the dead...

388
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:12,982
Documents, please.

389
00:43:18,722 --> 00:43:21,782
Here's everything, death certificate too.

390
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:24,490
-What's up? Was I speeding?
- Don't be cheeky.

391
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:28,092
- Dolores Jachia.
-The one who jumped under a train.

392
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:30,500
Was there a man behind you in a car?

393
00:43:30,935 --> 00:43:35,804
- I can't see with the flowers.
- He had big black glasses.

394
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:41,204
- Alright, you can go.
-You should come with us.

395
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:43,408
-Where are you taking me?
- To your Inspector friend.

396
00:43:43,848 --> 00:43:46,612
Why did you listen to that grave-digger
and not to me?

397
00:43:47,351 --> 00:43:52,311
Really? The same man with the same face?
Are you sure?

398
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:56,618
- Yes, yes...
- Alright. Look.

399
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,355
Here's the victim, Héléne Grugel, German,

400
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:04,256
dancer, singer, stripper
and more besides.

401
00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:06,770
Is this the woman you saw being killed?

402
00:44:08,205 --> 00:44:13,575
- No.
-What a pity. She'd been arrested for drugs.

403
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:14,775
Well then...

404
00:44:15,312 --> 00:44:20,079
Nicola Radelli,
ex-jazz saxophonist, drug-addict,

405
00:44:20,517 --> 00:44:22,485
found in a state of shock next to the victim.

406
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,084
- Is he the murderer?
No, he's not the one I saw.

407
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:30,788
You're not even warm
on either the victim or the murderer.

408
00:44:31,328 --> 00:44:35,594
That's her!That's her!
The woman I saw murdered!

409
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:39,698
You sure? This woman here?

410
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:45,905
She threw herself under a train.
Dolores Jachia.

411
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:53,515
The one in the hearse.
The man who killed her was behind!

412
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:59,912
Railway Police confirmed
she put her head on the rails!

413
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:04,457
If your boyfriend makes you lie
just to sell copies,

414
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,159
I'll arrest both of you
for inventing a crime.

415
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:10,057
If you want to arrest me,
then arrest me,

416
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:15,265
but this woman was murdered
and I saw the murderer...

417
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:21,042
He wants to kill me! Not interested?
Then sorry, Inspector!

418
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:25,280
You tell me you saw a murder
committed 6 months earlier.

419
00:45:25,716 --> 00:45:30,278
You don't recognise the victim or the murder.
It's not enough.

420
00:45:30,721 --> 00:45:33,383
Fine! We'll just wait
for him to kill me, then!

421
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,722
Ah! Little bitch!

422
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:38,727
Hey!
Watch your language!

423
00:45:38,796 --> 00:45:39,694
Excuse me...

424
00:45:39,964 --> 00:45:42,364
That personal file I asked you
to get on that girl, where is it?

425
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:43,898
On your desk, for hours!

426
00:45:49,573 --> 00:45:53,339
She's from London, lives alone and
has relations with the magazine writer....

427
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:56,075
Look, man, you mustn't
touch him or anything...

428
00:45:56,113 --> 00:45:57,171
I want you to be
in the open...

429
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:10,994
Order me another whisky.

430
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:17,694
-Why not?
-You've already sunk seven. Enough.

431
00:46:20,537 --> 00:46:22,801
Let's dance wickedly close to each other!

432
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,901
- I'm thirsty...
-What do you want?

433
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:35,210
-Yes, miss?
- Don't listen to him. A J&B, please.

434
00:46:36,153 --> 00:46:39,122
-With lots of ice, she's really gone.
- I'll take care of it.

435
00:46:47,664 --> 00:46:50,326
-Thanks, Sergio.
- Don't mention it, miss.

436
00:47:43,153 --> 00:47:45,815
-Why do you keep following me?
- Look.

437
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:52,220
Look at this.The man in the asylum.
He didn't kill Héléne.

438
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:57,623
I know because we're friends.
We played in the same band.

439
00:47:58,168 --> 00:48:02,468
-Why don't you go to the police, then?
-You're in danger.

440
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:08,667
- Me?
-Yes, you.We're all in danger.

441
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:11,372
No-one knows, no-one realizes.
Be careful!

442
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:30,596
Everyone to my place!
Come on, you naughty kids, let's go.

443
00:48:32,336 --> 00:48:34,099
- Miss, come on, let's go.
-We're all in danger...

444
00:48:34,538 --> 00:48:38,304
Yes, we're all survivors.
You too, blondie, let's go.

445
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:51,820
I feel a bit strange tonight.
I feel something inside me.

446
00:48:52,256 --> 00:48:54,622
I fancy women tonight.
I'll go to the doctor tomorrow.

447
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:00,052
- Have this, dear, you'll get over it.
- I'm better already.

448
00:49:00,497 --> 00:49:01,464
Take this, my love...

449
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:08,268
-Want a toke?
- No thanks. I don't smoke that stuff.

450
00:49:08,705 --> 00:49:11,037
You're the most famous drug-user
in Italy!

451
00:49:11,608 --> 00:49:17,069
-Who is this shit-head?
- Shut up! It's my favourite model.

452
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:23,381
Who's that touching me?
You never leave me in peace!

453
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:27,184
- It wasn't me.
-You bore. Say you like me...

454
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:02,421
-What are you doing?
- If they catch me here I'll go to jail.

455
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:06,317
- Oh, no, treasure, stay.
- Let her go. One tart less...

456
00:50:07,064 --> 00:50:10,727
You're vulgar.
Oh, the wig.Valentina, your hair!

457
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:34,550
-Who is it?
-Valentina.

458
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:56,372
- Hi Stefano.
- Come in!

459
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:02,035
If you come here,
it means that something happened. Hi.

460
00:52:04,014 --> 00:52:05,140
- I saw him again.
-Who?

461
00:52:05,782 --> 00:52:10,151
The murderer was waiting for me in the dark.
Thanks mirror...

462
00:52:10,787 --> 00:52:15,053
- Oh, of course... the mirror!
-Why don't you ever believe me?

463
00:52:16,193 --> 00:52:19,162
-What's up?
- Come with me, I'll show you something.

464
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:37,874
-Who're they?
-The children ofToshiro, a Japanese friend.

465
00:52:38,315 --> 00:52:40,078
He had to go to Geneva for an exhibition.

466
00:52:45,822 --> 00:52:50,589
- And you, when will you have a kid?
-With all my problems...

467
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:56,490
Maybe in ten years
I'll have some company.

468
00:52:57,434 --> 00:53:01,427
Did you hear what I said?
The murderer's on my back again!

469
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:10,037
Tomorrow... You're here
because you can't do without me.

470
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:13,149
Come on little girl, let's go to bed.

471
00:53:15,185 --> 00:53:17,949
Who said you've got to wait ten years?

472
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:24,054
You'd be sure with me.
I like kids and I'd look after them.

473
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,964
If you had a kid
you'd not waste your life like this.

474
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:39,471
You wouldn't do so many stupid,
useless things.

475
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:43,374
What are you doing? Crying?

476
00:53:45,615 --> 00:53:53,283
-What should I do?
- Nothing. Let's just make love...

477
00:53:56,226 --> 00:53:57,386
You'll forget about it...

478
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:10,933
There, it's ready.

479
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:15,736
Come on kids, come to breakfast.

480
00:54:18,582 --> 00:54:21,050
- Here, take the apple.
- Sit down.

481
00:54:22,486 --> 00:54:23,748
Good work, little housewife...

482
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:28,553
Don't you eat? Your egg...

483
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:39,366
-What's your name?
-Valentina, and yours?

484
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:42,871
Did you sleep with Uncle Stefano
last night?

485
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:48,867
She did. I saw them.
They were in bed together.

486
00:54:57,621 --> 00:55:01,614
Gosh, it's late!
I've got the exhibition opening today!

487
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:10,928
I'd better not go.
In Italy I feel... I'm in my underwear.

488
00:55:11,568 --> 00:55:15,334
No, let's go.
I feel today you'll sell everything.

489
00:55:15,872 --> 00:55:19,137
- Alright.
- I must change my cloths before.

490
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:45,964
Let's hope for the best!

491
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:47,165
Look at this.What's his name?

492
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:53,376
- It looks like a slice of gruyere.
-You're old-fashioned!

493
00:55:56,746 --> 00:55:58,077
- Hi.
- Hi.

494
00:55:58,548 --> 00:56:00,948
- Don't tell me you've sold everything?!
-Those two.

495
00:56:01,585 --> 00:56:04,247
- Really? Who to?
-Two Swiss people.

496
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:08,153
- Incredible! Oh, this is Valentina.
- Nice to meet you.

497
00:56:08,592 --> 00:56:12,551
-You too.
- Another surprise: a commission.

498
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:19,260
- A funerary monument?
-What's wrong?

499
00:56:20,203 --> 00:56:22,364
It's strange they chose me.
I've never done one.

500
00:56:23,206 --> 00:56:26,175
Anyway, they left a nice advance, look.

501
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:32,170
The survey's for today
and an estimate for tomorrow.

502
00:56:32,716 --> 00:56:39,087
-What survey?
- At least take a look at the other graves.

503
00:56:39,723 --> 00:56:44,092
- I'm busy, and then go to a cemetery...
- I'll go!

504
00:56:44,928 --> 00:56:48,989
Great.
Take some photos of the graves nearby.

505
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:54,502
-You'll take measurements too?
- Right, but I want a fee!

506
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:00,235
- Always hunting for money?
- For you I'll do it for free...

507
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:05,612
Let's get a move on,
I don't like this place.

508
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:09,643
- 1.5 by 2.4.Write it down, Pino.
- 1 .5 by 2.4.

509
00:57:10,086 --> 00:57:12,247
Now put the notebook away
and take the photos.

510
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:18,056
So, photograph that one,
those two there, and this one.

511
00:57:18,495 --> 00:57:20,656
- Okay.
- Come on. Make them focussed.

512
00:57:21,297 --> 00:57:22,662
- Have you got enough film?

513
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,365
- You're such an idiot!
- How sensitive you are...

514
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:30,564
You get everything wrong.

515
00:57:40,517 --> 00:57:44,578
-What are you doing here?
- I'm here for my poor sister.

516
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:49,285
You! If it were for you
I'd still be in that asylum!

517
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:52,886
I'm sorry. I couldn't let him find me in there.

518
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:56,992
He doesn't want me to do that.
He hated Héléne.

519
00:57:57,434 --> 00:58:01,302
- He, who?
- Otto, my husband... Professor Wuttenberg.

520
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,806
I'm finished. I'll be outside.
Your bag's near the grave.

521
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:09,407
Alright.

522
00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:14,714
What does your husband got to do
with your sister?

523
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:17,310
If he knew I've come here...

524
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:22,819
He's a very influential man,
he'd soon lock me away.

525
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:29,930
He's warned me...
He doesn't want me to think about her.

526
00:58:30,366 --> 00:58:33,733
But I know the man we saw
in the asylum didn't kill her.

527
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:37,833
Drugs make you unhappy,
but don't make you do this stuff.

528
00:58:38,274 --> 00:58:40,936
At most they make you empty, harmless.

529
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:45,344
Who killed her and hides himself
knows about me and you,

530
00:58:46,683 --> 00:58:49,846
he's afraid, scared.

531
00:58:50,286 --> 00:58:52,447
- He's capable of anything.
-Who're you talking about?

532
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:54,948
About the man who killed Héléne.

533
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:09,703
Valentina, come over here.

534
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:20,107
He's here, did you see, he's here!
He wants to kill us!

535
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,610
Calm down. Maybe it was an accident.

536
00:59:25,155 --> 00:59:28,921
Get out of here. Come on, let's go.
Oh, I forgot my bag.

537
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,827
- I'll go and wait for you outside.
- Alright.

538
00:59:55,185 --> 00:59:56,948
-Where is she?
-Who?

539
00:59:57,387 --> 01:00:03,257
Verushka. She was with you just now.
She's very ill.

540
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:09,656
-Why are you telling me?
- Because you mustn't believe her.

541
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,560
I know nothing.

542
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:15,671
- Let me go!
- Didn't she tell you about Hamburg?

543
01:00:17,207 --> 01:00:21,667
Last time too you got in trouble
and you couldn't get out.

544
01:00:22,645 --> 01:00:27,605
So, once again,
the exit's that way.

545
01:00:55,879 --> 01:00:59,144
-Your man left. I'll give you a lift.
- No, I'll walk.

546
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:04,178
Don't you want to know the truth?
Only I can help you.

547
01:01:05,021 --> 01:01:08,582
- Come on, get in.
- Oh, alright.

548
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:29,710
-What did he ask you?
- If you had talked about Hamburg.

549
01:01:30,747 --> 01:01:33,113
- Me? Why?
- I don't know.

550
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:37,715
He also said you were very ill.

551
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:42,422
Perhaps... Since they killed my sister.

552
01:01:43,059 --> 01:01:46,517
You didn't know her,
but what they wrote isn't true.

553
01:01:47,463 --> 01:01:51,422
I'm sorry. Anyway, I know the woman
I saw being killed.

554
01:01:51,968 --> 01:01:54,528
Or I think saw,
because it seems she committed suicide.

555
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:58,434
- Her name was Dolores...
- Jachia?

556
01:01:59,075 --> 01:02:00,167
Yes, do you know her?

557
01:02:02,211 --> 01:02:04,975
- Someone's following us.
- Are you sure?

558
01:02:05,415 --> 01:02:07,883
- Yes.
- Slow down a bit.

559
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:27,896
My nerves are shot,
I see danger everywhere.

560
01:02:29,138 --> 01:02:33,837
-Where are we going?
-To the villa of Dolores Jachia.

561
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:37,078
I knew her, she was a friend of Héléne's.

562
01:02:37,814 --> 01:02:40,874
Something must have happened,
but I'd left Hamburg by then.

563
01:02:41,517 --> 01:02:43,883
- Understood?
- Not really...

564
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,589
You saw who killed Dolores,
the man who killed Héléne too.

565
01:02:51,127 --> 01:02:57,396
-What have I got to do with it?
- Only you saw the murderer.

566
01:02:57,834 --> 01:03:02,134
- So?
- I've got to use you to get to the murderer.

567
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:07,532
- Use me? How?
- Just trust me.

568
01:03:08,578 --> 01:03:13,038
Trust you?!
After the cemetery, the asylum...

569
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:15,551
I should trust you now?

570
01:03:16,085 --> 01:03:21,352
It'll only take a few minutes. Please!

571
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:10,935
Just a bit longer,
then I won't bother you anymore.

572
01:04:11,374 --> 01:04:14,241
- It's important for both of us.
- Let's hope so...

573
01:04:28,191 --> 01:04:28,748
But...

574
01:04:31,794 --> 01:04:37,460
You again.What are you doing here?
What do you want?

575
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:48,568
What did you do to that cat?
Poor animal...

576
01:04:49,412 --> 01:04:55,976
No, it wasn't me.
It was him, the other man...

577
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,512
- The cat scratched him.
- Slitting its throat like that...

578
01:05:00,957 --> 01:05:04,120
Verusha, come here!

579
01:05:04,861 --> 01:05:08,627
-What happens?
- I knew you'd get me in trouble again!

580
01:05:09,098 --> 01:05:12,431
-What?
-There was a man. I meet him everywhere.

581
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:17,938
Oh, Pepito, Dolores' handyman.
Odd, but not dangerous.

582
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:22,435
- He had a dead cat, it was horrible.
- A dead cat?

583
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,676
Alright, calm down now. Let's go inside.

584
01:05:46,035 --> 01:05:51,803
- You saw her being killed?
-Yes. But why are we here?

585
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:54,004
I want to show you something.

586
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,250
Come here, please.

587
01:06:14,897 --> 01:06:21,962
We're all in here:
family, friends, wives, husbands, lovers.

588
01:06:23,005 --> 01:06:29,171
The murderer's in here too.
Look hard at these faces.

589
01:06:33,516 --> 01:06:35,984
This is Héléne.

590
01:06:40,623 --> 01:06:43,888
- It's him!This one here!
- HenriVelaq, her manager.

591
01:06:44,727 --> 01:06:48,686
- Impossible, they liked each other.
- I swear it's him!

592
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:53,192
- No...
-Yes, Verushka...That's the way it is.

593
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:59,301
- Henri!
- I killed Dolores.

594
01:06:59,742 --> 01:07:03,940
-You? Why?
-To get revenge for your sister.

595
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:08,248
- Now I've got to kill you two as well.
-You're crazy!

596
01:07:08,684 --> 01:07:14,350
She saw me kill Dolores, you know it!
I must kill you both.

597
01:07:28,604 --> 01:07:30,663
Be careful, she's going!

598
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:59,046
Border posts are under control,
they can't get through.

599
01:09:59,755 --> 01:10:04,124
Airports, no chance, they can be excluded.
Trains neither.

600
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:10,630
Four countries inspect,
but drugs still arrive to Milan.

601
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:16,026
They both arrive and leave
right under your nose, Seripa!

602
01:10:16,572 --> 01:10:20,531
- Under yours and everybody's.
- Don't we have a Drugs Squad?

603
01:10:20,976 --> 01:10:29,441
Yes.They've arrested a hippy,
the Police Chief's son!

604
01:10:29,985 --> 01:10:34,445
You're my assistant
and you must check everything!

605
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:36,453
Answer it!

606
01:10:38,494 --> 01:10:42,055
Yes? Who's it? What?

607
01:10:42,598 --> 01:10:46,364
- It's all true, I didn't make it up!
Sure, sure...

608
01:10:46,802 --> 01:10:49,464
She was here in the car
with a knife in her breast.

609
01:10:49,939 --> 01:10:55,775
She got tired of waiting,
took the knife out and left.

610
01:10:56,212 --> 01:10:59,181
I told you the truth!

611
01:10:59,715 --> 01:11:06,917
Yes...The car, the knife,
the half-wit and the dead cat...

612
01:11:07,356 --> 01:11:12,623
-Tell me the truth.
- Inspector, some tire tracks!

613
01:11:13,462 --> 01:11:18,126
There! See?
These are the tracks left by her car!

614
01:11:19,068 --> 01:11:23,232
- Convinced now?
-Yes... There was a car...

615
01:11:24,273 --> 01:11:25,638
In the last few days...

616
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:34,345
-What's your friend's name?
-Verushka. See her 'V'?

617
01:11:35,384 --> 01:11:36,851
-Yes. And what's your name?
-Valentina.

618
01:11:37,253 --> 01:11:39,346
Exactly.
What's the first letter of Valentina?

619
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:50,054
Well, Gio Baldi...
Your boyfriend and his your phone number.

620
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:57,862
I'm not as stupid as you think,
I can recognise a stunt.

621
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:01,906
-What haven't you told me?
- Nothing!

622
01:12:02,645 --> 01:12:05,910
Don't shout! Your voice's horrible!
I told you everything...

623
01:12:09,351 --> 01:12:10,613
The photo...

624
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:15,112
-What?
-There's a photo of the murderer, Henri...

625
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:18,823
- I don't remember.
- He's named Henri... That's everything!

626
01:12:19,261 --> 01:12:22,128
He was the manager of Héléne
and he killed Dolores.

627
01:12:22,565 --> 01:12:25,932
- He killed a woman who committed suicide?
- He confessed it!

628
01:12:26,368 --> 01:12:30,737
Alright. Let's take a look.
Gianantonio, the cars!

629
01:12:31,774 --> 01:12:33,435
Come with me, I'll show you.

630
01:12:38,781 --> 01:12:41,648
Where is it?
Ah, here it is.

631
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:44,948
So...

632
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:53,686
But... It's gone...

633
01:12:56,532 --> 01:13:01,333
It was here, I promise you!
He was with Héléne.

634
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:04,539
- Really?
-You don't believe me, do you?

635
01:13:04,974 --> 01:13:08,535
-You see the page is empty.
-Yes, I see the page is empty.

636
01:13:08,978 --> 01:13:19,149
-Why would I have invented it?
-You or your friend must tell me.

637
01:13:20,089 --> 01:13:25,857
- You won't give up...
- If you don't talk, there'll be trouble!

638
01:13:26,295 --> 01:13:28,263
The hell with you!

639
01:13:34,103 --> 01:13:37,072
- You come with us.
- Are you arresting me?

640
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:39,770
I don't know.
At least you'll sign a statement.

641
01:13:40,209 --> 01:13:41,870
- Close up and come to headquarters.
- Fine, sir.

642
01:13:42,311 --> 01:13:43,175
Don't waste time!

643
01:13:48,217 --> 01:13:49,479
Sergeant, don't drive too fast.

644
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:20,939
-Wait for me here.
- Alright.

645
01:14:23,686 --> 01:14:25,051
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

646
01:14:26,088 --> 01:14:29,057
-Where's Stefano?
- I don't know. He left, he was nervous.

647
01:14:29,491 --> 01:14:35,054
-Why?
-The exhibition didn't go very well...

648
01:14:35,497 --> 01:14:42,164
-Where can he be?
- Getting drunk. He tried hard to find you!

649
01:14:42,705 --> 01:14:46,368
- Okay, thanks. Bye.
- Bye. Oh, photos and measurements?

650
01:14:46,809 --> 01:14:47,776
I'll send them tomorrow.

651
01:14:52,214 --> 01:14:59,177
- So that means she's mad.
- No, she's just a bit strange.

652
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:07,027
When she left she was wearing
a blue suit, sleeveless...

653
01:15:11,467 --> 01:15:14,834
- Any news?
- No, sir. Just the usual routine.

654
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,636
- Did anyone ask for me?
-Yes, Sergeant Quagliarulo.

655
01:15:18,073 --> 01:15:23,340
- And we couldn't find Gio Baldi.
I'll deal with it.

656
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:29,139
- Suede handbag...
- Shoulder bag.

657
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:33,646
Yes, sir. Suede shoulder handbag.

658
01:15:34,523 --> 01:15:39,051
- Ouagliarulo!Where's Gio Baldi?
- He's vanished, sir.

659
01:15:39,495 --> 01:15:43,659
What? We're the police!
I want him here right now!

660
01:15:45,601 --> 01:15:52,370
The undersigned declares
that his wife's been missing

661
01:15:52,808 --> 01:15:57,177
since yesterday, the day before today"".
Is that right?

662
01:15:57,713 --> 01:16:01,615
- Professor, is that right?
- Yes.

663
01:16:02,551 --> 01:16:07,921
- Is Inspector Seripa in?
- Go in, they're looking for you.

664
01:16:08,657 --> 01:16:12,423
- Professor, will you sign, please?
- Certainly.

665
01:16:15,664 --> 01:16:19,930
- Come in.
- Hello, Inspector, how's it going?

666
01:16:20,702 --> 01:16:26,937
- Sit down. I was looking for you.
- Yes, I know, here I am.

667
01:16:27,509 --> 01:16:32,378
- So, what have you got to say?
-What do you mean?

668
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:44,688
- Nasko, where's Uncle Stefano?
- He didn't come home.

669
01:16:45,327 --> 01:16:48,194
-We're leaving tomorrow.
-Where are you going?

670
01:16:48,931 --> 01:16:54,801
-To Switzerland, to daddy.
- Come on, go to bed.

671
01:16:57,139 --> 01:17:02,042
-Your card was outside the villa.
- So?

672
01:17:02,477 --> 01:17:03,944
Why was it there?

673
01:17:04,379 --> 01:17:08,042
I'm a journalist.
Everybody's got my card.

674
01:17:08,483 --> 01:17:11,646
Bullshit! Your girlfriend's
phone number's written on it.

675
01:17:12,087 --> 01:17:14,453
What's this interrogation about?
What happened?

676
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:18,949
What did you do in Hamburg
for 2 months 3 years ago?

677
01:17:19,795 --> 01:17:25,062
Hamburg, New York, Rio de Janeiro...
I'm a journalist!

678
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,960
- How can I remember?
-Think about it.Take your time.

679
01:17:31,607 --> 01:17:32,972
We've got all night.

680
01:17:43,051 --> 01:17:46,612
-You're here at last.
- Can't you just shut up?

681
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:56,228
- I'm exhausted...
-You talk, you don't...no difference.

682
01:17:57,165 --> 01:17:59,531
What are you on about? Come here.

683
01:18:01,003 --> 01:18:04,666
Why have you been drinking again?
That's my business...

684
01:18:05,107 --> 01:18:08,474
-What're you saying?
-You're just like all the others.

685
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:14,281
-You've not even the guts to be a whore...
- Are you crazy?

686
01:18:15,017 --> 01:18:22,981
All day I've looked for you!
How stupid I am!

687
01:18:23,425 --> 01:18:30,593
I was alone!Who're you with?

688
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:34,594
- Get out!
-You coward! I won't come here ever again,

689
01:18:35,037 --> 01:18:37,904
you'll have to crawl
and beg my forgiveness!

690
01:19:08,103 --> 01:19:13,871
Hernandez, 29, Puerto Rican
and Krutzer, 32, from Hamburg.

691
01:19:14,309 --> 01:19:20,373
- Never heard about.
-Well-known by Drugs Squads everywhere.

692
01:19:20,816 --> 01:19:24,684
-What's it to me? It's Sunday.
- And for me too.

693
01:19:25,187 --> 01:19:27,485
They've been in Milan for ten days

694
01:19:27,923 --> 01:19:31,484
they're part of a big drug
dealing organisation.

695
01:19:32,627 --> 01:19:37,587
Hello. Are you sure? Okay.

696
01:19:38,734 --> 01:19:39,792
That was the lab.

697
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:45,172
Dolores Jachia was already dead
when she committed suicide.

698
01:19:45,607 --> 01:19:46,574
Murder?

699
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:53,570
Spadea! Maybe that mad girl was right...

700
01:19:53,915 --> 01:19:56,475
-Which girl?
-Yes, sir?

701
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:02,284
- Have you called Valentina?
- Four times, but no answers.

702
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:05,392
- Keep trying, Spadea.
- Alright.

703
01:20:06,028 --> 01:20:08,292
-You'll tell me about the girl later.
- Of course.

704
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:13,099
Those two worked in France,
Hamburg, Istanbul and Karachi

705
01:20:13,535 --> 01:20:18,302
Disappeared 6 months ago,
photographed at Linate Airport.

706
01:20:29,351 --> 01:20:32,115
Hello? ...Hello?

707
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,827
Sir, I tried again. No answer.
Shall I send someone?

708
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:45,027
- No, no. You can go... Bloody hell!
- Fine, sir.

709
01:20:51,506 --> 01:20:54,669
Yes? Who did you expect then?

710
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:59,168
What? Alright, I'll be right there.

711
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:18,428
Shut up!

712
01:21:24,473 --> 01:21:25,633
Could you give me a light?

713
01:21:29,377 --> 01:21:30,036
Thanks.

714
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:35,049
Let's go.

715
01:21:41,089 --> 01:21:42,056
- A J&B.
-With ice?

716
01:21:42,491 --> 01:21:43,150
Yes, a double.

717
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:52,860
He was already dead.
It's obvious he killed himself.

718
01:21:55,704 --> 01:21:58,070
Really? Can't you see he was murdered?

719
01:21:58,607 --> 01:22:00,507
Look at the hole: clean,

720
01:22:01,143 --> 01:22:06,206
no burn marks.We've arrived too late.
We can go.

721
01:22:40,182 --> 01:22:42,946
- Flying Squad.
- Is Inspector Seripa there?

722
01:22:43,385 --> 01:22:46,445
- No, miss, he's not here.
-When will he be back?

723
01:22:47,389 --> 01:22:51,450
-Who knows? It's Sunday.
- Right, thank you.

724
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:53,060
Goodbye.

725
01:22:54,196 --> 01:22:58,360
Do you need the Inspector in person?
Can't you talk to me?

726
01:23:00,135 --> 01:23:02,296
- No.
- Fine. You can sit down.

727
01:23:42,277 --> 01:23:45,041
- Hello?
- How are you? Did I wake you?

728
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,639
-Where are you?
- I'm having an aperitif.

729
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:51,951
-The killer's in the flat opposite here.
-What?

730
01:23:52,387 --> 01:23:56,255
- I'm scared.When will you get here?
- One minute. I'm here.

731
01:23:57,092 --> 01:24:00,789
- I'll be right down.
- Have you called the police?

732
01:24:01,229 --> 01:24:05,893
-Yes, but Seripa wasn't in.
- Fine. I'll come and meet you.

733
01:24:14,843 --> 01:24:18,301
- Good, let's go.
- I don't want to come, I'm scared.

734
01:24:18,747 --> 01:24:21,614
Why? You're with me!
Come on, let's go.

735
01:24:35,964 --> 01:24:39,127
Here's the key,
but I'm doing something improper.

736
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:43,632
Just two minutes please.

737
01:24:45,173 --> 01:24:46,333
Thanks.

738
01:24:58,186 --> 01:25:00,484
-Where was he?
-There, on the terrace.

739
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:04,887
- Let's have a look.
- No! I'm sorry, I'm scared.

740
01:25:06,127 --> 01:25:06,889
Fine.

741
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:42,922
There's no-one here.
It's time to tell me everything.

742
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:45,128
I swear they were there on the terrace!

743
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,691
Stop this farce.
I've also been to the Police.

744
01:25:48,136 --> 01:25:51,697
What's that? Verushka, Dolores, Héléne:
all women, dead.

745
01:25:53,241 --> 01:25:56,608
Who was Héléne looking for in Milan?
Who else's in the gang?

746
01:25:57,445 --> 01:26:01,142
What gang?
Gio, you don't believe me...

747
01:26:01,583 --> 01:26:05,952
No! Tell me. How I can I help you
if you don't tell me?

748
01:26:06,388 --> 01:26:08,652
- Idiot!
- Alright, I'll tell you everything...

749
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:12,059
You're a bastard!

750
01:26:13,895 --> 01:26:15,954
If I'm not mistaken, we can leave.

751
01:26:16,398 --> 01:26:18,161
- Got a light?
- I don't smoke.

752
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:48,795
Give me a light, and another whisky.

753
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:50,197
- Double?
- No, triple.

754
01:26:56,237 --> 01:26:57,602
- Miss?
-Yes?

755
01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:00,733
- I couldn't get the milk.
- It doesn't matter, thanks.

756
01:27:01,176 --> 01:27:02,541
- I'll get some as I finish here.
- Fine.

757
01:27:31,906 --> 01:27:35,865
Miss, I get you skimmed?
I'll bring it in 1 0 minutes.

758
01:27:57,432 --> 01:27:58,797
Fingerprints...

759
01:28:17,085 --> 01:28:20,350
Give me the knife.
It's got to look as if they fought hard.

760
01:28:28,496 --> 01:28:30,862
Catch her! Where're you going?

761
01:29:02,564 --> 01:29:09,128
Open your mouth! That's better!
Move on!

762
01:29:10,271 --> 01:29:12,239
Be quiet!

763
01:29:15,076 --> 01:29:18,944
And now we'll put some music on!

764
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:11,098
Oh, Stefano, at last!

765
01:30:13,234 --> 01:30:15,099
Why haven't you killed her yet?

766
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:20,207
It was impossible,
the concierge was just outside.

767
01:30:20,642 --> 01:30:22,610
He'll be back with the milk soon.

768
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,112
Bastard!

769
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,715
Behave yourself!

770
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:40,627
As the concierge brings the milk,
you'll hang yourself...

771
01:30:41,596 --> 01:30:43,962
in remorse for having killed that man.

772
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,960
Modesty aside, it was my idea.
Not bad...

773
01:30:49,203 --> 01:30:50,966
Would you prefer him to hang you?

774
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:57,871
Answer me!
Would you prefer to do it yourself?

775
01:30:59,013 --> 01:31:06,419
Your prints on the knife,
this packet of drugs on the bed,

776
01:31:08,856 --> 01:31:10,221
just guess what the police will say...

777
01:31:11,059 --> 01:31:13,926
Poor woman.
What did she have to do with it?

778
01:31:14,462 --> 01:31:18,228
- I don't know.
-Think. You must have an idea.

779
01:31:18,766 --> 01:31:23,100
- She's just a victim of the situation.
-Tell me everything.

780
01:31:23,838 --> 01:31:30,209
I followed them after they killed her
but they vanished.

781
01:31:30,745 --> 01:31:36,911
-Where did you meet Verushka?
- In Hamburg 6 years ago.

782
01:31:37,652 --> 01:31:43,420
Six years ago I lived with a girl
in Hamburg. Don't move!

783
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:46,126
I'll tell you why you're going to die.

784
01:31:47,161 --> 01:31:51,029
That girl was a striptease artist, her name was
Héléne.

785
01:31:51,666 --> 01:32:00,165
Héléne had a friend, Dolores.
She and her partner, Otto,

786
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:02,767
were the bosses of a drug dealing gang.

787
01:32:03,211 --> 01:32:07,978
Dolores and I came to Milan
to set up a new organisation.

788
01:32:08,616 --> 01:32:11,176
Do you want to know
what happened in Via Lanciani?

789
01:32:14,322 --> 01:32:17,189
It's not by chance
that your flat's right opposite it.

790
01:32:17,825 --> 01:32:20,487
It was really useful having the keys to this
apartment

791
01:32:20,928 --> 01:32:24,386
because I could watch
and keep an eye on them both.

792
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:28,495
I didn't mind that
Dolores was in love with Nicola,

793
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:33,103
but my rival
distributed drugs in his own way,

794
01:32:33,541 --> 01:32:36,009
into his own pockets.

795
01:32:36,544 --> 01:32:39,604
Who did I meet one evening
in a Milan bar?

796
01:32:40,047 --> 01:32:42,515
It was her, Héléne! What could I do?

797
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:45,610
She'd have reported me.
I took her to Via Lanciani

798
01:32:46,053 --> 01:32:49,454
and made it look like the crime of a sadist...

799
01:33:00,802 --> 01:33:07,605
The police found Nicola there
and charged him with the crime

800
01:33:08,242 --> 01:33:12,303
Then I made a call...
Being careful to disguise my voice,

801
01:33:12,847 --> 01:33:18,615
I told Héléne's manager
she'd been killed by Dolores,

802
01:33:19,053 --> 01:33:20,520
out of jealousy.

803
01:33:21,656 --> 01:33:25,422
I got what I wanted: he killed Dolores...

804
01:33:25,893 --> 01:33:29,659
Hurry up!Take photos
and do whatever you've got to do.

805
01:33:31,499 --> 01:33:34,059
Hey, sir! Seen this? Look at this...

806
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:41,363
This is where
the 30 kilos of heroin ended up,

807
01:33:41,809 --> 01:33:44,369
- And the drugs travelled around the world.
- Sir!

808
01:33:44,912 --> 01:33:47,472
The sculptor can't be found.
Do I get someone to keep guard?

809
01:33:47,915 --> 01:33:48,882
- Yes.
- Alright.

810
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:53,284
Take him to headquarters.
Let's go to Via Lanciani.

811
01:33:55,022 --> 01:34:02,326
They took care of Otto, Dolores and the one here.

812
01:34:03,364 --> 01:34:04,058
Shut up...

813
01:34:08,002 --> 01:34:08,969
Miss, the milk!

814
01:34:10,104 --> 01:34:12,163
Answer, if you don't want to end up
like Héléne and Dolores!

815
01:34:12,607 --> 01:34:13,665
The milk!

816
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:16,677
Careful... and no tricks!

817
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,579
Leave it outside the door.

818
01:34:24,819 --> 01:34:25,786
Got a light?

819
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,380
I'll get some matches.

820
01:34:49,143 --> 01:34:52,704
Come on, darling,
it'll be over in an instant.

821
01:34:53,147 --> 01:34:57,709
There's only one regret:
I won't make love to you again!

822
01:35:09,096 --> 01:35:09,755
Open the door, Valentina!

823
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,665
Open up!

824
01:35:14,702 --> 01:35:16,363
I'll break the door down!

825
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:23,372
Open up!

826
01:35:25,613 --> 01:35:26,773
It's me! Open up!

827
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:33,077
- Oh, I'm sorry. You're here...
- Can I help you?

828
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:36,089
No, I wanted to talk to Valentina.

829
01:35:36,524 --> 01:35:40,483
I'm sorry, she's taking a bath.
I'll call her if you want.

830
01:35:41,362 --> 01:35:43,796
No, leave her in peace.

831
01:35:46,467 --> 01:35:47,934
- Got a light?
- Yes.

832
01:36:17,631 --> 01:36:20,794
Some advice:
catch me or you'll be in trouble.

833
01:36:23,337 --> 01:36:24,395
Let's go! Hurry up!

834
01:36:47,962 --> 01:36:49,725
-That way!
- Ok!

835
01:37:04,712 --> 01:37:05,269
Stop!

836
01:37:39,146 --> 01:37:40,704
You're always in the way!

837
01:38:04,572 --> 01:38:07,769
- Don't move!
-Wait! Leave it to me!

838
01:38:27,428 --> 01:38:29,089
- Call a squad out! Come with me.
-Yes, sir.

839
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,207
Not laughing anymore?

840
01:38:50,551 --> 01:38:52,815
Stop! That's enough.

841
01:38:54,655 --> 01:38:55,917
You've had your fun.

842
01:39:10,804 --> 01:39:11,566
Idiot!

843
01:41:02,349 --> 01:41:03,611
Sorry, have you got a light?

844
01:41:04,251 --> 01:41:07,084
You smoke too much, young man.
It could do you harm.

845
01:41:08,322 --> 01:41:08,981
Thanks.
