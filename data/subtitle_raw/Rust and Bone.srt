<b><i>RUST AND BONE</i></b>

3
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,750
I'm hungry.

4
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,292
I'm hungry!

5
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,361
Do you want?

6
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,282
Stop!

7
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,971
Stop, I said stop!

8
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,125
Sam!

9
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:28,583
These has better image quality.

10
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,958
These are semi-professional cameras.
I'll show you something.

11
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,751
This is the best quality.

12
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,042
Hey, sir!

13
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,333
Come on,
what are you doing?

14
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,959
- Tired?
- No.

15
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,834
- Are you Ali?
- Yes.

16
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,650
Come on!

17
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,969
You're late!

18
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,884
I drove around for an hour!

19
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,768
Move!

20
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,321
I meant to call Anna,
I couldn't find you.

21
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,501
- Do you like my truck?
- Yes.

22
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,542
- Do you really like?
- Yes.

23
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,458
I don't like those
who dislike my truck!

24
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,649
- So, do you like it?
- Yes.

25
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,292
You're a nice boy.

26
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:48,833
Eight drivers on the road.
After some conversations with Anna ...

27
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,458
I told myself that
I was going on my own.

28
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:54,958
Then I bought this truck.

29
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,331
What's that for?

30
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,727
To eat outside,
when the weather is nice!

31
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,167
There's too much sun here!

32
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,766
I'm still waiting.

33
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,843
Look!

34
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,410
Look!

35
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:20,125
You see the dogs?
Those are Aunt Anna's.

36
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,049
Who owns those car parts?

37
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,964
Neighbor Che's.

38
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,044
He who moonlights with this.

39
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,625
Very handy.

40
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,764
Say when stop.

41
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,050
With this you become a big boy.

42
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,044
How long haven't you seen Anna?

43
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,362
- I don't know, five years.
- Long time!

44
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,042
- Where does she work?
- In a supermarket.

45
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,208
- What? She is a cashier?
- Yeah. Exactly.

46
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,125
No, from the top stack.
Most are expired.

47
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,000
They are arranged by date,
from top to bottom.

48
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,248
- I grab one here?
- Yeah, above.

49
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,686
- Do you want?
- No.

50
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,125
Anna takes them home from work.

51
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,170
As soon as the date has passed,
they are discarded.

52
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,324
They can be eaten
for at least one week.

53
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,249
Do you earn well?

54
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,765
Listen...

55
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,810
What can I say ...
We can pay our bills.

56
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,611
- What exactly do you do?
- Deliveries. Frozen products.

57
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,207
Fish in general,
but I can do other products.

58
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,727
That depends on the offer.

59
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,917
More coffee?

60
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,167
Yeah, it's great!

61
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,042
He looks like you.

62
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,458
Is that all?
You won't give your brother a kiss?

63
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,721
Hum...

64
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,042
Are you okay?

65
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,044
That's all you got?

66
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,567
At least
she left his passport.

67
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,750
She forgot it was there.

68
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:32,974
When they went to Amsterdam,
they used the kid to smuggle dope.

69
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,521
Are you kidding?

70
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,762
That's what she told me.

71
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,410
Well...

72
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,127
How will you take care of him?
Because Richard and I don't have time.

73
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,284
He went to school, at least?

74
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,250
Don't you know if your son
went to school?

75
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,091
Sam! you went to school
at your mom's?

76
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,526
Yes!

77
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,241
I'll try to enroll him at the school.
We also need to get him some clothes.

78
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,246
He can't go like that.
I'll check with the neighbors.

79
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,005
- Shall I wake you in an hour?
- Yes.

80
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,366
I close the door?

81
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,562
- No, it's okay.
- It's okay?

82
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,925
- Can I have a cake?
- Do you want?

83
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,367
- Yes.
- Okay.

84
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,564
- Here, you.

85
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,802
Here! Here!

86
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,203
Here, this one too!

87
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,646
Do you watch them?

88
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,410
Don't hurt them!

89
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,365
- Oops...
- Be careful so they can't run away.

90
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,625
Won't you eat?

91
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,929
- They are beautiful, huh?
- Yeah.

92
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,333
I got them from a breeder.

93
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,333
In a month he takes them
to a shelter.

94
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,375
- Are you okay?
- I'm exhausted, but...

95
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,500
- It doesn't work anymore!
- Wait and you will see!

96
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,887
Looks can be deceiving sometimes.

97
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,849
To go to your work.

98
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,500
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

99
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,888
Che! Che!

100
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,407
- Yes?
- Where is the toolbox?

101
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,568
- In the garage.
- There?

102
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,688
Can you help us?

103
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,683
Stop it, stop it!

104
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,285
Oh!

105
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,681
Will you stop
with this mess?

106
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,750
- When is Mommy coming?
- Soon.

107
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,708
Soon...

108
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,167
- When is Mommy coming?
- Soon, I told you!

109
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,500
- When?
- I don't know.

110
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,848
Where did you work
for the last time?

111
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,844
In a slaughterhouse,
but was closed down.

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,764
Do you never worked
as a security guard?

113
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,687
Yeah, I worked in a stadium
for six months.

114
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,091
As a night watchman.
And in a parking garage.

115
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,527
Have you done martial arts?

116
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,447
Boxing for 6 years.
And two years of Thai boxing.

117
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:43,708
Can you prove it?
With photos or a license?

118
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,417
I won a regional title
in Belgium.

119
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,125
I have a belt...

120
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,625
- Have you stopped?
- No, my trainer has stopped.

121
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,792
- Why?
- He died.

122
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,167
- Do you smoke?
- No.

123
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,750
Do you drink?

124
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,583
- I didn't hear anything.
- No, I don't drink.

125
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,167
- Do you take drugs?
- No.

126
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,209
Give me a reason to hire you.

127
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,792
Trust me.

128
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,002
Oh that's right.
And what is this?

129
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,242
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

130
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,376
- So?
- Sam, come here.

131
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:28,751
I would say within a week.
Is that his son?

132
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,167
You didn't say
you had a child?

133
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,917
I didn't ask him.

134
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,084
Did you hear
from that customer?

135
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,292
You have cold hands.

136
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,251
Good evening.

137
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:41,542
Good evening.

138
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:43,834
Good evening.

139
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:46,834
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

140
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:49,084
- Good evening!
- Go ahead, girls.

141
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:52,376
- Four against one, I am no match.
- Good evening.

142
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,450
You see? It's easy.
You say what you want.

143
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:02,834
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

144
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,368
When they leave, they remember you,
if they are drunk ...

145
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,291
And had a shitty night, you're there
with a nice thing to say!

146
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:10,709
- Does it work?
- Of course!

147
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,542
Get out!

148
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,376
Oh, okay! Get out!
Please.

149
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,709
Get out!

150
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:46,667
Are you OK?
Keep your head back.

151
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,958
Good. Breathe slowly.

152
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:52,959
Asshole!

153
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,251
Breathe.

154
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,209
I have to go home.

155
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,169
Do you have friends here?

156
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,324
No, it's okay,
I'm alone, I have my car.

157
00:14:03,501 --> 00:14:05,584
- You can't drive like that.
- Yes. I'm fine.

158
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,209
- No, I'll call you a cab.
- No, I have my car.

159
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:10,876
I'm fine already. Thanks.
You're sweet.

160
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,122
- Slut!
- Yeah, you, bitch!

161
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,542
What is it?

162
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,917
- Bitch!
- Hey, shut up!

163
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:18,959
Shit.

164
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,167
It's still bleeding?

165
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,084
No, I'm fine.

166
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,334
Shit.

167
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:30,959
Did you get hurt?

168
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:34,001
Yes, it's starting to swell.
Look.

169
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,417
You go to the Annexe often?

170
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,142
No.

171
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,917
Why do you come alone?

172
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:53,417
To dance?

173
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,334
Yes.

174
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,042
To find a guy?

175
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:00,251
Oh, really?

176
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:04,334
You don't dress like that
just to dance.

177
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,459
How am I dressed?

178
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,084
I don't know ...

179
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,847
Look!

180
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,207
Yeah? So what?

181
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,333
You're dressed like ...
a whore.

182
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,875
Excuse me?

183
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,209
- Are you dressed like what?
- That's enough.

184
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,750
- It's no surprise that the guys ...
- Shut up.

185
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,458
- How do you get back?
- I don't know.

186
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,250
Forget it, I'm fine.

187
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,417
- For the taxi.
- I'm fine. Here.

188
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:45,834
Well, goodnight.

189
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,644
- Do you have some ice?
- What?

190
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,723
Ice cubes.

191
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,281
Wait here, I'll see.

192
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,966
- Can I come along?
- No.

193
00:15:57,417 --> 00:16:00,042
- There's someone upstairs.
- So what?

194
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,042
Wait here. I'll be right back.

195
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,875
Okay.

196
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,626
Come.

197
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,667
- Steph?
- There's ice here.

198
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,083
What happens to you?

199
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,521
- There was a fight.
- Are you okay?

200
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,081
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good evening.

201
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,765
Who is he?

202
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,161
The bouncer from the the Annexe.
He brought me home.

203
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,542
The Annexe?
What were you doing there?

204
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,044
What are you doing?

205
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,680
- I'm packing ice.
- He hurt his hand.

206
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,375
Can we talk for a minute?

207
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:43,834
<i>Hein?</i>

208
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,004
<i>I was waiting like an idiot!
Let me know, this is the least!</i>

209
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,565
<i>Stop bugging me!</i>

210
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,370
<i>- What...?
- Stop bugging me!</i>

211
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,542
- Is it better?
- Yeah, it is.

212
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,931
Is that you in the photos
with the orcas?

213
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:26,292
Yes.

214
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,602
- Is it your job?
- Yes.

215
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:32,384
I'd never have imagined!

216
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,001
Why? Can't a whore train orcas?

217
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:38,417
Great...

218
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,792
Aren't you gone yet?

219
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,125
Are you talking to me?

220
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,875
Go on, please.

221
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,792
Here is my number,
just in case.

222
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,709
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

223
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,333
Are you sulking?

224
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,208
No.

225
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:24,500
- I saw your face just now.
- Just now?

226
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,833
With that guy from the Annexe.

227
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,083
I saw how you piped down.

228
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,924
I piped down? Me?

229
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,321
- Yeah, you piped down.
- Ah...

230
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,458
You aren't
commanding me anymore, Simon.

231
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,542
What do you mean?

232
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,501
You don't give me commands anymore.
That's all.

233
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:26,459
Okay? Duncan, you start
by the reverences.

234
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:28,501
We make the challenge
and a Spy Up.

235
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,667
You start the reverences.

236
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:25,251
I'll make a slide!
OK!

237
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:42,834
We send the reverence!

238
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,917
Watch out!
Steph!

239
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,607
Sam, Get out of it.
It's disgusting.

240
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:17,417
Get out of it, it's disgusting!

241
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,521
Oh!

242
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,811
Get out of it!

243
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,971
Hey!

244
00:23:33,126 --> 00:23:36,084
Come!
Come, shit!

245
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:37,501
It's disgusting!

246
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,376
Don't touch me!

247
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:42,459
Walk!
Anna!

248
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:44,292
Off those pants.

249
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:46,001
Off those pants, I said.

250
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,459
You smell like shit!

251
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,542
Up your arms! Go!

252
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,917
Come here. Come here!

253
00:23:59,709 --> 00:24:02,042
Come, stay here!

254
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,000
- What are you doing?
- Did you watch him?

255
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,440
Yeah, I just hung the laundry.

256
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,209
What have you done?

257
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,249
Don't cry! Don't cry!

258
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,376
- Stop with that.
- Where's my sister?

259
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,001
She's gone.
The truck had a breakdown.

260
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,167
- Look at that.
- Come, I'll wash you.

261
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,925
Don't go back there anymore!

262
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,917
Is anyone there?

263
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
Steph ...

264
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,917
Wait, wait.

265
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:01,250
What happened to my legs?

266
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,625
What happened to my legs?

267
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:19,417
What happened to my legs?

268
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:53,167
I got your brothers on the phone.

269
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:57,458
They want to talk to you
but this is not the time.

270
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,625
Hugo is coming the next holiday.

271
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:07,376
I told myself that
I might lose you.

272
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,001
I don't know what I would have done.

273
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:16,417
I will pray for you.

274
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:18,834
I passed by your house.

275
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:23,084
I saw the housekeeper,
she didn't want me to pay her.

276
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,792
She is very upset.

277
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,167
Give me that.

278
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,375
Give me that
immediately.

279
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,834
Please.

280
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,000
What do you want with it?

281
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,924
I'll take you.

282
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,162
- I'll take you for a walk.
- No.

283
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,402
- Just a litte?
- No, I don't want.

284
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:15,959
Right!

285
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:17,126
Right!

286
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,167
Very good.
Left!

287
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,125
Left, right!

288
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,128
Here, here, here in the middle!

289
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,721
Protect yourself!

290
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,962
Right!

291
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,963
Three!

292
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,084
- You are too static.
- Yeah.

293
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,004
How are you?

294
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,810
- How are you Foued?
- Fine.

295
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,876
- Good morning.
- Ali.

296
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,792
See you soon!

297
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:14,459
Everything alright?

298
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:35,792
Wait a moment.

299
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:41,376
Hello?

300
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:44,667
<i>- You forgot Sam.</i>
- I'm still at the gym.

301
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,751
<i>- You have to pick him up at school.</i>
- I'm going.

302
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,501
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>
- I'm going already!

303
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:13,625
Mister van Versch,
can I talk to you for a moment?

304
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,681
Sorry, ma'am.
I was still at work.

305
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,683
- Have you seen the time?
- Yeah.

306
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,285
This is the third time
in two weeks.

307
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,171
The next time
I'll have to call the police.

308
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,846
No, it's ok.
Sam, come here.

309
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:33,459
- It's going to happen again?
- No, it's okay.

310
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,849
Move on, shit!

311
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:43,334
- It annoys me.
- Don't you like dogs?

312
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,917
- No. Get out!
- He doesn't like acorns.

313
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,924
- Move, move!
- What is it?

314
00:32:49,751 --> 00:32:51,584
And it stinks too!

315
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,327
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

316
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,667
<i>- It's Ali?</i>
- Yes, it's me. Who is it?

317
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,917
<i>- Stéphanie.</i>
- Stéphanie?

318
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,530
<i>We met at the Annexe.
The brawl, the ice ...</i>

319
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,727
Yes, of course.
Stéphanie.

320
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:27,834
How are you?

321
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,002
<i>You know
what happened to me?</i>

322
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,083
I saw it on TV, yes.

323
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,333
<i>So how would I be,
what do you think?</i>

324
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,375
I don’t know.

325
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:44,209
<i>And you, everything ok?</i>

326
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:46,292
Yes, normal.

327
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,167
<i>Are you still a bouncer?</i>

328
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:53,126
No, watchman,
four nights a week.

329
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,042
I'm here...

330
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,625
Come in.

331
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:59,833
- Have you been here long?
- I just arrived.

332
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,167
- Did you rang just now?
- No.

333
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,767
Sit down.

334
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,925
Want something to drink?
Coffee?

335
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:15,626
Yes.

336
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,876
- I only have "Nes".
- That's fine.

337
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:21,376
- Do you want me to help you?
- No.

338
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,882
Have you been living here long?

339
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,811
Since ... Since...

340
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,723
Two... three, four months,
I think.

341
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,324
Nice place.

342
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,250
It is temporary, because ...

343
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,750
I'll do that.

344
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,667
It's fine.

345
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,042
The insurance pays.

346
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:52,542
Do you have anyone to help you?

347
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:55,583
What for? To walk?

348
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,875
No, the household and all that.

349
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:02,292
Yes, all kinds of people come along.

350
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,292
Are you okay?

351
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,042
Are you okay?

352
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,564
Do you think it stinks?

353
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,645
A little bit.

354
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,002
I think I stinks.

355
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:00,042
Come outside.

356
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,126
No, no...

357
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,011
- Yes, put this on.
- No, I don't want to.

358
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,561
- Yeah, let's go outside.
- No, I don't want to!

359
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,417
Wait, watch out.

360
00:37:30,626 --> 00:37:32,167
Watch out!

361
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,841
No, don't push.
I feel sick.

362
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,883
I'll do it.

363
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:42,667
I feel like swimming.

364
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:46,417
Don't you want?

365
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,333
Why?
Don't you have a bathing suit?

366
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,003
Do you realize
what you're saying?

367
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,208
Why?
There's nobody here.

368
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,649
Well... I'm going.

369
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,928
I will go in now.

370
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:28,709
Ah yeah?

371
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,500
Can you give me that towel?

372
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,958
Ready.

373
00:41:11,542 --> 00:41:13,251
How do I do this?

374
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,501
You have to carry me.

375
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:18,167
Hang on.

376
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,500
Don't let me go suddenly.

377
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

378
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:05,084
Wait!

379
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,667
<i>Mom!</i>

380
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,458
Oh damn, this was good!

381
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:30,250
Thank you.

382
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:02,501
Well...

383
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,917
I don't wear that any more.

384
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,750
Garbage.

385
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:18,500
- Garbage, garbage.
- You are throwing good things away.

386
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:22,292
That's good, that dress.
You can wear with pants.

387
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,000
Do you like that?

388
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:31,167
Do you like this dress?

389
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,542
You can have it.

390
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,328
I like this one.

391
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,727
Holy shit.
See those hulks?

392
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,803
Oh shit!

393
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:55,709
I fought against him twice
at the National Tournament.

394
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:57,417
He's not bad!

395
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:02,333
Knee, right, right.
More right, like that ...

396
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:10,000
- What do you want?
- To come inside.

397
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:11,751
Who is it?

398
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:15,542
- Are you Martial?
- Yeah.

399
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:18,167
It's ok,
let him in.

400
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:48,250
- He goes down!
- Look at this.

401
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:50,584
Right...
look at your right.

402
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:53,001
- It's a truck!
- 90, 80 kilos!

403
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,891
- He is not 90!
- At least 85...

404
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:57,626
Look!

405
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,247
He will finish him.

406
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:01,501
Why they don't stop?

407
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:02,584
But this guy ...!

408
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:05,542
Knee, knee, look!

409
00:47:05,709 --> 00:47:07,251
Look! Right!

410
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:10,000
- Do you like it?
- What?

411
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,458
- Fighting?
- Yes.

412
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,161
- Can you fight?
- A little, yes.

413
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,402
Have you ever been in a combat?

414
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:22,542
Long time ago,
boxing and Thai boxing.

415
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:27,000
Would you like to earn money
with it?

416
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:31,667
- Are you kidding me?
- I know a guy who organizes fights.

417
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:35,750
A gypsy.
With gambling and everything.

418
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:38,208
How do you know him?

419
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:42,375
I had cameras installed
in a garage where he stole cars.

420
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:45,542
He wanted the tapes from me.

421
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,564
What kind of boxing?

422
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,200
Like Thai Boxing,
with the feet?

423
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,762
No, you can use everything,
elbows, knees...

424
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,169
You really finish each other!

425
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,958
Who remains last, wins.
You are choking me...

426
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:15,708
- First time doing it?
- Yes.

427
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,250
- Aren't you afraid?
- Afraid of what?

428
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:28,208
- How much do you get?
- I don't know.

429
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:32,500
Five hundred, one thousand.
Depends if I win.

430
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,500
- You fight for 500 euros?
- Yes.

431
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:40,208
Get beat up, put your health at risk,
for 500 euros?

432
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,458
Risk my health?
Don't overdo it!

433
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:52,417
I can give you 500 euros.
Cancel. I'll pay you tomorrow.

434
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:56,833
If you have too much money, sure.
But I said I'd do it.

435
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,570
If it's not the money, so why?

436
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,449
I never said it's not the money.

437
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,562
So why?

438
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:04,960
What a pain!

439
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:08,250
Why? To fight.
For the fun of it.

440
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:12,542
Just like you with your fish.
Why you did that? For the fun.

441
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:15,333
For the money and the fun!

442
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,885
See how I enden up?

443
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,168
Gimme a break!

444
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,750
Where's your wheelchair?

445
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:28,417
When you are fighting...

446
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:31,626
- Can I come with you?
- Yes, sure.

447
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,887
I'll make two moldings
for prosthetics.

448
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,087
To make you walk.

449
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,686
When it's done,

450
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,923
we will put the knees,
pneumatics or electronics...

451
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,131
What is electronic knee?

452
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,523
The knee fixates itself.

453
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,966
Can the feet move?

454
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,771
No, not the feet.
They are from carbon fiber.

455
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,321
They are flexible,
but don't move.

456
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,124
I will walk like a robot?

457
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,282
No, you will walk well!

458
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,011
There are Swedish feet
that are not reimbursed ...

459
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,961
with those you can wear
heels from 10 to 50 mm.

460
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:28,792
That is important for women.

461
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,042
Oh shoot...

462
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:41,417
Stop! Good.

463
00:50:47,667 --> 00:50:50,542
Go. I'll take a cab.

464
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:51,792
No, I'm fine.

465
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,000
Keep an eye on Sam.
The breeder is here.

466
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:35,375
- Hello? Watch your son?
- Yeah, yeah.

467
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:38,125
He should not be in the garden.

468
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,000
Stay with Daddy.
You stay with him, huh?

469
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:50,333
- Sit here.
- You have cold hands.

470
00:51:56,376 --> 00:51:57,501
Don't touch it.

471
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,042
Don't touch it.

472
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,917
Did you see that?

473
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,833
- See how strong he is?
- Who?

474
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,458
- The black pants.
- He?

475
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,708
Wait! Sit here!

476
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,171
Yeah?

477
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,687
What did he say?

478
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,445
Hein?

479
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,165
Why, 'the others'?

480
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,333
How many are there?

481
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:43,000
Damn,
I wasn't expecting that!

482
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,527
Then you fight yourself!

483
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,603
<i>Make them yourself!</i>

484
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:54,209
No, is not!
I don't give a damn!

485
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
Where do the dogs go?

486
00:52:57,667 --> 00:52:59,208
Don't worry,
go back home.

487
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,208
Tell him that
I don't give a damn about it.

488
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,568
What are you doing?

489
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,403
- I told you to not let him go!
- I'm on the phone.

490
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,206
Don't you have
nothing else to do?

491
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,247
Come back!

492
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,767
What the fuck?

493
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,446
Let me go!

494
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,847
What are you doing?

495
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,128
Oh! oh!

496
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,169
Oh! Calm down, yeah?

497
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,324
Damn, you're pissing me off!

498
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,010
You understood?

499
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,610
Come here, come.

500
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,366
- He has nothing.
- Get out!

501
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,847
- But...
- Don't touch him and get out!

502
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,924
- He has nothing, shit.
- Don't touch him!

503
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,320
I said get out! Shit!

504
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,333
It's over.

505
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:12,208
- Martial, slowly, fuck!
- Put her belt on then.

506
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,750
Fasten your belt.

507
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,727
Who is she?

508
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,405
His girlfriend.

509
00:54:28,542 --> 00:54:30,958
Okay. Go ahead.

510
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,250
That guy is imitating
what he saw on TV.

511
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,792
Who are those guys?

512
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,875
Dealers, figures with money.

513
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:00,708
- Are you OK?
- Yes, fine.

514
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:10,250
- In case of problems, lie down.
- How much are the bets?

515
00:55:10,417 --> 00:55:14,542
Over 2000.
But will go up.

516
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,727
And what do I do?

517
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,041
No women.
You stay in the car.

518
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:18,834
Are you ready?

519
00:55:19,626 --> 00:55:20,917
Come on!

520
00:56:20,792 --> 00:56:23,042
That was fast.

521
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,500
- Do you have to go again?
- What?

522
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,125
Yes, another fight after.

523
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:38,792
I need to run!

524
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,167
Fuck!

525
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:52,000
Stop right there.
I want to take a shower.

526
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,408
What is that?

527
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,683
- For whom is that?
- For my son.

528
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:20,750
- Do you have a son?
- Yes.

529
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,367
Let's go!

530
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,376
You're never there and
when you're there, he gets hit.

531
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:51,584
Don't exaggerate!

532
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,524
But you beat him!

533
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,331
Accidentally.
He's not dead.

534
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:58,792
Why did you brought him with you?

535
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,406
It would be better
if he had stayed there.

536
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,125
This is for you.

537
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,128
- What is it?
- This is what I owe you.

538
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,567
- How did you get that?
- I won a fight.

539
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,121
Fight?
What fight?

540
01:00:13,126 --> 01:00:16,001
Is that your work?
Get beaten up?

541
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:18,251
Do you take it or not?

542
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:21,042
Don't look at me like that,
please. Shit!

543
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,888
I cheated!

544
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:34,084
Who is winning?

545
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,888
Do you like it?

546
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,529
Oh... Do you like it?

547
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,523
Yes. Yes, Ali.

548
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,246
- Shall we go swimming?
- Yes. Yes, Ali.

549
01:00:59,209 --> 01:01:02,501
Look! You're stronger,
you're stronger than them.

550
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,334
You're stronger than them?

551
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,443
- Give daddy a kiss.
- I don't want to.

552
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,927
Yes, you want.
Give daddy a kiss!

553
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,206
- No!
- Yes!

554
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,001
Yes!

555
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,209
No! I don't want to!

556
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,626
Shut up!

557
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,917
Oh, damn!

558
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,792
Put it there.

559
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:31,125
That's it.
Come back now.

560
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,333
Come back.

561
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:39,329
My job is not
watching the customers.

562
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,329
But watching the staff.

563
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,917
Suppose you're the manager
of a supermarket.

564
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:49,917
You have too many staff around.
What do you do?

565
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:53,917
- I fire them.
- There must be a good reason!

566
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,848
You try to know if they stay
too long in the toilet,

567
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,209
or if they pauses too long.

568
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,887
You should build up pressure.
Those who don't quit, you fire.

569
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,403
That's what my cameras are for.

570
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,570
I work for the managers.

571
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,927
For bosses in their
three-piece suits.

572
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,889
It's overwhelming.

573
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,123
There is no big supermarket
without my cameras.

574
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:23,042
Is that legal?

575
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:26,208
Legal? Who determines that?

576
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:31,083
But if a manager gets caught,
he has a trial on his ass.

577
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,708
And I go to jail.

578
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,500
Left! left!
On your left!

579
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,083
Wait, I'll wave!

580
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,708
Shit, that's brilliant.

581
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:04,417
- How long?
- Two days.

582
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:16,042
- Can I see?
- Yeah.

583
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,625
We go swimming?

584
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,250
In the beach? I don't know.

585
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:41,375
It's different now.
I don't know if I want to undress.

586
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,566
Do you have a girlfriend?
A fiancée?

587
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,767
No.

588
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,888
No love life at all?

589
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:58,251
Yes, but no fiancée.

590
01:04:59,126 --> 01:05:02,084
what is it?
Only to fuck?

591
01:05:02,792 --> 01:05:03,667
Yeah.

592
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
- Do you have many flings?
- No.

593
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,207
Does it annoy you
to talk about it?

594
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,249
No, I don't care.

595
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,458
And you, were you
with a lot of guys?

596
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:25,501
- Before?
- Yes.

597
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,834
I was with Simon.

598
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:31,042
Is that all?

599
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:35,208
No, there were others,
but not many.

600
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,417
I was very ...

601
01:05:39,917 --> 01:05:42,334
I liked being watched.

602
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,751
I liked turning them on.

603
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:50,917
I liked getting them excited.

604
01:05:52,501 --> 01:05:55,084
But then,
I'd get bored.

605
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:00,459
And now?

606
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:03,876
Nothing.

607
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:10,417
I forgot what it's like.

608
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:14,208
I don't know if it still works.

609
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:16,917
No more desire?

610
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:20,458
I never said that.
Sure I feel desire.

611
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,000
Let's change the subject.

612
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:29,584
- I'll do it.
- No, wait.

613
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:32,126
I have legs, they must serve me.

614
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,417
Do you want to fuck?

615
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:41,959
Huh?

616
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:43,709
What?

617
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:49,167
You want to know if it still works?
So, let's fuck.

618
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,889
Just like that?

619
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,691
Yeah!

620
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:05,750
I don't know if I can do it
just like that.

621
01:07:06,875 --> 01:07:09,292
When you feel like it, tell me.

622
01:07:13,167 --> 01:07:14,167
Wait ...

623
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:05,251
Come ... Come!

624
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,792
Do you mind if we don't kiss
on the mouth?

625
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,292
No, it's OK.

626
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:53,917
And on your breasts, can I?

627
01:08:54,626 --> 01:08:55,584
Yes.

628
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:06,709
Wait, you're crushing me...

629
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:10,042
- You gotta stop talking now.
- Ok.

630
01:09:15,209 --> 01:09:16,917
Slowly ...

631
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:24,876
Slowly.

632
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:28,084
Slowly ...

633
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:55,459
Are you OK?

634
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,292
Was it good?

635
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:02,292
It still works?

636
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:04,709
Yes.

637
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:07,209
No ...
I don't know ...

638
01:10:08,126 --> 01:10:10,834
It's different.
It's hard to say after just one ...

639
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:13,376
Yeah but I can't now.
I have to go.

640
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,881
That's not what I meant.

641
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:19,500
- It's new, so ...
- Was it good or not?

642
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:21,959
Yes, it was good.

643
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:28,125
Well, when you feel like it, call me.
If I'm OP, I'll come.

644
01:10:29,209 --> 01:10:30,917
What does that mean, 'OP'?

645
01:10:31,084 --> 01:10:34,084
Operational.
When I'm available, when I can.

646
01:10:35,458 --> 01:10:38,333
- When you're OP, we ...
- Yes.

647
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,208
What?

648
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,833
Nothing, it's great.

649
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,083
I'm going. Bye.

650
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:14,667
Are you OK?

651
01:14:14,834 --> 01:14:17,084
Stéphanie!

652
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:19,917
<i>Good to see you!</i>

653
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,770
Oh, thank you... Yes.

654
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,048
It's true, I missed.

655
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:51,333
<i>OP?</i>

656
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:30,250
Oh shit,
get dressed, quickly!

657
01:15:30,417 --> 01:15:32,292
- What is it?
- My sister.

658
01:15:34,501 --> 01:15:36,709
Shit, you scared me!

659
01:15:36,876 --> 01:15:39,834
- I am with a friend.
- Do you bring girls now?

660
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:42,417
Stéphanie, come here,
I will introduce you to my sister!

661
01:15:42,584 --> 01:15:44,451
- It's the girl from Marineland.
- What?

662
01:15:44,517 --> 01:15:47,167
- The girl from Marineland.
- Ah...

663
01:15:49,084 --> 01:15:50,959
Oh shit, poor girl.

664
01:15:51,126 --> 01:15:53,501
- Good morning.
- Anna ... Stéphanie.

665
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,375
Four times.

666
01:15:58,542 --> 01:16:00,458
That's enough!

667
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,921
- That's him?
- Yeah...

668
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:11,083
Good morning!

669
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:27,583
- How old is he?
- Five.

670
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,667
I don't have more grapefruit!

671
01:16:30,834 --> 01:16:34,376
- No problem.
- I've got multivitamine juice.

672
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:36,292
- Do you drink tea?
- No.

673
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,807
- I'll make some tea.
- No, it's OK!

674
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,042
- Sit down.
- This is perfect!

675
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,680
<i>No, it's OK!</i>

676
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,446
- Don't you wanna go?
- Why?

677
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,529
She pisses me off with her tea.

678
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,889
- She's very nice.
- Yeah, very nice ...

679
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,407
She feels like a cashier
with you.

680
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,849
- Here.
- Thank you.

681
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,442
Thank you.

682
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,443
- Do you sleep here?
- Yes.

683
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,371
Nice room.

684
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,208
Why are you looking at me
like that?

685
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,208
It scares you?

686
01:17:27,667 --> 01:17:30,167
- Want to see it?
- Yes.

687
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:43,875
Does it hurt?

688
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,764
No.

689
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,042
Feel it.

690
01:18:12,126 --> 01:18:13,959
<i>Yeah! Again!</i>

691
01:18:14,126 --> 01:18:16,376
<i>Again! Go!</i>

692
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:19,376
<i>Come on, go!</i>

693
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:27,751
You go, you pass...

694
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:30,709
You put your hand here.

695
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:37,458
This hand here, will search
the leg on the other side.

696
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,208
Same movement.

697
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:46,626
Go ... That's good.

698
01:18:49,417 --> 01:18:52,209
Go!

699
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:49,334
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not.

700
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:51,459
That guy will kill me.

701
01:19:53,334 --> 01:19:54,376
Are you ready?

702
01:22:05,626 --> 01:22:07,501
VIP Area, OK?

703
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:52,251
Do you want to move?

704
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:54,001
To dance?

705
01:22:54,876 --> 01:22:55,917
Come on!

706
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:00,125
I'll go.

707
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:08,376
- Here.
- Thank you.

708
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:19,001
I'm going.
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

709
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:21,292
- Are you going?
- Yeah, I'm going!

710
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,527
Guys, until next time.
Thank you very much!

711
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,320
Thank you!

712
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,000
Until next time!

713
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:54,542
Do you want to drink
something?

714
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:58,250
Do you want to drink
something?

715
01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:00,583
Yes, champagne.

716
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:03,208
Two champagne Mika!

717
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,842
My name is Pierre.
And yours?

718
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,082
- My name is Marie.
- Marie?

719
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,917
Do you come here often?

720
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:13,001
Occasionally.

721
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:35,805
Oh no.

722
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,804
I'm sorry, not tonight,
I don't feel like it.

723
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:39,847
Don't worry.

724
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,090
I'm going.
Thanks for the drink.

725
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:46,366
No, it's OK.

726
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,571
Sorry, I ...

727
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,005
Sorry for what?

728
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,322
- I didn't know ...
- What you didn't know?

729
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,329
I couldn't know that ...

730
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,727
That you have a ...
That you did not have ...

731
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,584
What you couldn't know?
Asshole!

732
01:26:09,876 --> 01:26:11,751
Look what she did to me!

733
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,292
Don't touch it!

734
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,167
Everything alright?

735
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:19,625
- You guys stayed late?
- I don't know.

736
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,625
- And you, how was it?
- Normal.

737
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:33,583
You think this is
a normal conversation?

738
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:39,000
I ask you how went with the girl
and you answer 'normal'.

739
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:41,750
What should I say?

740
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,684
Nothing.

741
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:47,966
What?

742
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,522
Do you think it's 'normal' 
to pick up a bimbo in front of me?

743
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,206
- What would you say if I did that?
- Nothing.

744
01:27:54,376 --> 01:27:55,376
Oh, really?

745
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:57,334
- Wouldn't you care?
- Shit!

746
01:27:57,501 --> 01:28:00,917
Stop, damn! You're being a pain.
What's the problem?

747
01:28:02,751 --> 01:28:04,626
What am I for you?

748
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,459
A friend?

749
01:28:06,917 --> 01:28:08,083
A girlfriend?

750
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,958
A buddy, like Foued
and the others?

751
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:13,750
Do you fuck your buddies?

752
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,848
If you want to continue,
we have to do things right.

753
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:27,792
Let's show some manners.

754
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:31,501
I'm talking about delicacy.

755
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:37,375
You know what it is. You've always
been so delicate with me.

756
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:44,209
We'll do like this?

757
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,583
We'll continue,
but not like animals.

758
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,833
What is it?

759
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:06,125
I'm OP.

760
01:29:08,583 --> 01:29:11,375
That's it, I am OP.

761
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:14,500
Why are you looking
at me like that?

762
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:16,959
- Don't you want it?
- No.

763
01:29:20,917 --> 01:29:22,917
Why not?

764
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,243
Calm down or I'll have
the store evacuated.

765
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,449
- Don't bother.
- We'll call the police!

766
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:23,721
The police!

767
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:25,792
Remove the stuff.

768
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,928
They will see that you spy!

769
01:30:28,084 --> 01:30:30,459
- We will close the store.
- That's it!

770
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:33,834
Don't you dare
even looking at us!

771
01:30:34,001 --> 01:30:36,167
Don't touch me.

772
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:40,542
The guy is wrong and wants to call
the police! Bravo!

773
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,842
What are you doing?

774
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,684
I'm packing up.

775
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:53,333
- Are yours?
- No.

776
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,801
No photos!

777
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,530
Do you work for them?

778
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,091
No photos, I said!

779
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,924
You were filming us!

780
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:03,125
I'll beat you, shut up!

781
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:05,500
Come on, let's get out!

782
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,443
We got you!

783
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,563
Shut up!

784
01:31:15,501 --> 01:31:18,251
I have to go away
for three or four months.

785
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:23,833
Ali wants to continue fighting.
Would you like to replace me?

786
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,610
But does he agree?

787
01:31:28,751 --> 01:31:31,251
He's the one who asked me
to call you.

788
01:31:34,226 --> 01:31:35,465
Why me?

789
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:37,501
He trusts you, I guess.

790
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:40,875
I don't know nothing about that world.
I don't know those guys.

791
01:31:42,501 --> 01:31:44,501
Do you see me dealing
with those beasts?

792
01:31:45,126 --> 01:31:46,167
Yes.

793
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:47,584
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

794
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:53,917
Everything is in here.
If you have questions, let me know.

795
01:31:56,167 --> 01:32:00,708
- And the bets?
- You have fingers to count.

796
01:32:01,001 --> 01:32:02,709
- Here, the Clio.
- No, no.

797
01:32:02,876 --> 01:32:05,376
This?

798
01:32:05,542 --> 01:32:07,834
I noticed that you have a problem ...

799
01:32:08,001 --> 01:32:10,501
Yeah. I want an automatic.

800
01:32:10,667 --> 01:32:12,542
This is what
you need.

801
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,609
No, that's ugly.

802
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:48,875
RIGHT

803
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:38,876
What's up, Robocop?

804
01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:40,334
This is a circus!

805
01:33:40,501 --> 01:33:42,084
- How much is it?
- 3400.

806
01:33:42,251 --> 01:33:44,376
- 3400?
- Are you ready?

807
01:34:12,583 --> 01:34:14,667
I'm here.

808
01:34:16,959 --> 01:34:18,917
Don't look at me like that.

809
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:22,042
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to pee.

810
01:34:24,376 --> 01:34:26,251
Can you give me my t-shirt?

811
01:34:26,417 --> 01:34:28,376
- What time is it?
- Six o'clock.

812
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:34,167
Shit, I've fallen asleep.

813
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,602
I don't want you
to see me like this.

814
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,603
Hold on.

815
01:34:39,751 --> 01:34:41,001
Come here.

816
01:34:54,792 --> 01:34:57,000
It's OK?

817
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,917
What?
What's the matter?

818
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:28,125
Can we do this now?

819
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,825
LEFT

820
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,568
- The management wants to see you.
- What?

821
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,881
The management wants to see you.

822
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:06,850
- Wait here.
- Here?

823
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,525
Yes.

824
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,286
You too?

825
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,963
<i>Do you know
why we're here?</i>

826
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,324
So?

827
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,526
- I got fired.
- Don't worry, sweetie.

828
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:43,569
There's something
we want to show you.

829
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:47,521
That's it.

830
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,682
Here he packs up the stuff.

831
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,161
And here he wanted to beat me.

832
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:59,011
Then he go away.
But I've caught him in flagrante.

833
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,570
Are you okay?

834
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,564
What are you doing?

835
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,961
- I'm hungry.
- Close it.

836
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,684
You don't eat here.

837
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,649
You don't eat here!

838
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,564
Are you kidding me?

839
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,209
I was fired this morning.
I'm unemployed.

840
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,610
What's the relation
with I can't eat here?

841
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:16,284
What's the relation?
There's cameras in the warehouse.

842
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:21,051
They filmed us when we took
the expired food. They fired us.

843
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:23,123
You had your sister fired.

844
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:29,667
How does it feel?

845
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:34,708
How much did you get for that?

846
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:38,083
You get paid per person
or a flat rate?

847
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,804
You don't say anything?

848
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:49,127
I give you shelter, I take care
of your son, you make me fired.

849
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,044
But you have nothing to say!

850
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:52,667
Great.

851
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,687
- I couldn't know.
- Yeah, you couldn't know.

852
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:59,649
But I don't understand.

853
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:03,042
How can you do
such a thing?

854
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,440
Which side are you?
You're with them?

855
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,846
Shit, what do you have
in your head?

856
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,525
What didn't you know?

857
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:15,127
That you'd bring us into shit?

858
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,964
Can't you think?

859
01:39:37,792 --> 01:39:39,917
Calm down!

860
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:42,667
Calm down, I said.

861
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:45,833
Take your stuff
and get out of here.

862
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,047
We don't want to see you
around here anymore.

863
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,689
Come on, get out!

864
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,760
<i>OP?</i>

865
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,007
This is the mess
he left behind.

866
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,220
In his message he said
he was in Strasbourg.

867
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,683
I don't know what
he's doing there.

868
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,320
- Didn't he call you?
- No.

869
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,841
Have you been to the gym?

870
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,889
They don't know nothing.

871
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,930
If I had an address or a number,
I'd give it to you.

872
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,280
I'm sure this is bullshit
after what he did to me.

873
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,131
Do you believe me?

874
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:36,846
Yeah, I believe you.

875
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,685
Do you not realize?
He left his kid.

876
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,922
He doesn't care about anything!

877
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,765
- You don't know him.
- Me? I don't know him?

878
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:48,003
- What did you expect from him?
- I don't know.

879
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,207
Not this.

880
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:53,375
To the right.
Raise your hands.

881
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,804
Faster. Raise your hands,
focus your blows.

882
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:06,583
<i>- Is there any coffee left?
- Coffee?</i>

883
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,860
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

884
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,667
- Are you okay?
- Yes. And you?

885
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,207
I will not further,
otherwise I'll get stuck.

886
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,840
Do you got a new truck now?

887
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,004
I changed my boss.
I'm back to the exploiters.

888
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,685
Ali?

889
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,049
- Sam, put your jacket on!
- Everything okay at home?

890
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,843
Yeah, everything okay.

891
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,047
And Anna?

892
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:07,850
Fine. She found a job
in a school canteen.

893
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,604
She seems to like it.

894
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:16,458
- Does she know this?
- Of course.

895
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,605
Tell her that I can't help now.
But when I have money ...

896
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,922
- Okay?
- Don't worry, go.

897
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,084
- When will you fight?
- Next month, on the 9th.

898
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:28,287
You tell us?

899
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:30,169
Sure.

900
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,881
Come on, Sam.
I give you Mr. Sam!

901
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:35,926
My mittens!

902
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:38,560
A kiss!
Come on, hop!

903
01:44:39,125 --> 01:44:41,542
Handover.

904
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,958
I'll deliver my load in Colmar
and pick up the kid at 19hrs.

905
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,128
Ali? I count on you: 19hrs.

906
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:55,250
- Okay.
- I have to be back tomorrow at 11hrs.

907
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:57,101
- Okay, don't worry.
- Have a nice day.

908
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:58,685
Thank you.
Goodbye!

909
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,647
Sam, you make a snowman?

910
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,007
- Goodbye!
- Have a nice day!

911
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,891
- I'll bring fries for you!
- OK!

912
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:16,926
I want to skate, too.

913
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,608
It's not skate,
it's ski.

914
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,001
- It's Skate.
- No, it's Ski.

915
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,969
Skate!

916
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:27,763
- Ski.
- You're annoying me.

917
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,206
Sam!

918
01:45:34,833 --> 01:45:37,708
Faster!

919
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:40,958
I'll let you go.
Then you can do it yourself.

920
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:44,041
Go, go!

921
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:46,168
Oh shit!

922
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,646
Watch out!
Take the sled!

923
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,529
Sit on it!

924
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:35,333
One, two, three ... go!

925
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:50,333
Oh shit!

926
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,882
Again.

927
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:03,010
- We are going back in 10 minutes, OK?
- Yes!

928
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,011
<i>Ouch.</i>

929
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:24,110
Sam!

930
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:28,528
Sam!

931
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,931
Sam!

932
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,325
Sam!

933
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,364
Sam!

934
01:48:00,167 --> 01:48:01,333
Help!

935
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,602
Sam!

936
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,329
Come on!

937
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:59,962
Sam! Sam!

938
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:02,365
Sam!

939
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,750
We'll take care of you now.

940
01:50:07,542 --> 01:50:09,583
Come.

941
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:06,724
Can you hold?

942
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,644
Yes, thank you.

943
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,401
Thank you.

944
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,004
Hello?

945
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:33,730
Hum...

946
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:37,292
Yes, it's better.

947
01:51:37,458 --> 01:51:40,458
I will pass to him.

948
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:42,625
Here. She wants to talk to you.

949
01:51:42,792 --> 01:51:45,167
- It's Anna?
- No.

950
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,084
Hello?

951
01:51:48,792 --> 01:51:51,000
<i>It's me.</i>

952
01:51:52,375 --> 01:51:54,833
<i>It bothers you?</i>

953
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,792
No.

954
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:02,042
<i>How is he?</i>

955
01:52:02,208 --> 01:52:05,208
He woke up an hour ago.

956
01:52:08,375 --> 01:52:12,125
<i>- Is he injured?</i>
- No, I don't think so.

957
01:52:14,083 --> 01:52:16,667
<i>And how are you?</i>

958
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:19,875
I broke my hands
on the ice.

959
01:52:21,792 --> 01:52:24,083
<i>Is it serious?</i>

960
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:27,042
They're fractured.

961
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:36,458
And are you okay?

962
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:38,500
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

963
01:52:38,667 --> 01:52:43,542
- What are you doing?
<i>- At this moment? In life?</i>

964
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:46,375
<i>- Or in general?</i>
- I wanted to say that ...

965
01:52:46,542 --> 01:52:50,750
<i>I'm not asking for anything.
I'm hanging up.</i>

966
01:52:50,917 --> 01:52:54,875
<i>I'll call you to ask about Sam.
Give him a kiss?</i>

967
01:52:55,042 --> 01:52:57,208
Don't hang up!

968
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,244
Don't hang up!

969
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:03,368
<i>I won't hang up.</i>

970
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,647
For three hours...

971
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:16,087
He's was in a coma.

972
01:53:16,833 --> 01:53:19,500
For three hours,
he was dead.

973
01:53:22,375 --> 01:53:25,333
I was scared to lose him.

974
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,165
Don't leave me!

975
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:36,051
<i>I won't leave you...</i>

976
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,124
I love you.

977
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:13,750
<i>In a human hand
there are 27 bones.</i>

978
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,641
<i>Some apes have more.</i>

979
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:20,770
<i>A gorilla has 32,
five in each thumb.</i>

980
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:23,048
<i>A human has 27.</i>

981
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:25,646
<i>If you break an arm
or a leg ...</i>

982
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:29,603
<i>The bone grows back together
by calcification.</i>

983
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,721
<i>It will be stronger
than before.</i>

984
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:38,604
<i>If you break a bone in your hand,
it will never recover completely.</i>

985
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:45,081
<i>Before every fight, you'll think.
In each slap, you'll think.</i>

986
01:54:46,417 --> 01:54:48,625
<i>You'll be careful.</i>

987
01:54:48,792 --> 01:54:52,292
<i>But at some point...
the pain will come back.</i>

988
01:54:53,667 --> 01:54:56,042
<i>Like needles.</i>

989
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:58,708
<i>Like glass splinters.</i>
