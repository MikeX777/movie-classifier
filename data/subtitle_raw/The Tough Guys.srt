00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:35,708
<i>Hi</i>.
<i>My name is Modulf</i>.

2
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:39,988
<i>That's Norse for "wolf" and "wrath"</i>.

3
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:46,788
<i>But I'm not as dangerous as I sound</i>.

4
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,352
<i>Actually, I'm pretty nice</i>.

5
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:59,675
<i>I save everyone</i>.

6
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:12,628
<i>Frank and Jørgen are</i>
<i>who I save everyone from</i>.

7
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:14,988
Dumbulf, was that you?

8
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,110
<i>I'm usually called</i>
<i>something other than Modulf</i>.

9
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:20,149
Answer me, garbage face!

10
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:25,148
Think that's your dad calling?

11
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,472
<i>Jørgen knows my dad is dead</i>.

12
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:33,908
<i>Dad said real heroes</i>
<i>protect the weak</i>.

13
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:36,108
I asked if that was you!

14
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:39,435
<i>First I have to act reluctant</i>.

15
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,435
-What's this about?
-What?

16
00:01:42,558 --> 00:01:47,029
That skinny little face of yours
pisses me off!

17
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:48,796
You make me sick!

18
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:51,068
<i>Then I have to annoy them</i>.

19
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,711
My face isn't skinny.

20
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:58,233
Stop it, guys!

21
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:03,953
Damn, my pants got dirty!

22
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:05,557
And my shoes!

23
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:08,909
You'll pay for this.
Tomorrow!

24
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:19,477
<i>I don't like it, but it's better that</i>
<i>I get pestered than someone else</i>.

25
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,158
<i>Because I can handle it</i>.

26
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:25,793
<i>I'm actually a kind of</i>...<i>superhero</i>.

27
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:39,594
HOMEWORK:
WRITE ABOUT AN INVENTION

28
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,746
THE TOUGH GUYS

29
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,348
<i>Once I was asked</i>
<i>why I don't fight back</i>.

30
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:16,552
<i>But imagine if everyone</i>
<i>who got picked on, fought back!</i>

31
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,909
<i>We'd end up with chaos</i>.

32
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:31,190
Modulf?

33
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:36,309
Modulf!
What happened this time?

34
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:41,066
It was totally awesome!
I was playing football.

35
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,634
With all my friends.
The score was 5-5.

36
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:47,875
And then I scored
this incredible goal!

37
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:51,748
And all my friends cheered.
Yeah!

38
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:54,153
And they carried me around.

39
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:57,668
Cool things seem to happen to you
every day.

40
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,632
Aren't you happy
that I do lots of cool stuff?

41
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:05,751
Sure.
I just end up with so much laundry.

42
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:10,036
Listen, your birthday is next week.

43
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:12,911
Do you want to invite your friends?

44
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:18,590
Mom, I'll be twelve. I'm too old
for birthday parties now.

45
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:28,029
OFFICE

46
00:06:30,878 --> 00:06:34,234
DAYS OF MISSING

47
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,157
Hi!

48
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,511
<i>Hi!</i>

49
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,307
Captain Hugo, at your service.

50
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:34,635
Easy, boy, we come in peace.

51
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:38,314
We're your new neighbors.

52
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:40,794
Hi!
My name's Lise.

53
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:42,997
And you're Modulf?

54
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,797
Class 6B?

55
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,232
Then we're classmates.

56
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:55,072
Maybe we can
walk to school together tomorrow?

57
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:59,435
<i>No!</i>
<i>She's the perfect bullying victim</i>.

58
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:04,632
<i>If Frank and Jørgen see me</i>
<i>with Lise, she's as good as dead!</i>

59
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:23,312
She asked if you want
to walk to school together.

60
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,432
Modulf!

61
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,597
Let's say...eight o'clock?

62
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:36,066
13 hours and five minutes.

63
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,314
Yes, that's perfect.

64
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:41,316
Excellent!
I'll see you then.

65
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:45,632
Shit, shit, shit...

66
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:53,671
<i>Maybe everything will be fine</i>.

67
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,030
<i>Maybe they won't even notice her</i>.

68
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:03,630
I'm OK!

69
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,630
<i>Disaster!</i>

70
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:18,352
<i>If I'm going to save Lise,</i>
<i>I'll need to wear my crisis clothes</i>.

71
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,276
Hi!

72
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:51,268
-Hi...
-I figured you wanted to be early.

73
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:55,757
-We agreed on eight o'clock.
-I got up early today.

74
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,669
OK...

75
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:11,628
-What do you do here in Lillehammer?
-The usual. A little of everything.

76
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:14,434
Listen...

77
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,470
-We have to talk.
-About what?

78
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:23,712
-We shouldn't be seen together.
-Don't you want to walk with me?

79
00:10:23,838 --> 00:10:27,513
I do, but you should
get to know the others instead.

80
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:32,189
-I'm friends with who I want.
-Frank and Jørgen! Run!

81
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:37,354
Come on! It's some boys from school.
They're dangerous.

82
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:40,431
-What are we doing?
-It's a shortcut.

83
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,636
Come on!

84
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:08,230
-Got yourself a girlfriend, Dumbulf?
-Your clothes are a perfect match.

85
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:10,868
We can wear whatever we want!

86
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:12,795
She's my new neighbor.

87
00:11:12,918 --> 00:11:14,397
Hi, I'm Lise.

88
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:22,711
Did you do my homework
about an invention?

89
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:25,352
Yes, the Swiss Army knife.

90
00:11:39,038 --> 00:11:42,235
-His name wasn't Carl Elsener.
-Huh?

91
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,872
Modulf made all of that up.

92
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:47,114
-You made it up?
-No!

93
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:53,152
The inventor of the Swiss Army knife
was called Swiss Army.

94
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:55,792
-Are you trying to trick us?!
-No!

95
00:11:55,918 --> 00:12:00,116
Just like Hank Snowboard
and Linus Lego.

96
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:03,674
-It comes from the inventor's name.
-Keep going.

97
00:12:03,798 --> 00:12:07,632
Swiss Army loved chocolate, but...

98
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:10,511
<i>Lise is completely nuts!</i>

99
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:16,156
<i>She clearly doesn't understand how</i>
<i>dangerous Frank and Jørgen are</i>.

100
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,834
Find your seats.

101
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,066
We have a new girl in our class.
Applause!

102
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,746
Hi!
My name is Lise, and I'm from Vinstra.

103
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:43,430
I have also lived in Japan,
Switzerland and six months in Spain.

104
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:48,632
And I love mountain climbing. Guess
how many mountains I have climbed?

105
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:52,512
You can ask me during recess.
I have climbed tons!

106
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:55,717
Excellent. Not bad.
Applause.

107
00:12:56,918 --> 00:13:01,309
-Thank you!
-I thought you could sit with Modulf.

108
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:04,908
Not bad, eh, Modulf?
A new neighbor.

109
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:06,835
Here you go.

110
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,518
Have a seat.
Excellent.

111
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:12,232
Wow, cool pants, Modulf!

112
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,067
I had the exact same pair
when I went to school. Cool!

113
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:24,116
All right.
Everyone has found their seats.

114
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:27,753
Time to hear from your homework.

115
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:34,954
Who would like to begin?

116
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:39,997
Who besides Modulf?

117
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:42,832
Any volunteers?
Come on.

118
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,869
Watch this.

119
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:46,837
No one?

120
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:51,390
Frank!

121
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:56,668
What a rare treat!
Go ahead, read.

122
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,468
Excellent.

123
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:04,348
"Swiss Army."

124
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:08,107
"Swiss Army was the name of the man -

125
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,991
- who invented the Swiss Army knife."

126
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,586
"He loved chocolate."

127
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,672
"But he found chocolate
too hard to cut."

128
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,908
"So he invented a new chocolate
called Swiss Chocolate."

129
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:26,557
"It was much softer
and easier to cut."

130
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:33,392
Did you really do your homework,
Frank?

131
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:38,028
Yes.
He invented Swiss cheese, too.

132
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:41,468
He found out
it was more airy with holes.

133
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:52,949
OK, that's enough.
Calm down.

134
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:55,956
Let's take this from the beginning.

135
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:59,549
Switzerland...
Let's see...

136
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:01,873
<i>Tricked you!</i>

137
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,948
Did you see Frank's face?

138
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:29,350
Success!

139
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,708
I'm kind of in a hurry.

140
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:35,591
Want to walk home together?

141
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:40,268
I think I have to go to the bathroom.

142
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:02,395
This is so serious
we'll deal with it after school.

143
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:06,510
-Why not now?
-This time it's about us.

144
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,913
We have a reputation to uphold.

145
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:12,917
After school,
four-eyes is going to pay!

146
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:18,148
But it was my idea, not Lise's.
She's innocent.

147
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:22,713
Any friend of Dumbulf's
is an enemy of ours!

148
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:36,387
Real heroes protect the weak.

149
00:16:41,718 --> 00:16:46,428
Could you wait for me out front?
I forgot my gym shorts.

150
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:51,187
Mom goes bananas
if I leave them at school.

151
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:54,913
Sounds just like my dad.
I'll wait out front.

152
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,709
Are you looking for me?

153
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:52,595
Where's four-eyes?

154
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,594
-Her name is Lise.
-Where is she?

155
00:17:57,558 --> 00:17:59,594
I don't know, at home?

156
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:07,031
<i>I once read about a boy who had</i>
<i>Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome</i>.

157
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:10,787
<i>A disorder</i>
<i>in which you can't feel pain</i>.

158
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:15,274
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>I wish I had that disorder</i>.

159
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:19,155
<i>Then I could just hang here</i>
<i>and feel nothing</i>.

160
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,188
-I bet he'll get a nosebleed.
-You're on.

161
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:27,594
Come on.
Mom's waiting with dinner.

162
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:30,915
Relax.
We're thinking here.

163
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:35,306
All right.
I bet he'll get a concussion.

164
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:42,835
Two against one is unfair.

165
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:47,156
-There she is!
-Go away, Lise. I'll handle this.

166
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:49,633
I'm in full control!

167
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,273
I'm calling the police.

168
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,390
-You're squealing to the cops?!
-No!

169
00:18:57,198 --> 00:19:00,873
You expect me to let you torture him?

170
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:05,708
It isn't my fault you didn't get
that I tricked you with your homework.

171
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:08,069
Let him go, or else...

172
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:10,230
OK!

173
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:15,036
-Just take it easy.
-Yeah, take it easy, Lise.

174
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:23,157
-But we aren't done yet!
-No one messes with us.

175
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:27,233
"No one messes with us."
Boy, am I scared!

176
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:29,831
Just ignore her.

177
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:38,151
-Let's go, Lise.
-Bye, chickens!

178
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,271
Sorry!

179
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,913
-You lost the bet.
-Huh?

180
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,996
You saw he got a nosebleed.

181
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,591
You never should have done that!

182
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,755
No one has ever
beaten up Frank before.

183
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:16,709
I didn't beat him up.

184
00:20:16,838 --> 00:20:20,672
I used aikido
to protect the two of us.

185
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,308
I learned it in Japan.

186
00:20:26,238 --> 00:20:28,832
You have ruined everything!

187
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:34,994
-You'd prefer to get beat up?
-Yes, actually.

188
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:38,394
Are you completely off your rocker?

189
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,596
You don't understand.

190
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:46,146
No, stupid Lise is just
an ignorant girl from out of town.

191
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:49,956
The thing is...

192
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:51,875
The thing is what?

193
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,597
As long as
Frank and Jørgen pick on me, -

194
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:59,869
- they stay away from the other kids.

195
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:03,994
That's how I protect the others.

196
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:09,952
So you think
you're some kind of superhero?

197
00:21:11,678 --> 00:21:16,354
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard. You're nuts!

198
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,267
Totally brain dead.

199
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:23,028
That's called bullying, Modulf.

200
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:31,869
I happen to be protecting
those other kids!

201
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:52,113
Modulf,
I've told you not to come in here.

202
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:57,391
Dad always said -

203
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:01,268
- that real heroes protect the weak.

204
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:06,873
What did dad do when
things didn't go as he had hoped?

205
00:23:08,478 --> 00:23:10,787
Is something wrong?

206
00:23:11,718 --> 00:23:13,310
No.

207
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:17,192
It's just that
you never talk about him.

208
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:20,196
I'll tell you more when you get older.

209
00:23:20,318 --> 00:23:23,196
Older?
You always say that.

210
00:23:25,318 --> 00:23:26,797
Look.

211
00:23:28,718 --> 00:23:31,278
-I made invitations.
-No, mom.

212
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:34,515
No one has birthday parties anymore.

213
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:38,711
All kids want
to celebrate their birthday.

214
00:23:38,838 --> 00:23:40,556
Are you coming?

215
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:53,958
-Have you seen Modulf or Lise?
-No. Why do you ask?

216
00:23:56,878 --> 00:24:01,110
See? When I'm not there,
they pick on the others.

217
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:04,316
Look!

218
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,956
And there!

219
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:13,196
And again!

220
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:17,395
YOU'RE INVITED
TO MODULF'S SUPER BIRTHDAY!

221
00:24:22,158 --> 00:24:26,595
You get bullied.
That's why you don't hand those out.

222
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:29,835
Because you know
no one will come!

223
00:24:46,438 --> 00:24:48,315
<i>Stop it, guys!</i>

224
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:02,993
Well?

225
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,870
Modulf, wait!

226
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:17,548
I was right, wasn't I?

227
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:22,473
-But I know what we can do.
-About what?

228
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:26,997
-I have a plan.
-What is it?

229
00:25:28,718 --> 00:25:31,278
We're going to make you tough.

230
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:34,310
By Monday,
you're going to be New Modulf.

231
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:38,875
New and tough. Almost as tough
as these superheroes.

232
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,392
No, you have to fight back!

233
00:25:56,798 --> 00:25:58,390
Like this.

234
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:03,951
Get it?

235
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:06,467
You have to overcome your fear.

236
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:52,913
I won!

237
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,107
Come on.

238
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:59,433
Keep it up.
Keep it up.

239
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:02,156
Keep going.

240
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:08,469
Am I ready now?

241
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,108
Yeah, totally ready.

242
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:28,750
Am I ready now?

243
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:32,556
Not quite yet.

244
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:40,154
Good job!

245
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,514
Am I ready now?

246
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:48,875
Not yet.

247
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,596
Good job, Modulf!

248
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:06,751
Come on, Modulf.
You can do it!

249
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,197
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

250
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:18,229
My favorite flavor.

251
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,671
Cheers.

252
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:29,787
It was nice of Hugo and Lise
to invite us to Hunderfossen.

253
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:34,275
Maybe we should celebrate
your birthday here?

254
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:40,394
I forgot to tell you, there's a big
football tournament next weekend.

255
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:46,835
-Then we'll do it the weekend after.
-Sure, maybe.

256
00:28:55,678 --> 00:28:58,829
Don't give up.
You're almost ready.

257
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,597
Yes!

258
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:06,788
Good job!

259
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:15,589
Now I'm ready!

260
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:19,796
No, not yet.

261
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,358
What?
Still not ready?

262
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,836
No, we have to train a little more.

263
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,791
Forget it, I'm done with this!

264
00:30:30,838 --> 00:30:32,510
Wait, Modulf!

265
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:36,153
No, Lise, stop bugging me.
I'm done.

266
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:37,836
That's it!

267
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:41,836
-What?
-The right attitude.

268
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:44,393
Huh?
Attitude?

269
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:50,191
Were you just waiting for me
to give up?

270
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:54,311
Or till you wouldn't
be pushed around anymore.

271
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,157
I'll show you pushing around!

272
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:03,037
You just wait!

273
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:18,153
Don't mess with someone
who knows every trick in the book!

274
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:22,715
I'll rub your hair in the grass
till it turns green!

275
00:31:24,478 --> 00:31:26,434
-Do you give up?
-Yes!

276
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:28,594
Do you give up?

277
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:31,027
Yes!
I give up.

278
00:31:34,878 --> 00:31:38,029
You're pretty strong, for such a wimp.

279
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:40,069
-Oh no!
-What?

280
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:43,587
I've lost my bobby pin.

281
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,149
Now you're ready!

282
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:01,988
Do you remember that?

283
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:05,277
It's at Hunderfossen.
You were five.

284
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,027
That's one of the last things
we did, before...

285
00:32:09,158 --> 00:32:10,716
Before dad died.

286
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:14,276
You know...

287
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:18,316
You resemble him more and more.

288
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,507
He didn't like -

289
00:32:23,478 --> 00:32:27,437
- heights,
or crazy roller coasters.

290
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:32,389
Stop it, mom.

291
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:37,917
It's true.

292
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:42,835
You're lying.
I know that dad was tough and brave.

293
00:33:05,078 --> 00:33:08,468
Remember that aikido
is only for self defense.

294
00:33:08,598 --> 00:33:13,114
-Only use it as a last option.
-I understand.

295
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:17,110
Yay!

296
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:22,669
Just walk right by them
and act perfectly normal.

297
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:44,555
You think you can walk right by us?

298
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:48,387
-What is it?
-Remember what your girlfriend did?

299
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:52,272
We can't just let you
get away with that.

300
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,869
Do we have to drag you
down to the bathroom, or what?

301
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:03,626
-Today you can't touch me!
-Good, Modulf. You tell them.

302
00:34:03,758 --> 00:34:06,067
That isn't up to you!

303
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:11,470
What was that?

304
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:14,871
Yes!

305
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:17,434
You're a freak, Modulf!

306
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:23,113
-You looking for trouble?
-No.

307
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,310
What is this?

308
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,751
I just want you to leave me alone.

309
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,510
Oh no!

310
00:34:37,078 --> 00:34:39,387
What's going on here?

311
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:43,193
He hit me!
And threw Frank to the ground.

312
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:44,797
-No!
-You hit them?

313
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:49,237
-No. I promise. I didn't hit him.
-Are you a hitter?

314
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:57,397
-I was just standing here.
-Are you OK?

315
00:34:57,758 --> 00:35:01,307
-Are you OK, Frank?
-Yes, I think so.

316
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:06,637
You know we don't allow bullying.
We wrote that rule together.

317
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:08,953
But I'm not a bully!

318
00:35:09,078 --> 00:35:12,036
-I didn't hit him!
-Don't lie to me.

319
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:21,474
This better be the last time
you do anything like this, Modulf.

320
00:35:22,198 --> 00:35:23,517
Yes, principal.

321
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:28,994
Shake hands with Jørgen and Frank
and apologize.

322
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:33,109
-Sorry.
-Say it like you mean it!

323
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,510
Sorry, Jørgen.

324
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:38,150
Sorry, Frank.

325
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,595
Hey, guys.
That was awesome!

326
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:51,391
You handled that perfectly!

327
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:55,557
Now the teachers think I'm a bully.

328
00:35:55,678 --> 00:35:59,387
But you did great.
I am so proud of you!

329
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:03,670
-Really?
-Yeah. We just caught a bad break.

330
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:06,756
We need a new plan.

331
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:08,789
This plan is simple.

332
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:13,355
See to it that Frank and Jørgen
bully you right here.

333
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:19,556
I'll be in the stall next door.

334
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,914
I'll film everything.

335
00:36:23,038 --> 00:36:27,350
And we'll send the film
to the principal and the police.

336
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:30,072
That will prove who the bullies are.

337
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:35,154
<i>And best of all,</i>
<i>the bullying will end!</i>

338
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,311
Hi!

339
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:53,351
This is the story
of David and Goliath.

340
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:57,790
Goliath was a giant, so big
not even Jesus dared fight him.

341
00:36:57,918 --> 00:37:01,991
David, on the other hand,
was tiny but smart.

342
00:37:02,118 --> 00:37:03,756
Come in!

343
00:37:04,198 --> 00:37:07,952
Hurry to your seats!
This is exciting.

344
00:37:12,118 --> 00:37:15,633
-Goliath was a giant...
-Quiet down!

345
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:18,397
Anyway, David was...

346
00:37:18,518 --> 00:37:22,147
He was tiny, but smart.
And he was a shepherd.

347
00:37:22,278 --> 00:37:24,792
So he had a slingshot.

348
00:37:24,918 --> 00:37:27,113
When he met Goliath...

349
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:34,308
-What just happened?
-Frank threw something at Modulf.

350
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:35,632
Huh?

351
00:37:35,758 --> 00:37:38,113
Stop that nonsense.
Go ahead.

352
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:42,026
That was the story
of David and Goliath.

353
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:44,433
Excellent!
OK, who's next?

354
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,949
Where's your girlfriend?

355
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:08,310
-I don't know.
-You're like two pods in a pea!

356
00:38:10,798 --> 00:38:13,107
Well, she isn't here.

357
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:17,917
Are you trying to be funny?
This is serious!

358
00:38:18,438 --> 00:38:20,269
I don't know where she is.

359
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:23,955
I said: Where is Lise?

360
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:28,916
Just give me a swirlie
and forget about Lise!

361
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:34,033
-It doesn't work like that, Modulf.
-Where is Lise?

362
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:39,357
Go ahead and give me a swirlie
and stop bothering Lise!

363
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:43,354
This is getting weird, Modulf.

364
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:48,114
Aren't you going to give me a swirlie?

365
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:49,876
Nope.

366
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,789
Stop it, guys!

367
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:05,196
Stop it, guys!

368
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:09,547
What's going on here?

369
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:14,632
We're just three buddies
in the bathroom together.

370
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:18,956
I see.
But your hair is soaking wet, Modulf.

371
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:22,036
I just thought I'd slick it back.

372
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:27,391
Slick back... Boys never worried
about their hair when I was your age.

373
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:30,715
So everything is OK, in other words?

374
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,317
I really need to...

375
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,513
What's all this sawdust?

376
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:57,950
The cleaners must have done
a lousy job this week.

377
00:40:01,118 --> 00:40:05,873
-There's a hole in the wall.
-That's always been there.

378
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:10,076
I saw a red light.

379
00:40:14,838 --> 00:40:17,830
I can see into the stall next door.

380
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:20,309
What the...
Lise?!

381
00:40:51,038 --> 00:40:54,633
Dad won't be happy
when he hears about this.

382
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:58,990
We'll have to meet with the teachers
and everything.

383
00:40:59,118 --> 00:41:03,873
It was a lousy plan. Now those guys
will never leave us alone.

384
00:41:03,998 --> 00:41:08,469
It would have worked if you hadn't
stuck your head in the toilet.

385
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:12,147
Who would do such a thing?
Now we have nothing on them.

386
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:16,027
It wouldn't have worked anyway.
Your plan sucked!

387
00:41:16,158 --> 00:41:20,390
The plan would have worked
if you had stuck to it!

388
00:41:23,278 --> 00:41:25,872
Want to take the detour today?

389
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:29,117
Why?

390
00:41:29,718 --> 00:41:35,429
-No point in asking for trouble.
-Can't you handle resistance?

391
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:37,992
What do you mean?

392
00:41:38,118 --> 00:41:43,829
You're becoming a chicken again.
I refuse to let them pressure me.

393
00:41:44,358 --> 00:41:49,034
Take the detour, chicken.
Pretend nothing has changed.

394
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:52,396
But I refuse.
Goodbye and thank you!

395
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,196
Please, Lise!

396
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:35,991
-Hi, Modulf.
-Hi. Could I have a word with Lise?

397
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:39,872
She isn't home from school yet.
Weren't you together?

398
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:41,716
No, not today.

399
00:42:42,998 --> 00:42:47,594
If you see Lise,
tell her dinner is in the microwave.

400
00:43:08,198 --> 00:43:10,189
What happened to you?

401
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:12,627
What's it look like?

402
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,828
You're bleeding!

403
00:43:15,798 --> 00:43:20,235
Frank and Jørgen
were waiting in the woods, and...

404
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:25,311
Let me help you.

405
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:37,878
Lise, what happened to you?

406
00:43:39,198 --> 00:43:43,476
-I fell on my bike.
-Let me have a look at you.

407
00:43:43,758 --> 00:43:45,157
Ow!

408
00:43:45,278 --> 00:43:47,030
This has gone too far.

409
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:50,594
What has gone too far?

410
00:43:51,678 --> 00:43:56,547
Those people who make
crappy bikes and bike paths.

411
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:01,232
Let me get a first-aid kit.

412
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:06,670
Listen, I'll fix this.
I won't be chicken anymore.

413
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:08,552
Modulf, wait.

414
00:44:09,998 --> 00:44:13,354
Thanks for being such a good friend.

415
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:32,712
Modulf?

416
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:41,110
-You beat up Lise!
-It wasn't just me!

417
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:43,832
Why didn't you beat me up instead?

418
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,028
As long as you're friends,
they want us to go after her too.

419
00:44:49,158 --> 00:44:51,114
Who are "they"?

420
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:54,633
Who are "they"?!

421
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,589
The others.

422
00:44:58,998 --> 00:45:01,307
Sverre and those guys.

423
00:45:04,718 --> 00:45:07,437
You're a freak, Modulf!

424
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:15,153
If I don't bully you,
they'll bully me, like before.

425
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:46,796
It isn't very smart
to hang out with you.

426
00:45:46,918 --> 00:45:50,228
Was it better
when you didn't have to share?

427
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:53,156
Now that
the two of you are together, -

428
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:55,553
- you'll both get beat up.

429
00:45:55,678 --> 00:45:58,795
Maybe you should break up with her.

430
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:02,877
Don't you agree, Frank and Jørgen?

431
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:12,307
So if I stop hanging out with Lise, -

432
00:46:12,438 --> 00:46:14,429
- you'll leave her alone?

433
00:46:15,238 --> 00:46:17,035
Bingo, Einstein.

434
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:19,388
Promise you won't hurt her?

435
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:25,354
If you do everything we say.
And I mean everything.

436
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,630
Check it out!

437
00:46:49,118 --> 00:46:50,517
Look at him!

438
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,236
Good job, Modulf!
You're almost there.

439
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:02,555
What a goof!

440
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:10,713
Modulf!
What do you think you're doing?

441
00:47:12,918 --> 00:47:15,830
What is it with you?

442
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:20,950
You've gone from star pupil to bully.
And now you're a...

443
00:47:21,078 --> 00:47:23,546
Nudist!
This must end now.

444
00:47:29,758 --> 00:47:33,671
What's going on?
Weren't you going to fix things?

445
00:47:33,798 --> 00:47:35,550
Yeah...

446
00:47:46,278 --> 00:47:49,873
I'm sick and tired of you
and your plans!

447
00:47:53,878 --> 00:47:57,951
-I thought we were friends.
-You thought wrong!

448
00:47:58,078 --> 00:47:59,636
Modulf, wait...

449
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,516
Get lost!

450
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:22,913
I'm sorry, Lise.

451
00:48:23,038 --> 00:48:25,427
I had no choice.

452
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:28,550
They would have hurt you.

453
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:52,714
Look at Lise Friendless!

454
00:48:58,158 --> 00:49:01,230
Sorry, Modulf, I didn't see you.

455
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:20,668
Modulf has to do whatever
Frank and Jørgen tell him to do.

456
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:23,756
No matter what?
Poor Modulf.

457
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:28,030
They'll just make him do
worse and worse things.

458
00:49:31,518 --> 00:49:34,988
Happy birthday to you...

459
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:54,750
Happy birthday, my hero.

460
00:49:54,878 --> 00:49:56,550
Blow them out!

461
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,796
Excellent!

462
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:02,636
Here you go.

463
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:15,916
-You can write down your experiences.
-Thank you.

464
00:50:16,038 --> 00:50:19,508
And you can buy something for this.

465
00:50:19,638 --> 00:50:24,871
Too bad your birthday crashed
with that football tournament.

466
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:28,274
But you and I
will make the most of it.

467
00:50:28,398 --> 00:50:32,073
We could call Hugo and Lise.

468
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:35,554
You and Lise are such good friends.

469
00:50:35,678 --> 00:50:38,146
I don't think so...

470
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:43,190
Who can that be?

471
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:46,432
This early in the morning?

472
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:01,076
It's Lise.

473
00:51:01,198 --> 00:51:03,917
She says it's important.

474
00:51:04,038 --> 00:51:06,632
You can't do this, Modulf.

475
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,516
Do what?

476
00:51:09,638 --> 00:51:11,037
Don't you get it?

477
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:16,233
If you go back to the way it was,
nothing will ever change.

478
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:23,313
I don't know what I'm doing here,
since we're no longer friends, but...

479
00:51:23,678 --> 00:51:28,798
But I want to be your friend,
and friends help each other.

480
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:31,591
What are you talking about?

481
00:51:34,198 --> 00:51:36,154
Tove...

482
00:51:36,278 --> 00:51:39,588
Modulf would never tell you himself.

483
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:41,948
So I'll say it for him.

484
00:51:42,878 --> 00:51:44,470
What?

485
00:51:45,278 --> 00:51:47,587
Modulf gets bullied.

486
00:51:48,118 --> 00:51:49,915
And he has for years.

487
00:51:54,118 --> 00:51:59,476
Modulf gets bullied
more than anyone else at school.

488
00:51:59,598 --> 00:52:01,429
Is that true, Modulf?

489
00:52:07,678 --> 00:52:10,670
I'm sorry.
I wanted to be your friend.

490
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:16,027
Lise, you can leave now.
Friends don't betray each other.

491
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:21,675
You know everything
about betraying friends!

492
00:52:29,998 --> 00:52:32,307
Why didn't you tell me?

493
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:38,111
Does this have
anything to do with your father?

494
00:52:48,038 --> 00:52:51,951
I know that you think
your father was a hero.

495
00:52:52,718 --> 00:52:55,915
But I just wanted to protect you.

496
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:59,954
Don't you remember what he was like?

497
00:53:00,078 --> 00:53:02,911
That he was sad all the time?

498
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:04,949
What do you mean?

499
00:53:08,238 --> 00:53:09,956
Your father...

500
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:14,073
He got picked on his entire life.

501
00:53:14,198 --> 00:53:16,758
At school and at work.

502
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:20,075
And he was never able to fight back.

503
00:53:22,438 --> 00:53:23,871
Eventually...

504
00:53:26,518 --> 00:53:29,430
He couldn't take any more.

505
00:53:32,438 --> 00:53:35,111
-You're lying!
-Modulf...

506
00:54:44,918 --> 00:54:47,273
I don't want to become like dad.

507
00:54:47,398 --> 00:54:50,629
I don't want to be sad all the time.

508
00:54:59,398 --> 00:55:02,834
-Can you take this for me?
-What is it?

509
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,866
I've kept count of the days
since dad died. Days I've missed him.

510
00:55:23,558 --> 00:55:27,028
One star for every day that's gone by.

511
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,797
-Jørgen, I need you to do me a favor.
-What?

512
00:55:55,918 --> 00:56:00,514
Bring Frank, Sverre and the gang
to the junk yard.

513
00:56:00,638 --> 00:56:02,356
OK.

514
00:56:03,558 --> 00:56:05,355
What's up?

515
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:12,276
OK.

516
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:14,866
Modulf wants to meet us.

517
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:29,195
Hello?

518
00:57:22,478 --> 00:57:24,355
What's so important?

519
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:28,437
Who do you think you are?
Super-Dumbulf?

520
00:57:42,558 --> 00:57:48,030
I invited you here to let you know
that it's over. No more bullying.

521
00:57:48,158 --> 00:57:50,433
And if we disagree?

522
00:57:50,558 --> 00:57:53,197
Then I'll have to force you.

523
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:05,709
Modulf?

524
00:58:39,998 --> 00:58:45,072
Ever since second grade I've thought
I was a hero. A superhero.

525
00:59:03,078 --> 00:59:08,630
I saved everyone here from
being bullied by Frank and Jørgen.

526
00:59:13,638 --> 00:59:16,357
I saved every one of you.

527
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:19,436
I saved you and you and you.

528
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:23,036
But...

529
00:59:23,638 --> 00:59:26,152
But lately I have realized -

530
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:30,032
- that no one deserves to be bullied,
no matter what.

531
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:31,750
I'm no superhero.

532
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:37,997
Everyone here knows
I was bullied by Frank and Jørgen.

533
00:59:39,238 --> 00:59:41,468
I thought they were tough.

534
00:59:41,598 --> 00:59:46,114
But they bully
to avoid being bullied themselves.

535
00:59:46,238 --> 00:59:49,310
By Ali, Arne and Sverre.

536
00:59:51,318 --> 00:59:56,073
They're the ones who make
Frank and Jørgen pick on me.

537
00:59:57,398 --> 01:00:01,107
You're the leader
of the gang, aren't you?

538
01:00:02,958 --> 01:00:08,590
You decide if I should be beaten,
swirlied or hung from a tree.

539
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:16,191
We played together in kindergarten,
Sverre. We were friends.

540
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:19,432
We were all friends.

541
01:00:23,158 --> 01:00:26,434
Why can't it still be like that?

542
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,952
Everyone should be friends.

543
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:03,711
You'll always be a loser, Dumbulf!

544
01:01:13,678 --> 01:01:15,396
Modulf!
Modulf!

545
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:20,994
That was about time!

546
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,708
Look out!
Behind you!

547
01:01:54,638 --> 01:01:56,276
Modulf!

548
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:02,267
Modulf, wake up!

549
01:02:07,038 --> 01:02:09,632
I'm sorry!
I didn't mean it!

550
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,430
Modulf!

551
01:02:14,078 --> 01:02:16,353
Modulf!
Modulf!

552
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:45,586
Thank you.

553
01:02:47,678 --> 01:02:51,148
You may no longer
want to be my friend.

554
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:54,991
But don't ever say
that I let you down.

555
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,632
I have always done
what's best for you.

556
01:02:57,758 --> 01:03:02,195
Even after you pushed me away.
I have always supported you.

557
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:06,830
But when I needed a friend,
after those idiots beat me, -

558
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:10,398
- you weren't there, Modulf.

559
01:03:10,518 --> 01:03:13,874
I never want to be your friend again!

560
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:17,115
And I didn't come here
because of you.

561
01:03:17,238 --> 01:03:20,275
I came to find my bobby pin.

562
01:03:25,078 --> 01:03:28,957
You can go to hell,
as far as I'm concerned!

563
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:11,990
-Wow, you are tough!
-To say what you said...

564
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:15,436
Thank you.

565
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:21,115
Way to go, Modulf!

566
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,637
Good job!

567
01:04:40,638 --> 01:04:42,913
Good job, Super-Modulf!

568
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:58,189
This is for you.

569
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:13,549
Do you think many will come?

570
01:05:14,558 --> 01:05:16,708
I don't know.
I doubt it.

571
01:05:18,118 --> 01:05:20,074
Are many invited?

572
01:05:21,078 --> 01:05:22,670
Only one.

573
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:31,826
Someone who was a real hero for me,
when I needed it most.

574
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:35,917
Even though
I couldn't be the same for her.

575
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:42,713
We need to get to class.

576
01:05:49,398 --> 01:05:51,787
OFFICE

577
01:05:53,758 --> 01:05:55,476
Watch out!

578
01:06:05,718 --> 01:06:07,834
He'll like that spot.

579
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:22,827
<i>Hi</i>.
<i>My name is Modulf</i>.

580
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:26,951
<i>That's Norse for "wolf" and "wrath"</i>.

581
01:06:27,078 --> 01:06:30,388
<i>But I'm not as dangerous as I sound</i>.

582
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:38,036
<i>I used to think</i>
<i>that I was helping everyone else</i>.

583
01:06:38,638 --> 01:06:42,551
<i>But I was the one</i>
<i>that needed help the most</i>.

584
01:06:43,278 --> 01:06:48,796
<i>I just didn't realize it until</i>
<i>a real hero came to my rescue</i>.

585
01:06:57,598 --> 01:07:00,795
-Hello!
-Hi! Great that you could come.

586
01:07:06,878 --> 01:07:08,914
Not bad, for a wimp.

587
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:18,314
Are you ready?

588
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,909
One, two, jump!

589
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:42,037
THE TOUGH GUYS
