BASED ON THE NOVEL
I MET LOH KIWAN BY CHO HAE-JIN

2
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,458
[footsteps approaching]

3
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,625
[melancholy music playing]

4
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,583
[sighs]

5
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,291
[music fades]

6
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:05,333
When we land, walk out separately.
Don't crowd together.

7
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:09,916
Once in customs, you'll see a checkpoint.
That's where you'll give your passport.

8
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,500
Try not to act nervous.
Do what they tell you.

9
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,083
But, sir, what if they question all of us?

10
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,541
"I don't speak French, sorry."
That's all you'll have to say.

11
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,541
We're preparing to land.
For your safety, sit down, please.

12
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes, ma'am.

13
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,500
Once you're off the plane, go to gate 3.
We'll meet by the bathrooms.

14
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,125
"I don't speak French."

15
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,809
- [man 1] Wait, so what do I do, then?
- I don't speak French.

16
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,583
[man 2] Memorize it.
You could get caught otherwise.

17
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,336
- [man 3] What do we do if we get caught?
<i>- This is your captain speaking.</i>

18
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,291
<i>We have begun our descent
into Brussels Airport.</i>

19
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,375
[indistinct chattering]

20
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:54,625
[agent 1] Next.

21
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,291
"I don't..."

22
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,500
[agent 2] Please have
your passports ready. Thank you.

23
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,083
[door lock clicks]

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,666
[man 1] Jeon Chun-bong.

25
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,458
Lee Han-gil.

26
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,708
Park Dong-hun.

27
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:44,958
Kim Jeong-sik.

28
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,333
Lee Gwang-cheol.

29
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:59,208
Um, excuse me, comrade.
Where is this place?

30
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,208
I'll drive you. Forty bucks.

31
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,125
I'll pay you when we get there.

32
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,375
[chuckles]

33
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,833
[pensive music playing]

34
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,208
Here's the money.

35
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:58,125
I don't know what your story is,
but I don't want any bad luck. Take it.

36
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,333
[taps door]

37
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,583
Call me if you wanna go back to China.

38
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,666
Here's my card.

39
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:23,833
Go.

40
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,208
[employee 1] Please
don't push each other around.

41
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,416
Please stay in the line.

42
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,583
You can't stand there.
Go to the other side.

43
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,708
Come on through.

44
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,791
[employee 2] Next.

45
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:57,083
[female employee] Move on, please.
Move on.

46
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,625
Please fill out this form.

47
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,958
[in French] Next.

48
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,666
You must attach a copy of your ID.

49
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,833
An ID.

50
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,000
Um, passport, please.

51
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:38,250
A copy of the passport
or another form of ID you have to attach.

52
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,041
Do you... Okay.

53
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,916
Please get some help
from the interpreter, okay?

54
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:46,875
Mm-hmm.

55
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,125
Yes. Mm-hmm.

56
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,208
You. Help.

57
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,750
[in English] Mr. Loh Kiwan?

58
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,791
Hello there.
I'm your interpreter, Kim Gyeong-sil.

59
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,875
Oh.

60
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,166
You're in luck today.
You usually have to book in advance.

61
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,583
I'm really glad to help you out.
Shall we go?

62
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,250
[indistinct chattering]

63
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,767
- [examiner in French] Hello. How are you?
- [Gyeong-sil] Hello.

64
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,666
[examiner speaking French]

65
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:31,208
[in English] "First thing we need to do
is gather some personal information."

66
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:35,125
"Your name, your date of birth,
country of origin, and hometown."

67
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,583
My name is Loh Kiwan.

68
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,250
[speaking French]

69
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,666
[in English] I was born
December 1st, um, 1990.

70
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:52,708
Camp 7, Hasang Collective Farm, Usi-gun,
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

71
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,083
I was born
in the farm's seventh work unit.

72
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:02,166
I was able to obtain a passport
through a broker my uncle found.

73
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,791
[speaking French]

74
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,583
[speaking French]

75
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:15,208
[Gyeong-sil in English] "So, Mr. Loh,
you say that you fled to China in 2019

76
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,083
but that you weren't employed
while you were living in Yanji."

77
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,000
"How were you able
to afford a plane ticket here to Belgium

78
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,666
and counterfeit a passport?"

79
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,250
Well, uh...

80
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,375
Well, my mother... she...

81
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,000
[speaking French]

82
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,208
[examiner speaking French]

83
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,511
[Gyeong-sil in English]" Do you mean
your mother gave you the money?"

84
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,583
[slurping]

85
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,666
[slurping]

86
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,916
Mom, why aren't you eating?

87
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,833
I'm not hungry.

88
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,333
Anyway, it brings good luck
when you eat a birthday meal alone.

89
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
They say if you do that,

90
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,416
you'll go through your entire life
without ever starving.

91
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:12,500
They say you should eat your noodles whole
if you want to live longer,

92
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,500
so stop breaking your noodles apart, okay?

93
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,916
All right, okay.

94
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,666
- [Kiwan spits, coughs]
- [chuckles]

95
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,041
[Kiwan moaning]

96
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,583
Oh, Mom... do you work today?

97
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,291
You know people like to have
warm food on cold days.

98
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,958
That also means more money for you and me.

99
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,125
I know, but I should be the one working.

100
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:48,708
You do so much for us...
while I spend my days indoors.

101
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:49,916
It's so unfair.

102
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Now, now. It's your birthday,
and I don't mind working.

103
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,291
Besides, all a mother wants is
for her child to be safe and healthy.

104
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,583
I can continue to work for us
until we leave China.

105
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,625
So don't worry.

106
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,666
It's my fault.

107
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,125
I should've turned a blind eye
when the boss was beating up Jeong-jin.

108
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,041
Otherwise, I wouldn't have to be
in hiding like this.

109
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,916
- I'm sorry, Mother.
- Now, don't talk like that.

110
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
He would have died
if you didn't intervene.

111
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,041
You did the right thing,
so never apologize for that.

112
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,625
All right, okay.

113
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,791
Don't stay past closing, hmm?

114
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,083
I would leave on time
if it was up to me, but it's not.

115
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,083
[Kiwan sighs]

116
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,250
I'll see you after work.

117
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,333
Happy birthday, comrade.

118
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,416
[wistful music playing]

119
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,208
[patron 1] Miss!

120
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,291
Yes?

121
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,000
- What would you like?
- A cold one.

122
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,166
Coming right up.

123
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,476
- Hey, that snow sure is wild.
- [patron 2] Hey, comrade!

124
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,726
- You're here!
- [patron 2] Yeah!

125
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,750
[wistful music continues]

126
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,458
[sighs]

127
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,125
[door opens]

128
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,833
[Gyeong-sil] Mr. Loh?
This is the last question for today.

129
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:02,500
[speaking French]

130
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,423
[Gyeong-sil in English]
"Are you Korean-Chinese

131
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,916
and just pretending
that you are North Korean

132
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
to receive state subsidies
set aside for defectors?"

133
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:11,791
Uh,

134
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,750
I am not.

135
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,833
[Gyeong-sil] No.

136
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:22,250
There will be a second interview.
I can fit you in on February 5th.

137
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,416
At three o'clock. I'll jot you down.

138
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,416
I guess I'll see you then.

139
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,166
Um, wait...

140
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,583
You mean February... of next year?
Is that what I'm hearing?

141
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,666
[Gyeong-sil] Mmm.

142
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,000
It's just... what am I supposed to do?
I won't be able to work for now?

143
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,208
You'll just have to hang in there.

144
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
[wistful music playing]

145
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,208

[music fades]

147
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,123
[man 1] Where did you say
that restaurant was again?

148
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,291
[man 2] Oh, just have to go downstairs.
It's on the left.

149
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,375
[man 1] Ah!

150
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,083

[door opens, closes]

156
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,916
[man] Oh God, baby,
you taste like watermelon.

157
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,041
[woman moans] Come up here.
I wanna taste too.

158
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,250
[man] You will. I'm not done with you yet.

159
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,666
- [woman laughs] Yeah, right there.
- [man moans]

163
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,208
{\an8}[man] Oh yeah.

164
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,541
Oh, hey there, sexy. You wanna join us?

165
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,750
[man] Hey, get out of here!
I said, get out of here, huh?

166
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,458
[man laughs]

167
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,250
[man grunts] Get out of here!

168

- [man laughs]
- [woman] Don't kick him out so soon!

169
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:42,250
I wanna taste of him.

Hey! Let me in!

I have no idea.

330

Listen, comrade. I know, uh... you took it.

So please give it back to me, huh?

332

Did you?

334
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,250
I did. Why?

335
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,125
What else
was I supposed to do with it, hmm?

Huh?

Uncle?

355
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:21,208
Listen, your mother wanted this.

356
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:24,708
I showed her the money
so she knew how much her life was worth.

357
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,416
She agreed to this.

358
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,625
It was... her final gift.

359
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,166
[both grunt]

360
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,083
- Let go of me, Uncle.
- Kiwan, don't.

361
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,083
Stop! Let go!

362
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,750
[both grunting]

363
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,791
Let go! Let me die!

364
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,041
[grunts]

365
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,250
Leave me alone!

366
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:05,041
Give it here! Let me die!

367
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,125
Uncle, let go of me.

368
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,041
Stop.

369
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,375
What are you doing?

370
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,750
Get a grip, Kiwan.

371
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,208
Your mother wanted you to survive!

372
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,333
You can't die, you hear?

373
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,125
Do it for your mother's sake, okay?

374
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:24,958
[screams] Do you hear me?

375
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:27,041
[wistful music playing]

376
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:31,208
[sobs] Don't let
your... mother's death be in vain.

377
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,375
You need to get out of here.

378
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Get on that plane and never look back!

379
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,500
Promise me you will!

380
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,875
Promise me! [sobs]

381
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,750
I need to know that you'll be okay, Kiwan.

382
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,875
Tell me you understand!

383
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:53,958
[crying] Kiwan.

384
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,458
Kiwan. [sobs]

385
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,125
[sobs]

386
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,208
[crying]

387
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,500
I'm sorry.

388
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,541
Mom, I'm sorry.

389
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,625
[crying]

390
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:51,416
Mom! Mom!

391
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:54,708
[crying]

392
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,583
[water running]

393
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:02,125
[water stops]

394
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,375
[sighs]

395
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,000
You want your wallet?

396
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,500
I need your help.

397
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,250
Tell them that I stole... only 30 bucks,
and you can have your wallet back.

398
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,750
You really are shameless, aren't you?

399
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:37,875
You want me to lie for you
after what you did?

400
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,083
I've got a record.

401
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,333
I won't get locked up for just 30 bucks.

402
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:45,375
A thief should go to jail.
It's exactly where you belong.

403
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:50,250
I can't get your wallet if I'm locked up.

404
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,583
Just help me.

405
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,291
[officer in French] I'm hoping
you can help confirm his identity

406
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,000
and the exact amount stolen.

407
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,125
Okay.

408
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,416
All right.

409
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,750
Just a moment. I'll put him on.

410
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,435
[in English] Good afternoon to you too.

411
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,958
Loh Kiwan is my name, yes.

412
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,750
Yes.

413
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,041
It was American dollars.

414
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,708
About $30. Thank you.

415
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,750
Yes.

416
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,125
[officer in French] Thank you.

417
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:42,688
[man in English] We'll make it quick.

418
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,750
[Marie sighs]

419
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:44,833
[Kiwan] Let's go.

420
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:47,916
Just go home and wait.
I'll get it for you later.

421
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,416
I don't have a home to go to.
So let's go now.

422
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,041
Well, give me your number,
and I'll grab it for you tomorrow.

423
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:57,083
[scoffs] You think I'd trust a thief?
I want my wallet back.

424
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,708
We'll go together.

425
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,208
Marie. Marie!

426
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,833
Uh, sir, wait a minute.
Sorry, I'm Marie's father. Can we speak?

427
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,291
I heard you're from North Korea.

428
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,666
This is for you.
It's not much, I'm afraid.

429
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,491
- It's just... Don't make a scene.
- What are you doing?

430
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,333
I'm just trying to help you here.

431
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,113
It's only a small amount, but...

432
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,375
- Stop!
- Stop, Marie.

433
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:35,958
[Marie sighs]

434
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,333
- Stop acting like you're a good person!
- Can't we talk for a moment?

435
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:41,541
[Marie grunts]

436
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,083
I've got nothing to say to you.

437
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:46,708
Seriously.

438
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,166
Are you coming or not?

439
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,083
Hey, just wait here.

440
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,666
Oh, that's a good one.
You know I don't trust you.

441
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,291
- I'm coming too.
- Stay here! Do as I say.

442
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,166
[Marie sighs]

443
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,166
- Give me ten minutes.
- [Kiwan grunts]

444
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,041
[unsettling music playing]

445
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,333
[man 1] Please give me a bit more time.

446
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:34,208
- [man 1 gasps]
- [man 2] Goddamn it!

447
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,666
I told you not to move.

448
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:38,791
Don't knock over the apple.

449
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, Marie, you're here.
Hey, riddle me this.

450
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,583
How do I avoid shooting
the journalist in the head?

451
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,541
[journalist whimpers]
Please just give me more time.

452
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:53,166
[man 2] Is there a problem with my stance?
What do you think?

453
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:55,250
You aim too long.

454
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,041
Shoot within three seconds of aiming.
Don't hesitate.

455
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,333
- [journalist breathes nervously]
- Is that right?

456
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:05,625
[panting nervously]

457
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:09,041
- [crossbow fires]
- [screaming in pain]

458
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,291
- [journalist whimpers]
- This isn't my specialty.

459
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,958
I only set the targets.

460
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,750
But you shoot them.

461
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
[sighs]

462
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:22,500
[journalist screaming]

463
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:30,125
Remember the wallet I gave you yesterday?
Well, I need it back.

464
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,458
Marie, you're terribly predictable.

465
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:35,750
It's almost cute.

466
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,106
- Don't touch me!
- [thug 1] Shut up!

467
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:52,666
[man 2] Give us a moment.

468
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,625
I expected this.

469
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,125
You stole it, didn't you?

470
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,958
[sighs] It's none of your business.

471
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:08,416
Don't steal money to pay me back.

472
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,958
Work for me until your debt is paid.

473
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,083
I told you I quit.

474
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,416
I think that's my decision.

475
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:24,958
Next Wednesday, two-on-two with the Dutch.
Win and I'll give you this money back.

476
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
And the wallet.

477
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,416
Tell them I shoot from 25 meters.

478
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:39,166
They're gonna ask for 50,
but say no, okay?

479
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:40,916
Okay.

480
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,500
[Marie] Let's get outta here.

481
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,416
[Kiwan] Hey, wait. Where's my wallet?

482
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,916
I'll get it next week.
You have to wait longer.

483
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,750
Is this all a big joke?
You're lying to me again, aren't you?

484
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:03,333
I'm not lying, all right?

485
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,666
[pants] Your wallet's with a friend.

486
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:09,708
[Kiwan] Shit.

487
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,208
[Marie] Hey!

488
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,250
[unsettling music playing]

489
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,916
[thug 1] Last round.
We've gotta get to work soon.

490
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
[thug 2] All right, next round.

491
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,105
[thug 1] You know those guys.
They're all about money. [laughs]

492
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,208
[thug 2] Like you, right? [chuckles]

493
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,416
[thug 1] Ah, shut up.

494
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:31,833
- [thug 2] What the hell?
- [thug 3] What's his deal?

495
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,375
I want my wallet.

496
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:36,333
- Give me my wallet!
- [thug 3] Fuck off.

497
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:40,416
- Hey, get up. Come on, let's go.
- [thug 1] Aren't they just two of a kind?

498
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,125
What's going on?
What's with all the noise?

499
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,250
Why are you still here?

500
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,750
Oh, I see.

501
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:54,375
So you're the "friend" she mentioned, huh?

502
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,583
Stay right there.

503
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,166
You and I need to talk.

504
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,708
Let me go! Let go! Stop it! [grunts]

505
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,333
[groans]

506
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,458
- [Kiwan] Shit!
- Kiwan.

507
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:14,166
If we don't leave, they'll kill you.
This won't solve anything.

508
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,500
Let go of me!

509
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,125
You can trust me. I promise.

510
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,666
I'll get your wallet. I swear I'll get it.

511
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,541
[breathing heavily]

512
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,416
[tuts]

513
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,958
[music fades]

514
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,250
[Marie] Come over here.

515
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,375
You have to remember
that you're in a foreign country,

516
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:13,500
so you better keep that temper of yours
in check. Got it?

517
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,250
Yeah, well, you're one to talk.

518
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:22,708
[door opens]

519
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:33,583
[lighter clicks]

520
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,250
[Kiwan] When did you come to Belgium?

521
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:40,625
When I was young.

522
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,083
When did she pass away?

523
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,166
Your ma.

524
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,916
The 2nd of last December.

525
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,125
2:15 in the morning.

526
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,583
So you must feel lonely this time of year.

527
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,416
My mom also died in the winter.

528
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,000
Have you found any work here?

529
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:15,833
I recycle bottles for money.

530
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,583
I make just enough not to die.

531
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:23,750
I know it's not too fancy,
but at least I don't steal.

532
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:24,958
Okay, trash king.

533
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:29,125
No one's going to give me any work.
I don't exist here.

534
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,625
ILSIM EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

535
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,875
Hey. Call here.

536
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:49,958
The boss there is a Korean guy.
Say Lee Youn-sung sent you.

537
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,291
Lee Youn-sung?

538
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,958
Yeah, the man outside the station today.

539
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,250
Oh. Do you mean your father?

540
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:02,583
Why can't I say you sent me?
Why must it be your father?

541
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,416
Well, do whatever you want.
I'm nobody though.

542
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,583
[wistful music playing]

543
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,791
Hey, I was just thinking.

544
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,750
I'm worried
that I'll embarrass your father.

545
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:28,750
My clothes are gross... and I smell.

546
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,666
I'm not presentable.

547
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:35,791
[shower water running]

548
00:45:42,916 --> 00:45:44,250
[Marie] Change into these.

549
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:48,791
[wistful music continues]

550
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,750
Well now. This is different.

551
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:12,875
So when should I bring
these back to you, then?

552
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:16,583
[Marie] Just keep them.
They don't belong to anyone.

553
00:46:18,416 --> 00:46:20,166
I have more in there. Want them?

554
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,583
No. It's okay. I'm good.

555
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,875
Whoever hurt your lip,
you should stay far away from him.

556
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,416
You deserve better than that.

557
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,333
Hurting a woman's face is disgraceful.

558
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,416
Any man who'll do that once
is sure to do it again.

559
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Oh.

560
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,625
You made me a promise. Don't forget.

561
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,541
CHOI RYUK-MYUNG, MALE
DOB: DEC. 1, 1990, HEALTHY

562
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,833
Ch... Choi Ryuk-myung?

563
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,250
Yeah.

564
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,333
That's your name now. You're a new man.

565
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,375
It can be complicated
to find work for North Koreans.

566
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:28,750
So when we're there, we'll tell everyone
that you're Chinese-Korean.

567
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,083
Ah, of course.

568
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,333
Thank you so much, comrade.

569
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,750
[laughs] Don't mention it.

570
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,190
[woman] Did the money I sent come through?
It's been two days.

571
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,708
[indistinct chattering]

572
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:03,500
Hey!

573
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,458
[woman] Hey, I've gotta go.

574
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:08,666
If you have any trouble,
Seon-ju will help you out.

575
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,125
- She's actually Chinese-Korean.
- Thank you.

576
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:14,458
[man 1] Take good care of him, Seon-ju.

577
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,281
[man 2] All right. Let's go in.

578
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,333
[machinery whirring]

579
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,458
Who brought that idiot here? Seriously.

580
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:10,416
[door lock clanks]

581
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,625
[grunts]

582
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:27,125
Hey, comrades! I'm trapped in here!

583
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,583
Please open the door!

584
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,416
Comrades! I'm sealed in here!

585
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,833
Comrades, help! Someone please let me out!

586
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,250
If you press this button,
the door will open from the inside.

587
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,375
The green button. Do you understand?

588
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,666
Yes.

589
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,416
- I was right, so pay up.
- I was so close.

590
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,875
[employee 1] You owe me, dog.

591
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,916
Beat it! Go to work!

592
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,625
- Go to work!
- [employee 2] Sure, Mom.

593
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:15,916
- What the fuck did she say? Walk away.
- Hey, man, just calm down. Get a grip.

594
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,750
Those bastards all decided to place bets
on how long you'd be stuck in the freezer.

595
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:21,791
- Huh.
- They like to play tricks on the newbies.

596
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,083
But just ignore them.

597
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:25,166
Go and do the rest now.

598
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,291
Okay.

599
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:39,333
[train horn blares]

600
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,250
[wistful music playing]

601
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,750
[button clicks]

602
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,083
[Seon-ju] Damn, those guys at work
sure are infuriating. They're assholes.

603
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:32,708
They do that to every newbie.
Trap them in that freezer as a sick joke.

604
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,625
It's not personal, just so you know.

605
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,583
What's wrong? Is the meat
not good enough for you, or what?

606
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:46,041
Why would someone with a job steal food?

607
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,640
That meat doesn't belong to either of us.

608
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:55,291
Listen, this shoebox apartment
is 200 a month,

609
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:56,975
and the bus is 50 bucks or more a month.

610
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:59,476
My money's completely gone
by the time I need to buy any food.

611
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,166
So, in my eyes, this is what's fair.

612
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,250
You know how they pat us down
when we all head home?

613
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,958
Well, it turns out they wouldn't dare
pat down a woman's chest.

614
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,666
So it'd be dumb of me not to steal.
That's how I see it.

615
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:17,958
[slurps]

616
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:19,916
[Seon-ju sighs]

617
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:27,083
I do it all for them.
My kids are my whole world.

618
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:29,666
The one in the middle
looks so mischievous.

619
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:34,125
He looks like a general.
So military with his shaved head.

620
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:35,708
That's my daughter.

621
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,275
She's needed brain surgeries,
so we've had to shave her head.

622
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:41,458
- Ah...
- It's no big deal, hmm?

623
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:43,833
The poor kid still has
one more surgery though.

624
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,916
Afterwards, I'll be able to braid her hair
and send her off to school.

625
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, uh, she's very brave.

626
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,333
Thank you. I think I'm pretty full.
The rest of it's yours.

627
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,000
Comrade, eat more meat.

628
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
You have it.

629
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,916
Actually, I'm sick of meat.

630
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,708
The smell gets to me
since we're surrounded by it all day.

631
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:11,125
[tuts]

632
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,500
And stop saying comrades.
Don't you wanna blend in?

633
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:16,541
If you keep saying comrades,
everyone will know you're not from here.

634
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:19,000
[sighs]

635

- [Kiwan coughing]
- [tenant] Who's got time for love? Not me.

638
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,541
I see the same guy every night.

639
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:38,041
Look, there he is, catching the bus!

640
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:39,958
That's the guy I was telling you about.

641
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:42,250
[Kiwan coughs]

642
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,833
[tenant] Let's get away this weekend.
Wanna meet up?

643
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,041
[pensive music playing]

644
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:54,666
[woman] Well, I really want to,
so let's go later.

645
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,500
[man] Ah. Yeah, he's a simp.

646
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:00,458
[indistinct chattering]

647
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:08,125
[host] Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for today's main event.

648
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:11,000
The women's target shooting spectacular
is about to begin,

649
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,666
so please grab your drinks
and find your seats!

650
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,333
[crowd cheering]

651
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:18,041
First up is
the international sensation herself,

652
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:20,208
hailing all the way from the Netherlands,

653
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,125
Julia!

654
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,916
[crowd cheering]

655
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,833
Tonight, she's facing off against
the pride of Belgium,

656
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,958
our very own Marie!

657
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,000
[crowd cheering]

658
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,291
Each player will take one practice shot

659
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,583
before we begin
the first match of the set.

660
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:38,000
You have one minute until betting closes.

661
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:41,041
So hurry up, everyone,
and make your choice!

[music fades]

669
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,458
Marie, what is it?

670
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:45,166
[Marie] What is this?

671
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,583
- Were you never planning to tell me?
- Just give it here.

672
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:51,958
You killed her?

673
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:53,916
Euthanasia?

674
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:56,250
So Mom didn't just die, then.

675
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:58,166
[breathing shakily]

676
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,142
- You were the one who killed her.
- I can explain everything, Marie.

677
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,833
Just listen to me for once, hmm?

678
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,630
- It's not what you think
- Why did you lie to me?

679
00:56:07,166 --> 00:56:09,416
[Marie breathing heavily]

680
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,541
- Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
- Your mom wanted this.

681
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:17,706
She knew you wouldn't have
been able to handle this.

682
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,333
Don't you dare put this on her!
You know that's not it, huh?

683
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:24,166
You knew that I wouldn't let her
go through with it.

684
00:56:25,166 --> 00:56:26,583
So you did it while I was training.

685
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:29,375
Marie, listen. It wasn't like that.
I promise, okay?

686
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:30,666
It wasn't like that.

687
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,791
Just let me explain.

688
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,000
[Youn-sung sighs]

689
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:37,000
[host] Don't panic, ladies and gentlemen.

690
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:40,083
In the meantime,
here's some info for tonight's drawing.

691
00:56:40,166 --> 00:56:42,500
You each should have a ticket.
Turn them over.

692
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:45,583
- You should see a number there, right?
- Give me five minutes.

693
00:56:46,166 --> 00:56:47,916
I haven't done this in a while.

694
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,142
[host] After tonight's game,
we'll do a raffle drawing.

695
00:56:50,166 --> 00:56:52,000
I hope you're all excited.

696
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:54,708
Who's ready to see
some more grade-A shooting?

697
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,458
You're trembling like a terrified puppy.

[beep]

701
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,309
[host] All right, folks,
that was the end of the fourth match.

702
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:37,375
It's now time to wait
as the scores are tallied.

703
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:39,125
Will we have a winner now,

704
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,625
or will we continue on to a fifth round?

705
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,083
Without further delay,
let's now reveal Marie's results.

706
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,500
- [crowd cheering]
- [host] Forty-eight points!

707
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:49,791
It's a tie!

708
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,291
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

709
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,625
Here you go.

710
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:56,041
[host] Four!

711
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,125
Three!

712
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,625
Two! One!

713
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:02,041
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
Betting is now closed.

714
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:03,500
- Here we go!

00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:12,791
- [ding]
- [crowd cheering]

717
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:18,750
[host] Now Marie.
Will she break under pressure?

718
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,500
Or will she shoot her way to victory?

719
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:23,125
Let us see!

720
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,583
- [beep]
- [host] All right!

721
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,958
- And now let's see her final score!
- [ding]

722
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,583
10.4! What an incredible finish, my God!

723
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,750
By two tenths of a point,
Marie is the winner!

724
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:00,083
She had her eye on the prize!

725
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,375
Make some noise for Marie!

726
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:08,541
[crowd chanting] Marie! Marie! Marie!
Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie! Marie!

727
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,250
Fuck yeah!

728
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,083
[laughing]

729
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,375
Didn't I tell ya you'd win?

730
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:20,750
[sighs]

731
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:24,250
Did you see the look on Gerd's face?
I think he fell in love with you.

732
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:25,708
[laughs]

733
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:27,916
He said he won't pull out his investment.

734
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:30,833
- [Marie sighs]
- You should see him before you go.

735
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:32,833
I've got somewhere to be.

736
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:36,083
Are you kidding? Hmm.

737
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:38,416
I've been trying
to get him here for years.

738
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:41,375
We need him to help expand our business.

739
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,458
[Marie sighs]

740
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,541
Listen, I won. Just give me the wallet.

741
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:54,125
[sighs]

742
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,166
[sentimental music playing]

743
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,250
I should go.

744
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,041
[Marie sighs, sniffles]

745
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,958
[Kiwan panting]

746
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:17,041
Eat with me.

747
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,500
Have you eaten yet?

748
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,333
[Seon-ju] What?

749
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:25,833
Can I please borrow some of your meat?

750
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:28,250
- Are you sure? I stole it.
- [Kiwan] Yes, yes, thank you.

751
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
[Kiwan grunts]

752
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,333
- Thank you. You're kind, comrade.
- [Seon-ju] Mm-hmm.

753
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,666
[sizzling]

754
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,666
[Kiwan] Comrade, comrade.

755
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:11,833
Do you need something else?

756
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:12,916
Any lettuce?

757
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:23,166
[slurps]

758
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:28,083
[knocking at door]

759
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:35,875
Utensils.

760
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,000
Ah...

761
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:39,875
I brought you some bowls, too,
just in case.

762
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:42,416
- Uh...
- Just don't forget to wash it all, okay?

763
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:44,083
Thank you, comrade.

764
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:15,291
[Kiwan] Why are you standing? Sit down.

765
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,875
Eat it while it's hot.
I know it's not much.

766
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:26,208
Did you buy all this?
Where'd you get the money?

767
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,250
I didn't have to buy it. It was all free.

768
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,583
Huh?

769
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:36,041
It's not from the trash, so don't worry.

770
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:40,708
Early in the morning, by North Station,
they give us free food.

771
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,666
I go by every day
and pick the things I want.

772
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:46,583
[soup pouring]

773
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:54,750

[tender music playing]

776
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,333
[Marie] I'll get going.

777
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:54,083
All right.

778
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,916
[Marie sighs]

779
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,333
Don't walk me out.

780
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,583
I want to. It's dark outside.

781
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:07,083
[kettle banging]

782
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:10,125
- [tenant] Tea? Who wants some tea?
- Huh? What's going on?

783
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,541
Wow, it's 9:00 already?

784
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:15,875
My neighbor offers tea at night.
He does this every night around 9:00.

785
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,625
- [tenant] Tea! Anyone want tea?
- Let's have some. I'll leave after.

786
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,083
[Kiwan] No, wait, hold on.
Don't. Don't go quite yet.

787
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:25,416
- [kettle banging]
- [tenant] Tea, everyone! Nice and hot!

788
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,333
I'm not allowed to have guests.
He can't know that you're here.

789
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,000
We'll have to wait.

790
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,833
[Seon-ju] Okay, okay, that's enough.

791
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,666
[tenant] Careful now, it's hot.

792
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,166
[kettle banging continues]

793
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,083
[Kiwan] Quiet.

794
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,541
[tenant] Come one, come all! I have tea!

795
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,916
Get your tea!

796
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,958
Nice and hot! Come and get it.

797
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:52,000
- It's ginger with a touch of citrus.
- [kettle banging]

798
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,125
Get your tea.

799
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:56,375
[banging at door]

800
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:01,125
Hey, do you want any tea tonight, Kiwan?

801
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:07,500
Cut it out! You're too loud!
Stop your racket!

802
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,375
He's trying to rest! Huh?

803
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:13,375
- [door closes]
- What a bitch.

804
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:22,875
- Last chance! Get your tea!
- [kettle banging]

805
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,833
[kettle banging]

806
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:29,416
All right, I'm leaving! Last chance!

807
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,250
[tender music continues]

808
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,166
Last call for tea!

809
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,250
No one? Anyone?

810
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,500
[examiner in French]
We will start recording now.

811
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:51,291
[Kiwan in English]
This photo here is from 1997.

812
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,541
It was May Day.

813
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:57,250
We had joined a delegation
that went to Pyongyang to celebrate.

814
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:00,333
- It's my mother and I.
- [Gyeong-sil speaking French]

815
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,875
[in English] She held me in her arms
at Kim Il Sung Square.

816
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,078
[Gyeong-sil speaking French]

817

[speaking French]

818
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,267
[Gyeong-sil in English] "The photos
will be submitted as evidence."

819
01:07:10,291 --> 01:07:13,333
"And after we scan them for you,
we'll return it to you."

820
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:18,875
[speaking French]

821
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,625
[in English] "Uh, we also contacted
Cheonsim Hospital,

822
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,583
which you had mentioned
during your first interview."

823
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,916
"The hospital stated, unequivocally,
that they've never been involved

824
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,916
with the purchase or sale
of corpses or body parts at any point."

825
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:43,083
They're lying. The buying and selling
of bodies happens secretly underground.

826
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:46,833
It's not the sort of thing
the hospital would admit to, right?

827
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:49,333

[Gyeong-sil in English] "You'll have to
prove your nationality some other way."

830
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,000
"At this time,
you won't receive refugee status

831
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:02,541
because you can't prove
you defected from North Korea."

832
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:07,000
[sighs] Didn't I tell you
everything you asked me?

833
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,083
Why would I lie to you two?
You don't believe me?

834
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:11,083
[Gyeong-sil speaking French]

835
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:13,666
[speaking French]

836
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:23,875
[Gyeong-sil in English] "I'm sorry.
It's difficult to believe your statement

837
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,333
about your mother's body
being sold illegally

838
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:27,750
to Cheonsim Hospital."

839
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,708
"And since there's no proof
backing up your claim

840
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,671
that you really are a defector
from North Korea,

841
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,208
we won't be able to help you."

842
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,916
Mmm.

843
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,416
"Lastly, if we rule
that the photo you provided

844
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,875
fails to constitute as valid evidence,

845
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,000
you'll have to go."

846
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,833
"You will be
forcibly repatriated to China."

[scoffs]

848
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:54,041
You're saying I'll be deported?

[gas hissing]

850
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:06,666
Hey, do it again.
The meat still has fat on it.

851
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,833
Cut around the sides.

852
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:10,166
Hey, comrade.

853
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,708
How can you tell
if I'm really North Korean?

854
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:16,291
Well, for one,
you always say comrade when talking.

855
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,291
And, uh, just the way you look.

856
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,666
Koreans have
a totally different bone structure.

857
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,375
Comrade Seon-ju...

858
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,500
Uh, never mind.

859
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,083
Hey, what's on your mind, huh?

860
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,250
Just spit it out.

861
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,625
Hey, what is it, hmm?

862
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:51,916
Do you think you might speak on my behalf
down at the courthouse?

863
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:55,041
I think it might help
if I had a witness by my side.

864
01:09:56,291 --> 01:09:58,791
Of course I can. That's no big deal.

865
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,351
- Do you mean that? Huh?
- Yes!

866
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:03,083
You'd really come, comrade?

867
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,666
For sure.

868
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:06,375
[Kiwan] Oh, great.

869
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,750
And besides, I really need good karma soon

870
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,041
'cause my daughter
is about to have surgery.

871
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,208
Thank you, comrade.

872
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:18,291
Hey, if I end up getting refugee status,
it will all be thanks to you.

873
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,916
Hey, if you wanna pay it forward,
then get me something.

874
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Lately, I've been craving for fish.
You got that?

875
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:25,166
Okay, you got it.

876
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:27,041
[man] What would you like?

877
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:29,083
Sea bream? Two? Okay.

878
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,375
[Kiwan] Oh.

879
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,750
- My beer.
- Oh, pardon me.

880
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:46,125
- What did you do to my beer, huh?
- Sorry.

881
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,208
Hey!

882
01:10:47,291 --> 01:10:49,041
This asshole dropped my beer.

883
01:10:49,125 --> 01:10:52,250
What the hell, man?
Hey! Tough guy! What's this? [laughs]

884
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,708
- Give that back.
- Want it back? Then come get it. Huh?

885
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:57,250
Do you like it? Do you like it?
You wanna go, huh?

886
01:10:57,916 --> 01:11:01,125
- [man 2] Here, take it. Get outta here!
- [man 1 laughing]

887
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:03,583
- Go home!
- [laughs] Yeah.

888
01:11:03,666 --> 01:11:05,666
[both men laughing]

889
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,958
- [man 2] You owe me a beer.
- [man 1] Buy me a beer!

890
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:11,166
- [Kiwan] Oh!
- [man 1 screaming in pain]

891
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:16,041
- [screaming continues]
- The fuck, man? Look what you did.

892
01:11:16,125 --> 01:11:17,851
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- Hey!

893
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,541
- We need help! He's hurt!
- [woman] Hey!

894
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:21,291
[man 1 screaming in pain]

895
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:23,017
- Call the police! You're dead.
- [woman] God!

896
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:25,500
- Get the police! We need help!
- Help us, somebody!

897
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:26,833
My husband is getting attacked!

898
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:29,625
- [man 2] Help! This guy's crazy!
- Oh no! Someone call the cops!

899
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,500
Help him!

900
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,916
Someone please call an ambulance!

901
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,250
[phone buzzing]

902
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:43,541
I told you I'm not going. Stop calling me.

903
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:50,458
[Youn-sung] <i>Marie, did you recommend
someone to the factory by chance?</i>

904
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,000
So what if I did, hmm?

905
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,750
<i>What a monstrosity!</i>

906
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,541
<i>He came out of nowhere
and lunged at my husband.</i>

907
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:02,583
<i>And he attacked him for no reason!</i>

908
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,708
[man] Miss, you're next.

909
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:12,791
Uh, Loh Kiwan.
He was in the assault from last night.

910
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:15,083
- Are you a relative or his lawyer?
- No.

911
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,833
Then, no, I can't let you visit him.

912
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:21,541
- I just wanna see his face for a moment.
- It's not possible, miss.

913
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:26,625
- So what'll happen to him, then?
- He'll have three days to file an appeal.

914
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:29,500
If he doesn't,
the deportation process will begin.

915
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:31,500
Or, if you want, you can pay his bail.

916
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:37,041
- Shit!
- [officer] Calm down, miss.

917
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,166
May I remind you this is a police station?

918
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,041
Hey.

919
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,500
You're a police officer, right?

920
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,430
- This is insane.
- Please calm down, miss.

921
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:49,583
Hey, I'm not finished.

922
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:55,500
If he's deported,
then you're condemning him to die.

923
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,125
Be a police officer, huh?

924
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,458
- Carry out justice!
- [clears throat]

925
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
[Youn-sung] Marie.

926
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:23,208
[Kiwan] Wait a second.

927
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,500
Go. I have things to do.

928
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:30,208
[wistful music playing]

929
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:42,000
Here, take this.
He's a trusted friend. A good lawyer.

930
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:45,833
I heard that you've been
undergoing refugee screening.

931
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,916
I think he could
really help out your case.

932
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:49,875
Oh, thank you.

933
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,708
This means so much to me... sir.

934
01:13:53,875 --> 01:13:55,833
I have one request, however.

935
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:58,125
Yes, please go ahead, sir.

936
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,333
My daughter.

937
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:04,583
She's a very vulnerable girl.
I really want her to get better.

938
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:09,000
She needs someone strong.
Someone who can support her.

939
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:13,291
Not someone
who's just as unstable as she is.

940
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:17,125
Uh, excuse me, sir...

941
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,541
I don't think
you should see my daughter anymore.

942
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:22,916
You have too much going on in your life.

943
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:27,166
Staying in this country
is your only top priority, Kiwan.

944
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,541
[melancholy music playing]

945
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,125
Hi, Kiwan.

946
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,833
- So today's the big day.
- Are you ready?

947
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,583
- Yes.
- You'll be great.

948
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:33,125
TRIBUNAL OF BRUSSELS

949
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,333
During his first interview two months ago,

950
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:37,791
Mr. Loh, uh, provided specific information

951
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,708
that a North Korean citizen
would only know.

952
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:44,250
However, his request
was contested shortly after,

953
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:45,833
claiming insufficient proof.

954
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,541
Can you explain this lack of proof,

955
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,708
as it was the reason
that this request was denied?

956
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:54,375
The hospital to which Mr. Loh here
claims to have sold his own mother's body

957
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,916
denies this obscene and false accusation.

958
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,960
The prosecution doesn't believe
her body was sold.

959
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,250
The two photos Mr. Loh provided
were confirmed to be of Pyongyang, yes,

960
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:05,583
but they could have been taken
by Chinese travelers on vacation.

961
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:08,875
We believe these photos fail
to prove Mr. Loh's claim

962
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:11,041
that he is indeed a North Korean national.

963
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,500
Therefore, insufficient.

964
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:15,291
Furthermore, Mr. Loh claims
to have lived in the city of Yanji...

965
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,958
The prosecution doesn't believe
you have enough evidence...

966
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,916
According to our investigation,
there is nothing to support this story.

967
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,333
...so we may need to provide
stronger proof for your claim.

968
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,083
[judge 1] Have the witnesses arrived?

969
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,375
[door opens]

970
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:45,416
The résumé Mr. Loh provided

971
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:48,416
was indicative he was from Yanji, China.

972
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,166
I didn't have a reason to doubt him,

973
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,333
so he was introduced as Chinese
at the factory.

974
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:56,291
Did Mr. Loh identify himself to you
as a Chinese-born ethnic Korean

975
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:57,666
and not as a defector?

976
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,625
Sir, please take your time answering.

977
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:02,416
We just want you
to recall all of the events properly.

978
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,833
Yes. That's exactly what he said.

979
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,875
- Sir, you're lying.
- Silence, sir.

980
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,333
- Calm your client.
- Pardon.

981
01:17:11,833 --> 01:17:13,166
Mr. Loh. Mr. Loh.

982
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,250
Let's hear them out.

983
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,416
I now call Ms. Kim Seon-ju.
Please step forward.

984
01:17:20,125 --> 01:17:22,125
[pensive music playing]

985
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:27,083
I see you worked alongside Mr. Loh
over at the factory.

986
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:32,416
Were you aware Mr. Loh applied
for North Korean refugee status?

987
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:36,291
Please take your time answering, Ms. Kim,
and please remember you're under oath.

988
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:39,791
The testimony that you give
will be used as evidence in this hearing.

989
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:41,000
You may proceed.

990
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:44,208
Your Honor. Yes, I was aware.

991
01:17:44,791 --> 01:17:48,458
There are many people who are mixed
Korean and Chinese who take advantage

992
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:51,541
by saying they are defectors
from North Korea when they aren't.

993
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,791
They pretend to be North Korean defectors
immigrating for refugee benefits.

994
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,916
I suspected Mr. Loh might be one of them.

995
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:01,750
Do you know Mr. Loh's Chinese name?
What is it?

996
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:06,166
[interpreter] Ms. Kim, please tell us
the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

997
01:18:08,541 --> 01:18:10,000
Choi Ryuk-myung.

998
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:12,166
"Cui Liming," what we say in Mandarin.

999
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,000
[Kiwan] Choi Ryung-myung?

1000
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,666
You know that's not my real name.

1001
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,583
So why did you lie up there?

1002
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,625
Tell me, comrade.

1003
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,250
Betraying me like that, was it worth it?

1004
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:45,166
You told me the other day...

1005
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:49,416
that it was obvious that I'm North Korean.

1006
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,041
I wanna know why.

1007
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,875
[gasps]

1008
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:00,041
[gasping]

1009
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,333
I deserve to know why.

1010
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,541
- What are you doing, Kiwan?
- Comrade.

1011
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:04,958
Kiwan, let go!

1012
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,583
- Tell me!
- [gasps]

1013
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,708
Why'd you do it?

1014
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:16,958
Why did you do that to me?

1015
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,416
[sobs] Kiwan!

1016
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,041
Kiwan, you're... you're hurt. Let go.

1017
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:24,625
[sobs]

1018
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:27,791
[knife clatters]

1019
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:30,500
[crying]

1020
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,166
What do you want?

1021
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,583
Did you leave something here?

1022
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,166
Uh, no.

1023
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,208
I just...

1024
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,791
You can't just show up here
out of nowhere.

1025
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,250
[door lock clicks]

1026
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:34,666
[man] Start preparing for your next match.

1027
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,583
Gerd will be there.
We need him to work with us.

1028
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,541
[Marie] You came here just to say that?

1029
01:20:52,416 --> 01:20:55,541
- Coaches are supposed to be tough, Marie.
- Stop breathing down my neck.

1030
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:05,583
[sighs] I don't need your shit anymore.
I'm fine without drugs these days.

1031
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:07,416
It sure didn't seem like that last time.

1032
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,041
[sighs]

1033
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:13,625
- Listen to me.
- [grunts]

1034
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:15,291
I don't give a fuck about your refugee!

1035
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:18,125
But do as I say!
You still need to pay your debt to me.

1036
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,541
So you better stay within my sight,
you got that?

1037
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,375
You're mine.

1038
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:29,208
[exhales]

1039
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:35,041
[wistful music playing]

1040
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:58,500
[breathing heavily]

1041
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:12,041
[breathing heavily]

1042
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,416
[wistful music continues]

1043
01:22:39,958 --> 01:22:41,291
- [coin clatters]
- [door buzzes]

1044
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,666
[wistful music continues]

1045
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,250
FREE

1046
01:23:19,458 --> 01:23:20,583
[music fades]

1047
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:23,000
[man] Gerd put down three million on you.

1048
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,750
If we can double that,
that's half our debt all paid off.

1049
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:30,333
I rigged the game.
You're guaranteed to win.

1050
01:23:31,416 --> 01:23:32,791
So just have fun out there.

1051
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,333
[gunshots]

1052
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:36,708
[beep]

1053
01:23:36,791 --> 01:23:38,666
[crowd cheering]

1054
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:43,416
[crowd chanting] Chloe! Chloe!

1055
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
[host] The tension is palpable, folks!

1056
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,166
Now it's time for Chloe's last shot!

1057
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:53,250
[tense music playing]

1058
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,892
- [scoreboard chimes]
- [crowd cheering]

1059
01:23:54,916 --> 01:23:56,125
[host] 8.2 for Chloe!

1060
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,291
Nice work, Chloe!

1061
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:02,750
[woman 1] Hey! Learn to shoot!

1062
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:06,250
[beep]

1063
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:20,125
[crowd clamoring]

1064
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,333
[gunshot]

1065
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:23,750

1066
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:26,833

[crowd cheering]

1068
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:29,541
[woman 2] What the fuck?

1069
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:33,375
[host] What a disaster!
She missed the entire target.

1070
01:24:33,458 --> 01:24:34,791
What just happened, folks?

1071
01:24:35,458 --> 01:24:38,541
In this unprecedented event,
Chloe wins the match!

1072
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:41,708
Now, please, folks, calm yourselves!

1073
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:45,125
Please don't throw anything!
Folks, please restrain yourselves!

1074
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,500
Where the hell
do you think you're going, huh?

1075
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,208
You're on your own from now on.

1076
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,791
Listen, you won't survive out there
without me. You're nothing!

1077
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:57,458
No.

1078
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,041
You're wrong.

1079
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:05,833
Damn it!

1080
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:08,916
[breathing heavily]

1081
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:14,875
[music fades]

1082
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:33,125
Kiwan, hey.

1083
01:25:33,666 --> 01:25:35,833
Hey, listen to me, Kiwan. Wait!

1084
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:37,916
Before the trial,
a person from the refugee office

1085
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,500
came to the factory.

1086
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:42,750
They said they would shut us down if
they learned your documents were forged.

1087
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:46,375
So that's why we let you take the fall
for everyone else's sake.

1088
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:50,041
He said I wouldn't get my visa renewed
if I didn't lie about everything.

1089
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,958
My, um, my daughter's operation
is very soon,

1090
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,625
and she relies on my wages.

1091
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:57,476
In the end, it turns out
he didn't even renew my visa.

1092
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,250
What do you want me to say to you, hmm?

1093
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,250
Oh, that's too bad.
It must've been hard for you.

1094
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:04,458
- [scoffs]
- No, hey! Don't go!

1095
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:07,291
I just really want to apologize to you.

1096
01:26:09,083 --> 01:26:12,291
I'm being deported soon.
I got caught without a visa.

1097
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:15,041
I'll be back in China with my children,

1098
01:26:15,125 --> 01:26:18,208
so I don't think I will ever be
in Belgium again, so, uh...

1099
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,791
I had to see you before I leave.

1100
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:25,750
[sobs] I'm so sorry... comrade Loh Kiwan.

1101
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,625
[melancholy music playing]

1102
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:36,833
[door closes]

1103
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,625
[Mr. Lee] I heard back from
a well-known defectors' advocacy group.

1104
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:12,416
They'll submit a statement of support,
and they'll even attend your next trial.

1105
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,458
This will definitely help
increase your credibility, I believe.

1106
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,041
Don't give up hope yet, okay?

1107
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:21,625
Okay.

1108
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:24,750
Would you like something to drink?
A juice or coffee?

1109
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,375
[Kiwan] Juice, please.

1110
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:36,250
IN MEMORY OF LEE JEONG-JU

1111
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:40,666
DAUGHTER: LEE MARIE

1112
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,833
- [organ music playing]
- [bell chimes]

1113
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:56,666
What are you doing here?

1114
01:27:57,625 --> 01:28:01,583
Once I found out this was happening today,
it felt wrong not to come.

1115
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,250
So I'd like to pay my respects
by helping out.

1116
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:23,333
My wife left us all
three years ago, as you know.

1117
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,041
This will be my family's
last public memorial service.

1118
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:30,083
[pants, sniffles]

1119
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:33,333
[Youn-sung] Moving forward,
we will get together privately

1120
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:36,250
to honor her and her legacy.

1121
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,750
Marie.

1122
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:46,583
[sighs] Got a good turnout, I see.

1123
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:48,666
[Youn-sung] Marie.

1124
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:53,375
Ah...

1125
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:57,541
Everyone's so dressed
and eating such nice food,

1126
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:59,416
all for someone that's dead.

1127
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,750
What does this accomplish?

1128
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:06,166
Go be sad at home.

1129
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:09,500
Why do this when it's all just
one big show for you, huh?

1130
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,250
What?

1131
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:18,916
[laughs] Are you afraid people might
point fingers if they knew what you did?

1132
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:20,416
Stop this!

1133
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:22,416
Stop what?

1134
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:27,458
Stop what, Dad?

1135
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:31,750
What did I do? What?

1136
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,233
- [guests clamoring]
- I told you to stop! You need to leave!

1137
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:35,958
[exclaims] Ah!

1138
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:41,750
Listen! Because of your actions that day,
I no longer have a mother. She's dead.

1139
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,166
Put that down right now.

1140
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,583
Do you know what you did?

1141
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:48,416
I died a long time ago. Understand?

1142
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,416
I understand, hmm? Now give me that!

1143
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,208
Get the fuck away!

1144
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:58,958
Stay away from me! Don't you ever dare
tell me what to do anymore, okay? Okay?

1145
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:01,833
[Marie sobs]

1146
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:03,708
[panting]

1147

[wistful music playing]

1152
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,083
Marie, open the door, please!
Marie! [grunts]

1153
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:51,333
- [water sizzling]
- [coughs] Marie! Marie!

1154
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:00,750
[coughing]

1155
01:31:00,833 --> 01:31:03,625
[Marie] The floor is like jelly.
Will I fall? [chuckles]

1156
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:06,208
[Kiwan breathing heavily, coughs]

1157
01:31:06,291 --> 01:31:09,541
[Marie] The floor is wobbling.
It's too damn much.

1158
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:12,250
It's jelly!

1159
01:31:13,041 --> 01:31:14,416
I'm seasick.

1160
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,750
[man] Just sit down. Standing is bad shit.

1161
01:31:16,833 --> 01:31:20,458
Yeah, just sit. Nice.
[laughs] Who is this guy?

1162
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:23,416
[Marie] Huh? What?

1163
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,458
- [man] Who is this clown?
- You're here.

1164
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:27,166
- [man laughs]
- [groans]

1165
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:29,708
[man] Is the circus in town?
Where'd you come from?

1166
01:31:29,791 --> 01:31:32,684
- [Marie] I came from the North.
- [junkie] This you on vacation? Oh, Marie.

1167
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:35,791
Want a vacation?
This will take you far away.

1168
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,000
Good girl.

1169
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:39,791
[grunts] Hey! Are you insane?

1170
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:40,875
Crazy bastard!

1171
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:41,916
[door slams]

1172
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,458
- Marie.
- [laughs]

1173
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:48,541
- Marie.
- [laughs]

1174
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,500
- Marie, give it to me.
- [laughs]

1175
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,208
Let go!

1176
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:54,166
[Marie gasps]

1177
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:57,666
Shit. Shit.

1178
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,791
Fuck off! You don't get to stop me!

1179
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:02,416

- Marie!
- Let go!

1182
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:08,625
Stop this!

[Marie pants]

1184
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:12,208
Do you want to die?
Is that what you want, huh?

1185
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:13,291
No.

1186
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:15,916
If I die, I can't do drugs.

1187
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:18,250
Why would I throw this all away?

1188
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:20,458
If you wanna die,

1189
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:22,708
then be my guest.

1190
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:24,708

[unsettling music playing]

1193
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:33,291
Hey, wait.

1194
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,500
That's not yours! Give it!

1195
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,416
Oh shit!

1196
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:40,541
[Marie panting]

1197
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:45,166
That's mine!

1198

[Kiwan grunting]

1202
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,500
[Marie] Hey!

1203
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,500
Hey, what's wrong? Spit it out!

1204
01:33:14,583 --> 01:33:15,791
Spit it out!

1205
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:17,375
Kiwan, I said spit it out!

1206
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:18,916
Oh God!

1207
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:21,333
[breathing frantically] Hey.

1208
01:33:21,416 --> 01:33:23,041
Kiwan, please wake up!

1209
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:24,583

Nicky!

1212

Open up! Open the door!

1213
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:35,541
Nicky!

1214
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:40,041
[groans] I need the... antidote!

1215
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:43,291
Hurry, get it! Hurry and get it!
Please hurry! Get it!

1216
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:48,583
Please, please.

1217
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:51,625

1218

1219
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:02,791
[coughing]

1220
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:05,708
Hey, Kiwan.

1221
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:08,708
Are you okay?

1222
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:14,208
[Kiwan] You're...

1223
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,416
You really are something.

1224
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:19,166
Why do you do...

1225
01:34:19,666 --> 01:34:21,041
[coughs]

1226
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:22,166
...that kind of stuff?

1227
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,708
I was so worried about you.
Why did you do that?

1228
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:26,208
[sighs]

1229
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:28,416
I'm sorry.

1230
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,458
It's my fault.

1231
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:34,791
I kept pushing you away.

1232
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:35,916
[sniffles]

1233
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,541
You're all bark but no bite. That's it.

1234
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:42,166
You like to pretend you're cruel,
but you're not.

1235
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:46,166
Behind that tough act is a sweet girl.

1236
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:49,833
Marie.

1237
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:53,791
If you ever take drugs again,

1238
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,000
I'll do what I just did.

1239
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,125
I'll do it again.

1240
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:03,958
If you ever try to hurt
or destroy yourself,

1241
01:35:04,958 --> 01:35:07,500
I'll follow you to hell
and drag you out myself.

1242
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:11,916
I'll help you find the light.

1243
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,375
You go that?

1244
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:20,000
[breathes deeply]

1245
01:35:34,291 --> 01:35:36,000
[sentimental music playing]

1246

1247
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:56,041
[moans]

1248
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:25,875
[Kiwan] What is this of?

1249
01:36:26,375 --> 01:36:28,250
It was my mom's favorite flower.

1250
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:31,416
[Kiwan] Hmm.

1251
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,166
Well, it's pretty.

1252
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,375
[Marie] What happened here?

1253
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:43,333
[Kiwan] Well,

1254
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:48,083
when my mother... and I
ran from North Korea...

1255
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:56,041
we both, um... we both carried
razor blades in our clothes.

1256
01:36:57,166 --> 01:36:58,375
Why?

1257
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,458
Just in case the police

1258
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:06,291
tried to send us back there.
We both would have rather died.

1259
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:11,208
It was our backup plan.
We always carried them with us.

1260
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:14,791
So, on both our left wrists,

1261
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,083
we ended up having
a few attempts together.

1262
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,833
[wistful music playing]

1263
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:28,333
Marie.

1264
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:30,583
Listen.

1265
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:37,375
When I was living in China,
I broke the law.

1266
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:41,083
I got involved in a fight at work.
I should've ignored it.

1267
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:45,750
The police were looking for me,
so I went into hiding.

1268
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:48,166
Ultimately...

1269
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:53,583
that circumstance led
to my mother's death.

1270
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:58,500
So, does someone like me...

1271
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:04,083
deserve to be happy despite what happened?

1272
01:38:11,083 --> 01:38:13,000
I ask myself the same question.

1273
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,041
I'm like you.

1274
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:24,083
We might think we don't deserve a lot.

1275
01:38:28,416 --> 01:38:30,166
But at least we have each other.

1276
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,000
And that's enough for me.

1277
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:39,250
[Kiwan sniffles]

1278
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:47,833
[Kiwan sobs]

1279
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:02,041
Uh, Marie, isn't this

1280
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:04,958
a little too much? I feel overdressed.

1281
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:07,125
A little overdressed is all right.

1282
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,458
Like a true Belgian, hmm?

1283
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:13,125
Mmm! How about that?

1284
01:39:14,958 --> 01:39:17,500
- Don't do that. There's people outside.
- Just kiss me!

1285
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:18,583
- Mr. Loh.
- Kiss me back!

1286
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:19,767
- Uh, ah...
- [Kiwan] Mr. Hyeok.

1287
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:21,208
[splutters, chuckles]

1288
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:23,541
Here. This just came from China.

1289
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,434
- Really?
- You should open it and take a look.

1290
01:39:25,458 --> 01:39:27,958
Uh... Thank you so much.

1291
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:29,583
I'll leave you two.

1292
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:31,291
- Oh, no...
- [Marie chuckles]

- Glad to hear.
- Oh, you too.

1316

- Thanks for coming today, everyone.
- Yes, thank you.

[Gi Soon] Oh, you're too kind.
I still don't know how I get published.

I love your work.
They made me cry, actually.

I appreciate it.

- Excuse me.
- Of course.

01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:55,625
I'm really sorry,
but someone is waiting for me.

1342
01:41:56,708 --> 01:41:57,708
What's going on?

1343
01:41:58,208 --> 01:42:00,333
So I forgot
that the plumber was coming by.

1344
01:42:00,416 --> 01:42:01,976
- It seems I have to run home now.
- Oh.

[car horn honks]

1346
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:10,333
So promise me you won't worry.
I'll return before the trial ends.

1347
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:13,291
Okay. Just hurry back when you're done.

1348
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:14,666
Mm-hmm. I'll be quick.

1349
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:20,500
[Gi Soon] But back then,
when they originally broke away from us...

1350
01:42:20,583 --> 01:42:22,703
[prosecutor] We gather here today
for the second trial

1351
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,208
in the case between the Kingdom of Belgium

1352
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:27,458
and Mr. Loh Kiwan.

1353
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:29,125
This article right here

1354
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:31,833
was originally published
in a local newspaper in China

1355
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:35,708
in the small town of Yanji,
on December 5th of last year.

1356
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,875
It describes the unfortunate death
of a North Korean defector.

1357
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:42,041
She was struck by a bus
late during the night.

1358
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:45,083
The accident described
in this newspaper article

1359
01:42:45,166 --> 01:42:47,041
completely corresponds in perfect detail

1360
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:50,541
with the story Mr. Loh recounted
in his first interview.

1361
01:42:50,625 --> 01:42:54,791
The photo he provided of his mother
is clearly the woman in the paper.

1362
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:56,500
I now call Loh Kiwan.

1363
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:58,500
Can you state your name
for the court, please?

1364
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,916
My name is... Loh Kiwan.

Give me the conditions
for your next match.

01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:36,625
I'll have my girl ready.

1370
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:50,916

01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:55,666
[Gerd] Your girl,

1374
01:43:56,291 --> 01:43:59,166
I don't want her for just... one season.

1375
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:03,041
The player... for your debt.

1376
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,166
She aimed at "zero," and you are screwed.

1377
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:12,000
She shouldn't be wasted
at such a small-time shop as this.

1378
01:44:12,916 --> 01:44:14,333
She's out of your league.

1379
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,083
That will be better

1380
01:44:19,041 --> 01:44:20,458
for her too.

1381
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:25,916
Please don't do this.

01:44:32,875 --> 01:44:33,875
[Marie gasps]

[grunts, groans]

1387
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:38,833
[panting]

1388
01:44:41,458 --> 01:44:42,833
You piece of shit.

1389
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:44,833
It's over for you.

1390
01:44:46,916 --> 01:44:50,416
[prosecutor] Mr. Loh
then applied for refugee status

1391
01:44:51,541 --> 01:44:54,500
as a North Korean defector
sometime last December.

1392
01:44:54,583 --> 01:44:56,250
As his case was being reviewed,

1393
01:44:56,333 --> 01:44:59,458
he started a new job
but using Chinese papers.

1394
01:44:59,541 --> 01:45:03,875
You'll see the evidence of these acts
on page three of Mr. Loh's case file.

1395
01:45:04,666 --> 01:45:05,666
[car horn honks]

1396
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,166
[sighs]

1397
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:19,791
Mr. Loh, sit down, please.

1398
01:45:19,875 --> 01:45:21,583
Uh, Mr. Loh, what are you doing?

1399
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:26,541
I need to go. Sorry, Mr. Hyeok.

1400
01:45:26,625 --> 01:45:28,375
- Why?
- Marie needs me.

1401
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:29,500
Mr. Loh, you can't just...

1402
01:45:29,583 --> 01:45:31,333
Sir, sit down, please.
Return to your seat!

1403
01:45:31,416 --> 01:45:32,916
[tense music playing]

1404
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,500
[grunts]

1405
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,208
[unsettling music playing]

1406
01:45:46,083 --> 01:45:47,843
[man] Get the rest of the cash
from the safe.

1407
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:50,541
- Get armed and ready. They're coming.
- [thug 1] Got it.

1408
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:55,561
Marie, we've gotta move fast. [grunts]

1409
01:45:56,833 --> 01:45:58,666
We both need to leave the country
right now.

1410
01:46:00,083 --> 01:46:03,000
- Why would I go with you?
- You're my player. You belong to me.

1411
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:05,208
We're a pair.

1412
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:08,208
That means... they'll look for you too.

1413
01:46:08,291 --> 01:46:10,166
His men will be here any minute.

1414
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:12,458
So we need to get out of this country.

1415
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:15,000
Listen to me!

1416
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:16,750
I'm not going with you.

1417
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:18,708
I don't belong to you!

1418
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:20,875
You'll be safe with me.

1419
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:24,375
A place in Amsterdam will take us in.
I've already made the arrangements.

1420
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,458
We can start our own shooting parlor there

1421
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:28,625
without someone like Gerd
always butting in.

1422
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:31,250
It'll be different this time.
It's an opportunity.

1423
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:32,541
You don't have a choice.

1424
01:46:32,625 --> 01:46:34,375
[panting]

1425
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:38,750
You really are a monster!

1426
01:46:40,875 --> 01:46:43,208
You're right, Marie.
I'm a complete monster.

1427
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:46,833
But this fucking world made me a monster.

1428
01:46:46,916 --> 01:46:48,041
I can't help it!

1429
01:46:49,125 --> 01:46:50,833
How about I give you a real taste of it?

1430
01:46:50,916 --> 01:46:52,166
[footsteps approaching]

1431
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:53,375
[Kiwan] Marie!

1432
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,208
Marie! Marie!

1433
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:57,291

1434
01:46:57,333 --> 01:46:58,416
Marie! Marie!

[grunting]

1436
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,666
[man] Fucking bastard!

1437
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:03,041
[Marie] Don't touch him!

1438
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,458
- Get off of me!
- [Marie grunts]

1439
01:47:04,541 --> 01:47:05,416
[man] Stay down.

1440
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:06,541
[grunting]

1441
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:12,000
Get away from him!

1442
01:47:12,583 --> 01:47:13,791
I said get away!

1443
01:47:15,458 --> 01:47:16,541
[Marie grunts]

1444
01:47:17,375 --> 01:47:19,416

[man grunts, gasps]

1446
01:47:22,541 --> 01:47:23,416
Marie.

- [Kiwan screams]

01:47:39,916 --> 01:47:42,375
[both grunt, groan]

1453

- [man screams]
- [gunshot]

[man screams in pain]

[groans]

1458
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:19,393
What are you waiting for? Come on, huh?

1459
01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:20,833
[gasps]

1460
01:48:20,916 --> 01:48:22,000
[man] Don't hesitate.

1461
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:24,333
Just shoot.

1462
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:27,000
[both scream]

1463
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,833

[gun clatters]

1465
01:48:49,125 --> 01:48:50,125
Let's go.

1466
01:48:52,625 --> 01:48:54,291
Marie!

1467
01:48:56,375 --> 01:48:57,416
[groans]

1468
01:48:59,625 --> 01:49:01,625

[gunshots]

1474
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,083
[man 3] Gerd is dead.

1475
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:39,041
Understood.

1476
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:41,583
I'll get the girl and bring her to Berlin.

1477
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:48,583
[man 4] Where is the girl?

1478
01:49:49,458 --> 01:49:50,958
[scoffs]

1479
01:49:52,583 --> 01:49:54,041
You can go fuck yourself.

1480
01:50:11,416 --> 01:50:12,625
[Kiwan] Marie.

1481
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:18,708
You're... you're safe. Don't worry, okay?

1482
01:50:19,458 --> 01:50:20,458
Huh?

1483
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:30,750
Marie.

1484
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:34,333
Hear me out. You can't stay here.

1485
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:44,125
They'll look for you.

1486
01:50:45,083 --> 01:50:47,083
[melancholy music playing]

1487
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,041
If you want to be free from those men,

1488
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,125
leave Belgium forever.

1489
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:56,125
You need to call your dad.

1490
01:50:56,958 --> 01:50:58,708
He'll take you to the airport today.

1491
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:00,583
And what about you?

1492
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:04,041
I can't leave without you, Kiwan.

1493
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:05,541
Huh?

1494
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:09,458
I still don't have citizenship, so, uh...

1495
01:51:12,791 --> 01:51:14,916
I can't come and go as I please just yet.

1496
01:51:17,375 --> 01:51:18,708
But you already knew that.

1497
01:51:22,833 --> 01:51:23,875
[sighs]

1498
01:51:26,375 --> 01:51:27,416
[sighs]

1499
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:31,750
All of this is my fault.
I ruined everything.

1500
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:41,000
We were in such a good place,
and now it's all over.

1501
01:51:48,166 --> 01:51:49,250
That's not true.

1502
01:51:51,875 --> 01:51:53,375
What we have is too strong.

1503
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:56,375
Nothing can tear us apart.

1504
01:51:59,958 --> 01:52:01,000
[Marie sniffles]

1505
01:52:04,916 --> 01:52:06,916
Listen, what if I told you...

1506
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:13,750
the best thing to happen to me
was stealing your wallet, huh?

1507
01:52:16,166 --> 01:52:17,333
When I first met you,

1508
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,666
I was about ready to give up.

1509
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:23,833
I kept going just to see your face again.

1510
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:29,708
But you made me believe life was worth it.

1511
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:35,500
You're the reason I'm still here, Kiwan.

1512
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:43,250
Your father once said to me...

1513
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:47,833
I wasn't strong enough to be with you.

1514
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:53,583
His words were like daggers in my heart.

1515
01:52:55,291 --> 01:52:56,875
I felt unworthy of you.

1516
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,791
But that's when I promised myself...

1517
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,875
I would become the person you needed.

1518
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:14,791
A guy that would always be there for you.

1519
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:20,666
So I vowed to prove your father wrong.

1520
01:53:22,833 --> 01:53:24,375
You mean a lot to me, Marie.

1521
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:26,666
Hmm.

1522
01:53:29,041 --> 01:53:30,250
So someday soon...

1523
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:33,833
we'll be together again.

1524
01:53:35,541 --> 01:53:37,541
[Marie sighs]

1525
01:53:38,791 --> 01:53:40,708
[sniffles, sighs]

1526
01:53:42,666 --> 01:53:43,750
[music fades]

1527
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:49,166
[Kiwan] He's here.

1528
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:08,708
Hop in the back.

1529
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,208
[Youn-sung] Oh, yeah. Uh...

1530
01:54:57,041 --> 01:55:00,083
So, uh, call me as soon as you land
to tell me you're safe.

1531
01:55:07,458 --> 01:55:08,625
Loh Kiwan,

1532
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:10,833
that young man...

1533
01:55:11,833 --> 01:55:13,500
Turns out he's a special guy.

1534
01:55:15,166 --> 01:55:17,416
Looking back,
I wish I was a little bit nicer.

1535
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,583
Please forgive me.

1536
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:28,500
[sentimental music playing]

1537
01:55:28,583 --> 01:55:30,500
There was a time when Mom got worse.

1538
01:55:34,208 --> 01:55:36,458
So she would ring a bell
when she needed help.

1539
01:55:37,166 --> 01:55:38,875
I wanted to ease her pain,

1540
01:55:38,958 --> 01:55:41,375
but at the same time,
I couldn't bear to look at her.

1541
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:43,541
So I...

1542
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:49,583
sometimes wished
she would fall asleep and never wake.

1543
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:54,333
I felt so guilty for that.

1544
01:55:56,375 --> 01:55:58,666
And though I tried to hide it, she knew.

1545
01:56:00,166 --> 01:56:01,583
After she died, um...

1546
01:56:04,083 --> 01:56:06,166
I blamed myself for what happened to her.

1547
01:56:11,583 --> 01:56:13,291
You should have woken me up, huh?

1548
01:56:19,583 --> 01:56:20,666
There you go.

1549
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:26,166
[emotional music playing]

1550
01:56:29,375 --> 01:56:30,375
[Jeong-ju] Please.

1551
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,250
Please let me go.

1552
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:38,041
I just lie around all day...

1553
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,708
and wait to die.

1554
01:56:42,791 --> 01:56:44,916
It's unbearable to go on like this.

1555
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:48,875
I can't go on.

1556
01:56:52,333 --> 01:56:54,291
- Jeong-ju, I, uh...
- My love.

1557
01:56:56,708 --> 01:56:59,625
I'm making you and Marie
miserable each day.

1558
01:57:00,666 --> 01:57:02,666
I don't want to live like this anymore.

1559
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:07,958
Make sure that Marie
will never know the truth.

1560
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,125
[sobs]
