1
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:31,744
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

2
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:40,753
<i>Seems like a cold sweat
creepin' across my brow</i>

3
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,923
<i>Yeah</i>

4
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:49,762
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

5
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:58,771
<i>I'm feelin' motherless somehow</i>

6
00:01:02,817 --> 00:01:08,406
<i>Stars with evil eyes</i>

7
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,451
<i>Stare from the skies</i>

8
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:14,621
<i>All mean and bright</i>

9
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:18,291
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

10
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:25,006
<i>Ain't a woman yet been born</i>

11
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:34,140
<i>Knows how to make the mornin' come</i>

12
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:42,941
<i>It's so hard to keep control</i>

13
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:47,028
<i>When I could sell my soul</i>

14
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:49,989
<i>For just a little light</i>

15
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:53,701
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

16
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:59,457
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

17
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:08,758
<i>I've got trouble wall to wall</i>

18
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:12,762
<i>Oh yes, I have</i>

19
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:15,598
<i>I repeat</i>

20
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:18,184
<i>I repeat, in the night</i>

21
00:02:21,563 --> 00:02:26,901
<i>Must be an ending to it all</i>

22
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:36,411
<i>But hold on, it won't be long</i>

23
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:39,038
<i>Just you be strong</i>

24
00:02:39,998 --> 00:02:42,584
<i>And it'll be all right</i>

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,379
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

26
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,810
Where you keepin' the pie tonight?

27
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,315
A man ate the last piece
just before you come in.

28
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:14,157
What's that little old orphan
sittin' right up there?

29
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,493
Marble cake.

30
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:24,500
Tell you what, Sam. Bein' she's
in there by her little old lonesome,

31
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,544
I'll let you have her for free.

32
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,340
I told you 'bout that "Sam" business,
didn't I? Hm?

33
00:03:30,506 --> 00:03:34,636
Sorry, Mr Wood.
I mean, uh... Officer Wood.

34
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,936
<i>Well, a bow-legged Polly
and a knocked-kneed Paul</i>

35
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,438
<i>A bow-legged Polly
and a knocked-kneed Paul</i>

36
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:30,108
<i>A bow-legged Polly
and a knocked-kneed Paul</i>

37
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,985
<i>They can't get together at all</i>

38
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:35,238
<i>Just like the worm in the cornfield
said to his brother</i>

39
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:38,283
<i>"Yeah, go in one ear and out the other"</i>

40
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:54,048
<i>Well, a bucktoothed Clara
and a cross-eyed Clyde</i>

41
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:56,301
<i>A bucktoothed Clara
and a cross-eyed Clyde</i>

42
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:59,554
<i>Like old bow-legged Polly
and a knock-kneed Paul</i>

43
00:06:09,874 --> 00:06:12,710
<i>Every time I see your face</i>

44
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:15,380
<i>It's got a way of turnin' me around</i>

45
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:30,562
<i>You tune me in, pretty baby</i>

46
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,855
<i>Wild things begin</i>

47
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:35,775
<i>Baby, that ain't love</i>

48
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,779
<i>But it sure is groovy</i>

49
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:50,808
It's Colbert, all right.
Skull's caved in.

50
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:57,023
You ever take a homicide
picture before, son?

51
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:59,525
Well, at least he won't be movin' on me.

52
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:04,155
That's for sure. I want you to cover every
angle. Do you hear me? Every angle.

53
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:06,699
Uh, you boys, move on back now, OK?

54
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:09,994
Came all this way to build us a factory,

55
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:12,872
make somethin' outta this town.

56
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:16,626
Look what it got him.

57
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,505
Yeah.

58
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:25,802
Sam, did he have a wallet,
identification, anything like that?

59
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:29,514
That's the first thing I looked for.
Whoever fixed him musta took 'em.

60
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,474
Nothin'.

61
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,562
- Any witnesses?
- I mean, not even a cat.

62
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,609
- How long's he been dead?
- Oh, less than an hour.

63
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:45,154
- Less than an hour.
- Maybe half that.

64
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,323
Maybe half.

65
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:53,663
Could have been a hitchhiker.

66
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:57,542
Check both ends of town, check
the depot, and check the pool hall. OK?

67
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:01,129
- Pool hall closed at one o'clock, Chief.
- I said check it, Sam.

68
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,673
Yes, sir.

69
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:24,671
On your feet, boy.

70
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:32,011
I mean now!

71
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:42,981
Get against that wall.
Get them hands high!

72
00:10:43,106 --> 00:10:45,942
Spread them fingers out.
I wanna count all ten.

73
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:54,117
You move before I tell you to, boy,
by God, I'm gonna clean your plough.

74
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:21,936
That's pretty fat there, ain't it, boy? Huh?

75
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:30,194
Now, outside there's a police car.
You're gonna pick up that bag.

76
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,990
You're gonna walk out, and you're
gonna plant yourself in the back.

77
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:37,493
And you're gonna be
a real nice quiet boy all the way in.

78
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:39,913
You hear?!

79
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:02,310
C'mon, boy.

80
00:12:02,435 --> 00:12:04,479
Move it!

81
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,409
Chief here?

82
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:21,454
- Hey, what's up, Sam?
- Chief?

83
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,623
What's goin' on?

84
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,377
Sam?

85
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,994
- Wood?
- Yes, sir?

86
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,456
When's the last time I asked Courtney
to get oil for this damn thing?

87
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,625
Uh, last Wednesday.

88
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:12,714
Would you be kind enough to go outside
and remind him what day it is today?

89
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:15,341
Well, uh... how about the prisoner here?

90
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:18,928
Don't you worry about him.

91
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:21,514
Got a name, boy?

92
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:23,725
Virgil Tibbs.

93
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,561
Virgil?

94
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:33,526
Well, I don't think we're gonna
have any trouble, are we, Virgil?

95
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:37,071
No trouble at all.

96
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,040
Oh, you can go now, Sam.

97
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:49,208
Yes, sir.

98
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:57,383
- What did you hit him with?
- Hit whom?

99
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,094
"Whom"? Whom?

100
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:05,058
You a Northern boy? What's a Northern
boy like you doin' all the way down here?

101
00:14:05,183 --> 00:14:09,646
- I was waiting for the train.
- There ain't no trains this time of mornin'.

102
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:13,483
- Tuesdays only. 4.05 to Memphis.
- You say.

103
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,574
Well... All right, you say right.

104
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:36,256
All right... Virgil.

105
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,717
Oh!

106
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,886
Now look.

107
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,600
I try to run a nice, clean, safe town here.

108
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:53,314
A town where a man can sneeze and not
get his brains beat out. You follow me?

109
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:55,942
Yes.

110
00:14:56,067 --> 00:15:01,197
Why don't you tell me how you killed
Mr Colbert? You'll feel a whole lot better.

111
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:05,868
Not now!

112
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:23,595
I was visiting my mother.

113
00:15:23,761 --> 00:15:26,931
I came in on the 12.35 from Brownsville.

114
00:15:27,098 --> 00:15:31,394
I was waiting to go out on the 4.05.

115
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:36,733
Mm-hm.

116
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,370
Yeah.

117
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:54,417
And meanwhile, you killed yourself
a white man and picked yourself up $200!

118
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:57,420
I earned that money,
ten hours a day, seven days a week.

119
00:15:57,545 --> 00:16:03,134
Coloured can't earn that. It's more than I
make in a month! Where did you earn it?!

120
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,345
- Philadelphia.
- Mississippi?

121
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,848
- Pennsylvania.
- Just how do you earn that kinda money?

122
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:11,434
I'm a police officer.

123
00:16:50,265 --> 00:16:52,141
Oh, yeah.

124
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,613
- Wood!
- Yes, sir!

125
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,827
- Did you question this man?
- No, sir.

126
00:17:14,664 --> 00:17:17,417
Would you mind taking a look at that?

127
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:24,090
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

128
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:30,889
I'll check on this wise city boy.
You take him outside and hold him.

129
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:32,599
Yes, sir.

130
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:36,936
May I suggest that you call my chief
rather than send a wire or anything?

131
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:41,399
I mean, it would be quicker.
And I'll pay for the call.

132
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,153
Did you hear? Did you hear him
say he'd pay for the call?

133
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,197
How much do they pay you
to do their police work?

134
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:51,367
$162.39 per week.

135
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,831
$162.39 a week!

136
00:17:56,998 --> 00:18:01,127
Well, boy! Take him outside, Wood.
But treat him easy,

137
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:05,506
because a man that
makes $162.39 a week -

138
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:08,009
man, we do not wanna ruffle him!

139
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,304
No, sir!

140
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:24,484
Courtney... would you try
and get me long-distance?

141
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:37,956
Police business, honey.
Chief's on the line.

142
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:42,627
No. He catch you listenin' in,
he'll run your butt around the block.

143
00:18:42,794 --> 00:18:45,296
- He don't panic me none.
- No?

144
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:49,884
- Where's the chief?
- You got the pictures of the dead man?

145
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:53,388
Sure do. I got him top,
bottom, sideways - you name it.

146
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:56,641
- Good. I'll take 'em, son.
- No, I wanna give 'em to the chief.

147
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:00,228
- I said I'd take 'em, Charlie.
- Do like he tells you, Charlie.

148
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:02,564
Somebody owes me
some money for those.

149
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,733
I had to buy paper and film
and developin'.

150
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,446
That's all right. Just bill the department.
Everything will be taken care of.

151
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:14,492
God Almighty. He sure looks bad.

152
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,456
May I see the man
I am supposed to have killed?

153
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,335
Sure. I don't know why not.

154
00:19:25,753 --> 00:19:28,840
Hey, Sam. He's finished talkin'.

155
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:34,637
- Here's the photos of the dead man.
- OK.

156
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:39,309
Got your chief on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

157
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:49,193
Hello? Yes, sir. I'm sorry
to have gotten you involved in this.

158
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,821
I really had no choice.

159
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,200
Yes, sir.

160
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:02,040
You can't be serious, sir. I mean, even
if I could be of help, they wouldn't want it.

161
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,085
No, sir. I'm not prejudiced.

162
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:11,758
Yes, sir. I am a police officer
and they're police officers, but...

163
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:21,309
Hello. This is Gillespie.
Yes, sir. Yep, well...

164
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:24,520
You don't say?

165
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,732
He's your number one homicide expert?

166
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,817
Well, my, my, my.

167
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:33,196
I don't think we need any help.
We can wrap this up ourselves.

168
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:35,615
Yes, sir. But I do want to thank you

169
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:40,328
for offering me such a powerful piece
of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.

170
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:43,289
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Yeah. Goodbye, now.

171
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:50,755
Oh, it's all there.
We paid for the phone call ourselves.

172
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,763
Now, you are the number one
homicide expert.

173
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,809
- That's right.
- I bet you look at a lot of dead bodies.

174
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:04,936
Lots.

175
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:06,854
Well?

176
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:10,608
- Well, what?
- Well...

177
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:15,363
I just thought maybe, uh... Maybe you
wouldn't mind takin' a look at this one?

178
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:18,032
No, thanks.

179
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:21,286
- Why not, expert?
- Because I've got a train to catch.

180
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:24,080
Wait a minute.
That train don't leave till noon.

181
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:28,751
They pay you $162.39 a week just to look
at bodies. Why can't you look at this one?

182
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:33,172
- Why can't you look at it for yourself?
- Because I'm not an expert...

183
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:34,424
Officer!

184
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:49,564
Ten cents, ten million dollars - just
doesn't matter when a man's time comes.

185
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:51,566
Mm-hm.

186
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:54,611
I could give him a nicer service
right here in Sparta

187
00:21:54,777 --> 00:21:58,990
than he could ever get up there
in Chicago. And at half the price, too.

188
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:02,201
I got a rosewood casket out there...

189
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,372
Ted Ulam, Chief.
We haven't had the pleasure.

190
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,541
That's for sure.

191
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:12,712
He's with me.

192
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:17,133
Hello, Doc.

193
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:20,887
Yep.

194
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,812
Well...

195
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:32,148
Uh...

196
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:35,652
Do you wanna look at it?

197
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:05,431
New manicure. That's good.

198
00:23:11,145 --> 00:23:13,189
That's very good.

199
00:23:28,663 --> 00:23:31,583
- I'll need a few things.
- Such as?

200
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:36,337
Ammonium hydrosulphide,
benzidine, superoxide of hydrogen.

201
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:41,009
Copper powder, distilled water.

202
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:54,480
A six-inch celluloid scale.

203
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,233
Thermometer.

204
00:23:57,901 --> 00:23:59,944
Some tweezers.

205
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,198
Callipers. And some toothpicks.

206
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:07,327
Toothpicks?! Copper...?
What's goin' on here, Chief?

207
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:09,412
Who is this boy anyway?

208
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:12,999
I asked him to look at the body.
That's who he is.

209
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,501
It's 4.45. What time was this man killed?

210
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:21,257
Sam found him at 3am. The doctor says
it's possible he was killed an hour earlier.

211
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:24,302
- At two?
- Maybe a little later.

212
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:27,055
2.15... 2.30?

213
00:24:27,222 --> 00:24:29,724
Would you feel the face and jaw, please?

214
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:32,977
Am I mistaken, or has rigor begun?

215
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:36,147
It has.

216
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:40,568
You'll notice too
that postmortem lividity is present.

217
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:44,572
So the time of death really has
to be earlier. Wouldn't you say?

218
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:46,282
Mm.

219
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:50,203
Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that
as soon as I get a thermometer.

220
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,415
As you know, the loss of heat from
the brain is the most reliable way

221
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,043
of determining time of death.

222
00:24:58,044 --> 00:24:59,587
Right, Chief?

223
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:02,924
Oh, yeah.

224
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,555
Well...

225
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:13,393
Which one of you gentlemen
will assist me?

226
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,322
Ulam's Funer... It's for you, Chief.

227
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,953
Yeah. Talk to me.

228
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,913
When?

229
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:39,002
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I've
got a runaway suspect, boy. I gotta go.

230
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:44,382
Now listen, you. Anything he wants,
man, you better see that he gets it.

231
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:50,597
Where can I wash my hands?

232
00:27:24,941 --> 00:27:28,611
This here's Shagbag, you hear?
He's headed for the river.

233
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:32,490
The river, you hear?
He's gonna be in Arkansas.

234
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,742
Shoot.

235
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:21,474
OK. I got him.

236
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:30,084
Mrs Colbert.

237
00:30:30,877 --> 00:30:35,006
- How is she taking it?
- Chief had to leave. She don't know it yet.

238
00:30:43,097 --> 00:30:45,558
Hey! You can't go in there, boy!

239
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:53,024
- Mrs Colbert?
- Where's my husband?

240
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:58,321
What's happened to him? Why won't
anybody tell me what's happened to him?

241
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:02,242
Why won't anybody here tell me?
I have a right to know if he's hurt,

242
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,703
if he's been in an accident.
I want to know if he is all right!

243
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,164
Your husband is dead, Mrs Colbert.

244
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,460
Uh...

245
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:14,629
Somebody killed him.

246
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,508
We don't know who - yet.

247
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:43,074
It's, uh...

248
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:47,370
It's very hot in here.

249
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:49,956
It's very hot in this room.

250
00:31:55,086 --> 00:31:56,880
Sit down.

251
00:31:57,755 --> 00:31:59,549
No.

252
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:25,992
Would you...

253
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:35,627
Would you... leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

254
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,808
Virgil, we don't need you or your
microscopes. Tell that to your chief.

255
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:34,394
We don't need him - or you.

256
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:37,564
Mrs Colbert's in there.

257
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,568
- I've already told her.
- I see.

258
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:45,780
Here is the examination results from
Ulam's. You wanna know what I found?

259
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:48,783
No. I don't need to look at 'em now.

260
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:51,244
May I examine this prisoner?

261
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:54,497
Yeah, you can look at him.
C'mon, let him look. Go on.

262
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:19,105
All right, now! Steady!

263
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:23,067
You finished?

264
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,154
Thank you.

265
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:31,034
All right, Fryer, bring him with me.

266
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:38,249
- Now we're grindin' corn!
- You shoulda been there!

267
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:42,170
If it weren't for them radios,
we woulda lost him goin' over that bridge.

268
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:45,340
That old boy highballing that train
like to cut us off.

269
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:47,592
And old Charlie's hound dog got loose...

270
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,552
- Did he confess?
- Huh?

271
00:34:49,677 --> 00:34:53,181
The man you arrested, did he confess?

272
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:55,725
Well, I believe he will.

273
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:58,394
Yes siree, I believe he will.

274
00:34:58,561 --> 00:35:00,772
I believe he will.

275
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:03,733
- He's left-handed, isn't he?
- How do I know?

276
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,527
Well, he seemed left-handed to me.

277
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:10,990
I believe Harvey is a southpaw.
Now, ain't he, Shagbag?

278
00:35:11,157 --> 00:35:13,618
What if he is? What's that make him?

279
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:17,121
Innocent.

280
00:35:18,164 --> 00:35:22,460
Mrs Colbert... There's just one more thing.

281
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,637
Yeah.

282
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:38,101
I picked it up, I tell you. He was already
lyin' there. It was lyin' there next to him!

283
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,397
I just picked it up, ma'am. That's all I did.

284
00:35:42,522 --> 00:35:44,399
Shut up.

285
00:35:44,566 --> 00:35:47,652
- Get him outta here.
- OK. C'mon, Harvey. Let's go.

286
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:05,461
Mrs Colbert, I, uh... I wonder if you'd mind
if I have somebody drive you over

287
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:10,133
so you could, uh...
complete the identification?

288
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:34,991
Martin, I want you to take
Mrs Colbert over to the funeral parlour.

289
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:37,160
And, Wood, run Virgil down the depot.

290
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:41,956
Uh... Virge here, Chief,
he thinks that Harvey's innocent.

291
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:47,295
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Could I talk to you about it, in private?

292
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:51,925
No. Because I got Colbert's wallet in my
hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.

293
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,177
- You think he gave it to him?
- I don't know.

294
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:58,431
But Oberst could have come along
after the crime, found it, picked it up.

295
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:01,851
- I don't know.
- That's what the boy said he did.

296
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:05,855
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I say different.

297
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:09,525
When I examined the deceased,
it was obvious the fatal blow was struck

298
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:11,778
from an angle of
17 degrees from the right,

299
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:15,990
which makes it almost certain
the person who did it is right-handed.

300
00:37:16,115 --> 00:37:19,118
- So what?
- Harve's left-handed, Chief.

301
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:22,330
- Everybody in town knows that.
- We figured that out.

302
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:24,874
Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.

303
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:32,674
You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny
name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.

304
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:37,262
- What do they call you up there?
- They call me Mr Tibbs!

305
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:41,432
Mr Tibbs! Well, Mr Wood, take Mr Tibbs,
take him down to the depot.

306
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:44,394
And I mean, boy, like now!

307
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:56,906
I'll have the FBI lab
send you the report on this.

308
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:00,368
Not that it'll make any difference.

309
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,329
I'll take that.

310
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:07,083
No, you won't.

311
00:38:10,587 --> 00:38:13,923
I'm sending it in personally.

312
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:20,513
My God!

313
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:25,351
What kind of people are you?

314
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:29,063
What kind of a place is this?

315
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:35,945
My husband is dead.

316
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:40,575
Somebody in this town killed him!
I want you to find out who!

317
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,759
You gonna give me that?

318
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:01,888
No, I'm not.

319
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:07,060
Wood, you take him,

320
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:10,313
and you lock him up
for withholding evidence.

321
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:15,610
Go on, move! Put him with
his friend, Harvey Oberst!

322
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:28,706
Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains
to the hogs, that's for damn sure.

323
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:34,045
Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.
We got another customer.

324
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:38,383
Hey, man, not in here.

325
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:41,678
- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button.

326
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:44,681
Play it cool, boy. Play it cool.

327
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:46,849
Hey!

328
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,143
Hey!

329
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:58,361
What you doin'
wearin' white man's clothes?

330
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,323
Where d'you come from?

331
00:40:05,451 --> 00:40:07,954
You deaf or somethin'?

332
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:12,250
Listen, I'm get...

333
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,795
Keep cool, Harvey.

334
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,428
I'm on your side.

335
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,555
Well, I don't need you!

336
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,724
I'm all you've got.

337
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,943
Police?

338
00:40:39,944 --> 00:40:42,447
You're a cop?

339
00:40:43,156 --> 00:40:45,283
- You're a cop.
- Mm-hm.

340
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,243
Yeah?

341
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,206
So, how come they locked you up?
How come they lock up a cop?

342
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:53,583
Who said they locked me up?

343
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,379
How come with all these empty cells here
they'd throw me in with you? You dig?

344
00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:05,553
Look.

345
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:08,431
I already told 'em.

346
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,352
I see this fella lyin' on the street there.

347
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,856
And there's this wallet lyin' beside him.

348
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,736
Boy, I mean, I come into
this world outta luck.

349
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:25,490
Here's the first good thing
to come my way. And I pick it up.

350
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:29,869
But when I see whose wallet it is...

351
00:41:30,912 --> 00:41:36,417
I mean, I start to sweat. But I heard
about this new chief. This Gillepsbie?

352
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:38,711
Got no more smile than a turnip.

353
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:43,174
So I cut across the fields, headin' for the
line, and got myself as far as the bridge

354
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:45,510
before Gillepsbie grabbed me.

355
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:48,054
What time did you find the wallet?

356
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:54,936
Well, I ain't got no watch, but it must have
been after two, by the courthouse clock.

357
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:58,439
I'm interested in eleven to two.
Where were you?

358
00:41:58,606 --> 00:42:02,360
Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.
I got there about ten.

359
00:42:02,527 --> 00:42:05,446
- What time'd you leave?
- Closin'. Must have been one.

360
00:42:05,613 --> 00:42:09,742
- Anybody can swear for you?
- Packy, Bert, Les.

361
00:42:13,997 --> 00:42:16,583
Ever been in trouble
with the police before?

362
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:20,753
Come on.

363
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:23,965
I could ask at the desk, you know.

364
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:31,431
Well, they brought me in one time.

365
00:42:32,557 --> 00:42:35,643
- On account of this Delores Purdy.
- On what charge?

366
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:42,525
Well, uh, this Delores, she, uh...

367
00:42:44,485 --> 00:42:47,989
she's real proud of what nature
done for her, you know?

368
00:42:48,656 --> 00:42:50,533
And, uh...

369
00:42:50,658 --> 00:42:55,121
Well, we was on a date
up to Clarke's Point, and, uh...

370
00:42:56,623 --> 00:42:59,292
she says, uh...

371
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:02,795
Anyway, she asks me, she says, uh...

372
00:43:02,921 --> 00:43:06,257
"Don't you think I got a classy build?"

373
00:43:06,382 --> 00:43:08,593
And I say "Sure. "

374
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:11,554
And so she starts to show me.

375
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:15,058
But I didn't do nothin' wrong.

376
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,728
I just didn't stop her from
tryin' to prove her point.

377
00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:22,607
Then this cop, Sam Wood,

378
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:25,860
comes chargin' outta the bush
and hauls me in.

379
00:43:26,277 --> 00:43:28,613
He let you go, didn't he?

380
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,367
Told me not to mess with her no more.
She lives on Third, a block from me.

381
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:35,453
Traipsin' around in the altogether.
With the lights on.

382
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,332
Now, somebody sure oughta
make her stop doin' that.

383
00:43:39,499 --> 00:43:41,543
Come here.

384
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:47,006
Let me see your right hand.

385
00:43:51,594 --> 00:43:54,097
- What you doin'?
- Hold still.

386
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:18,538
All right now, give him
the waiver for false arrest.

387
00:44:19,414 --> 00:44:21,207
Forget it.

388
00:44:21,374 --> 00:44:24,210
I'm askin' you to sign it. Please.

389
00:44:28,214 --> 00:44:30,633
Give him a pen. Give him a pen.

390
00:44:41,603 --> 00:44:44,063
All right. Let him out.

391
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,907
You'll be able to catch the 12.10 train.

392
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:59,996
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to change the charge against Oberst.

393
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:05,001
He was nowhere near the scene
of the crime, and I think he can prove it.

394
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:09,422
- I bet you know when Colbert was killed.
- About 12.30.

395
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:13,468
- While Harvey was still shooting pool.
- Wait a minute. I'll get it.

396
00:45:15,428 --> 00:45:18,348
There's cue chalk under his nails,
not dried blood.

397
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:21,643
- Thank God I don't live in Philadelphia.
- One more thing.

398
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:24,354
Colbert wasn't killed
where the body was found.

399
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,107
- What do you mean?
- He was killed then moved to Main Street.

400
00:45:39,494 --> 00:45:41,538
- Courtney?
- Yes, sir?

401
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:46,459
Change the charge to theft.

402
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:48,878
D'you mean Harve?

403
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:51,714
Who the hell else do we have back there?!

404
00:45:51,881 --> 00:45:53,925
Yes, sir.

405
00:45:57,095 --> 00:45:59,138
Hey.

406
00:46:00,098 --> 00:46:02,141
Didn't I ask you to fix that gate?

407
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:08,147
No, not me, sir. Must have been
my brother Harold. He's on days.

408
00:46:08,815 --> 00:46:11,192
Harold.

409
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:24,414
Police department.

410
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,583
Yes, he's here. Hold on, sir.

411
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:29,085
Mayor's on the line, Chief.

412
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:39,697
What's all this Miz Colbert's been
tellin' me about a... a cover-up arrest?

413
00:47:41,616 --> 00:47:44,202
No, ma'am. We ain't had no cover-up.

414
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:48,498
In fact, we just dropped the charges
for insufficient evidence.

415
00:47:49,332 --> 00:47:52,252
Miz Colbert, I told you
he was nobody's man.

416
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:56,548
I came by to make it
as clear as I possibly can

417
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:00,802
that I do not want that Negro officer
taken off this case.

418
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:05,306
Negro officer?

419
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,603
Yeah, well, he, uh...
He comes from up North, you see.

420
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,273
And he was, uh, kinda...

421
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:19,946
- passin' through...
- If it wasn't for him,

422
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:24,492
your impartial chief of police would still
have the wrong man behind bars.

423
00:48:26,661 --> 00:48:29,581
I want that officer given a free hand.

424
00:48:29,747 --> 00:48:34,294
Otherwise, I will pack up
my husband's engineers...

425
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:39,799
and leave you...

426
00:48:41,759 --> 00:48:43,803
to yourselves.

427
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,563
Miz Colbert, now don't you
worry about a thing.

428
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:56,774
Believe me, we're gonna
take care of everything.

429
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,361
Bill?

430
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:09,621
I wanna see you come through
this now, you hear?

431
00:49:09,787 --> 00:49:13,291
Even if we have to
step on Endicott's toes?

432
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,418
Even that.

433
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,629
But do it fast.

434
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:20,924
All right.

435
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:23,885
Now, Bill, how about
this here Negro officer?

436
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:26,512
Miz Colbert seems
to have confidence in him.

437
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:29,182
Oh, he ain't nothin'. Some kind of a...

438
00:49:30,892 --> 00:49:34,479
some kind of a homicide expert.
But I don't need him.

439
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:39,859
You mean you don't want him.
But you do need him.

440
00:49:41,402 --> 00:49:45,114
Now look, Bill.
Suppose he turns up the killer.

441
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:50,620
He has no police power here. He's gonna
have to hand him over on a platter, right?

442
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,580
That's right.

443
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:58,628
And if he fails, you're off the hook, cos it
was Miz Colbert's idea in the first place.

444
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:01,130
See what I mean?

445
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:03,424
Oh, yeah.

446
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,636
Works out all the way around, Bill.
For all of us.

447
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:09,931
Excuse me.

448
00:50:42,463 --> 00:50:44,966
Any reason why you have to leave today?

449
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:47,802
There's lots of reasons.

450
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:53,016
What would you say if
I asked you to stay for a while?

451
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:54,976
No.

452
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:10,575
This town needs a factory, Virgil.

453
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,244
Colbert come down
from Chicago to build it.

454
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:17,540
I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.
Half of them'd be coloured.

455
00:51:18,499 --> 00:51:21,753
- Know what that means?
- Probably got him killed.

456
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,882
That's what Mrs Colbert thinks.
She wants us to catch her a killer.

457
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,801
No killer, no factory.

458
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:33,139
Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta
coloured people. You follow me?

459
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:37,644
- I'm going home, man.
- They're your people.

460
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:41,147
Not mine - yours. You made this scene.

461
00:51:41,314 --> 00:51:45,944
- What do you want me to do? Beg you?
- Look, I've had your town up to here!

462
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:50,740
Boy, it would give me a world
of satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!

463
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,332
My father used to say that.

464
00:52:02,585 --> 00:52:06,714
- Even did, once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.

465
00:52:08,132 --> 00:52:10,593
Now you listen to me.

466
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,429
Just once in my life
I'm gonna hold my temper.

467
00:52:13,555 --> 00:52:15,765
I'm tellin' you that you're gonna stay.

468
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:20,436
You'll stay here if I have to have your
chief remind you what he told you to do.

469
00:52:20,562 --> 00:52:22,939
But I don't think
I have to do that, you see?

470
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:27,402
No. Because you're so damned smart.
You're smarter than any white man.

471
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:30,196
You're just gonna stay here
and show us all.

472
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:34,617
You could never live with yourself
unless you could put us all to shame.

473
00:52:36,494 --> 00:52:38,997
You wanna know something, Virgil?

474
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:44,752
I don't think that you could let
an opportunity like that pass by.

475
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,420
Jess?

476
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:29,464
Jess, this is, uh...

477
00:53:29,631 --> 00:53:32,217
This is Virgil. He's workin' for me.

478
00:53:33,134 --> 00:53:35,345
Give him somethin' that runs. Fix him up.

479
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:38,890
What I fix, runs. Who pays?

480
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,975
Police.

481
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:46,022
Well, you know where to find me.

482
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:27,730
What you doin' here, man?

483
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:29,983
Policeman.

484
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:33,236
You're a policeman here in Sparta?

485
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:37,407
They've got a murder
they don't know what to do with.

486
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:39,993
They need a whipping boy.

487
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:50,670
You got a roof?

488
00:54:51,504 --> 00:54:54,674
No. I'll find a motel.

489
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:02,849
Viola... We got company.

490
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,151
Know what's gonna happen?

491
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:15,361
He gonna get hisself killed.

492
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,990
You watch and see he don't.

493
00:55:19,157 --> 00:55:22,827
I'm aware of the risk, Tom.
But, like it or not, we're stuck with him.

494
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:25,997
Not if the chief here is right on the ball.

495
00:55:26,915 --> 00:55:32,921
What do you say, Chief? You got that old
killer all lined up in your front sights, hm?

496
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:36,966
I'm workin' on it.

497
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:39,302
Tom, climb off of Gillespie's back now.

498
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:43,348
You know damn well we didn't
hire him off a homicide squad.

499
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,393
Yeah, well, it's gonna be his week.

500
00:55:47,518 --> 00:55:50,438
Cos Colbert's only the start.

501
00:55:50,563 --> 00:55:52,815
I say this nigger won't live past Saturday.

502
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:08,831
Mrs Colbert, can you tell me
about your husband's enemies?

503
00:56:08,957 --> 00:56:13,086
That's Endicott.
He's been fighting us all the way.

504
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:17,298
He sits up on his hill
and runs this county.

505
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:20,051
Or did, until we moved in.

506
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,600
Did your husband tell you
where he was going last night?

507
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:33,606
He said he wasn't sleepy. I went to bed.

508
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,526
What time was that?

509
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:39,863
A little after 11, I think.

510
00:56:41,406 --> 00:56:44,492
Did he call you, or anybody
on your staff, after 11?

511
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,328
No.

512
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:52,834
Maybe the elevator boy
can tell us what time he went out.

513
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:55,378
They put it on self-service after ten.

514
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:02,719
Did your husband use a car here?

515
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,091
Find anything?

516
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:26,803
- Whoever killed Colbert drove this car.
- How do you know?

517
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,015
Where you goin'?

518
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:37,397
I'd drive up there, but I'm sure you don't
want me running up there by myself.

519
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:39,566
- Up where?
- Eric Endicott's.

520
00:58:39,691 --> 00:58:41,234
Endicott's?! Come on, now!

521
00:59:30,658 --> 00:59:33,828
None of that for you, huh, Virgil?

522
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:45,215
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

523
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:49,219
<i>Mm-hm, ain't a woman yet been born</i>

524
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:54,307
<i>Yeah</i>

525
00:59:55,934 --> 01:00:00,396
<i>Knows how to make the mornin' come</i>

526
01:00:04,943 --> 01:00:09,239
<i>It's so hard to keep control</i>

527
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,032
<i>Yes, it is</i>

528
01:00:11,157 --> 01:00:14,994
<i>When I could sell my soul</i>

529
01:00:16,204 --> 01:00:18,414
<i>For just a little light</i>

530
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,669
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

531
01:00:39,143 --> 01:00:41,813
Listen. You know
something I don't know?

532
01:00:43,356 --> 01:00:46,609
I found a piece of osmunda
in Colbert's car.

533
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:50,446
- A piece of what?
- On the brake pedal. Osmunda. Fern root.

534
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:54,242
Fern root? Oh, is Mr Endicott here?

535
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:57,996
Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.
Would you follow me, please?

536
01:01:23,688 --> 01:01:26,149
- Gillespie.
- Mr Endicott.

537
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:29,360
This here's Virgil.

538
01:01:30,445 --> 01:01:33,281
- Mr Tibbs.
- How do you do, sir?

539
01:01:33,448 --> 01:01:37,076
Oh, may I have Henry fetch you
somethin'? Some light refreshment?

540
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:42,123
- No, thank you. We're all right...
- I'll have something cold, soft. Anything.

541
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:45,210
Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.
I'll have one, too.

542
01:01:45,376 --> 01:01:47,420
Yes, sir.

543
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:51,925
I didn't know it was possible
to grow this species locally.

544
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,344
- Oh, you like flowers?
- I do.

545
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,804
Mr Tibbs, do you know
anything about orchids?

546
01:01:56,971 --> 01:02:00,850
- Not very much, but I do like them.
- Well, let me show you.

547
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,897
Endicott's folly.

548
01:02:09,275 --> 01:02:13,488
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful. It's breathtaking.

549
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:18,493
- Have you a favourite, Mr Tibbs?
- Well, I'm partial to any of the epiphytics.

550
01:02:18,618 --> 01:02:21,037
Why, isn't that remarkable!

551
01:02:21,955 --> 01:02:25,708
That of all the orchids in this place,
you should prefer the epiphytics.

552
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,919
I wonder if you know why.

553
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,089
Maybe it would be helpful if you'd tell me.

554
01:02:31,256 --> 01:02:34,175
Because, like the Negro,

555
01:02:34,342 --> 01:02:38,137
they need care and feedin' and cultivatin'.

556
01:02:39,264 --> 01:02:41,307
And that takes time.

557
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:46,437
That's somethin' you can't make
some people understand.

558
01:02:46,604 --> 01:02:49,858
That's somethin'
Mr Colbert didn't realise.

559
01:02:56,698 --> 01:02:59,284
Is this what the epiphytics root in?

560
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:02,120
My point! They thrive on it.

561
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,956
Take it away from them, they do poorly.

562
01:03:05,707 --> 01:03:09,377
- What do you call this material?
- That's osmunda. Fern root.

563
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:20,471
Well, we don't wanna take
any more of your time, Mr Endicott.

564
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,436
Why'd you two come here?

565
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:36,529
To ask you about Mr Colbert.

566
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:42,869
Let me understand this.

567
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:46,789
You two came here... to question me?

568
01:03:50,043 --> 01:03:52,795
Well, your...

569
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:55,131
your attitudes, Mr Endicott,

570
01:03:55,256 --> 01:03:58,676
your points of view,
are a matter of record.

571
01:03:59,844 --> 01:04:03,181
Some people - let us say
the people who work for Mr Colbert -

572
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:07,852
might reasonably regard you as the
person least likely to mourn his passing.

573
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:13,316
We were just trying
to clarify some of the evidence.

574
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:19,280
Was Mr Colbert ever in this greenhouse?
Say, last night, about midnight?

575
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,622
Gillespie?

576
01:04:27,747 --> 01:04:29,707
Yeah?

577
01:04:29,874 --> 01:04:33,670
- You saw it.
- Oh, I saw it.

578
01:04:34,504 --> 01:04:38,091
What are you gonna do about it?

579
01:04:40,134 --> 01:04:42,971
I don't know.

580
01:04:43,429 --> 01:04:45,473
I'll remember that.

581
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:53,857
There was a time...
when I could have had you shot.

582
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:29,267
- You better clear out. And I mean fast!
- What about that speech you gave me?

583
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,645
I didn't know you'd slap any white man!
Least of all Endicott!

584
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:35,690
All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.

585
01:05:35,815 --> 01:05:40,111
I can pull that fat cat down.
I can bring him right off this hill!

586
01:05:42,530 --> 01:05:44,324
Oh, boy.

587
01:05:46,618 --> 01:05:49,120
Man, you're just like the rest of us.

588
01:05:50,371 --> 01:05:52,582
Ain't ya?

589
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:09,682
It's all my fault.

590
01:06:13,895 --> 01:06:15,939
But there's no point in ducking it.

591
01:06:16,064 --> 01:06:18,733
It's gonna be tough
to keep you in your job now.

592
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:25,240
Now look here, Bill. I don't have to tell you
how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.

593
01:06:25,406 --> 01:06:28,576
- No. I already told him to go.
- All right.

594
01:06:28,743 --> 01:06:31,829
Now, Miz Colbert
is not gonna be back till Thursday.

595
01:06:31,955 --> 01:06:33,998
You catch your guilty party by then,

596
01:06:34,165 --> 01:06:37,752
she won't hold it against us we had
to send Tibbs home for his own good.

597
01:06:37,919 --> 01:06:40,588
But you gotta do it, you hear?

598
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:42,799
I hear.

599
01:06:44,342 --> 01:06:45,885
Bill?

600
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:51,849
What's made you change
your mind about Tibbs?

601
01:06:52,016 --> 01:06:54,060
Who says I have?

602
01:06:54,852 --> 01:06:57,230
Last chief we had,

603
01:06:57,397 --> 01:07:02,735
he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he
slapped Endicott, claimed self-defence.

604
01:07:20,211 --> 01:07:22,255
- Gillespie here.
- Courtney here, sir.

605
01:07:22,422 --> 01:07:26,718
- Did you take Virgil down the depot?
- No, sir. He just plain wouldn't go.

606
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:29,929
- Shagbag saw him headin' to River Road.
- Check.

607
01:07:53,995 --> 01:07:56,039
Hey! C'mon! C'mon!

608
01:08:23,316 --> 01:08:25,109
Hey! C'mon!

609
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:25,021
OK, black boy. We come here
to teach you some manners.

610
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:32,195
We told you about them bad manners,
boy. You better put that down.

611
01:10:37,492 --> 01:10:40,078
Why don't you
come and get it, baby?

612
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:04,727
C'mon, man. You ain't nothin'.
C'mon. Let's get him.

613
01:11:08,273 --> 01:11:10,316
We'll put that round your neck.

614
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,700
Hit him, man! Get him from the side!

615
01:11:31,838 --> 01:11:33,965
Get behind him!

616
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:38,845
All right, hold it!

617
01:11:44,684 --> 01:11:46,477
All right, boys.

618
01:11:49,397 --> 01:11:53,318
You've had your fun.
Now go on, you just run along home.

619
01:11:56,905 --> 01:11:59,115
Nigger-lover.

620
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:13,379
- I didn't catch what you said.
- Get rid of the nigger.

621
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:16,799
You don't... we will.

622
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,554
Now, is that a suggestion,
or is that an order?

623
01:12:21,721 --> 01:12:23,765
That's a warnin'!

624
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:28,645
I see.

625
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:31,564
I see.

626
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:40,114
Shut up and take this trash outta here!
Come on, move it and go!

627
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,793
Well, you finally get the message, Virgil?!

628
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:07,850
May I get in?

629
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:10,603
- Thought you left town.
- Not yet.

630
01:13:15,733 --> 01:13:19,612
Could you follow the same route you
followed Tuesday night, same speed?

631
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:22,198
- Why?
- Why not?

632
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:29,998
- Maybe I better check with the chief.
- I wouldn't want him to slap you down

633
01:13:30,164 --> 01:13:32,750
for steppin' outta line,

634
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:35,670
makin' decisions on your own,
and all that.

635
01:13:37,505 --> 01:13:40,341
He don't knock me outta my socks.

636
01:13:43,011 --> 01:13:45,221
Let's get rollin', Virgil.

637
01:14:03,823 --> 01:14:06,492
<i>All you little birds better lock up tight</i>

638
01:14:06,618 --> 01:14:09,871
<i>Cos there's a foul owl
on the prowl tonight</i>

639
01:14:10,872 --> 01:14:14,459
<i>Hey, little lark, get outta the dark</i>

640
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:18,338
<i>Foul owl on the prowl</i>

641
01:14:18,504 --> 01:14:22,091
<i>Cute little jay, stay outta his way</i>

642
01:14:22,217 --> 01:14:25,053
<i>Foul owl on the prowl</i>

643
01:14:26,012 --> 01:14:29,849
<i>You just might be the quail he'll tail</i>

644
01:14:29,974 --> 01:14:33,478
<i>Foul owl on the prowl</i>

645
01:14:33,645 --> 01:14:37,357
<i>You just might be
the swallow he'll follow</i>

646
01:14:37,524 --> 01:14:40,360
<i>Foul owl on the prowl</i>

647
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:44,739
<i>If you hear him hoot - scoot</i>

648
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:48,618
<i>If you pass his tree - flee</i>

649
01:14:49,494 --> 01:14:52,413
<i>If you catch his eye - fly</i>

650
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:56,209
<i>Don't wait to say goodbye</i>

651
01:14:56,584 --> 01:15:00,547
Take ten minutes to get myself
a king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.

652
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,467
That is, if that peckerwood
ain't sold out again.

653
01:15:07,512 --> 01:15:11,432
- Can I bring you anything?
- No. I'm coming in.

654
01:15:22,694 --> 01:15:24,737
I thought I told you to get outta here.

655
01:15:24,904 --> 01:15:27,740
- I'm not ready to leave.
- I was gonna tell you, Chief.

656
01:15:27,907 --> 01:15:30,827
- You forget about those four maniacs?
- I need more time.

657
01:15:30,952 --> 01:15:33,955
- Do I have to put you on the train myself?!
- I guess so!

658
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,124
Whoa.

659
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:41,296
All right, Virgil.
Just what the hell do you want?

660
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:46,551
I wanna know exactly where Sam was
at all times on the night of the murder.

661
01:15:46,968 --> 01:15:49,888
<i>If you pass his tree - flee</i>

662
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:53,850
<i>If you catch his eye - fly</i>

663
01:15:54,392 --> 01:15:59,355
Virgil, if you get killed, we'll have one hell
of a mess in this town. You know that?

664
01:16:01,149 --> 01:16:03,193
I know.

665
01:16:22,629 --> 01:16:25,548
Got some real luscious cream pie
for you tonight, Sam.

666
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:28,718
I mean Officer Wood.
Just like you always order.

667
01:16:28,843 --> 01:16:33,306
You know I don't eat that stuff. The chief
likes his boys streamlined. Right, Chief?

668
01:16:33,473 --> 01:16:35,892
Why don't you shut up, Sam?

669
01:16:37,143 --> 01:16:40,730
- All right, what'll you have, Virgil?
- I ain't servin' him!

670
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:53,535
Tuesday night you walked
out of here at 2.40. Right?

671
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:55,745
Right on the button.

672
01:16:56,704 --> 01:16:59,165
Two minutes from now.

673
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,598
That's for him.

674
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:34,701
Now, what'd you do
when you came out that night?

675
01:17:35,702 --> 01:17:38,121
Well, I picked up the radio and called in.

676
01:17:38,288 --> 01:17:39,914
Do it, please.

677
01:17:40,081 --> 01:17:42,542
Go ahead. Go ahead.

678
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:55,096
Uh... Wood to radio.
I'm leavin' Compton's now.

679
01:17:55,221 --> 01:17:58,474
Sam, look sharp.
Gillespie's sniffin' around.

680
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:00,685
Gimme that thing!

681
01:18:01,519 --> 01:18:05,398
Courtney, your brother says I didn't
tell him to fix that hinge, so I told you.

682
01:18:05,565 --> 01:18:07,442
Do you read me, Courtney?

683
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:10,695
- Oh, I'll get right on it, Chief.
- I'd do that if I were you.

684
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:12,864
Yes, sir. Ten-four.

685
01:18:32,383 --> 01:18:35,887
All right, you can move us. Officer Wood.

686
01:19:19,347 --> 01:19:22,183
- Why'd you do that, Sam?
- Do what?

687
01:19:22,308 --> 01:19:25,144
Change your route
back there at the corner.

688
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:30,525
Who says I changed?

689
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:37,240
Look, I oughta know what I did!
Chief, do I have to put up with this?

690
01:19:37,407 --> 01:19:39,868
Do I work for you, or do I work for him?

691
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:45,874
Good night, gentlemen.

692
01:20:15,028 --> 01:20:17,322
I don't know.

693
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:20,575
- I don't know.
- Well, I appreciate anything you can do.

694
01:20:22,243 --> 01:20:25,413
- This is highly irregular.
- Yeah, I know that.

695
01:20:25,538 --> 01:20:30,668
Showing our depositors' accounts?
Hm. I don't know.

696
01:20:33,379 --> 01:20:37,300
- You sure this is an official request?
- Yes. It's official, yes.

697
01:20:40,929 --> 01:20:44,432
- You willing to put that in writing?
- Yeah. I'll put it in writing.

698
01:20:44,599 --> 01:20:46,893
On police department letterhead?

699
01:20:47,018 --> 01:20:50,438
I would write it on the head of a pin
if you want it there.

700
01:20:50,563 --> 01:20:54,692
- I gotta have somethin' for the file.
- I realise that, but I'm in a hurry.

701
01:20:54,817 --> 01:20:57,737
Well, we'll see.

702
01:20:59,656 --> 01:21:03,785
He's had an account with us
for several years now.

703
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:05,703
That so?

704
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:08,873
Not a large account.

705
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,752
Never more than... Yeah.

706
01:21:17,549 --> 01:21:19,842
$208.

707
01:21:19,968 --> 01:21:23,638
That was back in '62. September.

708
01:21:24,806 --> 01:21:29,102
I am not interested in '62 September.
I am interested in yesterday.

709
01:21:29,269 --> 01:21:31,938
Yesterday? Well...

710
01:21:34,482 --> 01:21:36,860
Well.

711
01:21:36,985 --> 01:21:42,115
According to this,
he made a deposit of... $632.

712
01:21:42,282 --> 01:21:44,242
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

713
01:21:44,409 --> 01:21:48,288
- Thank you.
- Must have been when I was out to lunch.

714
01:21:48,454 --> 01:21:51,124
A deposit that size, I'd remember.

715
01:21:51,249 --> 01:21:54,836
Oh, you'll send me that letter
for the file, you hear?

716
01:21:54,961 --> 01:21:59,173
I'll tell you, baby brother, the chief
didn't like him, not even from the first.

717
01:22:01,426 --> 01:22:03,887
- Morning.
- Where do you think you're goin'?

718
01:22:04,053 --> 01:22:06,472
It's all right. Let him go.

719
01:22:11,603 --> 01:22:16,065
I just talked to the FBI lab. We can
prove Colbert was in that greenhouse.

720
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:18,401
Endicott's covering up.

721
01:22:18,526 --> 01:22:21,613
I'm afraid you're too late.
We already got the guilty man.

722
01:22:21,738 --> 01:22:24,240
- Who?
- Sam.

723
01:22:24,866 --> 01:22:27,076
- Sam?
- That's right.

724
01:22:31,789 --> 01:22:33,416
Our man is Endicott.

725
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:37,045
You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?

726
01:22:37,212 --> 01:22:40,548
And yesterday he makes
a big cash deposit at the bank.

727
01:22:40,673 --> 01:22:43,092
If I told you once,
I told you a hundred times

728
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:46,846
that I won that matchin' quarters
and halves. It took me three years!

729
01:22:46,971 --> 01:22:49,015
Then why was it in big bills? I checked.

730
01:22:49,182 --> 01:22:53,144
Because whenever I got enough change,
I'd trade it in on $20 bills.

731
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:56,397
And when I got up to $600,
I took it down and put it in the bank.

732
01:22:56,523 --> 01:23:01,528
The day Colbert was killed, he cashed
a cheque for $900, $600 of which is gone,

733
01:23:01,694 --> 01:23:06,074
$300 of which I believe you left in the
wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!

734
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:10,745
- What kinda man do you think I am?!
- Now, don't you push me, boy!

735
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,627
Now listen.

736
01:23:17,794 --> 01:23:20,380
If you weren't suspicious of Sam here,

737
01:23:20,547 --> 01:23:24,676
why did you question him last night
when he changed his route?

738
01:23:27,095 --> 01:23:29,847
- I knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?

739
01:23:30,014 --> 01:23:33,893
He was afraid I'd see
some naked white girl down the block.

740
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,396
- What?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.

741
01:23:36,563 --> 01:23:40,859
She parades around in the nude
at night to get her kicks. That's...

742
01:23:42,235 --> 01:23:43,945
- How do you know?
- I know.

743
01:23:44,112 --> 01:23:46,322
Well, I know. Do you understand?

744
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:49,576
I know that Colbert
cashed a cheque for $900.

745
01:23:49,742 --> 01:23:52,328
I know that Sam made a big cash deposit.

746
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:56,624
I know that you caught him in a lie.
And I know that's enough for me.

747
01:23:58,126 --> 01:24:00,169
C'mon, Sam.

748
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:02,380
Martin, lock him up.

749
01:24:06,217 --> 01:24:08,011
Well?

750
01:24:11,598 --> 01:24:15,727
Well... you're making a mistake.

751
01:24:16,394 --> 01:24:18,855
Don't you bet against it.

752
01:24:21,482 --> 01:24:23,985
You can catch your train now, Virgil.

753
01:24:47,133 --> 01:24:48,927
Tibbs?

754
01:24:51,596 --> 01:24:54,140
Do you think Sam did it?

755
01:24:57,644 --> 01:25:00,563
- Where do I find the chief?
- What's it all about?

756
01:25:00,688 --> 01:25:02,315
My business.

757
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:06,569
Hey, look, Purdy.

758
01:25:06,736 --> 01:25:10,698
Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.

759
01:25:12,325 --> 01:25:14,827
What I got to say, I say to the chief.

760
01:25:15,954 --> 01:25:18,706
It's about Sam Wood.

761
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:21,334
All right.

762
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:26,005
Yeah?

763
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,554
Purdy's out here, sir.
It's about Sam.

764
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:35,098
All right. Send him in.

765
01:25:46,234 --> 01:25:48,736
She is gonna have a baby.
Sam Wood's baby.

766
01:25:55,618 --> 01:25:58,121
Well, ask her yourself
if you don't believe me!

767
01:25:58,746 --> 01:26:01,207
What are you doin' here?

768
01:26:02,584 --> 01:26:05,587
It's important that I hear this.

769
01:26:09,173 --> 01:26:12,176
I ain't talkin' about this
with him in the room.

770
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:20,685
- Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!
- You be sensible. I'm a police officer.

771
01:26:23,605 --> 01:26:27,192
You gonna get him outta here,
or do I gotta do it?!

772
01:26:27,358 --> 01:26:31,404
You ain't gonna do nothin'.
You just stand there and shut up.

773
01:26:40,705 --> 01:26:42,749
Sit down, little girl.

774
01:26:46,544 --> 01:26:48,588
All right, now.

775
01:26:49,714 --> 01:26:54,427
You tell me... all about it.
Just tell me how it happened.

776
01:26:58,014 --> 01:27:00,141
Oh, come on. Come on, girl, speak!

777
01:27:00,266 --> 01:27:03,436
- Well, you know how hot it's been.
- Yeah.

778
01:27:03,561 --> 01:27:06,022
Nights, they aren't any better.

779
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:10,109
My brother works nights.

780
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,696
He leaves me all alone.

781
01:27:13,821 --> 01:27:16,824
This particular night,
I go out on the porch.

782
01:27:17,825 --> 01:27:21,704
I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be
if I had a fountain drink.

783
01:27:23,831 --> 01:27:26,292
Sam comes down our road.

784
01:27:27,168 --> 01:27:29,546
Just like he comes every night.

785
01:27:30,588 --> 01:27:34,968
Passin' like a lord
in that fine, big, shiny car.

786
01:27:38,054 --> 01:27:40,640
Only, this time he stops.

787
01:27:42,183 --> 01:27:45,812
He's got a nice face,
don't you think, Chief?

788
01:27:45,979 --> 01:27:47,772
So he stopped.

789
01:27:52,068 --> 01:27:55,071
- He says...
- What? I didn't hear what you said.

790
01:27:55,196 --> 01:27:57,240
He says...

791
01:27:58,658 --> 01:28:00,952
"Hey, little girl,

792
01:28:02,328 --> 01:28:05,164
you know what
the coolest spot in town is?"

793
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:10,879
And I said "No, Sam. I guess I don't. "

794
01:28:11,838 --> 01:28:16,050
And he said...
"The cemetery. That's where. "

795
01:28:17,427 --> 01:28:19,387
"Know why?"

796
01:28:21,222 --> 01:28:26,477
"Cos they got all of them
big, cool tombstones. "

797
01:28:26,644 --> 01:28:30,523
"Ever stretch out
on a tombstone, Delores?"

798
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:35,236
"Feel all that nice, cool marble
along your body?"

799
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:44,287
- He said that?
- You hear, Chief? You hear?

800
01:28:44,412 --> 01:28:46,456
Yeah, I hear. I hear.

801
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:52,212
All right. Sam comes along and stops in
front of your house and talks. What else?

802
01:28:52,712 --> 01:28:56,299
Well, come on now, girl.
What else? What else? What else?

803
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:00,720
- Then I went for a ride with him.
- Where'd you go?

804
01:29:00,845 --> 01:29:01,930
The cemetery.

805
01:29:02,055 --> 01:29:06,184
So, Wood took you to
the cemetery in the patrol car, right?

806
01:29:06,309 --> 01:29:09,979
And then things went a bit too far.
Is that what you're sayin'?

807
01:29:10,104 --> 01:29:12,315
Did they get a little bit outta line?

808
01:29:12,482 --> 01:29:15,318
Come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?

809
01:29:15,485 --> 01:29:17,529
Come on, girl! Is it or ain't it?

810
01:29:17,654 --> 01:29:20,323
- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!

811
01:29:21,074 --> 01:29:23,910
Now, I got one more question.
Very important.

812
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:26,829
Did he force you, or did you let him?

813
01:29:27,247 --> 01:29:30,667
Don't mean a damn whether
she let him or not! She is still 16!

814
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:33,795
In this state, that's rape!
I know the plain law on that!

815
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,799
I know the laws in the state
of Mississippi, thank you!

816
01:29:40,927 --> 01:29:43,847
- Are you sure you're pregnant?
- Yes, I am pregnant!

817
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:50,311
- Courtney!
- Yes, sir?

818
01:29:50,436 --> 01:29:53,523
Better get in here with a pad and a pencil.

819
01:29:58,736 --> 01:30:01,406
Come on in. I want you
to take this all down.

820
01:30:01,531 --> 01:30:05,660
You had no right to keep a nigger
in the room, shame my little sister.

821
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:10,206
You had no right.

822
01:30:12,166 --> 01:30:14,711
Virge, what's happenin'?

823
01:30:14,878 --> 01:30:16,170
- Hi, Harve.
- How are you?

824
01:30:16,337 --> 01:30:18,840
- Fine.
- Man, uh...

825
01:30:21,467 --> 01:30:26,181
- You sure saved my hide.
- Listen, Harvey. Man, uh...

826
01:30:28,474 --> 01:30:32,145
If a guy knocks up a girl in this town,
where can he go for help?

827
01:30:35,607 --> 01:30:38,359
- Barbershop.
- Barbershop?

828
01:30:38,943 --> 01:30:42,447
Borrow Mr Fanning's razor
and cut your throat!

829
01:30:43,281 --> 01:30:45,074
Well...

830
01:30:46,409 --> 01:30:49,245
But suppose
Mr Fanning's razor is too dull.

831
01:30:49,412 --> 01:30:52,999
Suppose he's got some
real money to spread around.

832
01:30:57,003 --> 01:30:59,047
Uh...

833
01:30:59,172 --> 01:31:00,965
Well, uh...

834
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:05,220
There used to be a coloured gal.

835
01:31:05,386 --> 01:31:11,059
But she kept bumpin' her price,
and I don't know if she's still in business.

836
01:31:11,226 --> 01:31:14,812
- What's her name?
- Well, I ain't never had to look her up.

837
01:31:16,272 --> 01:31:19,359
But, uh... Packy might know.

838
01:31:20,401 --> 01:31:22,862
Where do I find Packy?

839
01:31:23,571 --> 01:31:27,700
Down at the pool hall.
But, man, he wouldn't tell you.

840
01:31:28,284 --> 01:31:30,620
Not unless I say so.

841
01:31:30,787 --> 01:31:34,040
And how am I gonna say so
locked up in here?

842
01:31:34,374 --> 01:31:38,670
Suppose I get word to Packy that you
wanna see him? Have him come here?

843
01:31:42,006 --> 01:31:44,676
Will you let him
bring me a cheeseburger?

844
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:50,473
Onions?

845
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,851
Now you're talkin'!

846
01:31:53,935 --> 01:31:55,895
Uh... Virge?

847
01:32:49,115 --> 01:32:51,326
A little careless, ain't you, Virgil?

848
01:32:51,492 --> 01:32:56,456
Parked in the road, you could get yourself
killed. Anybody'd know where you are.

849
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:02,670
- You know what this land is?
- Yeah. It's the site for the new factory.

850
01:33:03,755 --> 01:33:09,344
I found a piece of wood in Colbert's scalp.
The lab identified it as pine.

851
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:14,057
Three people saw Colbert drive by -
alone - on the way back from Endicott's.

852
01:33:14,182 --> 01:33:18,895
Colbert must have picked up somebody
in town and then come out here.

853
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:21,856
I tell you he didn't pick up nobody.

854
01:33:21,981 --> 01:33:25,944
Sam followed him here, come up behind
him, just like I come up behind you.

855
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:29,739
- I heard you. Colbert would have too.
- He turned and he got smashed!

856
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:32,033
He was hit from behind!

857
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:35,495
If Delores Purdy hadn't come in,
I never would have seen the truth.

858
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:39,207
I was hung up trying to get Endicott,
for personal reasons.

859
01:33:39,749 --> 01:33:41,876
Do you know what I'm gonna do, Virgil?

860
01:33:42,043 --> 01:33:45,380
I'm gonna take you to Brownsville
and put you on the bus myself.

861
01:33:45,505 --> 01:33:49,175
You aren't taking me anywhere.
You dig? You're holding the wrong man!

862
01:33:49,342 --> 01:33:54,222
The wrong man?! I got the motive, which
is money, and the body, which is dead!

863
01:33:54,347 --> 01:33:56,683
- What makes you so sure?
- Why do you doubt it?!

864
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:59,143
Because Colbert was killed here!

865
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:02,564
Then driven back to town in his own car
and dumped on the streets.

866
01:34:02,689 --> 01:34:05,441
Sam couldn't have driven two cars!

867
01:34:35,221 --> 01:34:37,265
What do you want?

868
01:34:40,059 --> 01:34:42,270
Give me till morning.

869
01:35:25,021 --> 01:35:27,273
You know...

870
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:31,027
You know, Virgil,
you are among the chosen few.

871
01:35:33,696 --> 01:35:35,823
How's that?

872
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:40,954
Well, I think that you're the first
human being that's ever been in here.

873
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:48,795
Well, you can't be too careful, man.

874
01:35:52,298 --> 01:35:54,801
You know a lotta things, don't you?

875
01:35:55,927 --> 01:35:59,013
Well, just what do you know
about insomnia?

876
01:36:04,394 --> 01:36:06,104
Bourbon can't cure it.

877
01:36:10,775 --> 01:36:13,236
Well... that's for sure.

878
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:18,324
Now look. I got no wife. I got no kids.

879
01:36:19,284 --> 01:36:24,414
Boy, I got a town that... don't want me.

880
01:36:29,168 --> 01:36:32,755
And I got an air conditioner
that I have to oil myself,

881
01:36:33,631 --> 01:36:36,885
and a desk with a busted leg.
And on top of that, I got...

882
01:36:38,678 --> 01:36:40,471
this, uh...

883
01:36:41,681 --> 01:36:43,808
place.

884
01:36:43,933 --> 01:36:47,604
Now, don't you think that'd
drive a man to takin' a few drinks?

885
01:36:55,403 --> 01:36:58,239
I'll tell you a secret.

886
01:36:58,406 --> 01:37:00,450
Nobody comes here.

887
01:37:02,327 --> 01:37:04,120
Never.

888
01:37:14,589 --> 01:37:16,716
You married?

889
01:37:18,134 --> 01:37:19,928
No.

890
01:37:21,429 --> 01:37:23,473
Ever been?

891
01:37:25,683 --> 01:37:27,477
No.

892
01:37:31,606 --> 01:37:34,067
Ever been close to it?

893
01:37:47,038 --> 01:37:49,582
Close to it.

894
01:37:54,295 --> 01:37:59,342
Don't you get just... a little lonely?

895
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:08,184
No lonelier than you, man.

896
01:38:13,523 --> 01:38:16,776
Oh, now, don't get smart, black boy.

897
01:38:19,737 --> 01:38:22,240
I don't need it.

898
01:38:27,704 --> 01:38:30,039
No pity, thank you.

899
01:38:34,794 --> 01:38:36,838
No, thank you!

900
01:38:45,138 --> 01:38:46,306
- Yeah?
- Chief?

901
01:38:46,431 --> 01:38:50,351
- Yeah.
- You know where I can find Virgil?

902
01:38:50,518 --> 01:38:52,395
Who are you?

903
01:38:52,562 --> 01:38:56,941
Packy, Chief. Packy Harrison.
I'm a friend of Harve.

904
01:39:00,069 --> 01:39:03,406
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

905
01:39:03,531 --> 01:39:06,618
- Where you goin'?
- Where whitey ain't allowed.

906
01:39:07,493 --> 01:39:11,706
- What the hell does that mean?
- You gave me till morning. Remember?

907
01:39:44,739 --> 01:39:48,618
- Here's the car.
- He could have exchanged cars by now.

908
01:39:48,785 --> 01:39:51,788
John, you stick here. We'll keep cruisin'.

909
01:40:01,839 --> 01:40:04,759
You find him,
come back for me, you hear?

910
01:40:08,513 --> 01:40:12,016
That's her place, here.
You want me to wait?

911
01:40:12,892 --> 01:40:16,563
No, thank you, Packy. You go on home.

912
01:40:59,522 --> 01:41:01,482
Mrs Bellamy?

913
01:41:02,192 --> 01:41:05,028
People around here
call me Mama Caleba.

914
01:41:05,445 --> 01:41:09,741
Mama, I'm not from around here.
But you can put me on my train.

915
01:41:10,366 --> 01:41:13,953
You talk crazy. You gin-drunk?

916
01:41:15,246 --> 01:41:17,790
Just homesick.

917
01:41:18,666 --> 01:41:20,627
Lord, Lord!

918
01:41:20,793 --> 01:41:24,297
Whisper two little words,
Mama, and I'm on my way.

919
01:41:24,464 --> 01:41:30,553
Maybe... I don't want to sever
a beautiful child like you right out.

920
01:41:37,852 --> 01:41:39,896
A man's name.

921
01:41:43,942 --> 01:41:45,985
First name, last name.

922
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:50,657
The man who's paying you
for Delores Purdy's abortion.

923
01:41:50,782 --> 01:41:53,284
You're the boy who works for Mr Charlie.

924
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,747
I thought that's who you was.

925
01:41:58,957 --> 01:42:01,417
Why you wanna do that?

926
01:42:02,877 --> 01:42:06,047
Why you wanna help the police like that?

927
01:42:06,172 --> 01:42:09,008
They stealin' your soul.

928
01:42:09,175 --> 01:42:12,428
They chew you up and spit you out.

929
01:42:12,554 --> 01:42:15,056
I'm not here to lay a finger on you, Mama.

930
01:42:17,141 --> 01:42:19,352
It's the white boy I want.

931
01:42:19,477 --> 01:42:21,938
What you got against him?
He's paying for his fun.

932
01:42:22,063 --> 01:42:25,400
How much? I bet you he's not
paying you more than a hundred.

933
01:42:25,984 --> 01:42:30,196
You know how much he's got in
his pocket right now? More than $600!

934
01:42:31,155 --> 01:42:34,325
That cracker?

935
01:42:34,492 --> 01:42:38,621
- Where'd he come off getting 600?
- He killed Mr Colbert.

936
01:42:41,833 --> 01:42:43,960
You gone crazy out of your mind.

937
01:42:44,085 --> 01:42:46,921
Now listen. Hear me good, Mama, please.

938
01:42:47,088 --> 01:42:49,465
Don't make me have to send you to jail.

939
01:42:50,675 --> 01:42:52,135
A lot you care!

940
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:56,014
There's white time in jail, and
coloured time. The worst kind you can do

941
01:42:56,181 --> 01:42:57,891
is coloured time.

942
01:43:01,352 --> 01:43:04,689
Child... you promise...

943
01:43:06,524 --> 01:43:09,194
give me understanding.

944
01:43:09,986 --> 01:43:12,405
I got used to better.

945
01:43:13,323 --> 01:43:15,992
You won't take it away?

946
01:43:18,578 --> 01:43:20,622
I won't take it away.

947
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:26,794
Well... I don't know his name.

948
01:43:27,712 --> 01:43:31,049
But she's coming here tonight.

949
01:43:31,466 --> 01:43:33,510
Get herself straight.

950
01:43:49,567 --> 01:43:52,403
- Leave me alone! Let me go!
- Let go of her!

951
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:56,366
- Let go of her!
- Let go of me!

952
01:43:59,911 --> 01:44:02,372
Gonna teach you, boy!

953
01:44:02,956 --> 01:44:04,999
No club this time, man?

954
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:09,963
A gun's not smart. The way
you killed Colbert was much smarter.

955
01:44:11,047 --> 01:44:13,174
You killed Colbert?!

956
01:44:13,299 --> 01:44:16,219
He's crazy. Crazy.

957
01:44:38,783 --> 01:44:41,953
OK, nigger. Your time, nigger.

958
01:44:42,328 --> 01:44:44,372
Look in her purse.

959
01:44:45,331 --> 01:44:48,668
- What's that mean?
- She's got $100 to pay for an abortion.

960
01:44:48,835 --> 01:44:51,087
Listen to that. That's crazy.

961
01:44:51,254 --> 01:44:54,007
Money she got from Ralph.

962
01:44:54,424 --> 01:44:56,551
You gonna listen to him?

963
01:44:56,676 --> 01:44:59,512
He got her to tell you
that Sam Wood did it.

964
01:45:00,221 --> 01:45:02,807
He made a fool out of you, Purdy.

965
01:45:04,559 --> 01:45:07,020
- Delores?
- Liar!

966
01:45:07,645 --> 01:45:10,815
You stinkin' liar!

967
01:45:10,982 --> 01:45:13,026
Gimme that purse!

968
01:45:26,497 --> 01:45:31,461
You turned my little sister...
into a field slut?

969
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:36,716
Lloyd! Lloyd!

970
01:45:36,883 --> 01:45:39,719
- Hey, man, stay back!
- He's got a gun!

971
01:45:42,138 --> 01:45:44,182
He's dead.

972
01:45:56,444 --> 01:45:58,905
When I left her house,
I was going to the diner.

973
01:45:59,072 --> 01:46:02,158
Mr Colbert drove by,
so I hitched a ride with him. That's all.

974
01:46:02,283 --> 01:46:06,079
I said "I sure would like a job in
that new factory once you get started. "

975
01:46:06,246 --> 01:46:10,625
And he said "Sure. " And I said
"Well, I wonder where it's gonna be. "

976
01:46:10,792 --> 01:46:15,588
He said that field we were comin' up to
was it, and he would stop and show me.

977
01:46:16,256 --> 01:46:19,092
I said to myself "Man, he's askin' for it. "

978
01:46:19,759 --> 01:46:23,429
I said "Now, Ralph,
all you gotta do when we get out...

979
01:46:24,597 --> 01:46:29,060
is just sneak up behind him
and just... tap him. "

980
01:46:30,186 --> 01:46:34,315
"And then just claim that somebody
jumped us from the bushes. "

981
01:46:39,487 --> 01:46:41,531
That's all.

982
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:45,201
I didn't mean to kill him.

983
01:46:50,665 --> 01:46:52,542
Yeah.

984
01:46:52,667 --> 01:46:55,169
All right, Courtney. That's enough.

985
01:47:06,097 --> 01:47:08,683
All right. C'mon, Ralph.

986
01:47:22,197 --> 01:47:24,324
That's all.

987
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:27,911
I didn't mean to kill him.

988
01:48:11,538 --> 01:48:14,040
Well, got your ticket?

989
01:48:14,916 --> 01:48:16,960
Here you are.

990
01:48:18,336 --> 01:48:20,380
Thank you.

991
01:48:21,756 --> 01:48:23,800
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

992
01:48:29,389 --> 01:48:31,432
Virgil?

993
01:48:35,770 --> 01:48:38,857
You take care. You hear?

994
01:48:43,736 --> 01:48:45,196
Yeah.

995
01:48:54,914 --> 01:48:56,958
Board!

996
01:49:00,128 --> 01:49:04,757
<i>In the heat of the night</i>

997
01:49:08,469 --> 01:49:13,433
<i>I've got trouble wall to wall</i>

998
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:17,270
<i>Oh yes, I have</i>

999
01:49:17,395 --> 01:49:19,522
<i>I repeat</i>

1000
01:49:19,647 --> 01:49:22,108
<i>I repeat, in the night</i>

1001
01:49:24,569 --> 01:49:29,616
<i>Must be an endin' to it all</i>

1002
01:49:33,453 --> 01:49:38,333
<i>Hold on, it won't be long</i>

1003
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:41,502
<i>Yeah, you be strong</i>

1004
01:49:41,669 --> 01:49:44,047
<i>And I'll be all right</i>

1005
01:49:44,172 --> 01:49:47,592
