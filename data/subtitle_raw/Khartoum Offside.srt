1
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:10,199
Under the current Islamic military regime,
women are not allowed to play soccer

2
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:14,999
in Sudan. And we also can't
make movies, but...

3
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:20,199
Marwa, I want to play in the women's cup
for the Sudanese national team!

4
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:27,533
Khartoum Offside

5
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,799
<i>"What does love
has to do with me?

6
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,666
<i>I called...
He never answered or called me back...</i>

7
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:52,966
<i>I called...
He never answered or called me back...</i>

8
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,333
<i>He was cruel and complained</i>

9
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,066
<i>He came, he distracted me
and then forgot me...</i>

10
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:03,966
<i>"What does love
has to do with me?

11
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:14,333
<I love you
with every bit of me

12
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:17,633
<i>Your love is the world to me</i>

13
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:20,933
<I love you
with every bit of me

14
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,799
<i>Your love is the world to me</i>

15
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:31,599
<i>I think about him, then I forget.
My hopes rise again...</i>

16
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,833
<i>What does love
has to do with me?</i>

17
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:43,933
They screwed you.
This is old.

18
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,999
One day,
I'm playing goalie...

19
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,466
And I didn't know
that my uncle was there.

20
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:53,933
The ball is coming
towards me...

21
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,833
I look up
and I see my uncle arriving.

22
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,566
I step away from the goal
and sit down next to him.

23
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,933
My teammates shout:
"Hinda! Get back in the goal!"

24
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:12,833
I pretend not to hear them,
"Hinda! The goal!"

25
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,733
I wanted my uncle to think
that I was just watching,

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,999
but they ruined
my plan.

27
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,499
My uncle shows up,
beats me and drags me home,

28
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:24,399
and the ball flies
into our goal.

29
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:44,866
Good boy,
you didn't go out with your mother...

30
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,133
Don't know your
of your mother?

31
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,233
129...

32
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:53,533
You didn't call her?

33
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,533
I tried

34
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,166
The cell phone
is not working.

35
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,466
May God forgive her...

36
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,166
Lord Almighty!

37
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,299
Her phone
is out of service.

38
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:13,799
Listen...

39
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:21,333
Tell her I stopped by
and to call me

40
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:26,166
I should receive the rent
by tonight.

41
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,466
I am very sleepy.

42
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,533
I was born an orphan.
I grew up in my grandmother's house.

43
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:53,166
It came from my grandfather. He had
four wives and many children.

44
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:59,599
He always heard stories about his inheritance
and the problems of the house...

45
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,666
Then I decided that one day
I would have my own home...

46
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,966
with my own money.

47
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:30,166
- What should I talk about? My life? My youth?
- Tell me about your youth.

48
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:38,632
<If only my lost youth
could come back again</i>

49
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:43,666
<i>One and again, my love</i>

50
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:49,766
<i>Until the moment, my love</i>

51
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:56,499
<i>I never forgot you
and you never forgot me

52
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,032
My grandfather Ernest Jubara

53
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,166
Atlabara...

54
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:15,832
He owned the well-known Baka mill,
in the south, in Atlabara.

55
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:19,799
This mill
was from the time of the English...

56
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:25,999
They called it the mill,
after the English left.

57
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,499
Originally, it was a bar.
A huge bar.

58
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,299
Where people drank,
enjoyed life.

59
00:06:33,366 --> 00:06:35,099
And other things!

60
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:38,699
During the Second War
I think.

61
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:42,699
These are my mother's stories,
as if she were there...

62
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:49,466
In World War II, the customers
put up fights, I don't know how...

63
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:52,999
But there were deaths
in that bar.

64
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:59,832
My family even today
has nightmares about it

65
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:03,199
I would like to bring
that bar back...

66
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,866
- Does your family still have the bar?
- Yes.

67
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:10,099
I will open another one,
of my own.

68
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,832
Sasa Jabara!

69
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,099
I'm going to call
Sasa Jabara's Bar!

70
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:20,299
40 lashes.

71
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:24,099
You stand up,
dust off your ass...

72
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,432
Do some ice compresses
to reduce the swelling.

73
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:30,932
That's it.

74
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,466
But why drink in the streets,
be arrested and receive 40 lashes?

75
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:42,099
Drink where they can't arrest you,
at home, and go to sleep without the lash

76
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:45,366
-Why do you drink anyway?
-Do you want to paint the city red?

77
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,699
I'm not going to serve whiskey
or anything like that.

78
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:53,499
I will serve <i>Kaji moror</i>,
the local <i>hooch</i> and <i>Abyad damira</i>.

79
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,532
- What do you call the one with ginger?
-<i>Atbaga.</i>

80
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:14,766
<i>Don't dry your clothes
indoors...</i>

81
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:23,799
I was born in the south,
but I grew up in the north.

82
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:29,699
My people did not believe
that secession would actually happen...

83
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,866
Neither do I.

84
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,699
But it happened.

85
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,399
The South became
another country.

86
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:44,066
My parents became
 from two different countries.

87
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:48,699
I did not vote for
for secession.

88
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,532
I didn't even vote.

89
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:54,666
Because I was not convinced.

90
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:10,632
My parents were not against
me playing soccer.

91
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:15,299
They thought,
where will sport take you?

92
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:20,199
We didn't see any progress,
and I could never represent Sudan.

93
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:34,032
Hi, Coach.
How are you?

94
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,766
<i>Where have you been, Sara?</i>

95
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,432
I was tired, Coach.

96
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:47,332
<i>We want the activity to take off,
because you already have the money.

97
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:53,932
<i>the money that comes from FIFA
for our Federation.

98
00:09:54,266 --> 00:10:02,632
<i>You need an office,
or come stay here with us in the federation.</i>

99
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:10,432
<i>In any case, Sara,
we're talking about years of work.

100
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:15,766
We don't want to waste energy,
and the girls are disappointed.

101
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:19,066
Because they don't have a chance
to play abroad.

102
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:27,466
<i>As you have an activity,
I will log it and send it to FIFA.

103
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:35,732
<i>We only have one field for women,
so people don't talk bad about us.

104
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:07,199
Salma stay with the group!
Don't move alone!

105
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:13,565
It is closed!

106
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:14,899
It is closed!

107
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:16,199
Go on, play!

108
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,899
Keep the ball!

109
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,799
Keep the ball!

110
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:48,399
Don't just stand there!

111
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:57,499
Speak up if you haven't paid yet
and pass it on.

112
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,365
I am behind on my rent,
but we have to pay.

113
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,032
Sunday then.

114
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,499
Saturday also
can we pay?

115
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:11,232
I just paid.

116
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,732
And the rest?

117
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:21,965
- Money is tight. How could it be?
- There were many of us, but several left.

118
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:30,099
We were counting on more people
to pay the rent.

119
00:12:30,165 --> 00:12:35,865
They should say at the beginning,
whether or not they want to continue playing.

120
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:39,165
Now you don't have
enough money.

121
00:13:41,565 --> 00:13:43,799
- Are you done yet?
- Not yet.

122
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:03,299
They asked for some tests
to renew my residence permit.

123
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:09,632
I had to take tests
for hepatitis and HIV.

124
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:15,432
They confiscated my passport
until the results came out.

125
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:21,432
If the results are not good,
they will not renew my residency.

126
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,799
What counts
as cleanliness and hygiene.

127
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:31,932
See that trash over there?
I'll clean it up.

128
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,365
I can work on Sunday.

129
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:38,232
You will open the store...

130
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:43,165
I'm going to take some sand
and throw it in that trash.

131
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:48,699
We will call you
around 11:00 or 12:00.

132
00:15:53,832 --> 00:15:58,099
So you check
if we can rent the place.

133
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,999
There is another coffee shop nearby...

134
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,499
With a TV,
soccer channels...

135
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:08,032
They serve <i>shisha</i> and snacks...

136
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,932
In a better place.

137
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:15,165
The rent is a thousand a month.
Let's take a look.

138
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:19,899
This is a small place,
as the guy said.

139
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:23,299
And it comes with a partnership...

140
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:26,599
Then the profit
will be almost none.

141
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,132
There are no inspections here,
right?

142
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,932
Yes, you have to have good relations with the government.
with the government.

143
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:47,698
So they call
and let you know if there will be a raid...

144
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:52,565
But you have to pay,
of course you have to pay.

145
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:55,298
There is a fine of 2,000 pounds
for serving shisha.

146
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:56,665
Not for alcohol.

147
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:58,465
The fine for shisha
is one thousand...

148
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:02,798
Sara, let's get into
into the drug business...

149
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:39,332
I remember the game
of the old Barcelona team

150
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:40,465
Against Zidane.

151
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,532
Ronaldo, the Brazilian...

152
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:43,665
Roberto Carlos

153
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,032
and that Portuguese player...

154
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:50,732
Luis Figo!

155
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:55,032
It was the best team
of Real Madrid...

156
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:08,465
Here we go!

157
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,898
- A great save by the goalkeeper!
- It's the best

158
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:28,332
Barcelona has a problem, keeping
possession of the ball is no longer the best tactic.

159
00:18:28,865 --> 00:18:30,965
Take a look
at Bayern Munich's team...

160
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,832
They scored five goals
against Arsenal!

161
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:36,832
In the same week
they beat Barcelona.

162
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,365
Is the court open?

163
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:39,165
I'm already full in front...

164
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:45,565
Sara has things
everywhere.

165
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:51,565
What's wrong with these things?
They are OK.

166
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,632
I don't have any.
They need to fill my things...

167
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:56,832
-But why mine?
-No, you're fine like this.

168
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:03,898
This ball is nice. I will take it
it to the children back home.

169
00:20:05,032 --> 00:20:07,398
Not a dream!

170
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:11,898
Play with one touch.
That's it. Cool!

171
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:21,232
Good... very good!

172
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:23,598
Well done!

173
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:02,898
Asthma, your passes
are wrong, wow!

174
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:09,665
The man who trains you,
what is his name?

175
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:10,832
Coach Abduh.

176
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:13,365
- Coach.
- Coach.

177
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:14,665
Practice...

178
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:17,832
Coach.

179
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:26,732
He said it's only for adults
and that I'm too small.

180
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:29,798
I am ten years old!

181
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:31,732
I am quite tall.

182
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:35,365
So,
we are not the same height.

183
00:21:37,032 --> 00:21:38,032
Right?

184
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,298
Sit down, sit down...

185
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:46,798
I can handle
anything...

186
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:48,498
I have a strong body.

187
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,332
Do you know how hard the ball
is hard?

188
00:21:51,765 --> 00:21:57,098
I kicked with my toes
until I couldn't stand it, but I didn't cry.

189
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:58,565
Didn't you cry?

190
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:00,765
-No...
-Because you love soccer!

191
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:02,798
I love it!
More than anything!

192
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:09,232
I can't wear a veil in the field.
It gets in the way.

193
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:13,398
See that girl?
She's not wearing the veil...

194
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:19,165
Stupid girl. Your head
is backwards...

195
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:22,998
These are our customs
and traditions, girl.

196
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:24,365
Your customs and traditions?

197
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:25,231
Yes!

198
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:28,531
So someone who doesn't wear a veil
has a screw loose?

199
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:29,631
Yes!

200
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:31,565
So Marwa and I
are stupid?

201
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:35,431
Stupid! Stupid!
More than stupid!

202
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:38,065
I'm not going to get married.
But I will have children.

203
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,065
- But what?
- I'm going to have children.

204
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,298
How are you going to do it
without getting married?

205
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:44,631
Then,
shouldn't you have children?

206
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:48,131
The children don't show up
at the door of the house!

207
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:55,531
Then I'll put on makeup,
fix my hair...

208
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:59,865
and do these things
to impress men!

209
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,498
I was on my way to pay
some utility bills...

210
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:16,531
When I passed the soldiers
at the door.

211
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:22,531
My veil was on my shoulder
and I was in a ponytail.

212
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:27,598
A soldier says:
"Is it a girl or a boy?".

213
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:31,498
He would speak:
"Boy or girl? Boy or girl?"

214
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:35,131
I heard "A boy",
and it made me sad.

215
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,398
The other guy said:
"Hey girl!"

216
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:38,631
I pretended not to hear.

217
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:41,198
I kept walking
and he came after me...

218
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:43,231
And he said
"Hey, I'm talking to you!"

219
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:44,698
I said:
"I get it."

220
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:46,865
"Cover your head!"

221
00:24:46,898 --> 00:24:49,765
I said, "You can't even tell
if I'm a girl or a boy!"

222
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:51,798
Make up your mind
and then we'll talk.

223
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:54,698
The first policeman says:
"What's going on?"

224
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:58,398
I said: "The soldiers kept
asking "girl or boy?

225
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:02,131
The whole problem
started with "boy or girl?"

226
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:11,165
Republic of Sudan:
*Basic Education Curriculum*

227
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:21,765
Turkish-Egyptian rule
over Sudan ended in 1885.

228
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:25,298
The Mahdist state began...

229
00:27:25,298 --> 00:27:27,765
Omdurman became
the capital of Mahdia...

230
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:29,898
And they passed
Islamic Sharia law.

231
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:32,165
The causes of the colonization
of Sudan...

232
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:36,865
The internal affairs of the Mahdist state
have become vulnerable.

233
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:41,365
Colonialist activity in eastern Sudan and Africa
Sudan and Africa continue...

234
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:47,398
The British occupied Uganda
and the west-south Sudan.

235
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:50,798
Italy occupied Eritrea
and Kassala, Eastern Sudan.

236
00:27:57,864 --> 00:28:01,131
Why is Sudan part
the Arab League?

237
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:06,731
Girl, we are an African country
and not Arab!

238
00:28:07,098 --> 00:28:10,398
Addis Ababa and Uganda
are Africans.

239
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:12,598
How can Sudan
be Arab?

240
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:17,798
We are a Muslim state, maybe...
Ethiopia has Muslims too.

241
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,831
All this has changed so that they can
apply their policies...

242
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,731
But we are not Arabs.
If you go to Saudi Arabia

243
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:25,964
they will say you are
are not Arab...

244
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:42,831
In the past, I was attacked
secretly in the field...

245
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:50,098
Sukra and Faniya would come up
and hit me...

246
00:28:50,464 --> 00:28:53,098
My leg would get swollen
after playing with them...

247
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,298
They would knock me down.

248
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:59,931
I looked around
and saw Sara in the distance...

249
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:09,464
In Japan, I took the European
for a trainer's license.

250
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:16,098
The exercise was about
the ice-sliding technique.

251
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:18,331
They were instructing the players
on how to slide.

252
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,031
- They should know, sliding is up to them...
- She was the last player...

253
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:29,531
The coach passed the ball,
the goalkeeper came out of the goal and I slid in.

254
00:29:29,931 --> 00:29:33,831
I said:
"Hey, be careful, I'm from Africa."

255
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:36,831
My slip made
the dew to splash...

256
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:41,731
I remembered Captain Maged,
the dew splash was beautiful!

257
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:47,164
I lifted the ball
and kicked it into the goal!

258
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:51,431
The people applauded
like crazy!

259
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,764
The trainer said:
"Do you know how to do that?"

260
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:59,831
"Sure," I said.
"One of my favorite things!"

261
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,331
The back of her leg
turned black after the slide.

262
00:30:03,664 --> 00:30:06,864
I heard this story
from one of the men's teams.

263
00:30:09,031 --> 00:30:12,098
One of the national teams
national team...

264
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:18,698
They had a gynecologist
with them.

265
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:29,898
The federation asks us
to cover our legs...

266
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:34,931
They said, "Girls can't wear shorts.
can't wear shorts.

267
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:38,798
"What's the problem?
My girls are skinny!"

268
00:30:38,931 --> 00:30:41,798
They were worried
that an officer would show up.

269
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:44,131
I said:
"You guys are really weird..."

270
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:49,264
This is a soccer uniform!
 uniform!

271
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:54,164
But we agreed that,
if a religious official would come,

272
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,731
out of respect, because you are a
mentally disturbed person,

273
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:00,831
the girls would wear
long sweatpants.

274
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:03,398
But if a FIFA official
of FIFA comes,

275
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:05,398
why should we wear
workout clothes?

276
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,831
The game has rules!

277
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:12,398
They can't understand,
what can I do?

278
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:16,564
The veil slips,
while you are running...

279
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:20,731
You straighten it out
as the ball enters the goal!

280
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:22,998
This is absurd.

281
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:26,664
Am I here to keep my head covered
or to play?

282
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,331
How is a national
a national team?

283
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:34,731
You must take care
 the teams you already have...

284
00:31:35,064 --> 00:31:39,564
Start with them
and then bring in the other generation.

285
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,198
whether they win or lose,
it doesn't matter.

286
00:31:43,664 --> 00:31:47,131
You have a
women's national team....

287
00:31:47,931 --> 00:31:50,131
Sudan should have
a national team...

288
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,964
It should be us,
shouldn't we?

289
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:13,164
We are talking about our position
in the federation...

290
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:18,431
If something happens,
does the federation protect these girls?

291
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,664
They play,
but they are not organized,

292
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:24,531
and they have no support
or money...

293
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:28,564
You have to have money,
a committee and a headquarters...

294
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:34,764
You need to have 8 teams
to have competitions during the year...

295
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:36,998
Not just random departures...

296
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:40,431
There are also teams
in the provinces.

297
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:44,431
Yes, true,
Niala has a team...

298
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,131
And there is another one in Madani.

299
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,064
But to organize them,
you need a committee!

300
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:54,064
The activity takes place in groups of five,
since we don't play 11 against 11.

301
00:32:54,364 --> 00:32:59,698
As I said, there will be a
development budget for you...

302
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:10,164
After the elections, comes a FIFA grant
for development...

303
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,897
You have wasted
many chances, girls.

304
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:49,897
I like women's soccer...

305
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:57,164
I stopped working with the guys
and now I train with them.

306
00:35:57,564 --> 00:36:01,331
Even if Bakhita can't come to the training,
I will go alone.

307
00:36:02,097 --> 00:36:05,564
None of them ever said
an unkind word to me.

308
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,231
Just pretty words?

309
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,297
That Sara!

310
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:20,597
If I could represent South Sudan,
I would put here two tennis balls...

311
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:25,764
Under a bra,
and she would be a pretty girl, ah yes!

312
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:30,497
When my son
turns two,

313
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:33,431
I will bring it to your court,

314
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:37,031
and I will say:
"Your father got a good start here!"

315
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:40,664
"The bum you see
started right here!"

316
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:45,064
The father saw Monot leaving the house
and asked

317
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:48,031
"Where are you going?" Monot said:
"I'm working with Sara."

318
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:49,631
Then my father sees me leaving...

319
00:36:50,397 --> 00:36:52,764
Question: "Is Monot playing
with your team?".

320
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:54,464
I said:
"Yes, on the girls' team..."

321
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,997
"We have other guys
on the team, too.

322
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:00,997
He says, "Okay.
Do you guys play with them normally?"

323
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:02,031
I say, "Of course!"

324
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:07,131
The problem is this stupid Sudan,
where there is no progress.

325
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:16,864
Why can't you play abroad
like the Sudanese National Team?

326
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:22,364
So that they know their names.
They don't support...

327
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:28,664
I will draft some documents,
with official stamps...

328
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:34,864
We will create a team
with all the documents...

329
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:39,897
So we can receive invitations
from abroad directly...

330
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:43,464
An official team...

331
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:50,231
Because the Federation, God bless it,
is not to be trusted...

332
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:52,964
They refuse to guarantee
any of our rights...

333
00:37:53,164 --> 00:37:56,497
They agree in words,
but do nothing.

334
00:37:56,697 --> 00:37:59,864
They keep promising,
but nothing happens.

335
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,731
If we could travel abroad,
we wouldn't have any problems.

336
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:09,231
But how can we travel
and play as a team? How...?

337
00:38:41,131 --> 00:38:44,497
We made many journeys
and departures together...

338
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,330
Not everyone in this team
are from the south...

339
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:01,364
We are from the mountains
of Nuba...

340
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,130
It is really beautiful there.

341
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:09,564
He asked
where we were originally from?

342
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:16,864
Many fled to Khartoum
because of the wars.

343
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:30,264
No one ever imagined
that Sudan would split in two...

344
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,330
Ultimately,
I am Sudanese.

345
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:16,797
<i>The creation of a women's team has been presented
 to the Organization of Islamic Jurisprudence....</i>

346
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:26,430
<i>That is the authority of the Islamic government
On Shariah Law. It decreed:</i>

347
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:32,130
<i>"The only sports allowed
for women are those that maintain health."

348
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:36,397
<i>Football is for men
and inappropriate for women...</i>

349
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:41,097
<We must warn against everything
that may cause</i>

350
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:44,497
<i>the abolition of the differences
between men and women...</i>

351
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:51,897
<i>The practice of this sport diverts women
from their feminine nature and incites violent instincts...</i>

352
00:40:54,597 --> 00:41:03,397
<i>But the sport in question
involves creating a women's soccer team...</i>

353
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,930
<i>to play in the Sudan Cup.</i>

354
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:10,730
<i>Also, to play abroad,
in Europe, in the U.S. and Africa...</i>

355
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:14,564
"Investigation: whose fault is it?
Women play soccer with men in the streets!"

356
00:41:14,664 --> 00:41:19,264
<i>So we decided against the creation
of a women's soccer league.</i>

357
00:41:19,264 --> 00:41:20,530
<i>Holy be the Lord!</i>

358
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:24,464
My father said that Friday's
on Friday was about us...

359
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,997
They said "sinful!"
"Shameful!"...the usual.

360
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,030
The newspapers talked
about our departure...

361
00:42:32,397 --> 00:42:35,030
A stranger knocked
at my door...

362
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:39,997
I told my parents ,
"I feel you will have a summons."

363
00:42:40,264 --> 00:42:43,597
I opened the door and a man asked,
"Are you Hala?"

364
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,030
"Yes," I said.

365
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:49,197
"You should go to the Department
of State Security." I asked why.

366
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,030
He said
"Because of soccer."

367
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:57,330
They asked, "Who invited you
to the game? Who are the others?"

368
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,530
At first, I denied everything,
of course!

369
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:11,830
He said, "It is a sin! It's not right to play
with boys in the street!"

370
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:15,430
I said,
"Yes, I play in the street."

371
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:17,497
"What about your father?"
he asked.

372
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,630
"You don't have any
problem with that."

373
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:21,130
They asked the same questions
to Asthma.

374
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:27,497
Asma said: "I play soccer
wherever possible".

375
00:43:27,797 --> 00:43:30,297
They asked: "Where do you live?
"On the May block," she said.

376
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,430
"Where exactly?"

377
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:32,930
"In Hayy al-Arab..."

378
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:38,397
And so on,
one question after another...

379
00:43:38,797 --> 00:43:41,830
When it was over,
the police cleared everything up.

380
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,697
The police had
received instructions

381
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:48,197
to learn the identity of the girls
who played that match...

382
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:51,430
find out where they live,
summon them...

383
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,330
and question them.

384
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:07,630
Okay, finishing up the work,
we'll meet there.

385
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,130
I should move
from Koubar, so...

386
00:44:18,297 --> 00:44:20,564
Come on,
let me wash my face...

387
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:51,263
Are you going out
or are you staying home?

388
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:55,463
We will probably pass
past you...

389
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:58,597
Yesterday I went...

390
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,597
Renew my residence permit
residence permit...

391
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:05,830
They force you to take tests
for AIDS and Hepatitis C...

392
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,497
I went to get the results
and was told I had to do it again...

393
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,663
- Do what again?
- The blood tests.

394
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,130
- Again?
- Yes

395
00:45:14,263 --> 00:45:17,630
-For how much?
250 pounds...

396
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:25,763
Only the two Southern
had to redo the tests.

397
00:45:25,797 --> 00:45:27,830
All the others
have achieved renewal.

398
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,330
This sucks!

399
00:45:36,397 --> 00:45:38,497
Why do they do this?

400
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:56,330
If it goes wrong,
what will you do?

401
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,363
I'll think about that later...

402
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:46,563
It's strange when you ask "why" and they answer "that's the way it is.
and they answer "that's the way it is".

403
00:46:46,697 --> 00:46:50,063
What does this mean?

404
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,330
Give me a reason...

405
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,663
For starters:
why can't we play abroad?

406
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,697
We ask the people
of the federation.

407
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,497
We don't receive invitations to play
abroad? Not really!

408
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:06,930
The Arab Women's
of Women's Football was in Egypt...

409
00:47:06,997 --> 00:47:08,630
They said we could go...

410
00:47:08,697 --> 00:47:11,797
We pack our bags
and our hopes...

411
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:14,563
They canceled our trip
to Egypt, next door...

412
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:19,030
When you play abroad,
you realize your true level.

413
00:47:19,297 --> 00:47:21,897
When you compete with people
better than you...

414
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,630
That is important.

415
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,897
Do you want me to read
her future?

416
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:44,263
-Her future or yours?
-Mine...

417
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:04,930
What is your plan?

418
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:07,763
I plan to travel...

419
00:48:10,163 --> 00:48:11,163
Near or far?

420
00:48:11,697 --> 00:48:12,697
Out of Sudan.

421
00:48:12,797 --> 00:48:16,230
Okay, now put one
in each row.

422
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:40,330
He has some projects,
but nothing clear yet...

423
00:48:44,663 --> 00:48:46,863
Here's a trip...

424
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:49,763
You will travel...

425
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:50,863
But not now...

426
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,530
Coming soon.

427
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:31,763
I have to tell you
the news...

428
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:36,497
Aisha was nominated for the elections
of the Federal Soccer Council.

429
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,697
<i>I knew she would be...</i>

430
00:49:41,297 --> 00:49:43,863
She is a candidate!
Can you believe it?

431
00:49:43,997 --> 00:49:48,963
Aisha and Hanan
from the Al Mawrada club

432
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,997
She is candidate number 2...

433
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,297
The third is Nahid.

434
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:58,197
Nahid,
she is a journalist.

435
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,330
<i>Yes, I met her...</i>

436
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,263
And Salma al-Majdi.

437
00:50:03,163 --> 00:50:06,063
<Strong competition.
- Pretty strong indeed.

438
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,863
<And is Mervat in the running as well?
- Yes, it's number five.

439
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,063
<i>If Mervat wins,
there will be no hope for us.

440
00:50:13,163 --> 00:50:14,630
You are right!

441
00:50:14,796 --> 00:50:19,496
If they reelect her,
it will be the same fight for another four years...

442
00:50:20,996 --> 00:50:24,430
Because she doesn't know anything
about soccer.

443
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:25,930
God help us.

444
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:11,996
<i>ask and you will find your way,
our home is near yours...</i>

445
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:17,930
<i>ask and you will find your way,
our home is near yours...</i>

446
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:23,963
<i>You are not led our way
We are led into your...</i>

447
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:29,130
<i>You are not led our way
We are led into your...</i>

448
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:34,796
"The strongest board of directors
of the Soccer Federation".

449
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,396
We have 24 minutes...

450
00:51:42,096 --> 00:51:44,330
- Are the girls here?
- Yes. They are all here.

451
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:47,630
Want to train or watch
the election results?

452
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:48,496
- Train!
- See the results!

453
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,663
Who wants to see the results,
raise your hand!

454
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,996
We hope that the concepts
change entirely.

455
00:52:06,763 --> 00:52:10,830
We will find out who will occupy
the female vacancy...

456
00:52:11,163 --> 00:52:14,230
Let's see the 8 candidates
for the women's vacancy...

457
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:18,296
- I think it must be Mervat...
- Mervat?!

458
00:52:20,896 --> 00:52:26,663
In the experiment, I support Hanan.
She has worked very hard.

459
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,263
What about your
inflexibility?

460
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,563
Hanan is inflexible?!

461
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:36,096
- No, Hannan doesn't stand a chance...
- Why?

462
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:38,196
.....

463
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:41,830
Good God!

464
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:56,863
I am happy for you and your team.
I hope everyone accepts.

465
00:52:56,963 --> 00:52:58,163
I hope so too.

466
00:52:58,263 --> 00:53:05,530
I'm rooting for Hilal's men's team,
but I promise to cheer you on at the games.

467
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:06,730
You are very kind. Thank you!

468
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:08,130
Hey, Coach!

469
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:14,330
When do you announce the results
of the women's wave?

470
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:15,796
Not yet?

471
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,030
They are in the vice-presidency...

472
00:53:17,596 --> 00:53:18,696
Are you still
in the vice presidency?

473
00:53:22,763 --> 00:53:25,296
Hinda wants some ginger tea,
please.

474
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,996
- Right away, Hinda.
- Thank you, girls!

475
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,996
33 votes for Kamal Shaddad,
against Motassem...

476
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:40,330
<i>34 for Kamal Hamed
Ibrahim Shaddad...</i>

477
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:46,696
<i>43 for Kamal Hamed
Ibrahim Shaddad...</i>

478
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:55,596
<i>44 for Kamal Hamed
Ibrahim Shaddad...</i>

479
00:54:08,796 --> 00:54:16,596
<i>Who's the boss? Kamal Shaddad!
Who is the boss? Kamal Shaddad!</i>

480
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:25,363
They are counting the votes. We're waiting for
the results of the women's wave...

481
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:31,996
<i>Now the result of the vote
for the women's seat in the Federation...</i>

482
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,696
<i>Nahed Bashir al-Baqir...</i>
16 votes.

483
00:54:41,896 --> 00:54:46,196
<i>Mervat Hussen al-Sadeq...
20 votes.</i>

484
00:54:46,563 --> 00:54:48,596
Mervat won...

485
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,696
- Wow!
- Wow?

486
00:54:53,163 --> 00:54:55,896
It stays in the same place.

487
00:54:56,196 --> 00:54:58,196
You will continue
doing nothing...

488
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,763
No change

489
00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:18,929
"The quiet soul"

490
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,396
Coach!
New Talents!

491
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:07,929
The tall girl is a tough one.

492
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:10,396
See how she kicks the ball?

493
00:58:13,129 --> 00:58:15,529
They remind me of the old days.

494
00:58:18,196 --> 00:58:21,263
Did you come on your own?
Come here!

495
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:24,396
The technician called them...

496
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:28,929
Hello, beautiful. What is your name?

497
00:58:29,929 --> 00:58:33,363
Saja and Fidaa and Yusra

498
00:58:33,463 --> 00:58:35,729
Want to see a picture
of our team?

499
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:41,196
Did you know that girls play soccer?
Or didn't you know?

500
00:58:41,329 --> 00:58:42,363
I didn't know.

501
00:58:43,363 --> 00:58:45,196
Fatouma, come here.

502
00:58:46,763 --> 00:58:50,229
Look at this picture,
this is Coach Hinda.

503
00:58:50,463 --> 00:58:53,163
Let's go,
take a closer look.

504
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:55,729
And this is me.

505
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:00,229
Want to see another picture?

506
00:59:24,696 --> 00:59:25,996
Straight ahead.

507
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:39,629
A lot of drunk people here,
have you noticed?

508
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,229
Are there no sheep here?

509
00:59:44,196 --> 00:59:45,696
In al-Hawa Street...

510
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:54,663
Why the bus
hasn't arrived yet...

511
00:59:57,629 --> 00:59:59,163
What are you going to do?

512
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:02,963
We will buy our things
on a trip.

513
01:00:03,863 --> 01:00:05,963
Can't we take
the sheep on our laps?

514
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:07,929
No, we can't.

515
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:26,263
The street is flooded.

516
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,663
Your friend is upset.

517
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:45,696
You brought us
the best you had.

518
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:53,496
Does it have sugar or not?
It doesn't...

519
01:00:53,996 --> 01:00:58,329
Bring some for coffee
and morning tea.

520
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,063
Should I drink this or not?

521
01:01:14,262 --> 01:01:17,096
A man flirted with me
in the store.

522
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:21,029
She is in a relationship.
I said

523
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,262
He fell in love with me
at first sight!

524
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:27,962
Dear Sir...
Can you imagine?

525
01:01:29,829 --> 01:01:31,096
I said "no problem".

526
01:01:31,096 --> 01:01:32,162
At first glance, Muhannad!

527
01:01:32,196 --> 01:01:33,596
He asked me
where I lived...

528
01:01:33,729 --> 01:01:34,829
I said Arkwit.

529
01:01:35,096 --> 01:01:36,029
He asked, "Where are you from?"

530
01:01:36,129 --> 01:01:37,296
"From here," I said.

531
01:01:37,729 --> 01:01:38,729
He said,
"No, you are not."

532
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:42,696
I said, "I am a Southerner
mixed with Arab blood."

533
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:45,229
He said:
"Wow... I love you!"

534
01:01:45,396 --> 01:01:48,396
He said,
"I'm going to visit him. Everything okay?"

535
01:01:48,462 --> 01:01:49,829
I said, "No problem."

536
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:53,162
He asked if I was married
and I said no.

537
01:01:53,296 --> 01:01:57,929
He said, "Well, I want you,
and asked me for the phone.

538
01:01:58,162 --> 01:01:59,962
I gave him a wrong number.

539
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:01,462
Was he serious?

540
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:05,196
Of course I was serious.
The people of Darfur are straightforward!

541
01:02:06,862 --> 01:02:08,996
People are already
are already celebrating...

542
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:52,229
Nancy, get rid of the bottles
of alcohol. The police are coming.

543
01:04:08,362 --> 01:04:10,296
I studied and worked
at the same time.

544
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:13,229
I would get home at 1:00 in the morning
and get up at 6 a.m.

545
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:17,229
I worked cleaning toilets
and other simple jobs.

546
01:04:17,262 --> 01:04:18,162
People talked...

547
01:04:18,329 --> 01:04:20,596
But I was motivated
and with a goal to achieve.

548
01:04:20,762 --> 01:04:25,796
If the Soccer Federation has sponsorship
for the men, it will have it for the women.

549
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:32,596
We have annual support from FIFA
since 1998.

550
01:04:32,829 --> 01:04:36,829
They treat us
like an umbrella.

551
01:04:37,262 --> 01:04:40,496
They ignore us and only turn to us
to us when they need us.

552
01:04:40,596 --> 01:04:43,362
For how long
will they continue to treat us like this?

553
01:04:43,562 --> 01:04:48,696
This is their right. If you don't demand it,
I can't do it all by myself.

554
01:04:48,929 --> 01:04:53,829
It must not be like our politicians,
who talk but never act...

555
01:04:53,896 --> 01:04:58,529
They only talk while our country
continues to go backwards.

556
01:04:58,596 --> 01:05:02,462
They say, "We will do this and that
and we will support women's soccer".

557
01:05:02,596 --> 01:05:04,896
And they have done nothing for us
since 1998.

558
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:08,162
The years have passed
and still no progress...

559
01:05:08,762 --> 01:05:14,396
Our goal is to show people,
in Sudan and then in the rest of the world,

560
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:16,762
that there are girls who play soccer.

561
01:05:16,796 --> 01:05:20,729
We have to pay out of our own pocket,
even if we have to beg.

562
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:26,362
I have a plan for women's soccer,
and you will see its impact.

563
01:05:27,996 --> 01:05:36,029
Our goal is to disseminate
the culture of women's soccer.

564
01:05:36,362 --> 01:05:41,329
But we have no sponsor
and the budget is pathetic.

565
01:05:42,196 --> 01:05:45,929
Can you support us
with the transportation?

566
01:05:48,096 --> 01:05:51,862
Give us the bus you have.
Are you still responsible for it?

567
01:05:53,062 --> 01:05:56,596
Thank you very much, Coach.
I know you do what you can...

568
01:06:04,662 --> 01:06:07,129
Who ordered the potatoes?

569
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:22,662
"Cultural and Athletic Challenge Club Support Fund
and Athletic Challenge".

570
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:35,662
Let me show you the research I did.

571
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:36,996
About what?

572
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:43,029
About women's sports
and that book I mentioned...

573
01:06:43,229 --> 01:06:46,095
Women's sports
is one of your interests?

574
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:47,129
Never!

575
01:06:47,262 --> 01:06:48,129
Impossible!

576
01:06:48,195 --> 01:06:49,729
Are you interested
in sports, in general?

577
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:50,129
No!

578
01:06:50,262 --> 01:06:52,229
Do you support women's soccer?

579
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:52,629
Never!

580
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:55,695
Is there a women's soccer team
team in Sudan?

581
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:56,129
No!

582
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:58,729
Do your family members support
your involvement in women's sports?

583
01:06:58,829 --> 01:06:59,195
No!

584
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:01,729
Are you familiar with the International
FIFA?

585
01:07:01,762 --> 01:07:02,662
God forbid!

586
01:07:02,662 --> 01:07:05,395
Do you think there is a relationship
between politics and sports?

587
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:10,262
Scratch that question!
We know nothing about politics!

588
01:07:10,429 --> 01:07:15,629
Do you think the biggest problem
that soccer faces is racism?

589
01:07:16,962 --> 01:07:19,595
Objection... Objection, Sara!

590
01:08:28,795 --> 01:08:35,595
This match is like a practice.
You know how to play.

591
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:40,129
The objective of this game is to show
people that we play soccer.

592
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:41,295
Are you okay?

593
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:44,695
Therefore,
there is no need to be afraid.

594
01:08:56,062 --> 01:08:57,395
Play nice, girl!

595
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:13,462
Kick it again! Great!

596
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:31,529
Do you know how to dominate
the ball this way?

597
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:09,529
<i>Oh smiling beauty
Your fragrance has captivated us</i>

598
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:14,229
<i>Our love for you is eternal</i>

599
01:11:23,995 --> 01:11:27,562
<i>We ask for peace...
And an end to injustice</i>

600
01:11:34,029 --> 01:11:37,695
<i>We ask for peace...
And an end to injustice</i>

601
01:11:41,695 --> 01:11:44,829
<i>Life is like this...
Life is like this...</i>

602
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:49,495
<i>But his days are numbered...</i>
