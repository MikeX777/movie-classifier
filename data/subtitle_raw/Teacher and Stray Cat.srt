1
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,040
If it gets on you, 
just let me know, okay?

2
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,460
Really? Daichi has 
started playing soccer?

3
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, but he's still a substitute.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,080
Oh, I see. He's a substitute then.

5
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,880
Yes, but he's really enjoying it.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,020
Being parents is not easy, right?

7
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,020
That's true.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,640
Oh, Tamago, you're off to work now.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,530
Be careful with the traffic, okay?

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,980
You've waited a long time.

11
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,380
I'm back, Chihiro.

12
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,220
Are you doing alright?

13
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,520
Good morning, Principal.

14
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,790
Good morning.

15
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,400
Amen.

16
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,690
Oh, Principal, welcome.

17
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,780
This taste is different from usual.

18
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,620
We switched to butter today.

19
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,300
So, the taste has changed a bit.

20
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,370
It's butter, huh?

21
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,640
Do you remember 
the taste of our family's bread?

22
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,010
Yes, but it's not the same.

23
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,520
Due to rising ingredient prices,

24
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,690
we had to switch to cheaper materials.

25
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,670
But, well...

26
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,950
The previous taste was still better, right?

27
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,880
A long time ago, I told my family that...

28
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,460
Finally, I've made up my mind now.

29
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,350
I think it's time to close down this shop.

30
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,860
Well, um...

31
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,920
I've thought about it a lot.

32
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,320
I'm tired of it now.

33
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,880
Do you still remember when you...

34
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,580
You've mentioned the phrase 
(shùnshuǐ tuīzhōu) to me before.

35
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,560
Yes, this phrase is not used 
to describe going against the current.

36
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,680
The correct usage is when you 
follow the direction of the river's flow.

37
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,860
You paddle with a bamboo pole 
to increase the momentum of the water.

38
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,640
That's right.

39
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,730
Just now, you demonstrated "shùnshuǐ tuīzhōu" for me.

40
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,500
By the way, Principal...

41
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,740
Could you take a photo with me?

42
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,830
As a final memory, 
I'd like to have a photo with you.

43
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,960
Oh, sure!

44
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,980
Impressive!

45
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,520
It's too close now.

46
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,890
Principal.

47
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,610
Today's weather is nice too, isn't it?

48
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,530
Hard to say.

49
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
How about playing a game?

50
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,240
Want to play a game?

51
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,250
Oh, I still have work to do.
Excuse me.

52
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,290
Look at how smug he is.

53
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,510
Still just like before, 
really annoying.

54
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,130
What job does he have anyway?

55
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,620
I'm back.

56
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,300
Oh, you!

57
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,420
you are enough

58
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,570
That shop is closing.

59
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,660
This is the last chance.

60
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,720
This is...

61
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,290
What is this?

62
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,780
In French, it's called "roboket."

63
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,140
"把dikatiri"...

64
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,060
What are all these things?

65
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
Give it to Katie.

66
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,220
as…

67
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,110
Hey, hello!

68
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,150
Has it started?

69
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,030
Good morning.

70
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,720
Has Sora arrived?

71
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,280
Pay attention to it.

72
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,000
If you like it so much, 
just keep it at your own home.

73
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,580
I'm considering it.

74
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,370
It's still in the process of dating.

75
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,550
I'm worried about these 
potted plants all the time.

76
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,260
What if she pees on the potted plants?

77
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,010
Cats only go to specific places.

78
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,160
By the way, I saw a cat pooping 
in the park not long ago.

79
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,600
Really? Did the cat run away?

80
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:59,940
No, it didn't. 
So I kept watching it.

81
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,860
I heard that if a cat keeps pooping 
while being observed by someone,

82
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,870
it means the cat doesn't fear that person.

83
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,620
Sora, come here.

84
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,440
Good boy.

85
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,640
Hey.

86
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,740
try pooping in front of me.

87
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,380
Shamisen: A traditional Japanese three-stringed musical instrument. There's a saying in Japan that shamisen used to be made with cat skin.
Look, I won't turn you into a shamisen.

88
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,420
(Imitating the sound of a shamisen) 
Ping, ping, ping, ping.

89
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,180
Inside a cardboard box, the bodies of four 
cats were found by the riverbank in Ogawa Town.

90
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,080
Here they come.

91
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,920
It's you.

92
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,700
I'm here again.

93
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,510
Hmm.

94
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,020
Didn't you have a lot of photographs?

95
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,230
You've never mentioned them to me.

96
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,020
Dealing with these hassles is 
all part of working for the government.

97
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,500
Oh, you're back to photography again?

98
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,110
By someone's request.

99
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,610
Can I get you some coffee?

100
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,990
Ah, that reminds me.

101
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,920
I wanted to ask 
you about this photograph.

102
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,210
When was it taken?

103
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,590
The school building's walls look strange.

104
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,520
It's from 1957 when 
a dog was launched into

105
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,340
space aboard a Soviet rocket.

106
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,860
The dog was sent into space.

107
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,420
Only one dog?

108
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,030
Nowadays, animal welfare organizations 
wouldn't stand by and do nothing.

109
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,080
But I think it's good.

110
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,600
Do you hate dogs?

111
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,040
No,

112
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,220
it's not that. 
I mean, your photographs

113
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,670
I quite like them.

114
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,720
It's a way to document 
the history of the streets and alleys.

115
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,890
I think you should get out more.

116
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,270
I'll go make some coffee.

117
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,900
Thank you.

118
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,760
Do you want anything in your coffee? 
Only milk is an option.

119
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,180
Anything is fine.

120
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,730
Or, it doesn't matter.

121
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,860
Seems like you're not getting what I mean.

122
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,110
What? This gesture?

123
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,910
You're being too exaggerated. 
I never said that.

124
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,680
Laika.

125
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,100
The first Earth creature to enter orbit 
on the Soviet satellite Sputnik 2. The dog, Laika.

126
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,280
What? 
Laika?

127
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,260
That's so cruel.

128
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,310
No one knows what 
happened to that dog.

129
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,610
Oh, you mean 
the Russian rocket incident.

130
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,110
What? 
It was about the dog?

131
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,660
It's so confusing.

132
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,700
That's right, 
that's it.

133
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,500
I brought this as a gift for Tamago.

134
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,060


135
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,880
Oh, I wonder if she'll like it.

136
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,840
It was even in the newspapers.

137
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,340
A cat was put into a box and 
thrown into the river, drowning to death.

138
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,460
And there were four cats?

139
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,380
Really?

140
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,820
Yes, it's true. At that moment, 
I thought of Tamago.

141
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,380
Here's this for you.

142
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,850
Ah, I never thought I'd have 
to wear this kind of thing.

143
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,800
Times have truly changed.

144
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,260
Indeed.

145
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,230
Put it on the cat; that way, 
I can feel more at ease.

146
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,900
Wouldn't it be great if it could 
live freely as a stray cat?

147
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,840
His name,

148
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,790
in Russian, is Otdovich.

149
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,670
Is that interesting?

150
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,590
It sounds difficult to understand. 
What's it about?

151
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,540
Well, this is a new translation 
I've been working on recently.

152
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,780
A new translation?

153
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,640
Yes.

154
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,020
It's about a man born into serfdom.

155
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,480
It's about a man born into serfdom.

156
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,720
Do you know what serfdom is?

157
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,900
I don't know.

158
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
Well,

159
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,440
serfs

160
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,300
were essentially 
the lowest social class, peasants.

161
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,660
So, it's about a man from 
the lowest rung of society.

162
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,160
A monk appears in his dreams,

163
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,580
a monk from Russia,

164
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,460
who says to him,

165
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,700
"One day, you will find enlightenment,

166
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,180
but before that, you will go through numerous
 desperate situations and near-death experiences."

167
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,360
His prophecy comes true,

168
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,460
as the man's life is filled 
with one cruel test after another.

169
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,940
In short, the story revolves 
around the experiences of this man.

170
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,940
On his journey, he meets a duke

171
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,080
who asks

172
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,410
Are you an artist?

173
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,990
To which the man replies,

174
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,910
"Beauty is the pinnacle of creation.

175
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,940
For beauty, one wouldn't 
hesitate to sacrifice oneself."

176
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,420
That's how he answered.

177
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,220
Ah.

178
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,470
Is the story interesting?

179
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,480
It's not a matter of whether 
it's interesting or not.

180
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,440
So, do you find your 
current work interesting?

181
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,400
I find it very intriguing.

182
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Intriguing, you say?

183
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,650
Yes, well, that's good then.

184
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,660
Shh, be quiet.

185
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Okay.

186
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,640
Tamako

187
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,230
watch out for cars!

188
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,540
One more time, one more time!

189
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,060
I'm back, Chihiro.

190
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,530
Sorry, I'm late.

191
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,000
It's wonderful, isn't it?

192
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,580
You have a home now, don't you?

193
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,310
Congratulations on your new home.

194
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,640
In today's English class,

195
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
we had a teacher 
from Australia

196
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,480
named David.

197
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,440
Good night.

198
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
See you tomorrow.

199
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,700
Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.

200
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,370
You're really busy, huh?

201
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,910
I called you several times during the day, 
but there was no answer.

202
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,080
Oh, it was the principal calling.

203
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,500
Is everything alright?

204
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,090
No,

205
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,050
it's just that the translation you asked me to do

206
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,260
isn't progressing smoothly.

207
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,810
What do you mean by that?

208
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,350
Exactly what it sounds like.

209
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,980
Hmm, I'll give you a mid-term report on it.

210
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,980
I'm amazed by you.

211
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,610
I never promised anything.

212
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,280
It's because you were bored 
and asked me to translate that book.

213
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,370
Even if you complete it, 
I'm not obligated to publish it, you know.

214
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,290
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

215
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,620
I just wanted to make sure you 
didn't forget about this task,

216
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,090
so I called you.

217
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,680
As long as you remember, 
that's enough for me.

218
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,550
Alright,

219
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,560
don't focus too much on it either.

220
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,280
I'm afraid of having good intentions 
but causing trouble, Principal.

221
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,940
You always have an 
interesting way of speaking.

222
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,780
Alright, I understand.

223
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,280
By the way,

224
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,400
I've noticed something interesting

225
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,680
about Russian literature.

226
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,500
It's not categorized based on 
the time before or after the revolution,

227
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,660
but rather, it's divided by the 
19th and 20th centuries.

228
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,050
but rather, it's divided by the 
19th and 20th centuries.

229
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,130
I've come to understand this recently.

230
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,380
Oh no, the watch stopped.

231
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,440
Good morning.

232
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,280
Let's take another picture.

233
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,460
I'm going to take it.

234
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,670
Oh, it worked! Impressive!

235
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,710
5 cm.

236
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,460
Wow, amazing!

237
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,860
Principal,

238
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,400
one more time, 
just once more.

239
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,770
He smiled; 
what a silly guy.

240
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,190
I'm back.

241
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,240
Oh,

242
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,950
where did you come in from?

243
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,270
What's up?

244
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,750
Do you have any objections to me?

245
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,140
Enough is enough.

246
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,790
Don't come any closer.

247
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,000
You annoying brat!

248
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,370
So that's it, it's "Nicheu-ōnie."

249
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,520
Just mutter something, mutter, mutter.

250
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,370
"Dī-kā-tī-rīkā."

251
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,390
Is that French?

252
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,840
Ouch!

253
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,310
Want me to do it?

254
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,320
I'm feeling motivated.

255
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:51,630
Sora probably won't come anymore.

256
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,750
Why?

257
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,300
Someone found a cat's body 
by the river in Kogawa Town.

258
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,560
It was on the news.

259
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,710
Ah, here she comes.

260
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,210
Sora

261
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,660
Sora's roaming range is at most 
only five hundred meters.

262
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,770
It's unlikely for she to go all the 
way to Kogawa Town.

263
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,820
Why are you getting angry at me?

264
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,710
What's wrong, Sora?

265
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,830
The collar...

266
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,670
Oh, hello.

267
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,830
Long time no see,

268
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,010
Principal.

269
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,830
I'm sorry.

270
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,600
When I was fortunate enough to get into college,
I received your congratulatory note.

271
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,770
However, I was planning to return to school,

272
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,520
but things didn't go as smoothly as I hoped,

273
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,630
so

274
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,320
I haven't decided what to do next.

275
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,680
No, it's just that...

276
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,630
that

277
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,290
What about

278
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,830
Cat?

279
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,210
Are you talking about Sora?

280
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,640
Sora

281
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,490
is a stray cat living around here.

282
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,300
She hasn't changed a bit

283
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,290
and is still as arrogant as ever.

284
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,850
Is she dead?

285
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,200
She's alive, not dead.

286
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,710
It's okay; I'll take her to the hospital.

287
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,510
Shall we head to school?

288
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,540
Is that a small knife?

289
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,830
The blade is thin, 
like a paper cutter.

290
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,210
Is she dead?

291
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,160
Although the wound is not deep,

292
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,380
there was a lot of bleeding.

293
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,110
She took medicine and is now resting.

294
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,070
Do you want to go see her?

295
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:32,830
No need.

296
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,830
Shogo, wake Grandma up.

297
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,850
Okay.

298
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,080
Grandma went to eat over there.

299
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:38,850
Here.

300
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,510
Unfortunately, we couldn't film

301
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,980
the Great Jade Jizo.

302
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,250
Please understand it through my face, 
voice, and other elements

303
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,930
Well, let me take a look at the real thing first.

304
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,980
Wow, it's awe-inspiring!

305
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,690
How can I put it? 
It's impressive.

306
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,580
Ah, it can't stand up anymore.

307
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,040
The photos are already developed.

308
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,400
Is the boss here?

309
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,660
Store Closure Notice
Thank you for your long-time patronage, 
dear customers.
Thank you.
Freshly Baked Bakery 
Lily.

310
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,710
Go a bit over there.

311
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,870
Stay a little further.

312
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,690
Look this way.

313
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,570
Hello there.

314
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,280
Yes.

315
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,510
I understand. 
I'll be right there.

316
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,860
Grandma.

317
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:38,790
Inside.

318
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,050
I'm sorry.

319
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,500
Cat.

320
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,440
I'm allergic to cats.

321
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,700
Grandma, someone 
has come to take you back.

322
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,190
Get up, Pamp.

323
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:18,900
Can you stand up?

324
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,950
watch your step.

325
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,830
Grandma, please don't 
wander around.

326
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,790
Don't cause trouble for your caregivers.

327
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,450
I'm still at work.

328
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,080
Shuichi.

329
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,170
I'm Shogo.

330
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,130
Shuichi is my father.

331
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,860
I'm Grandma's grandson.

332
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,580
You even forgot your grandson's face.

333
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,260
Blaming her will only 
make her more confused.

334
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,350
Then what should I do?

335
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,770
My dad won't be back until the evening.

336
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,570
I have a job too.

337
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,010
What's it to me?

338
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,410
Grandma, let me walk you.

339
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,370
She's gone.

340
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,000
Over there, 
on the other side.

341
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,900
Please do not feed stray cats.
Some people feed stray cats, but this is a selfish and irresponsible behavior.
Please don't contribute to the increasing number of cats.

342
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,990
Wait a moment.

343
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,570
What are you doing?

344
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:58,900
Cats.

345
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,280
Cats.

346
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,660
Cats.

347
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,360
I'm a bit hungry too.

348
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,600
I'm hungry too

349
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,570
Yesterday's store promotion, 
I bought a lot of stuff.

350
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,470
If you can, 
please try some.

351
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,410
Hmm.

352
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,790
It's really delicious.

353
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,450
What's wrong?

354
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,970
The butter is different.

355
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,960
Um,

356
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,460
there's something I want to ask you.

357
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,970
There's something I just can't understand.

358
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,790
Teacher, the note you gave me,

359
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,230
I can't comprehend it no matter what.

360
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,560
It's this one.

361
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,590
I looked it up in the dictionary and asked others, 
but I still couldn't figure it out.

362
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,240
It means "please do your best"
or "keep up the good work."

363
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,570
Have I done something?

364
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,890
I've been thinking that 
way for a long time.

365
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,930
You can always say 
"1, 2" and such things, right?

366
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,910
You're here.

367
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,350
Why?

368
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,190
Did you want to become a teacher?

369
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,060
Do you want to be a teacher too?

370
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,860
Not really.

371
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,670
I see.

372
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,700
As for me...

373
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,370
that is

374
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,320
I just go with the flow.

375
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,090
So

376
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,840
what did you want to be when you were a child?

377
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,880
Akato Suzunosuke.

378
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,440
That's a character from an anime, right?

379
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,610
No, it's from a TV drama.

380
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,320
How about you?

381
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,980
i can't remember.

382
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,120
I've been thinking about it since earlier.

383
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,580
Is there anything good 
about being a teacher?

384
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:15,700
None.

385
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,660
Quick answer, huh?

386
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,290
After becoming the principal,

387
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:23,100
There's nothing.

388
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,040
Being a principal 
seems quite challenging, huh?

389
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:35,830
When I was young, 
I was happy.

390
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:38,190
No matter what child it was,

391
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,990
As long as I personally taught them, 
there would be a change.

392
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,190
Humans are truly the most interesting.

393
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,300
Because that's still an obedient age,

394
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,460
And I am enthusiastic about it.

395
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,800
Even with personal guidance, 
there are times when it's not possible.

396
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:15,350
Good morning.

397
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,320
Ah Tamago..

398
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,510
You're up early today.

399
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,220
Tamago.

400
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,890
Oh, Tamako, not going to take a nap?

401
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,360
And then the other person...

402
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,980
And then the other person, yes, yes.

403
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,190
Hurry up and disappear.

404
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,980
Quickly now.

405
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,110
That is...

406
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,200
No, be quick about it.

407
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,590
I won't open the door for you.

408
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,770
I've locked the kitchen window too.

409
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,390
Give up quickly, give up.

410
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,770
Go away.

411
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:01,260
Let me say this straight.
Every time you come here,

412
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,300
I'm reminded of my deceased wife.

413
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,590
Every day, 
every day,

414
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,980
I'm fed up with it.

415
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,290
Don't come again.

416
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,920
I told you,

417
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,360
You're so annoying.

418
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,710
Listen to me.

419
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,430
It's not just our family.

420
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,990
You run around everywhere,

421
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,300
causing trouble,
And making misguided advances.

422
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,650
Do you think doing that will 
make everyone pay attention to you?

423
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:24,270
I just can't stand your personality.

424
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,680
If it were only at my house, 
that would be fine.

425
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,350
No, don't come to my house anymore.

426
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,210
Go to other places to please others.

427
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,620
I don't want to deal with you.

428
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,900
It's been a while.

429
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,360
It looks like it might rain.

430
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,720
The pronunciation of "tenkuu" (sky) is the same as "tenkuu" (rare encounter).
Look at the sky.

431
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,770
Mimi is here.

432
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,300
Come, come, come.

433
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,340
I've been waiting 
for you for a long time.

434
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,150
What's wrong?

435
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,160
Nothing, it's fine.

436
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:15,900
It always comes around this time.

437
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:19,730
Because it also knows.

438
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:23,110
It knows the time.

439
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:05,630
Name: Sora A tricolor female cat Wearing a red collar around the neck The collar has a golden bell Not a domesticated cat, but often visits our store It hasn't appeared for about a week, and we are a bit worried

440
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,230
Welcome.

441
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:40,860
Principal.

442
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,010
Principal.

443
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:50,430
Your wife used to take care 
of our business regularly.

444
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,470
Long time no see,

445
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,330
Principal.

446
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,180
The flyers outside...

447
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,050
Ah, they're not ours, you know.

448
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:13,440
It's just that we can't 
help but be concerned, right?

449
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,360
Is there something you need?

450
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:21,770
When did you last see it?

451
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:31,600
Didn't you say it's been a week?

452
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,860
Really?

453
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,940
Maybe someone adopted her.

454
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,450
That would be good. 
We just want to confirm, right?

455
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,040
yes.

456
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:43,850
Principal,

457
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,970
is the cat here?

458
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:40,050
No.

459
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,320
is the cat here?

460
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,350
No.

461
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:51,470
That's suspicious.

462
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:30,960
What are its traits?

463
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,020
Traits?

464
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,740
It's quite aloof

465
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,160
and independent.

466
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,140
If you call its name, 
it might respond to you.

467
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:45,110
Some people call it "Tamako," 
and others call it "Sora."

468
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,430
It's friendly with people around here, 
but not with me.

469
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,990
May I ask, what breed is your cat?

470
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,240
Breed? It's just an aloof breed.

471
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:02,440
Specific characteristics? 
It's a tricolor cat.

472
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,760
A tricolor cat.

473
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,690
Yes, an ordinary tricolor cat.

474
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,840
Where are the spots located?

475
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,900
Spots? Um,

476
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,660
they are similar to a crescent moon here.

477
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,760
Alright.

478
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,640
The colors are relatively light.

479
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,250
The area around the eyes is brown.

480
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:29,700
brown, right?

481
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,880
Yes, that's right.

482
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,940
Alright, I got it.

483
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,510
Principal...

484
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,740
Let's see. 
How about taking a look?

485
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,650
That's incredible, isn't it?

486
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:45,680
Annoying. 
Was it you who broke it, Mie.

487
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,220
Dad really likes this curtain, you know.

488
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,020
How can you not cherish it?

489
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,840
Ah, wait.

490
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:42,090
Thank you so much.

491
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,360
Goodbye.

492
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:49,480
Oh, Principal.

493
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,800
Do you want to see a cat?

494
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:54,930
What?

495
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,650
Do you want to see a cat?

496
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,490
what did you say?

497
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:00,650
Do you want to see a cat?

498
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:01,700
Ah, a cat?

499
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,270
But I heard

500
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,590
that when cats die, 
they hide themselves.

501
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,240
You idiot!

502
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:26,190
Are you alright?

503
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:37,170
By the way, teacher, 
have you been to the health station?

504
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:37,920
Health station?

505
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,570
People from the Environmental Health Department said 
that many cats were taken to the health station.

506
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,180
Then I'll go to the health station.

507
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,120
You can't get there by riding a bicycle.

508
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,490
It's far. Take the bus, it's five stops away.

509
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,920
Five stops?

510
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,540
Yes.

511
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,030
Five stops won't work either. 
There's a bus stop over there.

512
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,450
Really?

513
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,850
No.

514
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,520
Fujimi-cho San-Chome Station.

515
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,480
Please take your belongings 
and prepare to get off.

516
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,560
I need to get off.

517
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:24,150
Yesterday, the principal 
came to look for the cat.

518
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,040
Really? 
When?

519
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,310
Ah, it was just after noon.

520
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,240
That's interesting.

521
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,850
Why?

522
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,340
Why is it interesting?

523
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,910
Maybe he came to look for 
the cat after seeing the flyers

524
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,550
the ladies at the hair salon made.

525
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,180
Flyers?

526
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,920
We're looking for a cat, 
so we need to use photos.

527
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:40,860
Use photos?

528
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,610
Yes.

529
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:45,250
Then, let's put the photos like this, here.

530
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:46,390
- Write "Missing Cat 
- Looking for this cat" on them.

531
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,470
Hello there.

532
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:50,570
Oh, Mayumi!

533
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,820
Long time no see, what's up?

534
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:58,670
Sora.

535
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,080
she said sora.

536
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,780
Do you know it?

537
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:08,500
I started feeding it a month ago.

538
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:14,320
I was worried it might get hit by a car,

539
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,660
but it didn't show up at the hospital.

540
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:25,460
Principal, 
I've been looking for it everywhere,

541
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,570
even went to the health station.

542
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,200
So, we also want to 
do whatever we can to help.

543
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:37,400
Indeed.

544
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:42,420
Many people may not like this child much,

545
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,930
but leaving it like this is just too pitiful.

546
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,960
Right.

547
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,670
I want to join too.

548
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:52,920
Let me participate.

549
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,170
After it went missing,

550
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,460
I realized that the time I spent feeding

551
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:06,120
it was essential to me.

552
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:12,020
So, please let me help you find it.

553
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,840
Alright, thank you. Sit here.

554
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,640
Thank you.

555
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,220
- Pass me the glue. 
- Alright.

556
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,110
Glue, huh?

557
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,490
Looking for this cat.

558
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:18,360
Hello.

559
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:20,520
Hello.

560
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,410
Hey, wait!

561
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,880
Ah, can I put this up here?

562
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,100
I'll be troubled if you do that.

563
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,290
How much was it, 70 yen? 70?

564
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:40,270
Then, how about here?

565
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,420
No.

566
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:43,650
100 yen?

567
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:45,780
105 yen?

568
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,460
Then, how about here?

569
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,880
No.

570
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,000
So, where do you want me to put it then?

571
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:00,210
You want me to put it here, 
but you have this attitude?

572
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,640
I'm not doing charity here.

573
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:05,870
Why do you insist on putting 
up these missing cat posters?

574
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:13,150
I thought you also cared about that cat.

575
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:15,860
I'm sorry.

576
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,260
Never mind.

577
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:25,200
Just leave it there. 
I'll think about where to put it later.

578
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,150
Goodbye.

579
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,730
Mie, Sora, Tamago.

580
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,810
what are you doing?

581
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:26,620
i am looking for a cat.

582
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:29,400
A cat?

583
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:32,840
Is it your pet?

584
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:33,630
No,

585
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:35,170
it's a stray cat.

586
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:38,500
Hey.

587
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:43,770
Can I take a look at that?

588
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,240
Let me tell you a place 
where you can put it up.

589
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:11,620
Sorry to bother you.

590
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,290
Kagawa Fujikawa.

591
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,470
Where is this cat from?

592
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:21,350
Ah, it's from Fujimi Town.

593
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,880
Cats are very cautious creatures.

594
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:30,820
I don't think it would cross 
the river to come here.

595
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,450
There are also 
people who don't like cats.

596
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,940
They put the cat in 
a car and throw it far away.

597
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:52,680
But this cat is fearless of humans.

598
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:08,780
I'll lend you this.

599
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:15,220
A cage?

600
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,760
Put cat food and 
its favorite things inside.

601
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,920
Maybe it'll come in.

602
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,190
If you want to take care of the cat, 
this is necessary.

603
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,250
Alright.

604
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,210
People who feed 
stray cats are like this.

605
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:43,040
They love and play with 
the cat but don't take responsibility.

606
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,680
They never think about the cat itself.

607
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,010
Because of these people, 
the number of stray cats keeps increasing.

608
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:50,010
Eventually, they end up in shelters.

609
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,150
Are you criticizing me?

610
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:58,780
of course.

611
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,570
I'm sorry for putting you in a place like this.

612
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:33,450
Anything is possible. 
Stay here for now.

613
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:34,970
I'm leaving.

614
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,720
Thank you.

615
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,640
Let's put it up here.

616
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,400
Missing Cat Notice.

617
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:49,410
Grandma.

618
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,780
Grandma.

619
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:02,560
Is it tasty?

620
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,280
Have some.

621
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,300
Awesome, really awesome.

622
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,280
- How is it? 
-Impressive.

623
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:37,490
Mie

624
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:40,740
Tamago.

625
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:42,860
Sora

626
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:45,750
Mie

627
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,350
Come here.

628
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,790
Tamago

629
01:14:55,830 --> 01:14:56,620
Mie

630
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:43,320
Mie

631
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:49,800
Mie

632
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,060
Mie..

633
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,600
Are you okay?

634
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:01,670
Ah...

635
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:03,980
Did you drop something?

636
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,710
i'm looking for a cat.

637
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:10,060
A cat?

638
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,980
Am I that funny?

639
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:57,290
Anyway, would you like some? 
Your meal.

640
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,060
i'm not a cat.

641
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:40,840
Cat allergies, 
they can't be cured, right?

642
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:42,980
What's wrong?

643
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,970
I'd like to ask you to 
help me find a good cat.

644
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:54,880
Because when my grandma 
was here with that cat,

645
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:57,650
she was always very happy.

646
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,630
Mie, Mie, Mie.

647
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,640


648
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:44,720
Mie

649
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:49,950
Mie

650
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:52,060
what are you doing?

651
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,760
Come down from there.

652
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,940
Come down.

653
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,700
Come down.

654
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:09,820
Can you hear me? 
Come down from there.

655
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,470
If it's not a domestic cat, 
can't you search for it?

656
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,970
The problem is, you can't wander 
around busy streets late at night.

657
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:39,940
Maybe it's had an accident. 
We have to find it.

658
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,330
But it's just a stray cat.

659
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:44,410
that kid saved my life.

660
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,870
Cats are nocturnal, 
we can only search at night

661
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:56,760
Around here, 
there might be a gathering of cats.

662
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,330
A gathering of cats?

663
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,930
I mean, what are you doing?

664
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,310
Uh, you know, this and that...

665
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,820
I've run out of options.

666
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:15,790
Sorry.

667
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,960
This time was supposed to be 
for taking care of Dad and Grandma.

668
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:22,400
Let's go.

669
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,790
Alright, let's go.

670
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,610
It's really funny.

671
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:37,360
You...

672
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,860
I was asking the young girl.

673
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:45,620
Can you tell me where 
the gathering of cats is?

674
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:49,500
Alright.

675
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,260
The principal just sits there, 
looking dumbfounded.

676
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,500
So funny!

677
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,840
Hey, isn't this funny?

678
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,860
It's you!

679
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:08,440
I heard about this and 
was wondering if it was you.

680
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:09,800
What?

681
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,050
Do you two know each other?

682
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,420
He scolded me once.

683
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,280
You, the principal?

684
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,980
Lately, I keep getting scolded.

685
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:26,140
Never mind, get in the car.

686
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,760
Thank you for your trouble.

687
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,900
The girl earlier said 
that the cat saved her life.

688
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,300
I...

689
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:56,280
I've been bullied at school all the time,

690
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,320
and the teachers won't help me.

691
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
I can't tell my parents either.

692
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,860
I thought it would be better to just die.

693
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:33,400
So, I ran onto the main road.

694
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:41,840
At that moment,

695
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,760
I heard a cat meowing.

696
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:56,240
chihiro

697
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:02,640
Always

698
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,340
It stayed by my side,

699
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:17,190
That's why

700
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,880
this time,

701
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:28,630
I want to save Chihiro.

702
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,540
Tamago, it's time to eat.

703
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:38,040
Sora...

704
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,740
Doesn't seem to be here.

705
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:45,860
Or here.

706
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,290
Help me with the light.

707
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,180
Let's go to the next place.

708
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:58,900
Alright.

709
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:01,380
Tamago...

710
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,120
Sora...

711
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:14,500
Hey!

712
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,400
Is this where the cats are gathering?

713
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:23,480
I thought the cats were having 
some kind of meeting together.

714
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,710
Let's split up and search.

715
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,080
I'll drive and check other gathering spots.

716
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:35,280
Don't get taken away by 
the police again, okay?

717
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,050
Yeah, that's how it is.

718
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,450
Exactly.

719
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:43,700
Tamago...

720
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,570
Chihiro...

721
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,870
Mie.

722
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,050
Tamago...

723
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:54,050
Chihiro...

724
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:59,120
Mie.

725
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:10,630
Chihiro Chihiro.

726
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,820
Sora..

727
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,250
Chihiro.

728
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:16,950
Mie.

729
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,840
Mimi, Sora, Tamago.

730
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,520
Chihiro.

731
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,340
Tamago.

732
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,380
Mie,

733
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:33,320
Tamago.

734
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:43,870
Mie.

735
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:05,610
Chihiro.

736
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:08,330
Tamago.

737
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,000
Mie.

738
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,060
Tamago, Tamago.

739
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,120
Chihiro.

740
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,240
Tamago..

741
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,990
Chihiro.

742
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:12,220
Sora..

743
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,800
Chihiro.

744
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:20,260
Tamago.

745
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,840
Chihiro.

746
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,660
Mie.

747
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,930
Wait, wait.

748
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:36,080
Mie.

749
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,120
Mie.

750
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,320
Mie.

751
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:56,020
Mie.

752
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:56,790
Mie.

753
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,670
Mie

754
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,920
Mie.

755
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,640
Mie.

756
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:34,170
Tamago, Sora.

757
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:36,410
Come and have your meal.

758
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,020
Sora.

759
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,720
Sora.

760
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,780
It's mealtime, come on.

761
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,250
It's mealtime, come on.

762
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,800
small sky

763
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:56,800
small sky

764
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,760
Give the principal some barley tea.

765
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,260
Sure.

766
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:30,940
All I need to do is pamper it more.

767
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,120
I'm really frustrated with myself.

768
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:41,650
Every time the cat comes to my house,

769
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:44,230
it reminds me of my deceased wife.

770
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,340
That's why I drive it away

771
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,440
and tell it not to come back.

772
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:06,350
When it comes to say goodbye to my home,

773
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:08,720
I should let it bid farewell properly.

774
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,620
Until it's satisfied.

775
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,200
I don't want to think about it,

776
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:20,080
But I don't want to forget either.

777
01:31:28,570 --> 01:31:30,640
Principal

778
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,930
You've changed.

779
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:50,000
You must have fallen for a kitty.

780
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,170
Want another drink?

781
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:01,360
Yes, please. Thanks.

782
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,990
Even if we find it, 
we can't chase after it.

783
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,910
Then what should we do?

784
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:18,240
We can only wait.

785
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:20,710
Approach it slowly,

786
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,040
Give it cat food,

787
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:23,780
Keep calling it,

788
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,850
And keep waiting like this.

789
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:33,260
Even if we find it,

790
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,760
It might not be a good idea.

791
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:38,620
After going missing,

792
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:40,720
If it had a bad experience,

793
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,060
Its personality might change.

794
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,800
We need to be patient.

795
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,160
The principal, 
I'm sure we can do it.

796
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,460
I'm starting to eat.

797
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,960
What's wrong?

798
01:33:18,380 --> 01:33:19,740
ah

799
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,260
I CAN DO IT.

800
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:42,150


801
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:53,840
Is this a dad joke or something?

802
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,220
Hey, what are you talking about?

803
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,460
Nothing.

804
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,270
Stop right there! 
I'll call the police if you run again!

805
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:08,940
It's late at night,

806
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:11,070
I can't just ignore it.

807
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:22,190
Ah, Principal, do you know this kid?

808
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:27,580
I only know he's not a cat.

809
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:32,130
Seriously...

810
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:36,120
When did you start coming here?

811
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,490
Let's stop here for today.

812
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:49,040
I have to take this kid back.

813
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:55,960
Alright, see you tomorrow.

814
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:00,020
Yeah,

815
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:02,280
See you tomorrow

816
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:04,790
Got it.

817
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,240
See you tomorrow.

818
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,820
Goodbye.

819
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:20,680
Come out quickly.
Where's your backpack?

820
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:24,500
Don't drag your backpack.

821
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,210
Principal.

822
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:27,740
Pack your backpack properly.

823
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:29,500
Principal!

824
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:31,830
Pack your backpack properly.

825
01:35:32,730 --> 01:35:34,520
Principal!

826
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,820
Principal!

827
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:42,440
Ah, it's you.

828
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,440
- Spare me, please. 
- Yeah, right.

829
01:35:44,440 --> 01:35:46,670
Don't be so dismissive.

830
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:49,430
I stopped looking for 
the cat and went to look for you midway.

831
01:35:49,430 --> 01:35:51,200
How many times have I called you?

832
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,290
Seriously...

833
01:35:52,290 --> 01:35:54,840
I'm sorry. Anyway...

834
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:59,220
I thought I'd leave it at 
that today after telling everyone.

835
01:35:59,410 --> 01:36:01,320
So stubborn.

836
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,200
Who is everyone?

837
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,080
Ah, that...

838
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,350
Hello, good evening.

839
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:12,060
Good evening.

840
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:15,350
So, is everyone 
also looking for the cat?

841
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:16,120
Yes

842
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:18,230
Me too.

843
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:20,900
Is that so? Thanks.

844
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,660
You're welcome.

845
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:25,890
Where have you been looking today?

846
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:29,340
I went to Fuji Ichome 
and around the port area.

847
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,630
Is that so?

848
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:35,180
I heard the cats are having 
a gathering around the port.

849
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,400
So I went there.

850
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,120
I thought a cat gathering 
would be like a meeting,

851
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,490
but they were just sitting there.

852
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:43,020
Any other news?

853
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,870
Is Tamago not there?

854
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:46,190
No, it's not there.

855
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:49,000
i am allergic to cats.

856
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I see.

857
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:53,280
Did you put up flyers around the port?

858
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,310
Yes, I did.

859
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:55,310
That's great.

860
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,860
- Are you hungry? Want one? 
- Thank you.

861
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:00,980
There are also rice balls.

862
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,780
It's a shame I couldn't search with everyone.

863
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:06,510
What about tomorrow? 
Will you continue tomorrow?

864
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:07,440
of course.

865
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,460
Then I'll join you.

866
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:16,680
Why are you looking for the cat?

867
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:19,450
Because it's important.

868
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:21,580
it's just a stray cat.

869
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:23,420
But that's also important.

870
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:25,240
is it still alive?

871
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:30,440
I don't know, 
maybe it's already gone

872
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,440
Maybe it's already dead.

873
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:40,900
No matter what living creature it is, 
they will all eventually die.

874
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,020
So, the remaining companions

875
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:54,020
will work hard to mediate their relationships.

876
01:37:57,890 --> 01:37:59,750
I can go back alone.

877
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,750
Let's go together.

878
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,120
Today,

879
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,300
i don't want to be alone.

880
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:32,850
Principal, thank you so much.

881
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,540
I'm really sorry.

882
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:12,380


883
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,040
Honey.

884
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,710
Honey.

885
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,400
The cat is here!

886
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,040
Hurry, come over here.

887
01:41:46,820 --> 01:41:50,300
I don't know whose cat it is; 
it might be a stray.

888
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:56,030
Even so, you really aren't afraid of people, huh?

889
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:00,920
Have you been getting food 
from various places?

890
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:03,700
You're so lucky.

891
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:10,360
Does it look like the deceased mie?

892
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,510
Spare me, please.

893
01:42:12,690 --> 01:42:15,040
I've had enough of cats.

894
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,200
Alright, alright.

895
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,120
If you dislike cats,

896
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:27,220
you won't understand one of life's great joys.

897
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:30,900
Come over every day from now on.

898
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:34,700
Stop it; let's leave cat alone.

899
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,000
Why?

900
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,520
They'll die anyway.

901
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,140
Of course, they will.

902
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:42,300
Aren't we going to die too?

903
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:45,040
But we will live longer than them.

904
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,850
Let it live its life on its own.

905
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,550
Don't be like this.

906
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:52,460
Don't be like this;
you might grow fond of it.

907
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,460
Isn't that nice too?

908
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:56,460
Darling.
