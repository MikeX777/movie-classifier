1
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,598
Felipe!

2
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,938
- Felipe!
- Yes?

3
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,816
Bring up some number two wick.

4
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,570
- We're going for water.
- When you get back.

5
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,867
All right.

6
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,431
Mr. Denton.

7
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,434
You indicate west
for the wind this morning.

8
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:57,109
It's always west here. Never changes.

9
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,111
To a seaman, Mr. Denton,

10
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,692
there's a big difference
between west and west-southwest.

11
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,651
I'm not a seaman, captain.

12
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,120
Obviously.

13
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,620
And this is no ship, either...
Captain Moriz.

14
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,165
Will?

15
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,122
Will?

16
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,836
Number one or number two?

17
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,093
- Number two, and hurry up!
- All right.

18
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,976
Was that sail or steam last night?

19
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,731
It was too dark to see.

20
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,992
Steam ships always carry
a white light amidships,

21
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,785
a green to starboard and a red to port.

22
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,834
I think I've told you that before.

23
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,372
Yes, you have.

24
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,799
Sometimes I don't think
my heart's in my work.

25
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,797
Then you shouldn't be in this work.

26
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,917
Is she still lit, captain?

27
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,454
That light is much too yellow.

28
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,794
It's the whale oil.

29
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,962
You can't see whale oil two miles.

30
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,714
I see it everywhere.

31
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,217
Can smell it, too.

32
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,681
I've had ships, Mr. Denton...

33
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,933
Captain... this is not a ship.

34
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,025
This isn't just another job, Mr. Denton.

35
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,943
And that's not just
another light up there.

36
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:15,906
Nope, it's an argand burner
multi-wick, oil-fed dioptic system

37
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,663
with a beam...
- That's enough, Mr. Denton.

38
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,581
I begged them to give me a crew of seamen.

39
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,883
Captain, I'm sorry
I'm not a seaman, but...

40
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:02,953
Seeing that light on a black night
is as close to looking at god

41
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,333
as most men ever get.

42
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,354
And the devil himself
won't put it out while I'm alive.

43
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,940
But does it take a seaman
to keep it lit, captain?

44
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,864
No.

45
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,448
It's a job for old men and...

46
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,995
Felipes.

47
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,038
Why are you here, Mr. Denton?

48
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,186
Why?

49
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,796
Will!

50
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,780
- Good morning, Felipe.
- Morning, captain.

51
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,113
Good morning, Mario.

52
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,617
Did you have a lot of trouble
with Felipe last night? Huh?

53
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,540
Who put that light out? You? Or Felipe?

54
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,623
I think I saw a deer
this morning, captain.

55
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,964
There are no deer on this island, Felipe.

56
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,847
- Could've swum over.
- I think I saw one, captain.

57
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,511
- Captain, can we try for it?
- All right.

58
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,568
I hope you weren't dreaming
you saw a deer.

59
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,485
Here's the key to the gun cabinet.

60
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,487
Thank you.

61
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,654
Good luck.

62
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,600
- Shh.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

63
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,470
I did see one.

64
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,673
Are you married?

65
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,337
No.

66
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,218
I ran a gold mine.

67
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,401
Will...

68
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,144
The wind, it shifted.

69
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,316
It's south.

70
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,065
Southeast.

71
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,525
Nah.

72
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,951
Never changes.

73
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,495
Always west.

74
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,382
Mario!

75
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,768
Mario, Mario.

76
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:57,985
Mario.

77
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,867
Will!

78
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,146
Felipe.

79
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,113
You hit him!

80
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,884
Look, there's blood. Can't be far.

81
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,853
Was I right, Will? Did I see a deer?

82
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,309
That's a strange looking deer,

83
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,894
but let's get it to a frying pan.

84
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,874
We'd better hurry.

85
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,916
Not without this fresh meat.

86
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,266
Mr. Denton, get up here!

87
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,908
Mr. Denton, drop that.
Get up here at once.

88
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,750
- Felipe.
- Yes?

89
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,247
- Gun.
- Oh.

90
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,124
And I'll tell the captain you're coming.

91
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,001
She's coming in.

92
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,101
She's flying a distress flag.
Sickness, maybe.

93
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,324
That fresh meat's for us.

94
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,873
A distress flag, I said, Mr. Denton.

95
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,416
We'll share what we have.

96
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,456
Thank you.

97
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,208
Come along, Felipe.

98
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,335
And leave your animal behind.

99
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,007
They'll think we're savages.

100
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,591
Hm?

101
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,590
Now you be a good boy, huh?

102
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,552
Whoa.

103
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,510
Whoa!

104
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:53,952
Denton!

105
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,997
William Denton.

106
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:02,545
This... is your captain. Hear me.

107
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,419
This light will burn no more.

108
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,798
You stand accused

109
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,005
of the cold-blooded murder...

110
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,727
Of lightkeeper... Andrew Moriz...

111
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,397
And assistant lightkeeper, Felipe Mendoza.

112
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,353
For these murders... you will die.

113
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,605
Unless...

114
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,449
You surrender.

115
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:37,196
Put your trust in your captain.

116
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,835
Am your only hope.

117
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,832
Hey. Hmm?

118
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,659
Come on, eh?

119
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,672
Mario.

120
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,251
Mario. Mario.

121
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,136
Hmm?

122
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,253
What's this?

123
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,314
Hey.

124
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,814
Yeah, this'll do.

125
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:51,119
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

126
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,253
Hm.

127
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,346
Ooh! Aww.

128
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,264
Ehh.

129
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,823
Damn good, too. Here, try some.

130
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,181
You're hungry.

131
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,392
Hey!

132
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,553
Mario. Mario!

133
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:32,903
Come here.

134
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,239
Mario.

135
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,564
Come back here.

136
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,899
Mario!

137
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,929
Mario.

138
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,355
Whoo!

139
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,107
Ehh. Ehh, ehh.

140
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,036
Ow! Ow!

141
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,857
Allow me to introduce myself.

142
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,947
I am Jonathan Kongre...

143
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,369
Your captain.

144
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:22,677
Mr. Tarcante. My very excellent mate.

145
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:26,507
Mr. Virgilio,
a bulwark of my establishment.

146
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,026
Why did you murder them?

147
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,119
Do I detect an American accent?

148
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,450
How very agreeable.

149
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,410
I used to have dealings
with your countrymen

150
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:58,121
during the happy days of the slave trade.

151
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,083
Most profitable.

152
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:06,004
Most revealing... about human nature.

153
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,844
But while I am amusing myself,
reminiscing, you are starving.

154
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,530
Seems a pity to waste
Balduino's culinary talents...

155
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,409
On a man who's about to die.

156
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,442
Is this your companion?

157
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,112
Little chattering man.

158
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,247
What a sense of humor god must have.

159
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,214
Emilio.

160
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,967
Mario.

161
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,053
Mario, Mario.

162
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,802
And now, Mr. Denton...

163
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:21,560
Perhaps you feel refreshed.

164
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,313
And ready for a little exercise.

165
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,603
Who are you?

166
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,980
Who are you?

167
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:31,858
Who are you?

168
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,427
Yeah!

169
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,721
Denton.

170
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,482
Arriba!

171
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,919
Mario!

172
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,784
Whoa.

173
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,608
Release him!

174
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:13,550
Huh? Jeez, look at that. That's gold!

175
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,852
That's gold, girl. Gold!

176
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,864
Gold!

177
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:07,934
Goddamn cheat!

178
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,489
Hey now, come on, Matt.

179
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,072
Now, have a drink. Come on, please.

180
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,092
Look out!

181
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,470
Rocks ahead! The port bow!

182
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,528
Vamos.

183
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:24,372
I am delighted to have this opportunity of
making your acquaintance, miss, uh...

184
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,076
You are English, I take it.

185
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:33,169
My name is Arabella Ponsonby.

186
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,503
I am traveling from San Francisco to
England on the California Flyer.

187
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,715
I am a respectable woman.

188
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:50,899
My father was the honorable
Charles Ponsonby of Puddletown, Dorsetshire.

189
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,447
A lady.

190
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,410
May I offer you my arm, miss Ponsonby?

191
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,586
She's salvage, captain.

192
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,800
We must use our salvage properly,
Tarcante.

193
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:25,430
It would be a pity to damage it
before the time comes for the sharing out.

194
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,188
Look how its white skin burns in the sun.

195
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,050
What's all this?

196
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:27,968
Wreckers.

197
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,898
My name is Giuseppe Montefiore.

198
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:52,285
- You the cook?
- No, the ship's engineer.

199
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,454
Just what I need.

200
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,911
Now...

201
01:01:58,006 --> 01:02:00,873
- We better get out of here.
- Who are you?

202
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,300
- Assistant lightkeeper.
- What happened?

203
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,923
I'm out of a job.

204
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,429
My clothes...

205
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,094
I have no clothes.

206
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,442
Mrs. Fanshawe, my aunt...

207
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,529
Where is my aunt?

208
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:51,867
It's wonderful how perfectly the female
mind understands the priorities.

209
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,199
Her clothes, first.

210
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,327
Her aunt, poor lady, only second.

211
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:05,004
Was she a fat lady, your aunt?

212
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,169
Fat?

213
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:10,252
Old. My chaperone.

214
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,427
- She was...
- Fat.

215
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,850
I believe I have
seen something of your aunt.

216
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,854
There you are, my dear.

217
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,534
Open it.

218
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,619
A keepsake.

219
01:04:57,102 --> 01:05:00,344
You have survived only because my
associates found you as pretty

220
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,929
as the rings on your poor aunt's fingers.

221
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,402
You're no Christian.

222
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,646
Oh, your dress... My apologies.
Virgilio!

223
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,782
What is your color?

224
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:23,954
Cerise?

225
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,081
Apricot?

226
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,458
Virginal white.

227
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:33,927
Oh, how delightful it is
to talk of such delicate matters.

228
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,253
Captain.

229
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,555
The men wish to look at her.

230
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,600
Well, never mind.

231
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,013
We'll gossip over dinner.

232
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,437
Don't worry, they won't touch you.

233
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,814
Don't leave me, please.

234
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,573
You may proceed, Tarcante.

235
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:00,998
Sir, help me!

236
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,622
I shall dress for dinner.

237
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:29,350
- They call you seamen, huh?
- That's why we have ships.

238
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,554
Everybody but me.

239
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,553
Can't we do anything?

240
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,101
Nothing.

241
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,559
Just stay alive.

242
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,316
Come on, let's try to find some food.

243
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,520
Ah.

244
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,941
Ah.

245
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,187
They can't stay here forever.

246
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:24,194
We just wait
for that relief ship to get here.

247
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,339
Never really got to know him
till it was too late.

248
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,008
You never give up.

249
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,977
If captain Moriz could see
what was happening to his lighthouse.

250
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,315
He wouldn't like it.

251
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,164
Huh?

252
01:12:19,293 --> 01:12:22,160
Ahh, Giuseppe, I take it all back.

253
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,296
It's a big one.

254
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,698
That little monkey would cuddle up
around Felipe's ear,

255
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,117
and he'd go bouncing along,

256
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:58,571
twanging away on that damn Jew's harp.

257
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:03,705
Yeah. I miss him.

258
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,544
The way they were killed.

259
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:17,298
You know, I was lucky. I...

260
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,307
Ah, Denton.

261
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,934
Y un amigo.

262
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:52,709
Our fish!

263
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:42,971
You drink like a man, Arabella.

264
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,855
I'm used to living among men.

265
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:50,732
Oh, yes.

266
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,936
Very few women in California.

267
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:59,526
In California,
they chase after gold, not women.

268
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,007
But certainly...

269
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,756
A woman of your beauty...

270
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:27,679
Almost as beautiful as she was.

271
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:36,111
But then girls always look their prettiest
on their wedding day.

272
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:39,117
Look.

273
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,701
"To William, our best man.

274
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,245
Affectionately, Matthew and Emily Jane."

275
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:47,792
Who is...

276
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,581
How would you like...

277
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,589
To enter a charade with me...

278
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:57,677
Emily Jane?

279
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,800
Why did you call me Emily Jane?

280
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,632
Does a name mean so much?

281
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:09,812
William...

282
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:11,896
loves you.

283
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,643
Loves me?

284
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,904
Desperately, Emily Jane.

285
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,904
For 12 long years, he has loved you.

286
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:32,910
He has kept every letter
you ever sent him.

287
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,541
Tied in blue ribbons.

288
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,675
Blue ribbons.

289
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:48,350
And now you have come back...

290
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,769
as young and beautiful as ever.

291
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,774
A miracle.

292
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,032
They say every woman is an actress.

293
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,497
For a woman of your background...

294
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,292
it is a role...

295
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,716
worthy of your talents,...

296
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,678
Miss Emily Jane.

297
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:38,977
I'll do it.

298
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,485
Was she on the ship?

299
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:26,576
I think so.

300
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:35,536
Strange.

301
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,296
Emily Jane?

302
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,716
Miss Emily Jane?

303
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,796
Emily Jane!

304
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,891
The captain would like to see you.

305
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,613
Will! Will!

306
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:08,365
Will!

307
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,739
Are you crazy?

308
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,000
- Was she alone?
- I don't know.

309
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:19,793
We had a lot of English families.

310
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:22,917
English.

311
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,709
Emily Jane!

312
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:37,098
Pleasant walk, Emily Jane?

313
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,315
Why do you want him so much?

314
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,355
Isn't it obvious?

315
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,280
He knows.

316
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:54,662
He's the only man left who knows.

317
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,740
But I know.

318
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:11,842
Every ship that passes
must pay a tribute to this rock.

319
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,678
A tribute to me...

320
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,184
as yours did.

321
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,644
Why is your ship leaving?

322
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,268
Target practice.

323
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:34,151
Wouldn't want me
to blow up my own schooner.

324
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,823
I reserve that for
Mr. Denton's relief ship...

325
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,166
When it arrives.

326
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:59,824
Her name was... Emily Jane.

327
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,290
I loved her, but...

328
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,163
she married somebody else.

329
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:15,298
Matt Edwards. He was a gambler.

330
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,005
Cheat.

331
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:24,011
He used to come around on paydays
and clean out my crew.

332
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,024
Then one night he pulled a gun and...

333
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,394
Well, I had to shoot and...

334
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,491
I killed him and...

335
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,990
Of course, she never talked to me.

336
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:43,197
Never had anything
to do with me after that, but...

337
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,330
She was the only woman I ever loved.

338
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:54,837
I still love her.

339
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,804
Will.

340
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,649
Look.

341
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:17,523
We cannot let that false light
wreck another ship.

342
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,750
- And still we do nothing?
- That's right.

343
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,836
- Just try to stay alive.
- They'll wreck her.

344
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,466
We just stay alive.

345
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,154
Distress rockets.

346
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,160
Will.

347
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,297
Will!

348
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:55,838
Will!

349
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:42,186
Emily Jane.

350
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,066
Will.

351
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,023
Will Denton.

352
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:39,069
You're not her.

353
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,078
Will.

354
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,080
It's not her.

355
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,455
Why?

356
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,256
Why?

357
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:54,460
He made me.

358
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:03,382
Mr. Denton, help me. Help me, please.

359
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:12,583
Whoo!

360
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,094
Whoo, whoo!

361
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:29,648
Denton is alive, Mr. Tarcante.

362
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:32,324
I want him back.

363
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:42,314
Are you sure?

364
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:45,227
Yep, I'm sure.

365
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,020
Why?

366
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:54,949
Because I have to.

367
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,155
Maybe.

368
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:06,829
But the same crazy man who saved my life.

369
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:15,514
Ahh.

370
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,254
Ah.

371
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:46,214
What are you doing here?

372
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:50,927
Well, when a lady cries out for help...

373
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,187
I am not a lady.

374
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:56,940
I'm a maid.

375
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:03,022
I'm not Emily Jane,
I'm not Arabella Ponsonby.

376
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:06,075
She was killed
with all the others on the ship.

377
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:09,950
I just took her name because I thought
that way I could stay alive.

378
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,906
But I was her maid.

379
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:13,912
I'm a nobody.

380
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:16,035
A nobody.

381
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:20,543
I'll help a nobody, then.

382
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:33,307
How dare you
come into a lady's room like this.

383
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:56,252
Come on.

384
01:43:03,511 --> 01:43:04,511
Hurry!

385
01:43:06,472 --> 01:43:07,472
I can't.

386
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:14,097
I can't. I...

387
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:17,680
Where do I go?
To a cave to be hunted like you?

388
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:22,481
Here, at least I've got clothes,
food, a bed.

389
01:43:23,489 --> 01:43:26,231
What can you give me? Nothing.

390
01:43:28,285 --> 01:43:31,277
You asked for help. We risked our lives.

391
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:44,423
Will, please understand.

392
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:51,714
I understand.

393
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,788
Denton!

394
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:11,097
Denton!

395
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:40,046
Denton!

396
01:51:15,210 --> 01:51:17,622
On this 15th of November,

397
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:22,082
in the year of our Lord, 1865.

398
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:25,133
I, Jonathan Kongre,...

399
01:51:27,181 --> 01:51:31,265
by the authority vested in me
as sovereign of this latitude,...

400
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:34,218
and as your captain...

401
01:51:35,522 --> 01:51:39,481
do accuse you, William Denton,

402
01:51:39,568 --> 01:51:43,857
and the person of one,
Giuseppe Montefiore, peasant...

403
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:46,692
of the callous...

404
01:51:47,701 --> 01:51:49,362
and premeditated murder...

405
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:52,910
of six citizens...

406
01:51:54,333 --> 01:51:55,493
of this realm.

407
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,325
Come out, Will!

408
01:51:59,504 --> 01:52:01,870
Claim your peasant!

409
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:06,883
I hardly think
there is any doubt of your guilt.

410
01:52:08,055 --> 01:52:10,216
You're not man enough to get Denton.

411
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:16,309
Little chattering man.

412
01:53:06,905 --> 01:53:07,905
Sir...

413
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:15,360
You slept well, I trust, miss Ponsonby?

414
01:53:17,499 --> 01:53:19,990
By all the pleasure I can bring to you.

415
01:53:21,003 --> 01:53:23,335
Have brought me, miss Ponsonby.

416
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:38,936
Please!

417
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:41,852
He has been sentenced.

418
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:47,021
I did what you told me!

419
01:53:49,031 --> 01:53:51,272
I want Denton!

420
01:54:25,692 --> 01:54:30,311
- I want him alive.
- Alto, alto, alto!

421
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:32,987
Call the men on board,
the woman is theirs.

422
01:54:33,075 --> 01:54:35,987
Everybody on board, the woman is yours!

423
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:42,994
At last, a queen of tragedy.

424
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:45,872
You made me an actress.
I'm not Arabella Ponsonby at all!

425
01:54:45,962 --> 01:54:48,294
I lied to you, I lied, I lied!

426
01:54:48,507 --> 01:54:52,716
No! Kongre!

427
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:54,043
Kongre!

428
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:26,837
That will eliminate temptation.

429
02:00:49,242 --> 02:00:50,607
Remember, Kongre...

430
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:53,321
I can save you.

431
02:01:03,006 --> 02:01:05,998
They'll believe my story
when the relief ship gets here.

432
02:01:06,509 --> 02:01:07,589
So...

433
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,801
you will be the lightkeeper.

434
02:01:12,891 --> 02:01:13,891
And I?

435
02:01:16,519 --> 02:01:19,056
You can be a passenger
on that wrecked steam ship.

436
02:01:35,497 --> 02:01:37,704
You evil son of a bitch.

437
02:01:45,924 --> 02:01:47,960
I can smell you from here.
