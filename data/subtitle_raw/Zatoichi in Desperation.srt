00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:31,768
Blind man.

15
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:37,929
There are holes here and there.
Be careful.

16
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,722
Thank you.

17
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:47,445
I like the sound of the samisen.

18
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:50,531
Where are you going?

19
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:54,288
I have no destination.

20
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,803
I travel like the wayward wind.

21
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,082
And you?

22
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:06,612
I'm going to Choshi to see my daughter.

23
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:14,083
I heard Choshi is a busy town.

24
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:20,172
Many geisha houses in the red light area.

25
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,770
Do you by chance know one
called the Ogiya?

26
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:33,011
What's a blind man got to do
with geisha houses?

27
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,246
Goodbye.

28
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,007
Wait.

29
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:51,729
It's just my compliment. Don't be offended.

30
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,086
You give me money?

31
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:04,643
Thank you very much. I'm happy to accept it.

32
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,566
What's happened?

33
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:13,364
Why did he do it?

ZATOICHI IN DESPERATION

35
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:41,170
Would you tell me where to find the Ogiya?

36
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,203
I'll take you.

37
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,049
You know the Ogiya?

38
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:57,808
Yes.

39
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:58,085
Welcome! We've been talking about you.

40
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:01,848
Please come in.

41
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:03,848
Okimi!

42
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:13,290
Bring Namiji immediately. Get moving!

43
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,649
Is this the Ogiya?

44
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:44,722
Yes.

45
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:50,769
I came to see a girl that works here.

46
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:53,289
Her mother plays the
samisen.

47
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,404
A samisen player?

48
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:56,609
Name?

49
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:02,727
Welcome sir. Come on in.

50
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,524
Have a great time!

51
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:07,923
Age?

52
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,243
I don't know.

53
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,368
Hometown?

54
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:12,844
Hometown?

55
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,889
I don't know that either.

56
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,881
You don't know anything.

57
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:22,448
Are you trying to kid me?

58
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:24,404
I'm busy. Don't bother me.

59
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:30,885
What's this?

60
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:34,882
Thank you!

61
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:37,449
Her mother's name?

62
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:40,049
Look at this.

63
00:09:43,973 --> 00:09:45,042
It says Nobu.

64
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,809
That's her mother's name.

65
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:49,882
Nice name.

66
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:53,284
Come in. I'll look for her.

67
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:59,410
Is the girl a geisha?

68
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:02,328
Maybe.

69
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:03,084
Aren't you sure?

70
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,888
Terrible, isn't it.

71
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:13,762
There are seventeen geishas
and thirteen maids here.

72
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:19,690
Am I supposed to ask them,

73
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:27,971
"What's your mother's name?"

74
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:33,882
Nobody'll come here.

75
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:37,202
You can say you're waiting for a customer.

76
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:44,926
Bedding.

77
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:52,532
It smells the same in every inn.

78
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:56,091
Ten men a night!

79
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:58,369
Don't try too hard.

80
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:01,889
It won't do any good.

81
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:09,843
Is her daughter a prostitute?

82
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:17,164
Was she going to buy back her daughter?

83
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,288
How'd you get here?

84
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,205
Over the fence.

85
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,366
I missed you.

86
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:43,206
I've a customer.

87
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:47,090
They'll look for me. I'll call for help.

88
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,928
I'm dying! Dying!

89
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,532
Nishikigi!

90
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,731
Nishikigi!

91
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,643
What's this?

92
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,123
I got it gambling.

93
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:04,602
Come to me openly next time.

94
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,562
What a show!

95
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:48,328
I want to feel like I'm dying too.

96
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,206
Nishikigi is her name.

97
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,168
We're back.

98
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,332
Thank you.

99
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:34,892
Come in.

100
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:38,287
Where was she?

101
00:14:38,373 --> 00:14:41,683
In a cheap inn in Yokachiba.

102
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:45,281
I'm glad you brought her back.

103
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:47,848
Have some fun here tonight.

104
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,287
Some troublemaker you are!

105
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,450
You can't run away from here.

106
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,850
Didn't you know?

107
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:10,443
Don't scold her here.

108
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,652
Be careful.

109
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,291
Bring some water.

110
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,486
Wash them.

111
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:29,883
My term is over. Why can't I go home?

112
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:35,121
Don't you know? You're still in debt.

113
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,682
That's a lie.

114
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:38,769
Lie?

115
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,806
You mean I'm a liar?

116
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,365
Lock her up.

117
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:02,682
No! Don't torture me!

118
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:06,329
Forgive me!

119
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:12,328
Sister!

120
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:22,203
Don't come here.

121
00:16:23,093 --> 00:16:24,651
When will you be back?

122
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:26,966
Tomorrow.

123
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:27,889
Honestly?

124
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,692
Take this and go home.

125
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:41,813
Coming.

126
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:58,651
I'm glad to have a girl.

127
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:02,052
Try to be nice.

128
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:10,647
You amaze me.

129
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,766
You have an eye for girls.

130
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:15,809
Nishikigi is beautiful.

131
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,163
Zatoichi!

132
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:29,292
A blind man who wants a geisha?

133
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:35,009
Boss lioka would give you 100 ryo for his head.

134
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:38,246
Big money!

135
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,963
Thank you.

136
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:51,045
You sound young. How old are you?

137
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:54,287
Fourteen.

138
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:57,404
Your mother?

139
00:17:58,013 --> 00:18:01,050
She's dead.

140
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:05,928
Any relatives?

141
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:07,924
I've a brother.

142
00:18:08,173 --> 00:18:10,926
Don't peek in my room.

143
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:13,322
Behave yourselves.

144
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:23,770
You loved me at first sight?

145
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,131
Where?

146
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:43,408
Not exactly. I like your voice.
"Love at first voice."

147
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:47,323
Can it be true?

148
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:55,447
About your mother, did she play a samisen?

149
00:18:57,373 --> 00:19:00,251
I heard her play it when I was a child.

150
00:19:00,893 --> 00:19:07,651
Will you have a look at this?

151
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:17,488
Look.

152
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:25,006
It says Nobu.

153
00:19:26,453 --> 00:19:30,685
My mother's name. You know her?

154
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:34,046
Not exactly, but...

155
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:36,171
Give me a cup of tea.

156
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:46,888
I met her on the way... near Sakura...

157
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:54,042
She fell into the river.

158
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:58,450
Into the river? My mother?

159
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,406
Were you, at all, responsible for her death?

160
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:39,202
How much should I pay
if I want to redeem you?

161
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:44,404
Why do you ask?

162
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,569
Your geishas are coming.

163
00:20:56,773 --> 00:21:00,891
You can bite them or lick them.

164
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,805
They're all yours.

165
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,089
We lick them?

166
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:11,885
No thanks.

167
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:17,932
You can be sure they won't give us nice girls.
We'd be better off getting Zatoichi.

168
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:21,206
20 ryo each for his head.

169
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:24,611
He's a blind man.

170
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:29,845
We'll go to lioka anyway. Take his head.

171
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:33,324
And we'll get 100 ryo.

172
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,729
That's my idea of good business.

173
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:46,088
You know I'm Zatoichi, don't you?

174
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:53,846
Don't you talk to blind people?

175
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:31,048
This wasn't my intention.

176
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,732
What was your intention then?

177
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,091
Not my net.

178
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:42,402
Take my wife instead. Take her as payment.

179
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,969
Odd or Even.

180
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:55,165
How old is she?

181
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:57,883
Over forty, but...

182
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,886
Beautiful?

183
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:05,613
What good is your homely wife?

184
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:09,763
Bring money, and you'll have it back.

185
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:15,686
Go home.

186
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:42,489
Will you let me play as banker?

187
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:48,642
You're blind. Can you handle dice?

188
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:55,525
I'm blind, but I have two hands
to handle them.

189
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:04,205
Alright. Let's have a go.

190
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,250
Dice box.

191
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:15,487
Don't use your private dice.

192
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:21,969
The 'man' character for one?

193
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:27,123
Peculiar dice.

194
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:37,968
Forgive my lack of skill, please.

195
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:40,772
That's fine.

196
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:52,685
Place your bets.

197
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,722
Three ryo?

198
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:08,127
One is enough.

199
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:16,925
Evens. Evens.

200
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:09,611
Three ryo on even.

201
00:28:11,053 --> 00:28:13,613
Why don't you bet on odd?

202
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:15,923
Alright.

203
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:16,923
Even.

204
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,051
Look. All of you.

205
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,647
I have more.

206
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:16,290
Bet all the money you have.
That's gambling.

207
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:52,045
Everyone bets on odd?
No one on even?

208
00:29:52,653 --> 00:29:53,972
No bets on even.

209
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:07,125
Oh, they rolled out of my sleeve.

210
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:19,730
Odd or even?

211
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:26,612
No answer.
Then it must be even.

212
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:35,326
'Man' and 'man'. Even.

213
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,449
I won.

214
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:41,572
Thank you.

215
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:44,770
Wait. Strange.

216
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:47,170
Where are your dice?

217
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:52,249
I have them in my sleeve.

218
00:30:53,813 --> 00:31:00,491
You cheat! You hustled us!
You dirty blind ass!

219
00:31:01,053 --> 00:31:03,123
You know where you are?

220
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:08,765
I thought I was in a gambling party
with dishonest men.

221
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:18,171
Did you bet on the dice outside
the dice box?

222
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:24,967
That's a funny way to dice.

223
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:33,848
You're supposed to bet on the dice in the dice box.

224
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,607
You must be asking for trouble.

225
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:37,688
I'll teach you.

226
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,570
Beat him up!

227
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:47,126
Give my money back!

228
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,132
Get off him.

229
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:06,762
You're Zatoichi! Aren't you?

230
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,888
Did you have fun?

231
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:33,482
Who are you?

232
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:37,492
I'm Mangoro, the boss.

233
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,007
You could pay your respects.

234
00:32:57,253 --> 00:33:00,882
My compliments.

235
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:12,606
Buy yourself a drink.

236
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:38,322
Get back to the game.

237
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:47,493
What brought him here?

238
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:52,762
Boss lioka wants us to stop him
if he shows up.

239
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:56,210
Don't worry.

240
00:33:56,413 --> 00:33:58,722
It's a good thing he's blind.

241
00:34:00,293 --> 00:34:01,487
Leave it to me.

242
00:34:26,853 --> 00:34:30,732
So his price is 100 ryo.

243
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,965
Are you tired?

244
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,843
They say blind men are passionate in bed.

245
00:34:45,013 --> 00:34:46,890
Passionate or not,

246
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,530
I don't even know if
he can make love, so far.

247
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:53,685
You mean he didn't touch you?

248
00:34:56,253 --> 00:35:00,326
Twenty... Thirty...

249
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:04,443
This will be enough for her ransom.

250
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,609
The mistress is waiting for you.

251
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:22,447
I'll be right there.

252
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:31,770
Thank you for coming.

253
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:38,769
Nishikigi told me you want to redeem her.

254
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:41,128
Is that honestly true?

255
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,531
That's right.

256
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:48,882
That's very nice. But she's our best geisha.

257
00:35:49,173 --> 00:35:50,526
How much?

258
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,891
Fifty ryo!

259
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:16,731
Give me the bond.

260
00:36:17,813 --> 00:36:19,087
Of course. Right away.

261
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,922
What are you doing?

262
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:26,882
I told you to give him a cushion.

263
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:39,809
This is the bond for her service.

264
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:48,209
Check it.

265
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:22,522
Let's go somewhere far away.

266
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:32,693
No. They'll catch me and beat me.

267
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:36,169
You too, Shinkichi.

268
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:40,611
They won't. We'll go down into the sea.

269
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:44,882
The sea?

270
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:50,689
We'd drown.

271
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:54,487
I don't mind dying if we're together.

272
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:23,608
When my term is over, we'll live together.

273
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:31,565
It's only three years.

274
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:39,885
Some day we'll live together.

275
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:49,687
Then we'll build a grave
for Father and Mother.

276
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,291
What's that?

277
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:40,612
Does it make you feel sexy?

278
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:51,885
I'll teach you how.

279
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:11,685
You dirty little moron.

280
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:43,882
Hurry!

281
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:48,802
Old man.

282
00:40:57,213 --> 00:41:00,046
What do you think you're doing?

283
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:02,853
Did you use this boat?
It's mortgaged, remember?

284
00:41:02,933 --> 00:41:07,290
If you want to use it, clear your debt first.

285
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:11,931
He doesn't. Teach him a lesson.

286
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:25,890
You forced my son to gamble
and swindled him.

287
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:30,248
What can a fisherman do without a boat?

288
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:55,163
It's been a long time.
I've been dying to see vou.

289
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:03,249
You're as charming as ever.

290
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:06,606
No joking. But I believe you.

291
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:12,723
Kaedé. Greet him.

292
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,131
She's nice.

293
00:42:35,893 --> 00:42:41,047
I feel great. I like a good fire.

294
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:45,008
You came at the right time.

295
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,649
You can't burn our boats...

296
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:17,805
...just because we don't work for you.

297
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:21,687
How can we live without boats?

298
00:43:23,413 --> 00:43:26,371
Don't say that. Let's go.

299
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:34,852
If you have any complaints, speak up.

300
00:43:35,533 --> 00:43:37,603
My sword is listening.

301
00:43:39,413 --> 00:43:41,369
We'll make it even. Pick them up.

302
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:46,370
Come on, pick up the weapons.

303
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,812
Draw them!

304
00:44:22,253 --> 00:44:23,732
You did it!?

305
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:25,892
What's this?

306
00:44:26,813 --> 00:44:30,567
Brat! Come here!

307
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:48,805
Devil!

308
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:55,890
You want a fight?

309
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:03,092
Kill them all!

310
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:57,447
You wrote you need 500 ryo...

311
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,333
...so I brought it immediately.

312
00:47:00,223 --> 00:47:03,101
That's really good of you.

313
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:04,857
I'll borrow your 500 ryo.

314
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:09,215
He's backing you. Remember that.

315
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:16,612
I'm looking forward to your success.

316
00:47:17,623 --> 00:47:19,853
Leave it to me.

317
00:47:19,983 --> 00:47:24,898
This money helps me establish
my new business.

318
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:28,501
You're planning to catch tuna fish, whales...

319
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:31,655
...and whatever else you can.

320
00:47:31,783 --> 00:47:35,219
You've monopolised fishing around here.

321
00:47:35,943 --> 00:47:39,015
You're a shrewd businessman.

322
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:43,616
The fishermen's small boats and nets
are useless.

323
00:47:44,023 --> 00:47:46,742
It's all over for them.

324
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:57,577
They'll have to work for me for low wages.

325
00:47:57,863 --> 00:48:04,052
I'll be able to make eighty ryo a day.

326
00:48:11,223 --> 00:48:12,417
Bring the girl.

327
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:15,940
Hurry up!

328
00:48:22,223 --> 00:48:23,736
Greet him.

329
00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:29,811
Pour him a drink.

330
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,703
What'll you use my money for?

331
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:43,942
I'll bribe Mr. Hosomi, the magistrate.

332
00:48:50,503 --> 00:48:53,939
What're you doing? You drink it.

333
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:06,898
So you're smart enough to
rope the magistrate in.

334
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:10,738
She's too young. I'll drink it for her.

335
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:12,742
Fool!

336
00:49:12,823 --> 00:49:14,461
Take her away!

337
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:19,054
Don't interfere!

338
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:22,619
She's nice.

339
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:25,538
She's a rare cherry.

340
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:30,058
It's true.

341
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:47,938
What is it?

342
00:49:48,023 --> 00:49:49,138
A firefly.

343
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,379
In front of you.

344
00:49:57,423 --> 00:50:00,142
It's glowing!

345
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,538
You smell nice.

346
00:50:04,223 --> 00:50:07,932
You only smell? Can't you see?

347
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:11,773
I'm sorry.

348
00:50:13,823 --> 00:50:19,136
I know you're beautiful.
I know, even if I'm blind.

349
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:23,739
Ever had a wife?

350
00:50:28,423 --> 00:50:30,539
She ran away?

351
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:38,736
Love me.

352
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:57,662
It's no good if you don't have eyes.

353
00:50:57,783 --> 00:50:58,932
Goodnight.

354
00:51:09,143 --> 00:51:10,371
Sleepy?

355
00:51:17,463 --> 00:51:18,691
Asleep?

356
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:32,856
Asleep or awake? Who knows?

357
00:52:38,983 --> 00:52:40,257
Ushi!

358
00:52:47,983 --> 00:52:51,578
Why did you let him redeem you?

359
00:52:58,143 --> 00:53:01,215
But you couldn't raise the fifty ryo.

360
00:53:02,223 --> 00:53:04,657
My money was included.

361
00:53:04,903 --> 00:53:06,382
He cheated.

362
00:53:07,223 --> 00:53:11,341
He's a notorious gambler called Zatoichi.

363
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:19,698
Boss lioka is offering 100 ryo for his head.

364
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:25,096
Goddamn it.

365
00:53:29,463 --> 00:53:35,254
The thought of you in bed with him
breaks my heart.

366
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:38,734
Damn it! Can't I do something?

367
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:42,179
Stupid! I never slept with him.

368
00:53:43,343 --> 00:53:45,811
Try me.

369
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,379
True?

370
00:54:29,303 --> 00:54:34,980
You're all mine.
Nobody else can have you.

371
00:55:02,423 --> 00:55:04,061
Welcome home.

372
00:55:11,623 --> 00:55:13,215
I bought a fish.

373
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,537
Oh really?

374
00:55:18,343 --> 00:55:19,219
What's that?

375
00:55:21,023 --> 00:55:22,820
The fish.

376
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:29,132
A male fish.

377
00:55:30,183 --> 00:55:32,777
Let's eat him.

378
00:55:33,023 --> 00:55:35,935
Yes! Why don't we?

379
00:55:48,743 --> 00:55:52,372
I'd lose face if I didn't help you.

380
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:58,453
Zatoichi is blind.

381
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:02,413
We can kill him by ourselves.

382
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:08,338
But we didn't want to disturb
your town on our own.

383
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,896
We must kill him no matter what.

384
00:56:15,183 --> 00:56:17,697
We'll avenge our pal.

385
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:23,259
The four of us join together...

386
00:56:23,663 --> 00:56:26,177
...we won't fail to kill him.

387
00:56:34,743 --> 00:56:37,701
Well, I'll go with you.

388
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:46,663
Thank you.

389
00:56:48,263 --> 00:56:52,142
I'll see how he kills you.

390
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:06,257
If they can't kill him, I've got nothing to lose.

391
00:57:06,943 --> 00:57:10,697
I'll get his head anyway.

392
00:57:12,623 --> 00:57:14,932
Why did you redeem me?

393
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,942
You don't even touch me.

394
00:57:20,463 --> 00:57:26,459
I want you to live like an ordinary woman.

395
00:57:27,663 --> 00:57:28,698
"Ordinary?"

396
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,091
How?

397
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:37,015
Without a man?
Without a way of earning money?

398
00:57:37,823 --> 00:57:42,499
You can have a man.

399
00:57:47,943 --> 00:57:49,296
Which one?

400
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:56,181
The one who can see?
Or the one who can't?

401
00:57:58,503 --> 00:58:04,851
And then?

402
00:58:06,303 --> 00:58:09,340
And then?

403
00:58:10,183 --> 00:58:13,459
The child will grow up, have a child...

404
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:15,341
And then?

405
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:19,695
The child will grow up...

406
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:23,703
No kidding.

407
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:28,497
I'm asking why you redeemed me.

408
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:36,532
Because you killed my mother?

409
00:58:43,623 --> 00:58:45,818
It's for your sake.

410
00:58:46,383 --> 00:58:49,181
Not for mine or other people's.

411
00:58:49,823 --> 00:58:52,383
It's your conscience.

412
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,137
I don't like it.

413
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:02,416
Take me back to the geisha house.

414
00:59:04,463 --> 00:59:08,376
You raised the money by gambling.

415
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:00,727
Blind man.

416
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:07,404
You want to see the colour of...

417
01:00:09,613 --> 01:00:11,285
...your blood?

418
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:14,485
Don't joke.

419
01:00:14,853 --> 01:00:22,089
I couldn't see my blood whether it
was red or black.

420
01:01:00,213 --> 01:01:06,402
I have no grudge against you.

421
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,688
Do I have to fight?

422
01:01:09,813 --> 01:01:15,012
We'll be damned if we don't avenge our pal.

423
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:18,806
It was his own fault.

424
01:01:18,893 --> 01:01:19,962
Shut up!

425
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:24,763
If we don't kill you, we'll lose face.

426
01:01:26,253 --> 01:01:30,087
Lose face and live long.

427
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:34,723
See that you don't lose your lives.

428
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:20,452
How beautiful. It's very you.

429
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:24,287
You're a very lucky girl.

430
01:02:25,693 --> 01:02:28,571
Using Nishikigi's room!

431
01:02:28,733 --> 01:02:32,521
You should be grateful.

432
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:34,888
And...

433
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:39,845
Do whatever the man wants you to do.

434
01:02:40,213 --> 01:02:43,762
Learn it with your body.

435
01:02:44,653 --> 01:02:45,688
Understand?

436
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:51,288
Kaedé! Otsuné wants you.

437
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:54,646
Go.

438
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:11,091
Kaedé! Your brother is...

439
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:13,286
...dead!

440
01:03:13,773 --> 01:03:17,891
I heard it just now, that he was dead.

441
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:18,842
We'll be together forever.

442
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:39,608
I think I'll help you get married to Nishikigi.

443
01:05:40,573 --> 01:05:49,652
You love her, don't you?
But the blind man has her.

444
01:05:50,053 --> 01:05:52,613
It's hot!

445
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:54,249
Yes.

446
01:05:59,173 --> 01:06:02,051
She loves you too.

447
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:08,803
She prefers men who can see
to those who can't.

448
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:11,442
What'll I do?

449
01:06:11,653 --> 01:06:14,963
When Zatoichi is making love...

450
01:06:15,053 --> 01:06:19,251
...to her tonight, we'll kill him.

451
01:06:20,133 --> 01:06:23,284
If you help us, I'll give you...

452
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:24,967
...fifty ryo.

453
01:06:27,413 --> 01:06:28,209
Fifty ryo?

454
01:06:28,533 --> 01:06:35,769
Yes.
So talk her into taking the job.

455
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:39,362
A letter from Boss lioka.

456
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:51,885
Idiot! Don't poke your nose in.

457
01:07:04,093 --> 01:07:05,162
Ino.

458
01:07:11,453 --> 01:07:14,490
It's from Boss lioka.

459
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:18,532
He's coming tomorrow to take Zatoichi's head.

460
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:22,891
Will he come here?

461
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,568
Great!

462
01:07:26,133 --> 01:07:29,808
If you kill Zatoichi, you'll be as famous
as the boss.

463
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:35,167
Then I'll get even with Boss lioka.

464
01:07:35,253 --> 01:07:37,642
Your dream will come true.

465
01:07:37,733 --> 01:07:39,724
Idiot!

466
01:07:46,653 --> 01:07:51,090
Why do I have make love to him
in your presence?

467
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:55,687
I don't like it.

468
01:07:56,213 --> 01:08:00,570
But I'll bear it to marry you.

469
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:07,962
If I make love to him once, I'll be free?

470
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:13,048
Yes. And once you're free, we'll be married.

471
01:08:14,813 --> 01:08:16,246
Who said so?

472
01:08:16,573 --> 01:08:19,292
Boss Mangoro. No two ways about it.

473
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:21,924
Mangoro?

474
01:08:23,773 --> 01:08:28,563
Can you rely on his promises?

475
01:12:55,493 --> 01:13:02,524
Take me to Nishikigi.

476
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:14,210
Why do I have to be tied up?

477
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:39,208
Ushi! Where's Zatoichi?

478
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:31,086
Good of you to come, Zatoichi.

479
01:14:32,853 --> 01:14:35,162
Gamblers should live humbly...

480
01:14:35,933 --> 01:14:40,165
...in the shadows of honest people.

481
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:45,807
We shouldn't try for a place in the sun.

482
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:50,846
But you've abused honest people...

483
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:55,484
...and you're walking in the sun.

484
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:06,126
Maybe I've gone a little too far.

485
01:15:06,373 --> 01:15:10,082
Let's have a joke and a drink together.

486
01:15:22,133 --> 01:15:26,490
Nishikigi. Come here.

487
01:15:30,253 --> 01:15:32,005
Go!

488
01:15:42,693 --> 01:15:46,208
You can't see her.

489
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:50,332
She's tied to a post.

490
01:15:55,253 --> 01:15:59,405
If you want to take her back,
you'll drop the stick.

491
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:08,963
Alright. Don't drop the stick.

492
01:16:13,693 --> 01:16:19,962
Help me. Please help me.

493
01:16:28,773 --> 01:16:32,846
What'll you do?

494
01:16:33,973 --> 01:16:36,726
Next time, she'll die.

495
01:16:40,043 --> 01:16:40,839
Do it!

496
01:16:41,003 --> 01:16:42,231
Wait!

497
01:16:56,923 --> 01:16:59,039
Untie her.

498
01:17:08,203 --> 01:17:11,673
Put your hands on this table.

499
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:16,281
I'll have them smashed.

500
01:17:29,363 --> 01:17:33,561
Ushi. I'll let you do it.

501
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:44,160
Those hands caressed her.

502
01:17:45,563 --> 01:17:46,882
You do it.

503
01:18:15,283 --> 01:18:23,201
Without a stick, you can't cross
the river to hell.

504
01:18:25,323 --> 01:18:29,521
You can't use a sword anymore.

505
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:32,916
Give him the stick.

506
01:19:07,203 --> 01:19:13,312
I'll take Nishikigi to you tomorrow.

507
01:19:36,723 --> 01:19:44,516
Ushi. You guided him to this place.

508
01:19:44,923 --> 01:19:48,996
Alright. Go ahead.

509
01:19:54,963 --> 01:19:56,112
Alone.

510
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:02,522
To hell!

511
01:20:16,323 --> 01:20:18,154
You want to join him?

512
01:20:24,683 --> 01:20:26,435
I'll go back...

513
01:20:27,283 --> 01:20:30,798
...to the Ogiya...

514
01:20:32,163 --> 01:20:34,836
That's better.

515
01:20:35,003 --> 01:20:38,439
Money still counts in this world.

516
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:43,515
You can still work.

517
01:21:29,883 --> 01:21:37,153
Zatoichi is going to die. Enjoy the show.

518
01:21:38,163 --> 01:21:46,241
It's my gift to you Boss lioka.

519
01:23:08,403 --> 01:23:12,601
Zatoichi! How are your hands?

520
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:15,722
Mangoro is here, waiting and eager.

521
01:23:16,043 --> 01:23:18,159
Come out!

522
01:24:22,403 --> 01:24:27,477
What are you doing? Kill the monster!

523
01:26:56,203 --> 01:26:58,512
Get moving!

524
01:26:58,803 --> 01:27:05,276
Fight, you damn fools!

525
01:27:05,403 --> 01:27:12,878
You go!

526
01:27:57,723 --> 01:28:06,199
Let me in. I'm Mangoro. Open the door!

527
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:18,275
Please. Keep away.

528
01:28:22,483 --> 01:28:24,121
Forgive me.

529
01:28:57,563 --> 01:28:59,201
Forgive me.

530
01:29:04,283 --> 01:29:06,922
Forgive me.

531
01:29:09,283 --> 01:29:16,758
I said forgive me!

532
01:32:06,003 --> 01:32:11,031
THE END
